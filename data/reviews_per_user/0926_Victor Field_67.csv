The Devil's Advocate," The nominal stars: Pacino, Reeves and Theron. The REAL stars: Baker, Bottin, Greenberg and Powell. And Theron.
","That's demon designer and creator Rick Baker, visual effects consultant Rob Bottin, visual effects designer Richard Greenberg, and visual effects supervisor Stephanie Powell. They and the other FX folks play a major part in 'The Devil's Advocate,' a tale that's certainly watchable and anything but terrible.Keanu Reeves gives one of his better performances as the young lawyer under the spell of his superior, but despite both him and Al Pacino - given full rein to chew up all of New York, never mind the scenery ('They grow egos the size of cathedrals...') - this was Charlize Theron's first chance to prove she was more than a pretty face, and she acts her heart out sufficiently to make her memorable for more than her remarkable beauty. In fact, she nearly makes Taylor Hackford's movie worth watching by herself, until both Pacino and the special effects go WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY over the top in the climax... and the movie self-destructs in its absurd ending. Too bad.'You were a lawyer AND a demon? Insert joke here.' (Paige Halliwell, 'Charmed.')",Null,1,2,24 December 2002
Mission: Impossible III," Tom Cruise, I served with Jennifer Garner. I knew Jennifer Garner. Jennifer Garner was a friend of mine. Tom Cruise, you're no Jennifer Garner.
","Not long before his death, Greg Morris saw the first 'Mission: Impossible' movie and hated it so much he walked out halfway through. I didn't. Walk out, that is. But I disliked it for much the same reasons he did - for all the razzle-dazzle, it was NOT 'Mission: Impossible.' And neither is 'Mission: Impossible III' (I've never seen the second one, but I doubt it's any closer to the real thing); it's more like 'Alias: The Movie,' which may well be what Paramount hired J.J. Abrams for in his debut as a big-screen director, but it's not right somehow.Not only does it have a lot of stylistic similarity - both this movie and quite a few episodes of 'Alias' open with our hero in grave danger followed by an extended flashback to how this came about, both feature extended slow motion, both have Greg Grunberg, and so on - but you can draw parallels between the characters, making it two summers in a row that Abrams' co-writers and 'Alias' alumni Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci have been called on this (remember last year's 'The Island'?).Ethan Hunt is Sydney Bristow (although unlike Sydney, Ethan is really just a cipher - and unlike Jennifer Garner, Tom Cruise never really projects any kind of warmth or anything to make you root for him), his superior officer Brassel is APO director Chase crossed with Jack Bristow (and lets Laurence Fishburne have the best line in the film - 'Please don't interrupt me when I'm asking rhetorical questions'), rookie agent Lindsay Ferris is Rachel Gibson (a wasted Keri Russell, and it's to be hoped that Rachel doesn't meet the fate that greets poor Lindsay), Davian is a less complex Arvin Sloane (Philip Seymour Hoffman, stealing the movie and making me regret there wasn't more of him), the never-really-explained Rabbit's Foot is the Rambaldi device, the guy played by Simon Pegg is Marshall, Ethan's fiancée Julie is Sydney's fiancé in the pilot, and so on. They even have the place names on screen. Frankly, I'm surprised the Bad Robot logo doesn't come along at the end (surprised, and relieved... that thing is scary!). But what this doesn't take from 'Alias' and 'Lost' is the willingness to really go for broke, or indeed the complete and utter absorption; 'Mission: Impossible III' is never unwatchable, but it doesn't really catch fire either - good setpieces, but the climax is something of a damp squib compared to the Vatican break-in or the assault on the bridge; the echoes of what has come before + lack of human feeling = no real investment. (Ironically, the two moments that really strike home are among the simplest - the scene in the helicopter after rescuing Lindsay, and a brief bit in Shanghai where our hero is trying to get the Rabbit's Foot in the road.) Of course, humanity wasn't what the original show was about either, but it WAS about building suspense - this doesn't for the most part, and it also doesn't cut much mustard when compared to almost any episode of 'Alias.'For the most part the cast (Hoffman, Pegg, Fishburne, Russell, Ving Rhames, Billy Crudup, Michelle Monaghan, Maggie Q etc) are free of blame, and Michael Giacchino's score (though not as good as Danny Elfman's) is fine. But while the movie doesn't self-destruct, I wouldn't mind disavowing it... though if it hadn't been called 'Mission: Impossible III' I may have had kinder thoughts.Oh, and Kanye West should be shot.",5,2,4,13 May 2006
50 First Dates," Recommended, especially for fans of Adam Sandler. And Drew Barrymore. And walruses.
","This review contains the odd spoiler.If I had to make a list of my favourite movies, 'The Wedding Singer' would be there for sure; Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore made such a good team (Barrymore has more chemistry with him than she does with Ben Stiller in 'Duplex,' which I saw the day before this), it was inevitable that they'd team up again - '50 First Dates' isn't quite as good, but it's no disgrace either. It's also not an all-out laugh riot, but you don't get the idea that was ultimately the aim of writer George Wing and director Peter Segal.Commitment-phobic Hawaiian marine zoologist Sandler's preference for flings with tourists (Adam Sandler as a woman magnet? Well, it takes all sorts) goes out the window when he sees lovely, likeable Lucy; but he finds out that the woman has short-term memory loss, making it seem as if his usual stance would actually be the best thing this time. Wing's script avoids playing Barrymore's serious plight for major laughs, leaving the humour for Sandler's best friend (a never-more-useless Rob Schneider - many will find the trailer-excerpted scene where she beats him up with a baseball bat to be a highpoint) and for moments like Sandler's sexually indeterminate colleague and a walrus who's almost another friend (if you've ever wanted to see a walrus vomit, here's your chance). They seem to have been added just to reassure people that yes, this IS an Adam Sandler movie.But the movie's essentially a romantic comedy-drama, and thus more sentimental than gross-out, in spite of Barrymore's lisping steroid-abusing brother (Sean Astin), who's just as willing to help maintain her belief that it's still the day of the accident as her father is. (Incidentally, am I the only one to notice that Anonymous Content did both this and the very different brain-damage-romance 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'?) The movie goes for every different variation on its theme, but still seems to go a bit too long - removing the gratuitous gross-out gags might have made a difference to the overall effect - and why are there so many reggae-flavoured songs on the soundtrack for a movie set in the PACIFIC?
All this, however, is forgiven by the end of the movie.WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR SPOILER.I have to admit I was really expecting Lucy (Barrymore) to be cured by the end of the movie and live happily ever after with our hero Henry (Sandler). But kudos to writer Wing for having the guts to not go for the easy way out - at the end of the movie Lucy still has amnesia and isn't even beginning to make a recovery (she's dreaming of Henry, but she still has no idea who he is when they meet at the start of each day), and Henry and her family are still taking care of her. But that doesn't mean it isn't a happy ending... I'm not giving away EVERYTHING. Let's just say all compromises should be this effective.WHICH BRINGS US TO THE END OF OUR SPOILER.Yes, this isn't as affecting as 'Groundhog Day,' and yes, it does have some weak plot points - but Sandler will always be more appealing than some of his fellow comedians (imagine if this starred David Spade, and shudder). And how can you not adore Drew in this one? Plus any movie where a Beach Boys song is crucial to the plot is fine with me.",Null,0,0,9 May 2004
Catch Me If You Can," This isn't from Amblin Entertainment for nothing...
","'Catch Me If You Can' is a good change of pace for Steven Spielberg, who hasn't done a lighthearted movie like this in a long time - after 'Minority Report,' 'A.I. Artificial Intelligence' and 'Saving Private Ryan,' a smaller-scale, factually-based tale would be just the thing. But while no one can possibly call this a bad movie, ultimately it's a bit too light for its own good.It does show how far good actors and a top director can take an uneven screenplay - and since Frank Abangale's book about his exploits as a real-life Great Pretender is adapted by the man who also did 'Rush Hour 2' and 'Speed 2: Cruise Control,' it is pretty uneven. Luckily for us all, Leonardo DiCaprio and company take it almost to the finish; going from the early 1960s to the mid-1970s, our hero Frank starts to fake it when his parents (Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye) have their house repossessed en route to getting divorced, going from pretending to being the substitute French teacher to posing as a Pan Am pilot, and taking it from there. You watch it wondering how far he can go before getting caught, and how he will get caught, and what'll happen then...The story is played for laughs for the most part, but it's handled with so that you never feel it shouldn't be or that he's doing it out of larceny; from the animated opening credits onwards the movie keeps skipping along, but it also takes itself a bit too easy - no sensation that the Fed pursuing him is actually chasing him, and not enough time to build up the people Frank meets along the way, apart from Frank's father. Thank heaven for Spielberg's ability to use actors who can make up for it, like Martin Sheen as the father of the sweet Southern girl (Amy Adams) who our hero comes close to marrying, and Jennifer Garner in a cameo as a model-turned-prostitute who winds up unknowingly paying our hero to have sex with her (some of us would do it for free).'Catch Me If You Can' also has lots of wonderful little moments like our hero getting crash courses in medicine and law from 'Dr. Kildare' and 'Perry Mason' respectively, and Handratty (Tom Hanks)'s knock-knock joke; as with many movies set in the 1960s it also fills the soundtrack with songs from that era, and though some are questionably chosen (Frank and Cheryl (Jennifer Garner) meet up with Dusty Springfield's 'The Look Of Love' playing to set the mood, even though the year is 1964 and the song didn't come out until 1967) they're still good listening, but don't upstage John Williams's score - which, though it's been overpraised by all too many movie critics, probably because it's not loud, is still impressively light a la a lot of his 60s work.The trouble with the movie in the end, however, is... well... the end. It seems to run on for about 20 or so minutes after its natural end, and ultimately just seems to tail off. The movie's likeable and absorbing, but in the end it's no more than a pleasant diversion. But why pick on Spielberg et al for not producing heavyweight movies all the time? As far as cinematic journeys to the 1960s go, it's worth seeing, especially for fans of the cast and director. It's just a shame it doesn't linger long.",Null,0,1,26 April 2003
Minority Report," Water, water everywhere...
","Pairing Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise must undoubtedly be a nightmare for many people, but for those in their fan clubs it had plenty of promise, and 'Minority Report' is a definite return to form for the master after 'A.I. Artificial Intelligence' - itself flawed but not as bad as many claim it is.Like 'Total Recall,' this expands on (and from what I'm told almost totally changes) the Philip K. Dick story it's based on, and if the result is essentially 'The Fugitive' with a bigger budget, harking back to that fine example of Action Movies With A Brain is no bad thing. You all know the plot (Precrime cop Cruise discovers he's wanted for a murder he's going to commit in just over 50 hours and goes on the run, etc.,), but Scott Frank and Jon Cohen's screenplay offers intriguing notions alongside all the thrills, and Spielberg delivers a welcome return to basics - let's not forget this is the man who did 'Duel' and 'Jaws' - while not betraying the 'Thank goodness he's grown up' crowd. (Yes, we all know 'Schindler's List,' 'Amistad,' 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'A.I. Artificial Intelligence' were children's movies, right?) One moment we're experiencing a high-speed chase through an automobile factory, the next we're pondering the ramifications of a system that allows crime to become almost extinct. Somehow I can't imagine 'Scooby-Doo' doing that.The movie's filled with special effects, of course, but Spielberg movies always have them serve the story instead of vice versa, and it continues here - throughout the result is that of a believable future world (love the ever-changing newspapers and magazines). And instead of complaining about the product placement in 'Minority Report' (something which I've personally never really had a problem with), let's look at another aspect of the tale. Throughout the movie, water is a recurring motif; the Twentieth Century Fox and DreamWorks logos are presented through water, several crucial scenes take place around bodies of water (a coastline, a swimming pool), and Cruise's police officer evades his pursuers at one point with the help of an umbrella and a downpour. There may be other theories about this, but since it's associated with the good guys throughout the movie (and note the last shot of the movie), my own view is that you can see through water, and thus get a clear view of what's happening - thus, water = the truth.Whether you agree or not, you have to agree that blockbuster movies that give you a rollercoaster ride and food for thought are to be encouraged. Spielberg, his writers, his crew and cast keep the tension running high for nearly all of its length (the final confrontation between Cruise and the villain is just a bit off, and both it and the first scene are a little too TV-ish for comfort), but in the end 'Minority Report' works for considerably more than a minority of viewers. The master still has it. The Dream still Works.PS: I didn't spot Cameron Diaz, but the lady Cruise and Samantha Morton encounter in the mall does look a lot like Lucy Liu...",9,2,3,16 July 2002
Monster," This is not really a serial killer movie.
","Although it's about a serial killer, 'Monster' isn't devoted to Aileen Wuornos' killings; it's more about the relationship between her and her sheltered-at-first girlfriend Selby. In other words, this is more about a woman who becomes a killer than a killer, full stop.Characterization notwithstanding, Patty Jenkins' movie won't be mistaken for a propaganda piece; it doesn't try and make her an understandable killer (except in the first case), but simply lets us make up our own minds about her. As laid out through Jenkins' script and acted by Charlize Theron, she's hard to take as a human being; foul-mouthed, desperate, hard to control, but also sad and thoughtful - compare her on-screen behaviour to her more measured and introspective voice-over narration, showing the woman inside that no one other than Selby gets close to seeing on screen.In fact, 'Monster' is more or less a two-hander; everyone in the movie other than Theron and a cast-against-type Christina Ricci as Selby is almost a cameo, particularly Pruitt Taylor Vince as one of Aileen's customers. Apparently a lot of people only noticed Charlize Theron's ability to act because of this movie; some of us came to that conclusion a while back (back in 1997, in fact, when she almost singlehandedly redeemed 'The Devil's Advocate'). She may be buried under makeup effects, but it's her doing the emoting, not the looks - this is not the Charlize Theron from 'Mighty Joe Young' or 'Reindeer Games' (although like the latter, 'Monster' takes advantage of her being one of today's most nudity-friendly performers). Both she and Ricci deliver powerful performances which carry the movie, though its point of view helps; it's grimy for sure, and generally depressing from the opening - setting up her life as a prostitute from when she was a teenager - but no one should go into this expecting a cheerful two hours.'Monster' isn't really exploitative (even the love scene between the two leads isn't that graphic), and it's a good watch all round... but in the end, somehow you can't really feel as much for the MOVIE as for its lead characters. It's still worth seeing, however, and it's an eye-opener both for non-Theron fans and for those who want some kind of idea as to what makes a person do the things they do - both in the case of Aileen and in the case of Selby.",Null,0,0,14 August 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Yo-ho-ho and a barrel of passable entertainment.
","'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' is certainly better than the last Disney movie based on a theme park attraction ('The Country Bears') and one of Jerry Bruckheimer's more endurable productions - but it never really catches fire, much as director Gore Verbinski's 'MouseHunt' and 'The Mexican' ultimately didn't cut it either. Although the movie doesn't even wait for the Walt Disney Pictures and Jerry Bruckheimer Films logos in its rush to get started (they're relegated to the very end of the movie), there's not much real excitement to be had.Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush make it worthwhile as rival pirates Sparrow and Barbossa; both put so much relish in the licences to ham it up that are their roles that they fully deserve their billing and more - Depp in particular is a blast from the time we see him arrive at port on a sinking boat, and is fully in the spirit, giving the movie an energy it could use more of. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley ensure that both sexes have somebody to lust after during the two and a half hours (and both do okay in the performances, with Keira's character at least not a wimp), and the movie's certainly never dull - and unlike some other Bruckheimer efforts, never deafening - but somehow despite such a scope it doesn't take off.I blame those scurvy knaves Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, who have a knack for writing movies that promise a lot and never truly deliver (admittedly they worked on 'The Mask Of Zorro' and 'Aladdin,' but they also have 'Small Soldiers,' 'The Road to El Dorado' and the 1998 'Godzilla' on their resume); 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' throws in ghosts, battles on the high seas, narrow escapes and swordfights, but because the movie keeps veering between an all-out adventure and... let's face it... panto, it never settles down; when you see a ship crewed by skeletons and the first thing that comes to mind is Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' video, it's hard not to think you're taking the movie even less seriously than the makers want you to.The score doesn't help either - many fans weren't pleased when Alan Silvestri was replaced on the project by Klaus Badelt and a whole band of other Media Ventures composers, and the resulting Hans Zimmer-soundalike doesn't help proceedings. This is a pretty good time-passer, and the work of Industrial Light and Magic, Captive Audience Productions, Digiscope, Boy Wonder etc can't be faulted (and it's nice to see that there's still a place for miniatures in these CGI days), but 'Sinbad: Legend Of The Seven Seas' made much less money and was much more fun. And it had better music. I'll stick with 'Armageddon,' which has Liv Tyler and is therefore instantly preferable to this one, Keira Knightley notwithstanding.All that said, the scene after the end credits should NOT be missed.",Null,0,2,3 January 2004
Beauty and the Beast," One of my all-time favourite movies.
","The only animated movie to receive a Best Picture Oscar nomination, and it deserved it.Magic from the opening prologue to the final credit, 'Beauty and the Beast' is the last real classic to come from the Disney crew before John Lasseter came along. This was one of the few movies I happily paid to see twice in the cinema, and sitting in a sparsely-populated Friday night audience (I was living in Barbados at the time, and it was hardly the most artistic place on Earth... it was a crying shame that there was hardly anyone there while 'Home Alone 2' went through the roof) the second time, the magic remained.You all know the story, so apart from pointing out the movie's one flaw (the prince's spell had to be broken before he turned 21 or he would remain a beast forever; so if it was cast ten years before the events of the movie, wouldn't that mean he was 11 when the spell was cast...?), let's look at how well the movie works. You have a monster who's more human than the movie's medallion-man villain; you have a heroine who's PC but engaging with it; you have a supporting cast of magic utensils who wisely never upstage the couple at the centre of this love story (and despite the Disney animated trappings, it IS a love story); and you have a captivating story, beautifully told.The movie's also got wonderful design of its French setting and characters, with the ballroom scene a standout (the tiny but appreciative audience were impressed by the sight of the Beast and Belle in their evening wear - the only time I've ever seen cartoon characters get wolf-whistled in a cinema); and Alan Menken's score is his finest work for the Mouse, with matchless lyrics from the late and much lamented Howard Ashman - how many musicals can you name where ALL the songs are brilliant? But ultimately it's the movie's very real heart that makes it a keeper; the cliche 'You'll laugh, you'll cry' is all too true in this case. A lot of movies called 'classic' don't deserve that appellation, but this one does.I'll be slaughtered by anime fans, but what the hell... one 'Beauty and the Beast' is worth a thousand 'Akira's. And 'Shrek's. And, I'm willing to bet, 'Treasure Planet's. This is a truly adult animated feature that's also one for the entire family. Forget 'The Silence of the Lambs' - this is the real best picture of 1991.",10,201,228,2 January 2003
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," One down, six to go. Hopefully.
","While 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' (now there's a mouthful) is in no way a bad movie, it still falls short of its own aspirations. And quite possibly Walt Disney and Walden's; though there's no proof, it's difficult not to think this is the opening salvo of their me-too response to certain other movie series (we all know which ones, so I won't name them). Especially since Peter Jackson's movie(s) seem very much like an organic product; this seems more like an assembly line, though still very far away from a failure.Giving the roles of the Pevensie children to four stronger actors would have helped, though director Andrew Adamson has to share the blame; it's not always that stirring, and the story loses itself towards the end (and unlike, say, 'King Kong' or any of the entries in Jackson's trilogy, it doesn't wear its length that well - although ironically this clocks in at a comparatively economical 140 minutes). Perhaps he's not quite as used to dealing with live actors as with animated characters like Shrek. (Although some of the CGI is suspect, meaning Aslan. If only he'd been assigned to Industrial Light & Magic instead of Rhythm & Hues.)Then again, Adamson does get excellent performances from Tilda Swinton as the White Witch and James McEvoy as Mr. Tumnus, and the stodgy beginning and slightly fizzled finale is made up for by just about everything from the point Lucy discovers Narnia; Harry Gregson-Williams' score and the voice work helps, although having Alanis Morrisette and Tim Finn warbling over the credits doesn't. I'll be back for the second movie (it's surely not going to perform badly enough to rule out the next one) but ultimately Bill Melendez's TV cartoon version from the '70s is better.And yes, I did get the Christian allegories, but it didn't bother me. We don't all have a thing against religion here, you know. :)",7,1,2,2 January 2006
Madagascar," Don't give me the stars - give me the penguins!
","While I didn't get much of a kick out of 'Madagascar,' the star rating is taking into accounta) the fact that this was aimed more at younger viewers, and b) the fact that this is less painful to watch than 'Shark Tale.' (Granted, this is like saying that 'Highway To Heaven' is less anodyne than 'Little House on the Prairie,' but still.)Short and colourful, but with a pretty thin storyline, our main characters of Alex the urban one, Gloria the practical one, Melman the nervous one and Marty the wild one (believe me, they don't get developed much more than that) aren't all that amusing or appealing, and the movie gets much better whenever the spotlight falls on the escaping penguins or the lemur king and his second-in-command. More of them would have made a lot of difference (and with the movie's box office returns, the possibility of DreamWorks spinning them off into a TV series shouldn't be ruled out).'Madagascar' also trots out some very weak cultural gags, some of which really stick out in what's supposed to be a movie for kids (Alex's 'American Beauty' dream with roses replaced by steaks, complete with Thomas Newman's original music? A 'Cast Away' gag with a ball called Spalding? And can someone point out that it might not be a good idea to remind older viewers of better movies from the same company?), and the heavy doses of non-original music just make the new stuff by Hans Zimmer and Co. seem weaker than ever. Add to this animation that's on the same level as 'Father of the Pride' and a very annoying dosage of 'I Like To Move It,' and you have one very mediocre animated feature. (How mediocre? I've seen Don Bluth movies that come over stronger. Don Bluth movies from the 1990s.) Oh, for the days when animated movies didn't feel compelled to rely on name voices. But again, thank goodness for the penguins. Smile and wave indeed...",5,0,1,31 July 2005
The Girl Next Door," The sweetest R-rated (or 15 certificate) movie in recent memory.
","Responsibility for 'The Girl Next Door''s poor performance at the US box office - as well as over here - can be laid firmly at the feet of Twentieth Century Fox's marketing people; the tagline 'Matt never saw her coming - but all his friends had!' made it seem like a full-on sex comedy, when it's actually a lot more than that; director Luke Greenfield and writers Stuart Blumberg, David T. Wagner and Brent Goldberg put more emphasis on the characters than the raunch, which makes all the difference. There's more to the movie than the sight of Elisha Cuthbert in a thong (in interviews she revealed that it is indeed her there... if not elsewhere in the movie).The debt this movie owes to 'Risky Business' - starting with the score by ex-Tangerine Dream member Paul Haslinger (Tangerine Dream scored 'Risky Business') - is pretty clear; both movies have bright but slightly life-challenged graduate students given to fantasising about things that go wrong as their main characters (step forward Emile Hirsch as the sympathetic hero), both have sex-obsessed best friends, both have women in the sex business as the main female characters who come into the hero's uptight life and help to liberate him, and both have sleazy male bosses (Timothy Olyphant plays the Guido equivalent). The movie also has the same mostly restrained view of its story where other movies would have played up the farce aspects - the only real hi-jinks come when the movie's plot takes in the Adult Film Convention in Las Vegas - but 'The Girl Next Door' is a lot more engaging and has a lot more heart than 'Risky Business' (good though that movie is, charm is not its strong point), with the title character seen as more of a person than a masturbatory object both by our hero and by the movie. When she goes with a motel with him and starts to play up The Porn Star, you really hope they don't go through with it.The mood set up in the early stages is so convincing that when Olyphant's porn producer character turns up the movie seems to turn into another one entirely (and if you go to see this because of Elisha's 'one for the men' status, I must warn you that she spends alarming amounts of time off-screen); it's still a good one, but it damages the overall movie's tone, and for most of the rest of the movie it veers back and forth between sweet and sleazy... but the amazing thing is that 'The Girl Next Door' actually manages to find a happy balance of the two by the time the prom climax arrives (with more echoes of 'Risky Business' en route, for sure).True, there's no actual sex seen and little nudity, but the cast works so well and the movie's so sincere that by the end it doesn't seem like a ripoff. With good use of songs blending with the score, well-done fantasy sequences, and a welcome dose of intelligence in its writing, 'The Girl Next Door' is probably the most adorable movie to get an R rating since 'Pretty Woman,' and well worth seeing even if you don't have a thing for Kim off '24.' But this isn't for the 'Daily Sport' crowd. Which is their loss.'The juice was worth the squeeze.'",Null,251,304,23 April 2004
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Ironically considering it's about ice and water, it's not cold or particularly drippy. But remember, it's all about Scrat.
","You can tell how much I liked 'Ice Age' by this little nugget; flying back from a holiday a couple of years back, I watched this (again) in a Portuguese dub and 'Daddy Day Care' in English. The latter was by far the more painful experience.The trouble is, the first film was so self-contained it's hard to see how they could have gotten a sequel out of it, and 'Ice Age: The Meltdown,' though not really deserving to be dubbed 'Ice Age: The Letdown,' is indeed a step down from the first one. The animation is, if anything, better this time around (and conclusive proof that it's a lot easier to animate water than it used to be); it's the story that's the problem... this time around there isn't much of one, and the story and characters were a major part of what made 'Ice Age' work - Sid and Diego are sidelined here in favour of Manfred's worrying about his being the last mammoth on Earth (a feeling the first movie handled far more movingly in the cave drawings scene than in this entire flick), with Diego's fear of water seemingly thrown in when the writers remember they have to do something with him.We won't talk about Sid being the Fire King. Or most of the songs.The movie also fudges a bit with the thawed-out predators pursuing our heroes on their journey to escape the flood; even though they actually do kill one of the animals they never really emerge as much of a threat (compare them to Sharptooth in 'The Land Before Time,' with which this shares the basic premise) - and when you think about it, not since 'Casper' has a film aimed so much at younger viewers had such an obsession with death, what with one key scene involving a deceased mammoth and the threat of extinction looming over all their heads. And frankly, the most important major characters introduced - Ellie, The Mammoth Who Thought She Was A Possum (emphasised because it sounds like the kind of 'The Wonderful World Of Disney' episodes I always used to hate as a boy - and as a man, come to think of it) and her genuine possum brothers - are all really, really irritating.However, there's still a lot of entertainment here. Sid, Manny and especially Diego remain engaging, and the vulture voiced by Will 'Gob Bluth' Arnett really deserved more time; John Powell's score is one of his better efforts (although I still prefer David Newman's work on the first film - pity he didn't return); and Scrat has considerably less difficulty stealing the movie than he has in hanging on to his nut (I shamelessly confess to being more gripped by his travails than by the main story). So, not quite up to the first film or 'Robots' but still far superior to yer garden variety DreamWorks.One thing though - like 'Robots,' the UK release version of 'Ice Age: The Meltdown' has a tacked-on pop song from a British artist. While I didn't like how it turned out there, it's even worse here, with most of Powell's end credit score suite junked in favour of a chronically out-of-place ditty from the talentless ex-boyband oaf that is Lee Ryan - who also redubs a character in the movie - and said aural plague isn't even on the soundtrack album. (Thank goodness, or better yet thank Varese Sarabande.) Why they felt the need to do this, I do not understand. At least with 'Robots' they got someone who wasn't crap...",6,5,6,4 May 2006
Spider-Man 2," 'Go get 'em, tiger.'
","The chances of 'Spider-Man 2' being little more than a rehash of the first movie were, when you think about it, pretty remote - the TLC with which the original was handled meant we weren't likely to get a soulless cash-in; indeed, the sequel gives characters the priority over action, and that's what makes this movie an equal to the first one. It may not have its freshness, but it has just about everything else.Director Sam Raimi and screenwriter Alvin Sargent (the latter successfully negating the influence of Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, who share screen story credit with Michael Chabon, and whose (dis)credits include 'Smallville,' 'Shanghai Noon' and 'Lethal Weapon 4') don't tell the most original story - as another poster pointed out, this shares some plot points with 'Superman II,' chiefly that of our hero wondering if he can continue playing the hand fate dealt him and choosing not to... at least for now (but better that than 'Superman IV: The Quest For Peace,' right?) - and on thinking it over it has its share of plot holes, but nothing that truly wrecks the movie. For a start, 'Spider-Man 2' gives us a Peter Parker whose angsty day-to-day life is immensely easy to sympathies with - he may be able to zoom around the city spinning webs and have amazing strength, but that can't help him keep a job or pay his rent. It also gives us people who've moved on and been built up from last time - except perhaps for J. Jonah Jameson (wonderfully played by J.K. Simmons - 'Miss Brant? Get me a violin,' he says on hearing Peter's tale of woe), who wisely has more screen time... but not enough for him to swipe the movie. Apart from Rosemary Harris's Aunt May, the biggest beneficiary of this emphasis on people is Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane, who is inevitably in peril in the climax but gets much more to do beforehand this time around; you wonder if the producers swore that come the sequel they'd do something about the first movie's flaws (speaking of which, the effects from John Dykstra and Sony Pictures Imageworks et al are considerably improved).Even the movie's villain isn't truly a black hat; as written and played by Alfred Molina, Dr. Octavius is more of an ambitious thinker trapped by his own devices than an all-out baddie - the way he becomes Doc Ock is more of an accident than anything, though I can understand why this pretty thoughtful approach would put some off - it takes a while before the action really starts (though when it comes, it's worth it), and the emotional moments aren't for the Michael Bay crowd. But if they weren't there, the action scenes wouldn't have any impact. Think about it.Leavened throughout with humour that works for the movie instead of against it (although having a street musician play the theme from the 'Spider-Man' cartoon is a bit much - the Michael Buble big band version at the end of the end credits is enough), sporting a score by Danny Elfman (with a little help from John Debney and Christopher Young) that shows Klaus Badelt and Graeme Revell how this kind of thing should be done, and with a perfect set-up for 'Spider-Man 3' thrown in - all this and Bruce Campbell - this shows again why few if anybody is plumping for Nicholas Hammond over Tobey Maguire. He IS Spider-Man, and this set of movies is the definitive portrayal of Marvel's most famous creation; wealth and fame he's ignored, but merited.Incidentally, those viewers who complained about the last image of the previous movie will have less to moan about here. Particularly the boys.",Null,0,0,5 September 2004
Finding Nemo," You know what they say about not fixing something that ain't broke...
","A number of folks have complained about 'Finding Nemo' not being up to the standards of 'Toy Story,' 'A Bug's Life,' 'Toy Story 2' and 'Monsters, Inc.' - and it's true that it's not perfect; when you think about it, the Andrew Stanton/Bob Peterson/David Reynolds script has a slightly similar plot to the adventures of Buzz, Woody et al (for a toy being taken read a little clownfish missing). Plus the movie suffers from a few too many climaxes (probably because unlike most American animated features, this has a three-figure running time), and there's a definite sign of a formula to Pixar movies.But we'd be so much better off if all movies had it: Pixar movies have proper screenplays, packed with wit and warmth (and restraint - like the pinnacle of the climax of 'A Bug's Life,' the horrible incident that launches the movie takes place off screen); they have good casts performing the characters, with a particular nod here to Ellen DeGeneres, Geoffrey Rush, Barry Humphries and Willem Dafoe (though one wishes Nemo had a bit more dimension to him); they have plenty of effort put into the look of the movie (one of the strongest achievements is that the undersea world of the Pacific is a lot more comforting than the dry land world of Australia, so that you feel alarmed whenever the action cuts to Sydney); and they have the sense to not go overboard with any cultural references.It has to be said that it's a bit slow going at first, but fears that it'll be Pixar's first real disappointment are soon allayed; with some impressive animation, plenty of fine moments throughout and a wonderful score from Thomas Newman that gives the proceedings a breath of fresh musical air after his cousin Randy's efforts (so when can we expect David Newman to work for Pixar?), this ultimately ends up as another good effort from the bouncing lamp - who else would have a family movie include the music credit ''The Murder' Written By Bernard Herrmann' (it serves as the 'theme' for an Elmyra Duff type who Nemo's in great danger from in the air-breathers' world)? It goes without saying that staying for the closing titles is a must, Robbie Williams's undesired song notwithstanding - no 'outtakes' this time, but never mind.'I shall call him Squishy and he shall be mine.

That Thing You Do!," My kind of film.
","Say what you like about Tom Hanks, but at least he didn't use his clout in Hollywood to write, direct and act in something overwhelmingly pretentious. That's just one of the many points in the film's favour - others include its infectious good nature and its appealing characters (when the title song by the Wonders is played on the radio for the first time you're as excited as the characters are). It doesn't overstay its welcome, and the only problem is that the ending is a bit abrupt. But it's so darn agreeable and fun that it doesn't matter.  As a lifelong Gerry Anderson fan I was thrilled to see a TV screen showing his series 'Fireball XL5,' I love TV theme songs (and the fictional one for 'Mr. Downtown' is a cracker), and I seem to have a soft spot for anything with Liv Tyler (so I guess I'd like 'Stealing Beauty' then). Loved it.",Null,1,2,27 November 1999
Troy," 'When does it end?' 'It never ends.'
","David Benioff's screenplay for 'Troy' is supposedly inspired by Homer's 'The Iliad.' I assume that's Homer as in Simpson - except that when 'The Simpsons' did their look at Greek legend it hewed somewhat closer to the originals (I'm serious). And it was also a lot more interesting.While Benioff and director Wolfgang Petersen deserve credit for not painting one side or the other as outright villains, it has the effect of reducing any emotional involvement - already minimal thanks to how the characters are drawn and played. Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole supply some true strength as Hector and the king of Troy respectively, but Brad Pitt is just not right as Achilles, coming off more like David Beckham playing at soldiers, the fight scenes notwithstanding. But even Mr. Aniston is better than Orlando Bloom as Paris, who's too drippy to even talk about, so let's move on.When the characters aren't talking and just letting the fighting speak, the movie's okay, but some strong battle scenes do not a movie make, especially if said movie takes so many liberties with its source (the way the Achilles heel reference is worked in just does not wash - it's as if they wanted to keep it 'real,' and the whole Achilles-made-immune-by-the-River-Styx thing didn't fit). And Diane Kruger is not only no actress, but also isn't the kind of woman you can see men killing each other over, looker though she undoubtedly is. (If Warner Bros. was looking for a woman believably hot enough to cause a war and with the right look to boot, they could have cast Monica Bellucci or Jessica Alba - the latter wouldn't have been that much more out of place than Mr. Bloom.)In an interview with the London 'Evening Standard,' Petersen said that this is not 'The Lord of the Rings,' and he was right - 'The Lord of the Rings' was an epic movie (OK, three epic movies) that felt cinematic; 'Troy' is a movie that feels like a bad 1980s miniseries, especially with the DOA dialogue. Never truly involving, saddled with a James Horner score that isn't even close to what Gabriel Yared originally wrote (before it was thrown out after complaints at a preview), and seemingly going on forever, the overall effect is to make you long for another look at 'Spartacus,' 'The Ten Commandments,' or any episode of 'Xena: Warrior Princess' set in Greece. Or, indeed, 'The Lord of the Rings.'",Null,1,3,6 June 2004
Chicken Run," Animation, good; music, good; film, overrated...
","I know I should have loved this, but the scene where the 'crate' was unveiled cemented it for me... this was a plasticine take on 'A Bug's Life' by way of 'The Great Escape,' and not a patch on either.Aardman's animation is great, of course; and like the subsequent (and also (though less) overrated) 'Shrek' it has a terrific score by John Powell and Harry Gregson-Williams that played a big part in getting me through this film. Unfortunately, maybe it was too big a part - some Luddites object strenously to sitting through the Disney/Pixar movies because they're CGI animated instead of being done by hand (and they don't know what they're missing...), but John Lasseter and Co. devote as much time to the story and characters as they do to the animation. Here we're served up an ex-RAF rooster called Fowler who's an intentional stiff-upper-lip British stereotype - but everyone else is a stereotype as well (from the fellow chickens to the human villain Mrs. Tweedy). I should have been laughing and I should have been cheering them on as they try and try again to escape, and to be fair it does have an entertaining finale; but for the most part 'Chicken Run' just doesn't really engage the emotions the way it should. What with this and 'A Close Shave' (which everyone other than me seems to have found a masterpiece), it's beginning to look as if Nick Park peaked with the truly classic 'The Wrong Trousers.' Or maybe this should have been a half-hour project. I'll stick with Buzz Lightyear and 'The Red And The Blue', thanks. For you, the review is over.PS: For those wondering what the 'crate' is... sorry, you'll need to see the movie. Or 'A Bug's Life,' which is where we came in.",Null,0,0,26 December 2001
The Day After Tomorrow," It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel okay.
","'The Day After Tomorrow' is a disaster movie, but it isn't a disastrous one. But if Roland Emmerich really thought he was making a movie with a message, he didn't quite succeed - to be honest, Emmerich is to serious film-making as Naomi Wolf is to recommending 'Voluptuous' magazine. The fact that the movie begins with the Twentieth Century Fox logo under stormy skies doesn't make it any more significant.Well-intentioned it may be, but the movie's plot takes second place to the imagery - the opening credits over an icy landscape, the massive weather systems over the planet, colossal hailstones pelting down on Tokyo, snowstorms over India, tidal waves - and the numerous effects houses make it an eye candy feast, especially for people with a grudge against the Big Apple (kudos to Industrial Light and Magic, Digital Domain and all the less renowned FX companies involved). So on that level, it works; the music by Harald Kloser and Thomas Wanker is also a bonus, being more restrained and serious in its support than is usually the way with Emmerich movies.And then there's the script - it has a whole load of characters but doesn't do much with any of them. Example: Climatologist Dennis Quaid's relationship with son Jake Gyllenhaal doesn't seem to be as estranged as it's intended to be, and similarly the friendship Quaid has with a longtime colleague gets about as much emphasis as the crush his younger colleague has on fellow scientist Tamlyn Tomita (and the movie pays for it later on in a sequence shamelessly ripped off from 'Vertical Limit,' which has little of the emotional resonance it should). In fact, all the human elements - Gyllenhaal's repressed feelings for classmate Emmy Rossum, his doctor mother Sela Ward's problems with a young patient, etc - all of them are underdeveloped or just plain undeveloped, and some moments practically scream 'Contrived Climax Ahoy!' Those moments are there because 'The Day After Tomorrow' doesn't have an enemy as a natural outgrowth of its story; the elements aren't really villainous as they have no concept of right or wrong, and the closest thing to a villain here is the current administration in the White House, so Emmerich and co-writer Jeffrey Nachmanoff have to impose a tangible enemy (why else are those wolves there?) on the proceedings. This does help things from getting totally boring in the second half, though it's still pretty watchable even then - but if some more thought had been put into the screenplay, like exploring the characters or developing the promising ideas therein (like Americans fleeing to Mexico, or further looks at the Government side), it would have carried more weight and made the movie into more than an improvement on 'Godzilla.' As it is, it's a competently done if implausible attention-holder that wants to be more; that it actually had the potential to be more makes it a bit of a disappointment, but at least it's a watchable one.",Null,156,242,6 June 2004
The Polar Express," It might have been better as a TV special.
","Robert Zemeckis is one of the few filmmakers, along with Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton, whose movies I make a point of seeing - and though his efforts as a producer have been weak ('The Public Eye,' 'The Frighteners'), he's never directed a movie I hated, although he came really close with 'Death Becomes Her.' 'The Polar Express' doesn't sink to that level, but it's still something of a misfire.It's not the animation that's a problem - for all the complaints others have made about how creepy the characters are, the only one who truly qualifies is Hero Girl (imagine Queen Latifah if she was a dwarf), and this movie is the kind that could probably only be done with some kind of extraordinary animation... for the genuinely unnerving kind, see 'The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb.' The trouble is that Zemeckis and co-writer William Broyles Jr. have taken a source that by all accounts (I haven't read the Chris Van Allsburg book) is a quite simple story and blown it up without adding much of any real help; a boy who's not too full of the Christmas spirit is picked up by the Polar Express to go to the North Pole to get it first hand - sounds like it should be full of wonder and emotion. But for some reason it isn't.A lot of the time the movie's pretty cold for reasons beyond it being snow-driven; the characters don't get much to build them (unusual for a director who often fills his movies with so much warmth and appealing characters), and some moments that should be show-stoppers like the 'Hot Chocolate' number somehow fall flat. While the movie does get better as it goes along and it's certainly impressive to look at (and some of the vocal performances are fine, especially Tom Hanks and the late Michael Jeter - to whom the movie's dedicated), 'The Polar Express' may have been better served by being a half-hour TV special; 'The Snowman' and 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer' didn't need 90 minutes to tell their stories well, and they're still on TV 20 and 40 years after their first airings.And in spite of the movie's attempts to make the Josh Groban song its main musical element, for my money it's the title track that's the real standout song; it's not only good to listen to, but also brings back pleasant memories of the old Rankin/Bass specials, which have tons of genuine Christmas feeling and are also fun. Something that 'The Polar Express,' for all its good points, ultimately doesn't qualify as - but there have been far, far worse Christmas movies over the past 10 years ('Jingle All The Way' and the remake of 'Miracle On 34th Street' come to mind). I don't regret seeing this, but where's Frosty the Snowman when you need him?",6,0,2,27 December 2004
Lost in Translation," Sofia Coppola tried making pictures, but they were mediocre.
","'Lost in Translation' is best seen for what it is - a small, intimate movie rather than a life-changing Classic Movie Experience. Nothing much really happens, and it all seems like Sofia Coppola's vacation clips stitched together with some fragments of a plot; if she wanted to make a movie from a tourist's point of view, she succeeded completely. But it seems, personally, like 'Frantic' all over again; in that movie what should have been a thriller was buried under the feeling of being a stranger in a strange land, and here it's all mood and not much else. Filmed in a subdued manner and with a lack of underscore (there's so little that the credit for 'original music' comes as a shock), it's almost like a slightly subpar HBO offering.Though it's hard not to think a lot of the movie's problems would be solved if the actor and the graduate had simply bothered to buy an English-Japanese/Japanese-English dictionary (but then, it would have robbed Sofia Coppola of some chances for amusing scenes where they try to get by without knowing the language), 'Lost in Translation' is the kind of movie that's best enjoyed for the individual pleasures rather than the whole. Like Bill Murray's fine turn as the washed-up screen actor; the very lovely Scarlett Johansson as the graduate; the dance of the Japanese TV chat show host; Murray and Johansson doing karaoke; and the women bouncing in the swimming pool as Murray swims.No real fireworks, and too fragmented to make the major impression its supporters claim for it, but not the massively overrated bore others argue it is either. In the end, the movie IS watchable after the lingering opening shot of Scarlett Johansson's bottom, even if it never quite matches it.",Null,0,1,24 July 2004
Corpse Bride," The best family movie about necrophilia ever...
","'Tim Burton's Corpse Bride' isn't as good as 'The Nightmare Before Christmas,' but in its defence it isn't a retread. Apart from the whole Rankin/Bass special on acid thing, which is in no way a criticism.This quasi-musical-comedy-horror tale of a betrothed man accidentally married to a corpse gets off to a somewhat stodgy start as it gets its somewhat slim story underway - it might have been suited more for a short story than a movie - and although leaving most of its cast for the movie's credits rather than the posters, even in Britain, is a welcome move (because it gives the movie itself the centre stage, not the cast), it has to be said that Johnny Depp is almost bland as the voice of Victor; maybe it might have helped if he sang. Also, the visual trick of having the world of the living be just one tone away from being black and white and the world of the dead in full, vibrant colour wears thin before the end, although that's just about the only thing about the visuals that doesn't.But as the tale moves along it gets both funnier and more involving, with Danny Elfman's variable songs (as the voice of Bonejangles, he gets the best one) made up for by his own familiar but still effective score; the movie might not have much story, but it also doesn't overstay its welcome... which, given that the ultimate revelation about Barkis (an excellent Richard E. Grant) isn't much of a revelation at all, is probably just as well. With terrific stop-motion animation throughout to boot and a great wedding finale (though I won't give away who gets hitched), this movie may not be for everyone, but it's ultimately a delight.Ironically for a movie where nearly everyone is dead, this is full of life.",7,1,2,15 November 2005
"Monsters, Inc."," The Britney Spears of CGI - Oops! Pixar's done it again...
","10 reasons why 'Monsters, Inc.' was robbed by 'Shrek' at the Oscars:1. The writing holds together better - there isn't a single wasted bit in the movie, from the simulation at the beginning to the seemingly pointless croaky-voiced martinet for paperwork who turns out to be... but that would be telling.2. The humour is less scatological and more character-based.3. The animation is so effective that it's hard to believe it's animation (two highlights are Sullivan's sleigh ride down a snowy mountain at night and the door chase climax - door chase? Just see the movie)...4. ...but the movie never gives you a chance to just wind up being amazed at how it looks and forget about how it feels.5. It doesn't try and impress you with its pop-culture references and how clever it is generally (there is a restaurant called Harryhausen's, but that doesn't really count).6. The voice performances; one of the tests of a cartoon is if the voice cast isn't distracting, and save the Abominable Snowman (voice of John 'Cliff Clavin' Ratzenberger) that isn't the case. Kudos all round, but particularly Crystal, Goodman, Coburn, and Bonnie Hunt as the aforementioned martinet (see #1).7. Only one 'proper' song, and even then it's by the great Randy Newman.8. The relationship between Sullivan and Boo (the little girl who gets into Monstropolis) is genuinely touching.9. The end credits not only feature always welcome 'outtakes' but also follow up a plot strand from the movie itself.10. No DreamWorks tit-for-tat pokes.But then, they don't need to - movies like 'Toy Story,' 'A Bug's Life,' 'Toy Story 2' and this one speak for themselves.",Null,3,5,22 June 2002
The Aviator," Maybe the third time Kate Beckinsale and Josie Maran appear in the same movie will be the charm.
","'The Aviator' may be directed by Martin Scorsese, written by John Logan (although I've never been a fan of 'Gladiator' and I fell asleep watching 'Star Trek: Nemesis'... fortunately he also wrote 'Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas'), produced by Michael Mann (among others) and performed by an acclaimed cast, but its real stars are all behind the camera. It's beautifully shot (by Robert Richardson) and designed (by Dante Ferreti), and edited almost too precisely by Thelma Schoonmaker, and the Sony Pictures Imageworks visual effects manage to make the flight scenes convincing (something that doesn't often happen when the subject is real planes). Howard Shore's sparingly spotted score is another plus.All this effort, sadly, only results in a movie that's wonderful to watch but never really particularly... well... good. The movie shows us a Howard Hughes who's a hypochondriac, an obsessive and a lover of flight, but if you knew that going in it's not likely to expand your knowledge of him or make him seem like any more of a human being, and while Leonardo DiCaprio tries hard it's not until well into the movie before he comes across like Hughes and less like someone impersonating Hughes. But he's not as much of a drawback as Cate Blanchett (who's indescribably annoying as Katharine Hepburn), although Alan Alda does a much better job as his senatorial nemesis, and indeed it's decently acted overall.This hollow core of the movie makes it a lot better as an exercise in appreciating technical expertise and impressive visuals than as something that makes you feel and enthrals you; it's got an epic length, but it's only compelling in fits and starts. You come out of it feeling you might be better off reading a good book about him instead, rather than WANTING to read more about him (there is a difference). 'The Aviator' reminds you that Martin Scorsese, for all his impressive credentials, was a willing participant in 'Shark Tale.' But it's a vast improvement over 'Van Helsing,' the last time Kate Beckinsale (fine as Ava Gardner) and Josie Maran were in the same movie. Of course, most things would be.",5,3,5,29 January 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Book me on the next journey to Middle Earth.

In amongst an otherwise fine cast, she's the only one of the principals who seems to not believe where she is; her performance suggests she thinks she's in a perfume commercial (you almost expect her to say 'Obsession.

Lilo & Stitch," A very un-Disney-like Disney animation. And not in a bad way.
","'Lilo & Stitch' is unusual for a Disney animated movie in that it actually seems to take place in the real world (not to mention the present day), despite the latter half of the title being a genetic creation from another galaxy. Devoid of almost everything that people come to expect when the name 'Walt Disney Pictures' appears on screen - which is not to say we're in 'Golgo 13' territory here - this, as did 'The Emperor's New Groove,' suggests that though the box office takings may go down, the House of Mouse may yet pull another 'Beauty and the Beast' on us one day.The movie's a breath of fresh air not only in its setting - it's set on the Hawaiian island of Kauai - but also in its characters; Lilo is a little girl being brought up by her big sister Nani following their parents' death (offscreen), and the movie's not afraid to indicate that it's tough for both of them. They, along with their social worker Cobra Bubbles and friend David, constitute a rare sighting of proper human beings in Disney cartoons (see also, surprisingly, Lucky Piquel from 'Bonkers'), the reward writer-directors Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois get for putting the emphasis on the emotions rather than on the chase element of the plot (Stitch/Experiment 626 was created by a scientist in violation of the laws of his planet; when Stitch escaped, his creator and an 'E-arth' expert were sent to bring him back) or on the potential for slapstick - though it's there and it's certainly used, the focus is purely on heart.The realness of the movie means that 'Lilo & Stitch' often feels like a live action movie that just happens to be drawn (at one point Stitch sees a 1950s SF movie on TV, and the movie in question is shown as a genuine film clip). Usually that's a bad thing if the 'toon in question strives to be realistic, but in this case there are so many elements that don't come naturally - seen any koala/dog hybrid-Elvis Presley wannabes on the beach lately? - that it still works. If there's a downside, it's that the scenes of the alien pursuers are for the most part almost a distraction... but even then the human element ups the involvement, with the added bonus of there being no real 'bad guys' per se (yes, I said bonus - it's nice to see a Disney movie where there isn't a traditional black-hatted villain, just people doing their jobs).And if all else fails, take into consideration the fact that it's also often genuinely funny; the fact that it never condescends to its audience; the fact that you actually have real Hawaiians (the voices of Tia Carrere and Jason Scott Lee) as key Hawaiian characters; and the fact that the songs used here actually have a purpose (to add dimension to our heroes - Lilo is a major fan of Elvis and tries to reach Stitch through the King), something many live-action movies often forget. 'Lilo & Stitch' would be something worth seeing even if it wasn't a Disney film; seeing that it is... moving forward was always one of Walt's credos. It's encouraging to see that they're actually capable of following his ethos without the help of Pixar.One major flaw though: in spite of the presence of Elvis, Wynonna and Alan Silvestri, the British release version has well-known song-murderer Gareth Gates slaughtering 'Suspicious Minds' over the end credits. Thank heaven someone invented the 'mute' button.",Null,54,69,22 March 2003
The Village," Actually, I've always been a city boy.
","M. Night Shyamalan was allegedly less than pleased with how 'Stuart Little' (which he co-wrote) turned out. After 'The Village' I know which one I'd happily see again (clue: not the one which doesn't have talking animals).The man must have been influenced by 'The Twilight Zone' growing up; fondness for twist endings aside (though I still think 'The Sixth Sense' was better when it was called 'Jacob's Ladder'), 'Signs' isn't far removed from 'The Invaders,' and 'The Village' is similarly not a thousand miles removed from 'A Hundred Yards Over The Rim' - but whereas 'Signs' was an improvement over its predecessor, this one would have Rod Serling rolling in his grave. For those who haven't seen that episode, it's set in the 19th century and involves Cliff Robertson leaving a wagon train to seek medication for his ill son... it wouldn't be fair to go further, but what happens to him isn't completely dissimilar to what happens to the main character in the movie. Apart, of course, from it being short, well written, well acted, and not being pretentious drivel. 'The Village' is hopelessly convinced it's more meaningful than it really is - Roger Deakins' striking(ish) photography doesn't make up for pacing that aims for 'thoughtful' and 'careful' but hits 'boring' and 'up itself' instead, and actionably-bad acting from just about everyone except Bryce Dallas Howard (the movie's real star) and Joaquin Phoenix, who presumably agreed to do his second MNS movie in a row after seeing that he wouldn't be subjected to much of the flatter-than-Gwen-Stefani's-chest dialogue. As is often the case, the score from Shyamalan regular James Newton Howard also gives a lot more than it gets (apparently you need to be called Howard to come out positively in this movie); it pleased me that the credits gave the solo violinist Hilary Hahn prominent placing. The movie has one or two jolting moments to try and keep the viewers awake, but the moment of revelation only opens up plot holes bigger than the giant pit that comes into play at one point, and the abrupt ending caused some audience members to wonder if they'd missed something (they'd come in after the movie started, but only about five minutes after) - I did actually find myself going 'That was IT?!?' when 'AN M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN FILM' came up suddenly. (He always has to put himself above everyone else - whereas all the other opening credits here move towards the camera, his credit moves back. And that habit of giving himself pompous cameos has got to go; even the most fervent Steven Spielberg-hater must admit his ego isn't that big.)I liked 'Signs,' I didn't really hate what I saw of 'Unbreakable,' and Shyamalan's certainly got a good eye, but he could stand to stop thinking he's a genius if he can't deliver. Or let someone else either write or direct for a change.",Null,0,0,12 September 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," The first and second times were the charm.
","Third movies, eh? Not all of them are doomed to be letdowns; 'Escape from the Planet of the Apes' was the best of the series after the original, 'A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors' was the best of the sequels (and, probably not coincidentally, one of the few that Wes Craven had any creative input on), and for the ultimate example of there being exceptions to the rule, look no further than 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.' And then there's 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.'The first two 'Terminator' movies had James Cameron behind them; this one has Jonathan Mostow. Now there's nothing wrong with the boy Mostow  'Breakdown' proved he can pull off cracking thrillers, and he certainly delivers on the action front here, but the 'Terminator' series was always about more than knock-em-dead action. While he and writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris obey that manifesto here, it's in a different and not necessarily better way for two main reasons; one is that the focus of this movie is more on John Connor here than on John Connor and the Terminator. In the first movie the Terminator and Sarah Connor were equals (sorry, Kyle Reese fans); in the second movie saw them almost as a family unit. This time, it's more about the troubled and older John than the machines, which sounds good in a way, but it just helps add to the general grim, defeatist air throughout the movie. Given that this movie is essentially the 'Battle for the Planet of the Apes' of the series, bringing everything full circle, it couldn't really be any other way  but it would make the movie almost a deadening experience were it not for the reason most people choose to see this movie, i.e. the action scenes.Which brings us to reason numero two-o; the writers spend a lot of time playing riffs on the first two movies, with the big chase scene featuring the Terminator on a motorbike chasing a big rig commandeered by the evil Terminator that's chasing our human hero in a smaller vehicle especially amped up here (and with the nice addition of the evil Terminator remote-controlling several other cars to help out in pursuit), and it would work a lot better if it wasn't just a bigger, brawnier relative of a similar moment in 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day.' (And we don't get 'I'll be back'  but we do get 'She'll be back' and 'I'm back.') Arnold  no last name needed  is still fine when not required to act too much, and as T-X, the cutest cybernetic killing machine you ever did see, Kristanna Loken is effective and much easier on the eyes than Robert Patrick (though not quite as creepy); good effects help, but Marco Beltrami's score doesn't go with the mayhem as well as Brad Fiedel's did for the first two movies, even though it's more listenable away from the visuals than Fiedel's is. (The best track in the movie is Jerry Goldsmith's music for the C2 Pictures logo.)But Nick Stahl as John Connor is no match for Edward Furlong last time out, or the rest of the cast here; his performance underlines the movie's unbalanced priorities  when the obsolete Terminator and the super-advanced T-X face off, it's hard not to think this should be the real climax of the movie rather than the finale we actually get. 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' is the 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' of the series; some good ideas, nice fidelity to the rest of the series - especially in a moment when John realises that this Terminator isn't the same model that visited him in 1991 - and certainly not a bad movie, but ultimately something of a weak little sister. (And is it really asking so much for a movie in which Claire Danes isn't a misery magnet?)",Null,0,0,27 June 2004
Van Helsing," We want the finest vampire slayer known to humanity. And we want her here. And we want her now.
","One early scene in 'Van Helsing' plays like a cross between 'Men in Black' and the bit in James Bond movies when Q shows Bond his newest gadgets. Writer-director Stephen Sommers doesn't, however, include anything reminiscent of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer,' which is just as well - Buffy's run-in with Dracula was infinitely superior to this overblown, underpowered mess. Sommers chucks in Frankenstein's monster, werewolves, the Vatican, and endless rewritings of lore but forgets to make any of it interesting, starting with his characters.There's some kind of backstory about our fearless vampire killer, but it doesn't really build him up, and not only do we have a weak hero (played with a surprising lack of charisma by Hugh Jackman) but we also have a dull villain in Richard Roxburgh's Dracula; it's all one great big who-cares, a very hollow centre around which all the action revolves. Sommers certainly keeps the action coming, from a Paris showdown between Van Helsing and Mr. Hyde onwards - this whole movie plays like a piece of poorly done fan fiction (which in a way it is) - but without any emotional investment it's all for naught, and despite vampire attacks, all-out fights, and endless special effects it's pretty boring. And not only boring, but stupid (suspension of disbelief is one thing, but when six horses safely leap over a chasm while pulling a coach...).To make matters worse, it's done with a surprising lack of humour, Dracula's brides overact annoyingly (the loveliness of Josie Maran, Silvia Colluca and Elena Anaya notwithstanding) and there's something wrong when Van Helsing has more chemistry with Frankenstein's monster than with a dishy Transylvanian princess with a nice line in tight trousers and monster-killing. On the upside, Kevin J. O'Connor and Shuler Hensley are good as Igor and the monster, and Kate Beckinsale is lively when the script gives her the chance (and sexy even when the script doesn't); some of the FX from Industrial Light and Magic, Greg Cannom, Captive Audience, WETA Digital and the army of others are very good, and Alan Silvestri's score is too good for the movie it was written for.But when Van Helsing says 'I think we've overstayed our welcome,' it's hard to disagree.",Null,0,1,30 May 2004
Spider-Man," Action is his reward. Yours is the best superhero movie since 'Batman' (the Tim Burton one - sorry, but the 1966 one sucked).
","Warning: This features the odd spoiler.'Spider-Man,' as Peter Parker tells us at the start of the movie (and can I just say that, technically accurate though it may be, I hate the hyphen?), is basically a story about a girl. But that's not a reason to put people off (apart from the many people who think they're the only people in the world not to like this movie... and you aren't, okay? You aren't) - the Wall-Crawler was always more approachable than most of his breed, and the human element is one of the many reasons why Sam Raimi's movie is up there with the better examples of the genre ('X-Men,' the first Tim Burton 'Batman' movie, the first two 'Superman' movies); it hits the ground running and keeps going throughout the two hours, with such a fine mixture of love story, origins tale and action that I've now forgiven David Koepp for writing 'The Shadow' and 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park.'How-it-all-began movies can play like pilots, but this one never feels like television, which is a blessing given how Spiderman (hang the hyphen, this is MY review) hasn't come off too well on the small screen, especially in the live-action attempts (anyone remember 'The Electric Company'?). As played by the engaging Tobey Maguire, we're on Peter Parker's side from the moment we see the nerdy student getting mocked by his fellows; we feel his joy on discovering his superpowers (note that he never refers to his Spider-sense tingling); and we feel his sorrow when his uncle dies, a death he could have prevented.Though a chestnut-haired Kirsten Dunst doesn't look too much like Mary Jane Watson, she's charming and appealing even if she really doesn't have that much to do apart from be rescued and act as the love interest - much like Frances McDormand in Raimi's last (and also good) take on hero flicks, 'Darkman.'WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR SPOILERS...The resemblance doesn't end there; 'Spider-Man' and 'Darkman' both end with the hero knowing his beloved can return his love but choosing to live the life that fate ordained for him, over what his heart feels. Granted, 'Spider-Man''s ending isn't as all-out sad as 'Darkman''s (Frances McDormand frantically searching the streets of New York for Liam Neeson, who now has the face of Bruce Campbell), but it does leave the possibility of a reunion, and there's also a touch of ambiguity in that it leaves open the question of whether or not she knows his secret identity... in the climax Spidey calls her 'MJ,' even though she's never told him her name whenever they met while he was in webslinging mode. Very well acted, and very touching. (And I didn't mind the American flag either.)WE NOW RETURN TO OUR SPOILER-FREE SECTION, STILL IN PROGRESS.'Spider-Man' has flaws, of course, mainly its villain the Green Goblin and his altar ego (and father of Peter's best friend) Norman Osborn. He's not developed quite as well as his opponent, and as good as most of Willem Dafoe's performance is, some of his attempts at being a tortured soul are uncomfortably reminiscent of Jack Lord getting all emotional on 'Hawaii Five-O.' Then again, we've had the villain be infinitely more exciting than the hero far, far too many times. The effects from Sony Pictures Imageworks, Digiscope et al are uneven and sometimes unconvincing, and I'm not entirely sure about the Green Goblin's costume, but the human stuff always works (humorous and moving by turns), and since the webbing here looks like webbing and not rope (see the 1970s show), why gripe?The final faceoff between hero and villain is a bit underpowered, with the real action climax on a bridge coming just before the two go one-on-one - and it's certainly less striking than the movie's final scenes, but the cards have been laid out clearly by then; it's less about a superhero than about a man, and though it has plenty of action, escapes, rescues etc., that's how it should be. Your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man's finally made a successful leap out of the comics.Bonus points for J.K. Simmons (wonderful but underused as J. Jonah Jameson - never mind, there's always the sequel) and the cameos from Lucy Lawless, Ted Raimi, Bruce Campbell and Kirsten Dunst's rain-soaked breasts (extra treat #1); I wish that Columbia had taken a page from 'X-Men''s book and devoted the end credits to Danny Elfman's score instead of forgettable nu-metal, however. (Even there, they redeem themselves with the theme from the cartoon at the very end of the credits - the ORIGINAL one (extra treat #2), not the version from Aerosmith on the song album! All together now - 'Spiderman, Spiderman/Does whatever a spider can/Spins a web, any size/Catches thieves, just like flies/Look out, here comes the Spiderman...')",9,0,0,15 September 2002
The Butterfly Effect," 'The Simpsons' did something similar more than 10 times better in less than a tenth of the time.
","'The Butterfly Effect' seems more intent on showing that Ashton Kutcher has more in his arsenal than Kelso from 'That '70s Show,' Demi Moore, and MTV ripoffs of 'Candid Camera.' In that respect, writers-directors J. Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress succeed; as far as telling a compelling story goes, New Line Cinema has very definitely been punk'd, man!The concept's a fascinating one, and in the right hands this could have been an intriguing movie, but instead it just becomes an endless parade of grimness, with our hero's lifelong blackouts leading to full-out misery for himself and all around him, which gets worse for close to two hours when he finds he can harness his repressed memories to go back in time and try and sort things out. The movie sacrifices the potential of the subject in lieu of lining up every possible downer from kiddie porn to out-and-out murder... when our hero finds himself in prison, guess who gets hit on by a pair of Aryan psychos?In the midst of this tiresome spiral into Who Cares Land, there's a truly strong turn from a cast member more commonly found in silly comedies and usually considered as just a pretty face. And as well as Amy Smart proving she can do more than the likes of 'Road Trip' and 'Rat Race,' Ashton Kutcher's decent too. But their performances get lost in all the plot holes (through which he probably travels back in time, since there's no explanation offered in the movie) and in the endless misery... and ultimately there's really no point at all to it. Kutcher says it all at one point - 'What the f*** is THIS?!?'",Null,1,5,23 June 2004
Batman Begins," The best Batman ever... is still the cartoon. But this still beats nearly all the live-action versions.
","On the surface, there's nothing really wrong with 'Batman Begins' that replacing a sorely miscast Katie Holmes wouldn't cure (perhaps she's in the cast because they felt they had to have someone American there besides the excellent Morgan Freeman). It's very dark, very thoughtful and ideally cast almost from top to toe, with Christian Bale making a fine Bruce Wayne and Batman, Michael Caine giving the movie some genuine warmth as Alfred (and pretty much stealing the movie, along with Freeman's Lucius Fox), and it never treats the audience as anything less than adults.But what keeps me from exulting over this as much as many others is director Christopher Nolan's approach; his desire to keep it real - most reflected in the new Batmobile; goodbye stylish long gas-guzzler, hello compact all-terrain vehicle which, frankly, is quite ugly - makes 'Batman Begins' ultimately sacrifice excitement in favour of grittiness, and the movie pays for it in the third act. The first two-thirds are enough to make it better than all the other live-action Batman movies except Tim Burton's first effort, for sure - but the exploration into Bruce's psyche and what made him become the Caped Crusader, complete with training at the hands of a Ramirez-meets-Obi-wan Kenobi type played by Liam Neeson, comes at the expense of the villains (notably a terrific Cillian Murphy).While there's very creepy imagery, and the decision of Nolan and primary screenwriter David S. Goyer to not allow the villains to upstage the hero is a wise one, there's such a thing as space - 'Spider-Man 2' proved that you can develop the bad guys without sacrificing the hero, and that really needed to be done here. That, plus some very non-thrilling action moments, means that you're admiring the proceedings without getting truly pumped up. (And the less said about the disappointing score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard, the better.) This is still very much worth seeing, but the hands-off, clinical approach means the 1992 animated series is still the Dark Knight to beat.",7,3,4,29 June 2005
Meet the Fockers," Isn't this just a 'Carry On' movie with A-list talent? No, thankfully.
","'Meet the Parents' was probably the best of Robert DeNiro's numerous forays into the lighter side, though it's a long way away from the terrific 'Tribeca' TV series he executive produced. 'Meet the Fockers' is even further away - this is, in some senses, a crude comedy that wouldn't get much notice or be taken too seriously if its stars were all under the age of 30, but since none of them are, and since three of the four stars have Oscars to their name, it's a horse of a different colour. But like the slight but engaging original, this has more going for it than jokes about a male nurse called Gaylord Focker.The movie's pitting a relatively straightlaced couple (DeNiro and Gwynnie's mum) against a much more free-living pair (lawyer Dustin Hoffman and sex therapist Barbra Streisand) isn't the most original premise, and writers Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg and director Jay Roach occasionally... okay, not that occasionally... go for the cheap gag ('Honk if you're horny' indeed - and is that Erica Campbell as the driver of the bus, or just wishful thinking on my part?) - but the cast's enthusiastic playing is very hard to resist, with Hoffman a standout as the kind of dad who's so embarrassing most of us will relate in a second. Somehow if he, DeNiro and Barbra Streisand had been in the same movie in the 1970s it's hard to imagine it would be like this (especially since Streisand, never renowned for the smallness of her ego, is billed fourth!).Where the movie really scores isn't in jokes about the Fockers's dog humping the Byrnes's cat (!!!), but in the way it leavens the comedy with the subtext about trust, which is ultimately what the movie is really about. This may well strike some viewers as unnecessary schmaltz, but without it the movie wouldn't have anything at its heart. While the added dimension has its drawbacks (it does seem a bit too long), in the end 'Meet the Fockers' is more than a gross-out comedy for grownups; everyone looks as if they're having a good time, and ultimately so will many viewers, even if it does repeat some elements of the first one (but then, most sequels do). Ultimately, I liked it.",7,0,1,5 February 2005
The Little Mermaid," Wait a minute - there are actually people who HATE this?
","I was definitely no kid when I saw 'The Little Mermaid'; in fact, I was 20. I was thoroughly captivated by this movie - one of the last real delights from Disney's regular animation crews (before they had to get help from Pixar and Tim Burton) - and the Mouse couldn't have wished for a better movie to get them back on the proper road, animation-wise. (Of course, after this, 'Aladdin' and 'Beauty and the Beast' they've slipped a bit - though they're still better than DreamWorks.)Though not exactly loyal to the original story - Hans Christian Andersen was much more keen on unhappy endings - it's doubtful it would have worked as well if it had. The movie has just about everything going for it... lush animation, spirited musical numbers (this started Alan Menken's run of success for Disney, and he's surely had enough time to refresh himself by now, and for us all to forget 'Pocahontas'), wonderfully evil villain, likeable supporting players, and my all-time favourite Disney heroine, the endearing and lovely Ariel (remember the episode of 'Cheers' when Norm said he fancied her? She got a lot of real life guys' hearts - beat that, Princess Fiona from 'Shrek').And as a plus, the subsequent TV series (set before the movie) even managed to capture some of the spirit of the movie. But go for the original... a classic.",10,61,76,6 October 2002
X-Men: The Last Stand," Not X-cellent, but not X-ecrable either.
","There were those who were worried about 'X-Men: The Last Stand' when it was announced that Brett Ratner was directing; my worries came when I saw that the script was credited to Simon Kinberg ('Mr. & Mrs. Smith,' 'xXx: State of the Union') and Zak Penn ('Last Action Hero,' 'Elektra')... that this movie doesn't wind up as a bomb is a relief, therefore.That's not to say it doesn't have its flaws - some movies suffer from being too long, but with the amount of story strands in this one (Jean Grey's resurrection, Rogue's heartbreak, the discovery of a cure, and so on) the movie isn't long enough to deal with all of them satisfactorily; another half hour would have helped (the first two movies didn't have such a problem) and would have given this movie the scope it was crying out for - what should be as powerful as 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' or the final episode of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' is instead a bit undernourished, with lots of characters and not enough heft. It would also quite possibly have removed such jarring moments as an abrupt change from day to night in one crucial scene towards the end, but as this is a No Spoilers review I won't elaborate.As well as shortchanging Rebecca Romijn's Mystique and several other mutants, the movie also suffers from some weak performances (Josef Sommer is particularly bad as the US President) and a worrying tendency to be comic book in the worst way (case in point: every single scene with Vinnie 'Why the hell is he in this movie?' Jones's Juggernaut); Ratner might have been advised to take a tip from 'Prison Break' and let other people... say, Bryan Singer... direct while he took executive producer credit. (And yes, I realise Ratner did the first episode.) The main cast members are for the most part effective, both veterans (Stewart, McKellen, Jackman, Janssen, Paquin, Berry etc) and newcomers (Ellen Page, in addition to benefitting from the most convincing FX in the movie, is wonderful as Kitty); John Powell's terrific score is another plus, and even the general semi-dumbed-down approach can't hide the intelligence underneath the concept and the ambitious ideas. It still falls short of the first two films, yes, but there's still a big gap between 'X-Men: The Last Stand' and, say, 'Daredevil.' (And I thought I had figured out what the post-credits scene would be like... I was, happily, wrong.)",7,0,0,7 June 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," 'The battle for Helms Deep is over. The battle for Middle Earth is only beginning...'
","Two down, one to go.The middle part of a story is often the weakest - sort of an interim between the highs on either side (witness '24,' 'Murder One,' 'Twin Peaks' etc). 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' does qualify, but it's only inferior to 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' in the same way that drinking is inferior to imbibing.The previous movie had the principals more or less united, with the storyline similarly concentrated; this time, with the main characters all over Middle Earth, the movie's a bit episodic at times and is also guilty of making Gimli into something of a comic relief character (and as for him and Legolas boasting about how many people they kill...). But it gradually hooks you in the same way the last one did, and there are ultimately plenty of reasons for you to continue the journey.1. Ian McKellen; Bernard Hill; Viggo Mortensen; Christopher Lee; John Rhys-Davies; Sean Astin; Andy Serkis (unforgettable as Gollum); Elijah Wood; Miranda Otto; Liv Tyler (basically in an extended cameo, but Liv is always welcome)... basically everyone except Cate Blanchett. And even here she's blessedly kept to the absolute minimum.2. The building up of the characters, even the other two hobbits.3. Peter Jackson's Tim Burton-esque ability to bring to the screen some images that sound laughable when talking about them (ambulatory trees that can talk) and realise them with conviction.4. Stunning special effects and battle scenes that stir you both artistically and emotionally.5. Howard Shore's truly striking music.6. The fact that you end up wanting the movie to go on for another three hours.And come Christmas 2003, it will.",Null,0,0,30 December 2002
The Incredibles," 'Oh, come on! You gotta admit this is cool!'
","How worth it is 'The Incredibles'? Let's consider the evidence: 1. Writer-director Brad Bird has 'The Iron Giant' and 'The Simpsons' on his CV, making him ideal to oversee an animated movie that's very funny and very thoughtful, while also delivering messages without ramming them down your throat or otherwise talking down to the audience.2. This disproves the theory that animated movies of two hours' duration are exclusively a Japanese thing (the secret: all killer, no filler).3. 'The Incredibles' wears its influences well - the notion of superheroes having to hide their powers from a world that doesn't really appreciate them is very 'X-Men,' but it never plays as a ripoff. 'The Return of Captain Invincible' (also about a superhero coming out of retirement) also precedes this, but it doesn't handle its premise as well.4. The movie has a very 1960s look, but it's not interested in going the Austin Powers route and sending the whole thing up - the movie's got humour, but it plays its core situation and the character relationships very straight.5. As wonderful as 'Finding Nemo' was, its title character was a bit nondescript; here all the main characters are fleshed-out humans, from Mr. Incredible to super-speedy son Dash, and even the villain.6. The movie has action to spare, but it's the little twists thrown in that make it work (it's heartbreaking when Violet tries to activate her forcefield at a crucial time and can't).7. 'Alias' composer Michael Giacchino's excellent score deserves an Oscar nomination at the very least. (Walt Disney Feature Animation and DreamWorks please note the lack of songs.)8. The voice work.9. Elastigirl - the real leader of the family, and the most attractive animated crime fighter this side of Kim Possible.10. 'When everyone's super, no one will be,' the arch villain pronounces. And 'The Incredibles' proves that we need the 'Shark Tale's and 'Home On The Range's of this world - just as the movie itself shows that we need special people to stand out from the mass but also need people who AREN'T superheroes, we need the dross to truly appreciate the gems.This movie stands proud with the other Pixar movies, and also alongside recent non-animated superhero movies. It truly lives up to its name.",9,3,6,30 December 2004
Driven," Where's that Speed Racer when you need him?
","'What am I, a piece of wood?' 'Who cares?' 'You should talk less and drive more.' 'This is horrible.' 'It doesn't mean anything.' 'Unbelievable.' 'Will it hold together?' 'Not for long.'All the above are actual lines from Sylvester Stallone's screenplay for 'Driven,' as if he was predicting the reception this spiritless racing film would get. To be fair, I hate sports and I fail to see what's so exciting about Formula One, Le Mans or C.A.R.T. (the milieu for Renny Harlin's latest opus) - but I still could and should have gotten some sort of thrill from the race scenes.Instead you have a mass of clichéd characters and poor acting (Burt Reynolds proves that he can actually sink even lower than shilling for British opticians), though since they have to spout dialogue that reminds you why Stallone hasn't had a writing credit since 'Cliffhanger' (the last time he got together with Harlin) you can see why they have a hard time with it. Surprisingly, the best actors in this film are the non-professional ones - but some would say there's something seriously wrong with any film where Victoria's Secret/Sports Illustrated stunner Estella Warren and the ESPN announcers give the best performances (just one more reason why I'm looking forward to the 'Planet of the Apes' remake).But that would not be taking into account the bad editing and the ambitious but dreadful digital effects, not to mention the soundtrack (which is as horrible as Estella is gorgeous, and that's pretty damn horrible). It's so sterile it's amazing - even when a driver has a spectacular crash it only seems to have been put in for effect... and not to give away the ending, but don't the three fastest finishers in a race usually ascend the podiums in REVERSE order? (And why do the trucks for the scenes in Germany have 'German Grand Prix' written on them in English?)Returning to the subject of hidden messages, the song credits include one called 'Take Me Away From Here.' Amen - but the last line of the film ('It doesn't last long.') has to be a mistake, given that it takes two long hours to tell and runs out of gas before the end of the first lap. You'll get more entertainment from any episode of 'Speed Racer' or 'Wacky Races' (come to think of it, Estella would make a pretty good Penelope Pitstop). Heck, even 'Cannonball Run II' is better than this. And that's a sentence I hope I never have to write again.",Null,6,12,18 July 2001
Men in Black II," You won't need a strobe light to wipe this from your memory.
","At the beginning of 'Men In Black II,' the light of the Columbia logo's Statue of Liberty flashes a la the MIB's neuralizing device, in an attempt to wipe the audience's memory of the previous movie and thus deliver an excuse for the pale imitation that follows; it's shorter than the first one - even with the extensive end credits (which clock in at 7:05 - yes, I timed them), it comes in at around 84 minutes - and the duration isn't the only way it's lesser.The thrill and freshness are gone in this belated sequel about another threat to the future of the Earth arriving in pursuit of something that's hidden here, and only the Men In Black can stop it/her... but when the villain takes the form of a Victoria's Secret model and it still isn't stirring, there's something wrong. (Admittedly after 'Wild Wild West' I can understand Barry Sonnenfeld bypassing actual models like Frederique van der Wal in favour of proper actresses like Lara Flynn Boyle, but it might have benefitted the movie to see Heidi Klum with tentacles or Laetitia Casta in lingerie... actually, almost anything would benefit from the latter. But I digress.) In fact, the movie doesn't get going until Will Smith tracks down Tommy Lee Jones and brings him back into the field; Jones's underplaying is worth any amount of Smith's mugging, but he's one of the few positive aspects.Blame the true villains - Robert Gordon (who co-wrote 'Galaxy Quest,' which is in his favour) and Barry Fanaro (who used to write for 'The Golden Girls,' which isn't). The threadbare and illogical script doesn't have much for anyone to work with, and the setpieces just seem to lie there from the opening with a subway worm-creature onwards - the latter not helped by some weak effects-work. And unlike 'Addams Family Values,' this doesn't add anything of its own to the mix - from the Xerox of the 'Smaller-than-it-looks' title sequence to the you-need-a-sense-of-proportion ending that completely lacks the sense of existentialism the first one had, it's the prototype for lazy sequels. Basically, there's nothing here that hasn't been seen before, with the exceptions of Lara Flynn Boyle walking around with an enormous stomach and Tommy Lee Jones in postman's shorts.Frank the pug, the worms, Tony Shalhoub and a wasted Rosario Dawson are great, however, and you should definitely sit through the end credits (not for Will Smith's obligatory rap - 'The best looking crimefighter since myself in Part 1'? You wish - but for Danny Elfman's swinging music). But apart from that, stick with the original movie or the far superior animated TV series.",Null,0,1,16 March 2003
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," This movie melts in your mouth, not in your hand.
","I like chocolate. I like Tim Burton movies. I like the original Roald Dahl book (and its sequel). I even liked 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,' but not as much as a lot of others - though still more than Dahl did (he loathed it as much as he liked chocolate). And I like Danny Elfman. 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,' therefore, is a treat for fans of all of the above.Burton and screenwriter John August improve not only on their own 'Big Fish' but also on the previous movie in a number of ways, and not only in terms of effects (with a gap of 34 years it stands to reason that Violet Beauregarde's transformation into a blueberry would beat the original, helped by Annasophia Robb's excellent turn as a superhumanly self-confident little gum-chewer). The movie's addition of a backstory for chocolatier par excellence Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp, turning into another marvellous turn for the master) - like 'Sleepy Hollow,' he's given a less than happy young life, though at least his dentist dad Christopher Lee doesn't kill his mum with an iron maiden - can seem like an unnecessary addition which weighs the story down and serves as an excuse for a happy family ending (which is a bit strange, given that Dahl's book had one anyway), but it doesn't really harm the finished result, and in fairness you can understand the desire to give Wonka something to do. Something apart from be the unquestioned star of the movie, that is.Wonka's edge is less prominent here than in Gene 'I was the best Wonka, dammit' Wilder's performance, but it's here all the same; and if the movie does stack the odds in favour of Charlie Bucket (and that's putting it mildly), so did the book. In any case, Freddie Highmore is so appealing as Charlie that you're rooting for him anyway, and the other child actors are fine as well for the most (oddly, the girls do better than the boys overall - I believe this is called 'Friends Stars In Movies Syndrome').The movie is as much a treat for the eyes as the heart, with the chocolate factory seeming like the greatest theme park there ever was and some of the best effects work in a Burton movie (kudos to Cinesite and the Magic Camera Company); Elfman contributes one of his tenderest works for Burton to date, and his songs for the Oompa-Loompas (with Dahl's lyrics from the book) are all without exception highlights.At the risk of sounding like one of those film critics whose quotes have 'A+' and exclamation marks a go-go, I can't really deliver a measured examination of this movie - just go and see it. In spite of its pro-chocolate agenda, it's better for kids than 'Madagascar' and its ilk. And it won't make you feel sick afterwards if you're diabetic. (Believe me, I know.)",8,4,6,14 August 2005
Big Fish," 'So it's a tall tale?' 'Well, it's not a short one...'
","In an episode of 'Tiny Toon Adventures' where the students of Acme Looniversity are showing the movies they made in film class, everyone expects Gogo Dodo's entry to be full-on wackiness - instead it's a (relatively) restrained live-action tale about two people dancing (actually a drastically edited-down version of one of the Joe McDoakes short subjects, 'So You Want To Learn To Dance'); when Babs complains, Gogo argues that he can't be expected to stay to type all the time.This, I think, is what's behind general critical response in the UK to 'Big Fish' - there's no acid here, no full-on weirdness, no dark, edgy atmosphere... it's more sentimental than most of Tim Burton's other movies, but does that make it bad? Or does that make it his most personal movie since 'Edward Scissorhands,' and certainly a return to form after his sojourn to the 'Planet of the Apes'? I'll go for the latter; he's always shown some warmth in his best work when you think about it - it's just that this time it's for 'normal' people. You could almost say that it's his lightest movie since 'Pee-wee's Big Adventure' (another movie about an odyssey and the people the hero meets on the way).The movie's part a father-son drama and part the 'Forrest Gump'-ish odyssey of a man through life, as told by the older man (Albert Finney) to those around him; everyone loves his stories except his serious-minded son (Billy Crudup), who's never really gotten over his dad's tendency to prefer a good yarn to the truth. But he's not so estranged that he doesn't come home from Paris with his wife to be by his ill father's side; for a lot of the movie John August's adaptation of Daniel Wallace's book can't quite find a satisfactory balance between the relationship between father and son and the tales the former tells about his life, which may or may not be total lies (it's not until near the end of the movie that we [sort of] find out for sure), but that's okay because Finney's story is so involving we wind up caring about him and the bond with his son anyway.Burton's empathy with the strange (a giant, a circus owner with a secret, a mysterious little town) is coupled with his gift to make the bizarre seem everyday, plus Ewan McGregor's performance - his shifting accent notwithstanding - to make this journey fun and touching, even if it does seem almost as fragmented as 'Catch Me If You Can' (though the usual Tim Burton 'Story? What story?' approach is reined in for once). It must be said that it's not as emotional as the wonderful 'Forrest Gump' was (hang cool, detached irony, I LOVE that movie), and Helena Bonham Carter manages to overact in one of her two roles - the one which doesn't require any dialogue, oddly enough - but like the characters in the movie, you could go on the journeys the man describes forever.'Big Fish' has a fine supporting cast (Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Danny DeVito, Robert Guillaume, the marvellous Steve Buscemi, the Tai twins...), striking images, and another wonderful Danny Elfman score - Elfman's finale music combines with what comprises said finale to make it a super finish to the tale - but ultimately the story is what makes this movie. Whether or not you see the movie as one big tall tale, by the end we truly see the man as a big fish - one in a big pond; it's a movie about being an individual that doesn't go out of its way to damn everyone for not being as wonderful. It won't work for the shoegazers of the world, but that wasn't Burton's aim here.",Null,0,0,3 May 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," 'An Anonymous Content Production'? Not in this world.
","'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is one of those movies that signifies its strangeness by having the opening credits come quite a way into the movie (a la 'Alias'). If nothing else, it lives up to the mindset it promises, although I have to admit I don't love this movie as much as others do; director Michel Gondry and writer Charlie Kaufman have certainly delivered a clever and touching tale... but it's a bit too much of the former and a bit short on the latter.The movie's biggest problem is that Jim Carrey (cast against type as an introverted nice guy) and Kate Winslet (as a woman who we know is a free spirit - though a troubled one - because she keeps changing her hair colour) don't really seem like they are or ever were a couple, even allowing for opposites attracting. This doesn't ruin the movie's effect, but it does make it seem a bit remote, especially as their relationship is seen almost entirely from his point of view. Remember, there are two sides to every story, and although we do eventually see her side of it, the real added dimension comes from Kirsten Dunst as the receptionist at the company that performs the mind-wiping that triggers the plot. She seems surplus to requirements at first, but it turns out that she's there to do more than dance on a bed in a T-shirt and panties.This is one of the movie's main strengths (not Kirsten Dunst in a T-shirt and panties*); everything proves to have something else going on under the surface, including the structure of the movie itself. The constant unpredictability and the conviction of Carrey's performance as the man on an adventure inside his own mind makes it more than the exercise in cleverness for cleverness's sake that it could have been - the movie never forgets that it's a romance at heart. Jon Brion's wonderful score (which is almost another character in the movie) is another plus; so is Tom Wilkinson as the doctor in charge, and so are Dunst, Winslet, Mark Ruffalo and even Elijah Wood.But though funny, ingenious and even a little touching, in the end 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is a feelgood movie for people who like to think they're too smart to be caught at feelgood movies; I like it, certainly, but I can't help wondering if this is one of those movies that viewers of a certain kind SAY you should love, rather than something you can take to your hearts of your own accord. Either way, it deserves a second viewing, and there aren't many Jim Carrey that even merit one.*Which is not to say that's a bad thing, mind.",Null,4,9,8 May 2004
The Mummy Returns," Stephen Sommers isn't Steven Spielberg, but at least he isn't Jan deBont.
","Jan deBont started out great, directing-wise, with 'Speed,' and he hasn't made a decent movie since. Stephen Sommers hasn't reached the heights of 'Speed,' but he hasn't plumbed the depths of 'Speed 2: Cruise Control' either - he makes big dumb movies, for sure, but at least he makes entertaining big dumb movies. Think of him as the American equivalent of Roland Emmerich if Emmerich hadn't shot his bolt after 'Independence Day' ('Deep Rising' is everything 'Godzilla' should have been).'The Mummy Returns,' the silly but fun sequel to the silly but fun 'The Mummy,' actually improves on the original in a few aspects, most notably in that Rachel Weisz's Evy has a bit more dimension to her this time with the clumsiness that was a running gag in the first movie passed on as an afterthought to her and Rick's (Brendan Fraser) son; but the story of our heroes having to prevent the unearthed Mummy and his reincarnated love (the fetching Patricia Valezquez) from killing the Scorpion King and using his army to take over the world, all the while racing to keep their son from dying himself, is more than a little flawed in its scripting - where did the new Anck-su-Namun come from, for instance? - and some moments leave a bad taste in the mouth (are we really supposed to laugh at the scene where a hapless underling gets killed by a pygmy and John Hannah's character says 'Sorry!'?).Our heroes' son (played by Spencer Treat Clark, who I honestly thought was a girl in 'Gladiator' and didn't impress me here either) is another drawback, with attempts to weld his mother's Britishness and his father's wiseacre nature never quite working; and the special effects are uneven, varying from horribly obvious (like the opening battle and the raising of the dead army in the climax) to quite good (like the pygmies and the abyss) - since five effects companies are listed, it's unlikely that Industrial Light and Magic are to blame for all the flaws (and they are definitely credited for the pygmy work). But the movie benefits from action to spare, from its spirited cast (even the Rock in his - let's be honest - cameo as the Scorpion King), and also from Alan Silvestri's excellent score. (A big order of the carnivorous bugs that eat at least one member of the cast should, however, go to whoever put that ghastly song 'Forever May Not Be Long Enough' over the end credits - the most obvious tack-on pop number since Bryan Adams, Rod Stewart and Sting got together for the tune at the end of the '93 version of 'The Three Musketeers.') Mentally stimulating it's not, but it's not boring by any stretch of the imagination. And when will you ever see another film with a credit for 'Mountain Of Flesh'?",7,1,1,5 July 2002
National Treasure," No buried treasure here.
","If ever a movie from Walt Disney Pictures looked as if it should have come from Touchstone but turned out to be a Disney movie in the worst sense, 'National Treasure' is that movie. Yes, it has the Jerry Bruckheimer stamp; yes, there are few if any children in it; yes, it has Harvey Keitel; and yes, it has some inviting shots of Diane Kruger's cleavage; but this is ultimately a pretty soft and toothless adventure tale, dressed up with major names and slick production values.The first movie from Nicolas Cage's production company Saturn Films to star the man since 'The Family Man' (he wasn't in 'The Life Of David Gale'), the movie suffers from a) Cage not seeming to take this seriously for a moment, b) Diane Kruger confirming that her chronic blandness in 'Troy' was no fluke, c) Jon Turteltaub being just as good with action here as he was with '3 Ninjas' (i.e. not very) and additionally forgetting that he's dealing with adults this time around, d) an unforgivably sluggish pace for what's supposed to be an exciting race around the Northeast US to find the treasure of the Knights Templar, e) a script by Jim Kouf (woo-hoo!) and the team of Marianne Wibberley and Cormac Wibberley (d'oh!) that lets the absurdities pile up unceasingly, a drawback made even more glaring by d), f) a lot of absolutely dreadful dialogue (alternately ridiculously expository and trying to be witty and failing), and g) a generally neutered feel to the whole enterprise; it sometimes plays like a history lesson in lieu of a proper movie. The Indiana Jones movies are still the template for this kind of thing... and we don't even get to see Nicolas Cage freak out.Jon Voight really, really needs to change his agent.",4,0,2,8 January 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," The words 'preaching' and 'converted' come to mind.
","It's highly unlikely that the Wachowski Brothers will be reading this or even take on board ANY criticism of their inexplicably adored load of self-important nonsense... er, their trilogy of movies about the Matrix; so rather than make any attempt at writing about how cold and boring 'The Matrix Reloaded' was, I'll just furnish a short list of ways this movie and 'The Matrix Revolutions' can be redeemed.1. Remove the heads of Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski from their own backsides, using force if necessary.2. Cut down on the use of slow-motion; not only would it cut down on the overuse of such a device, but it would make the movie a lot shorter.3. Invest in acting lessons for the cast.4. Put in more moments like Trinity asking for a crash-course on stealing a motorcycle to be downloaded, only for the Keymaker to make a key for the bike on the spot. This is known as 'humour,' something of which a bit more would not go amiss.5. Stop putting insufferably pompous and heavy-handed dialogue into nearly everyone's mouth. Especially Laurence Fishburne's.6. Endless Agent Smiths stops being impressive with overuse. Please bear that in mind.7. Complex action scenes don't work when we don't care about the characters, which is why the massive freeway chase doesn't come off.8. The movie is absolutely wonderful when Monica Bellucci is on screen (her beauty and body are the movie's most amazing special effects; admitteldy she isn't too comfortable in this milieu, but how would you like it if English wasn't your first language and you had to speak it here - with a French accent yet?). Unfortunately in 'The Matrix Reloaded' there are 128 minutes where such is not the case. 9. Do not make the first hour or so such a tedious talk-fest.
10. There is no need for several endings when only one will suffice.11. Don't assume everyone in the world lives and breathes 'The Matrix.' The movie suffers from being too wrapped up in itself for all but the most devoted of fans to get the full effect; there are enough of them for AOL Time Warner to make their money back, but the original movie wasn't as brilliant as it thought it was, and this one is even less. Instead of being the extension of an impressive movie, 'The Matrix Reloaded' is little more than a return to 'Chain Reaction' territory for Keanu Reeves.Maybe endless clones of Monica Bellucci would have helped...",Null,0,1,5 July 2003
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Pitt? Jolie? Brody makes this movie for me.
","Wacky and thrilling premise (husband and wife discover they're rival assassins), helmed by Doug Liman and starring two of Hollywood's Sexiest Stars... how could it fail? At the box office, not really. Artistically, not so hard. The trouble with 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' is that what is supposed to be a romantic action comedy is lacking in the romance (in part because Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie don't really connect on screen - Pitt is in dull mode throughout, and I've never been a member of the Jolie Barmy Army; anyone of the female cast from 'Sin City' wipes the floor with her), not entirely successful with the action - only in the third act is there any kind of adrenaline, and even then not much - and absolutely DOA with the comedy. 'The War of the Roses' took the husband-and-wife-trying-to-kill-each-other premise and did a far better, edgier and funnier job.To be fair, the movie was cursed from the beginning by being produced by Akiva Goldsman - and know this: unless the least deserving Oscar-winner in recent memory makes a movie with someone I really, really like, this is absolutely the last movie I will see with his name on it (after 'Constantine' - which I admit I couldn't get through - 'Starsky & Hutch,' 'Deep Blue Sea,' 'Lost in Space,' 'A Time to Kill,' 'Batman Forever' and 'Practical Magic' enough is enough) - and written by the man who wrote 'xXx2: The Next Level.' What saved the show for me was the performance of Adam Brody as a spy who proves to be the key to the whole business; he isn't on screen long, but he always delivers the goods when he is. But otherwise, as Summer Roberts would say - 'Ew.'",4,0,2,19 June 2005
War of the Worlds," A long way from Roy Neary and Elliott in every sense of the term.
","'War of the Worlds' is almost enough to make you - or me, anyway - wish that Steven Spielberg only ever did science fiction movies. I say almost because if that were the case, we wouldn't have 'Amistad' (one of his most underrated works), 'Saving Private Ryan,' 'Catch Me If You Can,' 'The Color Purple,' 'Duel,' 'Schindler's List,' or his upcoming movie about the Munich Olympics massacre. The man has many gifts, even if comedy isn't necessarily one of them.Though this movie is pretty much on a big scale, it still seems surprisingly intimate (or as intimate as a movie where large tripods from outer space vaporize hundreds of people can be). This is because Spielberg and adaptors John Friedman and David Koepp never change the movie's point of view from that of dockworker Tom Cruise and his daughter Dakota Fanning as they go on their journey to try and escape the Martians (they do have another relative along, but he's taken out of the movie for a while before the third act - since Justin Chatwin's performance isn't on a level with Cruise's or especially Fanning's, this is just as well).The result is that other than Tim Robbins's survivalist, none of the people they encounter en route get much time to make an impression, but that only adds to the feel of the movie, and makes it seem more like the true anti-'Independence Day' that some claimed 'Mars Attacks!' was. No alien-human dogfights here; most of the attacks are futile, and a number of scenes that have 'major setpiece' written all over them either take place offscreen - we don't see the invaders bring down a passenger plane, but only the aftermath - or are almost in the background; this has its most effective payoff in one scene where Cruise is forced to take action against the more extreme Robbins, with us experiencing it from Fanning's perspective (she doesn't actually see it, and neither do we) and only John Williams' striking (and extremely non-hummable - no five-note alien messages or soaring flying-by-the-moon melodies here) score to give us an idea of what's happening.It may not be as exhilarating as 'Independence Day,' and certainly not as heavy on the humour (though there is some - when Cruise tells his daughter to order out for dinner and finds she's sent out for hummus, he reasonably points out 'I meant food'), but it genuinely brings over the horror of how a normal day can suddenly turn into a fight for survival. It may not be 'the terrorists,' as Fanning asks when the attacks begin, but it could well have been, so it works as something to bring on thought and as an exercise in thrills (one sequence with Cruise, Fanning and Robbins in a basement with one of the aliens' sensors seeking them out is particularly tense). Some have complained about the ending, but emotionally it's pretty much on a par with what's come before - even the tide-turning isn't all that excessive. 'War of the Worlds' isn't Spielberg's best movie, but it's a return to form after 'The Terminal.' And Robbins' character is right; this isn't a war. It's an extermination.",8,1,2,29 July 2005
Wedding Crashers," You know, I can't stand weddings.
","'Wedding Crashers' is pretty obviously aimed at the 'Meet the Parents/Fockers' crowd, and it certainly is just as forgettable as those two movies. It's also a lot longer, and much less pleasant - listening to other audience members laughing made me feel like Homer Simpson post-crayon-removal and watching 'Love Is Nice' ('That's Bill PULLMAN, you fool!'); in an even closer analogy, one scene in David Dobkin's movie has wedding maid Rachel McAdams trying to keep a straight face while listening to her sister's wedding vows and almost succeeding. I had considerably less difficulty keeping a straight face throughout most of this movie's (over)length.In fairness to Miss McAdams and the cast in general, it's not their fault I didn't warm to it the way a lot of others have; the performances throughout are a lot better than the material deserves, with Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson often just seeming to be improvising or delivering standup routines (which is strange given that they aren't comedians). The trouble is, nothing throughout the movie rings emotionally true the way it did in 'Meet the Parents' or the sequel; the family our mediators/crashers slip into is chock full of screwball-wannabe stereotypes rather than people - mother Jane Seymour and daughter Isla Fisher score the highest in this field (watching the latter come into Vaughn's bedroom and rape him is a low point for the movie; imagine if it was the other way around... and equations to Jodie Foster in 'The Accused' have no business being in comedies) - and because it's so phony throughout it completely fails to earn its soothing moments near the end.That it's almost never funny doesn't help; it's always nice to see Rebecca DeMornay, and uncredited Will Ferrell singlehandedly raises my rating to 4 out of 10 (only when he's on screen does it qualify as a comedy), but 'Wedding Crashers' is ultimately proof that it's not only overproduced blockbusters that can leave you empty inside. Sadly, its box office take suggests that New Line Cinema can think of plenty of reasons why we might get a sequel; if only we could have forever held our peace at the kiosk.",4,2,4,31 July 2005
Ice Age," The settings are cold, but the movie isn't.
","Twentieth Century Fox hasn't had the best of luck with animated movies -'FernGully: The Last Rainforest' is best forgotten, 'The Pagemaster' was patchy, 'Anastacia' wasn't bad but was unmemorable, and 'Titan A.E.' was a misfire (in addition to helping shut down Fox Animation Studios). 'Ice Age' finally delivers the goods through Blue Sky.This is well animated than Walt Disney Pictures's own prehistoric trek 'Dinosaur' but a better movie all told, because it has characters on its side - a sloth and mammoth trailing behind in the annual migration to get away from the winter discover a human baby (given to them by his mother, who dies in escaping a tiger attack) and take it on themselves to return the child to his people before the snow sets in and closes the only route available. If dave-hart is reading this, the reason they're joined by a sabretooth tiger called Diego is that he's been sent by the leader of his group to get the baby from Sid the sloth and Manfred the mammoth ('I see - can't have kids of your own, so you want to adopt') and bring him back, so that his revenge can be complete; the tigers attacked the humans because the baby's father hunted the tigers. As Mrs Loman put it, 'Attention must be paid.'The storyline won't win any awards for originality, but the movie has plenty of points of interest (the mute human characters - 'You know humans can't talk!' - in accordance with the true first settlers of America, have distinctly Native American looks), and enough humour and genuine appeal to win over most viewers; the flock of survivalist dodos preparing for the imminent Ice Age are my favourites among the subsidary characters, but the three main characters all get to share the spotlight. As the one who's the most nebbishy, Sid could have been truly annoying, but he stays the right side of amusing throughout (kudos to the writers and John Leguizamo); Manfred is good enough to suggest another look at 'Everybody Loves Raymond' may be in order, and as for Denis Leary as Diego... well, when is he NOT worth the time?It is a bit predictable, and it's not Pixar admittedly, but it's not as self-satisfied as DreamWorks either; it's just a movie. But it's a good one - entertaining from the running joke of Scrat and his nut to the final scene. 'Ice Age' is the best prehistoric cartoon since 'The First Bad Man,' though not quite up to Tex Avery level... but then again, what is?And please note the absence of dinosaurs (and singing). Already this is more accurate than some live-action movies.",Null,1,1,30 March 2003
Bring It On," We're happy, we're clappy, we don't think this is...
","At one point in 'Bring It On,' cheerleader captain Kirsten Dunst plays a tape made by her love interest and dances like crazy on her bed; directly above said bed is a poster of Nancy Kerrigan, the figure skater best known for being the victim of underhanded methods by her rival Tonya Harding's boyfriend in a bid to keep her out of a competition. Since the plot of the movie also involves unfair tactics, it's clear that it's not as silly as it looks on the surface.Okay, it is possible to enjoy the movie purely for its obvious pleasures, but Jessica Bendinger's screenplay (though not exactly 'Lucas' or 'The Chocolate War') does have some points to make about the extent people are willing to go to win, whether legally or illegally; there's also a welcome undertone of liberality (the cheerleader squads include guys, but it's the footballers that receive most of the ridicule - one of the best bits about the movie is when the school football team arrives to much less of a welcome than the pep squad). The film also takes an interesting attitude towards the Toros (the squad who's won the national championships for the past five years) and the Clovers (the team who are to all intents and purposes the underdogs); though the former Toros team captain (Clare 'Glory from 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' Kramer) has been swiping the Clovers' routines for years, 'Bring It On' both resists the temptation to stack everything in favour of the Clovers and has the Toros be caught in another (unintentional) duplication of someone else's routine at the tryouts; some more screen time given to the Clovers in general and their captain (Gabrielle Union) in particular would have helped the movie even more, since the relationship that develops between the two captains is underdeveloped on film.Some of the routines done in the contest climax seem a bit too complex, and you do have to wonder about a few of the plot points, but overall the movie's an above-average teen pic that's performed with enthusiasm (especially by the leads, although Eliza Dushku is the real star of the movie) and has one of the less objectionable song soundtracks of its breed. 'Bring It On' can be accused of taking what many understandably don't consider a sport too seriously, but look at how many bad movies have been made out of 'real' sports - this is no 'Hoosiers' or 'The Bad News Bears,' but it's also no 'Wind' (the unspeakably boring America's Cup movie) or 'Split Decisions' (about boxing). Better cheerleading than golf, I say - and as a commentator says during the movie, 'Any sport that combines gymnastics, dance and short skirts is okay by me.'Just one query: Why is there a visual effects supervisor credited? The Misses Dunst, Dushku, Union and Lindsay Sloane do that job perfectly well, thank you very much (particularly in the carwash scene and the 'Puttin' On The Hits'-type sequence over the credits).'I'm sexy, I'm cute/I'm popular to boot...'",7,0,0,16 July 2002
The Terminal," I don't know when I'll be back again...
","Steven Spielberg has never made a bad movie (and yes, that does include '1941'), but he has produced one or two - 'Joe Versus The Volcano,' which was one of the first times he and Tom Hanks appeared on the same credit roll. 'The Terminal,' along with being a change of pace from 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Band of Brothers,' proves that they've come a long way from that leaden comedy and 'The Money Pit' - but it's not a highpoint for either.I'm not saying this is a loser; admittedly this movie does suffer from an inability to decide whether it wants to be a comedy or a drama - the scenes of Tom Hanks' Krakhosian traveler viewing civil unrest in his country on the airport's TV screens sit uneasily with his gathering luggage carts for cashback, for a start. Plus the situation he's in is treated quite seriously, notably with the official who's the closest 'The Terminal' has to an actual villain - played by Stanley Tucci, in the movie's best performance as an official who's a nice guy one moment and determined to get Hanks out of the airport at whatever cost the next.This inability to find a proper tone is partly Spielberg's fault - he seems afraid of being accused of being too sentimental this time around, although if ever a storyline could have done with more emotional pull (not so much in the relationship between Hanks and flight attendant Catherine Zeta Jones* as with the reason why he's in America in the first place) this is it - but screenwriters Sacha Gervasi and Jeff Nathanson deserve more of the blame, especially the latter (whose questionable storytelling abilities also hobbled 'Speed 2: Cruise Control,' 'Rush Hour 2' and to an admittedly lesser extent 'Catch Me If You Can'). A distressing amount of subplots never seem to have a proper buildup or payoff (like the catering guy in love with Zoe Saldana), and a lot of it is too fragmented to have an impact; the climax and finale just don't have the effect they should.The shame of it is that this movie is often perfectly watchable - finely acted, amusing and touching, and well shot and scored by Janusz Kaminski and John Williams respectively (not to give anything away, but music plays a key role in the movie). DreamWorks built an entire airport lounge for the movie (most of which was shot in Montreal rather than New York), but the good news about 'The Terminal' is that it's not the sort of movie where you leave whistling the scenery. The bad news about it, though, is that you don't leave with much about it on your mind - worth seeing, but nothing about it lingers the way, say, Jennifer Garner playing Go Fish with Leonardo DiCaprio in 'Catch Me If You Can' does. This would make a great inflight movie.*And the end credits finally prove that there IS no hyphen in her name.",7,1,2,25 November 2004
The Iron Giant," Warner Bros' priorities leave something to be desired...
","That features like this and 'Cats Don't Dance' should be treated so poorly by Warner Bros (in the case of the latter it wasn't even released to UK cinemas) while 'Space Jam' and 'The Quest for Camelot' had the red carpet rolled out beggars belief. But I can understand why it had difficulty being sold; here's an animated feature without any song-and-dance numbers (all the songs are '50s numbers heard on radios or TVs), no merchandisably cute characters, nothing to mark it out as a traditional 'kids' movie, and no trademarks like Disney has. They clearly think Western moviegoers aren't ready to sit through non-Disney-wannabes, and given that it flopped both in America and here they may be right (although if only the marketers had a clue...). This film is quality almost from beginning to end (the first few minutes were a bit weak setting up the story, but it soon finds its feet), although it may be a bit too sophisticated for the viewer who can't move beyond 'The Flintstones' or 'My Little Pony,' and it definitely can't be accused of patronizing its audience. Genuinely moving, sometimes very funny and always involving, highly recommended.",Null,0,1,18 June 2000
Shrek," A good movie, but three words - 'Fractured Fairy Tales.'
","For those of you who don't know, 'Fractured Fairy Tales' was a section of the classic 'Rocky and Bullwinkle' show which, much like 'Shrek,' turned classic folklore on its head but did so with a bit more genuine irreverence. Jay Ward and Co also didn't need 90 minutes of expensive animation to do it either.That's not to say I hated it - I'm all for doing it as well as possible, and 'Shrek' sports top-of-the-line animation and design throughout without any Disney-type modelling on real people (though a key character does look like Tara from 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer'). The script also sports plenty of good ideas and gags about both traditional fairy tales (witness Lord Farquhad's interrogation of the gingerbread man) and modern day culture (including the best reference to 'The Matrix' ever), the voices are right, particularly Eddie Murphy's donkey (even if it is a retread of his scene-stealing dragon from 'Mulan') - although after 'So I Married An Axe Murderer,' 'Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me' and this, I wish Mike Myers would sort out his obsession with Scottish accents - and all the ingredients are in place, but somehow the movie falls short of its goals... not to mention DreamWorks' own 'The Prince Of Egypt.'It might be because some thoughtless person wrote a letter to 'Entertainment Weekly' which gave away the ending (which I will not do). It might be due to far too many tasteless jokes. It might be because the film tries to have its cake and eat it (and not only in said ending; Shrek may be bothered about his looks but that doesn't stop him making jokes about the villain's short stature). Or it could just be that, like PDI/DreamWorks's 'Antz,' it's only slightly less clever than it thinks it is, though it happily lacks that film's characterisation flaws.Perhaps the jabs at Disney weren't malicious, but the makers should've copied the Mouse with regards to songs - there are far too many pop songs throughout, including one over the end credits that has 'Future Oscar Night Performance' written all over it, and they cheapen the film as a whole (especially considering that it already has a wonderful score by Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell, of which only one cue is on the soundtrack album). I'd have to say that 'The Princess Bride' and 'The 10th Kingdom' mine similar territory to better effect than 'Shrek' - but not much better. It's a very good movie all round, but not in the same league as 'Beauty and the Beast' or the Disney/Pixar movies. Mind you, what is?",Null,0,0,23 July 2001
The Emperor's New Groove," 'Bring it on.'
","'The Emperor's New Groove' is stylistically a break from Disney tradition - it's closer in tone to the Genie in 'Aladdin' or some of their TV shows than most of their movies, making a refreshing change. In fact, you could be forgiven for thinking that this isn't a Disney movie at all... the only talking animal has a good excuse for yapping in the voice of David Spade, the only romantic relationship is that between Pacha and his wife (and even there it's more the sign of a happily married couple), and apart from the Emperor's Theme Song Guy ('He's the hippest cat in creation...') - and Sting over the end credits, but we'll forgive that - no one bursts into song. Plus the emphasis is more on Warner Bros-type energetic humour than usual. No wonder it was a disappointment at the box office; not your traditional Disney movie.Then again, 'The Rescuers Down Under' was an underrated pleasure as well.The story isn't particularly different - you've got the ruler who has to change externally before he can change internally ('Beauty and the Beast'), Kronk, the good-hearted sidekick of the villain (Yzma) who can't bring himself to kill the hero ('Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'), and so on - but as is often the case it's not so much what the plot is as how it's handled. Although the movie suffers from 'Is-that...?' syndrome - it's too hard not to see Finch from 'Just Shoot Me!' every time Kuzco speaks (strangely enough, even though Pacha's wife has the voice of Wendie Malick from the same show, I never pictured Nina Van Horn... which isn't the case with 'Fillmore!', where Miss Malick voices Principal Folsom. Go figure) - the movie's speed, energy and high humour rate make it easy to forgive, with Kuzco and the bad guy's sidekick as standouts. The movie's also a bit more self-reverential than other Disney movies, notably in our hero's narration (plus at one point Yzma and Kronk notice they're leaving a blue trail behind them, which turns out to be the trail they leave on the map to the palace illustrating the race between them and our heroes).The surprising thing is that it even works with character - though the Emperor is enough of a self-absorbed hedonist (to a prospective wife: 'Let me guess - you've got a really great personality') to turn off Paris and Nicky Hilton, he and Pacha have a believable relationship throughout the movie, so that by the end we're rooting for him to get turned back into a human. Too bad Marc Shaiman's score was thrown out (he'd have been a natural, as opposed to John Debney), but no sense whining over what might have been. An adventure, a comedy and a drama all in one, 'The Emperor's New Groove' has everything that was notably absent from DreamWorks' own South American-set cartoon 'The Road to El Dorado' (charm, interest, no Elton John overdose and so on) and is the funniest movie from the House of Mouse since 'Aladdin.' It's easier to forgive them for giving the world 'Dinosaur' in 2000 as well.Why DOES she have that lever, anyway?",Null,59,65,20 March 2003
Bruce Almighty," Imagine if God was Ruby Wax, and then feel thankful we were stuck with Jim Carrey.
","Many have speculated on what they would do if they were God (of course, many have also speculated on whether or not there's a God in the first place, but that's another story). 'Bruce Almighty' offers one man's answer to this question, and does it in such a way that only the most hardened Bible-thumpers could take offence. Them, and the sort of people who think going down to Westminster and throwing things at David Blaine is really clever (i.e. the deeply cynical amongst us).Tom Shadyac's movie is well-served by its casting of Jim Carrey as a lightweight but ambitious TV reporter, Jennifer Aniston as his big-hearted girlfriend, and Morgan Freeman joining Alanis Morrissette, Sir Ralph Richardson, Charlton Heston, Gene Hackman (or rather, his voice) and George Burns - not to mention Eric Clapton - in the ranks of those who've played God; outside of 'The Simpsons,' the Almighty hasn't come across so winningly on screen since, well, ever. The storyline is something of a superhero story in reverse; most people get incredible powers and use them to help others from the off, but here the protagonist puts himself first and has to be prodded into helping others. Although the movie's very definitely on the side of helping people, and portrays his actions as amusing without actually condoning them - e.g. turning a rival's evening news stint into something more embarrassing than Albert Brooks's 'Broadcast News' debacle, increasing the size of his girlfriend's breasts, inspiring MacKenzie-off-'JAG' [as a work colleague] to wear outfits Paris Hilton would reject on grounds of skimpiness... okay, that last one was a lie - 'Bruce Almighty' thankfully never turns into an extended sermon. 'Touched By An Angel'/Michael Landon fans need not apply, in other words.The movie's finale is a bit predictable, but overall it's a pleasant little parable, designed to send you out of the cinema (or in my case out of the plane) with a smile on your face and a bit more hope in your heart. And infinitely less painful than some other Carrey movies.'Cue the cheesy inspirational music...!'",Null,0,2,20 September 2003
Signs," The most intimate invasion movie ever made?
","'The Twilight Zone' once had an episode called 'The Invaders' set entirely in a farmhouse, with a woman (Agnes Moorehead) battling a pair of tiny aliens; Richard Matheson, who wrote that episode, was not enamoured of the final product, claiming it was too slow and that the aliens looked ridiculous - and they do. Creatures that look like the Michelin Man are nowhere to be found in the thematically similar 'Signs,' but it does take its time. All to the good, it turns out.Whatever the M in 'M. Night Shyamalan' stands for, it clearly isn't 'Modest' - he's given himself cameos in both 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable,' and for this movie he's upgraded himself to what's practically a supporting role, although a key one. Still, it can be forgiven when the whole thing works as well as this; set in a small Pennsylvania town, disillusioned widowed ex-priest Mel Gibson discovers that his farm has become home to some very elaborate crop circles. At first he and his brother (Joaquin Phoenix) feel it's a prank, but then more start to appear... and I'll let other contributors spoil the plot. Suffice to say there's no twist ending this time, and that in spite of their prominent billing in the opening titles, Industrial Light and Magic visual effects supervisors Eric Brevig and Stefen Fangmeier are ultimately not the film's stars.The movie stays at a regular level for a lot of its length, setting up a perfectly realised world with plenty of well-judged character moments (the son's asthma, the daughter's irrational fear of drinking water, etc) - though there are plenty of intentionally amusing moments (people keep turning to Gibson's character for spiritual guidance even though he's no longer of the cloth), the movie's never allowed to become camp; when Shyamalan starts to turn the screws, the humour drains away but the tension doesn't. Most of what's happening elsewhere is related to us via the family's TV set (just as it would be in real life) and whatever the menace is is kept out of sight most of the time (until the climax, that is) - our hero's first reaction to getting a glimpse of it is to run like hell back to the house! Cowardly? Maybe, but you or I would almost certainly do the same thing...Ultimately, the ability to bring an alien invasion down to human terms, to make it more of an emotional experience than an all-out action yarn a la 'Independence Day' is one of the biggest plusses of the movie; the finale may seem absurd to some, but in the context of the laws 'Signs' sets itself it's no cop-out. Unlike 'The X-Files' it doesn't try and string you along endlessly, instead bringing everything together. It's not all-out horror, but it is endlessly absorbing and pretty scary, bolstered by the director's cast, the restrained special effects, and James Newton Howard's striking score. Though it may not seem like it from the posters, 'Signs' is ultimately very spiritual and almost uplifting; it's impossible to elaborate without ruining the movie, but those viewers who find it hard to accept that this world is all there is and that nothing just happens (and I must confess to being among that number) will find this movie very rewarding. This is a movie that hangs around.",10,0,3,6 September 2002
Identity," Comes close to being as clever as it thinks it is.
","At one point in 'Identity,' Clea DuVall points out the situation's similarity to Agatha Christie's 'Ten Little Indians' (though she doesn't actually mention the work by name), though no one can really call this movie a homage to the Jessica Fletcher ancestor. James Mangold's movie is the sort that works best if you don't know too much about it going in, so apart from the basic setup of a group of people finding themselves stuck in a motel in the middle of nowhere during a dark and stormy night, you won't get too much about the plot here.'Identity' certainly has a lot going for it - the plotline is intriguing, the movie is a return to a good old-fashioned murder mystery, and the director's got a good cast to play with; if you put John Cusack as a limo driver, Ray Liotta as a cop, Amanda Peet as a lady of the night, John C. McGinley as a stepfather, Jake Busey as a convicted murderer being transported to a hearing, Alfred Molina as a psychiatrist and the ever-lovely Rebecca DeMornay as a diva-ish actress in the same movie, you're unlikely to get a load of bad acting, and you don't. Alan Silvestri's effectively disorienting score and some real jolts help the movie's 90-minute running time move along efficiently as well.BUT...The movie's major plot twist is a problem - I won't give it away here, but if I could suss it out before it's revealed, then I can't be the only one to be a few steps ahead of writer Michael Cooney; his tendency to wrongfoot the audience, though it works more often than not, leads him to try and garnish the tale with red herrings... and he makes the mistake of trying to go for one twist too many at the end. Again, I won't reveal it here, but Chucky said it best in 'Child's Play 3' (or was it 2?) - 'Aw, man, you gotta be f***ing kidding me!' The more you think about it, the less sense it (and indeed various other plot points) makes. It's still worth seeing, and getting Amanda Peet into something decent is never a bad thing, but 'Identity' could have been a real gem instead of a flawed but diverting little thriller. And I admit to be miffed that the first person to be killed was... no, I'm not giving THAT away either.",Null,0,0,15 August 2003
X2: X-Men United," More proof that sequels and stinking don't have to go together.
","Warning: This has a slight spoiler.If the 'Justice League of America' pilot had been treated with the TLC that 'Spider-Man' and 'X-Men' got, the pilot would have not only sold but the series that would have resulted would still be running. One good movie from the concept would have been a blessing, but for 'X2' to continue the tradition is... all sequels should be this good. Not good enough to top the first one, but good enough to be an equal.Like all good sequels, this expands on the previous movie rather than rehashes it (the basic story has good and bad mutants alike teaming up to combat a common threat, but there's obviously more to it than that); there's more emphasis on story than setting up the characters (though kudos to writers Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris and David Hayter for giving space to both), although with so many characters a few slip through the cracks - minor ones, like the girl who can walk through walls, are one thing (although I wanted to see a bit more of her), but it's a bit hard to keep track of all of them. Not that it ever degenerates into confusion, though; it often plays like a live action take on those superb WB cartoons. Yes, that's a compliment. As well as keeping up the interesting aspects of its story while not overdoing the bigotry angle of its premise (some have called the relationship between Storm and Nightcrawler a romance, but they seem to bond more on a friendly level than a lovey-dovey one), the movie also has plenty for the more shallow viewers  the non-stop action and the special effects aside, the ladies are, I understand, best catered for with Hugh Jackman (far better here than as Van Helsing) and James Marsden, while the gentlemen get Famke Janssen, Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (whose Mystique gets more to do (and say) this time around, and even appears without the blue skin at one point) and Kelly Hu. (In one movie? YES!)SLIGHT SPOILER TIME.Although three of them won't be back for 'X-Men 3' - Kelly's Deathstryke and Famke's Jean Grey both die (and this not being 'Star Trek' it's unlikely they'll come back to life), and while Storm is still around Halle Berry's turned down the opportunity to play her again. (Since Berry's performance is an improvement on last time, this is to be regretted. Then again, since Storm is more of a waste of space than Jean, maybe not)END OF SLIGHT SPOILER TIME.The movie leaves some bits open, but doesn't feel like a cheat and certainly not like a setup for the third movie  just like part of an ongoing story. If the next round of 'Superman' and 'Batman' movies work as well as these, there WILL be a war. Just not between humans and mutants - between Marvel and DC fans.Oh yes, and John Ottman's end credit music has one of the best endings of its type...",Null,0,1,17 October 2004
Amélie," Victor likes: whimsical, romantic French movies with beguiling heroines. Victor doesn't like: cynics and snobs.
","I'm actually discussing 'Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain' (or 'Amélie,' as it's called in English) on my second viewing - I saw it on the big screen first, but I fell asleep during the first hour; this is something I also did during 'The 13th Warrior,' 'Mission To Mars' and the wildly overrated remake of 'Ocean's Eleven' (not that the original isn't itself overrrated, but that's another matter). But whereas my lack of interest in the other movies continued when I woke up, with 'Amélie' I continued to be enthralled by the strange mix of reality and fantasy that the heroine's world revolved around.Seeing it on video again, it worked just as well without any sleep interruptions; this hugely successful French movie may well be a basic trifle at its centre, and it may play at times like a Gallic take on 'Ally McBeal' with a dash of 'Emma' - a dreamy young woman takes it upon herself to move among people's lives for the better (helping those who deserve it and tormenting those who don't), but finds that she in turn needs help in sorting out her OWN life - but its high rating among IMDb users is understandable. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's movie sometimes overplays its quirkiness (having our heroine's mother die when a tourist jumps off the Cathedral of Notre Dame and lands on her? Giving Amélie's lover a job in a porn shop?), but most of the time the movie judges itself perfectly; with its good nature and optimism, it's one of those movies that almost defies you to hate it.Which means that it'll be condemned as being manipulative, sentimental tripe in some corners - but others'll find themselves gradually drawn into the movie's embrace, and won over by Audrey Tautou's central performance, by its clutch of characters (it's very satisfying when the assistant to the hateful greengrocer comes out of his shell), and by its overall lack of cynicism. (That must be why some people hate it so much; and why it was such a hit in France - 'How dare French people finance and go to see a movie that isn't pretentious, is accessible and makes you happy!')Come to think of it, I might see it again. Cue an Amélie-type smile...",Null,1,4,23 March 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," One trilogy to rule them all.
","The 'Star Wars' movies passed me by as a boy; I never saw the first movie in cinemas, and while I did see 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi' I'm still not, to this day, a true fan of George Lucas's pride and joy. The 'Matrix' movies... well, we won't talk about the first two (I still haven't seen 'The Matrix Revolutions' but I may do if Warner Bros. Entertainment swears on the CEO's blood that there'll be plenty of Monica Bellucci on the DVD).But 'The Lord of the Rings'... can you imagine how Peter Jackson's movies must affect kids aged around seven or eight? It would show Eve and Gwen Stefani a thing or 976 about blowing minds, that's for sure. This trilogy of movie adaptations has truly been event cinema, all the way to the end of 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.' It has absolutely everything, with the possible exception of a 'Previously on 'The Lord of the Rings'' recap, and the definite exceptions ofa) Christopher Lee (who was controversially miffed at the dropping of his scenes from the final cut, and it must be said that a Gandalf-Sauron face-off or indeed anything featuring the sonorous one wouldn't have gone amiss), andb) More of Liv Tyler (if ever a movie demonstrated that there is no movie, no matter how good, that could not be improved by a bit more of La Tyler, it's this one - the gorgeous one gets remarkably short shrift considering her billing, though compared to Cate Blanchett...).These flaws don't really get in the way of the scope of the movie - the staggering fight scenes work all the more because adapters Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Mr. Jackson never lose sight of the people/creatures at the centre of the story; Sam's undying devotion to Frodo [the true emotional core of the movie] has as much impact as the sight of Legolas singlehandedly bringing down a giant elephant-thing, and all the better for it. This isn't a damn TV movie rerouted to the big screen; this is the kind of thing movies were invented for, and it holds a spell on you all the way through, with the whole cast getting their times to shine, so by the end we really feel as if we're saying goodbye to real people. As superb as the FX (from WETA et al), Grant Major's impressive design, Andrew Lesnie's classy cinematography, Ngila Dickson and Richard Taylor's lovely costumes, Jamie Selkirk and Annie Collins's first-rate editing and especially Howard Shore's wonderful score are (alas, Academy rules about sequel scores prevented him getting a nomination for 'The Two Towers' and may well block him here as well), that's ultimately the biggest achievement on view here.At 200 minutes, this movie is an hour longer than 'The Matrix Reloaded' but feels shorter - do I have to say more? Actually, yes; the movie's need to wrap up the loose ends means it goes on a bit longer than it really has to (there seem to be at least five or six endings), but by this stage we've seen over nine hours of some of the most impressive storytelling in many a year or three, and that's the only real flaw in this final chapter. Arugably the best third instalment in screen history, and a rare case of something truly living up to its hype. Plus, it's helped bring fantasy to a wider audience, and H**** P***** notwithstanding, that's never a bad thing. Whatever I go to see on my birthday next year has a lot to live up to.'Farewell, good hobbits.'",Null,0,1,30 December 2003
Honey," It would have been impossible for this or any movie to be as sweet as Jessica Alba, but that doesn't keep it from trying.
","Any comparisons between 'Honey' and 'Glitter' are probably due to both movies having script-work by Kate Lanier (who, funnily enough, isn't listed on the completed movie)... and, of course, to their having slightly similar plots. Except that 'Glitter' is likely to be more of a black mark on Mariah Carey's book than 'Honey' is on Jessica Alba's.This movie about a kind-hearted young woman in New York who uses dancing to help the people in her neighbourhood (the people that she meets when she's walking down the street... sorry, couldn't resist) and who's plucked from a nightclub to become the Paula Abdul of the 21st century - she even has a little mole on her face - is aptly named; it's as sweet-natured as its title character and has little if any benefit on your system, except to slip down nice and easy and leave not very much behind. It's filled with all the realism you'd expect from the producer of 'Legally Blonde' and 'Josie and the Pussycats,' but it's not quite as much fun as either. Part of it is a personal thing (the Rodney Jerkins-executive produced music that permeates the movie isn't my thing, rhythmic though it is), but the thin, originality-challenged scripting and silly dialogue are more of a problem; when our bartender-by-night/dance-teacher-by-day heroine tells a kid 'Your flava's hot' it's a little embarrassing, although in fairness 'Honey''s street talk doesn't make you wince as much as some other examples of this kind of thing.To be honest, the movie pretty much goes in one ear and out the other; there's not a single truly dramatic moment, with the setbacks coming on cue (when Li'l Romeo's character gets arrested it, and many other moments in the movie, plays like a less-than-brilliant After School Special) and the characters are right out of Cliches Central, from the almost saintly title character to the sexually predatory rival dancer. (And note to the filmmakers: as anyone who's ever watched MTV, VH-1 et al will confirm, music videos don't credit the choreographer on screen... regardless of what the one that plays next to the movie's end credits might say.)
But it's impossible to really hate 'Honey'; the movie's too harmless and good-tempered for anyone to get into a hissyfit over its drawbacks, and though the R&B-flavoured cameos mean a lot of people who see this movie will probably be going 'Who's this Tweet person?' Missy Elliott is genuinely funny in her very brief scenes. The dancing's also good, which is one of the main reasons to go and see movies like this; and though it doesn't actually seem to have anything like a narrative drive (it just seems to end instead of climax), there have been worse movies from music video directors, e.g. almost anything directed by Russell Mulcahy.Oh yes, Jessica. She doesn't quite seem like the streetwise type, but she isn't supposed to be; she looks the part and comes off reasonably well, as well as having the edge over Jennifer Beals in 'Flashdance' in that she actually does most of her own dancing. This isn't really the best vehicle for her, to be honest, but Jessica's an undeniable charmer on screen, and far too sexy for this or anything she's been in (with the arguable exception of 'Paranoid') to be an unbearable experience. All she has to do is improve her choice of scripts...",Null,46,54,9 April 2004
Fantastic Four," It may not be fully fantastic, but it deserves more than four stars out of 10.
","Let's get this out of the way - 'Fantastic Four' is not as good as the best superhero movie of the past few years. But then again, not even the 'Spider-Man' movies are as good as 'The Incredibles,' so that was only to be expected.I think the reason a number of people were predicting/hoping this would be the disaster of the summer (a mantle that at the time of writing seems to be assumed by 'The Island' instead, which serves Michael Bay right for producing 'The Amityville Horror') is that the movie was deliberately setting out to be not as Important as other Marvel/DC comic book movies of late - less brooding, more lightweight and enjoyable. That, and the strange casting in front of and behind the camera (Hornblower as Mr. Fantastic? Chris 'Not that one' Evans as the Human Torch? The bloke from 'Nip/Tuck' who used to go out with Dannii Minogue as Dr. Doom - though he's never referred to as such in the movie? And the multiracial and sexy-beyond-belief Jessica Alba as the very WASPy Sue? Even Alba fans objected to casting the latter as someone who is, after all, regularly invisible). And the fact that Simon Kinberg (who already has two strikes with 'xXx2' and 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' - I don't care if that was a hit, I didn't like it) gave an ultimately uncredited hand to the script.And while it's true that the special effects sometimes aren't of 'The Lord of the Rings' quality (the scene where the immodestly dubbed Mr. Fantastic falls down a building is distressingly cartoonish), that the movie isn't as effective with the love story between Reed, Susan and Victor Von Doom as with the Thing and the Human Torch, and that there aren't as many all-out action scenes as you could wish for - the battles don't come along until well into the movie - it does work when you take it on its own terms instead of expecting a dark, gritty origins movie. (Though let's face it, who expects doom and gloom from a movie executive produced by Chris Columbus?) Unlike 'Elektra,' it's not ashamed to please its audience and has a healthy sense of humour about itself - so healthy that it almost becomes a bit camp, but only almost.With three appealing turns from our title quartet (only Ioan Gruffudd lets the side down as Reed Richards, not quite living up to his name of Mr. Fantastic; Michael Chiklis and especially Chris Evans have the most colourful roles and really bolster the movie when they're on, and though Jessica Alba has less scope in her role as the Invisible Woman she's nowhere near as lost as, say, Katie Holmes in 'Batman Begins'), attempts to infuse emotion into the story that keep your attention until the fights start, and a villain in Julian McMahon's Victor who at least has more going for him than the ones in - yes, again - 'Batman Begins,' it's nothing more than a good, unambitious movie. The movie could have done without the songs over the credits though (John Ottman's score isn't Elfman or Williams, but at least he has a good old-fashioned heroic fanfare here), but that's hardly a major criticism. And be honest; would you rather have something that shoots relatively low and hits the target, or something that overreaches and dies? Then again, this is a movie that has Jessica Alba in Spandex. And materialising in her underwear. And saying things like 'It's been a good two years, Victor' and 'We can only stay for one drink because I have to go and meet Victor.' Did you really think I was going to hate it? Did you really?",7,1,3,30 July 2005
A Walk to Remember," Finally I can forgive Mandy Moore for 'Candy.'
","By rights, I shouldn't have cared for 'A Walk To Remember' - not only does it scream 'painfully predictable sapfest' but it prominently features pop starlet turned movie starlet Mandy Moore, the tall maiden responsible for the skin-crawlingly bad single 'Candy' and one of the problems with the otherwise quite appealing 'The Princess Diaries.' And it does start off badly, with our hero (Shane West) getting arrested after a dare out by a factory goes wrong and everyone runs for it. It also doesn't help that practically everyone he goes to school with is some kind of stereotype (especially his black best friend - there are black guys who don't like hip-hop, you know). And then there's the quiet, almost saintly girl who he has to do the school play with, and who's his polar opposite, especially in matters of faith.And yet... and yet... The movie is, in fact, pretty affecting. True, everyone but the two main characters is pretty flimsy; yes, Mandy's solo number in the school play does have 'gratuitous' written all over it; indeed, it doesn't add up to all that much in the end; but the movie's too sincere in its approach to really despise, and while it does have a pro-faith agenda it doesn't take a Jehovah's Witness approach to its story, thanks to a lot of restraint in its telling and acting - no Big Dramatic Moments (even though some of the story turns would almost justify it), just plenty of heart.'A Walk To Remember' actually did better at the US box office than Britney Spears's 'Crossroads' - while I'm a Britney man, I have to admit that this movie deserved to do so. It may be sentimental drama, but it's pretty good sentimental drama. (And yes, Mandy Moore can act.)",Null,21,41,31 May 2004
Sin City," 'I don't know about you, but I'm having a ball...'
","'Sin City' finally proves that it is possible to make an entire living breathing movie through green screen and do it properly (as opposed to 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow') - it's 'Dick Tracy' without the ego, it's Robert Rodriguez finally fully atoning for 'From Dusk Till Dawn,' it's... I'm gushing, aren't I? In keeping with this comic book/graphic novel/whatever adaptation's title, let's tie this in with the Seven Deadly Sins.PRIDE: The characters in each story have their share of it - they may not be too proud of what they are, but they'll be damned if they'll let it drag them down into the morass. Marv, Dwight and Hartigan can all stand tall (or they would were it not for Dwight being the only one not dead by the end of the movie), and the female characters similarly won't let anyone push them around; even the sweet Nancy doesn't give That Yellow Bastard the satisfaction of screaming when he whips her brutally. Not a wimp in the bunch (well, maybe Becky).ANGER: You bet. Marv's quest for vengeance for the dead Goldie; the Old Town Girls defending their turf; Hartigan not letting anyone hurt the little girl/grown woman he loves... there's fury all through this trip through Basin City. It's part of what fuels these characters, along with good old-fashioned love. Anger is also what may result from a few of the performances, but only a few (Michael Madsen is pretty one-note, even in this milieu, and Clive Owen's US accent is a bit dodgy, but otherwise the cast - Willis, Rourke, Boothe, Wood, even little parts like Michael Clarke Duncan and Josh Hartnett - is terrific all round.)ENVY: This is more of an audience thing; viewers envying all the testosterone-dripping but yet still sensitive (in a way) men with hardware at the ready and macho voiceovers to spare, not to mention a city with no ugly women anywhere in sight. ('Sin City' is not exactly a chick flick, making Alexis Bledel the performer with the most diametrically opposed movies this summer - see also 'The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.') LUST: With all due respect to female fans of Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro, this is very much one for the men. Carla Gugino wearing nothing but a thong. Barmaid Brittany Murphy (the only cast member to appear in all three stories). Rosario Dawson as the leader of the Old Town Girls. Jaime King, Alexis Bledel and especially silent but deadly Devon Aoki as three of said prostitutes. The olive-skinned, almond-eyed, lush-lipped, sensuous gift to straight men everywhere that is Jessica Alba. All stunners, and all, as Marv puts it, 'worth killing for, worth dying for, worth going to hell for. Amen.' COVETOUSNESS: George Lucas only wishes he could manage actors as well as this - Rodriguez and Frank Miller make the technology serve the movie, not the other way around.GREED: You may well want more of the stylized look of Basin City, the black-and-white with splashes of colour (the eyes always stay in colour), the dazzling ultra-violence... this truly is poetry in motion. Gruesome? You bet (Marv literally leaving a villain for the wolves, Miho slicing villains left and right, Hartigan getting shot several million times - not to mention what he does to TYB), but if you can take it, you'll want more, more, more.SLOTH: Well, the stories may be pretty slim, especially the final one (a bit lazy in that respect), but in this world it's not what's told so much as the way it's told. And the way it's told is mind-blowing... 'Sin City' may not be for everyone, but from the moment Rodriguez's sax music kicks in (he also did the score for the last story, with Graeme Revell mainly handling the first, and John Debney the second) it's a trip very, very worth taking. Sequel, please. (And bring back Jessica; after That Dress at the MTV Movie Awards...)",8,3,6,20 June 2005

Shark Tale," It's not fair to compare this to 'Finding Nemo.' Now 'Jabberjaw' on the other hand...
","The best moment of 'Shark Tale' comes in the beginning, when the little boy in the DreamWorks Animation logo casts his fishing line out from the moon and sends the hook with a worm on it down to the sea. Unfortunately it serves as a cue for one of the movie's problems  when two sharks come along, one humming John Williams' shark motif from 'Jaws' to the disgust of the other, and the first one says 'Hey, it's our theme song,' we're supposed to think it's clever. It's not  it's obvious, and it's also representative of the movie's fondness for riffing off pop culture aspects - something 'The Simpsons' also does, but it also does far more than this movie does. This laziness is so prevalent throughout the movie that the overall effect is of something that's computer-generated in more ways than one.The story is dull, clichéd and predictable  it's shocking that such an impressive cast was convinced to bring life to a script that's on a level with 'Fish Police,' with its endless bad fish-related puns and dreary plotting. Come to think of it, the voice cast is another problem; there used to be a time when animated movies didn't feel the need to plaster the names of the voice actors, whether known or unknown, on the posters and in the trailers but even some of the TV spots for 'Shark Tale' featured the live actors during the recording sessions, making it feel even more like a corporate concoction than it already is (and why did the producers gather such an impressive cast and then give them practically nothing to do?). The characters Smith, Jolie, DeNiro, and company are voicing aren't a help either  unlike 'Finding Nemo' (I know I said it's not fair, but the point has to be made), we're denied anyone to give a toss about because they're nearly all stereotyped ciphers (especially the Jamaican jellyfish voiced by Doug E. Doug and Ziggy Marley), with Will Smith proving that even in animation he has to hog the limelight... if any character here is the star, it's Jack Black's fey shark (who practically has 'gay' stamped on his fins). Just to add to the irritation, the movie's commercial instincts all but override the storyline  it often plays like an extended TV spot for its soundtrack (and both the songs and Hans Zimmer's score are nothing to write home about), especially with the presence of Missy Elliott and Christina Aguilera in fish and jellyfish form performing their appalling version of 'Car Wash'  as if the live-action forms weren't repellent enough already.With its sledgehammer winks to adults (although the newspaper ad for a horror movie called 'The Hook' modeled on DreamWorks' version of 'The Ring' and casting Peter Falk and two cast members of 'The Sopranos' as mob sharks is almost okay) and the overall feeling of a bad '80s TV cartoon dressed up in 2004 silver screen trimmings, 'Shark Tale' has no chance of being included as one of the three nominees for Best Animated Feature if there's justice in this world. And who decided to include British morning TV irritant Fiona Phillips on the UK release print (Fiona replaces Katie Couric as the voice of on-the-spot reporter Katie Current, which pretty much removes any possible point to the fish's name)? Fiona Phillips and Christina Aguilera have no business being on the same credit roll as Martin Scorsese and Renee Zellweger.",4,1,5,6 November 2004
Cinderella Man," Russell Crowe and Ron Howard win on points.
","I'm not a fan of boxing, and I'm certainly not an admirer of Russell Crowe - but 'Cinderella Man' may well be Ron Howard's best movie since 'Apollo 13' (I've yet to see 'A Beautiful Mind,' but since Akiva Goldsman is the primary writer on that, I'm not holding my breath), and a rare sports movie that even I like.At heart it's a feelgood movie, but the kind that reviewers can like without feeling guilty - no actual gloss, plenty of grit, and no cheating. Done with skill and care by the director and writers Cliff Hollingsworth and Goldsman, the story of boxer Jim Braddock's early promise and his toils through the Depression may wear its bid for Oscar glory a bit too obviously sometimes, but with Crowe as Braddock, the excellent Paul Giamatti as his trainer, Renee Zellweger as his wife and the rest of the cast on top form, you just don't notice enough for it to matter.The boxing scenes are far from 'Rocky'-type showbiz, though for some reason Braddock's fight against Lasky seems a bit more dramatic than his climax against Max Baer; but the best thing about the movie is that it would be just as gripping even without the violence (witness the second scene where he goes to the relief office). A few of the relationships are a bit sketchy - certainly that with his best friend could have been dealt with a bit more - but ultimately the movie keeps you going right up to the finish.I'm finding it a lot easier to write about bad movies than good ones, so I'll just say that in spite of it not having Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, 'Cinderella Man' is a genuine million dollar baby.",8,0,0,23 September 2005
The Island," Maybe they should have just called it 'Lincoln's Run.'
","There's a moment in 'The Island' when newly liberated clone Scarlett Johansson sees the original woman she's cloned from in a department store display, complete with a commercial starring her on TV. When she sees herself, it's supposed to be a poignant moment of recognition (well, according to the unsubtle Steve Jablonsky music playing), but since the display is for Calvin Klein - which the gorgeous Scarlett has shilled for in real life (and indeed it's her actual TV ad we see) - it falls short of impact, just coming across as a cheap gag. Plus the client's name is Sara Jordan.Sara Jordan... Scarlett Johansson... get the idea?This is, sadly, pretty typical of Michael Bay's first baby steps as a director outside of the Bruckheimerverse; the movie really wants to be a clever science-fiction exercise and a cracking action thriller, but while it's not really a disaster it still falls far short of the 'Total Recall'/'Minority Report' league. Maybe it should have had a Philip K. Dick source rather than one by a man whose last major credit was the direct-to-video-in-the-UK Angelina Jolie movie 'Beyond Borders'; it's kind of like an inexperienced student trying to tackle a subject far beyond his reach - the movie tries but just doesn't have what it takes.The script by Caspian Tredwell-Owen and the team of Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci is derivative, for sure (especially 'Logan's Run' - for Logan read Lincoln, for Jessica read Jordan, for Carousel read The Island, for the Elders read Sean Bean and the other staff, for Francis read the guy played by Djimon Hounsou, and so on), but what makes 'The Island' really a letdown is that from time to time you get glimpses of what this could have been like. Every time Steve Buscemi is on screen it gets some life (until he's killed off, alas), and one wishes he could have been the star rather than Ewan McGregor; the movie also has some interesting ideas in its core when it's not flinging rapidly edited chases at you, and if it had managed to look at all the repercussions of clones it would have hit its high aspirations of being a popcorn movie with ideas.Unfortunately the shallow characterisation makes that impossible, and 'The Island' also sidesteps any potentially plot-crippling moral problems of humans and clones by making Young Obi-Wan's original a jerk (although since he himself admits he's not willing to die any more than the clone is, how does our hero have the moral high ground?) and having the pouting one's source material be in a coma (and be the mother of a young boy, and have her subplot more or less swept under the carpet in a sentence or two near the end). So that's all right then. (Incidentally, one female clone is killed after giving birth to the baby that the original client couldn't have; so artificial insemination doesn't exist at this time? And what about a less expensive form of surrogate motherhood? And if the original can't have children, what makes them think a clone would be any different?) Always watchable but never exciting or compelling, 'The Island' is ultimately not an improvement on Kurtzman & Orci's work on 'Alias' and 'Xena: Warrior Princess,' or even the 'Logan's Run' TV series; it doesn't have even Scarlett Johansson in a minidress without a bra. (Dammit.) Michael Bay has yet to be the Robert Zemeckis to Jerry Bruckheimer's Steven Spielberg.",6,7,14,26 July 2005
