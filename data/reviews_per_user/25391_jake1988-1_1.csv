Hereditary," Absolute Terrible
","Absolute Terrible and not in a good sense. I started watching this movie after I saw it had a good imbd rating and I thought that it should be good. The movie started well and was building up tension, I thought great,it must be good. But after the first half the movie is just rubbish. Don't let me get to the ending,absolute ridiculous. I would normally give it a 4 but since it has such a high rating I have to balance it out. So it 1 star from me.",1,4,8,29 December 2018
