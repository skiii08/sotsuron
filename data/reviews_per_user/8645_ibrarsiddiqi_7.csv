Skyfall," Bond, shaken and definitely stirred.
","My love of Bond definitely lay with the earlier actors who delivered Bond as suave, confident, intelligent spy who served on Her Majesty's behalf in the interests of Great Britian in the Cold War era in which Fleming based his fictional character upon.Enter Daniel Craig who brings a harder, grittier, focused Bond with a killer edge capable of dispatching both friend and foe effortlessly. To take on a well established role and bring your own interpretation of Britain's well loved spy is difficult enough initially but Daniel has moulded Bond to his best of acting experience in 'Skyfall'. Having not seen his previous outings as Bond, I had to watch and form my own opinions.'Skyfall' opens with a surprise exit of Bond for six months thanks to a colleague acting upon a decision made by 'M', leaving British Intelligence operatives fully exposed, there are repercussions for 'M' who is effectively under orders to retire following the fiasco. British intelligence is unaware that Bond has survived but is shaken to the core after being shot. We see him drink himself to oblivion but sobers up when he decides to pay 'M' visit after M16 is attacked in London. M16 have regrouped and are operating underground literally with Bond who must now find his nerve but we see his vulnerability he's still pressed into action despite reservations. Bond seeks to find who has the list of his comrades and seeks a ghost operative whose ruthlessness knows no limits. With Bond in Shanghai, he is exposed and subsequently brought of out his shell taking on a adversary determined to stop at nothing, even bringing the fight back to the ancestral home in Scotland.The film itself in the former half is refreshing, it changed my opinion of Craig's abilities but the latter half of the film felt incomplete and wholly slower than I'd expected as Mendes fails to deliver. Craignshould have been given artistic licence and free reign to take Bond further but is limited by poor direction and the desire to finish a plot that was rushed somewhat.Not fully disappointed, I believe Craig can do better but with a better director but bravo to him to showing different facets of Bond's usually suave character.",8,1,5,30 January 2017
Yes Man," It's a very positive Yes Man from me.
","Stumbled upon this film whilst browsing the DVD section of the local Poundland so I couldn't resist both a great film with Jim Carrey and bargain. Carrey's comedic talent is suited to the story-line and it cheered me immensely after going through an intense period in my life.The story centres around Carl whose life is an rut of negativity, he's in job with little prospect, avoids any social contact with close friends and is nursing a huge hole in his heart. One day, whilst eating lunch outside work close friend Nick tells him how he's turned his life around by saying yes to life. Nick throws a rock through the glass-front leaving with a leaflet in his hand to attend a meeting of this.Carl's scepticism leads him still to attend a meeting full of Yes people where upon he says no and meets Terence (Terence Stamp) who immediately changes Carl's mindset bringing home an avalanche of positivity, good luck and romance.The film is brilliant, it's similarity in someway to Bruce Almighty brings home a very positive message to us all.Prepare to say Yes and enjoy!",8,0,0,1 February 2017
Léon: The Professional," Action, but not as you know it.
","I can only describe this film as an excellent piece of work from the director Luc Besson and the the cast of Leon. The story centres around a professional assassin called Leon. Leon (Jean Reno) is cold, calculating and professional and naturally lives alone in his apartment with his plant. He has no friends other than his handler Tony (Danny Aiello)but one day that all changes when a rouge policeman Stansfield (Gary Oldman) murders a drug dealer and his young family living close to Leon. Enter Mathilda (Natalie Portman), who survived the attack - she begs for Leon to take her in and he does unwittingly.Mathilda is hellbent on avenging the death of her parents and younger brother, she asks Leon to train her to become an assassin, Leon works alone and gradually lets her into his world with fatal consequences as he dies whilst trying to assassinate Stansfield and his crew.The film is gritty, hard and the action is typically Luc Besson and is an example of what can be made when studios do't interfere with pure genius.",9,3,3,24 March 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," J.R.R Tolkien would have been so proud.
","If you never had the opportunity to read the book of the same title then this film will seduce you enough to read the great works of Tolkien himself.The book was written by Tolkien after having grown up in Birmingham after emigrating with his mother and younger brother. Tolkien was the master of fantasy literature, his mind brought alive a world in which good and evil, dark and light could easily exist within our times.Peter Jackson took the book and assembled a high calibre cast, he took the story apart, supported it with a dramatic music score that heightened your senses whilst sat in your seat. The adaptation was magnificent, it drove many of us film fans to the cinemas in droves globally, we demanded more and Jackson delivered Tolkien's Middle Earth alive.The casting of Elijiah Wood as 'Frodo' and Ian McKellen as 'Gandalf' galvanised the desire to see good triumph, against all the odds, over evil. As you watch, the characteristics of all the main characters are brought alive as you'd have imagined Tolkien would have done himself.The length of many films now falls shy of two hours but the Lord of the Rings trilogy held the most impatient of film lovers lusting for more. My home town, Birmingham, inspired Tolkien as a young boy and his creativity by the wonders of it's natural beauty. Many tourists came to my home town feeling the magic that brought us together to love Tolkien himself. This film (and its sequels) brought a greater appreciation of literature to us all, in fact inspiring so many of us to read and imagine so much more.",9,1,1,29 January 2017
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," A must see
","Having watched the original in my youth, I sat back with an open mind. The movie, directed by Ben Stiller, was a worthwhile reboot centering around Walter Mitty whose mundane life is punctuated by daydreams to escape reality. Walter works for Life magazine and happens to be a manager of Negative Assets and his employment is threatened imminently. The magazine decides to use the negative from elusive photographer Sean O'Connell (subtly played by Sean Penn). Walter receives a gift from Sean, unbeknownst to him that the negative 25 is inside it. Under pressure by ruthless change manager Ted, Walter embarks upon an epic journey (both of mind and soul) to track down Sean and the missing negative emerging a changed man. I love the play on words 'head of negative assets' as we have them to a varying degree and Ben's acting superbly delivers a transformation of man whose shy and living a truly unremarkable life to emerge from chrysalis a confident individual, eventually winning the heart of his crush Cheryl. The pairing of Penn and Stiller is an excellent choice, it subtly brings inspiration and confidence of Walter and the audience as the film plays on. The photography is amazing with Stiller negotiating Greenland by long-board, bicycle and on foot meeting locals who evacuate in the midst if a volcanic eruption.The film inspired myself and many others to take a long, hard look at my present, dieting the negativity from it to seek a better future.A worthwhile and entertaining effort by Ben and it's worth watching.",10,2,3,12 February 2017
The Green Mile," Cinematic gold.
","If you've never seen 'The Green Mile', then you need to at least once in your lifetime. A truly beautiful adaptation of Stephen King's book of the same name based in Death Row of an American prison between the 1920 and 1930'The backdrop is a hot, unforgiving summer in what was the springtime of the guards lives. Led by Tom Hanks's character Paul Edgecomb, the men discover the extraordinary gifts of a prisoner by the the name of John Coffey who was to be executed for the rape and murder of two little girls. John was played by the late Michael Duncan Clarke, a man whose soulful demeanour and muscular build brought the adaptation of the character alive from the very first minute you meet him on screen. Despite John's size, his gentle demeanour and vulnerability soon reveals an extraordinary gift as Paul opens up to John about his urine infection. The guards set about utilising him to cure others. The film brings to the fore the harsh reality of the guards duties whereby they walk the condemned prisoners to their eventual execution along the last walk of their lives along the green painted floor dubbed 'The Green Mile'.The film depicts the array of emotions one would naturally expect, purveying the horrors of prison life, remorse and eventually death. Characters such as Wild Bill and Percy, both cruel and sadistic, thwart the lives of Paul, his men and prisoners under his charge. John, whilst in transit, discovers that Wild Bill is the true murderer of the two girÄºs for whom he'd eventually be executed for dispenses his own justice upon him. Percy, after deliberately sabotaging an execution of a prisoner, also receives a similar fate of his own when John infects him with a tumour thus leaving an inpatient of the local psychiatric hospital.The film is tinged with both good times and sad, particularly when John is finally executed, breaking the spirits of Paul and the guards fortunate to have met him.It truly is a piece of cinematic gold and needs to be watched from start to finish in its entirety, giving you an appreciation of life's trials and tribulations.",10,1,2,18 January 2017
The Shawshank Redemption," A prison film with a difference
","A truly magnificent film for any film fan. Its harsh reality of the criminal justice system in twentieth century America captivates your curiosity. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman two criminals convicted to remain in the confines of Shawshank for life. Both men emanate opposing ends of society, in that Tim is beaten savagely by prisoners learning that life in prison was bitter. Morgan Freeman recognises Tim's need to survive, striking up a friendship that eventually, with time, benefits other prisoners are left to rot. It's more than one man, but its the depiction of struggle and determination emanating from the film adaptation of Stephen King's story 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption'that anyone could be face in our lives.A must see film that will change 160 minutes of your life.",10,0,0,23 January 2017
