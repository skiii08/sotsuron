Miracle," Great film
","This is definitely an under-appreciated film, not a lot of talk about it. With that said, its one that stays with you. I love sports movies, especially ones about underdogs. Usually they are about 1 person, or a specific team that has made history for doing something remarkable. Miracle is more than a person, more than a team, its about the entire country.I'm proud to be an American, and usually get a bit emotional when something big happens with the entire world watching. I was 3 years old when the 1980 Olympics took place, but watching this movie, I felt like I was there. I felt the emotion of crowd, the players, and that damn amazing coach. Kurt's performance was outstanding, and one that is now in my top 15 movie performances ever. I found myself forgetting it was Kurt.With sports movies, there is always a scene where the team has to 'dig deep' during a practice or what not, you kind of expect it. With that said, the scene when he made the team run the line drills over and over and over and OVER again made me cringe, but ended up being one of my favorite of the film. It was raw, real, and refreshing.Great film about the American spirit, a guy with a dream, and a team that became...a family.",8,2,2,3 July 2013
Rocky," Just watched this...wow.
","I know it's a bit crazy I am JUST now watching this. I was born 7 years after the film was made, but, I do enjoy watching films that the general public have pegged 'classics', not matter when they were released. I've heard about this movie for years, but never got around to watching it. To be honest, a lot of films that were made decades ago, sometimes lose their appeal a bit on me. I think its because movies were filmed a bit different back then, in other words, film making has evolved...its changed. Not that I don't appreciate or respect them or understand their appeal to audiences back then. With all that said, Rocky didn't make me feel that way...at all. The build up was good, you felt like you really understood who Rocky was, what he was about. The first contact with him and Adrian was special...perfect. When he ran after his manager after losing it in his apartment...touching.I could go on and on. Really good film...cant wait to watch the others.",8,0,0,15 June 2013
