Walk the Line," Phoenix needs a new job!
","Phoenix as CASH was a bad idea! He is dense and cant get anything through his head in the movie....I think Phoenix needs a new job because he acts as the same little PUSSY cat in all his films. He made Johnny Cash out to be someone I believe he was not. J.Phoenix ruined the entire film for me so thats why I rate this film a 1 on a 10 scale. Find a new Job! The ending was a bit abrupt and sudden, Like the maker had too much information and just lopped off the entire back half of Johnny Cash Life. In my opinion the casting was just off other than Reese. It's too bad that a great film movie had to end like this. I think it should be made over but there is no chance that will happen. There was never anything said about own Johnny Cash in his later years! His career did not end in the 60's! To top things off, No one aged in the film from the 40's to the 60's, what happened there? Overall.................Not good and very disappointing because I really enjoy Johnny's Music.",1,10,28,7 March 2006
