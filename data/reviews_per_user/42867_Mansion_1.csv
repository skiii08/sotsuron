The Blair Witch Project," The most truly scary film I've seen in years.
","The Blair Witch Project is the first film in years that I've actually lost sleep over.  It's a remarkable achievement that proves the scariest mysteries are still the ones that go bump in the night--the monsters under the bed, the silhouette in the window.  With virtually none of the typical Hollywood gimmicks like surprise plot twists or red herrings, and no special effects except for a skillful use of light and dark, sound and silence, and the talents of three smart actors, the Blair Witch Project reminds you what fear really feels like.  Fear as you can only feel it in your deepest childhood nightmares or darkest adult anxieties.  It burrows into your subconscious and drags you through the woods right along with the cast and crew.  It's a great night at the movies, but you may have to sleep with the lights on for several days afterward.",9,0,1,5 August 1999
