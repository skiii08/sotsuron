Marie Antoinette," A comedy of excess
","Marie Antoinette is most famous for her extravagant excess and her tragic demise, but in her biopic of the last French queen Sophia Coppola makes the interesting choice of focusing only on her years at Versailles, a period which spans roughly 15 years, from 15 to 30. The story is a familiar one to anyone who has ever watched (or read) a female-focused story about a European royal. A rich woman is sold off through marriage to a cold/unkind/unfaithful/un-relatable equally wealthy royal and she spends the rest of the movie tragically flitting around the extravagant scenery, looking ravishing while bemoaning the fact that she can buy everything but her husbands love. What makes Marie Antoinette rather unique in the royal biopic tradition is that Coppola decides to bypass most of the melodrama in order to celebrate the up-beat, witty, teen-queen who charmed France and handled her royal problems with grace and dignity. I've never been a fan of Kirsten Dunst, but her sunny disposition and little girl looks are perfect here. She is at once graceful and naïve, over-spending but at the same time dutiful and eager to please. Dunst's comic timing in this movie is impeccable. When she is forced to speak to Madame du Barry, she nails the casually bored voice that demonstrates the ridiculousness of the situation and her reluctance to be a part of it. She is also careful to portray Marie Antoinette as innocent and ignorant rather then out and out stupid. In one particularly cute scene the queen declares that she would like to have large trees planted all along a walk-way. When she is reminded that money in the royal coffers is tight, she generously decides to go with the 'little trees' rather then spend all that money on the larger ones. I must admit I was also extremely skeptical when I heard that Coppola had cast her cousin, Jason Schwartzman, as Marie Antoinette's husband but he too handles his (mostly silent) role perfectly. He is the quiet, shy, foil to Dunst's sunny queen, the dweeb to her cheerleader. Coppola plays up the differences between them for comedic effect, and it works well. You can imagine that if Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI were average teenagers in modern day France, they wouldn't even talk to each other, and yet because of the age they live in and their political positions they are forced into a bizarre, yet friendly, marriage. The ensemble is incredibly tight, with cameos by many accomplished actors. Judy Davis steals every scene she's in, Molly Shannon and Shirley Henderson (random side note: Shirley Henderson is hilarious AND brilliant. Someone needs to give her a leading role.) play the two bitchy tantes to perfection, Asia Argento is slimy and seductive as the trashy Madame du Berry, Rose Byrne is sumptuous as the saucy Duchess du Polignac and on and on. The movie itself works best in its first half. The painfully funny inability of Louis XVI to consummate his marriage provides the plot for the first half of the movie. As Marie Antoinette learns the ridiculous rules of the French court and makes room for her own traditions she is constantly kept grounded by the fact that her husband refuses to bed her and that she has yet to provide any heirs to the throne. Coppola lovingly flits from the church, to the dining hall, to the bedroom giving us a feel for the whirlwind of monotony that becomes Marie Antoinette's life. Like many directors, she is fascinated by the golden cage imprisoning her heroine and yet unlike so many directors she openly invites her audience to laugh at the excesses and childish naïveté of her characters. When Marie Antoinette's brother drops by for a visit he is the one who must explain the act of sex to young Louis by using a key and lock metaphor, hilarious since the only thing Louis seems to show any interest in are locks and keys. Sadly, once the marriage is consummated and the longed for dauphins and dauphines arrive any narrative thread is dropped and the movie instead becomes a series of cobbled together vignettes. Marie Antoinette takes a lover, loses said lover, has some children, and then loses some children. Not that the vignettes are not beautiful and effective, only that the treatment of Antoinette's twenties seems hurried compared to the fun, easy-going pace of her teens. In one of the touching final scenes of the movie, Louis and Marie Antoinette eat an opulent dinner together as they have done since their first meeting and marriage. As in their first dinner there are many ridiculous rules and protocols to be observed but the difference between that first meal and this one are striking. With most of the royal court forced into exile there is no one but the servants there to observe them. Rather than an orchestra to provide them music to accompany their meal there is the unceasing angry chanting of a mob. But Marie Antoinette, looking at her husband the same way she did at their first meal together, many years ago, reaches across the table in order to hold his hand and provide him with comfort. They know the years of indolence and extravagance which made their teen years a never-ending party are over. And yet, together, they are still willing to stay at Versailles now that the party is over; to try and rule and to face the consequences of their ignorance. Coppola seems to be taking a bit of a breather between films in order to take care of her new baby but I hope she returns to the camera and soon. I'm not a huge fan of the Virgin Suicides, but her work on Lost in Translation and Marie Antoinette show that she's a director with a vision and a message, and I can't wait to see what she does next.",8,1,2,26 September 2008
Detroit," Bigelow gets it wrong
","I'm a huge fan of director Kathryn Bigelow and when I heard that she was making this film and when rumours leaked out that it was going to primarily be focused on the Algiers motel murders I was more excited than ever. It seemed like the perfect project for Bigelow to tackle. Unfortunately the result is a messy, gloopy, half-committed mess and Bigelow never quite succeeds at bringing to life a half-baked script.Now to start off the film is not solely focused on the Algiers Motel incident. It's a film in three parts, the first dealing with the start of the riots in Detroit, the second zeroing in on the terror at the Algiers, and the third showing the trial that happened as a result of the Algiers murders. Right away Bigelow gets it wrong. The rioting that took place is poorly explained and she and writer Mark Boal actually mostly shows the start of the riots from the perspective of the police, bizarrely making it seem like rioters were just interested in looting despite the fact that there were multiple reasons why they were angry and lashing out. As a result the first third of the movie is just like a noxious clash of violence and terror as Bigelow introduces and obliterates so many characters, the violence seeming random and unending and not in a good way. The final third of the movie is similarly sloppy; I've seen court room dramas handled with more grace, and subtlety on Law & Order. However the middle section, at the Algiers, is where most of the pieces come together. If there's one thing to trust Bigelow on it's scenes of torture and she spares nothing when it comes to these scenes. Now I've heard criticism saying that these scenes amount to torture porn and I disagree, the violence in this section is necessary to show just how brutal what happened was. Bigelow isn't glorying in the moment but she isn't flinching away from it either. This happened and she wants her audiences to know it and understand it and feel angry and hurt and ashamed because of it. Unfortunately the rest of the movie just doesn't rise to the level of the middle section leaving the film as a half-baked mess. Only because Bigelow is such a talent is the film still somewhat worthwhile to watch because despite everything there is much to criticize and some to admire. The best parts of the movie are the cast (almost uniformly stellar but Anthony Mackie, Algee Smith, John Boyega and Jacob Latimore are standouts) and the costumes. There may not be many speaking roles for women in the film but there were a lot of women extras and the clothes they wear are FANTASTIC.A missed opportunity from Bigelow.",7,1,6,22 August 2017
Nightcrawler," Well crafted look at a sociopath
","There have been many movies that critique capitalism, the American dream, and the increasing voyeurism in American culture. Nightcrawer ranks among the best of them. Dan Gilroy's work is so stunningly crafted that it's hard to believe this his debut. The film follows the rise of Louis Bloom (a truly transformed Jake Gyllenhaal). When we meet Bloom he is working as a petty thief, struggling to find a profession in the midst of a recession and unable to find work. He takes his setbacks in stride, constantly on the lookout for opportunity and a chance to move upwards. That moment comes at the site of a car crash. Slowing down his car to watch as two police officers struggle to free a woman as her car quickly goes up in flames, Louis notices some men aggressively filming the rescue operation. After pumping one of the cameramen for information he learns that they are free lance photographers, working to find the bloodiest most gruesome footage and selling it to morning news shows who keep looking for bloodier and bloodier footage to maintain what little viewership they still have. Stealing his way into obtaining a cheap camcorder Louis sets out to get his own slice of this gruesome pie and it isn't long before he begins to climb his way up the ladder, resorting to increasingly illegal and sketchy tactics to insure that he gets the perfect shot and the highest cheques. Literally everything about this film is flawlessly made. The script is tight, the cinematography, which captures L.A. at night, is dark and beautiful. Jake Gyllenhaal is the standout. There's just something slightly off and creepy about Louis's physicality but it never descends into parody or caricature. The supporting cast is fantastic as well. Rene Russo is flawless as a cut throat news producer with little ethics. Riz Ahmed is great as Rick, Louis's intern/assistant who swallows his fears about what he's doing for the promise of cash. An auspicious debut by Gilroy, I can't wait to see what he does next.",8,0,0,7 February 2017
Jackie," A cut above
","Jackie is a film that is right on trend with the latest convention of abandoning cradle-to-the- grave biopics for intimate slice-of-life ones. In this case the titular Jackie is Jacqueline Kennedy and the slice of her life we are treated to are the days following the assassination of her husband, president John F. Kennedy. A woman smart enough to know that image is everything, Jackie manages to gather her wits about her enough to fight through her grief and put into place the structure that will ensure that her husband and her own legend, will live on. The thing that immediately elevates this movie is Pablo Larraín's direction which is frankly excellent. He gets a great performance out of Natalie Portman as Jackie, who's surreal version of the real Jackie Kennedy's voice is jarring at first, but becomes less so as the film goes on. The shots he gets are really, unnecessarily beautiful, and by that I mean that a lesser director wouldn't see the drama of the moment or wouldn't use camera-work as inventive, but Larraín always finds a way. His choice for the scorer, Mica Levin, is pitch perfect. It's not the usual staid sort of music but something quite sinister and nauseating, music that unsettles but never takes over. All that said, while the techs were all a cut above the usual biopic the more the film went on, the less I enjoyed it and that was down to the script. It's not terrible by any means, but it goes back and forth and back and forth between a handful of settings/conversations. It's very circular (Jackie wants to do something for the funeral, she faces mild opposition, then whoever opposes her gives in). After awhile this formula begins to sag. Also ironically the fact that Jackie was so successful at keeping her husband's legend alive is what undercuts any tension in the film. We may see Jackie furrow her brow at the thought of her husband being forgotten and worry that she'll end up penniless but we know none of that happened. Still, it's a beautiful film. And though it tries to scratch the surface to give us a little of the woman behind the legend what it really does is further her legend still by reminding us how beautiful, how clever, how poised and how perfect she seemed.",7,1,2,27 February 2017
Arrival," Not quite my taste
","I really wanted to love Arrival. I'm a fan of so called 'smart' sci-fi, stuff that manages to bend out of this world stuff with beauty. Arrival was one of those movies that seemed to tick all the boxes (female led, prestige cast and crew) but I found myself a bit let down. The movie is about Louise Banks, a university professor of languages who we first meet in the opening frames of the movie as her she takes care of and raises her young daughter, only to lose her when she is still very young. We then see Louise at her job when 12 alien space ships land at an assortment of random locations around the world. Because of some earlier work she did translating for the military, Louise ends up getting assigned a job helping the army translate and talk to the aliens (quickly dubbed heptapods). Louise and her partner Ian end up becoming close to the two heptapods that try to communicate with them, and they struggle to figure out what to say and how to say it before the trigger happy government attacks the aliens and starts a war they might not win. There's a lot to admire about Arrival. Amy Adams is great here as Louise (sadly snubbed for an Oscar despite the film receiving multiple nominations). The tech work is also very good. This isn't a movie that goes for intensely gorgeous visuals, but there is still eye-candy in the form of the written version of the alien language. The central story and the 'twist' at the centre of it is really great too, and it's only something that will enrich the film in multiple viewings. And yet despite the intimate story there was something about the film that just didn't work for me, primarily the nitty gritty details of the script. Despite the elegant structure and ideas there's some dialogue that's too quippy and on the nose and there's this whole section in the middle that is just five minutes of information dropping voice-over over montage. It's a weirdly lazy technique for a film that sweats the details. There's also a relationship that ends up being central to the ending and the plot that I never quite bought and doesn't feel organic at all. Your mileage may vary. While I never quite succeeded in feeling that emotional connection that would have elevated the film from good to excellent I can see from the ratings and reviews that others just don't have that problem.",7,1,3,27 February 2017
Wonder Woman," Wonderful
","Wonder Woman was always going to stand out. In a huge burst of superhero fervor that's lasted for decades it's the first time since Elecktra that a superheroine has had her own movie and it's the first time since Punisher: War Zone that a woman has directed a superhero movie. Combine that with the fact that it's the first superhero movie starring a woman to be directed by a woman AND the fact that despite being an iconic and beloved superheroine it's the first time that a live-action Wonder Woman has made it to the big screen you have a movie burdened down under the weight of some heavy firsts. The good news is that even among so many game changing stats Wonder Woman holds it own simply as a movie. I love action movies but I don't go to too many. Simple fact being that between the cheesy, often lazy dialogue, the blurred action scenes that go by way too quickly to even understand what's going on and the terrible to non- existent characterization, it's often not worth the price of the ticket. But Wonder Woman has a great script and is lovingly directed by Patty Jenkins. This may only be her second feature film but Jenkins has spent the time between this and her 2003 debut film Monster handling big budget TV pilots and cutting her teeth behind the scenes on small studio shorts to test whether she was superhero director material. Is she ever! Wonder Woman is a introduction to WW the character and, aside from two clumsy bookends, pretty manages to stand on its own as a movie. It tells the tale about how Diana, princess of Themyscira, grows up on an all female matriarchy. Sheltered by her mother, the adventurous Diana defies her orders and trains as a warrior under the guidance of her aunt. Her peaceful existence grinds to a halt one day when Steve Trevor crashlands in the waters of the island. After she rescues him and ascertains he's a man, the island is attacked by WWI German soldiers who bring with them guns, which the Amazons have never seen before. Horrified by the consequences of this weapon Diana decides to go with Steve to do what she was trained to do and stop the war, reclaiming peace and love for mankind. That's the gist of the plot, which doesn't sound that great when I put it down in writing. Trust me when I say that the world building and characterization really amp up the value of this simple story. I had my doubts about Gal Gadot, who plays our titular Wonder Woman, but she truly steps up to the plate and inhabits the role with oodles of charm and grit. This is a Diana who is naive but not stupid, kind hearted but determined, who is willing to go the extra mile and do the right thing because that's what she believes in. The other characters are really wonderful and charming too. Chris Pine is given a lot to do as Steve Trevor but he is a good and ultimately supporting player to Diana. Lucy Davis kills in a tiny role as Etta Candy, Steve's secretary. Out of all the Amazons Robin Wright really sticks out as a fierce warrior who is clearly having the time of her life in a really epic battle scene that I wish had gone on even longer! Trevor's crew of misfits, despite being given little screen time also have their own unique traits and values and Jenkins, the actors, and the screenwriters succeed in making you care for them over their short amount of screen time. Ultimately while this film is about two and a half hours long the time just flies by. It's elegantly paced, and if anything could have done with an extra half hour to fully flesh out the end. I gave it an 8 as a rating, rounded up from what would be a 7.5 if IMDb allowed half stars. Why not higher when I'm full of praise? Ultimately though the film is charming there are some bones to pick here and there with the film. Nothing that detracts from it being an overall great experience, but not enough to boost it to a higher score. And ultimately, as fun and as charming as the film is, it doesn't really do anything to reinvent the wheel. It is a simple story beautifully told. It's just a pity that more action films aren't able to meet the bar of being decent. Definitely give this one a watch. You won't be disappointed.",8,6,14,23 June 2017
