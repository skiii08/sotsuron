Hereditary," First-time director Ari Aster offers up scary movie which gives us all the delicious pleasures of big-screen fear, along with a killer lead performance.
","First-time director Ari Aster offers up scary movie which gives us all the delicious pleasures of big-screen fear, along with a killer lead performance from Toni Collette. When the matriarch of the Graham family passes away, her daughter and grandchildren begin to unravel cryptic and increasingly terrifying secrets about their ancestry, trying to outrun the sinister fate they have inherited. Described as an Exorcist for a new generation, Milly Shapiro plays the young daughter who suffers a grizly decapitation, and Gabriel Byrne plays the husband and father who spontaneously combusts. Theres a lot going on in a complex plot which stands up to repeat viewings.",7,1,3,18 March 2019
Sleepy Hollow," A horror film, but it's a Tim Burton horror film, make no mistake about that.
","Tim Burton directed this 1999 adaptation of Washington Irving's 1820 short story 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow', and his trademark gothic fantasy imagery influenced by Hammer Horror films is also over the production. Even Christopher Lee makes a cameo appearance. Johnny Depp plays squeamish police constable Ichabod Crane, sent from New York City to investigate a series of murders in the village of Sleepy Hollow by a mysterious Headless Horseman, who decapitates his victims in the woods. Christopher Walken plays the ghostly rider, and the strong supporting cast also includes Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, and Michael Gambon. Despite never going beyond the thrills of the obvious, Burton keeps up the pace and tension throughout the film, aided and abetted by Danny Elfman's dramatic score and some remarkable visuals. This is gorgeous filmmaking that brims over with fun-house thrills and ravishing romance.",7,0,0,18 November 2019
The Exorcist," The movie that launched a new era in horror films
","One of the most profitable and controversial horror movies ever made. When young Regan (Linda Blair) starts acting odd (levitating, speaking in tongues) her worried mother (Ellen Burstyn) seeks medical help, only to hit a dead end. A local priest (Jason Miller), however, thinks the girl may be possessed by the devil. The priest makes a request to perform an exorcism, and the church sends in an expert (Max von Sydow) to help with the difficult job. There were reports of viewers fainting or vomiting in theatres when this was released in 1973, such were the reactions to scenes such as its young protagonist undergoing a realistic cerebral angiography and masturbating with a crucifix, and of course theres that head spinning showstopper. But behind the sensationalism is a strong storyline that deals with a lot of issues. The famous theme music is the piano-based melody which opens the first part of Mike Oldfields Tubular Bells.",9,0,0,19 March 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is Tarantino's fun, haunting homage to the summer of '69
","Quentin Tarantino's ninth feature film features a large ensemble cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie. It is set in 1969 and is a fun, haunting homage to the Hollywood of the time. Invented characters rub shoulders with people who really lived (and live), non existent movies and genuine TV shows co-exist, and real life history swerves off into an entirely fantastical alternative universe. The movie caused controversy by portraying Bruce Lee (played by Mike Moh) in a negative light. Other cast members include Damian Lewis playing Steve McQueen, Rafal Zowierucha as Roman Polanski, and Damon Herriman appears briefly as Charles Manson, a role he reprises from the second season of David Fischer's Netflix series Mindhunter. Look out too for Al Pacino, Kurt Russell, Luke Perry, and Bruce Dern. It was the first Tarantino film not to involve Bob and Harvey Weinstein following the sexual abuse allegations against the latter, and was a worldwide hit grossing $374 million at the Box Office, with critics praising its screenplay,direction, acting, cinematography, costume design, production values and soundtrack. Too bad it's overlong running time and lack of proper narrative make it feel like an over indulgent exercise in self-gratification at times.",7,0,2,10 March 2020
Midsommar," Twisted folk horror with a wicked sense of humour that will disturb you.
","A group of American college students who have never seen the Wicker Man travel to Sweden to visit their friend's rural hometown for its fabled midsummer festival, but what begins as an idyllic retreat quickly devolves into an increasingly violent and bizarre competition at the hands of a pagan suicide cult. Ari Aster's follow up to Hereditary has been described as both a 'Wizard of Oz for perverts', exposing the rotten heart of western civilisation, and a bad trip comedy (the hallucinations the characters experience while tripping on magic mushrooms are some of the most realistic ever portrayed on film). Midsommar is an ambitious movie, impressively crafted, and above all unsettling, further enhancing writer-director Aster's credibility as a horror auteur to be reckoned with.",7,6,8,11 November 2019
A Clockwork Orange," A much-maligned and misunderstood classic, that is one of Kubrick's finest movies
","In a futuristic Britain, a gang of droogs led by Alex (Malcolm Mcdowell) run rampant, commiting rape, muggings, and beatings galore. Eventually Alex is captured and subjected to experimental treatment to cure him of his anti-social tendencies, and released back into polite society. Based on a 1962 novel by Anthony Burgess, A Clockwork Orange is the darkest of satires, exploring the deepest of themes: behavioral conditioning, crime and punishment. The director withdrew it from release in Britain for inspiring copycat crimes, and it remained unseen until his death. The end result also is a lampooning of youth culture as well as of those who espouse 'law and order.' It has achieved cult status as a result of its stylish cinematography, and mesmerising score by Walter (later Wendy) Carlos. Bring on the ultra violence!",9,0,0,19 March 2019
Joker," You'll never look at Batman's arch nemesis in the same light again
","Todd Phillips (The Hangover guy) wrote, produced and directed this origin story for the Joker character from DC Comics 'Batman.' It features a powerhouse performance from Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a clown for hire by day, and a wannabe stand up comedian at night. Suffering from a medical condition that causes him to laugh at inappropriate times, Arthur finds that the joke always seems to be on him. Caught in a cynical existence between apathy and cruelty, he makes one bad decision that brings about a chain reaction of escalating events in this gritty character study. Phillips's film is a rare beast, a comic book movie which non comic book fans will probably appreciate more. It pays tribute to the 1970's and early 80's films of Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro (who appears here as a manipulative TV chat show host), particularly King of Comedy and Taxi Driver. Hildur Guðnadóttir composed the the film's score, which she wrote simultaneously alongside the music for the TV miniseries Chernobyl. As well as original music, it features the songs 'That's Life', 'Send In the Clowns', 'White Room,' and controversially, 'Rock and Roll Part 2,' by convicted child sex offender Gary Glitter (who did not receive a penny In royalties)",9,5,8,18 February 2020
Beetlejuice," A visually inventive and snappy comedy that pokes fun at the afterlife
","When newlyweds Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis die in an automobile accident, they end up in limbo and are forced to haunt their old house as ghosts for the next fifty years with only a copy of the Handbook for the Recently Deceased to help them earn their wings and enter heaven. Unable to scare obnoxious yuppies Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones out of their old property, they enlist the help of yellow haired, snuggle toothed, profane, flatulent 'gonzo' bio-exorcist Beetlejuice (played by Michael Keaton in a raucous and hilarious role originally intended for Sammy Davis Jr). Winona Ryder is the teenage goth daughter of O'Hara and Jones, always dressed in black who Beetlejuice falls in love with and tries to marry. Tim Burtons movie is a riot of invention that pokes fun at the afterlife, and won the Academy Award for Best Makeup. Just over one million of the fifteen million dollar budget was given over to visual effects, which include stop motion and replacement animation, prosthetic makeup, puppetry and blue screen. A critical and commercial success, the film spawned an animated TV series which Burton, producer David Geffen, and music composer Danny Elfman were all involved in, a video game and a Broadway musical.",7,0,1,24 March 2020
