Miracle," awesome movie
","in my opinion, miracle is one of the best movies ever! to you all it may not be, because your older and have seen many more movies. but miracle was a great story, and they did an awesome job filming it! they also did a wonderful job casting the hockey players, knowing that some of the hockey players weren't actors. and Kurt Russel did an excellent job playing the big role of Herb Brooks.the wonderful true story of the miracle on ice in 1980 turned in to a very exciting film in 2004. after every time i watch it i am cheerful, and thats because the ending is just so exciting and i imagine myself there 25 years ago, and how i would have felt. well, to most of you miracle might be a 'good' movie. but to me, its the best damn movie ever!",10,1,1,4 September 2005
