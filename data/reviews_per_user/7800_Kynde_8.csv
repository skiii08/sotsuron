The Blair Witch Project," Disappointing. Boring not Scary!
","I had heard so much about this movie both good and bad, so I had to see it. I'm just happy that I didn't pay for it. Because even though it only runs 80 min, it feels like two hours. Nothing happens and because it's filmed by hand held cameras most of the time you can't see or hear anything. Blank screen! Maybe if you believed that these film students really died, and that they where killed by a real witch, it could have been scary. But since this is obviously not the case, because the Blair Witch legends was invented for this movie, this is not a factor for me. Some of the people I saw it with was very scared, when I was bored? They at least had some fun out of it. Except for the last three minutes nothing happens!I think it was a great stunt, to convince America that this was a true story, and the best thing that came out of this movie, must have been all the stuff on the net. That the only commercials was on the net was very smart. I guess that if I and a lot of other people don't like this movie, the creators will probably cry on their way to the bank with all their millions.I gave it 4 out of 10 for it's new thinking alone. The movie in it self is worth nothing.",4,0,2,26 November 1999
Casablanca," A masterpiece
","There is not much to say. Everything good about this movie has already been said. I have just seen the movie for the first time, and had expected that my hopes where set too high. They were not. Bogart is playing so well, and delivers his lines as good as it can get. Ingrid Bergman is stunningly beautiful and plays so well up to Bogart. What can you say, this is film when it is at its best.",10,1,1,12 April 1999
Shakespeare in Love," It's a mystery. How can they make such a good movie?
","I must say I was impressed. With 13 Oscar nominations you are sure to put your hopes too high! But not this time. It is funny, romantic and tragic all at the same time. Like Shakespeare always is. The acting is great. Joseph Fiennes is great as the man himself. Also the Oscar nominees are good: Gwyneth Paltrow is playing her best part so far. She might deserve the Oscar. Judi Dench is fantastic as the Queen. And Geoffrey Rush is very funny. But everyone else are also playing great. There are a lot of funny things to notice. It is funny to see Judi Dench playing Queen Elizabeth, when she have just played Queen Victoria in 'Mrs. Brown', (Where she also was nominated for an Oscar.) It is funny to hear Geoffrey Rush use the phrase 'It's a mystery' again. Last time it earned him an Oscar as David Helfgott in 'Shine'. And it is funny that Joseph Fiennes' last part was as Queen Elizabeth's lover in 'Elizabeth' (Where Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett) is nominated for an Oscar for her performance. It seem like Finnes is bringing out the best in actresses.) In my opinion the only competitors for Oscar for best film are 'Life is Beautiful' and then of course this one. So now all we can do is wait until Sunday for the results.",10,0,0,18 March 1999
The Revenant," Boring, way too long and I did not at all get involved with the characters
","Having just watched Iñárritu previous and fantastic movie Birdman again, and knowing this film was nominated for 12 Oscars my expectations was very high, despite the fact that the trailer made the movie look boring. I thought it was just a bad trailer. But no; this long long movie is boring from start to finish, and when the movie ends I could not care less who lived or died, so even in the grand finale I did not really care how the movie ended. I'm so disappointed. I really hope it will not get any Oscars, and feel so sad that a great actor like DiCaprio probably receives an Oscar for a part, where most of his lines are grunts, instead of for one of the many great movies he has made prior to this one. But I guess he will win because he deserved to have an Oscar already, and this is how the Oscar often goes when great actors have been overlooked.",5,1,2,10 February 2016
American History X," A rough but great movie!
","This is one of the roughest movies I have seen. It takes you through all the emotions. I cried and laughed, and then I cried again. In this movie we are shown the most terrifying murder that I have seen on film. It really felt like someone put a knife in my guts, and turned it around. This is the only reason, why this movie should not be one of the best. On the other hand, it could also be another reason for it to be even better, because it dares to show the main actor doing such a terrible thing. And even though you know he did this, you learn so much about him, that you later in the movie forgive him, because he changes, and at the end, he is almost a hero in your mind. When I read the comment of Ari NY on the main page, two days before I saw the film, I thought that he most certainly overrated this movie. But now I have to admit that he was right. I wouldn't say this is the best movie I ever saw, but it's up there with the greatest. And I agree with Ari that Edward Norton deserves the Oscar as best actor compared to Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan. I haven't seen all the other movies so I can't say anymore about that. But I can say: 'Go and watch this movie on the big screen, but be prepared for the roughness.'",10,0,0,4 March 1999
National Treasure," Feel good movie - a modern version of Indiana Jones?
","As I had read in other reviews on this page I felt that National Treasure was a good way to spend two hours, without demanding too much of you, but nevertheless giving you a happy feeling.It is not a deep movie in any way, and neither tries to be. But it is fun, there is lots of action and there are riddles and plot turns etc.If you liked Indiana Jones (and who doesn't?) then you will also be able to like this one. It is not as original, but it is a great update of the Indy adventures set in the pre WW2 area to our days. Cause you need a great idea to make a realistic adventure and treasure hunt in the present USA. And it works.Go see it, and have a great time.",9,0,0,31 January 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," The second best movie of all time.
","What is so great about this movie? The question should be: 'What is not so great about it?' And the answer would be: 'Nothing!'The story is good, and the outcome is not obvious but great. The acting is superb all over the line. Tim Robbins is Andy Dufresne and we suffer and feel joy with him. Morgan Freeman is magnificent as Red, and when he is narrating it is like chocolate to the ears. He has so many great lines, most of which are quoted here, because they are worth remembering, like this: 'Prison life consists of routine, and then more routine.' The music by Thomas Newman is fantastic. It soars over the movie giving it the right mood, sad many times but it always fits in. I have just seen this movie for the fifth time, and it keeps getting better. I'm looking forward to seeing it again, when some time has passed. I know there will be something new to notice which is another reason why it is so great. I haven't talked to anyone that didn't like it, and with the number one spot on IMDb's top 250 most people must like/love this masterpiece. I haven't found any flaws in the history, though you can find some errors on the goof list. That Forest Gump ran off with the Oscar that year seems unfair to me and obviously to a lot of other people too.Why only the second best movie? My absolute favorite is and will always be 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.' I like This movie for some completely different reasons, like that I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood, Sergio Leone and spaghetti western. But with 'The Shawshank Redemption' almost everyone I know agrees with me.I hope there will come more movies like this, I hope many more people will see and enjoy this movie, I hope....",10,1,2,28 April 1999
The Iron Giant," How can MAN be so cruel. It makes you cry. 10 out of 10!
","A fantastic feeling. How can MAN be so cruel. This movie touched me very deeply, and I can't remember any other movie that made me so angry and sad about the way humans (can) think.
24 years old, it's a cartoon, and it's 'only' a machine, but at the end when the worst of all things happened I cried like I have never cried during a movie. It has been years since the tears ran like that. I don't think I ever will forget that moment.
I almost missed this movie, because I regarded it as a children's movie, and even though I always go to Disney's cartoon to see the fantastic pictures, this cartoon does not have that kind of drawings. So I was lucky, that so many other liked it, because when I saw that it was in top 100 on IMDb's Top 250 I said to my self: 'Well maybe this is worth watching', and now you know that I think it was.
Before the terrible moment, there are laughs, excitement and all the other stuff that makes a good movie. I loved the scene with the hunters that shoots a poor deer, and then looks up, sees the Giant, and cries out: 'Oh no, it's the monster'. That's so ironic as can be. I think the movie does a good job; it can be enjoyed both by kids and adults. I have already mentioned why adults would like it, but when I just saw it, the rest of the audience consisted of children with there parent(s). I could here that the children liked it. I don't think they really understood what happened in the worst part, they didn't sound scared. And of course, as this IS also a movie for children, it has a happy ending, smoothing out on all the bad things we have just experienced. And that's good.",10,1,2,28 January 2000
