The Benchwarmers," This is for you...
","In the words of Good Charlotte:To every kid whoever got picked last in gym class... this is for you. To every kid who never had a date to no school dance... this is for you. To anyone who's ever been called a freak... this is for you.I loved this movie. Laughed through-out the entire movie, once so hard I almost fell out of my seat. I loved the ending. Very good, good message. Jon Heder is hilarious and Richie's brother is the best freakin' freak I've ever seen.I definitely recommend this movie.-Chelsea",8,0,2,19 July 2006
