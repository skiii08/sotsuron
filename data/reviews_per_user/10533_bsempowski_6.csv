It," Better than the book
","This movie is fairly good, suspenseful and slightly scary. However I overall think that Penny wise is not very scary and his voice is not as intimidating as I thought it would be. This movie is 100 times better than the book however because it removes many of the creepier details of the book such as the sewer sex scene. Overall I would recommend this movie by would never recommend the book because I believe it's 1000 page sleeping pill that's disturbing I will change your opinion of Stephen King. I would highly recommend this movie however I should I would consider it more of a psychological thriller that a horror movie. On the interesting to see what the sequel is like. I would highly recommend this movie if you enjoy psychological thrillers. However if you are expecting a disturbing scary horror movie you will be greatly disappointed. I",5,1,7,26 March 2019
Us," Jordan Peele has created another hit
","This movie is amazing the soundtrack is extremely creepy and well paid for the movie. the fact that all the actors play two characters is extremely impressive. The performance of the doppelg채ngers in this film is extremely creepy and unsettling. The doppelg채ngers also give this movie a very personal sense of horror. You can really imagine your own doppelg채nger following you home with scissors. This really adds to the old psychological terror of this movie. The movie also uses symbols like hands across America and turns them into dark creepy symbols of the destruction of humanity. This movie is amazing and Elisabeth Moss is extremely creepy. This movie will make you think of people smiling and completely new way. The movie also has an amazing twist is on the level of the six cents. This movie does not compare to get out but I believe this movie is super different I cannot be compared. This movie is more traditional horror but demonstrates. Films like this had turned black people from the victims of horror movies into the heroines. this movie also has some hilarious comic relief and multiple dad jokes. the most hilarious part of the movie is when one of the characters asks Alexa like device to call the police but instead it plays a rap song about the police. The compilation this film ensures that you are not scared the entire time. This movie isn't a traditional horror movie instead it's more of a thriller and post-apocalyptic story. Also the film's idea that there's an entire secret underground full of all humanities doppelg채ngers is deeply unsettling. The end this film is amazing and will leave you wanting more. You will also never look at scissors, rabbits, smiles or hands across America the same way.",10,34,79,26 March 2019
The Thing," sci-fi masterpiece
","This is an amazing sci-fi horror movie epic that anyone loves sci-fi horror should see at least once. If you are a fan of H.P. Lovecraft, the 1980s blog, or psychological or I would highly recommend this movie. The practical effects are amazing and is leaving exciting thrill ride them start to finish its way better than modern-day sci-fi horror. This movie questions what it means to be human and explores paranoia. This movie will leave excited until the end. If you are a fan of Cronenberg's other work I would also recommend this amazing masterpiece of sci-fi horror. I have however would not recommend the 2011 remake because it is not nearly as good.",10,0,0,14 February 2020
Split," Worst movie of 2016
",Split is a terrible movie that promotes the idea the idea that people with mental illnesses are dangerous and need to be isolated and stopped before they destroy the lives of people that do not have mental illness. The pacing of this movie is also extremely terrible of the overall plot is pertaining ridiculous. I the movie really began to go hit downhill with the main character changes from someone with mental illness to a strong powerful almost supernatural creature is intended on destroying the lives of people. The movie almost makes it seem like it's better for them to die. This is extremely problematic considering the movie initially talks about having a real-life mental illness. Also the way to dissociated personality disorder is shown is inaccurate and extremely weird. The movie is very inconsistent sometimes it makes you try and feel sympathy for the main character and other times it depicts him as an unstable monster. It's not shopping at the still is terrible because M night Shyamalan is known for terrible movies. He made one good movie and never made another one. Also the ending is weird because his link to a movie 20 years ago.,1,3,10,23 March 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," what's with all the feet
","Once upon time Hollywood is an extremely long movie is extremely dull and boring. It seems like 90% of the first half of the movie is driving the entire scenes, devoted to fictional TV shows and movies, and endless weird shots of women's feet. There's a lot of pointless details and this movie needs a serious amount of editing. Sometimes seems like people forgot what movie they were making and just start filming of Western TV show instead. A lot of the great acting talents are wasted in this movie. The acting is good but the plot line in writing is terrible. Quentin Tarantino also constantly references his other films and is pointless extended universe. The female characters including Margot Robbie's Sharon Tate's are objectified, not given much dialogue, and have their feet prominently shown. In fact Sharon Tate's character barely speaks at all and the only time you see her a male voiceover is telling you what she thinks. This is extremely troubling from a depiction of a female character especially given that Sharon Tate was a real-life figure that was murdered. The murder of the Manson family is also extremely graphic intense and prolonged. This scene also turns violence against women into a joke. The death of the female characters is so prolonged and gruesome it makes you feel bad for serial killers. The movie seems to take joy out of brutally murdering women not to mention that the main character murdered his wife. Quentin Tarantino replaced the gruesome murder of Sharon Tate with the gruesome murder of the Manson family. Quentin Tarantino seems to believe that gruesome murder in his movies is justified that they are preventing another murder. This movie is a piece of trash that turns a Manson family into a boring prolonged joke. Dakota Fanning's acting talents are wasted in this movie at her character squeaky does not play a major role. I believe that this movie has more editing objectify the female characters less and was less gruesome it would overall be better. in the end I would not recommend this to our piece of garbage unless your creepy foot fetish person like Quentin Tarantino. I think it's the worst movie ever to be nominated for an Oscar. In the end I would not recommend seeing it at all costs regardless about what people tell you.",1,2,3,14 February 2020
Black Panther," One of the best movies
",Black Panther is amazing movie that is really worth it. I believe it is one of the best movies in the Marvel cinematic universe it creates a new location that is amazing. The female characters are strong and powerful at the acting is incredible. The costume design is beautiful and the technology is amazing this film. Hopefully this creates a new era of African-American focus sci-fi. I think it is essential that you built you this film. It's one of the best superhero movies that Marvel has ever produced after Capt. Marvel of course. In the end this movies amazing and I believe everyone should see it shows in the future can be bright if we embrace everyone. I love this movie and I believe it is an instant classic that people will be talking about for decades.,10,1,11,23 March 2019
