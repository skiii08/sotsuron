Skyfall," An impressive production of same-as, same-as
","It must have taken an enormous effort to film the chases, the shoot- outs, especially that first one in Turkey (according to the DVD).But the overall story, although very dramatic and full of ACTION is really so ordinary, just like dozens of other films, (ie, Cruise's) and so many others that I've seen recently. ie, initial set-up of 'the problem', followed by numerous chase scenes, and eventually, a great big shooting spree. It gets predictable, inevitable, and rather boring.The best bits (for me), the fancy computer graphics used to trace Bond through London and elsewhere, and I'm curious to know just where that great big bridge at the start is?Judy Dench is great of course, and there is a brief appearance of Albert Finney (Masroy in Erin Brockovich), hard to even recognise.Now I'm tempted to actually read a real Fleming 'Bond' story, just to see if he puts all that shooting in?",7,2,3,24 October 2016
John Wick," hopelessly unreal
","Does this really reflect US? Maybe that explains the tragically high gun crime/tragedy of the whole nation. The people who say its 'Action' are in a different world?Thousands of bullets, scores of dead baddies. Why bother? And the DVD extras don't help, except to show the preparation for the 'fight' sequences. (who-cares?)Wick (Reeves) is coping with the death of his wife (unexplained?) and then receives a delivery of a puppy, apparently from the wife?. Then, another tragedy, he gets tangled up with a Mafia-type crowd from Russia. One of them steals his 69-Mustang AND kills the puppy.Clearly revenge is coming. For 90 minutes. Oh dear.",2,12,19,19 October 2016
Erin Brockovich," Great story, with great casting too. Great directing, acting, production.
","It doesn't take long to realise that this is a great movie. Everything looks so real, and so it should seeing that it is a true(ish) story, but all the minor roles have great actors too. There are lots of instances where little mannerisms make it real. My guess is that Erin wrote most of the dialogue?Besides the real Brockavich, the real Ed Masry comes on the DVD bonus, and shows how good the casting of Albert Finney, and his acting, are and how much he contributed to the successful outcome of EB's efforts. Ed is so tolerant of Erin's apparent disregard for the norms of a legal practice, it is a bit hard to accept that he is for real! But he must have been. Also on the DVD is Erin (the real one) saying how surreal is the 30-second scene where she is the waitress, and then Julia saying that it is about 'inhabiting the concept, not imitating'. So true, and that is what makes really great actors, ie, JR.The story of corporate carelessness and a small-town lady who found out that the water was contaminated and decided to do something about it in spite of heavy lawyers who do whatever the client says, might give others the incentive to do their own action? 'hope so.Although this is a huge legal battle, there is very little of that shown - good idea, courtroom stuff can be so boring and irrelevant. We do see the judge deliver a judgement on a procedural matter, that is all that matters, and the no doubt long legal arguments are ignored all together. Good.",10,6,6,30 May 2016
Fury," 'so very glad I wasn't there.
","No amount of reading war history or personal accounts can match the way 'Fury' displays so many realities of war experience. Whilst some other reviewers complain about clichés, I recognise that clichés or not, this is reality. There is the bulldozer pushing dead bodies, the tank crushing a corpse, the clerk cleaning the inside of the tank after a death, the older crew and their relationships, summary executions, decisions of strategy by the commander, fear, confusion, civilian casualties... and so many more.Brad Pitt's performance is so much better than in (for example) Inglourious Basterds, here, he captures the very essence of his role and seems to almost enjoy doing it. A feature of the DVD shows Pitt looking about 10 years younger than in the movie - does that show just what the make-up people can do? (with hair cement?)Logan Lerman as the typist-clerk suddenly sent to be assistant driver in Pitt's tank is just as important to the feel of the movie as Pitt. Well done.The basic story is easy to follow, a tank and its crew involved in the battles across Germany near the end of the war, the characters are well defined, the acting is flawless, and there are several especially good scenes with memorable dialogue, so I've given it a 9. OK, so the final scenes are not really believable, (is that an LED torch we see?) but by then I've decided on the rating to give it!The section where they meet up with two beautiful young women is so similar to what happens in the totally different movie 'All Quiet on the Western Front', perhaps the writer knew that? Anyway, it was worth putting in.",9,5,8,13 September 2016
Inglourious Basterds," Too many flaws
","It's quite a good story and gripping, enthralling all the way through. It's only afterwards you might realise that it is total fiction even though set in the midst of real events – that gets confusing. There are four main characters. In the order of the merit of their performances, Christoph Waltz plays Hans Landa, a German Army officer who has the job of hunting down Jews in France in 1941. He is smart, suave, and charming, but ruthless, heartless and in the end, devious and scheming in looking after his own neck and wallet. Waltz does a superb job.Equally good is Mélanie Laurent as Shosanna Dreyfus who then becomes Emmanuelle Mimieux, the owner and operator of a small cinema in Paris. She knows about Landa and fears him, and shows it. When Landa leaves, her relief also shows. She is calm and collected as she plans and carries out the dramatic ending. Acting is more than just saying the words of the script, really great actors show in the expression, the emotion needed. Waltz and Laurent both do this very well. Daniel Brühl is Frederik Zoller, a sniper in the German Army who gets a propaganda film made about him that Goebbels want to use. He meets Emmanuelle and tries to befriend her. Brad Pitt plays Aldo Raine, of Apache and Jewish descent. He leads a clandestine band who ambush isolated German patrols, kill all but one of them and disfigure the survivor to send a message to all Nazis. Alas, Pitt is mediocre in this role, unconvincing and sometimes looking hopelessly out of place. He never gives thoughtful emphasis to anything said. Disappointing and perhaps a failing in directing? Other flaws are that they could have done a much better job in finding a Hitler look-alike, and the same for Churchill – Timothy Spall does a better job of that. There are a lot of scenes with sub-titles. If I read the S-Ts, I might miss the actors performance? They conveniently speak English quite a lot. Then there are the hand-written sub-titles to tell us who various characters are, as if we really cared whether Goring and others are in the plot?",5,0,2,15 December 2014
The Hunger Games," Appalling and trite trash
","Totally awful, so lacking in merit that I'm reluctant to rate it so high as a 1.What sort of psychopathic misfits would dream up, write, provide finance for, approve, cast, produce, direct, act in and film such nonsense.There is not one believable character, not one stand-out scene, not one memorable line of dialogue. The acting is consistently ordinary, the faces are expressionless, the location scenery unremarkable. The entire concept is stupid. There is not one even vaguely humorous moment.There is only one way to rate a movie, and that is to see it. No amount of pre-publicity, newspaper articles or reviews can prepare me for the awfulness.Every single person connected with this should be confined to Alcatraz as 'penance', (the eighth word of the preamble, which is so appropriate) for inflicting this on the public.Oh, I suppose the line 'I'll take the bow... I'm kidding' will raise a smirk.",1,6,8,11 September 2014
The Day After Tomorrow," The special effects deserve a 10!
","And the casting is great! Is that Dick Cheney I see? No, it's Kenneth Welsh, and is Al Gore playing the part of President Blake? No, it is Perry King! The first hour shows us a concentrated version of climate change, not next century, not next decade, but... next week! First there is huge hail stones, then a tornado that destroys the 'Hollywood' sign in LA, then a flood that swamps New York, and finally, a dramatic fall in temperature that will turn the earth into another ice age.How can we possibly survive? Most, it seems, don't. Some clear off to Mexico, gosh, won't that be fun? There are distracting sub-plots which don't really add anything to the story, teenagers, a street hobo with a mutt. And minor characters whose role and identity are not clear.Apart from Quaid in the main role, the others are quite ordinary and none of them get really great lines to say. How many times does someone say 'Are you alright?' Too many times, and then Doctor Lucy changes it to 'Are you OK today?' The DVD has 'Bonus Features'. I was hoping they might tell me a bit about how they did the special effects. Alas, it's just guys burbling away about nothing in particular. I suppose getting the Russian ship to drift up 5th Ave is easy enough, but what about when it crushes the bus with its great big bow-bulb-thing?I know it is fantasy and that much of what is shown is artistic license, but I was disappointed.Oh, one great line is when they need heat while waiting in the NY library and so start burning books. Someone says 'More books' loudly. (to put on the fire! including Friedrich Nietzsche!)",6,1,1,2 March 2016
The Prestige," top hat reproduction?
","The first scene shows about 30 hats scattered on a hillside. We learn later that Nikolai Tesla has this amazing gadget, complete with sparks and mini-lighting and then, flash... there's another hat outside? does it also work with cats? maybe humans too? The second scene has Michael Caine explaining and demonstrating how 'magic' tricks are done. First, there is 'The Pledge', ie, something is about to happen, in this case a bird-cage with a canary in it, then comes 'The Turn', where the cage is covered, then smashed, along with the canary, then... 'The Prestige', and bingo, the canary is alive and well... maybe? And the audience (one 7-year girl) smiles and applauds. The inference is that such amazement with accompany all the other magic tricks that ensue.The third scene is in a court room where one guy is accused of murder. Throughout the movie, there is flashbacks, and flash-forwards and if you can follow it all, then good luck to you. I couldn't, I thought the whole thing a waste of the talents of all these big-name stars.In my rating process, it gets 0/2 for the story, 0/2 for the characters, partly because Bale and Jackman are of similar age and stature, and one or both adopt disguises that simply adds to my confusion. The acting gets a 1/2, since none of them can do much with such a pointless script. Then there is a 1/2 twice for the writing, production and direction. Is there a single really good scene, with memorable dialogue? 0/2 Different planets? It takes all sorts?",3,1,5,25 April 2016
Crash," Dramatic, but confusing too.
","There are some really good scenes, and some great lines. But I had trouble trying to follow who was who, and what was going on. It is hard to say what the movie is about. Maybe a line from a voice-over helps, something like 'People here don't talk to each, they crash into each other and then talk'? There are lots of crashes, mostly attitude-attitude as well as physical.There is a nose-tail car incident very early on which is repeated at the very end. It is perhaps supposed to sum up the whole idea? Then there is the good-cop/bad-cop display. The bad cop gropes a woman and then saves her life from a car flip. The good cop can't cope with the bad cop and tries to get transferred, but runs up against ingrained issues at the precinct and later makes a bad, bad mistake, the consequences of which are not explored.How many main actors are there? Many, mostly very good, ie, the locksmith, his wee daughter, the shopkeeper, his daughter, the cop's sick dad, the medical receptionist.Having shown us the complicated side of life in Los Angeles, the movie fails to resolve anything, or am I expecting too much? Probably.",7,0,2,14 March 2016
Notting Hill," Delightful
","The best Julia Roberts film? OK, so I've only seen two others. Here, her character is a famous film star, so it shouldn't be too hard to do? But the acting is superb throughout, and the writing is clever and funny. The support cast are great. Easily a ten.Anna (Roberts) is in London and goes to a street market, there, she gets clumsily bumped into by William (Grant) and he offers to try and clean the orange juice from her T-shirt. And friendship proceeds of course.There is an outstanding performance by Gina McKee as the wheelchair bound wife of Williams friend and other great acting by the publicist and others. But... Rhys Ifans plays Spike, the flatmate of William. Ifans is a great actor, but here, his character is primo-jerk and this reflects badly on Ifans? I don't know why the writers have made him so unlikeable.Something really different and really good is the mini-essay on the subject of why western males are so infatuated by women's breasts. Of course there are plenty of movies that flash a bit of flesh, but nobody ever discusses the matter in a serious way? Here, they do, briefly, and very cleverly. Well done!",9,1,2,9 November 2015
28 Weeks Later," Chaos and disaster and quite scary
","I saw this before (and after) seeing 28 Days Later. While Days was about some individual survivors, (and had lots of silly flaws), Weeks has two strong story lines. One is about the family. There is Don (Robert Carlyle) and Alice (Catherine McCormack) at first hiding in a cottage while their children are safely in Spain on a school trip. The opening scene shows the dilemma that Don faces when threatened with attack. He panics, abandons Alice. Scary, how would I react?28 weeks later, the US/UN army has come to try and rebuild Britain. There are plane-loads of new people coming in, including Tammy (Imogen Poots) and Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton), who are Don and Alice's. When Andy bemoans that they don't even have a picture of their mother, they sneak out of the secure zone and get back to their old house. They get a photo and collect some personal things, then... surprise, Alice is sheltering there.The army helicopters take them back to the medical centre, where Alice is scrubbed and a blood sample taken. Alas, she has the virus, but no symptoms, and so is immune and worthy of serious investigation. The army guys are real and likable (not like in Days). There are tender and intelligent scenes where Doyle (Jeremy Renner) shines. But they have to survive, and what ensues is awful.Now the second theme of the movie takes hold. How does officialdom cope? Containment, isolation, extermination. Code Red. Ghastly.We could think about the wider implications of the threats to civilization that an outbreak of Rage (the virus that causes it all), involve. Something like this. Scary.Superb acting, great writing, but I'm not sure about the wisdom of using a lot of hand-held-camera shots - very hard to follow.",8,1,8,25 June 2015
Ocean's Eleven," Alas, it's all fantasy
","In the commentary by Damon, Garcia and Pitt, one of them points out that in any other town, these people would be the bad guys, but because it is Vegas, and they are rolling a casino, it's OK, and we all applaud! But of course, the casino owners know that too, and that is why the security is so tight and so few attempts get very far (search for casino robbery to learn fascinating stuff!).It is so slick, it flows so well, we know who every one is and what they are doing - mostly. The basic idea is simple, use some 'Mission Impossible' type fancy technology and equipment and then just go. All the acting is superb, and there is nothing wrong with the production and directing. Although lots of goofs have been spotted, they are all trivial. There are also lots of great lines, (check out the 'quotes' section)My problem is in later trying to work out just how they did it, ie, Ocean explains to the others that the $150+M will be split evenly between them, but later, he trades half of it all to get his ex-wife back? Don't ask awkward questions, just go with it and enjoy.",8,1,2,13 January 2016
Saving Private Ryan," Authenticity and realism
","I watched a couple of years ago, rated it 9, but couldn't remember much, so watched it again yesterday, and the extras on the DVD which adds quite a bit to the whole experience.This might seem odd, but I am impressed with the absence of the crude MF language which I have NEVER heard a real person say, and which is so prevalent in a lot of other war movies.The first part, on June 6, 1944, is awful in its realities. This is what those guys went through, and again at the very end, hand to hand fighting in the village. We see the fear and dread in the Jeremy Davies character. My only tiny adverse comment might be about the scenes at the war graves place. The green stuff looks like astro-turf and the head stones look like polystyrene!",9,2,6,11 October 2016
28 Days Later...," So scary, and it might happen too.
","I don't usually click the spoiler button, but have to this time.The story starts with some activists who break into a 'Primate Research' place. They intend releasing the chimpanzees from their torture. That's plausible, but... what are they going to do next? Crate them up and fly them back to Africa? Take them home and keep them as pets? But an attack on a hen research place wouldn't look so exciting? Artistic/Movie licence I suppose.Then Jim wakes up in an empty hospital. Nearly everyone else in the whole country has been infected by the Rage virus that the chimps had. Jim meets Selena and Mark who have some fancy petrol bombs all set up. Very handy when the 'infected' attack. It might seem odd that the infected only seem to attack uninfected people? Oh, but if they attack each other, it would all be over in a few days. Another odd feature is that some of the 'infected' can run like Olympic sprinters, others can barely walk.The infected can sniff out uninfected like mosquitoes can find me? So, when Jim watches a tape of his parents, the glow from the screen is seen outside. In the ensuing attack, Mark gets infected, so Selena has to kill him within 20 seconds. Next, they meet another survivor Frank and his teenage daughter Hannah. Who needs who most? They need each other. They hear a recorded message on a wind-up radio from an army group offering refuge, but it is hundreds of miles away.Frank has a London taxi, so off they go. It seems strange that the only weapons they take with them are baseball bats? And then they find an open, undamaged supermarket. Unlikely since the norms of society have crumbled and 'infected' people cannot do the normal things that make civilization work. It would have been stripped ages ago? Will we go through this tunnel? Dumb idea, there are dozens of bridges over the Thames. The taxi charges through abandoned cars without being damaged? Except for getting a flat tyre. They stop to change the wheel. I wouldn't, I'd go like hell and get out of the tunnel first.Manchester has been burned to the ground - no fire crews to put it out. Scary.At the blockade where the army is supposed to be, Frank gets infected too, so that leaves Jim, Selena and Hannah who now meet the army guys. A Major and eight men. The men are depicted as ill-disciplined, uncouth and stupid. Unreal, but when one threatens to kill himself because the future is hopeless, the Major promises to get women for them all. Ridiculous. The suicide rate in armed forces is unfortunately quite high in normal times, and no one would suggest 'women' would solve that, although the Japanese did provide 'comfort women' for their doomed soldiers. Fat- lot of good that did.Jim of course, sets out to defend the honour of Selena and Hannah, so the soldiers take him outside to kill him, but he escapes and with some help from infected survivors from the city, kills them all.They get in the taxi and crash through the gates. Fine, if the gate is made of polystyrene? Artistic licence again.We were told earlier on that Paris and New York also had infections, but Jim sees a con-trail in the sky that suggests that there is hope after all, so they make a huge banner that the planes will see.And they all lived happily ever after? In spite of the flaws, it's quite a gripping story, and well acted, but there is not one especially good scene and not much in the way of memorable dialogue, so I've only given it a 5.",5,3,4,23 June 2015
Django Unchained," a bit gruesome, and more bodies than a Lee Child novel?
","The truth is sometimes unpleasant, ie, 'Blood Diamonds' (another DiCaprio!), and here we learn about very unpleasant reality (or a re-write of it) of American history. Maybe the wild west really was like this? Django is a slave who gets rescued by a bounty hunter, someone who goes after people (ie men) named in 'WANTED, dead or alive' posters. Then they both go hunting the baddies, and... guess what? Kill them and claim the bounty. And Django wants to find his wife, a slave on one of the cotton plantations of the old South... and guess again, he gets her and they ride of into (or after) the sunset. How sweet. The production, direction and acting are faultless and it is only the awfulness that brings my rating down.",7,0,1,18 April 2016
The Theory of Everything," Interesting and beautiful to watch.
","The basic story is well known now, but here we are told more about Jane (well, her book is the starting point). A brilliant young scholar is struck down by a serious ailment and it given a short time to live.He, and his young love strive to make the most of whatever time they have left. They marry, conceive and bear and raise children. There is so much extra for us all to think about in this movie, ie, How would I cope in that situation, if I was afflicted, or if my partner was? Not as stoically as Stephen and Jane do, I suspect.Credit has to be given to Anthony McCarten for writing the screen- play. We don't really know how much of the great scenes and lines come from Jane's book, but, wherever they come from, they are great.My favourite might be where Jane's mother suggests that Jane should join the church choir, 'So English' says Jane, but goes to the choir, and meets Jonathon. Beset by the pressures of looking after Stephen and the children, and needing and seeking support, she and Jonathon become more than friends.When a nurse comes into the house to look after Stephen, she and Stephen become attached. A post-script tells us that Jonathon and Jane are now happily married. Rather oddly, nothing is said about Elaine and Stephen? Apparently, they did marry, but later divorced.A bonus feature of the DVD is the 'Descriptive Video Service' in which a voice-over explains what is going on. That is really helpful as there are scenes which are not well explained. That's worth an extra rating point! And... I would recommend turning the sub-titles on as Stephen Hawking's voice is a bit fuzzy at the best of times.",8,0,2,21 December 2015
The Imitation Game," Informative and so interesting.
","For me, the best scene, and deserving of a special clip on Youtube maybe, is when they are at the pub, and Helen tells about her relationship with an unknown German.We see, and can almost hear, Turing thinking and realising that this is how he can beat the Enigma. Helen (Tuppence Middleton) (sic!!) is so good, and this is the point after which everything is possible. The worst scene is the attempt to show the convoy destruction. The CGI is amateurish, hopeless!The basic plot is well known now, about how the whole team at Bletchley managed to beat the German Enigma code machine. The story develops well and the acting is superb throughout.One tiny grizzle, is that we are not shown what Joan (Keira Knightley) actually does.",9,5,8,7 October 2015
Pretty Woman," Here is my rather odd observation?
","Richard Gere's character is rich, powerful, successful. So he is used to ordering people around, his lawyer, everybody. He buys companies, strips them for the assets, sells ruthlessly.There is a background story which is only hinted at as he meets a chick, and... How does someone like that form a meaningful relationship? I guess it happens all the time with rich and successful people, the partner (male or female) has to accept, and cope with all that the other one is. The main person has somehow, to maybe come down a peg or three and adjust to the wants and needs and attitudes and ambitions of the other person.We do see a bit of this conundrum in Pretty Woman, but it is a thought that should, or could, be developed a lot more.The special parts of PW is the obvious enjoyment that Gere and Roberts show each other. They must have really enjoyed the whole process. I did too. And I loved the few scenes with Laura San Giacomo... ' Fifty bucks, Grandpa. For seventy-five, the wife can watch.'",8,0,1,1 February 2016
Titanic," Scary, and a realistic semi-documentary
","There are three stories here, all very well written and produced. We all know the basic story of the ship the Titanic, but Cameron's depiction of the actual events is so much better than any written account.We see the captain, we see the doubts as he weighs up the pressures he is under from the ship owners, and the publicity people. Then, later, he has to face the reality that his ship is going to sink and he is probably going to die, probably unpleasantly. And we see the ship's designer and builder. We see the officers and the crew and all the problems they face and how they react. Sometimes well, sometimes not. We see the wealthy first-class passengers and their life of luxury, now they face death and can't do anything about it.The production of all these events is impressive, walls bursting, floods of water, people sliding down the tilted deck, falling off. Then we see the horrible sight of the lifeboats as they search for anyone still living in the freezing water. So graphic, as is the first scenes of the modern attempt to recover items from the wreck, especially the way they explain to Rose what physically happened. Clever.I suppose most viewers will concentrate on the story of Jack (Dicaprio) and Rose (Winslet). But this part, although very well done, is quite ordinary, just another love/lust story. He saves her life, she saves his later. Not many standout scenes or dialogue for either of them.The third part of the story is Rose, 84 years later. The casting by Mali Finn is great. Gloria Stuart is a recognizable older version of Rose and including her joins many of the events throughout the film. Very clever, well done Mr Cameron.",7,1,3,6 July 2015
Zero Dark Thirty," Realistic semi-documentary
","Spoiler policy doesn't apply here since we all know the basic story and how it is going to end... unless one has been hibernating for decades?The merit of this movie is the way the story develops and the way the actors do their stuff. Maya, (Jessica Chastain) is there from start to finish and becomes so real. We can feel her doubts, her frustrations and achievements. It is a fine performance.They (US intelligence) are primarily going after Bin Laden. They have a wall covered with photos of his associates, but they all look much the same - Arabic features and big black beards. So, when a detainee (aka a prisoner held without trial) points to one photo and says 'he is dead and I helped bury him', the trail seems to have been lost. But then we learn that he has brothers and their mother lives in Kuwait - a place where money can buy anything. For the price of a fancy car, her phone and the phone company is hacked. Now the spooks can trace all incoming calls from her sons. But it takes some very fancy technology which may, or may not, be real - it doesn't really matter nor spoil the story. The son, who is known, or believed to be the primary courier for Bin Laden (who won't personally go near any phone nor any normal communication method) is also very careful, never uses fixed phones, always moves around a lot, and doesn't even speak to Mum often.Maya reminds us of the time it is taking by noting the days as they pass on the window of the bosses office. Fortunately for the hunters, the quarry drives a very distinctive vehicle, so they hire dozens of locals to sit around in the streets and tell them when the vehicle passes. And so they see him going to a fortress. Is it Bin Laden's?More fancy technology from satellites and drones help build a picture, but they are still not sure... possibly... probably? And then, should they simply bomb it flat? No, better to go in and make sure they really have got the right guy.The actual raid is a bit hard to follow, well, it was dark (Zero Dark Thirty refers to the time of the raid, 0030). There is some green night-vision footage but it is a all a bit of a blur. Perhaps they could have shown us the Navy Seals doing a daytime rehearsal at Area 51 (which I'm sure did happen), but we get the general idea.A realistic re-enactment of history. Well done Bigelow and all the cast and crew.",9,0,2,26 February 2015
The Shawshank Redemption," great cinematography!
","One can't be involved with IMDb without hearing, seeing, reading such a lot about this 'epic'. It has been top of the ratings since forever, and the user-reviews are superlatives-on-steroids! But can I really have rated 40 or 50 or more that are 8, 9 or 10? Yep! ie - Braveheart, 'Legends of the Fall'.I saw the trailers, and wasn't really impressed - just another US jail pic? So I read some reviews, and saw other clips. Eventually, the local DVD shop had it on a super special, 3 disc set AND the complete script in a book, all for just $5! gosh, the book would have cost that much for the paper? So I doubt if Castle Rock, or Columbia or anyone involved in making it, got a single cent?So I started with disc 3, boring pseudo-interviews with the main actors. Didn't learn much there, and the 'behind the scenes' clip was only 9 minutes and not very informative, so, to disc 2 and eventually watched the actual film. By now I'm a bit overloaded with superlatives. But then thought about the tiny flaws, ie, Robbins as the main character Andy. Insipid, unconvincing? maybe, doesn't come across as either an innocent inmate, nor as a super clever. Norton the warden looks and sounds more like a small-town bank manager and acts like a modern big city corrupt banker? Hadley, the awful captain of the guard looks more like a 'upwardly mobile professional'?The other inmates are forgettable (except Brooks, the OLD guy). The 'get busy living or get busy dying' scene confuses me, that is what I call a 'sillyism'. It means whatever you want it to mean.I note that there is almost zero female participation? Well, it's a jail story of course, not much room for skirts. On my rating system, I gave it a 1 out 2 for the story, 1.5 out of 2 for the character definitions, 1.5 out 2 for the acting (Freeman is great of course), 2 for the filming, I kept noticing the colours and contrasts even in the dull setting, and only 1 more for the directing and production. 0 for special scenes! then 1 more for the dvds!disc 1 also has a commentary by Frank Darabont, which didn't really add much. But he does comment on the question of how the poster got put back up after the escape! 'Get over it, it's movie' True. His chapter in the booklet told everything, including why various scenes had not been shot 'mutatis mutandis' (look it up!)",7,0,0,31 July 2016
The Queen," Nothing much wrong throughout!
","The casting stands out first, just about every character is so like the real person it is like watching a documentary. and what they say is believable too. The queen of course, and the Duke, and Charles, and Blair the new prime minister and his wife. All great.The sad events of the era, the death in very suspicious circumstances of Diana, and then the problems of how the royals react is all here.A thought does occur to me, afterwards, that Blair's ambition to change and improve Great Britain seems to have been lost in the subsequent years. My guess is that Blair will now be regarded as just another...whatever, and who-cares. So much was promised?",10,0,1,14 December 2016
Amélie," Light and fluffy, and very cute, in parts.
","'a bit hard to watch with sub-titles, and French audio, so turn the sound way down. It's about a cute young lady seemingly looking for 'love'? and so she follows some strange events after finding a long-hidden cache of a child's stuff, but then isn't at interested in it's rightful owner?But seeing a guy scratching around a photo booth, and then reassembling the torn-up discards of the many customers, she sees an ad that might be relevant.There are lots of very good support actors, but the story seems to drift a bit in the second half. So, 7 = average in my view.",7,0,1,18 September 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," men, guns, bang-bangs, HEY, this is WAR ain't it so
","If special effects were the only criteria, I'd give it an 8! And isn't it unusual that all the first user-reviews are very negative! IMDb usually puts really positive ones on page 1? But... I expect 1. a story that I can follow without thinking wtf is going on now, so 0/2 2. I expect characters that I can recognize and know what they are doing, so 0/2 3. then there is the acting. Well with so much FX there is not much time or space for the actors to do much more than say the lines, mostly without real emotion, 1/2, then 4. are there any especially good scenes? na, 0/2 Nor memorable lines. Still, with a current rating average of 8.2, somebody must love it all.so, with 1 for the FX and production, and another for the roly-poly droid, that adds up to 3. And here is a challenge, to try and count all the cast and crew! It goes on in small font for ten minutes!My suggestion for Lucas and the Bad Robot etc, call the next one, 'Star Peace', but I won't hold m'breath.",3,13,17,5 June 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," disappointing, stupid and awful
","With all those big name stars, and a topic I like to know about I was looking forward to seeing it all. Not for long though, but I persevered for about 20 minutes, and then saw the last few minutes, and the extra piece on the DVD. Is that enough to be able to comment?Well, it's longer than I've given some other really big earners! Unless I can see what is happening from very early on, they have a problem in keeping me there. They failed. So, why rate it as HIGH as 2? Coz the special effects are impressive.Michael Caine looks better than in some other movies. Perhaps age is making him more mellow, and less brash.",2,4,8,30 January 2017
Braveheart," better than any history lesson !!
","They say one picture is worth a thousand words? Well, here, a million words still wouldn't cover the reality that the cast and crew have put on the screen.When I first saw it a couple of years ago I only gave it a 9, coz I thought Gibson looked a bit too old, but now, I can ignore the tram-lines on the forehead and just appreciate the excellent performance he gives. And, the interesting commentary he adds to the DVD, - explaining the 'mechanical' horse scenes! and talking about the Murron (Catherine McCormack) 'audition'. (I wish that had been videoed, and released!)Of course, I didn't know or care about 13th century history, but here it is, in full colour, and full emotion. With, as Gibson explains, added little bits of drama and humour just to relieve the awfulness of the reality of hand-to-hand combat that was so dramatically displayed.Some people say it is not historically accurate? 'doesn't matter in my view, it is plausible. (except for the final hung/drawn/quartered scenes? that is simply not survivable, but Gibson does explain that what really happened was even worse.I was so impressed with so many of the support cast. McCormack as Murron, so sad, yet that is most of the plot, that Wallace was so passionate that he got his revenge, quickly getting support from neighbouring clans, glens and towns. Patrick McGoohan as the horrible King Edward, Sophie Marceau, Jeanne Marine, Tommy Flanagan (with the Glascow 'smile'!) and his bride Julie Austin too, although only very briefly on screen, such a good piece of writing, direction and acting.England and Scotland, at that time, and for some centuries after, was an awful place to be, full of scheming nobles, treachery, cruelty, civil war - yet somehow, evolution seems to have softened the hard hearts of men?Braveheart is very close to being my 'best ever' movie, so it's a 10 now.",10,2,4,26 July 2016
Contact," The only truly universal language is mathematics!
","I remember the book being so well written and such a great story, but... with a slightly disappointing ending. I can imagine Carl Sagan thinking up the story and how it develops, and then wondering... 'How the heck am I going to end this'.Turning the book into a movie was a great effort and they have captured all the drama and issues and done such a great job on the writing and production parts. The ending is still a bit disappointing, but I can cope with that. The conflict between science and religious stupidity is just so 'American', and it seems that nothing much has changed in the years that followed.I am particularly impressed with the Clinton sections, (even though the movie is set in 1988 and he wasn't Pres then). It shows just what can be done at the Weta workshops, they have taken archive footage, got someone to imitate the voice, then digitally morphed the mouth to get it all synchronised. A great job. I would guess that even Bill is happy with the result.The fact that my own view is that SETI is a waste of time doesn't alter my view of the movie. Other worlds? OK, possible, probable even, but it is not just intelligent life we want to know about, after all, the dinosaurs had some intelligence, so did Abraham, and Mozart, and Shakespeare, Edison et al. It is advanced intelligence we want, with radio telescopes and transmitters. We have had radio telescopes since about 1950, so that means that what I call the 'window of opportunity', is only open about one millionth of its range, or even less, depending on how far back you want to go to say there was 'intelligent life' present. Would anyone really go looking for something with their eyes open just a millionth?But next week... there might be an amazing announcement. Here's hoping!",9,1,4,12 October 2015
The Social Network," Disappointing
","I'm not sure just what I was expecting, but it wasn't this. The DVD cost $5, for a two-disc set! I watched disc 1 last year, rated it a 2 and wrote in my journal - 'can't be bothered to see the bonus features'. Is that fair? So, now I've seen disc two, and rated that a 2 also (and wrote the only (so far) review), then disc one again and then again to get the director's commentary.OK, the acting is good, Eisenberg looks and sounds like Zuckerberg. But Zuckerberg is portrayed as clever, ruthless, manipulating, unscrupulous, devious, unpleasant, dishonest, disloyal ... and yet, he hasn't sued! So, is it accurate? That is not my impression of Mark. (from all sources, not personal of course). Time magazine's Person of the Year for 2010 was Zuckerberg and they were writing the story as the movie was released, and it is mentioned a couple of times in what is otherwise a real hagiography. Zuckerberg's only comment is to question their representation for the motivation for the whole idea of Facebook.But the article doesn't mention the names Winklevoss or Saverin once. Not really a surprise? Here is my advice. Watch the first scene (which took 99 takes to get!), but be warned, you will have to turn the subtitles on, otherwise you'll miss half what is babbled. This must be the worst ever first scene of a movie? Then go to Scene Selection and go to #15 (the second to last) by then Facebook is flying and they go past the 1 million members, it is a huge success. But then we learn that the lawsuit that has occupied most of the scenes from #2-#14 is to be settled out of court and it involves the payment by Zuckerberg or Facebook, of a HUGE sum and another, the details of which remain a secret but is even HUGER.There are times when I was really impressed by the production, and there are some good little scenes, but overall, it leaves a bad memory, and nearly all lawsuit films are *boring*.",2,0,0,28 October 2015
