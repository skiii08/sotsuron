10 Cloverfield Lane," Fantastic, gripping, thoroughly enjoyable, until the final part ruins it...
","I give the 5/10 out of the credit I owe to the original writers of the fascinating psychological horror that takes place inside the bunker. The mystery is compelling: Is Howard telling the truth? Is there any real threat outside? Is Howard a crazy child-abusing maniac? Did he plan all this to own Michelle? etc. I could all go on pretty well had the film ended with the heroine's escape, but then, all of a sudden, what the? REAL ALIENS? Are you kidding me? Just how 'lost' are you Mr. Abrams?! You turned the fantastic, gripping thriller about a deranged paranoid old man into a totally irrelevant tale of worm aliens taking over the earth? The ending ruins everything. The character of Michelle was well portrayed as a woman running away from problems instead of facing them, finally managing to 'grow up' and learn to fight her problems. The ending, however, turns her into a completely different person. From a timid girlfriend, Michelle turns into an alien- smacking badass chick straight out of a classic sci-fi alien flick who blows up a giant alien invader with a bottle of liquor and a matchbox and, not frightened in the least, decides to take the fight to the aliens herself. The movie begins and proceeds as a psychological thriller/drama about paranoia, claustrophobia, and insanity and in a split second turns into the worst moments of the Resident Evil franchise. I literally thought I was watching a remake of the ending of The Thing, with the same actress and all. Great job uncle J.J., you did it again. Had I know he was involved in the plot, I would've thought twice before watching this film. You CAN enjoy this film, just turn if off as soon as the hero goes free. keep watching and it'll turn all the fun you had into utter disappointment, frustration, and resentment.",5,110,143,4 August 2017
It Follows," See what it would be like if one of your greatest fears is realized...
","There are so many reviews here and a lot has already been said, but I'd like to focus on what I think is the core and root of the terror in this film. I can say for sure that the following situation has happened to almost everyone, especially in their childhood: Imagine you're all alone in the house, sitting on the couch. All of a sudden you get one of those paranoid frights that the combination of silence, idleness, and being alone bring. Your eyes turn to the half open door of a room, or to the top of the wooden stairs behind you. You feel a sudden chill. You can't look away. What if someone, or something, comes in through that door or down the stairs? What's it gonna be like? What's it gonna do to me? What will I do? Can I evade it and get out of the house? etc. The fear keeps chewing at your soul until someone finally arrives and you're off the hook. Would you like to see and feel what it would be like if such a thing could become an actual threat, something real, and much more terrifying than you could have imagined? That is something It Follows skillfully manages to pull off. It's a nightmarish ride, slow but captivating. It doesn't shock you with a sudden 200-volt electrical current, but it makes sure you're connected to a low-voltage one throughout the movie. Its against-the-grain approach to the concept of horror gets a hold on you, one that would probably stick with you long after you're done watching it. Sure, the premise might seem to be no different than a clich√© horror flick; a girl infected by a demonic entity transmitted through sexual intercourse, the usual scenario where a couple of teenagers struggle with a curse and go searching for clues to figure out how to get rid of it. It Follows, however, is much more than that. It's like a tiny little bug that's placed on your palm. It appears harmless at first, but while you're unaware, it slowly crawls into your ear and your brain, infecting you with a bone-chilling thought. It's by no means perfect, of course. There are plot holes that might occur to you after you're done watching it, and at times the rhythm becomes annoyingly dull and slow. It's not perfect, but it doesn't need to be. It does what it intends to do quite well, and frankly, with such a budget, it's more than acceptable. If you're into horror of the psychological kind, you will definitely get enjoyment out of this film. If it doesn't happen the first time you watch it, it will probably come to you once you give it serious thought or watch it a second time. Long story short, it's a genuine and admirable attempt at psychological horror, a la Babadook!",8,1,3,4 August 2017
