Your Name.," Best anime I've ever seen
","This is without a doubt my favorite anime of all time possibly my favorite movie in general. The story line has you on edge for the entire show. Plus this movie really gets you in the feels and when it ends you want to watch it over and over again until your finally satisfied. The detail is just incredible, some scenes are just wonderful to look at on a 32 inch tv. The amount of time spent on making this has to be the best use of time in the entire wide world. Now I'm a pretty stone cold guy but this show hits that very small romantic side and bursts it into crazy emotion. This is the longest revie I've ever wrote which should tell you something about how good it is. This show is worth the watch any time over any movie. I give you my word",10,1,2,15 January 2019
