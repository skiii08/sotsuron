Requiem for a Dream," Probably too effective
","This movie is probably the most effective anti-drug statement ever put on film. What watching it proved to me, less than that being a junkie isn't any fun, is that I don't have as strong a stomach as I thought. I've made it through some pretty rough movies, but even those were basically just entertainment. Requiem is a different matter, and is the first movie where I couldn't make it all the way through; after enduring the first hundred minutes,I fast-forwarded through the last twenty. The movie depicts the lives of four people living on Coney Island whose lives go awry due to drugs. Harry Goldfarb, his girlfriend Marion, and his friend Tyrone are already drug users, but as the movie begins seem to have their use pretty well under control. Marion dreams of opening up her own clothing store, while Harry and Tyrone are trying to set themselves up as drug dealers. The fourth character is Harry's mother, a widow who spends most of her time in a dreary apartment eating candy and watching a bad self-help show. So the movie isn't exactly a laugh-fest to begin with. But hold on, it's gets even grimmer from here. Stylistically, the movie is quite impressive. I had previously seen his debut film, Pi, which shares a similar, deliberately grungy look, as well as aggressive editing. I wasn't a huge fan of that film, which at least in my memory seems rather lacking in substance to match its style, but I do remember being impressed by its rapid montage, repeated multiple times, of the obsessed protagonist swallowing pills. For Requiem, Aronofsky elaborates on those sequences with montages of the addicts' drug taking, showing only small details, such as the needle being readied. Working with a bigger budget here, he's able to pull out all of the stops, including split-screen, speed-up motion, and micro-photography, in order to convey the highs and lows of a junkie's existence. But this movie isn't just a director's show; the actors are also very impressive, though largely because of their sheer willingness to pretty thoroughly abase themselves for their roles. This is particularly true of Ellen Burstyn as Sarah Goldfarb, who never flinches from her painful role. Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans manage to make their junkie characters sympathetic enough to care about what happens to them. I never expected that there would be a movie sex scene involving Jennifer Connelly that I wouldn't want to see, but it's here, which may or may not be a somewhat dubious distinction (it was in fact at this point that I decided to skip all the way to the end). Despite its generally harrowing quality, there are points where Aronofsky's willingness to go to extremes starts to dip over into absurdity. A scene where Leto and Wayans encounter a cop and Leto imagines stealing the cop's gun plays more like a stand-alone commercial than a scene in a movie. Another fantasy sequence, this one belonging to Sarah as her mental breakdown begins, literally breaks down the wall between reality and the movie by having her imagine that the talk-show crew invades her apartment. The effect isn't disturbing so much as jarring, by reminding us that we're watching a movie- something that the rest of Requiem, for all of its overt stylishness, avoids to stunning effect. But while the acting and the technical aspects of this film were very good, why I thought it fails is because of the intent behind it. The movie amounts to little more than the world's most extended anti-drug commercial. At some level, I think that all movies should be entertaining; not necessarily fun, but involving and satisfying to the audience. Maybe it's that I'm just too conventional to accept Aronofsky's brutally honest vision, but I think that there's a problem with a film that wants to put the audience through as much discomfort as possible. Instead of telling a story or conveying a mood through the camera, Aronofsky seems to want to use it as a weapon for mounting a sensory assault on the viewer.",4,1,3,15 June 2005
The Birth of a Nation," One of the most controversial films of all time
","This 1914 D.W. Griffith historical epic is a legendary film, both for it's (according to film scholars, at least) pioneering use of narrative techniques and for its glorification of the Ku Klux Klan. It is often credited for defining the 'grammar' by which filmmakers tell stories, and for encouraging a resurgence in the KKK. It's often referred to in reviews as a disturbing masterpiece. To me, on the other, the movie seemed more like a disturbing relic of history, impressive at times but generally more interesting as a piece of history than as an actual story. Perhaps the blame lies with the print's inevitably less-than-pristine condition, but I doubt it. Gone With the Wind, which covers similar ground, may not have been as innovative as Birth of a Nation, but it stands up much better now, even leaving aside the question of racism. Birth of a Nation isn't a bad movie, aside from the racism, but it's also not anything special. The movie first runs into problems in its first half when it attempts to integrate history with drama. Actually, there isn't much of an attempt to combine the fictional story with historical reenactments, at least not until the second half. Griffith just cuts from recreations of famous incidents (Sherman's March, the burning of Atlanta, Grant and Lee at Appomattox) to the fictional characters in unidentified battles. The battle scenes seem to have been a big deal at the time, but, for the most part, I didn't find them to be especially impressive, since the sequences consist mostly of long shots of puffs of white smokes. The second half, which is what has gotten the movie into hot water, at least works better as a story and has more of a focus. The chase and rescue at the end doesn't seem that innovative anymore, but it is still exciting- assuming, of course, that you can overlook what's actually going on in the scene.",6,0,3,16 June 2005
Crash," Absorbing but doesn't hold up to examination
","In Hollywood movies L.A. is most commonly used as just a convenient location for stories that could just as easily be set anywhere. Some of the few exceptions can be found in films like Magnolia and Short Cuts, which explore a web of interconnections between people in ways that seem particularly suited to a sprawling city like Los Angeles. Drawing on these earlier movies, the recently released Crash, which I saw last week at the downtown theater with my sister, concentrates on the specific issue of race. Writer-director Paul Haggis structures the story as a series of racially charged connections between both strangers and acquaintances. Over the course of about 24 hours these characters are all forced towards reckonings with how they deal with race. Haggis has certainly delivered a compelling and well-made movie, with beautifully moody, blue-hued cinematography and editing that is refreshingly controlled for a modern Hollywood film. Other than Don Cheadle, I'm not familiar with most of the ensemble cast, but they turn in excellent performances. Haggis has received some criticism for the coincidences that his screenplay is built on, but I can't say I minded; Crash is infused with enough style as to make it clear that it's not intended as documentary-style realism, and so I was able to accept the coincidences as a Dickensian device for juxtaposing different segments of society. Despite all of these virtues, the screenplay has a number of flaws that ultimately diminish the movie's power. Taking place over about the time of one day, the script has the characters go through dramatic transformations, and while some are justified by the story's dramatic intensity, others, particularly those experienced by a rookie cop and a black TV director, are overly schematic and unconvincing, turning flesh-and-blood characters into pawns in the director's grand scheme. The movie contains several scenes of the characters placed in harm's way that some viewers might find manipulative and overwrought but which I found to be legitimately compelling; there is, however, at least one too many of these moments. One of the difficulties in making an ensemble film has to be keeping the different characters' stories in balance; because many of the characters are set up as protagonists, and not as supporting characters who nudge the story along, there's less leeway in the editing room for removing subplots and tangents that don't turn to work. In Nashville and Magnolia, for instance, there were several characters who had obviously fallen prey to the need to keep the movie to a manageable length, rendering their function in the story more or less incomprehensible. Here, the character of the DA's bitchy, racist wife, played by Sandra Bullock, doesn't prove to be very interesting. Moreover, the crisis that befalls her and prompts self-reflection- she breaks her ankle falling down the stairs and is helped by her Hispanic housekeeper- comes right after several more intense scenes, including a car crash and an armed confrontation. At this point I began to get the feeling that Haggis was just piling on one catastrophe after another. The way in which Haggis keeps the issue of race throughout the film is less than subtle- in every single scene he contrives to have the characters discuss racial issues, so that after a while the movie starts coming off as an after-school special with four-letter words.",2,1,8,16 June 2005
1941," Spielberg's would-be comedy
","Spielberg's famously disastrous comedy is kind of like the Heaven's Gate of comedies. Not because it was one of the expensive debacles that came out at around the same time (which it was), nor because it's as bad as Heaven's Gate (it isn't). The main link between these two otherwise dissimilar films is how they are both overwhelmed by the scale of their productions. Though Michael Cimino and Spielberg both produced films that were undeniably impressive as spectacles, somewhere along the way they forgot to also make films that would be, respectively, exciting or funny. Of course, Cimino had probably decided that it was beneath him to make a movie that would be 'merely' exciting. Obviously making a Western was just too lowbrow for the maker of The Deer Hunter. 1941 doesn't possess anything close to the suffocating pretentiousness of Heaven's Gate; in fact the opposite is true. Both movies are equally stupid, but at least 1941 knows that it's stupid. Spielberg does actually try to fulfill the requirements of the genre he is working in, unlike Cimino. The problem with 1941 is how clearly you can see Spielberg trying to be funny. Comedy is like dance; it doesn't work if you can see the effort. The filmmakers' (especially Spielberg's) mistake was in thinking that physical destruction on its own is funny. Because of this approach, we are treated to the sights of: a tank crashing through a paint factory (and then a paint-thinner factory); a Japanese sub shelling an amusement park; a man trying to hit the sub with an anti-aircraft gun blowing apart his own house; the whole house falling into the ocean; and much, much more. What Spielberg and his collaborators seem to have forgotten is that destruction, however absurdly over-scaled, generally only works as the punch line to a gag. In Used Cars, which shares with 1941 the same writing team, Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis, one of the funniest scenes involves one of the used-car salesman wrecking cars on his rival's lot. The scene works because of the salesman's demented spiel, while the destructiveness serves only to cap off the scene. In 1941, however, the human element gets lost amid the epic scale. The cast is impressive, but the actors seem to have been selected on a sort of rabbit's foot-type theory- hey, if we cast famous comedy stars or character actors, their talent will sort of rub off on the movie! John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd appear as, respectively, a crazed pilot and a pompous tank commander. Both of them seem to have been hired on the assumption that anything they did would be funny, without much thought as to how they might fit into the movie. Belushi, who is particularly out of place, does his shtick from Animal House but not nearly as funnily. Tim Matheson is also called on to reprise his role in Animal House, but not to much effect. John Candy plays a racist sergeant, which is apparently supposed to be funny in itself. In addition to then-current comedy stars, Spielberg also enlists a gallery of famous character actors. Warren Oates plays a Dr. Strangelove-type commander, and does not display any previously untapped knack for comedy. Elisha Cook Jr. shows up for about thirty seconds to get shot at by John Belushi. Slim Pickens is put to better use, as a drunken lumberjack who, in the movie's funniest scene, encounters a group of Japanese sailors and tries to chop them down with his ax. (Ironically, and incredibly, this scene was cut from the theatrical version, perhaps on the basis that what audiences really wanted was more scenes with Bobby Di Cicco). Robert Stack and Toshiro Mifune as, respectively, General Stilwell and a Japanese sub commander, are the only actors who emerge with any dignity intact. Stack also gets the movie's second funniest scene, tearfully watching Dumbo as a riot rages outside. The movie's visual scope is undeniably impressive. The sets are huge, while the costumes and props are characteristically impeccable. And I can't deny that part of me thoroughly enjoyed seeing all of this luxurious period detail get systematically trashed and destroyed, not to mention wasted on such a gleefully moronic movie. However, even on the visuals Spielberg and his collaborators shot themselves in the foot. Spielberg and his cinematographer, William Fraker, chose a fuzzy, smoke-filled visual style which generally just makes the movie look out of focus, when 1941 should have looked as bright and sharp as a Looney Tunes cartoon.",5,0,1,16 June 2005
Once Upon a Time in America," Leone's masterpiece
","As with all of Leone's films, America displays a fastidious concern with detail in its sets, costumes, and props. Leone's concern, however, is not with strict historical realism, but rather with creating a sort of heightened reality. Though his movie is a gangster story that takes place in small-scale or squalid places like opium dens, tenement buildings, and crowded delicatessens, production designer Carlo Simi gives everything a touch of opulence, a larger than life quality. And I mean 'larger than life' quite literally- as has often been said about Leone's work, America's sets, while often evocative and convincing in their individual details, as a whole are grandiosely overscaled, so that the interior of a kosher delicatessen on the Lower East Side appears as large as a train station, and an opium den supposedly hidden in the back room of a Chinese puppet theater (with, according to Leone biographer Christopher Frayling, Indonesian puppets performing an Indian epic) has people on cots stretching up the ceiling. The epic quality of Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West lay more in their style and physical scale than in the movies' actual stories, which are rather slight. Leone placed his characters against the background of vast historical movements and events, but he didn't focus on the powerful people causing or at least marshaling these events. On the contrary, much of the larger than life quality of his heroes and villains came from how they seemed to exist outside of society and normal human concerns, like, as writer Danny Peary pointed out, a more-than-human race of warriors doomed by the advent of civilization. Gangsters, of course, don't stand outside of society so much as they infiltrate it and corrupt it, and Leone adopts to this difference with a comparatively restrained style, particularly for his actors. Still, little remnants of his spaghetti westerns remain in his interpretation of mobsters. One important difference from The Godfather is that Leone's gangsters are not bosses- they do their own dirty work, whether it be smuggling, union racketeering, or murder. They're still outlaws more than figures of authority, and the main source of contention between Noodles and Max is the latter's decision to hire the gang out to 'the Syndicate,' as represented by Joe Pesci's mob powerbroker. In interviews on the film Leone spoke of the Prohibition era as the second great era of frontier lawlessness in America, which makes no sense from a historical point of view but works beautifully from a pop culture perspective, which of course is the point. Leone puts an almost touching faith here in the viability of genre as a means through which to filter his epic vision of twentieth century America. The childhood scenes are like a wicked, R-rated version of Our Gang, with the pint-sized crooks exhibiting a strange innocence, displayed most memorably in the famous cream pie scene. But already this innocence has begun to curdle into amorality, into an unthinking amorality and disregard for others. Leone sympathetically and amusedly dwells on their battles with the buffoonish, corrupt neighborhood cop, known as 'Fart-face.' These scenes have a particularly Our Gang-like quality to them, depicting clever and precocious outwitting stupid and cruel adults. The first of the gang's exploits that we see, however, consists of them burning down them the news-stand of a man who has refused to pay protection money to the local boss. The kids watch excitedly through a grille as flames devour a man's livelihood before his eyes as if they were watching a show put on for their own amusement. All throughout the film, we see people watching other people at a remove, particularly men watching women. Noodle is the ultimate spectator, often silent, constantly watching others, desiring women he can't have, observing events he can't control, seemingly vanishing for extended periods of time (first for eight years, then for thirty-five,) to reappear in an America that has gone on without him, among people who have gone on without him. At least 2/3 of the film, and possibly the whole film, occur in his head, in flashbacks to his past, so Noodles can watch his own life unfolding like strips of film in a projector. Early on, we see patrons watching an Indonesian shadow-play in the theater that fronts for the opium den where Noodles hides from the world. The silent audience outside and the stoned customers within taken together are like a Janus-faced portrait of a movie watcher, subsuming their daily lives in the play of shadow and light on a screen in a state close to dreaming, or drug-induced hallucination, or even death.",10,13,32,30 September 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Not great, but a nice conclusion to the series
","One could spend a whole day going over the reasons why The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones were such train-wrecks, but one of the most obvious problems was George Lucas's basic reason for making them. Instead of existing in their own right, these movies were made to set up a story that had already been told, filling in the gaps of the complicated back-story. For all of the noisy effort and expense put into them, Episode I and II seemed perfunctory, as if Lucas was making them basically just for the sake of symmetry. Episode III benefits from the start from having a real sense of direction and purpose. The story of how Anakin Skywalker was corrupted and became Darth Vader is much more interesting than wars between obscure alien races with bizarre names. In the weeks before the movie came out, rumors were floating around the Internet that the playwright Tom Stoppard had done an uncredited re-write of the dialogue. If this is true, then I can see why Stoppard wouldn't go out of his way to associate himself with the script. Like Episodes 1 and 2, the acting and dialogue are sometimes atrocious, and rarely less than stiff. Hayden Christansen, who plays Anakin, comes off as particularly inept, but since almost no one manages to give a really decent performance, perhaps most of the blame should be placed on the shoulders of George Lucas, who obviously doesn't really understand how to work with actors. Lucas's attempts at lacing Revenge with political undertones are as muddled as the Jedi philosophy, which is particularly incoherent in this installment. At one point we are told that only Sith think in terms of black and white, which might have been meant as a jab at Bush but comes off as nonsensical in the context of the Manichean system on which all of the films are based. And if the Jedi are supposed to let their emotions guide them, then why is Anakin warned that passion will lead him to the Sith? For anyone who hasn't already caught on, this movie will provide conclusive proof that Lucas, whatever his merits as a filmmaker, should not be taken as a great philosopher. I don't think that should at all be held against him; what bothers me is that he tries to include philosophical points in the Star Wars films anyway. For all these faults, I found Revenge of the Sith, on the whole, to be a satisfactory conclusion to the series. It succeeds where it is supposed to: as a spectacle and an origin story for Darth Vader. Lucas kills off Count Dooku too quickly, considering that Christopher Lee is maybe the only non-digitally generated actor who seems comfortable in this trilogy, but the future Emperor proves to be an effective villain; his methods of seducing Anakin to the dark side of the force are considerably more subtle than those he uses on Luke (which basically consist of saying over and over again, 'Embrace your hatred and you will come under my power!') Where the movie really takes off, however, is when Anakin, caught in a confrontation between the Chancellor and the Jedi leaders, finally does turn to the Dark Side, beginning with a Godfather baptism- style massacre of the Jedi across the galaxy. At last Lucas has delivered an action scene where we have a real emotional stake in what happens. He concluded The Phantom Menace with a technically well-filmed light-saber duel that nonetheless fell flat dramatically because the participants had no personal grudge against each other but just happened to be on opposing sides. The moment where Yoda turns the tables on his would-be assassins is almost satisfying enough to make up for this dull climax. By now it's a meaningless cliché to praise something for being 'dark,' but these scenes have a real dramatic intensity that the new trilogy had been lacking. Lucas, however, goes a little too far in his desire to be 'dark' when, in one of the most talked-about moments in this sequence, Anakin decides to kill a whole group of children in a Jedi training school. The scene ends before he actually does anything, but it's still a pretty bold scene for the series that also introduced Jar Jar Binks to the world. Maybe a little too bold; the scene comes early on in Anakin's conversion to evil and too quickly pushes him beyond the pale. Of course I knew, as did almost everyone in the theater that night, that Anakin was going to turn into the incarnation of evil, but Lucas should have made this change from asshole to evil incarnate at least a little more gradual. As it is, the long-awaited confrontation between Anakin and Obi-Wan lacks some the power it should have had, since there's not even the possibility that Obi-Wan can pull his student back from the Dark Side. Lucas does a fair job of setting everything up for the real first movie, even managing to explain the presence of R2-D2 and C3-PO, which in Phantom struck me as a cheap, crowd-pleasing sop to the fans. The series' storyline is still riddled with holes, but that shouldn't bother anyone who has realized by now that Lucas never had a real overarching plan, but has really just been winging it for over a quarter of a century. But for all of my misgivings about the Star Wars series in general and this entry in particular, I couldn't help but be moved at Sith's conclusion as familiar images appeared- of Tatooine's twin suns, of the druids in the gleaming white halls of a spaceship, and of Darth Vader standing menacingly on the command deck of his battleship- bringing the story full circle.",6,2,4,27 October 2005
