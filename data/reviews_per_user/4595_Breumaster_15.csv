Blade Runner 2049," One of the most boring SciFi-Movies.
","I like good and bonding SciFi-stories, but as the first 'Blade Runner' this movie is similiar. It has it's moments, but on the long way to the end it's to long-winded. It sure is a good movie for having a nap with special sounds in background. But i feel, the whole storie is dull. I thought that when the first came out and it's like a dejavu, feeling the same by looking the following part. Beside the dull story, there are logical errors, one can't fail to see. I'm glad to not have spent time in cinema. I just rented it from Amazon and that's enough for me. If there was an urgent flow in the plot, i could turn a blind eye. But so I hold the opinion, that 'Blade Runner 2049' is just over-rated. This should be nearly as good as 'Alien', 'Interstellar', '2001'? No, sure not! :(",6,6,11,20 February 2018
It," A new era of horror. Pennywise goes CGI.
","Skarsgard is a mind-blowing new Pennywise. In Comparison with Tim Curry, he is much more subliminal. The old 'It' sure is cult and has it's own charm, but the new one, which is made exactly 27 Years (hint!) after the TV-Movie, is well done about the parts the old movie-production could not portray/depict. But the new Pennywise Shows a freaking grimace, with blood-freezing effects. Creepy feelings predetermined by watching this clowny freak and his cabinet of freaky phenomens the Kids are facing in the movie.I like the thing, that the movie concentrates on the kids and does not such time-jumps like the TV-movie. So this is only the first part. an second part will follow, the producers announced. But we have to wait. They want to do this before the kids are to old, because the sequel allegedly will tell the story from grown-up point of few from the former kids and obviously tell the rest of the story in flashbacks.In the new 'It', there are many things told better and more clear to view, but one thing is worse than in the old movie. ... I would rather have seen more quality in figurative characterization of the kids, like in the old movie. But that's the only point of critic for me. The new 'It' starts a new era of horror-movies - it makes them socially acceptable. Greeting.",9,3,5,8 October 2017
Knives Out," It slightly reminded me on the old Agatha Christie movies, but with more fun.
","An old family patriarch dies by murder and on this situation arises a cluedo. A secret person consults the well known detective Benoit Blanc, which starts to untie the knot of relations of the millionaire family in that high house. He gets help by the service maid of the dead patriarch.I guess this one will be in the top 10 of crime comedies at the end of the year. 'Knives Out' has some fine humor in it and leaved a smile on my face at the end. I like the style that tells the story very clear and hides the turns perfectly. There is also some fun in it - the whole cinema laughed strongly at some points. The cast is wonderful. Only near the end there was a scene, which was a little awkward, so I set my rating one star lower. But all in all it's a very good movie and we were well entertained by a worthy movie.",9,3,7,12 January 2020
Ready Player One," Get ready for some action! ;)
","When I saw the trailers, I completely underestimated the movie's relevance. This film leads you into a mix of virtual reality and reality. First I thought, this is maybe the first time I will be disappointed by a Steven Spielberg movie. But I had a feeling, that I should give it a try ... and I did. That was a very good decision. It's definitly a movie for the big screen because of many opulent pictures - there is much to see and admire. :)It's the story of a VR-Mogul, who invented the 'OASIS', a VR-world, where everything can happen. All the world joins the Oasis for mostly the whole day. But the maker is gone and want's to pass the Oasis posthume to somebody who is worthy, someone who is responsible. So the whole world starts to hunt three special easter-eggs from the owner, and solve riddles to become the new owner of the Oasis, as the main character does. There are also a few sidekicks that make the story very interesting.'Ready Player One' is a very fluent told story about the dangers of being online all the time without a raised indexfinger. This movie is all about the chances one can take and friendship, to team up with friends and covering friends. With it's 2 hours and 20 Minutes, the movie was so stuffed with action sequeces that make sense, but not only that. Over the whole movie there are hidden hints from the 70's till today, many strong pop & rock-songs from the 80's, and many allusions to earlier games and Anime-Characters. The audience is bombed by hints and things, that let us remember earlier times, when we were young. And now our kids do the same. So it's a perfect movie for modern families. :DIt's for fathers and mothers, who played with game-consoles when they were kids. It's for kids, who will love this version of online-world and friendship-story. So the whole family can discuss the dangers of being always online without demonizing the online world we have today. And I can say that I was perfect entertained over nearly the whole movie. So why giving it only 9/10 Stars? It has one mediocre logical error in a key-scene that catches the eye. I can't tell what it is without spoiling. If that wouldn't have happened, i would have given it the full 10 Stars. I like the message of the movie. :D",9,1,2,11 April 2018
Interstellar," 'Interstellar' is in my personal Top-Ten-List!
","Not just an space-adventure. Insterstellar is so much more about human beings and taking chances, and good decisions under bad conditions. It's about love and despair. I can not tell anymore without spoiling, so the rest of my review is about things like cut, cinematography and so on. And the cut is perfect! Switching between earth and space-scenes would destroy nearly any movie in it's flow, but with the continuity of the perfect score through this scenes, it doesn't break the storyline. It goes hand in hand showing what happens simultaniously. And that shows great dramatics. Great done! The story is one of the best i've seen so far. The cinematographer did very good shots through the entire movie. The actors did great work! Looks like another Oscar for McConaughey. The score is perfectly supporting the atmosphere. There is no reason for me to give less than 10/10. And that's nearly an insult! OK, here is one point in which the movie could be better ... it should be 240 minutes long, not only 169 minutes. ;))) Greetings. :)",10,4,10,9 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Nice Looks, Poor Story
","The visuals of this movie are really spectaculary. It has some laughs, action and really is designed for the big screen. On the other hand it's timewise long winded and cheesy. It could have last half an hour less and there wouldn't miss anything. I state it's entertaining, yes! But also to highly raised in advertisement. If there weren't that much cheesy moments, filled up with the old characters - just to put them into the movie - I would have been more amused. I wish the whole franchise had a more dignified end.",7,1,8,11 June 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Worst Tarantino ever.
","He needed about two hours to do his usual bloodbath. And that two hours were the best of the movie. The more I watch of his movies, the more I get the impression that his writing lacks to the end. I got the impression, that he doesn't really know how to end a story without being violent. I guess this is his recipe. Tell something, show some feet in-between and then the bloody showdown. To watch his movies was much more nice at 'Pulp Fiction', it was much more nice at 'Kill Bill' and even at 'Inglourious Basterds', but does it ever have to be 'the same' end? I'm bored by always seeing his brute force and violence fantasies in variations. He has no surprise in his movies, at the end it's always the same. He, who is called a genius surely should be able to do better. But I must admit, that I had to laugh strongly at the Bruce Lee moments.",6,5,10,6 January 2020
The Lion King," Simba has grown up. :D
","I think it sure must be a lot of brain work to imagine how the real scenes in Afrika will match with the animations. Jon Favreau, which I do admire for his works, did a real good and visionary job, and so did the camera department and the animators. I really liked the little changes that show a more developed story than the full animated original. I would give it the full 10/10, if there would have been a better dub in Germany, because not all of the voices did fit. Scar's voice was way too soft. But that's not the only voice. When it came to the sequence with Timon and Pumbaa, it really got very strong and had funny moments, I didn't expect. If Walt Disney could see it, he would be delighted. For most of his 22 (!) Oscars he was awarded for animal documentations. This movie unites both worlds of cinema - fictional animated and dramatized story with landscape documentations. I like how the animals look and specially how they move! The story is all in all the same.",9,6,9,27 December 2019
1917," A Jouney Through the Scenes of World War I
","Two soldiers got the oder to bring a message to another companie. It should prevent that 1600 men run into the enemies trap. On that Journney, the two soldier face indescribable cruel and disgusting situations. In this movie one can feel with the very authentic and sympathic characters of the two soldiers and it feels bad for sure. It also shows how soldiers must cut out the impressions of war, because they have to survive. So they can't be sidetracked by the dead bodies all around. And it's also not filmed with a raised pointing finger.It's not only the often mentioned one-take-style in which the movie is filmed. It also has a complete authentical production design. All I saw looked very real from the clothes over dead bodies to the explosions and fighting scenes. That makes the walk of these young guys a high suspension travel through the abominations of war. The dialogues are suspense-driven, the camera is great, the sound fits in every second. Great done! Big movie! A MUST see recommendation!",10,13,21,9 February 2020
Midsommar," Long Winded, Pretentious, but Not Mindless Horror Flick
","The movie beginns very slow and that's the speed over the whole playtime. When some young people travel to a nativ cult in sweden, they have no clue whats waiting for them. It's a story about a fictional teutonic cult that celebrate a nativ cult ritual, which happens to occur every 90 years. Beginning with some drug intoxication, many people may guess where it ends. This is a very bright and friedly atmosphered horror movie, which becomes bloody, and visually clearly gory in several scenes. The story slowly developes and progresses over the whole playtime. The characters slide into the story deeper and deeper and that's not only because of the acting, the technical aspects of that movie allow the audience, to easily glide into the storyflow. There are many strong visual scenes, that match with a hypnotic score. So the hole movie slows the audience down while telling the story. It didn't really feel like 2 hours and 27 minutes, because I was so slowed down myself.I wouldn't call it a real new invention of the horror gere. There are some pretty good horror movies that formerly were made in Scandinavia. 'Midsommar' is not really an excellent movie, but also not mediocre. I've seen a bunch of compareable movies before. 'The Wicker Man' from 70's dealt with such a scenario close to 46 years earlier. All in all I like the atmosphere, so it's a recommendation.",7,5,10,14 February 2020
Joker," It's the first time to watch a psychological study about a supervillain.
","I know not any other movie of this kind. It's a psychological look at a derailled supervillain character. I understand why so many people can't cope with it. It's from the angle of the Joker. It shows his story how he is as a mental patient who struggles his personal and goverment induced circumstances. It shows that he is no bad guy in first, but how he changes when time and circumstances grow bad. And the society aspect. How are mentally ill persons are treated by society. That are really strong issues for a movie. The range of emotions for this movie character sure can tend between 'poor guy' and 'stop this guy'. But the movie shows up that nothing happens without a cause. And the acting of Joaquin Phoenix was really big cinema. I like the look of the movie, the flow, the perfect timesetting that didn't change over the whole movie. It's an absolute interesting story for Batman fans. This is the other side of the story, told from the side of the Joker. The end was a good peak for the movie so we went home very satisfied. We would wonder, if there wouldn't be a nomination at the Academy Awards. It's the strongest acting I saw this year.",10,2,3,13 October 2019
It Chapter Two," A Movie That Deals With the Fears of its Protagonists
","According to the first part, this one shows how things from youth or childhood can influence grown ups lifes. It's the second part of the 'It'-remake, which tells the story to end. The youth group of people raised outside Derry and re-untites by a call of Mike Hanlon, the black librarian, who never left Derry like the others. In a time the group is united and now strikes against Pennywise, the clown of their childhood, which stands as a metaphor of the pure evil. They got to push it to the limit for avoiding to fail in a fight of the pure evil.In the old movie, they didn't have the methods to show the evilness of Pennywise, even though Tim Curry did very well. In this part they used all visual methods to show up how bad Pennywise and his 'army of bad beigs' really is. The frachise is took to modern times. It shows themes, which would be unpopular in the 1980s or 90s and also feels fresh. I do like it, it's a recommendation for fans of Stephen King, but also for other horror movie fans.",8,1,2,10 March 2020
The Shawshank Redemption," For me it's the best movie about friendship in bad times and hope!
","The first time, i saw this movie, i had a big smile in my face, because of the excellent ending of the movie. It's a high Quality movie in every sense. I do like that story, the writing is great. I think, the movie is even better than the book of Steven King. The directing is great. The cut is perfect, the art direction is great. The Sound and Soundtrack fits perfect into the movie. I don't know even one aspect, why i should not like it. It's the all time number one for me. That means, it is my absolute first place. The perfect movie! It's a great film about humanity under bad conditions. So everyone can see, that even in bad places is humanity. And even if there are bad People who want to break humanity between others with their might and power, they can't really destroy it. And the movie knocks down facades of deceitfulness. I like that! Sorry, if my English is bad. It's not my mother language. :) Greetings. :)",10,1,1,6 December 2013
Jojo Rabbit," Between Laughter and Crying
","This story touches the heart in a clever way. Everybody can feel with the young boy, who understands Hitler as a friend by not better knowing it. It must be irritating for kids to cope with the circumstances around in such a bad dictatorship. I love the movie - it's great! There were some kids in the audience, asking mother, father, grandfather what happend at some point. So it was a schooling lesson for three generations. On the other hand, it was full of funny gags that showed how crappy the Third Reich was in everydays life. No German could have made this movie. It's good that Taika Waititi did. It was fun to watch. Scarlett Johansson got a deserved nomination at the Oscars. She is great in that movie! Big recommendation for freethinker.",9,7,10,25 February 2020
Godzilla," Well done, but only well done. :)
","I did like 'Godzilla', whenever i saw it, after i saw the first movie as a kid. Then came Roland Emmerich's 'Godzilla' and i found it only 'good'. This new one (2014) is well done, but not more. I write plus and minus of this movie:+Good, epic Monsters, monster-fights and Action. Ken Watanabe Epic Optic Nice effects The Pictures of destruction are epic!-The wife of the hero is a Nurse (that sucks since 'The sum of all fears') There seem to be not many Japanese People in Japan. All the important signs for finding People in Japan are written in English Even the Jet-Pilots in the Japan-section of the movie were no Japanese People. They seem to have no army themselves. There is only a slight difference of Japan and America, because the People everywhere look American. The American soldiers use laughable guns against Godzilla, thats poor! :) In Germany, Brian Cranston sounds the same as Walter White in Breaking Bad. There is no Special Change in the voice, he always Sounds stressed. ;) No good Synchronisation. Cranston has to less screen time. But on the other Hand, when i hear the German Synchronisation, it's better he had not to much screen time. The editing of the movie is awful!Greetings. :)",7,3,7,20 May 2014
