The Blair Witch Project," SOMETHING SCARY!!(May contain spoilers)
","Finally a good scary movie, I mean I've seen some good scary movies but this has to be up there as one of the best. Friends were telling me that it wasn't good but I have to disagree, watch the movie and put yourself in their position and then see how scary it will be, it scares you mentally, after I watched this movie, I couldn't sleep that night. There was some great one liners in here as well. The witch freaked me out even though you never saw her, also to get the ending you have to listen closer when they interview some locals from Blair.",Null,2,3,10 December 2000
Scream 2," A GREAT SEQUEL (WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS FROM SCREAM 1 & 2)
","I saw the movie on video and the first time I watched I was left guessing to who the killer(s) was I mean you couldn't figure it out but then the end came and at first I was disappointed but then I was alright with it but it sucked how the 2 killers werent put in the movie all 2 much especially 'Mickey', I mean he was a good killer and he could take a beating but I believe he should have got more time in the movie, he seemed like a guy that would do all the killings but you just never knew...but I believe he never should've been the killer I was starting like his character and then bombshell his the killer..oh well it happens but as far as the second killer goes, Mrs Loomis, no one would've guessed and I don't care what anyone says it was impossible to even remotely consider her as a suspect. I thought Hallie had a chance of being 1 of the 2, that would've made more sense since she was in the movie more, or Randy would've been alright considering he wasn't in the movie that much at all but he had his good scenes and as far as everyone else goes...nothing much to say except they shouldve killed off Dewey and also should have had Joshua Jackson more involved the movie then just a cameo...he would've been a good addition to the movie and for Buffy well she didnt deserve to be killed off but it happens and they way she got killed was disappointing, why run up the stairs...theres no where to go, that was a downside. But altogether a good movie, maybe not as good as Scream 1 due to the fact that the killers Stu and Billy had better motives well maybe Billy only but altogether a top movie. 9/10",Null,0,0,23 July 2000
