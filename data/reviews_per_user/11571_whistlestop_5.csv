Marie Antoinette," Beautiful and quirky, not just a chick flick!
","Just watched it again( with my husband - his first time) and we loved it. He missed the (in)famous Converse shoes so I rewound for him, but they don't matter anyway, they're just there as a symbol of her 'teenager-ness' (is there such an awkward word? Never mind, you know what I mean!). I love the way Marie Antoinette is portrayed in this film, a young girl thrown into a strange place, with the huge weight of expectation laid on her, yet still managing to retain her feisty character. Versailles is gorgeous as always, when I visited it (before seeing this film) and saw the sumptuousness of decoration I was blown away, you can see how the extravagance would have angered the starving peasants but it's so beautiful! This is a story of two children, too young to be married, too young to rule a country but getting on with it as best they can. The courtship they should have enjoyed was conducted after their marriage rather than before, that's why it took so long for them to become lovers, along with their youth and inexperience. The young Queen is shown to have more depth of feeling than she's usually credited with, as well as her famous love of beautiful things and extravagant spending.",8,0,2,25 August 2008
Troy," So what?
","Troy - sets; superb. Fights; plenty of them, action-packed, realistic. You can see where all that money went. But... I just couldn't care about any of the characters. There seemed no soul to this movie; you can't help comparing it to 'Gladiator' which makes you laugh, cry, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The actors were doing a great job, really, but by the end I just thought, so? Paris is a wet, spoilt weed who should have been killed early and good riddance. And where is the stirring, rolling music that should go with this theme? I can't remember any of it, and it certainly didn't underscore the action as it should. Big disappointment.",7,0,1,8 June 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Definitely better!
","Contains NOT spoilers, but important background info for anyone who hasn't read the book!!Saw this yesterday, loved it - always my favourite book of the five so far. Just wondered WHY they didn't explain the extremely important significance of the identity of the 'Mooney, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs' characters - I thought this was one of the central points of the book, that the marauders map was made by James Potter, Lupin, Pettigrew and Sirius Black when they were at Hogwarts. We were all amazed that it wasn't included.Apart from that, the whole package is better than the previous two films - the kids have matured as actors, although now they look a little too mature to be thirteen-year-olds, and the special effects are just brilliant - loved the Knight Bus, Buckbeak, and Aunt Marge getting blown up, though the werewolf wasn't quite as convincing. Michael Gambon seems to rejuvenated Dumbledore, making him speak faster (thank goodness!) and giving him a sprightly mischieviousness. I loved Harris but this is good too. And that bridge is gorgeous - I want one! Looking forward to seeing it again, and wish that Cuaron was directing the fourth movie too if this is what he can do.",6,0,0,2 June 2004
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Dark and excellent
","It's just not possible folks to put the WHOLE book into ONE film, so lay off the gripes about what was cut etc. This is great - the essential elements are all there, unlike POA which left out a VITAL element, i.e. the identities of Padfoot, Mooney, Wormtail and Prongs (although interestingly Pettigrew is happily referred to as 'Wormtail' in this film). The film is really dark, and scary, and moved us to tears at the end. What more could we hope for? Voldemort is the stuff of nightmares - I'm glad my kids aren't small any more, we would have taken them and regretted it. As it was, we all enjoyed it A LOT and recommend it to Potter fans and non-fans alike. I want to see it again soon.",9,0,1,19 November 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Stirring stuff
","Eagerly awaited, this film did not disappoint. More, more, I cry -they're never too long for me. But why were so many tantalisingglimpses from the trailer absent in the film? I'm looking forward tothe DVD EE to add to my collection - maybe they'll appear in that. Iwas also disappointed that Aragorn's powers as healer and theromance between Faramir and Eowyn were not shown; and ofcourse by the lack of Saruman. The whole spectacle is breathtaking, the music sublime, and the locations perfectlyrealised. Can't wait for the Hobbit!! 10/10",10,0,0,18 December 2003
