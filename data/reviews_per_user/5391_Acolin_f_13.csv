Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Just too much.
","I saw Stars Wars V (the second episode) and so did not expect much from this movie. The computer animation is very good these days (I really like Jurassic Park III), but this movie left me cold, mad and feeling ripped off. I thought George Lucas was aiming for a much younger audience, setting them up for the next one and the next one after that. It was a kid's movie, much like Lord of the Rings. This one is also just too much. Too many characters, with too little depth. Too many scenes with so little meaning. Too many words with so little dialogue.This is a long movie. I got bored with all the action sequences, and I love sci-fi action movies (Commando, Terminator, Blade Runner, 2001, The Rock, Total Recall, Star Gate, The Abyss, Men in Black, U-571, Matrix, Speed, Independence Day, Time Cop). These characters are wooden, except for the engaging Natalie Portman. Nobody gets a scuff on their face. Nobody shows any sign of emotion. It looks like the actors expected their emotions to be added in digitally after they read their lines. The scenes look gorgeously fake. Rich in detail, weak in content.Oh, it was celebration of all things that are Star Wars, of course. The committee that planned this movie didn't miss a single bureaucratic reference to any of the future characters. Hints of upcoming events were subtle etched into the dialogue. Right. As subtly as a whore's lipstick. The new ideas and innovations, such as the rolling fighters in the fourth movie (Episode I) come at you by the dozens, the plot line spins you around good and evil themes like a Ferris Wheel. In fact, the whole thing was one big, noisy carnival ride. Nothing but special effects. It is not a dramatic movie. It is a big costume drama. Think Wild, Wild West or Batman. There you have a good, entertaining, money making movie that people will forget in a few years time.This is not the original. It is not the significant blockbuster that they should teach about in film school. This was not a drama. It is not 'prose telling a serious story' or a 'serious narrative work.' It does not portray 'a dramatic progression or emotional effect.' This is not The Sixth Sense, American Beauty, Cider House Rules, As Good as It Gets, Notting Hill or even the charming Amelie. It isn't even the simple romp of Gone in Sixty Seconds.The sound is as good as you can expect these days. I enjoyed the airplane crash sequence in Jurassic Park III a lot more. Much better use of the medium. Or the ship's horn in Titanic. There was a reason that The Matrix trounced Star Wars IV at the Academy Awards. It is a much better movie.",6,0,2,30 August 2009
United 93," Eerie, like a horror movie
","Online Slate magazine has a pretty good write-up about this movie. (http://www.slate.com/id/2140690/) Except the author doesn't say that watching the events of 9/11 unfold is eerie. It is like watching that horrific day all over again with the clarity of a horror movie. We know what the bad guy is going to do next. We know the innocent, happy girl is going to make a mistake, and despite our inner admonishments and hands clutching the theater seats, sure enough, like an idiot, she opens the wrong door.With horror movies, we have the frustrating benefit of foresight. The director lets us in on the secret. With 9/11, we have the wretched frustration of hindsight.First there is the Discovery Channel's review of the 9/11 Commission Report, which found a damnable lack of foresight, intelligence co-operation and imagination in a defense system that already suffered multiple attacks from the same terrorist organization, including one previous attempt against the very same target! Then there is Thomas Friedman's book, The World is Flat. He details the extensive $400K, multi-team globalization project, which al Qaeda undertook to attack the towers, the Pentagon and the Capitol building.In some respects, this is movie making at its best. Hand held video follows the terrorists through their daily prayers and preparations, nameless, faceless people board the plane amid scraps of conversations and phone calls. Air traffic control centers follow yellow markers on the screen. Bureaucrats shuffle papers and attend meetings. Then one plane is off the screen and nobody knows what is going on. Then another plane is off the air. United 93 taxis down the run-way, preparing for take-off. Four young Arabs sit quietly in first class.Another plane is off the screen. The military is alerted. A plane hits the World Trade Center. The director is clinical about the timing and conversations of the events. His eye never wavers as the clock winds down to the inevitable. This isn't a roller-coaster. This is a grind.Our government doesn't look bad. They just look woefully unprepared. The mother of one of serial killer Jeffery Dahmers' victims spoke in court. She said there was nothing wrong with her boy. Yet nothing, she said, prepares you for a monster like Dahmer.So it was with the military and the air traffic control centers. Although Islamist extremists tried to bomb the WTC before and they successfully bombed the USS Cole, we never met a monster like bin Laden.The director doesn't amplify the courage it took those soldiers of faith to dive head-long into an oblivion of structural steel. He juxtapositions the religious preparations of the terrorists with the last minute prayers of the doomed passengers.And then it is over. You are left alone, in the dark, after a nightmare ride to death. The emptiness and the hollowness of their jihad inhibits you.Unlike Tora, Tora, Tora or the first and second Pearl Harbor movies, after watching United 93, it is easy to see how the schemers and manipulators gave us the war we got. Neither side may be the moral right in this cultural war over globalization and scarce resources, but after watching this movie, you want war. You want justice and you want revenge. I am not sure the Afghanistan war alone would have satisfied our national appetite for revenge.",8,2,5,30 April 2006
Public Enemies," Depp and Bale as Public Enemies
","Depp and Bale as Public Enemies 'But the best rejoinder to Public Enemies is Michael Jackson's Smooth Criminal video, which I watched again after the singer-dancer's inevitable, untimely death. It's a tommy-gun gangster fantasia with a touch of Guys and Dolls, and it's everything Public Enemies isn't: madly inventive, genre-bending, a passionate tribute to the artist as outlaw-loner.'See nymag.com, daily, movies, 2009, 06, The_incidental_pleasures_of_pu.htmlI can not remember so many restless fans at any big budget motion picture as this one. People got up for bathroom breaks, cell phone calls and greasy smelling popcorn.But that is not the story. The story of Public Enemies is not the smooth and stoic good looks of Johnny Depp and Christian Bale either. The story is writer/director Michael Mann.Mann has after all, created some enduring pieces of colloid art. He pitted Tom Cruise against Jamie Foxx in Collateral. He gave us Will Smith in Ali. He exposed Big Tobacco in The Insider with Russell Crowe.But most importantly, Mann brought the heroic epic of great American literary writer, James Fenimore Cooper, to the screen with an incredible performance by Daniel Day Lewis in The Last of the Mohicans.It is that masterful blend of music, courage, Madeline Stowe's good looks and the sheer beauty of a raw, untouched wilderness - all of which are ripe with the potential for a rich, prosperous future - that Mann attempts to recapture with Public Enemies.Billie Crudup, who we saw in Almost Famous, gives a performance as a young, tough J. Edgar Hoover, with ever present Clyde Tolson by his side, which should give a serious notch up in his career.So like Mohicans, this is three grim, determined men striving for their objectives, against all odds, regardless of cost. Unlike Mohicans however, this epic suffers.Here there is no Stowe or wilderness beauty. Marion Cotillard gave a Oscar winning performance as singer Edith Piaf (2007), but her talent is wasted here as Dillinger's girlfriend. With a few exceptions, she just does not have the lines or the beauty to vault this over the top as another extra-ordinary Mann epic.Depp? Of course, he is wonderful. Both he and Bale enjoy long close-ups that should make their agents happy. Yet there are little to endear either the Dillinger or FBI man Purvis characters to us. As Dillinger, Depp is no charming Warren Beatty, for example, in Bonnie and Clyde. We don't see his youth or scenes with his mentor.Same with Bale. Mann uses Bale's narrow jaw to indicate Purvis' resolute determination to catch the bad guys, even if it means using techniques that a modern, enlighten citizenry finds squeamish, possibly immoral. But we never learn anything personal about Purvis. Otherwise, Bale does NOT have a lot of emotion or catchy lines either.Here the musical score does not uplift the tale. It fills quiet scenes with heroic feeling, only to be punctuated with the incessant pop-pop chatter of Tommy-guns. Not even an appearance and song by smooth jazz great Diana Krall can lift the music of this film.Lest you think 'the lady doth protest too much,' this is still a good film. I simply don't think it is worthy of a $10 go-see-it-now on the big screen ticket. Better make it a rental. One where you can go for bathroom breaks, cell phone calls and greasy popcorn without missing much.",6,0,0,30 August 2009
X-Men," the audience is left siding with the evil Magneto
","I am not a fan of the comic book – never read it that I recall. But one of the things that bothers me is the role changes they made in the movie.The professor is abrupt with Wolverine, defending his mind games with gorgeous Jean – which apparently lead her to the dark side of the force. This sets us up for his demise. We are disappointed, especially since new students with new abilities and problems coming to his school would be an ideal setting for continues the series, but not sad. In the previous X-Men movie, the evil Magneto wants the mutants to dominate the world because of their superior powers. This cause is muted in this movie. Instead the evil Magneto is merely fighting for humane treatment of mutants. One can't help but feel that he is right: a majority of mutants will choose the cure (except for those who excel at sports, entertainment and finance) and become normal. Not only that, but he is right about society too. At first, it will pressure young mutants to conform. When they don't and more mutants dominate the lucative industries, society will force the cure upon them. So in this movie, the audience is left siding with the evil Magneto, instead of the democratic Professor.The best of the 2006 movie season may be upon us, for it is far too early for even whispers of what Hollywood contenders for the golden Oscar await us. Three very good blockbusters fill the start of summer for action movie lovers. The only other big action movie left to make the season that comes to mind is the painted face of Captain Jack Sparrow. (Ok, Superman with Kevin Spacey as the evil Lex Luther might be good.) So far each of these thrillers provides the goods. While not better than King Kong or Lord of the Rings, none of them was worse either. They are not too long or too blurry with CGI effects. Therefore, it is hard for me to pick a favorite among them.The superstar status of Tom Cruise and modern weapons of MI3 provides a worldly edge to the first. The fantastic scope of powers and sights provides the hook in the comic book world of the last (think so?) X-Men.Kurt Russell is on a roll, with what two, three movies in a row? This only proves what women know so well. Their shelf life is short. No more so shorter than in the blink of Hollywood's eye, while the staying power of men's graceful aging endures. In Poseidon, Russell and Josh Lucas, whose name I will now remember, give memorable performances in a fresh, gripping remake of the watery adventure.Because some new movie theaters do have larger screens and sometimes slightly better sound than big ole horn systems, each of these thrillers rate 7-8 $s on my dollar scale: worth the price of theater admission. This scale also includes the lower cost of rental, and that is true. I think this trio is worth renting at the video store, but if I were the producers, I would not be rushing them into stores just yet.Ownership? Well, I am not the one to ask. As much as I enjoy the thunder of Master & Commander, Total Recall and U-571 again and again for my reviews, I generally prefer to watch even mediocre new fare over a repeat costing several times the price.",7,0,1,30 August 2009
Pan's Labyrinth," 3 Oscars is only half the story.
","Guillermo del Toro's foreign film won 3 Oscars for 2006, for Best Achievement in Art Direction, Best Achievement in Cinematography and Best Achievement in Makeup. That is only half the story.Look at the nominations and you can see why this is an outstanding film and one of the best movies of last year. Pan's Labyrinth was nominated for Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures/Original Score, Best Foreign Language Film of the Year and Best Writing/Original Screenplay (great story by Guillermo del Toro).Del Toro has indeed created something very special - part war movie, part fantasy, that everyone should see. This is a very 'visual' film that does not rely overly on dialogue. I wish I had seen it in the movie theater. I had none of the why questions. It is much better than the closet tale of Narnia, more compelling and easier easy to watch than Lord of the Rings 2, and yet as political as Schindler's List.Although the young girl's fantasy world juxtaposes her harsh real world, it is not mere escapism. The movie is too shocking for most kids, and some adults. It is not gory, but it is realistically violent. If you liked V for Vendetta and History of Violence, you will like this movie.Like V, the real world dilemma of the plot is simple: good versus shocking evil. Face-to-face fascism in a glance. Submission of good and kind souls. The evil that men do. The young girl and her mother are trapped by circumstances. While the promise of the fantasy world is appropriately extraordinary, the fantasy challenges (tests) Pan's heroine faces are more realistic that the outlandish ones in Lord of the Rings. In Rings, each challenge is supposedly impossible to overcome, yet its group of heroes easily wins and not with special gifts that aid them in overcoming their adversary. Besides, the computer generated graphic images (CGI) fills the screen endlessly with fake backgrounds. In Pan's, the heroine succeeds because of her innate goodness, and yet makes tragic mistakes.Pan's graphics intrude into the stark reality of WWII. In the beginning, CGI offer a glimmer of magic, hope and possibility, which we and the young heroine spy. The tension of the real world drama adds to the movie as the girl moves back and forth between the real world and fantasy land. The tragedy of the real world, and the failings in the fantasy, add suspense, moving the story along and keeping it interesting. In Narnia, there is no interaction between real and fantasy world, the heroes somehow easily conquer and win their fantastic destinies, all in gorgeous and endless CGI packed landscapes.I normally can't watch the audio commentary; it is so full of meaningless crap. Yet the one for this film was as interesting as the one for Young Frankenstein. If you are an avid movie lover, as am I, I found de Toro's references to other movies and techniques fascinating.I've seen a few good movies recently. I also like the wonderful Judi Dench and Cate Blanchette (always good) in Notes on A Scandal, Sharon Stone's incredible and Justin Timberlake's surprisingly good performance in the disturbing Alpha Dog and the fantastic Helen Mirren in The Queen (see the bizarre The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover (1989) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097108/).",10,2,9,30 August 2009
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Silly Clooney parody fails to move audience
","'Stupid' was the first word out of everyone's mouth as soon as we cleared the theater. Three out of four of us thought it was a waste of time. One fell asleep. I thought it was interesting and entertaining. Despite the notable cast, with good performances, of George Clooney, Ewan McGregor, Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey, this is another silly Clooney parody, this time of New Age and creaking Sixties philosophy. It mocks Buddhist legends, paranormal experiences and physic healing. Unlike the Coen brothers' O Brother, Where Art Thou?, this flick has neither the superb music soundtrack, which made that 2000 movie such a hit, or a plot as compelling as Homer's epic 'Odyssey.'Director Grant Heslov is probably best known as The Rock's goofy sidekick in The Scorpion King. He and the two unknown writers should keep their day jobs.",2,6,18,9 November 2009
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Fails to explore the hysteria that gripped the nation
","In times like these, when President Bush is willfully violating one of the founding principles of this country, and reporters are going to jail for not disclosing their government sources (or worse, the newspapers are turning over their notes!), it is appropriate to be thinking of how far wrong is the political right.This movie was considered for an Academy Award, as perhaps it should have been. It tells a story of unbelievable courage, fueled by righteous indignation and some typical misguided liberalism. Edward R Morrow was a voice of compassion and liberalism in a country scarred by war and afraid of the future.Then, as now, they faced a world growing ever smaller with the threat of formidable foes. Then, as now, the knee jerk reaction was to raise fences, throw up barriers, run for shelter and hide under rules, regulations and desks. Yet, this is not the American way. The great American progressive social experiment is one of meeting new challenges, adopting new solutions and succeeding.The plot of this movie stays within the recording studio. It doesn't show what is happening in the world outside of the newsroom. It only hints at the horrors of that day and age. It doesn't depict the attitude of people on the street. Many people supported McCarthy, Nixon Hoover and Cohen. Then, as now, the country was polarized between red and blue states (although I think the colors have changed). In fact, Morrow was incensed because a friend of his was accused of being a spy and then committed suicide. This and many of the other allegations turn out later to be true. Soviet President Gorbachev revealed many Russian secrets in the spirit of Glasnost. There were sleeper moles planted in the US. The Rosenbergs were indeed guilty. Hiss was a spy. So was Morrow's friend.What the movie fails to communicate sufficiently enough was how the basic American principles, upon which this country is founded, were treacherously ignored (not by Nixon!) in the interest of sensationalism and political power. Principles of equality were trampled. The rule of law was set aside. The right of a fair trail ignored. To like communism, attend a meeting or read about it was a crime. Many Jews and liberals were accused of being Reds.Watch this movie after seeing the incredible Schindler's List. There was an awesome enemy out there after the end of the Second World War. Russia shared more similarities with the Axis school of thinking than with the progressive Americans and the allied powers. But as Hussein knows, Stalin was a master politician, even among world-class champions, and he choose to go his own route – an uneasy alliance with the one world power that could help him fend off his aggressive neighbors (gee, sounds like Saudi Arabia, doesn't it?). The world was divided then, much as it is now, between two very different schools of thought.What the movie fails to explore, and another one certainly should, is the hysteria that gripped the nation. We need a movie about the Hollywood 10 (20 really) whose lives and careers were changed because of government prosecution and persecution due to their political beliefs. Even today, we think there is something wrong with people who like communism, instead of respecting their political opinion (and then rushing to outvote them at the polls).In a year of some solid contenders (finally), Good Night and Good Luck falls behind in the pack. Though it is one of the best motion pictures of last year, it does not have the modern intrigue of Syrianna. Nor is Good Night the heart-warming tale, with wonderful portrayals, of Walk the Line. It is not the disturbing performance and tale of Capote. Nor does Good Night have the powerful, emotional-moving majesty of Brokeback Mountain. Rent it yes, but be sure to get the others too.Then, just for kicks, sit down and reread one of the all-time-great classics of courage, compassion, sensitivity, awareness, truth and honesty in the face of public adversity and scorn. Read To Kill A Mocking Bird again.",4,1,2,30 August 2009
Black Snake Moan," Music saves this film: makes stereos sound good
","For men who love music and half naked women and the sexy Christina Ricci, I am surprised that there isn't a post already about Black Snake Moan. The promotion of this 2006 makes it seem like a far dirtier and raunchier movie than it really is. I don't know if even today a black man could keep a white women in his house without a getting a legal lynching, but Craig Brewer's story is a an indelible portrait of the south, poor people and the rhythm of blues that runs both of them.Samuel Jackson is wonderful as the blues playing farmer. Like Brewer's Hustle and Flow, this movie carries an under tone of the importance of music, but in this case, it is not a means to business, but one of expression.It is the music that saves this film. It is the love of the blues that lifts the typical Jackson character, from the strong but good man of the hood out of a simple, but hard life story into something bigger and better, for all concerned. It is the music that makes this more than a simply titillating tale. If you like Ricci's awesome performance in Monster, if you like Jackson's moral men, if you like Oh Brother, Where Art Thou, if you like movies about music, you will like this one too. It sure makes stereos sound good.",7,0,2,30 August 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Non stop metal against metal thumping lifts this convoluted child's tale
","I saw Transformers 2 after I saw Harry Potter & the Half-Blood Prince. Despite Potter 6's $1/2 billion dollar international take on opening weekend, Transformers 2 is the better movie! Shia LaBeouf is a much better actor. He receives and delivers better lines than an insipid Daniel Radcliffe. I suspect the next Harry Potter is the end of his serious acting career. Yet Megan is a Fox! Her overt beauty and 'never get dirty' tight white jeans dominates the movie. As an adult, I prefer the outright sexuality of Megan Fox to the silly childish crushes of teenagers that never kiss.Potter 6 squanders a cast rich with talent, while Transformers 2 milks a few nobodies. Although they never have any lines worth repeating, Transformers uses the compassion of Tyrese Gibson, John Turturro and Kevin Dunn to advance the tale of humans caught between a battle of advanced alien robots. Potter 6 however, kills off Michael Gambon (Dumbledore) and practically ignores the talents of Maggie Smith, Julie Walters, Helena Bonham Carter and the slithery Alan Rickman.Plus, the direction and action of Transformers 2 is better. And its stupid plot twists are just as believable as the magic that infuses Potter. Alien robots that never die is just as believable as evil wizards that never die. In both movies the special computer effects make the entire movie. In Potter, computer generated images create the Hogwarts castle with its rich architecture. In Transformers, CGI creates a mess of metal clashes as robot battles robot. In both, the repetitious computer generated pattern wears the eye down, making the CGI seem like it goes on forever. To its credit, Transformers seems to have a lot more on site scenery with locations in New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Arizona, California, Egypt, Paris and Jordan.Potter was like a magic potion; I wanted to sleep through its poetically slow tale. Transformers 2 was a classic 'bang bang shoot em up,' with high tech weapons. Much easier for me to enjoy. I can't say Transformers 2 is good enough to spend your lunch money on to see it in the theater, but I think only Harry Potter fans should rent this franchise's sixth release. Suspend belief. Ignore the faults. This is no Spiderman. This is Terminator meets Gremlins. Sit back, enjoy.",6,0,3,30 August 2009
The Holiday," Flawed chick flick
","The new girlfriend and I saw two serious flawed movies in the past few days: the JFK memorial, Bobby, and the Cameron Diaz promo vehicle, The Holiday.Director Nancy Meyers wrote the wonderful Something's Gotta Give (2003) with its incredible performance by Diane Keaton, I Love Trouble (1994), Father of the Bride (1991), chick-flick extraordinaire Baby Boom (1987) and the charming Private Benjamin (1980). Yet none of those incredible scripts, insights or performances shine through here.This obvious chick flick movie abounds with feel good emotions, but little ties the viewer to the characters. The Holiday feels like a Diaz showpiece, with slow mo scenes of her running through the woods, while Kate Winslet does the heavy lifting in the film. A glamorous movie about two gorgeous women exchanging beautiful homes and handsome, sensitive men, the movie is worth a 'cuddly on the couch' rental.If you and your sensitive partner do rent The Holiday, be sure watch Winslet. She does all of the acting in the film. Handsome Jude Law walks his blue eyes through the scenes. Rambunctious Jack Black plays his usual, albeit more sedate, self. The camera follows Diaz around as if she is a super-star. Winslet is the only one to portray any level of true emotion.Like a Disney movie, nobody gets their make-up smudged. Nobody has warts  although challenged by the lack of true love in their lives, the female characters are all perfect. Old timer Eli Wallach gives an enjoyable appearance.Oddly, the love stories are not what make this film good. There are some good lines. And a sub-plot that needs further exploration.The leading characters are entangled with bad boy/girl relationships, which threatened to sink their current meaningful and real relationships. This is the sub-plot needing thoughtful exploration, but it is barely mentioned, merely glossed over between scenes of sushi lunches, black Mercedes limo and Diaz close-ups.",3,1,9,6 December 2006
The Thin Red Line," Poetic and philosophical nature clearly sets it apart from other war movies
","From a title, that comes from a poem by Rudyard Kipling, to the opening voice-over to the all-star cast, the poetic and philosophical nature of The Thin Red Line clearly sets it apart from other war moves.The closing lines carry the essence of this gritty conflict: 'This great evil. Where does it come from? How'd it steal into the world? What seed, what root did it grow from? Who's doin' this? Who's killin' us? Robbing us of life and light. Mockin' us with the sight of what we might've known. Does our ruin benefit the earth? Does it help the grass to grow, the sun to shine? Is this darkness in you, too? Have you passed to this night?' Brief appearances by an all-star cast mark this movie as something special. Adrien Brody, George Clooney, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Elias Koteas, Tim Blake Nelson, Nick Nolte, Sean Penn, John C. Reilly and John Travolta all make brief appearances.Though Woody Harrelson and Nick Nolte give powerful performances, to see James Caviezel's incredible angelic demeanor is know why he was cast as Jesus in Mel Gobson's The Passion of the Christ.Yet this story is not a WWII Pulp Fiction. It is more Apocalypse Now meets Flags of Our Fathers. As such, its dreary poetic nature is likely to remain with the viewer long after its green on green jungle fighting scenes. 7/23/2009",7,0,1,30 August 2009
The Ugly Truth," The Ugly Truth about Julie & Julia
","The Ugly Truth about Julie & Julia The Ugly Truth, as Gerald Butler tells us in the movie of the same name is that nobody wants to f**k a woman who dresses for comfort and efficiency. This caveman wisdom, and other harsh realities of the dating scene, are the core of this enjoyable chick flick.The obvious plot revolves around a gorgeous Katherine Heigl, who for some strange reason, is not gunning for the most handsome successful man she can land, except for her face in the lap (literally) of the sexy and hunky surgeon next door. Instead, she is intrigued and tormented by Butler's sophomoric Man Show TV personality. They inevitably get together in the end, but along the way, he manages to educate a smart, sexy and successful TV producer (Heigl) of his wisdom and foresight in all things related to man and women and dating. As if.As if girls at age three don't already know that their looks are important. As if girls at thirteen don't already know that boys are excited more about having sex with them than they are about them. As if a smart, sexy and successful blonde would have any trouble getting the hunky surgeon next door interested in her.With over 30 movies already to her credit, most notably Judd Apatow's Knocked Up with Seth Rogan, actress Heigl seems poised to capture the American 'sweetheart next-door' void so aptly filled by Meg Ryan and Sally Fields.Scruffy Scot Butler (P.S. I Love You) also seems poised for larger roles, though the pair never generate the heat of classic on-screen pairings such as Tom Hanks and Ryan, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn.Nowhere in this movie is the implicit sexual tension that roiled the black and white classics. We don't have passionate couples held apart by thin bed sheets. We don't have headstrong women swimming, perhaps naked, in the middle of the night with men. Instead, we are left with the pithy lines that count as humor these days: Heigl: My cat stepped on the remote. Butler: Well, be sure to thank your pussy for me.This movie is a mindless, but entertaining, dumbing down of what women need to do to catch and hold man's basic desires.In stark contrast to The Ugly Truth are the roles portrayed by both sexes in Nora Ephron's Julie & Julia. Ephron writes romantic comedies, such as You've Got Mail, Sleepless in Seattle, and When Harry Met Sally.In yet another awesome performance by the incredible Meryl Streep (and Amy Adams, both in the wonderful Doubt), we see not just how intelligent, charming and beguiling real, full grown, adult women can be, but also how strong, sensitive, and supportive their real life husbands are. The movie builds from the real life insights of Julie Powell (http://blogs.salon.com/0001399/2002/08/25.html).The Ugly Truth shows that to catch a guy's fancy, women need to be sharp, sexy and a bit coy. Julie & Julia shows that to have an honest-to-god real relationship with an honest-to-god real man, women need to be kind, intelligent, thoughtful, honest and open.Don't have a relationship yet? Then by all means, go see The Ugly Truth. It is a funny, entertaining date flick. Already got a relationship? One where somebody does the cooking, or has ambitions? Then go see Julie & Julia. The first is a fantasy where gorgeous blonds can't get the attention of hunky doctors. The second is two true stories welded together with honesty, compassion, influences of the outside world and true honest-to-god commitments.",6,0,3,30 August 2009
V for Vendetta," Futuristic British world, where the media panders to neo-Nazi thugss
","As I pen this in the balmy days of spring, the tax days of mid-April are still in the rear view mirror, but I am looking forward to baking my body in Florida's relentless summer sunshine.It is 'betwixt and between' time for movies. It is too soon for the teenage, guilty-pleasure blockbuster of summer and the Academy nominees are drifting to the DVD and rental shelves. Nonetheless, for me, the movie theater still beckons.I knew nothing about the V for Vendetta comic book series before seeing the movie. I was quite surprised by it. This is a futuristic British world, festooned with government cameras, where the media panders to neo-Nazi dressing fascist government of thugs.The hero is a dark, Shakespearean quoting knight, wielding a chest full of Japanese fighting swords and a weirdly disturbing, grinning white mask. He saves the girl and introduces himself with a tongue-twisting soliloquy. The hero, V for Vendetta, challenges the government by threatening to blow-up a government building in the British tradition of Guy Fawkes. He is always one-step ahead of the bad guys, wreaking his murderous revenge for their cruelty and corruption.The movie makes a unwittingly, depiction of the madness and inspiration of terrorists. Blow up the building, V thinks, and the public will see that a government trampling their individual rights is more of a threat than their irrational fears (yeah, right).Although I pump my movies through my almost fantastic classic Klipsch Khorn loudspeakers system, I still appreciate movie theaters with speakers lining the walls and stadium seating. These venues are particularly good for action films, my favorite genre being the sci-fi action movie. In this case, it was a delight to wander into the big box and see a late spring entry. If you like the same genre, I think you will like V for Vendetta.The domino scene (where V tips over black and red dominoes to form a giant letter V) involved 22,000 dominoes, was assembled by four professional domino assemblers, and took 200 hours to set up.In the scene where V has Creedy cornered in the greenhouse, V plays Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. In Morse Code, the opening notes of this piece are '... _', or V. This is also the reason for the piece's enormous popularity in England during World War Two. (The Allied slogan was 'V for Victory'.) The Symphony's opening was used as a call-sign in the European broadcasts of the BBC during World War II in reference to Winston Churchill's 'V for Victory'.The name Evey is pronounced EV, with E being the fifth letter of the alphabet, V being five in Latin and Y being the 25th letter (5 squared) On a clock that has an hour hand and a minute hand, the time 11:05 makes a V. These two numbers, 11 and 5, where 11 is November, and 5 is the day of November, spell out: the fifth of November. 'Remember, remember the 5th of November.' The voice-overs about the futility of non-violence and the definition of humanism that can be heard during the end credits are sound bites from speeches given by Malcolm X and Gloria Steinem, respectively.In the memorial for those that died as a result of the virus, the statues are of children playing 'Ring around the Rosie'. There is a frequently cited (though untrue) urban legend that this nursery rhyme was about the bubonic plague.SPOILER: When Evey is being captured by a member of the commando outside Dietrich's house, if we look closer, we can see that the commando member has burnt flesh (it is visible trough the commando mask's hole for the eyes), so it is obvious that he is V. But it is visible only for a second.",10,0,8,30 August 2009
