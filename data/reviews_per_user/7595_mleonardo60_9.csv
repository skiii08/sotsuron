Casablanca," 'Remember this gun is pointed right at your heart...' 'That's my least vulnerable spot.'
","Casablanca is without a doubt a film that gets better with age. It is a film that anyone can enjoy, even though it carries some heavy messages. It is a film that can be watched over and over without the view catching everything it has to offer.The witty dialogue helps make the film timeless, as it resembles a more modern movie dialogue, with subtle phrases that carry a lot of mean.The cinematography is incredible. The lighting sets the mood for each scene n the movie and even gives the viewer an idea of a character's personality. The film will remain an all time great movie and will only get better as it ages.",Null,0,2,10 March 2016
Citizen Kane," Citizen Kane (1941), Orson Welles
","The first feature film made by Orson Welles, it is hailed by many as the greatest single movie of all time. While I may not agree with that statement, it would be difficult for me to disagree. It is one of, if not the most aesthetically pleasing films of its generation. A modern film-maker would be challenged to shoot a movie as beautifully as Citizen Kane was shot, even given modern technologies and CGI.When it comes to characters, one would have a difficult time finding a more dynamic one than Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles). Kane is essentially three different people throughout the movie, and the viewer is convinced of each personality the character takes on.If Citizen Kane is not the greatest film of all time, it could never be ruled out of the discussion.",Null,1,2,10 March 2016
Taxi Driver," Taxi Driver (1976)
","Taxi Driver is a true classic and one of the best films ever made. Robert DeNiro gives one of his most compelling performances as disaffected Vietnam war vet and mentally unstable loner. The film is mostly a character study of Travis Bickle, under the backdrop of NYC in the 1970's. Which was a truly dangerous, but interesting place. In this environment, our main man Travis boiling over in a violent rage is inevitable. Writer Paul Shrader and director Martin Scorsese crafted a very important, unique and real well crafted film that is a classic and influence many filmmakers to come. While there are many movies that have been influenced by Taxi Driver, very few of them are in the same class. Taxi Driver is Scorsese/Shrader's post Vietnam urban American masterpiece that is powerful, gritty and uncompromising. Robert DeNiro is pretty much always great, but this is one of his finest performances and I can't think of anyone who could play this character as well as he did here. I have a lot of admiration and respect for 70's cinema, an era where filmmakers had much more artistic control and had the balls to make movies like this.",Null,1,3,13 May 2016
Apocalypse Now," Apocalypse Now (1979)
","This movie needs to be watched multiple times, it's simply that good and definitely one of my all time favorites! It is by far the best Vietnam war movie I have seen due to its great camera-work. The dialogue is very impressive. But the music used makes some of the scenes in this movie instant classics! Francis Ford Coppola delivered a classic here and makes you feel you're part of the war. Also the famous and nowadays legendary (some still pretty young) actors in this movie brought this to another level.I would definitely recommend people to watch the 'Redux' version (a 2001 extended version of this movie) since it's considered the best version available and adds another 49 minutes of footage left out of the original version.",Null,0,1,13 May 2016
Annie Hall," Annie Hall (1977)
","An amazingly heart felt tale for what it is, in the technical aspects the film is perfectly fine, excelling in set design and the creation of an immersive atmosphere. Following the romantic tales of a smart Jewish comedian falling in love with a ditsy woman trying to get herself straight. After many fallouts the plot comes to a wonderful conclusion, it wraps rather nicely, I'd go into more detail but spoilers are a no- no, so I'll stick to describing it. It's another true to life scenario with how things go, focusing on the complexity of relationships and how much then can go to affect how somebody does things, and how much one can change a person. A good watch for those who enjoy romances, and also to those who can appreciate the deeper plot elements seeded into it.",Null,0,0,13 May 2016
The Graduate," THe Graduate (1967)
","'The Graduate,' to me is a landmark movie. There are so many things that the film does correctly, not just technically but contextually. For starters, the movie seemingly connects the generation gap by a wobbly bridge over troubled waters by introducing sexual relations between a teenager entering his adult years and a fully grown woman with an established life. From this aesthetic quality arose many quarrels during the duration of the plot, which were always filled with tension, and I mean always, even at seemingly calm segments. This, I felt and became anxious as to what was to happen next. Technically, I have never seen a movie of such grace. The unique camera angles and panning techniques utilized really offered many differing perspectives which allowed me to perceive the situations in different lights. My favorite though are the cutting techniques, specifically when facial close-ups occur and then the camera pans out to reveal that the entire setting has changed, and this all happened smoothly. Also the scene where Ben propels himself out of the water onto the raft in the pool only to cut to a scene of himself landing on top of Mrs. Robinson is great.",Null,0,0,13 May 2016
Singin' in the Rain," Singin' in the Rain (1952)
","It is really hard for a musical to grab my attention. Not only did I thoroughly enjoy Singin' in the Rain, my favorite parts of it were the musical numbers. Admittedly, Donald O'Connor & Gene Kelly are magnificent dancers. Make 'em laugh is simultaneously a jaw-dropping routine, and a work of absolute comedy, and their duo dance scene in the voice training studio is unbelievably well done. The one routine that, while also very well made, didn't really fit in, was the one towards the end. Not only did it feel way too long, it was also out of step with the rest of the film.Beyond just the dancing, the film was topical and interesting in plot as well. Even without the music, a movie about the advent of sound in cinema and the differences in acting and performance that came with it is an interesting an original topic to explore.",Null,1,2,13 May 2016
Psycho," Psycho (1960)
","This is a brilliant film. It takes a little bit of getting used to, it can come off as a little corny at first, but once you get sucked into it, the movie is amazing. I believe that is pretty much paved the way for every single horror movie after it. It is a testament to the genius of Alfred Hitchcock. He really understood suspense and how it effects the audience. The Shots in the is film are brilliantly planned out. They make you think exactly what you are supposed to think, until you learn what is really happening. I already knew what was going to happen when I saw this movie, yet it was still shocking. that is what makes it so great.",Null,0,1,13 May 2016
To Kill a Mockingbird," To Kill a Mockingbird (1962)
","Now i think this is a very good movie and a very good book. But just looking at the IMDb rating and the reviews, this movie is clearly overrated. I've read the book and have seen the movie twice. Some very good things about the movie was adapting the book. It was very well adapted and stuck very true to the book. Gregory Peck did a great job as Atticus. Also Brock Peters did a very good job as Tom Robinson. Most people perform pretty well. That's not why this film is overrated. The movie when looking at it close is pretty bland. I mean the movie itself isn't that great. The movie can be slow at points, not all the characters were good (Dill and Mayella). The ending was different then the book and i liked the book ending much better. And overall the movie just didn't have anything special to offer. To sum it up perfectly. Its a good book adaptation movie (for the most part) with nothing great to offer and nothing bad either. I like it, it just doesn't deserve the praise it gets",Null,1,2,13 May 2016
