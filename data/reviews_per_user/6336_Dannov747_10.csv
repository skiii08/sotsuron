Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Phantom Menace retrospective
","Star Wars Episode 1: A Phantom Menace, is almost universally considered to be the worst Star Wars movie. Many even recommend skipping it. Personally, I loved it the first time I saw it. Then I grew up a little, read that I wasn't supposed to like it, and decided that I hated it on my second viewing. I recently watched it a third time, and decided it's far too simplistic to just declare it a 'bad movie.' It deserves a deeper analysis. First thing to get out of the way is that this movie, as part of a 6 movie series and a vast universe, both tells it's own story, and also develops the story of the Star Wars series. It's role in the overarching series plot is to a) show us the characters of Anakin and Obi Wan, and b) show the first steps towards the rise of the Empire, and the downfall of the republic. I argue that the movie actually succeeds in this goal, and also gets some other things right.First, it expands the Star Wars Universe magnificently. It gives us a great illustration of what the Universe was like in the days of the Galactic Republic, with the Jedi Order at it's prime. It shows us the Senate and the politics of the Republic and the structure and function of the Jedi Order. It shows us several different planets and introduces us to several key characters. The main two characters are actually quite complex and developed. Qui Gon is a jedi who does what he thinks is right rather than obeying. He is far more attached the force itself rather than just obedient to the Jedi Code. Obi Wan, despite being his pupil, is almost the opposite. He is strictly adherent to the code. This particular trait will cause a significant rift between him and Anakin in the next two films, so its a good bit of character development and foreshadowing. The backstory and foreshadowing of Anakin himself is interesting, and reasonably well done.The movie also nails it in some other aspects. It is a visual delight. It has a very good sound track, and features arguable the best choreographed Jedi duel in the entire Star Wars series (although that fight really lacks the emotional resonance of the other duels.)But, having gotten the good parts out of the way... It must be said that as a stand alone movie, the Phantom Menace isn't very good. First, the plot... The plot is convoluted, uninteresting and seems to have low stakes. The entire reason for the whole ordeal is to get Palpatine to be a Chancellor, but that's probably lost on the average viewer, and it only makes sense within the context of the whole series. In the movie itself, a viewer will probably wonder why they should care, and quickly lose interest in the Trade Federation, who function as poor villains. Darth Maul is also a poor villain, as he has barely a single line in the whole movie. Next, the side plots. A lot of time is dedicated to the Tatooine side plot. Although it introduced us to Anakin, it was undoubtedly ham fisted and boring. Anakin's relationship with Padme also could have been handled much better. As for the sub plot of Jar Jar's people... the less said about that, the better.The movie is also really not sure what it wants to be. The political scheming and intrigue of the Senate is juxtaposed with the obtuse comedic relief of Jar Jar binks and his race, and that really detracts from building the complexity required for the political intrigue to work. In the end, the movie tries to be too much, and fails to be quite good at anything. Further compounding these problems is the extremely clunky dialogue, the mediocre acting by most of the actors, and the noticeable shortcomings in directing and editing. The comedic relief in particular is extremely low quality, takes too much time, and at times it's honestly insulting. Lastly, the space battles or blaster combat can't really save this movie, as both were quite poor, especially in contrast to the excellent jedi action.Overall, while I think the movie has severe shortcomings that lead to it being below average as a stand alone movie, it nevertheless makes up for some of these shortcomings if we consider its role within the overall series arc. 6/10",6,1,2,28 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack of the Clones Retrospective
","Attack of the Clones is another widely disliked Star Wars movie, and until my most recent viewing, it was my least favorite. I've since changed my view, and I actually consider this to be a decent movie on it's own. It fits into a tricky place in the Star Wars series, as this installment has to show us the rise of the Clone Army, as well as Palpatine's further progression towards supreme power. That's not really interesting in and of itself, but Attack of the Clones actually succeeds in developing the overall series plot, while being a decent movie on its own.It does this by telling a much more focused plot than the first movie. Obi Wan and Anakin are tasked with defending Padme. When she is almost assassinated by a bounty hunter, Obi Wan goes to track down the bounty hunter, stumbling upon both the clone and vast droid army on the way. Meanwhile Anakin continues to protect Padme, and their romance drives that particular storyline.This tighter storyline actually works well. Obi Wan tracking down the bounty hunter to Kamino (where he finds a clone army with mysterious origins being built for the Republic) and then to Geonosis (where we get a shoddy explanation of what exactly the separation movement is) makes for an interesting plot where many mysteries are slowly revealed. And we get to see some pretty good action scenes as well.Anakin's storyline is not nearly as good. His character development here is actually great, and it subtly shows his movement to the dark side. Throughout the movie, he embraces of all the emotions that the Jedi warn against. The weak point is in his romance with Padme. Romance arcs require strong writing and acting to make them work, and this movie just does not have those. At all. It ends up being quite cringey. Earlier on in the story the movie also adequately shows the growing rift between Anakin and Obi Wan. They are both very different characters and the movie shows that really well.The film suffers from some of the same flaws as the first one. Clunky dialogue and some poor acting in particular. The villain is once again elusive, undeveloped and his motives unclear. He is introduced to us only by the brief summary of events at the start of the movie. Since we don't know him at all, the final duel between Obi Wan, Anakin and Yoda against the villain lacks is not very compelling. And unlike the first movie, the action is pretty terrible here, almost downright comical. Overall, Attack of the Clones adequately fulfills it's role in developing the series plot, while being better as a stand alone movie than it's predecessor. 7/10",6,1,2,29 November 2017
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Best in the series
","Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite Harry Potter film. It is the only one in the series that shows the magic of the HP universe while presenting a film mature enough for adults but fun enough for children. Where this film completely beats the others though, is the pacing. Excluding the Shrieking Shack scene, the film never seems rushed. And unlike the films following this one, at no point does a non-fan sit and wonder whats going on. The directors and writers of later HP films trip fail to explain simple plots, but PoA does it with little fuss. Little scenes relevant to the main story appear in between classes, so that the plot keeps moving, something that a film like the Order of the Phoenix, failed at completely. The director in this does very well. The awkwardness present in some scenes in other HP movies is not present here. Scenes are shot through nice camera angles, and the director takes full advantage of the brilliant setting by showing quite a few long shots of the castle. The audio is quite great as well.The acting is an improvement over the last two films, but not great. The only other complain I have is the rushed climactic scene where the trio meet the antagonist. They do a poor job of explaining the twist in the story. One does wonder why the producers spent so much time on classes and then rushed the main part.",9,0,1,4 January 2013
Aliens," Nonstop roller-coaster ride of action and violence.
","This is, in my opinion, the best action movie of all time, and one of the greatest sci-fi and horror movies ever. Almost as soon as Ripley and her crew land on the Alien planet, the action, and the intensity of the violence, hardly ever drops. And this isn't just mindless action, the film expertly builds each character enough to make them more than just alien fodder. The action itself is of high quality, and the periods of quiet in between the action sequences expertly drum up the suspense. Easily the most intense movie I've ever seen.",10,7,9,29 July 2017
The Fault in Our Stars," TIL: Adding cancer as a story theme doesn't make your movie any more interesting or any less shallow
","The Fault in Our Stars is not much more than a cliché romance movie, but with one main difference - the theme of cancer. The fact that both the protagonists have cancer could have given this otherwise atrociously shallow movie some depth, but it didn't. The cancer theme was poorly handled, and despite dealing with such an important and sensitive issue, the movie doesn't rise to anything more than an unoriginal and cliché chick flick. By using it's cancer theme purely as a vehicle for romance, this movie ends up feeling... wrong. It's offensive.See, this movie is essentially like porn for women. The female lead is a girl most girls can identify with, except that she has cancer. The male lead is, as usual with these type of movies, the boy of every girls dreams, except that he has cancer. He's handsome, clever, fit, alpha male etc. Inexplicably, he has eyes only for the female lead (of course) and is a virgin. So it's basically just another romance movie. Cancer doesn't give this movie any depth, but it's poor handling of the sensitive theme does make it more offensive. Oh, and no, kissing where Anne Frank spent several miserable years doesn't make your movie any better, it's just offensive.Normally I wouldn't review this stuff, but this is the most overrated movie on IMDb.",3,3,6,28 August 2016
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Too long for a short plot. Should have been one movie.
","I didn't really follow the development news about this film - The Lord of the Rings trilogy largely satisfied my lotr fandom. So I was most surprised when my friend informed me that the this was only part one of three adaptations of the Hobbit. That confused me, wasn't The Hobbit a relatively short book, with a rather simple plot? Such things can either be thought of as money grabbing or fan service. I think it depends on the product, splitting the final book worked for Harry Potter after all.But in the end, the Hobbit's main problem was the lack of plot development throughout the movie. The film instead mainly relied on dialog and drawn out scenes to fill in its 2 and a half hours. True, the scenery and special effects are brilliant, and the dialog quite clever and witty, but there just wasn't enough story. I firmly believe that as a one film adaption the Hobbit would have been much better.",5,4,15,23 December 2012
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Might have been mediocre if not for the continuity errors and the weak subplots that basically served to shove propaganda down my throat
","Following the Force Awakens, which was largely a rehash of Episode IV, one might have thought that The Last Jedi would be a lot like Empire. While that is somewhat true, The Last Jedi also clearly attempts to take the series in a bold new direction. However, this move leads to two main problems: a) the movie shows a total lack of respect for the previous movies as well as the universe they constructed and therefore has several continuity errors and b) the 'new direction' is not very exciting, nor very new. For one, Star Wars has always had deeply Manichean themes, so the switch to a more grey morality in this movie was not very necessary, nor was it executed well enough. Instead, it just serves to tarnish your old heroes. The new direction for Luke is not very welcome either, as it goes completely against his old character. Other than that I don't really know what new direction all the critics are talking about. The main plot is the same old bad guys have a new secret weapon with a very blatant flaw that can be exploited. However, even this cliche plot was executed horribly. For one, the bad guys have, seemingly, suddenly conquered the entire galaxy, whereas in the previous movie (which was just one day ago) they were a relatively small group of fanatics. Also, way too much time is devoted to two subplots that are just there to shove leftist propaganda down your throat. Don't get me wrong, I am all for subtle commentary in films, even in a Star Wars film, but this was remarkably blatant and a lot of time was dedicated to it.Rey's character remains a Mary Sue. I have yet to see any depth in her character or see any reason to be invested. Kylo Ren on the other hand is the one bright spot in this new trilogy. His character's backstory was developed further here, even though the character still comes across as far too whiny and angsty to be fondly memorable.Overall, this was definitely not an Empire reboot. But it wasn't a very good film either. The plot was uninteresting AND convoluted. Add to that a bunch of continuity errors and little respect for the universe the previous movies had created and it's not surprising so many Star Wars fans dislike this movie. I don't know, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe a few years down the road we will look back on this movie and think, hey this was a great film! But right now, I just can't see it.",2,2,3,27 December 2017
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Sometimes style is more than enough
","Kill Bill Vol. 1 is one of the best action movies I have ever seen. At it's core, it's little more than a typical revenge flick. Our protagonist survives a brutal attack and after waking up from her coma, proceeds to go and kill two of the five people on her list. It is admittedly cliche, and Tarantino doesn't even provide us with the full background of what happened to the protagonist and why (at least, not in this volume). But what's remarkable is that Tarantino is able to give meaning to the action even without providing us with the full backstory. This is because of the characters; Tarantino spends enough time on the actual backstory of the villains and the protagonist for us to actually be emotionally invested. But what really sets this movie apart is how impressive it is in execution and style. Tarantino really perfects style in this movie and makes the action almost like art. Almost every bold move by Tarantino pays off here, and it helps set this movie apart from all the revenge and action movies. You really get the feeling that you are experiencing a master at work, even if the master is doing nothing other than reveling in style and cinematic delight. The music deserves a special mention, it really does drum up the excitement for the action scenes beautifully and is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard in a movie.",9,0,1,29 December 2017
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Christopher Columbus does a fantastic job of bringing the books to life
","The first Harry Potter movie is also one of the best in the series, partly because it sticks to it's source material. Columbus doesn't try to condense the movie to make it more appealing to non-fans but instead pleases the already enormous Harry Potter fanbase with a faithful rendition of the HP world. Columbus should get much praise for the focus on the movie's setting. None of the sequels ever brought Diagon Alley or Hogwarts to life like this movie did. The movie is indeed aimed more towards the hardcore book fans, and perhaps, children, then adults and non-fans. Several parts that could have been skipped were still included to please fans, and the Sorcerer's Stone almost never strayed from it's source material. Scenes like the quidditch scene were not particularly relevant, but helped build the setting and definitely pleased the audience.The casting is great, fans found Hagrid and Dumbledore to be exactly how they imagined them. While Alan Rickman was probably not the Snape described in the books, he does brilliantly. As for the child actors, I've seen better, but they did their job's solidly. The soundtrack is easily the best in the series.Overall the Sorcerer's Stone is a great foundation for the series. It's too bad that later installments strayed so much from the tried and true formula that worked here.8/10",7,1,2,5 December 2012
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Underrated
","In Harry Potter: The Chamber of Secrets, the writers and director again stick faithfully to the book, capturing almost every detail and in the process, make another brilliant movie. The criticism this movie receives has some truth though. At 2 and a half hours long, Chamber of Secrets is one of the longest Harry Potter movies, strange considering it is one of the shortest books. Some scenes could and should have been left out, and others did not have the greatest writing. Also, the soundtrack is for the most part a repeat of the first movie (although for me, that isn't a bad thing, later movies did not match the soundtracks of the first two.) Despite all the faults, Chamber of Secrets does a superb job of capturing the adventure and mystery of the books, perhaps better than any other Harry Potter movie does. While the length and many details could leave some slightly bored or confused, if you approach this movie with enough patience you will have a lot of fun.8/10",6,0,2,5 December 2012
