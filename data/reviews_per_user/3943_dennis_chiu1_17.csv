Blade Runner 2049," A rare sequel that is better than the original (no spoiler of the main plot)
","Film Review: 'Blade Runner 2049' jogs through a jaw-dropping urban dystopia with well-drawn characters and a solid mystery with satisfying results. This film was directed by Denis Villeneuve (Oscar nominated Best Director of last year's 'Arrival') and his steady hand in high concept sci-fi is clearly evident in each frame.The film begins with blade runner 'K', played by Ryan Gosling ('La La Land'; 'The Big Short'; 'The Notebook'), tracking down fugitive replicant Sapper Morton, played by Dave Bautista ('Guardians of the Galaxy'). Morton is an old Nexus-6 replicant, a biologically engineered slave, indistinguishable from humans, with superior strength and agility, who were outlawed after a slave revolt. This initial case leads to information that triggers a larger investigation which is the plot of the movie that I won't spoil.Mr. Gosling gives an astonishing performance that is a wonder of contradictory elements. He gives K an unemotional, quiet, yet dynamic character that is captivating on screen. The other performance of note is a supporting one from Harrison Ford ('Raiders of the Lost Ark'; 'The Fugitive'; 'Patriot Games'), reprising his role as blade runner Rick Decker. With limited screen time, Mr. Ford crackles in every scene. There is still no one that captures an honest, dark, visceral, and physical character like him. The scenes with Mr. Gosling and Mr. Ford together are remarkable, since both play characters that speak more with their silences then when they are actually talking.The concept art, art direction, visual effects, matte painting, production design, and cinematography for 'Blade Runner 2049' will likely be the best I see in theaters this year. While taking inspiration from the dirty, neon, junkyard look of the original, the creative team on this film imagine a new awe-inspiring and expansive world for the plot to play out.At 2 hours and 44 minutes, 'Blade Runner 2049' is a commitment to see, but I do recommend that you take the time to see it, if you see the original first. I say this because, while this film stands on its own visually and in its performances, the background from the original is necessary to fully comprehend the gravity of the plot and the world in which the film is set.I saw 'Blade Runner: The Final Cut' the evening before, and it helped me a great deal with the nuances in the sequel. (The original movie has been re-cut 6 times, most without director Ridley Scott's permission. The original theatrical release was considered by Mr. Scott to be a betrayal by studio executives. The TV and International versions were not Mr. Scott's choice as well. The so- called 'Directors Cut' was done by film preservationist Michael Arick and not cut by Mr. Scott. But, the 'Final Cut' (2007) was personally assembled by Ridley Scott with revamped special effects and the original annoying electronic score by Greek composer Vengelis.)I should come clean that I was not a big fan of the original 'Blade Runner'. I felt it's loose, dreamlike, contemplative, plot-lite exploration into the world of blade runners and replicants was unsatisfying. However, with the coming of 'Blade Runner 2049', I now feel that both movies together deliver on Blade Runner's ultimate promise of intelligent sci-fi storytelling.",9,1,13,9 October 2017
Spotlight," Spotlighting Journalism
","'Spotlight' shines a light on the soul and soullessness of journalism.There is a scene in 'Spotlight' where one of the lead characters who is investigating the child sexual abuse in the Boston Catholic Church admits to having received information about the abuse years earlier and didn't do anything about it. He admits this failure to his colleagues, and there is some shock and understanding, but it is forgiven quickly. There are victims who scream at the Boston Globe: 'I sent you all of this before!' And, the reporters stare blankly back at them not knowing what to say. These scenes are emblematic of how well 'Spotlight' depicts the level of the news media's own failures as it points out the failures in others. Life is about choices, and news professionals make choices based on conscious and subconscious bias every day that readers or viewers may not see or understand. (News media bias is a hobby of mine. I am a co-author with UCLA Political Science Professor John Zaller on this subject in academic journals, including a book.)Writer/Director Tom McCarthy ('The Station Agent'; one of the writers of Pixar's 'Up') makes the right choices in 'Spotlight'. Rather than take on too much, considering the victims, the families, the priests, the archdiocese, Mr. McCarthy selectively focuses the film's point of view exclusively from that of the Boston Globe reporters. Using this narrow a focus brought criticism from many, who sought to find more villains. One of the points that the film makes is that almost no one is blameless in the Boston area, because so many stood by and did nothing.While the general knowledge of the abuse-scandal denies this film any surprises, Mr. McCarthy is still able to generate genuine interest in the characters as they uncover how the system of abuse worked and who gave the orders. An extraordinary cast is assembled. Mark Ruffalo ('Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'); Michael Keaton ('Batman'; 'Birdman'); Rachel McAdams ('Midnight in Paris'; 'The Family Stone'); and Stanley Tucci ('The Devil Wears Prada'; 'Road to Perdition') shine in particular.The film is tightly edited, yet none of the scenes felt rushed, and the cinematography is carefully inconspicuous so the story is allowed to play out on screen very clearly. Howard Shore's score is pitch perfect as usual.In the end, I found this film to be worthy Best Picture winner, and I strongly recommend it to your attention.",10,0,0,12 November 2016
Spider-Man 3," The Ambitious Spider-man 3
","Spider-Man 3 tells an ambitious number of stories in a 140 minute film. The story/character conflicts are: (1) Spider-man vs. himself: Peter has begun to succumb to Spidey stardom in New York and as any nerdy unpopular teen, he begins to become self-centered.(2) Peter Parker - Mary Jane Romance: As Spidey's fan base increases, Mary Jane's luck as an actor hits the skids. This creates tension between Mary Jane who needs Peter to be there for her, but where Peter is mostly wrapped up in his star status to understand. Mary Jane eventually turns to Harry Osborn for comfort.(3) Peter/Spider-man vs. Harry Osborn/ New Goblin: Harry, living to avenge his father's death, whom he believes was felled by Spider-man, attacks Peter just as he is about to propose to Mary Jane. Peter still believes Harry is a friend and desperately tries to rebuild a friendship.(4) Peter/Spider-man vs. Sandman: Peter and Aunt May are told that the Sandman is the real criminal that shot and murdered Uncle Ben. So Peter is also consumed by revenge, like Harry, to kill Sandman.(5) Peter/Spider-man vs. himself/Venom vs. Brock/Venom: The symbiotic black entity Venom catalyzes Peter's vengeance and aggression, leading him toward the darker nature of man. Eventually Venom takes over Brock, a discredited photographer unmasked by Peter, and Venom catalyzes Brock's vengeance to destroy Peter.From a writer's perspective, five story/character conflict dimensions are ambitious for any film, especially for a Summer blockbuster that must include $250 million dollars of special effect action sequences.However, there are so many brainless, plot-less, stupid Summer blockbusters, I cannot help but be impressed by Spider-man 3's ambition to be more. After all, this has been the triumph of the prior films -- dare to have characters and story in addition to terrific action sequences. This is also the triumph the Spider-man comic hero that has endeared him to so many. Spider-man is more than a comic book hero. He is a hero that bleeds, makes mistakes, and fights his personal demons.Sam Rami and veteran screenwriter Alvin Sargent have always been talented observers of humanity and the need to create real characters on screen. The character of Venom, actually did not appeal to Sam Rami, because of Venom's pure evil nature, until he was convinced how useful Venom worked as a catalyst to display the darkness in even the most human of characters, such as Peter Parker.It was this ambitious need to explore humanity that led to a film that tells too many stories. It is hard enough to create a film that delves into two or three levels of character conflict let alone five levels.I will give Mr. Rami and Mr. Sargent credit though. Along with the extremely talented cast, they almost pull the whole thing off -- almost, which is amazing. Not everyone can create an epic and almost pull it off. And, it is because of this, that I recommend Spider-man 3.I think the well-known critics that have chosen to tell film goers to stay away from this film do them a disservice. It is better to dare to accomplish too much, than to accomplish too little. Mr. Rami showed heroic courage even to attempt this story.In the end, I believe history will judge Spider-man 3 as a modern epic of glorious proportions. I, personally, don't agree with the tying up of all of the lose ends so neatly, but I understand why Mr. Rami did; he wanted to complete a great trilogy, comparable to Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.In summary, ignore any critic who says this film has no plot -- they are incompetent, and understand what critics mean that this film maybe over-ambitious because it is. However, see the glass as overflowing and drink it in, because Spider-man 3 will fill you with a film experience unlike most blockbusters will this year.",9,5,8,6 May 2007
Suicide Squad," Jared Leto and Margot Robbie Lift 'Suicide Squad'
","The first time I saw 'Suicide Squad' I found that the focused too much on non-super villain Deadshot, played in the film by Will Smith ('Men in Black'; 'Independence Day'), and missed the mark. However, I saw the film a second time, I found the film better than I remembered. When Jared Leto (Academy Award winner for 'Dallas Buyers Club') is on screen as the Joker with Harley Quinn, played by Margot Robbie ('The Wolf of Wall Street'), I was captivated. Their scenes are like 'Scarface' meets 'Romeo & Juliet' painted in neon carnival colors while sitting on a whirling out-of-control merry-go-round. They may be the most fascinating romantic characters portrayed on film this year, and their performances stayed with me.Writer/Director David Ayer ('Fury') may have been too tied to the source material, DC Comics 'Legends #3' graphic novel of the same name that self-consciously tried to humanize lesser known villains. Deadshot's story is mundane in an extraordinary world with a Dark Knight and a Man of Steel, and drags the whole film down. The film includes other lesser known villains, including Amanda Waller, (played by the brilliant Viola Davis of 'The Help'), Katana (played by martial arts star Karen Fukuhara), Boomerang (played by Jai Courtney), and Rick Flag (portrayed by Joel Kinsman). But we don't ever get to know them as characters and do not match the maniacal darkness and glee found in the Joker and Harley. I believe Writer/Director David Ayer, and the producers, could have benefited from a re-write before green-lighting the screenplay to make this film from good to great.The film is helped by good cinematography by Roman Vasyanov ('Fury') and composer Steven Price (Academy Award winner for 'Gravity'). The soundtrack relies heavily on good 70s rock ballads and hits that tries to keep the film's tempo up.I saw it in 3D and while a few shots were made more interesting, the 3D glasses darkened some scenes so much that I had to remove the glasses to see what was really going on. So, I recommend seeing the film in 2D.",7,1,3,12 November 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Wasted Opportunity
","With the release of 'Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker', the iconic twin suns of Tatooine have set for a final time on the once amazing family saga set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.(SPOILERS: I discuss what is NOT in the film as opposed to discussing what is in the film.)This is a film that cleverly entertains a general audience and casual Star Wars fans, while at the same time insults George Lucas, the original living Star Wars actors, and hardcore Star Wars fans. It is this duality that makes 'The Rise of Skywalker' fascinating.To a general audience and casual Star Wars fans, including most professional film critics, this film will seem like an often benign, sometimes exciting and uneven entry in the fabled franchise with several recycled features from previous Star Wars films.Only Mr. Lucas, the original Star Wars actors, and hardcore Star Wars fans will know they've been slapped in the face.I will review the film as a casual Star Wars fan first, then as a hardcore fan.From the perspective of a casual Star Wars fan, the 'The Rise of Skywalker' by Executive Producer and current CEO of Lucasfilm, Ltd., Kathleen Kennedy, and writer/director J.J. Abrams is an entertaining sequel to Mr. Abrams's first Star Wars film 'The Force Awakens'. 'The Rise of Skywalker' moves well and answers all of the lingering mysteries that Mr. Abrams introduced in his first Star Wars installment, including: (a) who are Rey's parents; (b) why is Rey so powerful with the Force; (c) what is the relationship between Kylo Ren/Ben Solo and Rey; and (d) what is the relationship between Finn and Rey.If you are curious about what happened to 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi', 'The Rise of Skywalker' almost completely denies its predecessor's existence or effect, where possible. In fact, 'The Rise of Skywalker' undos almost every choice 'Last Jedi' writer/director Rian Johnson made and relegated to inconsequence all of the new characters Mr. Johnson introduced, including Rose. (It is no secret that Mr. Johnson wrecked 'Star Wars' with lower than projected box officer returns, a Star Wars fan boycott of 'Solo: A Star Wars Story', cancellation of years of Star Wars projects, and lower than projected theme-park attendance to 'Galaxy's Edge'. It is also no secret that Bob Iger, the CEO of Disney, almost fired Ms. Kennedy for allowing Mr. Johnson to ruin Star Wars so badly.)From the general audience perspective, 'The Rise of Skywalker' looks fine cinematically and is carried confidently by composer John Williams's iconic score and musical themes. General audiences and casual Star Wars fans will clap at the end.From Mr. Lucas, the original Star Wars actors, and hardcore Star Wars fans' perspective, my guess is that 'The Rise of Skywalker' was a waste of time and an insult.Mr. Lucas was asked to rewrite parts of the films to fix the disaster that was Mr. Johnson's 'Last Jedi' and to direct all of the scenes involving Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker and every lightsaber duel to create an authentic Luke (not seen in 'The Last Jedi') and authentic Jedi swordplay. It appears 95% of Mr. Lucas's efforts were cut by Ms. Kennedy and Mr. Abrams. Mr. Hamill was asked to get in shape, cut his hair, shave, and act in scenes that told the story of how Leia became a Jedi and how Ben Solo became Kylo Ren. It appears 95% of Mr. Hamill's scenes were cut. Hayden Christensen was lured back to reprise his role as Anakin Skywalker in several important parts of the film. It appears that 100% of Mr. Christensen's scenes were cut with the exception of one voice over sequence that was buried in the middle of other voices. Leaving almost all of Mr. Lucas's, Mr. Hamill's, and Mr. Christensen's scenes on the cutting room floor is an insult to Mr. Lucas's generosity to fix the Johnson disaster, an insult to Mr. Hamill and Mr. Christensen's importance as legacy Star Wars characters and a snub to hardcore fans who knew of these scenes existence.From a hardcore fan's perspective, 'The Rise of Skywalker' is a missed opportunity.Personally, as a hardcore fan, I will pay to see this cut of 'The Rise of Skywalker' one more time and never again. Hardcore Star Wars fans will likely not go to more than one showing and try to forget Ms. Kennedy, Mr. Abrams and Mr. Johnson's Star Wars films, chalking it up to the old phase - you really never can go home again.If Mr. Lucas is ever allowed to release a creator's cut of the film, I will be there.",4,9,16,20 December 2019
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," The Highest Praise
","Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows, Part 1 is both at once the darkest and brightest star in the franchise's constellation of film adaptations. It is darkest in its detailed depiction of Harry's hero saga during his most horrible days, and brightest in story, acting and poignancy.In this faithful adaptation of the first half of J.K. Rowling's penultimate novel of the boy wizard who lived, an evil shadow has fallen across the United Kingdom as Lord Voldemort grows in power and control. Evil lurks around every corner and there is no time for birthdays, weddings and other happy occasions. This is a time for mourning the fallen, and retreating for cover until a champion rises to lead the good and brave to victory. This is also a time where young love must bloom in a freezing cold winter and deep friendships provide the only warmth and relief.It is in this bleakness where we see, more clearly than ever, the heart of Harry James Potter and the loyalty of his friends Hermione Granger and Ronald Weasley. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint have never been better in their roles, and there is an epiphany where the audience realizes that its emotional investment in these actors and films has yielded a reward greater than it could possibly have imagined.This is the true triumph of these Harry Potter films -- that they payoff in some proportion to how their original written source material paid off for readers. Rarely do films ever approach a climax equal to an extraordinary literary experience.The film production is handsome as it gives the audience the great gift of panoramic vistas of England's windswept moors, rugged forests, and overcast shores that are inserted between suspenseful action sequences in London coffee shops, muggle filled streets and inside the Ministry of Magic.Having read the books many times, I know how everything will end, but I now know, having seen the first part on film, that when Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows, Part 2 runs its last reel this summer, that I will relive all of the giddiness, glory, sadness and sorrow that I felt when I finished the last Harry Potter book.That is the highest praise I can give any film.",10,1,2,19 November 2010
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Returning to the Wizarding World of J.K. Rowling
","'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' is a film that is at first fantastically uneven, but finishes as a satisfying return to the world of magic created by J.K. Rowling. Adapted for the screen by Ms. Rowling herself, based on her own book of the same name published as a companion to her 'Harry Potter' novels in 2001, 'Fantastic Beasts' follows the New York adventures of magical creature preservationist Newt Scamander, played by Eddie Redmayne (Academy Award Best Actor for his role as Dr. Stephen Hawking in 'The Theory of Everything').Set in 1927, Director David Yates ('Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'; 'Harry Party and the Half-Blood Prince'; 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Pt. 1 & 2') and Ms. Rowling mistakenly focus the first act of the film on the technology and art department's visual re-creation of prohibition-era New York, instead of carefully crafting their characters and their motivations. It is frustrating to watch characters whom we don't know acting foolishly on screen for the first 25 minutes. I prefer screenplays where the writer develops at least one character in the first act that the audience feels for, either positively and negatively, and will follow as the drama unfolds. Ms. Rowling fails to do this for her protagonist, Newt, whom we see merely wide-eyed and maddeningly careless as his suitcase full of magical creatures gets loose. As the film progresses in the second and third acts, we finally get to know Newt and understand his motivations, but it would have been nice not to be so frustrated with him at the beginning of the film. Setting aside that major flaw, the last two thirds of the film carries through with a clearer and better paced plot.Mr. Redmayne is assisted by an excellent supporting performance by Ezra Miller ('The Perks of Being a Wallflower'; the Flash in the upcoming 'Justice League' feature film), who plays Credence Barebone, a young man forced into servitude by a religious sadistic cult leader, played by Samantha Morton. Collin Farrell is solid as mysterious Mr. Graves, who is an American auror (magical law enforcement officer). My last casting note is that there is a very special cameo by a world famous actor playing Gellert Grindelwald, the most powerful dark wizard prior to Lord Voldemort.The art and special effects department working with director of photography Philippe Rousselot ('Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'; 'Big Fish'; 'Planet of the Apes') create a beautiful, idealized vision of New York in the roaring 20s. Each frame of the film looks great. (Mr. Yates seems to have a penchant for crane shots that pull back to a long shot. This is usually used as a master shot to set the scene, and visually manipulates the audience into seeing the grandeur of the sets blended with CGI artistry as the story expands. I didn't mind being manipulated most of the time, but it felt a bit overdone after two or three.)In the end, I enjoyed this film. While not perfect, 'Fantastic Beasts' is a decent way to spend 133 minutes during Thanksgiving week or weekend.",Null,0,3,20 November 2016
Call Me by Your Name," A quiet, yet soulful and sensual summer ...
","Film Review: 'Call Me By Your Name' is possibly the name of the best film of 2017. I will likely remember this movie more than any other film I saw this year. Set in the summer of 1983 in a countryside villa in Italy, filmmaker James Ivory ('Maurice;' 'A Room with a View;' 'The Remains of the Day;' 'Howard's End') penned a screenplay, adapted from Andre Acimen's novel, that is truly breathtaking. Intermixing American English, French and Italian, Mr. Ivory carefully crafts a human story.The main characters are Elio, played by Timothee Chalamet ('Interstellar;' 'Lady Bird'), and Oliver, portrayed by Armie Hammer ('The Social Network;' 'The Man from U.N.C.L.E.') Elio's father is an eminent professor of archaeology who brings in Oliver, a doctoral student, for the summer to work on his thesis. Bathed in golden sunlight and the ravishing Italian countryside, Elio slowly develops feelings for Oliver.Director Luca Guadagnino ('I am Love;' 'Bertolucci on Bertolucci') triumphs. With only one read through with the actors and shooting most of the film in sequence, Mr. Guadagnino achieves an honesty that is rare on film. Never forced and full of doubt, insecurity, hormones, and missed opportunities, everything about Elio's first love feels like what I remember when I fell in love for the first time. It's a heady experience to be transported back to what it felt like to be in love at 17 or 18 or to remember what it felt like to have a romance that begins in the long afternoons of June and ends when the sun begins to set too early in August. Mr. Chalamet's performance is without a doubt one of the best of the year. He navigates a quiet, yet soulful and sensual summer with disarming ease. He leads the screen with a confidence equal to Armie Archer's bold American bravado. The gentle, yet fiercely emotional, relationship revealed over the course of the movie is stunning.I must also note that this is one of those films that makes you feel like you've been on vacation. The cinematography by Sayombhu Mukdeeprom and attention to detail construct a vivid experience. The charming cobblestone streets, beautiful rocky trails through pine-filled forests, leading to lazy rivers and watering holes are experiential. This film is pretty perfect. 'Call Me By Your Name' is a film where you meet real characters and visit a very distinct place in a very specific year. Winner of the American Film Institute's Best Films of 2017, nominated for 3 Golden Globes, including Best Picture - Drama, and nominated for 6 Independent Spirit Awards. I understand that at the New York Film Festival 'Call Me By Your Name' received the longest standing ovation in the festival's history. I hope the Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences likes this film as much as I did, because it deserves an Oscar Best Picture nomination.",10,9,20,28 December 2017
Meet Joe Black," A Wonderful Film
","It is rare to see a film that is as quiet as it is forceful. It's like standing before a breathtaking view alone with only the sounds of life and nature. Such a view inspires awe, reverence and silence. This comes close to the unusual feeling I get whenever I watch 'Meet Joe Black'.I had the occasion to watch it again on HBO, and I was caught up in its magic one more time.Yes, it is of ungainly length (3 hours), and it is slow by modern film standards, but it engrosses me, because it is unique. Director Martin Brest and acting heavyweights Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt make each scene so weighty and powerful that the hidden drama of Death, literally personified by Mr. Pitt's character Joe Black, presence with good man William Parrish, Anthony Hopkins, never leaves the viewers attention.Mr. Pitt acts with a gentleness and power that he has rarely demonstrated in any other character. Mr. Hopkins portrayal leaps off the screen like a force of nature equaling death, itself -- how many actors can do that?The final corporate war confrontation between the character of Drew, portrayed by gifted actor Jake Weber (from TV's 'Medium'), versus Black and Parrish is a true delight - Mr. Weber would have to be gifted to hold his own in a scene with Mr. Pitt and Mr. Hopkins (and he does so on three separate occasions in the film).Of special note is the performance by Claire Forlani, portraying the daughter of William Parrish, who falls in love with Joe Black. She has a special gentleness in her performance which makes it completely believable that if something like 'Death' physically walked the Earth, he would fall in love with her.I wish that a film like 'Meet Joe Black' could have reached its audience at 3 hours, like 'Titanic', but life and the world does not work that way.I do hope anyone who reads this review, gives this film a chance, and lets its quiet passion sweep them up.",9,12,16,4 April 2010
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Fear Leads To The Dark Side of the Force
","Film Review: 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' is a galaxy far, far away from the one George Lucas created, but the film is good, just not great. I wrote something very similar about 'The Force Awakens' when it came out. I still disagree with Disney's and J.J. Abrams' choices made in the 'The Force Awakens,' and I disagree more with how those choices play out in writer/director Rian Johnson's 'The Last Jedi.' However, I will review the film that I saw, then discuss what it isn't.Mr. Johnson has put together a decent film. It does not match the jaw-dropping visuals of 'Blade Runner 2049,' released earlier this year, or for that matter any of George Lucas's prior Star Wars films, but the concept art, art direction, and production design are serviceable, if not slightly better, than the ones J.J. Abrams approved for 'The Force Awakens.' 'The Last Jedi' does suffer from some poor editing transitions between storylines.What elevates 'The Last Jedi' is Mark Hamill's penultimate performance as Luke Skywalker and John Williams's best score in years. Mr. Hamill commits to this disheveled, disillusioned, and desiccated revised character by Mr. Johnson. And, Mr. Hamill triumphs with what he has been given. Additionally, John Williams's blend of old and new themes in a spectacular score elevate this film in a way only a John Williams score can.**Slight Spoilers Below**Don't read the next two paragraphs, if you want to know nothing about the movie.**However, Luke Skywalker's revised character is an example of a major flaw in the Disney-Abrams-Johnson changes to George Lucas's original vision. It is Star Wars Canon established by Yoda that Jedis are not fearful, because fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate, and hate leads to the dark side of the Force. For most of the film, Luke Skywalker is portrayed with so much fear of his past and the power in Kylo Ren and Rey that everything feels false about this Star Wars story. His fear of Kylo Ren's darkness during his training and Rey's darkness when Luke is asked to train her is all wrong.George Lucas's Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker would never fear the darkness within people - he would face it, like he faced Darth Vader. Even pre-Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker was never scared to take on the first Death Star, or to start Jedi training, or to go into the cave on Dagobah, and or fear to rescue his friends from Lando's cloud city on Bespin. 'The Last Jedi' Luke Skywalker is not Luke Skywalker, regardless of how well Mark Hamill performs the material he was given.**End of Slight Spoilers**Yes, Star Wars is a daunting project. It should be. Star Wars changed 20th century filmmaking in hundreds of small and large ways that reverberate today. However, Mr. Johnson was so self-conscious about the subject matter that he wrote an extremely self-conscious script that made fun of itself and Star Wars. He went for cheap 'answering machine' jokes and winks to the audience.Star Wars is Star Wars. All Disney, Mr. Abrams, and Mr. Johnson had to do was inhabit the world that George Lucas created in Episodes IV-VI and play by the rules. Constraints can trigger innovation. Lack of creativity is a poor reason to break rules.
Building an exciting three movie story about a confident and brave Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Princess Leia is not difficult. But, Disney's, Abram's, and Johnson's fear of Star Wars, led them to get angry at George Lucas's creation, ignore his ideas, and anger lead to a subconscious hate that caused them to throw away Mr. Lucas's rules, and hate lead them to the dark side of the Force.Again, this is not a bad film. But, as I wrote about 'The Force Awakens,' 'it's just not a sequel to George Lucas's 'Star Wars' films.'",5,0,0,17 December 2017
The Dark Knight," A Brilliant New American Gothic
","'The Dark Knight' is a quintessential American masterpiece. It is the new American Gothic. For those that are unfamiliar with this name, 'American Gothic' is the famous 1930s painting by Grant Wood symbolizing America at the time with a bald farmer holding a pitch fork with a stern wife in front of an American Gothic farm house. Mr. Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' is just as impressive a symbolic work, because it holds a mirror up to the darkness and hatred in people and the world, which is more complex than some real life leaders would like to pretend.In one sense, comic books have always echoed parts of American culture and gave voice to issues that plague society under the guise of fictional characters in replicas of American cities fighting evil. Mr. Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' takes the comic book guise and transforms it into a tragic and dramatic shroud. Through Mr. Nolan's lens, the characters in 'The Dark Knight' are placed into impossible ethical dilemmas by a psychopath who delights in creating anarchy, and is literally sadistic and masochistic.Method and madness have rarely been personified on film better than Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. When the Joker burns a pyramid of money (his cut of mob funds), Mr. Nolan is demonstrating that the Joker cares not for possessions or riches as a means of self-appraising his success in life. The Joker measures the success of his life by the extent that he can twist the world on its head -- how often he can make good people do bad things, or his masterpiece, taking a heroic crusader for justice, and twist him into a nightmarish murderous psychopath.Mr. Nolan's screenplay could not have been in better hands than Sir Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Christian Bale and Heath Ledger, who launch into their sculpted lines and characters with such grace and measured ferocity that there is no doubt that these men are 5 of the greatest actors of their age. Of course, one of whom, Mr. Ledger, I would have been delighted to know him better through a lifetime in film, but must suffice with the indelible memories of Ennis Del Mar and the Joker.Tragic, complex, fearless and mesmerizing are the only words I could utter after seeing Mr. Nolan's masterpiece. Mr. Nolan's film comments on the human condition as good as, or better, than any film that has ever won the 'Best Picture' Oscar from the Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences. The Dark Knight's story is timeless and elegant with breathtaking visuals, and paced perfectly in dialogue and destruction.Bravo!",10,4,9,20 July 2008
Zero Dark Thirty," Big Disappointment
","'Zero Dark Thirty' is more of a blunt object than a work of art. It is riveting because of its subject matter, and not because of the direction by Kathryn Bigelow. This is a case of where a director and screenwriter (Mark Boal) fail to illuminate its subject matter. Since this film has almost universally positive reviews (93% fresh from Rottentomatoes.com critics) and I am recommending that people wait to see this film on DVD or video streaming, I'm writing a detailed explanation. (Spoiler Alert) 'Zero Dark Thirty' uses a documentary style (known as cinéma vérité) to demonstrate how one CIA analyst, Maya (portrayed by Jessica Chastain) obtained and analyzed information learned from aggressive interrogations, including torture (some of which she ordered), of Al Qaeda accused detainees to find Osama Bin Laden's most trusted courier that eventually led to Bin Laden's whereabouts and the mission to kill Bin Laden. Without torture, 'Zero Dark Thirty' would have no hero. Very little, if any, other information was depicted in this film to identify Bin Laden's courier other than from detainees, who yielded to questions out of fear of being tortured again. In fact, the only other CIA operative, who advocated differently -- that the Cold War technique of bribery to turn double agents (without torture) -- is shown to be brutally murdered for her naiveté by a car bomb. Since Bigelow and Boal strongly advocate for Maya's story of how her obsession to find Bin Laden makes her the actual hero of the death of Bin Laden, the film is an unapologetic advocate for torture. My problem with the film is Bigelow and Boal's attempt to use the documentary style to push the audience to come to the conclusion that 'of course' torture was required to get Bin Laden. My preference for films that use a documentary style or cinéma vérité with no narrator is to NOT pretend it portrays the truth of a subject, but to pose the problem of the truth in the film (paraphrasing French philosopher Edgar Morin), allowing viewers to judge the actions of the hero -- anything else seems insecure. My last substantive critique of the film is Bigelow's depiction of the actual mission to capture Bin Laden; it's far from a model of clarity. Bigelow depicts Seal Team Six as knowing precisely what it is doing, while not translating that clarity to film or to the audience. Bigelow purposely fails to lead the audience through which building each team is in and the objective of each part of Seal Team Six. I would be extremely disappointed if this film wins any Academy Awards whatsoever.",4,10,22,20 January 2013
Burlesque," Burlesque: Fabulous Film Magic
","If you wait out the first 7 minutes of cliché small town girl heads for the big city, you will experience a glorious musical with Cher and Christina Aguilera. Set on the Sunset Strip, Burlesque is the frisky flight of fantasy of writer/director Steve Antin (whose previous claim to fame was the jock jerk in 'Goonies').There are some singer/actors that transcend their medium and undoubtedly Cher is one. Flawless at every point in the film Cher is memorizing in every scene she's in and in every song she sings.Christina Aguilera is astonishing as the ingénue turned star that demands attention through her character's pure heart and talent. I note early in this review that this is a flight of fantasy, because there are no scenes where Ali develops her talent for dancing and singing -- she starts and ends the film as talent personified. Having been a student at UCLA, I know all too well that talent and recognition are not compulsory companions. Burlesque is in the same vein of a Gary Marshall film ('Pretty Woman'), but sexier and sometimes smoking hot.Much of the sexual heat comes from Ms. Aguilera's on screen relationship with Cam Gigandet, who portrays Jack (the lead bartender at Burlesque). In a star making performance, Mr. Gigandet is more than just eye-candy for the divas; he is Ryan Phillippe in 'Cruel Intentions', sexy, cool, smart, and a man anyone would long to wake up to and few other men could compete with.The supporting cast, most notably Stanley Tucci, is superb. Mr. Tucci consistently steels the screen film-after-film. I fear that much of Alan Cummings' performance was left on the cutting room floor. However, Mr. Antin leaves in one comic stage performance from Mr. Cummings that adds some levity to the film.Mr. Antin lends a steady hand from scene-to-scene and paces the film well at 100 minutes. The music and choreography are perfect at every turn.Trust me. Drink this film in like champagne, and try not to worry if it's real wine or not, because you will feel like continuing the celebration after the last credit rolls.",9,15,28,25 November 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock Holmes Was Better Than I Expected
","The game is a foot Watson, and not so horrid a spectacle as I expected. As a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, I had deep misgivings about seeing Guy Ritchie's updated 2009 film based on the previews. I feared that he may depict a Holmes that utilizes brawn more often than intellect. However, my fears proved mostly unfounded (only 'mostly' because there is one gratuitous boxing match, featuring Holmes, placed in the screenplay to introduce the character of Irene Adler to the story). Most of the fight sequences are in genuine service to the plot, and several are performed after we hear Holmes plan each blow upon the person to be attacked. This intellectualization and economy of violence eased my fears.Another of my concerns was that the Sherlock Holmes previews had a supernatural / horror element, which to me was the antithesis of Holmes' application of the scientific method and use of deduction in criminal detection. Being a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, I am familiar with the duality that existed in Holmes' creator, where Conan Doyle was trained as a doctor, but became a believer in the supernatural later in life, after suffering a depression following a string of close family deaths. However, even in the last set of Holmes short stories, 'The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes', Conan Doyle wrote a case that proved that no vampires were involved in the crime at the heart of 'The Case of the Sussex Vampire'. So, in my mind, even in later life, Conan Doyle's belief in psychics and the supernatural did not overwhelm his faith in logic and science.Mr. Ritchie's version of 'Sherlock Holmes', in an original story written for the screen by Michael Robert Johnson, Anthony Peckham and Simon Kinberg, blends science, deduction, cults and the supernatural in a story that borrows a little from Dan Brown's conspiracy style plots. In the end, science and intellect win, and this more than anything else redeems the film from the minor detours from Conan Doyle's Holmes. For example, in one failure in accurately portraying Holmes, to create a cute moment, the 2009 version of Holmes pulls a stolen jewel from Irene Adler's necklace that eventually becomes an engagement ring for Dr. Watson. In my reading of Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, the famous sleuth would never take a stolen jewel from Irene Adler and give it to Dr. Watson. In one of the original Conan Doyle Holmes cases, 'The Case of the Blue Carbuncle', Holmes sets upon finding a rare blue jewel and when he finds it, he wires the original owner that he has it. Holmes wires the owner of the jewel despite his rare action of allowing the guilty to escape on Christmas, because it was not his job to remedy Scotland Yard's deficiencies. Conan Doyle wrote Sherlock Holmes with a heart, but with a strong moral core that does not include passing stolen jewelry.Proper recognition should go to Mr. Ritchie, and his film editor, James Herbert, for an excellent editing job on the film. The film flows from scene to scene with style and panache. I knew I was in good hands from the opening sequence, where the studio logos are blended into the brick streets of London, seamlessly leading into the opening action sequence with Holmes, Watson and Inspector Lestrade in hot pursuit to prevent a murder.In regards to the actor's performances, I was most impressed with Jude Law's portrayal of Dr. John Watson. Other professional films critics found Jude Law's portrayal to be ineffective. I, on the other hand, found Jude Law's Watson to be the cleanest and best update of all of the Sherlock Holmes characters in the 2009 film, because it was modern, but not a drastic departure from the literature. As written by Conan Doyle, Dr. Watson was never the bumbling portly Watson portrayed by Nigel Bruce in the Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes films. In the books and short stories, Dr. Watson was thin, tanned, and has a strong, stout neck.Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Sherlock Holmes was mixed. Mr. Downey did an excellent job portraying the intellectual side of Holmes, but the choice to make Holme's physical appearance slobbish was inaccurate and deeply unattractive. In Conan Doyle's 'The Hound of the Baskerville', Sherlock Holmes is described as having 'cat-like' love of personal cleanliness, so portraying Holmes with a lack of personal hygiene was a serious and unnecessary departure from the original character. Further, even if Mr. Ritchie and Mr. Downey purposefully intended to depart from Conan Doyle's classic character and make Holmes a filthy mess, I disagree with the choice on a practical film level. I found Mr. Downey an unattractive hero and unpleasant to look at. I wanted to cut his hair, give him a shave, and scrub him down with antibiotic soap. In general, a hero still looks attractive if he or she starts the film clean, becomes grimy during the course of the adventure and is clean at the end. Mr. Downey is a mess throughout the entire film.I enjoyed the portrayal of 19th Century England, and the shots a top an under-construction London Bridge. Each scene is handsomely decorated and the environment felt authentic.In total, I found 'Sherlock Holmes' (2009) to be a relatively successful attempt to rejuvenate the famous consulting detective.",8,16,30,28 December 2009
Arrival," Arrival is a nice departure
","'Arrival' is a departure from mindless sci-fi summer action films. Inspired by science fiction writer Ted Chiang's short story 'Story of Your Life,' this film is an intelligent take on how the Earth would handle first contact if 12 alien vessels appeared around the world.This is the first film I have seen from director Denis Villeneuve ('Incendies'; 'Prisoners'; 'Sicario'), and what I can say after watching 'Arrival' is that he is a solid director. He has the confidence to pace a film slowly at first, and then build intensity as the material progresses. He also has a good eye for shots and working with cinematographer Bradford Young ('Selma'; 'Pawn Sacrifice'). And, he is one of those directors that allows actors to portray intelligent characters with quiet voices, and allows the impact of their ideas to turn up the volume.Mr. Villeneuve is ably assisted by Amy Adams ('American Hustle'; 'Enchanted') who turns in a fantastic performance as Dr. Luise Banks, a linguist that is tasked with communicating with the alien visitors. It is a layered performance, where Ms. Adam's speaks with a dull affect and fierce intellect. Her emotions are not worn on her sleeve, and we see her communicate through the intensity of her eyes and her breathing.Jeremy Renner ('Hurt Locker'; 'American Hustle'; 'The Town') lends a quiet, steady supporting performance, as theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly, who is the more tender character of the two scientists who lead teams to determine the intent of the aliens. Mr. Renner and Ms. Adams work well together.The last person I want to note is writer Eric Heisserer, who adapted Mr. Chiang's short story into a feature length film. Based on his previous work, 'The Thing'; 'Final Destination 5'; 'Nightmare on Elm Street (2010),' I would not have guessed he could pen such a subtle film, which proves he is a true writer, one who can avoid the dictates of modern attention spans.After a summer of mindless entertainment, I found 'Arrival' to be strong film, and a nice reminder that you don't have to dumb down entertainment to be successful, unlike running for President of the United States.",Null,3,8,13 November 2016
The Big Short," Big Deal
","Film Review: 'The Big Short' could cause you to take the Big Sleep, but you should still see this film because it is about a Big Deal. Based on the non-fiction book of the same name, written by Michael Lewis (author of 'Moneyball'), Paramount Pictures and Brad Pitt's Plan B Entertainment create a film explaining the origins of the Great Recession. This is not easy material to understand, so the producing team smartly hires Saturday Night Live writer/director Adam McKay ('Anchorman', 'Talladega Nights', 'Ant-man') to write the screenplay. In addition to getting the right writer, they also cast Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, and Steve Carrell to join Mr. Pitt to create the smartest and most charismatic cast imaginable to present the material. This is how to make a film of substance in Hollywood. Now for the film, Mr. McKay uses almost every trick in the book to keep the audience interested. They break the fourth wall (have characters talk directly to the audience), use celebrities as cameos, like Selena Gomez, and he asks characters to play over-the-top eccentric financial players. Slowly, but surely, the fraud unfurls on screen. Since the fraud is so complicated, I'm going to take a shot at explaining the meltdown, so you have a better chance of enjoying the film as opposed to hearing the financial mess for the first time. In the early 2000s, financial institutions and markets created special securities (CDOs) made up of mortgages from people's homes between approximately 2002 and 2008. A large part of these securities were made up of subprime mortgages (mortgages issued to borrowers with poor credit ratings or were unlikely to pay the mortgages off) and then were allegedly pooled with mortgages that were not as risky. Except, they didn't diversify the CDOs very well (i.e. they paired risky mortgages with other risky mortgage based securities). These risky CDOs were then given AAA ratings by Standard & Poor's and Moody's, because the large banks/financial institutions where creating the CDOs and paying the ratings agencies to give AAA status to these risky securities (many people think this was bribery). Then, the banks pushed these risky securities to be purchased by millions of investors, who did not know they were risky because they were well rated. When, everyday people couldn't pay their mortgages, these mortgage based securities became almost worthless. 'The Big Short' is a film about three groups of fund managers and investors that discovered that the CDOs were fraudulent, and took advantage of a credit default swap market (a non-publicly traded, unregulated market) that allowed investors to bet that the housing based securities would fail. Michael Burry, played by Christian Bale, was one of the first people to understand the problem and create a way to short (bet against the risky mortgage based securities). Investors Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling), and Mark Baum (Steve Carrell) are investors also unraveling the truth behind the CDOs, and Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) is a retired banker who helps two young investors who also discover the fraud. There's much more to the film, and more financial terms and concepts to learn from the film. (This film pretty much leaves out AIG's negligent role insuring the risky securities in the credit default swap market, but is included in Mr. Lewis' book.) This is a good film. It tries to explain complicated securities that many professional investors did not understand during the housing boom, and for the most part succeeds. The best part of the film is the performances. Mr. Bale, Mr. Gosling, Mr. Carrell and Mr. Pitt are intense and excellent. There is not a chance to get to know the characters, since this is a film about characters investigating and reacting to knowledge that the U.S. and world financial markets will collapse. This film is not about the characters, but about the world they inhabit. I recommend this film to anyone who wants to know more about what happened to the financial markets, and want it to be explained by Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, Steve Carrell and Brad Pitt. Personally, I don't mind going to class with these instructors.",9,0,0,12 November 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Short of Super
","'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' came up short of super, but I still liked most of it. (This review will NOT spoil any portions of the films that are not already seen in advertisements. However, for many, this review will give crucial background to understand why Batman is different in this version.) The portrayal of Batman by Ben Affleck will be jarring for many viewers who do not know the Batman graphic novels. In this film, we meet a middle-aged Batman, more scarred, more gray, and more cynical. This film is set sometime after the graphic novel 'Batman: A Death in the Family' (where the second Robin (Jason Todd) is murdered by the Joker). Batman views Jason Todd's death as his greatest failure and keeps the second Todd's Robin's uniform on display in the Batcave. The connection with the graphic novel is expressly made in 'Batman v Superman', when the battered Robin uniform, spray painted with 'Hahaha The Jokes on You', is displayed in the Batcave as Mr. Affleck's Bruce Wayne walks past it. This graphic novel, combined with Frank Miller's 'Batman: The Dark Knight Returns' graphic novel in which Batman uses a machine gun to save a child from a kidnapper, has created a different Batman that has never been portrayed on screen before. So, if you don't want to see a grizzled, mad, gun using Batman, 'Batman v Superman' is not for you.'Batman v Superman' is very much a sequel to 'Man of Steel'. This meaner, middle-aged Batman is forced to deal with the events in 'Man of Steel' where General Zod and aliens have wreaked havoc on Earth, and he and the people of the Earth must decide if a being with Superman's powers is good or bad, God or man, and asks the question what if he turns evil. As a work of fiction, screenplay writers David S. Goyer ('The Dark Knight') and Chris Terrio (Academy Award screenplay winner for 'Argo') deal with classic conflicts: man vs God, man vs man, and man vs society.However, where Mr. Goyer so deftly dealt with larger than life debates in 'The Dark Knight', he misses the mark here. In 'The Dark Knight', Mr. Goyer was able to have the debate between regular people, like the people on the ferries who were given a life and death choice to save themselves are kill the people on two other ferries, while the Bat looked on. In 'Batman v Superman', the debates are between Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent, Lex Luthor and Holly Hunter's 'Senator Finch', and between Jeremy Iron's Afred and Bruce Wayne. The people of Gotham and Metropolis are only depicted as protesters, and Mr. Goyer and Mr. Terrio never ground the film in the lives of real people, just icons. This failure prevents the film from ever getting too deep philosophically.Regardless, Mr. Affleck's portrayal of Bruce Wayne/Batman is relentless, aggressive, and captivating. I was very much fearful of Mr. Affleck's ability to be dark, but he finds his darkness and excels. Mr. Cavil's portrayal of Superman is fine, because Superman really isn't that meaty of a character to portray. Unfortunately, Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of Lex Luthor misses the mark, mostly because of the dialogue he is given. Mr. Eisenberg is forced to speak unbelievably awkward lines and we never get a sense of real genius. Gal Gadot's portrayal of Wonder Woman is not well developed enough for me to comment.Director Zach Snyder ('300', 'Watchmen', 'Man of Steel') keeps the action moving so you don't feel the 2 hour 31 minute length, and the cinematography by Larry Fong ('Super 8', 'Watchmen', 'Now You See Me') is beautiful. The Art Direction and Production Design teams have done a fantastic job creating gritty and timeless cities for this clash of titans.The bottom line is that there are about three or four really bad scenes, and the about five or six really good scenes, so on balance, I recommend this film for anyone who is alright seeing a different kind of Batman, and doesn't mind a film that misses the mark 30%-40% of the time.",7,0,3,12 November 2016
