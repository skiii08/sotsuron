The Ring," Very good film with one caveat
","Loved it. Excellent Script and direction. Incredibly creepy with several memorable scenes. But if anything, I thought this movie explained too much. It's an interesting balance of explaining too much of the WHY but leaving the HOW hanging. Luckily there remains some existential mystery, especially with the ending.",9,1,1,22 May 2020
The Witch," Pushing horror genre forward
","A+ for originality and creativity. I loved the premise of the movie and general arc of the script. The score was top notch. But I found some of the other technical aspects to be lacking. Visually it was 'ok' with a handful of striking scenes. Overall, it's an original film with an ambitious vision for the horror genre and a fantastically climatic and creepy ending!",8,0,1,16 May 2020
