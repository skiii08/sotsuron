Sucker Punch," 'Sucker Punch' Is 'Inception' Without Representation
","'Sucker Punch' comes as a disappointment to me because the previews for the film looked really good. I love action movies, and a film where the heroine warriors are adolescent angst- ridden girls has to be unique. Unfortunately, 'Sucker Punch' feels more like a video game or a music video: there are great special effects and action sequences, but they accompany a half-baked story line, underdeveloped characters, and a series of highly-stylized fantasy episodes that come out of nowhere and tie together poorly.It's as if Zach Snyder made this film as an excuse to show such action sequences, because those sections of the film where girls are kicking ass are very well polished and are great eye candy. What we the audience really need to know is 'Why?'.The movie starts off with a pretty blonde girl whose real name we never find out (Emily Browning). Through a montage, we learn that the girl's mother has died, leaving her with her sister and an abusive stepfather. When that stepfather attempts to abuse the younger sister, the blonde girl pulls a gun out on him, but accidentally shoots her sister instead.In a plot devise seemingly ripped right out of 'Chicago' (2002), the girl is sent to a mental institution with other girls her age, where she becomes psychoanalyzed by Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), the seemingly only well-meaning person to work in the facility. Dr. Gorski tells her students/patients to set their mind free by using their imaginations, and these girls seem to have more vivid imaginations than the good doctor gives them credit for.In a confusing segway, the blonde girl goes from being in a mental institution to being a stripper in a seedy club. Her name becomes Baby Doll, her fellow patients are also erotic dancers, Dr. Gorski is a dance instructor, and the other institution workers are owners of the club, or pimps. Again, does this remind you of 'Chicago'?Although this strip club is much nicer than the grim loony bin, Baby Doll still seeks escape. Once again, she imagines herself and four other acquaintances yielding swords and guns, and attacking faceless soldiers who stand in the way of obtaining five objects that will help her and the others escape. According to their imagined Obi-Wan-like mentor simply known as Wise-Man (Scott Glenn), the five objects they need are a map, a thing that makes fire, a knife, a key, and the last thing Baby Doll has to figure out for herself.The plot synopsis is a headache to write about, and you can imagine what it's like to watch it. The truth is, the imagination synopses would have worked so much better if Dr. Gorski had actually TAUGHT these girls how to imagine, rather than just saying things like 'Open your heart and let your imagination take you.' That quote is not verbatim, by the way, but it's pretty close.Plus, these girl characters are so underdeveloped that you don't get a sense of how they came up with these fantasies of kicking ass and taking names. It's not unusual for boys to fantasize this way. And yes, you're given a brief back story for Baby Doll, but it isn't enough because she literally doesn't talk for the first 20 minutes of the film. You don't know why she wants to escape, or what she's going to do once she does. Plus, once she kills her sister, which is something devastating and life changing in and of itself, it's never mentioned again in this movie.Her fellow BFFs with ironic nicknames are not developed at all. Amber (Jamie Chung) and Blondie (Vanessa Hudgins) are no more than just pretty faces. Sisters Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish) and Rocket (Jena Malone) have a back story, but it's not much of one. You learn that they ran away from home, but never why, how they ended up in an institution, or their ambitions besides leaving the place they're in right now.Plus, Wiseman just pops up in their dreams, and seems to have no basis whatsoever. Why didn't Dr. Gorski guide these girls in these imaginings? Doing so would have given her far more clout as a mentor.So 'Sucker Punch' is a big miss. Although the action sequences are well made and enticing at times, it's almost as if Zach Snyder made these short films, and someone else tried to tie them together with a really undercooked story line. The ending is just confusing, and feels incredibly weak. A 'Chicago'-like song and dance number during the end credits feels just as random and out of place.In addition to 'Chicago', I was also reminded of 'Inception' (2010) while watching this movie. While 'Inception' had its confusing moments, it had a coherent story line, and at least you knew why people in that movie had the dreams they were having. It was also a lot deeper a story. 'Sucker Punch' is just a music video in disguise as a feature film. The more people who make these kinds of movies, the longer MTV is going to go without showing music videos. Why bother, right?",5,5,10,9 April 2011
Kung Fu Panda," Not Just a Great Animated Movie- A Great Movie . . . Period!
","I was very entertained by 'Kung-Fu Panda'. This movie ranks among Dreamworks Animation's best along with 'Shrek', 'Shrek II', and 'Antz'. The animation as a whole was excellent, including the fantasy sequences that took the form of supposed 2D animation. Even when the animation was 3D, the animation had everything down to a T from the blades of grass to roof shingles to animal's fur.Of course, since 3D has now become the norm for animated movies, I know that 3D animation alone cannot save a movie. For instance, 'Doogal', 'Shrek The Third', and 'Shark Tale' (which also featured the voices of Jack Black and Angelina Jolie) were big disappointments for me. Fortunately, there was enough good comedy, great action sequences, and intriguing characters to keep me entertained and to rate this movie as the best to come out of this summer so far.For starters, Jack Black was perfect as Po the Panda. In my opinion, Black was underused in 'Shark Tale', which was probably why I didn't like that movie so much. Here, he brings his great comic timing and a touch of his Tenacious D personality into this panda character. He especially works very well in the training sequences with Head Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). I thought it odd that his character was the only panda in a story set in China, but I won't get too picky.The actors who played the Furious Five were also well cast. Angelina Jolie was a natural to play Tigress, who is probably the first truly strong female character in animation history who also isn't involved in a love story subplot of a film. I actually found myself relieved that they left such a subplot out and just concentrated on a great story.If I have one complaint against the movie, it's that the other four fighters weren't as focused on as they should have been. Yes, there's only so much you can fit into a 90 minute movie, but the snake (Lucy Liu), crane (David Cross), praying mantis (Seth Rogen), and monkey (Jackie Chan) all individually made such intriguing characters. Indeed, this is one of the few animated movies I've seen that merits a sequel, and I hope that all four of them are focused on in that other movie should it come along.Otherwise, that's my only complaint against the movie. It just worked so well otherwise. Other than the mostly American voice-overs, the movie stayed true to a traditional Kung Fu movie by the likes of Bruce Lee and Sonny Chiba, and also had elements of spaghetti westerns and other movies such as 'Star Wars'. None of that would have been complete with a great Darth Vader-esquire villain like leopard Tai Ling (played by lesser known actor Ian McShane), and an even better Yoda-esquire mentor like tortoise Ancient Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim). This is an altogether incredible movie that I personally can't wait to purchase on DVD. I may even see it again in theaters, and there are few movies that make me want to do that.",9,3,4,11 June 2008
"I Love You, Man"," Smart & Enjoyable Film; Jason Segel's and Paul Rudd's Best
","Even though Judd Apatow had nothing to do with this film (as far as I know), it will inevitably be compared to both 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' and 'The 40 Year Old Virgin'. It's not very hard to see why, since both male leads are frequently in lead or supporting roles in Apatow-directed or -produced films. Since those two films most especially exceeded many people's expectations, Jason Segel and Paul Rudd both probably had a lot of pressure for this film to be funny. Fortunately, this film succeeded in being as funny and as refreshingly honest as the aforementioned comedies.'I Love You, Man' is a comedy that doesn't quite fit into the 'romantic comedy' or 'feel good comedy' categories. It has elements of both, and fortunately, all the right elements.The premise of the movie is a bit unconventional. Paul Rudd plays Peter Klaven, a moderately successful and ambitious real estate broker who just proposed to his beautiful and articulate girlfriend, played brilliantly by Rashida Jones. He seems to have everything going for him, until he realizes he doesn't have a best guy friend. All his life, he has had woman friends, which isn't a bad thing. However, he feels a void, especially since he doesn't have a best man to choose. He enlists the help of his mother (SNL alum Jane Curtin) and brother (current SNL player Andy Samberg) to find a guy friend, creating a hilarious montage of unsuccessful 'man dates'. After those attempts don't go well, he spontaneously meets a broker named Sydney Fife (Jason Segel). Through Peter's awkwardness with having a best male friend, they hit it off. However, Peter's cluelessness with what information to share with a male friend as opposed to a female friend creates tension between new friend Sydney, his fianc√©, and her friends.The premise is one of the best things about this film. It's safe to say that everyone has had moments where everything is going right except for one minor thing, except it doesn't seem too minor to you the more you think about it. One of the most poignant scenes is when Rudd is driving around L.A., and he sees various types of male bonding. The left-out look on Rudd's face was both heartfelt and understandable. Of course, when he asks his family for help, it's not made clear why he didn't ask his brother to be his best man. The brothers appear to get along well, although once Rudd's character goes on a quest to find a guy friend, Samberg's character appears to get pushed into the background until the very end. Samberg was very funny in this movie, but his character created this tiny plot hole in the film.That being said, Jason Segel's character was absolutely brilliant, and the opposite of whom he played in both 'Freaks and Geeks' and 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall'. He's confident in this movie, and his humor comes from street smarts more than awkwardness and self-doubt. That's not to say his previous performances weren't good. Rather, Segel shows in this movie that he's good at playing a different kind of ambitious person. His lines are often times laugh-out-loud funny, and he plays very well off of Paul Rudd's slightly unsure-of-himself character.Of course, in similar buddy movies, there's always the subplot when a person is either married or in a committed relationship, that the main guy meets an outgoing other guy, they become friends, and they spend so much time together that the wife/steady-girlfriend immediately becomes jealous. This subplot is especially prevalent in movies where Jennifer Aniston is that girl. Here, Rashida Jones plays a far more realistic counterpart to Paul Rudd. She's not immediately jealous of Segel, but there is some friction later in the movie. The most refreshing part is that Jones' character is far more reasonable than other similar characters. Her reactions are familiar, yet she still maintains a calm dignity throughout the movie that's rare, especially in romantic comedies. Jones, a regular on 'The Office', shows brilliance in this role. As long as she stays the hell away from chick flicks along the lines of 'She's Just Not That Into You', she'll be a welcome face in film, and not just in Judd Apatow-influenced movies.I highly recommend this picture. It's funny in some of the same ways the aforementioned Judd Apatow films are, but there's another level of refreshing honesty, brilliant writing, laugh out loud humor, and a slightly-unusual plot line that sets it apart from those films. It hasn't been released to theaters yet, but when it does, I hope it's a hit. If the writing team here was worried movie goers would think the film to be 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall 2', hopefully they won't have anything to worry about.",9,48,86,11 March 2009
Once," One of my Favorite Films Released in 2007
","You can say a lot about 2007 not being a great year. On the political side, the economy crumbled a bit, oil prices skyrocketed, New Orleans is still in a wreck, and the Democrats in office were unable to make progress because of President Bush's stubborn ways. With all this chaos in today's world, one turns to entertainment. However, scripted TV shows halted due to the writer's strike, and the music industry in spite of sagging CD sales had not been churning out particularly good new music. Fortunately, after a creative slump, movies are the one medium that are bouncing back. 'Once' is no exception.I went to see this film on a whim earlier last year when it was playing at an nearby independent theater. It had gotten a pretty good review from Peter Travers of Rolling Stone Magazine, so I admittedly went in with expectation that the movie would be good.Fortunately, it was good, but in a different way than I could have imagined. I didn't expect a musical of sorts, and I got an unconventional one filled with original and awe-inspiring songs. It sounds very hackneyed when I write this, but the music was truly moving, especially the song 'Falling Slowly' which has fortunately been recently nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song.The storyline was also intriguing, and the dialogue was pretty good considering most of it was improvised. The ending, which I won't give away, was just the right touch for this film, and the replay of the song 'Falling Slowly' could not have fit better into the end sequence.It's a fault of the MPAA that this film was rated R. It really shouldn't have been. There was absolutely no violence, no nudity, and most importantly, a heart-warming story that people of all ages should be exposed to. If anything, the film should have been rated PG-13. It's just another example of the MPAA's flawed and inefficient rating system. Don't let the few F-word's in this movie fool you. If you have kids, and they want to see this movie, let them! Period.",10,3,6,28 January 2008
The Expendables," 'Expendables' Reminds Us Why We Will Watch Sylvester Stallone
","'The Expendables' is without question the most anticipated movie of the summer of 2010. Its cast is a who's who of established action film stars of the previous three decades. Even though the previews gave away the cameo by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, it still gave us just another reason to stand in line for this movie.And who else leads the impressive roster of stars but the American dream himself, Sylvester Stallone, who also co-wrote and directed this movie himself. Stallone is one of those rare movie stars who, even in that period of time (circa 1998-2005) when he wasn't making many films, you never heard him referred to as a B-lister or a has-been. It could be because he has arguably had more career comebacks than any actor in history.Don't call 'The Expendables' a comeback, though. If anything, it's a further reminder that Stallone can still make engrossing films that defy target audience groups. Oh yeah, and he looks better than any 64-year-old I know of.Although Stallone wears three heavy hats in this movie, he doesn't carry the weight of the movie on his own shoulders. You've already read the names of the action stars who support him here. Although the youngest of the Expendables (Jason Statham) is 37, they are far from a rag-tag crew. This movie shows that they can still kick more ass than 'Kick- Ass' (2010).The Expendables describes a team of what could be considered mercenaries, or bounty hunters. They go on high-risk missions, guns in hand, and pick up the money owed to them at the end of the day. Their main mission in this movie is initially to overthrow a South American dictator in the fictional nation of Vilena. Eventually, they find that the real enemy is ex-CIA agent James Munroe (Eric Roberts) aided by 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin and a whole army of guerrilla soldiers.This movie is full of action sequences, all of which are fun to watch. There are also some scenes involving knives (particularly ones thrown by Jason Statham) that even made me flinch. Although there are plenty of scenes involving knives and big guns, there are some great sequences involving hand-to-hand combat. You definitely don't want to take a bathroom break when 5'6 Jet Li takes on 6'4 Dolph Lundgren. There's also a fight scene between Steve Austin and Randy Couture that will satisfy both UFC and WWE fans.These scenes were not without their confusion, though, especially those shot using what appeared to be a hand-held camera. There were a lot of close-up shots during these intense parts that didn't seem necessary, and the way the camera shook and almost too quickly cut to another scene was confusing. Ang Lee used similar camera tricks in his version of 'Hulk', and they bewildered more than entranced. A thinking man's movie it is not, that's for sure, but it is still a fun movie that needs to be seen on the big screen. Plus, with all the testosterone in it, it may have been difficult for a woman to stand out. Although she didn't have any weapons or fighting power, Giselle Itie was hardly a damsel in distress. In fact, one scene I won't give away has her making a decision that few, men or woman, would have made amidst all the explosions and gunfire. You'll know it when you see it.'The Expendables' will not disappoint action fans. It also is not short of quotable lines, especially in Gov. Schwarzenegger's cameo. Expendable, by definition, means considered to be not worth keeping or maintaining, but the careers of everyone involved in this film remain quite the opposite.",8,176,313,9 August 2010
Horrible Bosses," Everyone's Had A Bad Boss, & Everyone's Had That Fantasy
","For us moviegoers who have had at least some real world experience, and have had 'one of those jobs' with 'one of those bosses', 'Horrible Bosses' comes as a huge breath of fresh air. Regardless of whether it's a good job or not, there are some, perhaps many, executives who leave a trail of blood on their way to the top, and don't even have the courtesy to clean it up. It doesn't matter who you are or what you do. These bosses are just assholes or bullies.As I watched this movie, I couldn't help but think of a horrible boss that I had. I was working in a grocery store in college, and one of my assistant managers made Ebenezer Scrooge look like Lee Iaccoca. I worked hard every day I was there, but if I did one thing wrong, he would get right in my face and speak harsh words through gritted teeth. I always wished he would get himself caught in the box crusher out back, while I 'accidentally' pulled the switch. If that actually happened, I would be writing this review from jail. Still, though, for disgruntled workers like me, 'Horrible Bosses' struck very familiar tones.Jason Bateman ('Hancock' (2008), 'Up In The Air' (2009)), Jason Sudeikis (TV's 'Saturday Night Live'), and Charlie Day (TV's 'It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia') do great jobs portraying hard-working professionals whose bosses stand in the way of advancements in their jobs and lives. Of course, their performances would not have been great without the actors playing those bosses.It's no surprise seeing Kevin Spacey as a corrupt, micromanaging hothead at the financial firm where Nick Hendricks (Bateman) works. He played the same kind of character in 'Swimming With Sharks' (1994), and he does well playing someone who is mean and intense. He also doesn't miss a beat when he awards a coveted position to himself. Other actors may have winked and nodded to the camera at that point, but Spacey never has to.The other horrible bosses are brilliantly over the top. Bobby Pellitt (Colin Farrell) is a coked-up slacker of an employee at Pellitt Chemicals who is hired only because of his father, founder Jack Pellitt (Donald Sutherland). Although Kurt Buckman (Sudeikis) is second in command, Bobby becomes CEO, and Kurt's boss, after Jack suddenly dies. While Jack was like a father to Kurt, Bobby is the worst boss ever.Anyone who has seen a preview for the film knows that Kevin Spacey and Colin Farrell could easily be bad bosses, but Jennifer Aniston? A bad boss to a guy? Well, dental assistant Dale Arbus (Day), who is engaged, is a lot more professional than his boss, Dr. Julia Harris, who is a nymphomaniac that takes pride in sexually harassing Dale every chance she gets. To guys, this boss may be a dream come true, as Kurt, who has a way with the ladies, surmises many times in the movie.It's refreshing to see Aniston in a comedy role that doesn't require her to be the distraught girlfriend or the whiny single woman, which are roles that have practically defined her acting career after 'Friends'. Here, she's funny because she says the most outrageous things to Dale, and her come-ons to him effectively bring the awkward and uncomfortable. And yes, this is coming from a heterosexual man who had a crush on Rachel in the 90's.So why do these three friends not quit their jobs? Well, it's 2011, and the economy still sucks. That point makes sense to me and anyone else who has turned on the news lately. So they decide to hire a hit-man, although have no clue as to how they do that. Their attempts to find one on Craig's List and through an OnStar-like representative are pretty funny.Eventually, they go to the bad part of the city and happen upon former convict Dean Jones (Jamie Foxx in his first funny role in years), who goes by a nickname that I can't print on IMDb. Rather than Mr. Jones whacking these bosses, he suggests each of them whack one of the bosses that's not his own. Oh yeah, they have to make it look like accidents too.From there, the three friends break into their bad bosses' houses in desperate measures to off their bosses. It's funny how they go about doing these things without even the slightest idea how to create a perfect murder. If I described each part and why it was funny, it would completely take away the magic of this film. Plus, there are some great plot twists that effortlessly weave their way into this story, and even result in some shocking turning points here and there.Other comedies of similar nature would have the main characters be too nice, and ultimately decide in the end that killing is not the answer. Here, the story comes close to that conclusion, but fortunately doesn't succumb to that temptation. What results is a hilarious comedy that doubles as a revenge fantasy, and most of the plot elements fit together perfectly. There is also a surprising cameo at the end, who fortunately is also funny.Of course, many people are already comparing this movie to 'The Hangover' (2009) and, for that matter, 'The Hangover II' (2011). To those people I simply say: stop! Not every comedy that has three or more guys working together is automatically a ripoff of 'The Hangover', nor is this movie trying to be 'The Hangover'. The guys in 'The Hangover' didn't have a plan, whereas the guys in 'Horrible Bosses' do. Their plans inevitably go awry, but that's why it's funny. Take a deep breath, remind yourself that's it's mostly original, and enjoy the film.",8,0,0,17 July 2011
The Polar Express," 'The Polar Express' Is A Surprisingly Good Trip
","I try not to have expectations when I go to see films. Often, my problem is usually that I'm excited about a film's opening, and my expectations are usually high. In the case of 'The Polar Express', my expectations were actually pretty low.Growing up, I would read and reread 'The Polar Express', a book written and illustrated by Chris Van Allsburg, every Christmas. It still ranks as one of my favorite children's books. The story was great, the illustrations were amazing, and the book never lost its charm to me as I got older.Naturally, when I heard they were making a movie out of it, and an animated one at that, I could not help but dismiss it as a ploy for Hollywood to take a sweet, timeless children's fable, and exploit it for a cheap buck. Now that I've actually seen the movie, I can say that it was far better than I thought it would be.Director Robert Zemekis, who also co-produced and co-wrote the screenplay, managed not only to make the film look amazing, but still kept the heart and the main moral of the original book within the movie. There are a lot of parts here that were not in the book, like the train slipping on an icy lake, and the caboose disattaching from the train with some of the kids on it. However, the really important parts of the book were maintained here. The main boy in the story still wants a bell, Santa gives it to him, and . . . you can figure out the rest.I didn't expect to like many of the additional characters they added to the movie, but I thought they were all characterized very well. I liked how the conductor (Tom Hanks) actually had a personality, unlike in the book where the focus was solely on the boy. I also liked how the boy interacted with other kids on the train, especially an African-American girl (Nona Gaye) whom he befriends. There's also a really sweet song called 'Spirit of the Season' that she sings along with a boy credited as 'Lonely Boy'. The way the song is sung, and the CGI-imaging of the night sky, are both truly spectacular.Some of the films excursions that I thought were going to be cheap plot devices actually served the film well. After all, a book that's roughly 30 pages long probably won't amount to a 2-hour movie. Still, these subplots were used in a way to not only cleverly characterize the main characters, but also to give a better dimension to the North Pole. You would never see the elves, how they transport themselves, and what the villages in Santa's North Pole look like if the film stuck straight to the book. Zemekis has consistently been very good at using computer animation to add not only to characters, but make their worlds far more elaborate and interesting.With all that said, I had some major reservations about the film. While the animation was really good in terms of set design, I hated how it made the humans look. They almost looked like zombies at times, and it was a little scary.Don't get me wrong. Motion capture animation is pretty amazing, and probably not as time consuming as regular animation. However, when the main characters are humans, and the conductor looks exactly like Tom Hanks, why not just film them? That would probably cut the $165 million budget down significantly, or at least I would imagine.Also, it really irked me that most of the children did not have names. The main character is labeled 'Hero Boy' in the closing credits, the black girl is named 'Hero Girl', a nerdy boy is credited as 'Know-It-All', and so on. Why not give them names? What's the harm in naming Hero Boy something like Tommy or Jimmy? It's not hard.I also hated how the main characters are kids, yet the actors who do the voices for them are not kids. 'Hero Boy' is actually voiced by Tom Hanks, although he actually sounds like a real kid. Same with Nona Gaye, Peter Scolari, and Eddie Deezen. While their child voices sound authentic, it seems like a lot of unnecessary work to digitally doctor their voices to make them sound like kids. Why not just (Gee, I don't know!) hire child actors to do the voices!?!?! It worked for 'A Charlie Brown Christmas' (1965), and it can't be difficult.Tom Hanks doing the voices of six different characters felt more gimmicky to me than cutting edge. Hanks is far from the first actor to play multiple roles in a single movie, but Peter Sellers, Lee Marvin, or Eddie Murphy he is not. In the movies those actors were in as multiple characters, they disappeared into their characters so much that their multiple roles showed their acting ranges. Here, every character Hanks voices (except the boy) sounds like Hanks. You can tell that Hanks is the voice of the conductor, the hobo, the boy's father, and Santa Claus. The gimmick is so distracting that it takes you out of the movie for a few moments.While 'The Polar Express' has its hang ups, it can and should be considered the first Christmas classic of the CGI-age. It still gets re-released into theaters every Christmas, as it has a renewed following thanks to great 3D effects that are becoming increasingly popular amongst moviegoers. It also is one of the only adaptations of a children's book that adds to its source while also maintaining its heart. My guess is that many generations will return to it year after year, and it will keep ringing just like the bell in the story.",7,12,16,13 December 2011
Tropic Thunder," Not A Home Run Movie, But Probably A Base Hit
","I am probably going to get a lot of scrutiny for this review, but I really don't care. The truth is that I saw it, I liked it, but I didn't love it the way I thought I would. Let's face it: this summer has had some surprises, and a few movies that have lived up to their hype. 'Iron Man' was one of those pleasant surprises, and 'The Dark Knight' fit into the latter category.However, 'Iron Man' and 'The Dark Knight' are not comedies, and therefore are not as subjective. In other words, there are rarely any mixed reviews for these movies. Comedies are more hit or miss, and this comedy was a mixed bag for me.I was expecting an over the top farce on Hollywood, and that's exactly what I got. There's a potential problem in that when comedic actors try to spoof the so-called corrupt movie industry, 95% of the audience don't normally get the jokes because they haven't worked in Hollywood. However, one of the movie's strengths is that Ben Stiller, who also wrote and directed this film, made some smart choices in terms of on screen gags and certain cameos to bring a majority of the audience in with the joke. For instance, the mock previews at the beginning of the film were brilliantly over the top. And it was funny to see Tom Cruise as an overweight, short-tempered studio executive.Also, the movie's #1 strength can be summarized in three words: ROBERT DOWNEY, JR. He was just fantastic in this film. Of course, he's going to face a lot of scrutiny for his role since he spends a majority of it in black-face, but he really nailed the method actor spoof incredibly well. As long as people see that he's making fun of actors who take themselves too seriously, not people of color, they'll enjoy every minute he's on the screen. I would even go as far as to say that Downey could even be a potential nominee for Best Supporting Actor at next year's Oscars. You may think I'm crazy, but remember that Madelyn Kahn was nominated for her role in 'Blazing Saddles' back in 1975. Downey's scenes with rapper/actor Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson, a great straight man in this film) were pretty good, too.Unfortunately, there were some major inconsistencies with the plot and the character development which, had they been explained better, would have resulted in a funnier film. For instance, Ben Stiller plays an Arnold Schwarzeneggar/Sylvester Stallone like action hero who wants to be taken more seriously as an actual actor, which is understandable. However, it is never explained why he kept making those action movies which make him look like a one trick pony. Stiller's character came off more as a cheap ripoff of White Goodman (from 'Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story' (2004)) and Derek Zoolander (from 'Zoolander' (2001)) combined. There could have been a lot more originality and depth in his character, but the scenes of him as 'Simple Jack' were funny enough to expose his character's vanity.Furthermore, why would a movie studio hire a first time director (Steve Coogan) to shoot a big budget movie about Vietnam? This is a spoof movie on Hollywood with a lot of name dropping, and no one thought to explain why Oliver Stone wasn't hired, or Francis Ford Coppola. That was a missed opportunity to get a good laugh, and to remove a plot inconsistency.I love Jack Black, but man, was he a disappointment in this movie! Speaking of plot inconsistencies, it was never explained nor mentioned why Black, as an A-list comedic actor by the likes of Mike Myers or Eddie Murphy, was cast in a serious movie about the Vietnam War. His character appeared to express no motivation to have a serious role, and his drug-addiction antics were also flat and not even worthy of a light chuckle. His character was direction-less, and he really could have been written a lot better for Jack Black's sake. After all, Black is extremely talented and incredibly funny. To see his talent go to waste in this movie is too bad.I'm sure my disappointment in this movie comes from waiting four months in anticipation for its release. But I reiterate when I say that I'm not entirely disappointed with this movie. There were some moments of big laughs, and those moments came when it didn't seem as though the cast (or the script) tried too hard for a laugh. There were just some missed opportunities for laughs, especially in relation to war movies. For instance, they were shooting a Vietnam movie, yet it seemed as thought the only movie they could spoof was 'Platoon' (1986) with Ben Stiller copying Willem Dafoe's famous arms in the air pose. There were also some key opportunities to spoof 'Full Metal Jacket' (1987) or 'Born on the Fourth of July' (1989). After all, with Tom Cruise in the cast, how could they not reference that movie? So I'm marginally recommending this film. It was good, but not great, and it's worthy of being rented. Robert Downey, Jr. was this movie's saving grace, and he's really the comeback kid of 2008.",7,5,11,14 August 2008
Bridesmaids," Finally! A Female-Centric Wedding Comedy Done Right After So Long!
","'Bridesmaids' is a huge breath of fresh air after the atrocious, forgettable messes of romantic comedies that were 'Bride Wars' (2009) and 'You Again' (2010) to name a few. After sitting through those movies, which despite their bad reviews were actually modest box office hits, I truly assumed the wedding movie was dead. Wedding movies of late were either overly- sentimental fluff that could be used as wedding planners' promotional videos, or uninspired slapstick comedy where attractive women pull mean pranks on one another.'Bridesmaids' is already being toted as an alternative wedding movie because it's co- produced by Judd Apatow, and has gross-out humor that decidedly appeals to guys. There is toilet humor in only one section of the movie, and it is funny, but it's not solely what makes the film great.Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph are two of the funniest and most talented women to ever come out of 'Saturday Night Live'. I always thought they deserved the successful post-SNL careers that Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are currently experiencing, and this movie may ensure they get it.Wiig, as the star and the co-writer of this film, turns in a great, poignant performance here as Annie, a woman who is down on her luck in love and her career. She once owned a bake shop that closed due to the recession, and she's in a hapless, artificial relationship with a cad played by Jon Hamm.Her best friend Lillian (Rudolph), on the other hand, is getting married and wants Annie to be her maid of honor. The trouble is, Annie is not quite as experienced in planning wedding festivities as another bridesmaid, Helen (Rose Byrne), who is a more recent friend of Lillian. Helen is quite a bit wealthier than Annie, and much more ostentatious and bombastic about her position in life, although more subtly.It's really funny how Wiig plays up how enraged Annie is over Helen, and Helen is indeed a character who is easy to dislike. Many other Hollywood writers would have staged a big fight between the two bridesmaids involving throwing food and scratching. The problem with a scene like that is it's childish. You really wouldn't see women in their 30's acting such a way, unless perhaps they're on 'Bridezilla'.More to the point though, the movie works because it really centers on how preparation for a happy event like a wedding can be really stressful on different involved parties for different reasons. Such planning also rekindles hard feelings in some people over where they are in life, and why they are not where they want to be. For that reason, you really empathize with Wiig in her performance. Fortunately, it also helps that her comic timing is spot on.There are also great supporting performances all around. Melissa McCarthy (TV's 'Mike and Molly') steals a lot of scenes with some gut-bustingly hilarious lines, not to mention a gross- out moment involving a bathroom sink. Chris O'Dowd also turns in a memorable performance as Officer Nathan Rhodes, and has many genuinely sweet moments alongside Wiig. The late Jill Clayburgh was the perfect casting choice for Annie's Mom, and has some great lines that keep the movie down to earth. It's hard to think of a better final performance on her part.'Bridesmaids' did occasionally fall victim to a few wedding movie clich√©s, such as one of the bridal party members getting cold feet the day of the wedding, and a big name musical act actually performing at the end of the film. However, there is so much this movie did correctly that many wedding comedies have done wrong, especially 'Brides Wars'.I should note, however, that 'Bride Wars' was also co-written by a female former SNL-cast member, Casey Wilson, so it's not entirely fair to rip on that movie. Plus, Wilson is a very talented performer who happened to be fired from SNL before she really got to shine. Considering how well Wiig has done on and outside of SNL, it probably wouldn't hurt for her to give Wilson some writing tips.",9,3,8,6 June 2011
Before Sunset," A Sequel That Compliments The Original
","I liked this film's predecessor, 'Before Sunrise' (1995), a lot because of its intriguing characters, the chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy that never let up, and the dialogue that never felt written even though it was. The original movie could have easily done without the sequel, just as many films not based on comic book characters could. With that idea in mind, this film could have also brought the story of Jesse and Celine to a happy ending that felt like a cop out, which I expected it to do. However, director and writer Richard Linklater manages to bring these characters into full circle in 'Before Sunset' without giving the romantic comedy fans what they want, which is why 'Before Sunset' is just as good as its predecessor.Taking place nine years from where the original film left off, Jesse (Hawk) is no longer a slacker, but an established author who wrote a bestselling account of his one night with a French woman he barely knew. Since he did not exchange contact information with Celine (Delpy) when departing Vienna, writing this book was more or less the best way of contacting her, which he does successfully as he visits Paris and attends a book signing. She meets him there, and they discuss their lives since their previous encounter, as well as where their lives are headed. Perhaps the most pressing question, at least by eager audience members, is if they are actually going to stay together this time.Amazingly enough, its very easy to find this movie on DVD, and far more difficult to find 'Before Sunrise'. The latter film was released once on DVD in 1999 and, as of the date of this review, is out of print. It's surprising too, because I go to video stores and see the 'Two DVDs for One' set of movies all the time. Sometimes the movies go together for obvious reasons, such as 'Cocoon' (1985) and 'Cocoon: The Return' (1988). Other times, I've seen 'Kids' (1995) and 'The Rules of Attraction' (2001) together in the same set for no apparent reason. 'Before Sunrise' and 'Before Sunset' deserve to be watched in the order they were made, because I doubt moviegoers who had seen the former would not care about the characters in the latter. However, considering this film received an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay, and its predecessor received no nominations (other than an MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Kiss), I could be wrong.Again, though, this film is on par with the original in the excellent dialogue and the undeniable chemistry between Hawke and Delpy. In this movie, there are longer shots of them walking and talking together. In the first movie, the cameras cut back and forth to show each one of them talking to the other. Here, they're in the same frame, so it's even more amazing that they engage in their conversations and never even come close to missing a beat.Being a fan of the original film, part of me longed for Vienna over Paris. I know that's hard to believe, but the shots of the film in the original were so good, and the places Jesse and Celine visited were not touristy. In this film, they go around Paris, but they don't stop by the Eiffel Tower or the Louvre a.k.a the real touristy spots. They venture through the cobblestone streets and coffee shops, and eventually through gardens and aboard a ferry. All this great scenery, meanwhile, didn't distract from the characters' conversations.And again, Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy gave reason for why you wanted or needed to care about these characters. Especially in the case of Jesse having a troubled marriage and Celine having relationship problems, the dialogue reflected situations you could sympathize with if not relate to. And this script had an upper hand on the original in that the characters were far more mature now with problems that went beyond finding themselves. The ending also had you guessing, will Jesse leave his wife for Celine after all? Will he make his flight out in the end? These questions are not even hinted at before the end of the film.Last but not least, Julie Delpy's songs cemented this film's memorability for me, especially her song 'A Waltz For A Night', which should have been nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song that year. It was just one of the reasons I kept watching this film until the very end, not even stopping in between to use the restroom. It's all a testament to Linklater's ear for an intriguing film that does not necessarily tell a story. 'Before Sunset' lives up to its hype, does not pander to unfamiliar audiences, and is just as good as the original.",9,1,1,9 February 2010
Across the Universe," A+ for Visual Effects and Musical Interpretation. The Rest? Eh . . .
","This being a movie about the music of the Beatles, and me being a big Beatles fan, it's unforgettable in terms of it's music and the visual effects. One strength this movie had was it's different interpretations of Beatles songs. I especially liked Prudence's version of 'I Want To Hold Your Hand' near the beginning of the movie. The set design and choreography were also very impressive.But unfortunately, for every strength this movie had, it's accurate to say that there were at least three hang-ups. This is where I'm at odds with other friends of mine who have seen the movie. It's not that I hated 'Across the Universe', it's just that I didn't love it because it had some very evident flaws. And I just remember leaving the movie feeling very disappointed about the movie's weaknesses, since they were so big.For one, the movie came off to me as too preachy, especially towards the end. The characters in the film, particularly Lucy and Max Carrigan, came off less as children of the '60's, and more as people I knew from college who smoked weed all the time and said, 'Man, I wished I lived in the '60's!' over and over again. I thought Jim Sturgess, who played Jude, was probably the best-developed and most believable character of everyone, but the rest of them felt like archetypes ripped and Xeroxed from Oliver Stone movies and Milos Forman's 'Hair'. You were supposed to feel bad for Max Carrigan (I think) for being drafted into Vietnam, but his character was such an asshole I found myself not really caring. Plus, the Vietnam scenes were so underdeveloped (Compared to other Vietnam War films such as 'Platoon' and 'Full Metal Jacket') and Max's character so forgotten by the end that I really felt the movie didn't have a message.Continuing on the subject of characters, I thought the characters of Jojo (played by Martin Luther McCoy) and Sadie (played by Joan Osbourne lookalike Dana Fuchs) were almost unnecessary. Even though Jojo's introduction via the very cool sequence with Joe Cocker singing 'Come Together' added some real light to this movie, I still didn't see the significance of characters that echoed Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin respectively. Sure, these two singers were huge influences of the 1960's, but this is a movie about Beatles music, right? I was especially lost when the Sadie character started off with Jojo's band, then went solo and got hooked on alcohol. Her successful recovery from all this was never explained in the end, which had me feeling a bit cheated when I turned off the movie.The characters of Jojo and Sadie really show what this movie's big flaw is: the movie makers tried to cram too much into a two hour movie. Too many characters, too many subplots, too many radical messages, and (sadly) too many Beatles songs. As a result, some Beatles songs that may have been powerful in another context tended to fall flat. One such example is the section of the movie beginning with Bono singing 'I Am The Walrus', and ending with Eddie Izzard's turn as Mr. Kite. That section of the movie was the exact moment where the movie lost it's message and said, 'Let's demonstrate the message of the '60's by having the main characters go on an acid trip'. It may have worked as a music video, but as a section of the movie it felt way too self-indulgent.Above all, the biggest problem I had with this movie was the idea that the main characters wrote the songs themselves. I would have liked to have seen even a cameo by Paul McCartney or Ringo Starr (perhaps not Yoko Ono), or even see the characters watching a live broadcast of one of their concerts. That would have made the movie feel a little more authentic to me, but of course, that is just my opinion.I reiterate when I say that this movie tried to bite off more than it could actually chew. It wasn't as bad as the Bee Gees' disastrous 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band', which is why I gave this movie a 6 out of 10 after very careful consideration. I was debating whether to give this movie a 4 out of 10. I'll admit that it was a very ambitious movie, but at times it seemed so ambitious to the point of being haughty and arrogant. Like many big budget science fiction hits of the 1990's, this movie was great on visual effects, but not so great on a coherent storyline and characters you actually cared about. I'll definitely buy the soundtrack, because the different versions of the Beatles songs were indeed awe-inspiring. The rest of the movie, I'm sorry to say, just didn't do it for me. I know other people will like it, though, and I respect their decisions.",6,3,4,4 April 2008
Kick-Ass," Does This Movie Kick Ass? Yes, mostly.
","A few dozen films come out every year that are hyped up to the point where you hear about them at least 20 times a day up until their theatrical release. 'Kick-Ass' is definitely one of those films. I was excited to see it, but I tried desperately to keep the preparation to be disappointed just so not to be let down. So without reading any reviews beforehand (which, for me, was like being on a deserted island and trying not to think about water), I kept this question in mind before and after the movie: Does 'Kick-Ass', in fact, kick ass?There were things I loved about 'Kick-Ass', most notably the story. The best way to really enjoy this film is if you know as little about it as possible, because the film has so many plot twists that would be shocking enough had it not been for the violence in this film. I'm a big action film fan myself, and there was seldom an action sequence in this film, aided by special effects or not, that didn't make me flinch. If you know nothing about this film going in, you will be entertained by the action alone, provided you're not faint of heart.I also love the premise of this movie, which was really well executed. I liked the idea that despite comic book movies being the biggest box office draw of the last decade (if you don't count 'Avatar' (2009), although that could have been based on a comic), very few real life people really have tried to be super heroes. There's a great dialogue in the beginning between high school geek and Kick-Ass to be Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) and his comic book loving pals (Clark Duke and Evan Peters) about why no one has really tried it in real life. They delve beyond the obvious reason (i.e. because no one really has super powers), and make some very good points that also remained hilarious.Dave, despite not being athletic in the slightest or knowing any fighting skills of any kind, somehow becomes motivated enough to buy a green and yellow wetsuit online, and use that as his superhero costume. Without giving too much away, he never really wins a fight, but becomes a YouTube sensation, attracting the unwanted attention of a mob boss Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), and perhaps the wanted attention of real life superheroes Hit-Girl (11-year-old Chloe Grace Moretz) and Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage).It's when this father and daughter team come into the story that the film delves into unpredictable territory and enhances the story. A lot of controversy has been made about Moretz's language in the film. Truth be told, she only says about three or four swear words throughout the film. Some reviews I couldn't avoid made her out to have Joe Pesci dialogue. Truth be told, the scenes where she's killing people are far more intense than her PG-13 language. Overall, though, Moretz was a welcome presence on screen whose was well developed as a character and exhibited a lot of charm throughout the film. She was funny and unexpectedly warm in '500 Days of Summer' (2009), and she's the same in this movie on a different level.I also didn't expect to like Cage's character as much as I did. The scenes between him and Moretz are never dull, often times funny, and surprisingly poignant even when he shoots her point blank in the chest (you have to see the movie). Cage really could have hammed this role up to the extreme, and given that he wears glasses in this film, I half expected him to use that annoying nasally voice he used in 'Peggy Sue Got Married' (1986). Fortunately, his performance in this movie was over the top enough so much so that you still cared enough about the character. There's even a great scene that's animated comic book style which gives the background of Cage's character. Once you see that scene, which tells an awesome story in and of itself, your sympathy points are hooked on Big Daddy and never let go.Soon enough, another faux superhero falls into the mix, namely Kick-Ass' high school acquaintance Chris D'Amico, who becomes Red Mist by night and is played by Christopher 'McLovin' Mintz-Plasse. As much as I thought Mintz-Plasse was funny in films like 'Superbad' (2007), I felt like here he was miscast. There's a twist to his character that you learn not from watching the previews, but one quarter of the way through the film. His character is important and adds to the story, but I found myself not knowing whether he was supposed to be funny or not, and neither did the people who were in the theater with me. I felt as though the lines he spoke that were meant to be funny fell flat, and the nasally voice that worked for him as McLovin felt out of place here. I didn't feel he was meant to be a nerdy character in this movie, and he just felt out of place. Another actor could have played him better.Revealing more about this film would take away the sheer thrill of it. Skip the reviews (except this one, of course) and go see it. There is seldom a dull moment in this film. The violence is very graphic, but always contributes to the story. The acting is very good so much so that you care about all the characters. I thought a few lines felt flat and uninspired here and there, but I recommend 'Kick-Ass' because it kicked ass for the most part. It's violent and vulgar in many areas, making its R-rating well deserved. It's still entertaining as hell without succumbing to mindlessness, and should be viewed on the big screen. I recommend it!",8,4,15,17 April 2010
Avatar," 'Avatar' is Better Than Good, and Even Better Than 'Titanic'
","Many critics who have reviewed 'Avatar' said that they initially didn't know what to expect going in. I bring this point up because I felt the exact same way. I'd seen posters for the movie, and previews for it in the previous months before it was released, but did not know what it was about, let alone if I would like it or not. In fact, I was so unsure how I would feel about it that I saw 'Sherlock Holmes' before I saw 'Avatar'. All I knew about the movie was that it was about blue, cat-like creatures, and it was directed by James Cameron, a guy who is very easy to dislike as a person. After all, 'Titanic' broke many records, but eventually came to be seen as bombastic and meretricious. Cameron's declaring himself 'king of the world' at the Oscars didn't help much, nor did his immediate public divorce from Linda Hamilton, or his long stretch of not directing a followup feature film (save the forgotten 'Ghosts of a Abyss' (2003) that should have been called 'The Making of Titanic', and 'Aliens of the Deep' (2005)).However, after seeing 'Avatar', I can honestly say that there was not one inch of celluloid that was wasted in this film. Cameron may not be a nice guy, but when he wants to tell a story, he can tell it and not waste a dollar of his $250 million budget. As I serve myself a piece of humble pie, I'll even add that he probably does not care what an amateur, unestablished 27- year-old film critic thinks about him, and that's a good thing.I went to see 'Avatar' in 3D (which is well worth the extra 3 bucks, depending on the movie), and I was afraid to blink in case I missed something. This is an epic movie well-deserving of the term 'epic'. Any time there is a scene where a helicopter is flying out into the Pandora wilderness, or even inside in the scientific lab or Marine base, I was taken aback by the design and the detail of everything I saw on screen. Nowadays, saying that a movie has great special effects is synonymous with explosions and societal destruction compromising the majority of the film. 'Avatar' indeed has great special effects, and those latter elements represent a small percentage of the film.Naturally, like 'Titanic', many people I spoke to had problems with the acting and the story line. One person I know called the movie ''Dances With Wolves' In Space', which I suppose it was. I also saw similarities to 'Ferngully: The Last Rainforest' (1992) and 'Pocahontas' (1995), but by no means was the story a blatant ripoff of any of these films. I did think the villainous characters like Colonal Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and Parker Selfrige (Giovanni Ribisi) made the Native American allegory too obvious by frequently calling the Na'vi creatures 'savages'. It made their characters also seem one-dimensional, and they obviously hadn't been taught about the Battle of Little Bighorn in school.Other than that, I thought the acting was fine. Except for a few times his British accent slipped through, Sam Worthington had both a commanding presence throughout the film while also being a convincing moral compass. There haven't been many actors who can pull that off while playing a paraplegic. Sigourney Weaver, being no alien when it comes to science fiction roles, also did a great job here. And Joel David Moore was perhaps the breakout star of this film, doing a great acting job that truly redeems his role in 'The Hottie and the Nottie' (2008). Lang's role as the hard-ass colonel may have been seen in other movies before, but there is no doubt that Lang knows how to play a great bad guy.Zoe Saldana, Wes Studi, and CCH Pounder essentially did voice-over work in their roles here as the native Na'vi of the planet Pandora. Still, there was not one second where their voices were not convincing. Saldana especially cemented her position as a convincing leading actress while not appearing as a human on the screen at all. I don't have to say that she deserves to be an A-lister. She will be very soon if she isn't considered one already.'Avatar' deserves no less than 9 stars in my book. I usually give 10 stars to movies that are not only great, but really move me in some way. 'Avatar' had a few weaknesses, but not enough to deduct a star from my rating. It was an enjoyable film that moved me on more than one level. I felt compassion for the characters, marveled at the scenery and special effects, and most importantly, didn't get up to go to the bathroom once during the film. When I went to see 'Titanic' 12 years ago, on the other hand, I got up three times to go.James Cameron wisely made the reported $237 million it took to make 'Avatar' worth every penny. Fortunately, I wisely made the $14.50 I paid to see it in 3D worth every penny as well.",10,25,41,15 January 2010
Up," A Movie Made for 3D Animation- Great Fantasy Film Overall
","I'll be honest. I was prepared to be disappointed when I went in to see this film. As I said in my review for 'Wall-E' last year (which is at this link if you want to read it: 'http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910970/usercomments-293'), Pixar is the only 3D animation studio that has not made a bad or even mediocre film yet. I was a bit skeptical about 'Up' not because of the recent news that Disney is worrying about its commercial appeal, not because of the unrealistic plot elements (and there are some), but because after nine great movies, a misfire could be on the horizon. Fortunately, 'Up' is far from a misfire. Like the other Pixar movies, it takes an intriguing, original plot line and creates a masterpiece of a story with humor and heart.The main character of this story is someone who has the least potential to be made into an action figure, which is probably what is making Disney stockholders nervous as of the date this review is being written. Carl Frederickson is reminiscent of Peter 'Ralphie' Billingsley (from 'A Christmas Story' [1983]) as a child, and a cross between James Whitmore and Mr. Magoo as an elderly man. Although his image won't send kids flocking to toy stores, it doesn't really matter. Some great movies have been made with senior citizens as the main characters ('Cocoon' [1985] and 'Bubba Ho-Tep' [2002] come particularly to mind), and it's about time Disney make one.The most appealing thing about Carl Frederickson is his character. From the moment he appears on screen, audiences immediately get a sense of his happy times and times of loneliness through a clever series of montages in the beginning. There were probably many old men in Hollywood who could have supplied his voice, but Ed Asner was perhaps the best choice. Asner gives Frederickson a voice that is curmudgeonly without being too off-putting, similar to his Lou Grant character from 1970's TV.In the first 20 minutes of the movie, you grow such an attachment to Mr. Frederickson that you can't help but feel like cheering when his house takes off with the help of balloons he spent all night blowing up. Therein lies the point of the movie where you really have to suspend disbelief. Of course this number of balloons can't pick up an entire house, let alone be blown up in one night without really careful planning. And if you spend too much time wondering how the floor of the house didn't stay on the ground, along with the pictures and other breakable assets in the dwelling, you will miss the point of the movie, not to mention the fun of it. The house is really a symbol of seeking new adventures while hanging on to where you came from all along, at least at first.The basic premise expands with the addition of Wilderness Explorer (or Boy Scout, minus the legal ramifications) Russell, arguably the Donkey to Mr. Frederickson's Shrek (sorry, Disney, but it's true). Russell is a very funny character, and doesn't miss a beat from the moment he comes on screen reading his Explorer book verbatim. The two main characters played off each other very well with witty dialogue and precise comic timing. Take away the comic relief of the talking dogs, and the down-to-the-hair strand awesome CGI animation, and you'd still have a great film with these two characters alone. The Russell character simultaneously adds a lot of well-needed heart to the film, actually making even me feel bad for the potential extinction of the otherwise annoying bird companion Kevin.In an emerging subplot, Kevin the bird is hunted down by a Charles Lindbergh/Howard Hughes-inspired adventurer named Charles Muntz, voiced with the right touch of menace by Christopher Plummer. The Muntz character is perhaps the first Disney villain who you don't want to be a villain, especially after seeing the faux newsreel clips in the beginning of the movie. He's a self-made man who's spent his life chasing a dream, sort of like Mr. Frederickson is by dragging his house to South America. He's also killing a bird that many, including Frederickson, finds annoying. However, if it hadn't been for the perfect moral balance between him and Russell, it would have been very hard to root for Mr. Frederickson until the end.The movie, on the whole, is probably more over-the-top than any other Pixar film made to date. You know many kids in America have a toy collection as diverse as the ones Andy has in 'Toy Story', and that humans could create a smart robot like 'Wall-E' someday. But anyone who spends their time wondering how Mr. Frederickson planned to survive after moving his house to the South American clip, or how the hose he's pulling doesn't break off the house, is missing a great fantasy adventure with many awe-inspiring takes on life. To paraphrase the theme song to 'Mystery Science Theater 3000': 'If you're wondering how he eats and breathes, and other science facts, repeat to yourself 'It's just a show, and I should really just relax'.' On a personal note, having just lost a grandparent who, in the last years of her life, refused to go to a nursing home because she loved the house she had lived in for nearly 40 years, I'm sure the setup of the story will strike familiar tones with many older audience members. I know it did with me, which is why the film was so touching and heartfelt from beginning to end. Hey, I may even be in that situation one day where I love a house so much I would even consider flying it away. If I actually considered doing it, I would hope that 50 years from now they would have more advanced flying equipment to do it with.",9,3,6,30 May 2009
There Will Be Blood," Legendary performance by Daniel Day-Lewis
","I can't say that Daniel Day-Lewis's performance alone made this movie great. The movie was itself great in a lot of ways, including the directing by Paul Thomas Anderson (who I don't believe has made a bad movie to date), the cinematography, and the intriguing storyline. However, I can't think of any other actor who would have done as well in the role of Daniel Plainview. Day-Lewis really moved his actor status up to legendary with this role, and it's a good thing Martin Scorsese talked him out of retirement seven years ago to do 'Gangs of New York'.Perhaps the other best things about this movie is that it doesn't follow the typical storyline you would expect from this sort of movie. I expected this movie to be a rise-and-fall story along the lines of 'Boogie Nights', where Daniel Plainview works hard to get oil, gets money, and becomes more corrupt. And I thought a subplot involves the Eli Sunday character (played extremely well in an overlooked performance by Paul Dano) would be the moral center of the story who resists corruption. That doesn't exactly happen that way. In fact, without giving anything away, there are more scenes than expected where Daniel Plainview is portrayed as a more noble character than Eli Sunday. Additionally, Daniel Day-Lewis brings an unexpected amount of comic relief to Plainview that not many other actors would be willing to muster.It's unfortunate that this film is nominated for Best Picture against 'No Country for Old Men' and 'Juno', both excellent films that I have seen as of January 30th, 2008. Despite this film being 2 1/2 hours long, I enjoyed it all the way through. If it doesn't win Best Picture, Daniel Day-Lewis definitely deserves to win for Best Actor (say that five times fast). Great film overall, and excellent period piece!",10,2,6,30 January 2008
The Wolf of Wall Street," 'The Wolf of Wall Street' Smiles, But Shows No Teeth
","'The Wolf of Wall Street' is tremendously entertaining. When watching this movie in a theater, and you resist using the bathroom even after imbibing a medium Cherry Coke, you know it is the sign of exceptional storytelling.This movie's narrative structure is similar to 'Goodfellas' (1990) and 'Boogie Nights' (1997) in that the first half of the film is fun to watch as you witness the rise of the antihero protagonist and the supporting players. Especially if you greatly dislike the protagonist and resent his rise to power, if the second half is hard to watch, you know you are seeing something good.However, although the story arc is similar, it's not quite as great as the aforementioned films. Granted you witness great acting from almost everyone involved, and eye-opening moments.Unfortunately, the movie never got past the excesses and to the true consequences of the protagonist's actions. Even then, the movie seemed to be mostly preoccupied with the high lives these stock-brokers were living, and virtually ignored the lives they ruined on their way to the top.Leonardo DiCaprio is Jordan Belfort, an ambitious man who takes a job as a stockbroker on Wall Street. Unfortunately, despite having a dynamic mentor (played by a superb, scene-stealing Matthew McConaughey), it is 1987, and the stock market takes a plunge that puts him of work.Soon afterwords, he takes a modest job in a boiler room selling penny stocks. It turns out that Belfort is not just good at selling these worthless intangibles: he's great at it.Eventually, he starts his own company with shady children's furniture salesman Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) and other compatriots from the boiler room, where they employ the pump and dump scam to their advantage. When they amass enough money, they begin to give their firm a respectable name, Stratton Oakmont, and make money hand over fist using the same marauding techniques, only on a larger scale.I'll be the first to admit that stock trading and the tribulations of Wall Street are very foreign to me. If I see a movie like 'Wall Street', I don't know what the numbers scrolling across the NYSE mean. I could only rely on the faces of Michael Douglass or Charlie Sheen to know if the overall news was good or not.To the film's credit, I could understand how Stratton Oakmont amassed their wealth. I can also understand the illegality of their trade, and I'm certain that most audience members with no Wall Street familiarity will not be lost.Even if one hates these people for their avarice, and the immoral and reprehensible lives that they lead as a result of their accumulated fortune, one cannot deny how entertaining it is to watch these shenanigans. Their charades may not be appealing, especially when the Securities and Exchange Commission begins to take note of their activities, but they are still engrossing.However, the party lasts a little too long at a running time of 180 minutes. This movie could have easily been cut back 40 minutes by taking out a party scene or two. Another scene where Belfort meets with corrupt Swiss banker Jean-Jacques Saurel (Jean Dujardin) could also have been shortened significantly.Plus, with these people living so high off their riches, it is impossible to believe that no one got hurt financially in the process. Belfort lived the high life (both figuratively because of his wealth, and literally because of his excessive drug use), but there had to have been lives that were ruined because of his schemes.Still, as far as acting goes, DiCaprio himself owns this film, and it definitely is among his best performances. His breaking the fourth wall is done enough so that it is not redundant, and his motivational speeches to his firm members are incredibly over-the-top, but appropriately so given his character.Jonah Hill was decent as Belfort's right hand man, although his performance sometimes became a little too comically inappropriate, as if he was playing the fat guy who falls on his face the same way he has done in lesser comedies (excluding 'Superbad' (2007) and '21 Jump Street'). However, the scene where he nearly chokes to death when high on Quaalude was scary for me to watch.That same scene, where Belfort is also dramatically debilitated from the same kind of Quaalude, received some laughs from the audience in my theater, but I didn't find the scene funny at all. It was one of the most memorable drug scenes I've seen in a mainstream movie, but like Uma Thurman's heroin overdose moment in 'Pulp Fiction' (1994), and Julianne Moore's hyper, heartbreaking, high-on-cocaine 'too many things' scene in 'Boogie Nights' (1997), it made me never want to try drugs.On top of stand-out performances by Margot Robbie as Belfort's trophy wife, Rob Reiner as Belfort's profane and no-nonsense father, and McConaughey's brief but memorable role, the ensemble cast succeeded for the most part in making greed look ugly. When the firm hits their chests and chant an innocuous but catchy quasi-tribal tune, they make true fools out of themselves, but are too busy conforming to care.While 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is a memorable movie, it doesn't quite reach the emotional depths of director Martin Scorsese's previous movies like 'Raging Bull' or 'Goodfellas'. In the latter film, when Henry Hill's life takes a turn for the worst, you can feel him crash and burn.Here, Jordan Belfort eventually falls, but appears to hit a bed of roses. He story ends with consequences, but he just ends up not as wealthy as he used to be.This movie leaves with the implication that Belfort lived his high life so well that the tab he had to pay wasn't all that steep. Somebody had to pay the rest of that bill, and probably did, but you wouldn't know it from seeing it here.",8,0,2,4 February 2015
Inception," In a Decade, 'Inception' May Be A Religion
","Films about dreams and the subconscious are usually not very straightforward and almost always weird. 'Inception' is no exception to that rule, but like its cinematic predecessors who have explored the contrast between and the questions of what is real and what is illusion (i.e. 'The Matrix' (1999), 'The Cell' (2000), 'Abre Los Ojos' (1997) & its American remake 'Vanilla Sky' (2001)), you really can't look away, nor should you.'Inception' is an excellent and breathtaking movie that may be one of the only films released so far during the Summer of 2010 that lives up to its hype. It is a nearly perfect and highly original film that holds your attention until the credits roll. The less you know about this movie going in, the more you will be entranced by seeing it.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a world class criminal who, with the help of a team of sleep experts, works his way into people's subconscious and steals what people value most: ideas directly from their minds. In his last assignment to possibly clear his name, he is assigned not to steal an idea from someone, but to plant one inside that person's mind. The difficulty comes when certain people are trained to block their ideas from being taken.That plot summary only covers the basics of this pretty complicated story, but to describe every plot detail would take away the magic of this film you must see yourself to believe. DiCaprio is good in his role, but unlike many other films he has starred in, this is perhaps his only role where his character alone does not carry the weight of the movie on his shoulders or share it equally with one other co-star. Instead, this great ensemble cast teams together to make this movie work, just as their characters collaborate to pull off such a unique heist. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy are especially good in their roles.The special effects in this film were also very good, which is amazing considering their simplicity compared to the 'Matrix' movies. There are slow-motion shots, but no impossible kung fu fighting sequences. It's especially interesting when the film gets into the architecture of certain dreams, and impossible sequences are filmed in a way I've never seen other than in drawings.However, the special effects would mean nothing if the story wasn't good. For this reason, even something as simple as a spinning top holds your attention in a way you would never think it would when seeing it in this film. The credit here can be given to writer and director Christopher Nolan, who has not made a bad film yet. There are many twists and turns in this film, but Nolan never loses his focus in the process of telling the story. If Nolan does not get nominated for Best Director and/or Best Original Screenplay next Oscar season, there is something terribly wrong with the Academy.That being said, there was still a lot about this film I still don't get, and may require multiple viewings to better understand. However, some of the best films I've seen are confusing at first. '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968) is a film I've seen a couple of times, and still don't understand completely. It still has a major following, though, as I'm positive this movie will. It's an incredibly entertaining movie, but it also makes you think and continues to do so after you leave the theater.",10,1242,1961,13 July 2010
WALL¬∑E," Pixar's Most Frank Movie . . . And Probably Their Best
","I loved WALL-E. I've reviewed a number of CGI films on IMDb before, and I always make it clear that an animated movie made with computers doesn't automatically make it good, let alone great. Having said that, Pixar, in my opinion, has yet to make a mediocre movie. The closest they have come to mediocrity is 'A Bug's Life', and I would probably rate that movie with 8 out of 10 stars. It was a well animated film with witty dialogue and intriguing characters, but it didn't top either 'Toy Story' movie or even movies that came after it like 'Finding Nemo'. WALL-E, on the other hand, has achieved the impossible by being so unique and original that it actually tops its animated predecessors by (dare I say it) boldly going where no family movie has gone before.I use that Star Trek-based clich√© reluctantly, since I consider myself the anti-Trekkie (i.e. I HATE Star Trek with a passion). However, it's appropriate not only because this is a science fiction film that takes place mostly in space, but because it paints a surprisingly bleaker picture of the future than you would expect from a Disney film. The future in this movie is not so bleak that it would depress younger viewers, but it serves as an appropriate cautionary tale in a lot of instances. More on that later.The character of WALL-E is reminiscent of a lot of famous sci-fi characters including R2-D2, E.T., and Short Circuit, but is in no way a rip-off of any of them. I thought it was brilliant that WALL-E spoke volumes about his personality with his actions without actually speaking at all. He was a lovable character, and will undoubtedly be a true Disney icon for years to come. Some people called the love story between him and the more advanced robot EVA (or EVE. I can't remember which) was corny, but I thought it was a great starting point to an even broader storyline.Of course, from watching the previews, everyone knew about the robot love story, and how WALL-E finally hitches a ride off of abandoned Earth. What was unexpected to me was the bleak vision of humanity in the future. I saw two of the passengers aboard the cruise ship upon WALL-E's arrival, and certainly didn't expect to see humans in that bad shape in a Disney film. The scenes showing the humans on the galactic cruise ship reminded me both of 'Idiocracy' (2005), and 'Super Size Me' (2004), both of which are cautionary movies not made for kids. However, as stated earlier, this movie could probably serve as a lesson for kids: don't over-consume, don't turn on, tune in and drop out, and get up and get out frequently. Coming from a major company which has been blamed by some for the obesity crisis in America today (especially in its historical ties to McDonald's), that's a bold message which I applaud.I also liked the subplot showing the eventual struggle the ship's captain faced with the robot who ran everything on the ship. I was immediately reminded of HAL from '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968), although this movie was most definitely '2001' with a dash of hope. If Stanley Kubrick lived to see this movie, I'm not sure how he would like it. I know that Al Gore would probably love it, since this movie also borrows themes explored in 'An Inconvenient Truth' (2006) as well.But of course, in relation to that topic, this movie is pro-environmentalism without being too preachy, pro-humanity and pro-physical fitness without being too depressing, and pro-technology under the condition that it not control our lives too much. Through it all, it tells a great story while managing to have arguably the least dialogue of any full-length feature film, let alone those made by Disney and/or Pixar. Furthermore, although WALL-E takes inspiration from other great movies I listed above (i.e., '2001: A Space Oddity', 'E.T.', etc.), and perhaps even from Ray Bradbury's 'The Martian Chronicles', it's still a very unique film that maintains its originality.At the Academy Awards this next year, this movie should actually be nominated for Best Picture. I can't say enough good things about it. I highly recommend it, and will purchase it immediately upon its release on DVD. It is by far the best summer movie of the year, and I have no doubt it will be in the Top Ten for movies this year.",10,1,4,4 July 2008
The Terminal," Excellent, Underrated Film- The 'It's A Wonderful Life' of the 21st Century
","'The Terminal' is a movie that opened in theaters in the summer of 2004, quickly disappeared, and has sort of gotten a bad rap ever since. I saw it on DVD in November 2004, shortly before Thanksgiving, and absolutely fell in love with the film. I say it's the 'It's A Wonderful Life' of the 21st Century because the two films have a lot in common. They were both directed by A-List directors, had an A-List actor as the lead, are feel good films, initially didn't do as well at the box office as they should have, and would not seem out of place when played during the holidays. In at least a decade from now, this film will be considered a modern day classic. Mark my words.So why was it so great? First and foremost, Tom Hanks played Viktor Navorski so well, and sold every scene he was in. Hanks never played a foreigner before, or at least not one that didn't speak much English. Here, he pulled off something not many other actors could do. Not only did his character not speak very much English, but you could really see in Hanks' eyes the fear, confusion, and oblivion of being stranded in a foreign country with little means, and through no fault of his own. There aren't many other American actors who could do that good a job at acting the role so convincingly.Stanley Tucci was also relatively flawless in his performance as Frank Dixon, director of the Homeland Security branch of the JFK Airport. Tucci has a difficult role here as the straight man, not to mention the occasional bad guy in some situations. However, Tucci never misses a beat, and this role could be regarded as his best so far. Often times, I found myself wondering why Frank Dixon wanted Navorski out of the terminal, then towards the end didn't want him to go to New York. I'm sure there's an explanation somewhere, but this one plot inconsistency didn't ruin my enjoyment of the film at all.The interactions between Frank Dixon and Viktor Navorski are classic, and often times very funny. Probably the best scene between him and Hanks, besides when they first meet, are when Hanks is brought in to translate for the Russian immigrant with pills for his father. Very few scenes make me laugh and cry at the same time, but that one is one of them. It's just a truly remarkable and poignant scene.Also noteworthy in scenes with both Tucci and Hanks is Barry Shabaka Henley, who played chief officer Thurman. Henley is one of those character actors whose name isn't known, but you immediately see him and say, 'Yeah, I remember him. He was in 'Collateral', and he was also in 'What's Love Got To Do With It''. He's a good actor, and really shines in this movie.Additionally, Catherine Zeta-Jones was pretty good in her role. Her character kind of came and went, but she played well opposite Hanks and there was an interesting love story there until the end. Chi McBride, Diego Luna, and Kumar Pallana also provided some great comic relief, but also scenes of heartbreaking poignancy.Apart from the acting, the set design was incredible. Research shows that the movie was shot almost entirely on a set, not in the JFK Airport. If I hadn't researched that fact myself, I wouldn't have known. Some may argue that showing the stores such as the Sharper Image, Burger King, and Borders were shameful product placement, but they really added a hugely realistic element to the movie.For a movie with a moderately big budget ($60 million), it's surprising to me that the DVD release of the film (at least initially) has a nice menu, but no special features whatsoever. There's no 'making of' documentaries (although one did air on HBO prior to the film's release), no director's or actor's commentary, and no deleted scenes. Regardless, it's a DVD that I make it a point to watch at least once a year, if not twice (and I watch a lot of movies, mind you). It's just that good. Besides the acting and the set design, the movie just tells an excellent story. It has not gotten the credit it deserves yet, but it will soon. It's a superb film, and I highly recommend it. Easily one of the best films of this decade (2000-2009) so far.",10,4,8,26 January 2009
Space Jam," An Energetic, Enjoyable, Altogether Fun Movie With Great Animation
","This may sound pathetic, but of all the films I have seen (and I have seen many), 'Space Jam' holds a special place in my heart. It's actually the first film I saw by myself at the movie theaters. I liked it when I was 14, but I always make sure when I write a review that I see a movie more recently. Movies as I remember them are not always what they are.Fourteen years later, even though Michael Jordan has retired and CGI animation reigns supreme, 'Space Jam' still stands up. Critics may label it a kid's movie, but its dialogue is funny and far from intelligence insulting. Plus, I thought the overall story was creative and inventive, although a little weird and out there sometimes. But hey, aren't all Looney Tunes a little weird and out there? Aren't those characteristics what has made them relevant throughout many generations?I loved the fact that this movie could have been a vanity piece for Michael Jordan, but it wasn't. The temptation must have been there to make a movie similar to Muhammad Ali's mediocre 'The Greatest' (1977). After all, Jordan was at the height of his popularity at the time this movie was released, and the Chicago Bulls had just won the NBA Finals that year (with two more championship wins to come).With the Looney Tunes added into the mix, you get a far more creative premise. I really liked how the movie took place circa 1993-1995, from when Jordan retired from the NBA to his notorious stint playing minor league baseball for the Birmingham Barons (a farm team for the Chicago White Sox) to his triumphant return to the Bulls. I would really like to know how the premise came about to have the Looney Tunes characters persuade Jordan to take up basketball again. It doesn't matter who came up with it or how. It was just weaved into the real life story very creatively.As random a plot as it is, the Looney Tunes live in a cartoon community underneath the Earth, and puny aliens from a failing intergalactic amusement park called Moron Mountain come to abduct the cartoon characters for their next attraction. These aliens are not very smart, prompting the clever Bugs Bunny to convince them to challenge the Looney Tunes to a basketball game instead of immediately kidnapping them. The aliens agree, except they also apparently have the ability to steal basketball playing ability (or talent) from real NBA players. Each of the five aliens gets into the brains of Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson, Muggsy Bogues, and Shawn Bradley, and steal their talent. Apparently, this also gives the aliens the ability to shape shift and become large monsters, or 'MonSTARS', as they are known here.If you really try to insert logic into this plot, you're going to hate this movie. Looney Tunes cartoons were never logical, so why should this plot be? They were always funny and entertaining, and so is this movie.Once Michael Jordan enters their cartoon world, it's amazing how well he interacts with the characters. Perhaps the best scene is when Bugs Bunny kisses Jordan, and the reaction from him that follows. Jordan's not a great actor, obviously, but you really forget while you're watching this movie that he is actually in front of a green screen not talking to anyone. This is by far the best live action and animation combination since 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' (1988).There's really little to fault this movie on. It's funny both in animation and real life. Wayne Knight as pushy publicist Stan Podolak was very funny, and Bill Murray (as himself) was especially hilarious, particularly when he joins the Tune Squad. I still love how Daffy Duck asked him how he got to the cartoon world, and he says (in typical Bill Murray style), 'Oh, the producer's a friend of mine. I had one of the teamster's drop me off.' It gets me every time.I highly recommend 'Space Jam'. It is one of the best kids movies ever made, its story is random, but solid, and its a highly enjoyable film, not to mention a fitting tribute to the Looney Tunes and the NBA glory days of the 1990's. And this movie managed to pull this off without letting product placement or short term endorsements get in the way. That feat is still incredible.",9,1,1,25 August 2010
Before Sunrise," A Rarity: An Intelligent Love Story Without a Drop of Sap
","Richard Linklater isn't a household name the way other directors are like Stephen Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, and Woody Allen. Nonetheless, he's directed a number of very intriguing films over the last two decades, though what's rare about him (and perhaps is the reason why his name isn't quite as well known) is that almost no two of his films are alike. Those moviegoers who pay attention (like me) would notice that what connects all his films, from 'Slacker' (1991) and 'Dazed and Confused' (1993) to 'A Scanner Darkly' (2006) and 'Waking Life' (2001), is Linklater's knack for character developing by way of believable and profound dialogue. The words of these characters are not only well-written, but the actors playing them almost never sound as though they are actually acting when speaking them.That's why I was surprised that all of the words spoken by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in 'Before Sunrise' were actually written, and not by the two actors themselves. Hawke and Delpy are not playing themselves, either. Hawke is Jesse, an American tourist in his late 20's who is on a trip across Europe to find himself, if you will. On his way to Vienna, Austria, where he plans to take a plane back to the States the next day, he meets Celine (Delpy), a French student around his age who is on her way back to France on the same train. As Jesse is about to get off in Austria, he persuades Celine to accompany him through Vienna, and they get to know each other as they travel the city, and are well aware it will be their only night together, if not their last for a long time.The chemistry between Hawke and Delpy is incredible, and through very long shots of them talking, you never see them look at cue cards or try any trick to make them remember their lines. I felt as though I was eavesdropping on an actual conversation. Remarkably enough, Linklater and Kim Krizan wrote all their dialogue. There may have been moments of improvisation here and there, but the dialogue evenly flowed throughout the film regardless of the source.A good 90% of the film involved Hawke and Delpy talking, but by no means was the film boring for many reasons. First of all, the city of Vienna, where the film was shot on location, seemed to serve as a third character the same way Chicago did for 'The Blues Brothers' (1980), or Idaho did for 'Napoleon Dynamite' (2004). Somehow the places that Jesse and Celine spontaneously walked to were all interesting despite there being no panoramic shots (except at the end, in a unique montage showing the places where the two characters had gone). Regardless of Linklater's intentions of choosing Vienna as the film's location, the city held its own with its particular attributes that differentiated it from anywhere else in the world, let alone Europe.Second, the main characters were not only likable, but had that undeniable charisma that made their dialogue worth listening to. Each character also revealed enough about their background to keep audiences intrigued, and Linklater was wise not to cut to B-roll footage when these characters were telling their stories. Such a move would have insulted the intelligence of the audience, but other modern directors underestimate the attention spans of their intended audiences unfortunately.Third, throughout the film until its conclusion, I wondered if these characters would actually meet again, and in what circumstances. Of course, that question is officially answered in the sequel that would be released nine years later, 'Before Sunset'. Not taking that film into account, you want these characters to meet again, but you also know that they're making the most of time they know is limited. That level of intrigue is enough to sustain any attention span, and makes for one of the most unique romantic movies ever made (even still).",9,1,2,9 February 2010
Click," 'Click' Is A Clunker, & Adam Sandler's Most Disappointing Movie
","Every time I think about the movie 'Click', I can't help but get angry, as if I had been cheated into watching it in the first place. I don't know if it's Adam Sandler's worst movie, but it is by far his most disappointing.Basically, when I first went to see the film in June of 2006, I went in expecting a comedy, which is what I got for the first half of the film. The second half, however, was when the film not only became unfunny, but it ventured into such sad, dark, and depressing territory. By the end, I felt as though I had been tricked into seeing a better film.In this movie, Sandler plays Michael Newman, a happily-married architect whose main problem is his boss (David Hasselhoff), who repeatedly puts him on time-sensitive assignments to the point where he doesn't spend the time with his wife and kids that he would like to. His family, particularly his wife Donna (Kate Beckinsale), doesn't seem to be the least sympathetic to the fact that he has to work to support the family, which is a theme also prevalent in other forgettable comedies of yesteryear like 'Multiplicity' and 'Jingle All The Way' (both 1996).Late one night, Michael goes out the the nearest available store to find a universal remote. In an admittedly creative way to incorporate product placement into a film, he drives by various outlet stores until venturing into Bed, Bath, and Beyond. Finding a door marked 'Beyond' in the store, he walks through and meets an eccentric electrician named Morty (Christopher Walken, probably the best thing about the film). Morty gives Michael a blue remote control without a box or any instructions, and just tells him to 'Point, and Click' to make it work.As these movies go, Michael finds that he can control time and other things with this remote. It's pretty creative how the remote works, especially when he can see aspects of his life through DVD special features. I though the 'Making Of' section of Michael's life was funny particularly. There are also some funny parts where he adjusts the color of himself using the remote.However, the movie really loses its common sense, and its humor, when Sandler's character uses the Fast Forward button for various situations. Admittedly, the movie had a good way of covering up what could be a major plot hole. If you fast forward through time, what would you be doing in the eyes of everyone else around you? Would you just be standing there, moving slowly?So goes the concept of being on 'auto pilot', where Michael goes through the motions of what he's supposed to be doing in a given place and time, but without any kind of emotion. Being in auto pilot allows him to complete his architectural work, but gradually he loses touch with his wife and kids.With that plot hole covered up, many other holes emerge when Morty reveals that the remote programs itself to automatically fast forward time according to Michael's previous commands. So when Michael fast forwarded through his cold, the remote fast forwards through other times he was sick. When his wife argues with him, ditto.Eventually, in a scene that really made me want to cry out loud, Sandler finds himself accidentally in the year 2017, where he is morbidly obese (in a fat suit that resembles Fat Bastard in the 'Austin Powers' movies), divorced, living alone, and estranged from his family.From this point, you can tell the film is blatantly ripping off 'A Christmas Carol' and 'It's A Wonderful Life', although you may be too depressed to notice. There are funny parts thrown into these later scenes, but they are blatantly crushed by the weight of the all too heavy drama in which the film finds itself.All I could do was get angry at Sandler, or at least his character, and wonder how you can screw up this royally if you have all the power in the world in one hand. Plus, if I had a magic remote in this situation, you know what I would do: USE THE PAUSE BUTTON. Why it never occurs to this character to pause time and do his architectural work is beyond me.If you're going to make a goofy comedy where David Hasselhoff is your boss, it's best to keep it funny throughout. When you throw in an exhausting cautionary tale about the meaning of life and the importance of family, you just lose credibility. Seeing this movie made me want to use a magic remote to rewind time and stop my past self from paying to see this movie. I would not mind seeing a movie solely about Morty, however, provided Christopher Walken doesn't play Russian Roulette with audience's expectations.",4,1,2,6 June 2011
Happy Feet," I loved loved LOVED this movie!
","I have to say that when you have an animated film where one of the voices is Robin Williams, you can't really go wrong. When he's the voice of one of the characters, you can usually tell it's an exceptional animated movie. It was true for 'Aladdin', 'Ferngully: The Last Rainforest', and 'Robots', and this movie is no exception.There aren't enough good things to say about this movie. The story line was intriguing, the animation was phenomenal, the music was excellent and fit the story surprisingly well, the vocal acting was tremendous, and the message of the movie was great. This movie is up there with 'Toy Story' and 'Shrek' as one of the best computer animated films ever made.I'm pretty critical when it comes to movies too. In fact, I know from seeing many recent animated films that just because a movie is computer animated and all-star celebrities voice the characters doesn't make it a great movie. It was true for 'Doogal', which had a slew of A-List talent but wasn't very good otherwise.If there was one thing I'd change about the movie, though, it would be how the characters looked. I didn't like the fact that every penguin except Mumble looked exactly alike. That doesn't mean I'd bring my rating down from a 10 to a 9, because the realness of these penguins in image and movement compensated for this slight grievance.I was a little worried in the beginning, too, when Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman were singing 'Kiss' by Prince. I thought this movie was going to be an animated 'Moulin Rouge' with the same plot line. Although all of the music was taken from other sources, the music and the movement of the penguins made me want to get up and dance, or at least take tap dancing lessons somewhere in the near future. The song that fit especially well in this movie is 'Jump, Move' by the Brand New Heavies, with 'I Wish' by Stevie Wonder coming in a close second.In short, I would definitely recommend this film to everyone. If you didn't like the movie, that's okay. I loved it though.",10,3,4,2 April 2007
