Blade Runner 2049," uuuuaauuuuuu
","Superb!!! I'm a fan of original, but this one really makes a step forward. I never ever been at the movies where whole theater was so silent like nobody was breathing. And at the end I needed half an hour to process the movie and even start talking. Auuuauuuuu!! That never happened to me. Respect!!!",10,3,13,21 October 2017
Passengers," Loved it!
","I watched it now the third time and every time it's getting better and better. It has drama, it has space, it has SciFi and of course it has the love. All the needed ingredients to make you smile at the end of the movie.Put it all together it's a movie that will stay in the collection.P.S. If somebody wants to watch another good one watch 'A good year'.",9,0,0,25 April 2017
Spectre," Finally Bond returned
","I've been watching Bond movies from the start and simply loved the old ones from Sean and Roger. So I almost gave up that there will be any really good Bond movies again, but Craig really brought back the 'Bond' feelings I had as a child. First Casino Royal reopened the interest and I said to my self that there could be something here. The next two continued the roller coaster, but Spectre... BANGGG... it really hit me like the old ones. It drove me through ups and downs lefts and rights with lots of surprises. I felt like a child again with eyes wideee opened. Ah yes it was wonderful. Thanks for making this movie and please continue the great work.",10,2,8,10 April 2017
