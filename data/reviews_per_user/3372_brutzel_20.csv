The Lobster," Avoid. Very Disturbing
","David (Colin Farrell) checks in to the Hotel with his brother who has been changed into a dog. (Whaat??) He will have 45-days to get a partner and if he doesn't he will be turned into an animal of his choice. (Whaaat??) David decides he wants to be turned into a Lobster. (Whaat??) Oh, this Is not a surprise as he agrees to this. (Whaaat??) If he finds a mate and there are problems he will be given a child that will act as a buffer.Some may see the name Colin Farrell and decide to watch. In this case it's tsk, tsk, tsk. This is a warning of sorts. Avoid this. There are many disturbing images in here and dialogues that describe some very unspeakable things that could happen. It has been mentioned that Colin Farrell gained about 40-pounds for this role. Why I am not sure, but I thought the 40-pounds looked good on him. So if you didn't know that he gained 40-pounds, you probably will not recognize him. I didn't .Yes, this is a satire, but a very unconventional one. It mocks relationships and pretensions that we go thru to show normality for the most part. All dialogues are mono-toned and no emotions are shown regardless of what just happened. Oh, WAIT, John C. Riley as Robert the Lisping Man has his fingers put into a hot toaster as punishment for masturbating (he got caught) as that is not allowed. He does scream and shows emotions. Sexual stimulation is allowed but only given by a maid in a sort of lap dance way. There is another group of people who live in the woods and are called 'Loners.' And these Loners are hunted and tranquilized by the people from the Hotel. It is against the law to flirt or have relationships among these Loners. David escapes to these people and finds the Short Sighted Woman (Rachel Weisz) and they fall for each other and have to be careful not to draw attention to themselves. The Loner Leader (Lea Seydoux) discovers that the Short-Sighted woman becomes close to David and encourages her to have her eyes fixed, but this operation intentionally leaves the Short Sighted Woman blind. One of the last scenes shows David and the now blind woman in a restaurant. David orders a steak knife and goes into the bathroom to blind himself. We don't know if he goes through with it as the movie ends. Is it possible he didn't go thru with it and returned to the Hotel to become a Lobster? (Who cares?) I have mentioned many things that perhaps, I shouldn't have, but you need to know that his is not an entertaining movie. It is deeply disturbing and you have only been given a small sampling of some disturbing images and dialogues. Yes, there are many more. (Whaaat?) Remember: this is a satire and mocks relationships.Here's the thing. I saw that Colin Farrell was in this and decided to watch. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk.What this movie is trying to accomplish is beyond me. (Agreed) (1/10) Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, regular and that lap dance way. Nudity: Yes. Disturbing Images: Yes. Language: Yes.",1,31,49,5 August 2016
The Finest Hours," One of the greatest rescue movies of all time
","This is based upon a true story.In 1952 a severe storm off the coast of Cape Cod causes the oil tanker, SS Pendleton, to break in half sending 34 men to the stern of the ship in the hope of a rescue. Head Engineer, Ray Sybert (Casey Affeck) believes the only hope they have is to run the ship onto a shoal otherwise the ship would be at the mercy of the 70-foot waves. USCG Commander Cluff (Eric Bana) sends Bernie Webber (Chris Pine) and his team out to rescue the men on the Pendleton. The real danger in this is going through the bar, a series of shoals that are very dangerous to go thru even in calm weather. Oh, oh.This is probably one of the best rescue movies I have ever seen. I sat there cringing all the time even though I knew the rescue would be successful. How many of the scenes were shot is beyond me. Yes, I knew CGI played a big part in this butstill I mean it was like I was actually there being tossed about inside that half of a ship, and those waves outside were more than menacing. Kudos to the director.The acting all around is excellent, but the cinematography should win some awards as it was nothing short of spectacular. It looked like they shot the movie in the worst part of winter with ice all around and if that was CGI, it was exceptional. Kudos. (maybe movie magic?)Just like any trip we take, the longest part of the journey is getting there. Coming back doesn't take as long. And this was true within this movie. Took a long time to get to the half-ship, but coming back hardly took any time at all. See? (yes, very clever)There are no twists to look for, but keep in mind Bernie and company lost their compass and really didn't know where the Pendleton was. And after the rescue, Bernie didn't know where the homeland was to return. Bernie says on the way out he kept to the left and on the return he kept to the right. Seemed to have worked.Watch at the end to see what happened to all as photos are shown of the actual USCG crew.A statement at the end also says this was one of the greatest rescues in USCG history for small boats. I say this was probably the greatest rescue in history period. We salute the USCG, and, of course, all military personnel, firemen and policemen who run to the problem and not run away from it. Kudos and thank you. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",9,1,4,27 May 2016
Point Break," Watch for the Stunts in Real Time or via CGI
","Former Motocross rider John Utah (Luke Bracey) - now an FBI Agent - infiltrates a group of daredevils who perform heists with unbelievable success. Utah believes these extreme athletes are also performing the Ozaki 8: extreme feats to honor nature and some say that once completed the participants enter a state of Nirvana. You buy that?Now, let's get real. The only reason to watch this movie is to watch the stunts whether in real time or CGI because they are truly unbelievable and there are many of them. All this may be movie magic, but WOW! Hope you are not afraid of heights as we see many beautiful scenes in extremely high mountains, and of course we see all this from the tops of these mountains. Hope you are not one to get dizzy. What we see: Surfing with almost 80-foot waves, snowboarding down a mountain side, parachuting into a huge hole in the ground, outrunning a rock avalanche on a bike, flying down mountains in flying body suits, bike-riding on the edges of mountain-top ridges and a car chase on a very high and narrow mountain road. The story of the FBI going after these criminals gets lost in the stunts as we are relegated to philosophical discussions about honoring Nature via the Ozaki 8. A lot of the movie is somewhat preachy regarding honoring Nature. There is a shoot-out later on at a bank because the funds were cut off from these athletes and they need money to continue their 'heists.'The leader of these extreme athletes is Bodhi played by Edgar Ramirez and he does a credible job. He and his fellow daredevils are decked out in tattoos from head to toe as is Samsara (Teresa Palmer) the love interest for Utah and we can only hope those tats are washable. Yes, Utah also has a lot of tattoos as movies these days seem obsessed with them.Ray Winstone does a very good job as Pappas, an FBI Agent, who is tasked with keeping an eye on Utah as he works his way into the daredevil group. Delroy Lindo as FBI Instructor Hall I s also very good. You keep asking about a twist. Well, there is none, but the ending will have to suffice as it goes where you don't expect it to go. Or is it exactly right? Hmmmm (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",7,0,2,12 April 2016
Creed," Simply Terrific
","Adonis 'Donnie' Johnson (Jordan) the son of the late Apollo Creed, a former Heavyweight Champion of the World, asks Rocky Balboa (Stallone) to train him. Rocky reluctantly agrees. Later Adonis changes his name to Creed to fight Pretty Rickey Conlan (Tony Bellew) the British Light Heavyweight Champion of the World. Let the games begin. The Academy got it wrong. Sylvester Stallone should have been nominated for the Best Actor Award, not a Supporting Actor Award. He may not have beaten out Leo, but should have been in the same arena as Leo. You want a Best Supporting Actor? Look to Michael B. Jordan as Adonis 'Donnie' Creed, who was excellent throughout. Everything in this film is terrific, nothing dragged, was overdone or was drawn out. All the Rocky movies are terrific and so is this one. Many of us also enjoyed this for a small trip down Memory Lane and were not disappointed. All the final fight scenes in all the Rocky movies were spot on, brutal and some believe they were quite real and not a thing of movie magic. (Pretty sure they were all movie magic) All the supporting cast and technicians involved should be very proud of this movie. Notables: Liev Schreiber: Narrator for a while in the beginning; Phylicia Rashad as Mary Anne Creed, : the stepmother of Aldonis; Tessa Thompson as Bianca, the love interest of Adonis; Sports Announcers: Tony Kornheiser, Michael Wilbon, and Hannah Storm as themselves.All in all a terrific movie, thoroughly entertaining and one of the best boxing movies ever.

Youth," No plot so enjoy Michael Caine, Harvey Keitel and the Scenery of the Alps
","Old friends, music maestro Fred Ballinger (Michael Caine) and film director Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel), vacation at a luxury hotel in the Alps and just talk about life, death, old age, youth and their kids. Both are up there in age and reflect mostly on their youth and things they remember and things they cannot remember. Queen Elizabeth sends and emissary to Fred as the Queen wants Fred to perform something called Simple Songs as a birthday present for her husband, Prince Phillip. Fred says he is retired and won't do it. What you will see in here are numerous scenes that have nothing to do with the plot mostly because there is no plot. Now to be fair, we do enjoy the banter between Fred and Mick and we see that after all these years of friendship some secrets are revealed and with humor.Even though we are reminded of Seinfeld shows where everything is about nothing we see that Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel perform probably at their best ever. Yes, we keep waiting for something to happen but after a time we resign ourselves to believing nothing will happen and actually look forward to those meaningless scenes at the hotel. Some scenes we do remember: We see nudity in Saunas, and at the outdoor pool where Miss Universe (Madalina Diana Ghenea) bathes in the nude; a symphony of cows and noises in nature conducted by Fred; a Masseuse played by Luna Zimic Mijovic who prefers touching to talking; a child comes up to Fred and spouts that no one is up for being a parent or being an adult and we cannot prepare for either. But perhaps the most memorable scenes show a man and a woman eating but never talking to each other. Fred and Mick bet on if this couple will talk, and they never do, but then on a walk in the woods Fred and Mick see that couple going at it with the woman screaming in delight and we see Fred pay Mick. Then there are scenes as beautiful depictions of art, but we really cannot describe them as they go by too fast. We have the feeling the director puts these scenes in for his family and friends.Notables: Paul Dano as Jimmy Tree an actor who watches people at the hotel to prepare for an acting gig later on. Jane Fonda as Brenda an actress that Mick needs for his new movie. Rachael Weisz as Lena, Fred's daughter who is jilted by Mick's son.But everything reverts back to Youth. Fred says, ' I've grown so old without understanding how I got here.' The doctor asks, 'Do you know what awaits you after you leave here?' Fred says, 'No.' The Doctor replies, 'Youth.' Make of that what you will as we may center on memories of our youth even though we do not remember everything, but do remember certain bits very clearly. The most wonderful and astounding thing about this movie is the cinematography with picturesque Alps mountain scenes that we wish we could take with us for all time. I say this because there is no plot so enjoy the scenery, and the philosophies of life, death, old age, youth and loneliness. Ha!There is no plot, but this is still a comfortable viewing even though we don't understand all of it. And at the end we will hear what those Simple Songs sound like. (7/10)Violence: No. Sex: Yes, that couple in the woods. Nudity: Yes abounds a lot, but nothing erotic. Language: Yes, mostly in the beginning then it leaves us.",7,0,1,13 June 2016
The Hateful Eight," A Western or sorts, too long, talky, but still good
","In the dead of winter with a snow blizzard coming up fast, Bounty Hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell) takes Daisy (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to Red Rock for hanging. On the road, the stage coach meets up with another Bounty Hunter, Major Warren (Jackson) and Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) who claims to be the new Sheriff in Red Rock. Of course, no one trusts anyone. They stop for shelter at Minnie's store where we see other characters of ill-repute. Why are they there? This can't be good.We just know all this will result in terrific shootings. Kind of reminded me of the Smoking Aces movie where there was a shootout within an elevator. So I bided my time. The problem here is that it takes too long to get to that point. John Ruth takes guns away from everyone (except from the Major) to insure his and Daisy's safety. In the meantime we get to hear everyone's story and this is where talky, talky, talky comes into play. All this could have been shortened without losing any of the story. I see you are looking for the twist. Well, here's the thing: about Chapter 4 or so we come to see what happened before the stage coach with John Ruth and company arrived at Minnie's store. Now the real story begins. Notables: Michael Mardsen as Joe Gage who says he is going home to see his mother; Tim Roth as Oswaldo Mobray, the Hangman going to Red Rock; Bruce Dern as Confederate General Sandy Smithers going to Red Rock to see the grave of his son killed in the Civil War; James Parks as O.B . the stage coach driver; and Demian Bichir as Bob, the Mexican who tells everyone he is just minding the store for Minnie who left for a while. Channing Tatum as Jody: comes in really late. Can't say more.This can be considered a classic WESTERN WHO-DUN-IT and we follow Major Warren's logic and see that he makes a lot of sense. I know in the past I have always accused Samuel L. Jackson - many times – of playing a character who likes to pontificate. So true in here as well. But truth be told, he is extremely good at it. Kudos. You almost expect him to ask you 'what's in your wallet?' from an ad he's in. Ha! The telling of the General's son who performed fellatio on the Major was quite unnecessary.The shootings are what we come to this movie to see. Hey, this is a Quinton Tarantino movie! Ever see a watermelon blown away by a shotgun? That is what you will see when shots are fired at the heads of some characters. The CGI is unforgiving and there will be blood everywhere. The cinematography is so good that you wished you could take a picture of some scenery, put a frame in it and hang it on a wall. Although this is quite talky for most of the movie, the acting and dialogues are spot on and quite engaging. It's just that too many characters have too much to say. Ha! (7/10)Violence: Yes.

Southpaw," Not bad
","Billy Hope (Gyllenhaal) is the Light Heavyweight Champion of the World. In a bizarre accident his wife Maureen (McAdams) is killed. He has another fight and cannot concentrate and loses. Then he is told by financial advisers that he is out of money. All now is lost: his house, cars etc and also his daughter, 8-year old Leila (Oona Laurance), now must go into Family Protection Services. He is devastated but goes on a path of self-destruction. . He must find a way to get back to doing what he loves and get his daughter back. He meets Tick Willis (Whitaker) who reluctantly agrees to train him. Just what we need: another fight movie that we know is going to be very sad. And that is just what we have now and I was prepared not to like this movie. However, the pull for me turned out to be the relationship between Billy and daughter Leila. Yes, we see Billy train hard to get back and he does a good job of that, but the strained relationship with Leila tugs at our heart strings. To be fair Gyllenhaal as Billy has fully invested himself in here with both the training and getting his daughter back. Some say an Oscar is in his future. The fight scenes are brutal and looked more than real, but the visits to Family Services to get estranged Leila back is uppermost in his mind. Ours too. If you watch keep a box of Kleenex handy. There will be moments(what's wrong, you now seem to like the movie?) Here's the thing: Billy's wife was his manager and she would not have let their finances get so low. This part of the movie when he is told he is broke came too quickly in a very short period of time as the movie just opened. Just seemed too contrived. When Tick Willis comes on the scene I thought maybe that he would convince Billy to sue his financial advisors for stealing from him, but that didn't happen. Instead Tick just trained Billy and actually taught him how to box and not act like a street thug in the ring. Tick convinces Billy to hit southpaw, but this looked awkward with Billy hunching up his left shoulder to protect his left side and eye. Billy didn't look like a left hander in the ring. There didn't seem to be any room for Billy to land a knockout punch with his left hand. Like I said: awkward. Actually, the title should have been Redemption or Hope's Redemption. One more thing. When a character like Tick, the Trainer, wants to give hushed advice to his boxer, the Director should remember there is an audience that needs to hear this advice. Often Tick's whispers couldn't be understood. So .. not bad, but the relationship with the daughter was the pull for me, the fights were okay and brutal. This is not the blockbuster some have made it out to be. And don't forget, we need to get past CREED. Ha! (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes.",7,1,2,1 January 2016
The Revenant," Outstanding
","Webster defines revenant as someone who comes back after death. (So reincarnation is real?) In 1823, frontiersman Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) is left for dead after a vicious attack by a bear that was only protecting her cubs. Glass somehow survives and must find John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), who killed his son and who abandoned him.I had reservations about watching this movie as I knew I will follow Hugh Glass, who will endure much pain for a very long time. Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Yes, Leo DiCaprio was awarded the Oscar for Best Actor. However, if truth be known, Leo DiCaprio should have won that award for Blood Diamond, or The Great Gatsby and possibly many more. He is that good. When a performer raises the talent level of all those around him, and does that often, he or she deserves the Oscar. Think about that, Academy. This cast performed beyond all expectations. And let's give some kudos to Director Alejandro G. Inarritu who put all this together and won the award for Best Director. Kudos.Most of the movie is Glass' determination to survive the elements, Indians, and his own weakened health. One wonders how some of those scenes were done as they are simply breathtaking. Watch a horse and rider (Glass) go over a cliff into a tree. Wow! Glass swimming against a strong current. Hey, and let's not forget about the cameramen and the work they did. Outstanding. Aside from all the survival tactics employed by Glass to survive, the plot is a simple one: Get healthy and find and kill Fitzgerald. Subtitles were used generously mostly in the beginning and let's face it: they were not necessary. Also the Fitzgerald character (Hardy) was practically the only one to use F-bombs a lot when he didn't agree with the decision, by Glass, to abandon the river boat, hide the furs and walk back to the fort. As I watched, I had the feeling that that here was DiCaprio winning the Best Actor Award. And it was sometimes hard to actually realize that Hugh Glass was a real person who lived through all this, and it was probably much worse than depicted as we saw on the screen by DiCaprio.So when all was said and done and Oscars were awarded for Best Director, Best Actor, best Supporting Actor (Hardy), something was missing: The film did not get the award for Best Picture. Sad. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, mostly in the beginning.",9,3,6,27 April 2016
Bridge of Spies," Well Told
","In the late 1950s insurance lawyer James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is tasked by the CIA with defending Russian spy Rudolph Abel (Mark Rylance) in a U.S. court of law. Later Donovan is tasked with negotiating the swap of Abel for downed U.S. U2 (spy plane) pilot Gary Powers (Austin Stowell). Then Donovan learns of an American Economics student, Frederick Pryor (Will Rogers) held by the Russians and wants to do a 2-for-1 deal that the CIA is against. The CIA just wants Powers. Here we go.The only action scenes show the U2 spy plane being hit by Russian missiles and Gary Powers trying to reach the plane's self destruct button. These scenes are extremely good. Other than those brief action scenes, this is a talk-fest, but the conversations don't drag and are very concise among the Russians, the East Germans (this was the time the Berlin Wall went up), the CIA, some other U.S. government officials and James Donovan.The most engaging scenes are between Rudolph Abel and Donovan and they are excellent as the dialogues were spot on. When Donovan asks Abel why he doesn't show that he is worried Abel replies, ' Would it help?' It wouldn't surprise me if Mark Rylance as Abel is nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Award. He is really good. This was history being made and this story is well told. There is nothing complicated and you always know what is going on. However, I was not aware that Donovan also wanted to get Pryor out of Russia as part of the deal. Tom Hanks as James Donovan in this role is perfect. As always.Unlike most spy stories, there really is no tension in here, but there is some suspense later on when the spy swap is supposed to take place at the Glienicke Bridge and at Checkpoint Charlie. Oh, oh.Notables: Alan Alda, Jesse PlemonsAll in all, well told and now you know the rest of the story. Stay tuned to the ending when the credits run to find out what happened to everyone.

Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," It's Okay, but.....
","The IMF (Impossible Mission Force) is shut down as reckless, dangerous and has no proof that a shadow organization called the Syndicate exists to destroy the IMF. Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is now on the run from the C.I.A.'s Hunley (Alec Baldwin) as he is blamed for assassinating a foreign minister. Hunt must gather his team to prove the Syndicate exists and to clear his name. The only reason to watch this movie is to enjoy the special effects, CGI (and they are spectacular) and Tom Cruise who still is touted as doing his own stunts. And all of this is good, but this Mission Impossible movie is not as good as previous ones. It is simply stunt after stunt after stunt and so on. There appears to be a rush to get to these stunts seemingly to avoid real dialogues and getting to know the players. However, there is a bright spot in here and that is Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa, a MI6 agent who is undercover in the Syndicate's organization run by Lane (Sean Harris) to bring it down. She is pretty, can act and she can fight which is a new wrinkle in Mission Impossible movies. Notables: Jeremy Renner as Brandt, Simon Pegg as Benji, and Ving Rhames as Luther who are all part of Hunt's IMF teamMaybe what I am looking for is more of a story in the vein of a LeCarre novel with the CGI and Tom Cruise stunts. Hey, it could work. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No. Rating: B",7,2,3,18 December 2015
Pawn Sacrifice," Quite Engaging
","This is based upon a true story. Chess Prodigy Bobby Fischer (Toby Mcguire) becomes a household name during the Cold War years as he believes he is the best chess player in the world and his goal is to beat the Russian champion Boris Spassky (Liev Schreiber). He is somewhat paranoid believing he is being spied on by both governments: Russia and the United States. When a movie comes out and claims to be a true story we really don't know all the facts. Such is the case here. Let's say we get a smattering of the truth and this is contrasted between what we knew from the newspapers and TV broadcasts had we lived during those 1970s Cold War years . And if not, there is always Wikipedia to fill in some blanks. A chess match between Fischer and Spassky was considered to be the Super Bowl of chess. The whole world was interested. What intrigues us mostly are the rules or boundaries that Fischer demands before he sits with Spassky. Will he get away with his demands? Will he show up if his demands are not met? How does Spassky feel about these distractions? We see Fischer beat many worthy opponents, but the goal is always Spassky. What we are drawn to are facial expressions of everyone in the movie, but in particular: Fischer and we cannot look away. These facial expressions are the pull in this story. That and his rebellion against almost everything and it is what keeps us engaged. Is he genius or just mad? You decide. Fischer's behavior can be traced back to childhood when his anti-war mother probably instilled in him that no one can be trusted. (you're just saying, right?)Looking for bugs we often see Fischer rip up just about everything in his rooms and one would think that someone would ask him, 'how many bugs have you found?' Never happened. (that we know of)As we go along we see 2-friends try to help Fischer to be more reasonable. We see lawyer Paul Marshall (Michael Stuhlbarg) and Father Bill Lombardy (Peter Sarsgaard) fail at almost every attempt. Nothing they do gets through to Bobby Fischer.In 2011 there was a documentary: Bobby Fischer Against the World and that should have been the title for this movie or something akin as the one we have now is too passive. Fischer's struggles were against the world as this movie shows. See?Soooo who won the big match between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky? I believe it's your move.

Everest," Intense, Riveting and Quite Engaging
","This is based upon a true storyRob Hall (Jason Clarke) started the concept of guiding amateurs to the top of Mt Everest. His idea spawned other enterprises. In 1996, many such teams contemplated the climb and they have a 2-week window in which to do it. The start date is 10 May 1996. Hall and another company run by Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhall) agree to team up to lessen the congestion. All seems good until a vicious storm comes around and later comes around again. Oh, oh This movie was actually shot on Mt Everest. Of course we expected to see CGI play a very big roll in this and it was spectacular to say the least. Some of the photography is overwhelming and sometimes scary too. We learn that Sherpas are the ones who set the ropes up the mountain for the climbers to hold onto. They also install ladders over crevices. Also the Sherpas are the ones who preposition oxygen tanks at designated locations up the mountain.I didn't know there were that many base camps at varying elevations. Communications back to the states was set up via a satellite link. All members of all the teams had Walkie-Talkies. I was surprised to see that many partook in alcohol waiting to go up. I would have thought booze was a no-no. Guess not.Everyone has a reason to climb Mt Everest. It isn't just because 'it's there.' Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) needs to show his kids they can achieve anything in life. Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) needs to prove to himself that he can do it as he failed to climb Mt Mckinley to the top. How much does it cost someone to join Rob Hall's company for the climb? At one point Beck mentions that he paid $65,000. Is this true? I have no idea. When the storms hit, the intensity multiplies and with the winds whipping all over the audio suffered as sometimes it was difficult to hear what the characters were saying. Talk about realism. Ha! It was like we were there. Notables: Robin Wright as Peaches the wife of Beck Weathers. Keira Knightley as Jan, the wife of Rob Hall. Sam Worthington as Guy Cotter. Emily Watson as Helen the main communicator with Rob's team.The acting all around was sensational. Jason Clarke as Rob Hall is really coming into his own regardless of any role he plays. Kudos. This movie will keep you engaged and you do hope all ends well. At the end of the movie you will learn what happened to everyone. (10/10)Violence: Yes.

Sicario," Well Told
","FBI Agent, Kate (Emily Blunt) is asked to join a team to catch Mexican cartel leader Manuel Diaz so that he would lead them to the big cartel boss: Fausto Alarcon. She only agrees to join the team because she wants to find the people who just killed some of her team. Even though she agrees to join the team she is kept in the dark about the team's ultimate mission and who is this mysterious Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro)? (do you think he looks a little like Brad Pitt?)In the beginning of the movie we are told that Sicario means Hit-man. Although we are not sure, we do suspect that Alejandro is the Hit-man. (makes sense to me) As we go along we see Kate is always in the dark about what is going on. The leader of this team is Matt (Josh Brolin) who doesn't do things by the book and this disturbs Kate. Later we learn why Kate was allowed to join this team.For the longest time, the most striking thing I noticed was the haunting music that often sounded like a run-a-way train or a hurricane coming in and gave the impression of impending doom, but it was rhythmical and well done. Kudos. I suppose the only thing we can come away with is that things are not done by book to keep drugs out of the U.S. Be prepared for some disturbing images and brutality. But then there is the reason Alejandro is on the team. What could it be?Notables: Victor Garber and Jeffrey Donovan. This is a well told story. The acting and dialogues are spot on.

"Hail, Caesar!"," Cameo-fest. Not Entertaining
","In the 1950s Capital Pictures is making a movie about Jesus Christ called 'Hail Caesar' starring Baird Whitlock (George Clooney). Long story short, he gets kidnapped and Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin), production executive, runs around trying to solve movie production problems with the stars and learns about the ransom demand for the return of Whitlock.The most exciting and entertaining scene in here is with Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehreneich) a cowboy movie star. While waiting for a starlit to take to his cowboy movie premier we see him practice with his rope and boy is he good. We could have watched him for a longer time, but The rest of the movie is not as entertaining or interesting. Eddie Mannix solves problems on the run and do we care? No. Eddie is offered a big job with an aircraft company and he has a decision to make. Do we care? Not at all.Nothing is funny or even clever. Who wrote this? We do see different movie scenes as they rehearse for the real thing when the cameras do roll later on. Do we care? No. The Sailor dance sequence was okay, but was too long in this non-plot movie. The kidnapping leaves Whitlock with impressions that the movie capitalist system keeps the little guy down and he's on board with that. He likes what he hears This and the kidnapping itself takes care of the main plot, if it was a plot at all. But to be fair we are very impressed with Clooney's Whitlock when he talks about the Christ on the Cross in front of the Cross. Very moving and could have been used in a legitimate Jesus Christ story. Very moving.Notables that really don't add much to the movie and why they are there is a mystery because there wasn't much of a plot to get excited about: Ralph Fiennes, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Channing Tatum, Frances McDormand, Jonah Hill, Robert Picardo, David Krumholtz. After watching this I have to ask myself why was this movie made as it was not entertaining, had no real plot, had no funny or even clever lines. It was more like a cameo-fest with no purpose. To put it frankly we didn't care about anything in this movie. Yes, the acting was good all around, but nothing went anywhere and oh, we just didn't care. See?

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Needed to be told and it was extremely well told
","Because of the collateral damage caused by Superman's (Henry Cavill) battle with General Zod (Michael Shannon) in the previous movie Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck) is on a mission to kill Superman as he is convinced Superman has no remorse for his actions and is completely dangerous to civilization. Yes, the movie is too long. Yes, it contains mostly darkened scenes. Yes, the CGI is absolutely fantastic. Yes, the action scenes outnumber scenes where people talk to each other. Yes, Alfred (Jeremy Irons) acts too snippy for a trusted employee to Bruce Wayne. (would have preferred Morgan Freeman) Yes, we really don't see/hear Superman's explanation when he is called before a Congressional Committee. Yes, Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) acts too much out of control (would have preferred Michael Rosenbaum in this role). Yes, we don't really believe what happened at the end (sorry, can't tell you about this). Yes, yes, yes and yes, but, I loved every minute of it. The story was unlike any other and was completely solid and extremely well told. An Academy Award for Screenplay? Hmmmpossible. And let's look at Ben and Henry for their roles for Best Actor or Best Supporting Actor. They were simply fantastic. Kudos. Yes, I wanted Superman and Batman to become friends like Jack and Arnie, but this story needed to be told even though we did have reservations about it. We needed Batman to get over himself.Did we really believe that Batman could actually kill Superman? Yes, when Kryptonite is used and it was used most effectively in here. Did we want it to happen? Of course not. The scenes with Doomsday were really too long and over the top and could have been cut to a shorter length. I wanted Doomsday to be whacked quickly, but the CGI technician just couldn't let it go and these scenes rambled on and on and on. (Good grief! as Charlie Brown would say)This was filmed in Mexico and the numbers in the cast did rival 'a cast of thousands' as we used to hear from time to time. Everyone involved was credited. Notables: Amy Adams as Lois Lane; Diane Lane as Martha , Clark's mother; Holly Hunter as Senator Finch; Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman and a breath of fresh air; Laurence Fishburne as Perry White;. No , there was no Jimmy Olsen character. There were many well known TV journalists as themselves. So what did I take away from this movie? Now, I cannot wait for the next one mostly because of how this one ended. Still cannot tell you, but I did see some movement in the very last scene. No still can't say. (10/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No Language: Only one 'S' word was heard",10,1,4,24 July 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Not Much New Here
","The story is a rehash of all the episodes that went before with some exception: the Bad Guys are now called The First Order led by the Supreme Leader Snoke played by Andy Serkis. The main premise centers on finding Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) so that he cannot lead a rebellion against the First Order. Luke had gone into seclusion.The only reason to watch this movie is to enjoy the CGI which is again spectacular. Nothing is really new except for the young scavenger girl Rey played by Daisy Ridley and she is pretty and a breath of fresh air in a series that truly needs it. Of course, the First Order has a weapon that uses the power of the sun to destroy the Republic led by General/Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). The main fallacy here is that had the First Order used the weapon and destroyed the Republic and didn't concentrate on finding Luke, well, that would have been that and end of story. But they didn't and well, you know the good guys -- ( Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) -- will find a way to destroy the First Order. Hey, it's in the script. (You waited on that one, eh?)There are some almost good lines between Han Solo and Chewbacca and sometimes Rey. Han Solo does comment on Princess Leia's hair (he likes it this way) that was atrocious in previous Star Wars movies. We learn that the General under Supreme Leader Snoke is Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) who happens to be the son of Han Solo and Princess Leia. Who knew? (I believe you fell asleep in previous stories) Yes, that is true, the never ending battles and explosions all over the galaxy have that tendency to put me into la la land. This time the battles didn't last as long and that was a good thing.Something that was disappointing was the voice of General Kylo Ren. We expected it to be more along the lines of Darth Vader back in the day. But he sounded more like a Brooklynite who happened to be in charge of Storm Troopers in the First Order. (yes, we expected something more commanding along Darth Vader's voice especially with the Mask on.) One other thing that may or may not be true, but sometimes I had the feeling that some conversations were dubbed. Could have been just me, butIf one had never seen previous Star Wars movies this movie will be excellent and quite enjoyable, but for others we saw a rehash of previous versions, nothing really new and it's just the same with the good guys going after the bad guys that included spectacular CGI to include outstanding cinematography.

Deadpool," Disappointing
","Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) has cancer and undergoes a procedure by Ajax (Ed Skrein) to cure him of the cancer, and it gives him super powers. The idea was to make Wilson a superhero who can be auctioned off to the highest bidder for other mercenary work, but he escapes from Ajax. The main problem is that his face changed to something hideous and he is afraid to confront girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). He now calls himself Deadpool, and he needs to find Ajax who he believes can reverse the procedure and make him normal looking again. What was good: the action scenes with generous compliments of CGI is spectacular and very creative. Kudos. The acting was good when dialogues weren't being too silly.What was bad: Silly childish dialogues mostly from Deadpool, toilet humor, F-bombs and other disgusting sexual language. To be fair, sometimes Deadpool's humor was spot on. I said 'sometimes.'Deadpool gets X-Men Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) to help him defeat Ajax.Notable: Leslie Uggums as Blind Al.The movie would have been better if much of the bad stuff above was toned back a lot. The way this was presented was too over the top and bordered on being most annoying and childish, at times.This movie has taught me to be wary of Marvel comics presentations to the big screen. They just go too far with language and toilet humor and now we can add silly dialogues. This was disappointing. (3/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, one time in the beginning. Nudity: Yes at a girlie bar. Language: Yes. Rating: D",3,10,22,10 July 2016
Spectre," Very Good
","Bond, James Bond (Daniel Craig) needs to locate and destroy Spectre run by Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) whose organization links all the intelligence agencies of the whole world so he can control all information worldwide. M (Ralph Finnes) grounds Bond, James Bond for going rogue to Mexico. Bond, James Bond learns that the double O program is to be disbanded. M is not pleased about this. MI5 and MI6 are to be consolidated with MI5 boss C (Andrew Scott) running the program called Nine Eyes which also links all worldwide intelligence agencies under MI5. Can you see a connection here? Oh, one more thing: Bond, James Bond discovers he may have a step brother. Guess who. (Whaaaat?)The stunts including the fights whether real or CGI are still spectacular, the acting all around is good and the movie locations are visually pleasing. The car chase and the plane chasing the bad guys were exciting to say the least. Totally. The music is not all the James Bond Theme and was pretty good especially near the end when Bond, James Bond does his thing to end all the bad stuff. It was heart-stopping. Kudos. Christoph Waltz is terrific as Blofeld, but was not a menacing bad guy. We almost liked him, but his screen time was not all that much. When Waltz is on screen you cannot take your eyes off him. He is that good. We miss the Bond, James Bond quips we got used to when Sean, and Roger,et al were Bond, James Bond. Okay, there was only one good one. Bond, James Bond believes he needs to show Madeleine (Lea Seydoux) how to protect herself by giving her a pistol. She keeps saying she doesn't like guns, but proceeds to eject the magazine and the bullet in the chamber. Bond, James Bond is impressed and says he will skip the hand-to-hand combat aspect. We need the quips to return. When the quips return, the swagger returns. See?Lea Seydoux as Madeleine is extremely beautiful and can act (You falling in love again?) and as a Bond, James Bond Girl she is right up there with the best of them. (Yeah, you're done)We also miss all the gadgets the old Q used to give Bond, James Bond. Here the new Q (Ben Whishaw) gives Bond, James Bond a watch. (A whaaaaat?)All in all this is very good, the pacing is up to par, the stunts and music work well and we are pleased but feel this is a setup for the next movie because guess who is left alive? See? (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No. Rating: A",9,4,8,10 February 2016
The Nice Guys," Too long, not funny, and sometimes hard to follow
","In 1977, a self proclaimed 'fixer' Mr Healy (Russell Crowe) and a private detective Mr. March (Ryan Gosling) team up to locate Amelia (Margaret Qualley) who may hold the key to all the murders and what the Hippie demonstrations are really all about. They are helped, at times, by March's teenage daughter Holly (Angourie Rice). One thing becomes absolutely clear: Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling should never do comedy or not do comedy with a lame script such as this. Their banter doesn't go anywhere, there are no good lines, nothing is funny and the sight gags fail too. Aside from all that the acting is okay, but what's the point when everything else fails? We couldn't wait for this to be over. Another thing and this is disheartening is when we have children mouthing F-bombs as we see Holly do. What are we coming to? Huh?This movie gets dragged out overly long with aimless running around forÂ…Â…..oh, for clues and a big shoot'em up near the end with a couple fight scenes that could have used Jackie Chan's choreographers. Notable: Kim Bassinger, Amelia's mother, who is also in charge of the Department of Justice. A monstrously forgettable movie and our hope is that Crowe and Gosling go back to drama where they belong and where we also hear some good lines from time to time. (3/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: Yes, but very brief in an under water show. Language: Yes, but not all that much.",3,7,14,27 September 2016
The Martian," Good Story. Fantastic Visuals
","Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead on Mars when a deadly surprise storm comes upon the crew and they are forced to leave without Watney. However, Watney does survive the storm and must find a way to subsist and contact NASA. For some unknown reason this is billed as a comedy. This is not a comedy. There are some good lines spouted by the characters but they do not a comedy make. See? This is a drama.This is okay, a little long perhaps, but the rescue mission near the end is loaded with hopeful anticipation and tension. The visuals including the Mars landscape and inside the ships throughout are spectacular. The cinematography and photography are truly fantastic. Since Mark Watney is a Botonist he is able to feed himself by growing potatoes and he finds a way to communicate with NASA to let the world know he is alive. Everything Watney does is recorded by him for posterity. And it's also a way to keep himself occupied without going mad. His dialogues are concise and logical. The pacing is very good. We don't see Whatney having many 'down moments.' There is always hope and work to be done to survive. Matt Damon as Watney does a very good job in this survival mode and we don't get bored watching him Gerry-rig many things and sometimes making humorous comments. Kudos.Back on Earth there are plans to rescue Watney. They talk of a future Mars mission that will land the ship 3200 Kilometers away from where he currently is. This part didn't make sense to me. Why not have this Mars mission recalculated to land where he is and not so far away? Huh? Why make Watney make a 3200 kilometer trip when something bad can happen on this planet? Remember the storm that caused all this in the first place? And - by the way - we never see a storm like that again after all the time Watney spends on the planet. Was that one storm an anomaly? A one-time thing? Huh? (it's only a movie, Bob)Also, the Chinese say they will help with supplies using their new secret super rocket to give the supplies to the Hermes, the rescue ship. However, we never see this exchange between the Chinese ship and the Hermes. The cutting room floor did thisor maybe it was a given and we didn't need to see it. (ya think?)Dialogues back on Earth debating how to do the rescue are good, real and made sense. Notables: Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Kate Mara, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Jeff Daniels and they all did credible jobs. Yes, this is somewhat long, but It's the fantastic visuals, Watney's survival work and dialogues and the rescue mission near the end will keep you engaged. (7/10)Violence: No. (well, the storm). Sex: No. Nudity: Yes, a male backside briefly. Language: Yes, not spoken but written on computer screens and not much of it.",7,2,3,14 January 2016
