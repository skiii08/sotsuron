Requiem for a Dream," The equivalent of paying someone to kick you in the teeth...in a good way.
","I had the fortune of seeing this in the theatres and felt absolutely terrible as I left theatre, both physically and emotionally drained. Having since purchased the DVD, it is the one I watch the least, although it is still one of the most important films in my collection, if not for its message, but in the way the message is conveyed.The transformation of each characters is heartbreaking to behold. Starting off with MTV-esquire reckless abandon, the characters quickly go into a year-long tailspin in which there is no hope for redemption.The cast makes this one work. Despite their weaknesses, they are all people that you can relate to. Best friends, lovers, mothers, sons. Ellen Burstyn gets a lot of praise for her work, but all major players (Shawn Wayans, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly) all deserve praise for taking on such material and the way they do it.On a technical note, the film is brilliant. Editing that would normally be headache inducing under any other director works for this film.Although you cannot watch, you cannot look away.",10,1,2,10 February 2005
Spider-Man 2," Wow! Meets and exceeds all expectations!
","There is more of everything in this film, and while more is not necessarily better, they do MAKE it better. The dramatic moments are more touching, action more pulse-pounding, the visual effects are more realistic, and comedy much more funny (Spider-Man's conversation with the guy in the elevator will have you howling). Characters are all spot-on, performances are solid, and the neat little nods and references here and there (the Asian woman with a violin singing the classic Spidey theme off key is grating, yet somehow fitting) give a little something extra for the comic book nerds to appreciate.My only complaint: Spider-Man 3 is likely going to be lackluster in comparison. They've REALLY outdone themselves!",10,0,0,30 June 2004
The Fast and the Furious," Car Porn
","The title says it all.  With more than enough high-performance cars to salivate over, high-testosterone machismo, and more high-adrenaline action and speed than a dozen 'Gone In Sixty Seconds', we have a winner. Admittedly thin on important things like plot, good dialogue, and character development, the film is fun ride and doesn't try to be any more than that. For that reason the film succeeds.This film works best as a guilty pleasure and should be appreciated as such. It's not high art, but it certainly does raise the bar for car chase sequences and the like.",Null,0,1,18 June 2002
Spirited Away," Excellent! Nightmarishly surreal yet charming at the same time.
","This is a film that deserves a much wider release than it is currently getting.  Taking a cue from Alice in Wonderland and Wizard of Oz, Hayao Miyazaki takes the fairy tale conventions and gives us one of his finest works yet, beating the pants off everything he has done before.In a world where Japanese animation gets a bit of a bad rap for its adult-content (despite the fact that it's no worse than North American mainstream cinema), comes a film that both adults and children can enjoy. It's best that you walk in with no expectations as I did.",10,2,3,16 October 2002
22 Jump Street," True Bromance
","You don't step into a movie like this expecting something profound and deep, and surely enough, this is anything but. Packed with some offensive humour, foul language, and inappropriate sexual innuendos, this makes for a very entertaining night at the movies.The film is at its best when it makes fun of itself (referencing the fact that you're watching a sequel with a much bigger budget, also poking fun at the fact that Hill and Tatum are way too old to play college kids, plus tossing in a few in-jokes to see how closely you're paying attention), and just as good with the wacky antics of the characters.Watch out for some surprising cameos and stick around for the ending credits.",8,4,11,15 June 2014
Men in Black II," Pointless
","All of the good jokes are blown in the trailer and the whole film is nothing more than a rehash of the original, which also had all of the good jokes blown in the trailer.The worst part was that the filmmakers essentially slapped the film together with knowledge that with an aggressive marketing campaign, people would show up to see the movie in droves.  People showed up to see the movie in droves, and it shamefully became one of the biggest grossers of the summer.",Null,0,0,5 October 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Wow!
","The mainstream audience that likes the film will say that Tarantino is a genius and the saviour of cinema, as he shows us something that has never been seen before and makes it entertaining.The cynical audience that hates the film will say that he is a hack.  Didja see Reservoir Dogs?  That was so ripped off from Ringo Lam's City on Fire. There is nothing original in his films at all.I say, who really cares?  Kill Bill vol. 1 is thoroughly entertaining, filled with tons of action, blood, guts, and humour.  Fans of Battle Royale will especially appreciate the appearance of Churiaki Kuriyama, who plays a very deadly assassin that uses exotic weaponry.  Bring on Volume 2!",Null,0,1,11 October 2003
X2: X-Men United," Very strong sequel, much better than the first!
","With so much kick-ass action and visuals, and even a plot to boot, this is definitely the highlight of the summer of 2003.  Standout moments are the raid on the X-Mansion and the attack on the White House.I can't think of a weak moment in the film, as it is strong from start to finish.  The tongue in cheek humour is great (Iceman cooling off Wolverine's beverage, some great dialogue moments, the like), while the visual effects are incredible.Easily fulfills all expectations.  Can't wait for the DVD.  Bring on X3!",9,0,0,28 August 2003
Sin City," Vicious in delivery, brilliant in execution. A great comic book flick.
","Just got back from this one. Easily one of the most faithful adaptations of the medium, right down to Frank Miller's visual style. Having picked up the odd Sin City comic here and there, everything's intact. And I'm not even a Frank Miller fan (outside of his work on Daredevil).Great performances all around, especially from Mickey Rourke, who does a great turn as Marv (although the prosthetics make him look a bit like Hellboy). Benicio Del Toro, Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, et al are great as well.Clearly, Robert Rodriguez 'gets' it. Now, all I gotta do is break open the ole piggy bank, head to the comic book store, and pick up 'That Yellow Bastard', 'A Dame to Kill For', 'The Big Fat Kill' and 'Sin City'.",Null,1,4,2 April 2005
Shark Tale," Weak.
","Whereas Pixar's animated flicks are built around a solid script with well-developed characters and some pop culture references added in, Shark Tale is built around stereotypes and dated pop culture references. It feels like this script was written at least ten years ago.While the preview audience I was in was fairly entertained (there were a lot of kids in the audience), I found it to be fairly pedestrian and weak. I quickly lost interest long before Oscar starts rapping to MC Hammer and starts spouting over-used one-liners from much better movies ('You can't handle the truth!' 'You had me at hello!').Your entertainment dollar would be spent watching something else.",Null,1,3,27 September 2004
