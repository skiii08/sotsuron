The Hangover," A complete entertainer
",Initially I have a reason why i started to watch this movie.....that is because of its transperancy in their dialogues and language and their complete absurd behaviour in the middle of the city which i saw it in a sneakpick scenes in youtube........and ofcourse it has alot of 18+ contents in its scenes.......we should be aware before start watch the flim infront of the children .......but i can assure you that its a complete entertainer for real.........its a must watch movie for the youngsters........for the first 30 mins you will have no Idea whats that actually happening ..... movies title itself say hangover....but it kind of looked like a normal commercial stuffed movie....but there is where the bang begans with the complete delusion.....and rest of the things next gonna happen shows what is if somebody gets handover the day before their friends wedding ceremony......its a complete blockbuster.....i recommend every one above 18+ should watch it atleast once in their life,8,0,0,15 May 2020
Oblivion," Delusional in its way
","Yes it was just like a delusion for me while watching the movie........first i thought it was gonna be like an ordinary invasion movie by the aliens as an aftermath of the victory against the invaders.........but after an hour of watching it,just i came to know that there are alot of mystery laying behind till untold at that point, hey ...this is the place where it made me curious to watch the flim without getting bored, one might feel lot of confusion in the story.....i am saying this not for the hero(tom cruise)alone and rather the audience who watches it......but some how the flim make team managed to conclude in some way with an compromising good ending......hey its good to see for once, but sorry to say that, this movie is not really an entertainer......at some point you may feel you have to watch the rest of the movie just to know the ending.",8,0,0,15 May 2020
