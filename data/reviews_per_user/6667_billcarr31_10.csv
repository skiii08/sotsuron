Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Very disappointing.
","Well not really as I was not as impressed as many seem to have been by the first one. What a shame that a movie with such good productions values and sets, although most of them are only seen for seconds, is so over burdened with pointless dramatics. Notions like putting a platoon of redcoats on a train with a machine gun to kill a man and his wife are too ludicrous for words. A pistol or a small bomb would have done a better job. Of course Holmes dispatches the whole platoon with ease, even somehow making a time bomb from a brass a tap and a toilet chain pull. This was done so quickly that the point of making a bomb was lost. 
Holmes mentally planning his fights was also silly, you cannot plan a fight like that as you do not know what your opponent's counter moves will. It broke the continuity of the encounters and wasted time. How as Watson an able to get the explosives in place to bring down the tower on Moriarty? There were also many anacronisms such as was directly injecting adrenaline into the heart known in the Victorian age? The whole thing was reminiscent of the super hero genre. 
Personally I think the Cumberbatch/Freeman series and the Holmes in New York series much more connected to the original characters",Null,1,4,18 June 2018
Star Trek," Should be titled Star Drek
","This as far from sci fi as Mickey mouse and Donald Duck. Three outstanding ridiculous and implausible stunts stand out. The 'two heroes' fly like superman
between the space ships with only masks for protection not to mention air and enter though a small aperture although they have no means of steering. Has the director never seen a real sci fi movie? Secondly the severely damaged Enterprise, no mention of any damage control or crew loss, falls towards Earth and descends below cloud level (Everest height) to make a miraculous return to orbit. Lastly Pine enters the reactor and in spite of massive radiation exposure
is able by brute strength to kick the engine back into alignment. He dies of course. let us hope the franchise died with him. I fear not however. The other thing that always annoys me in this kind of movie, is the huge hallways. Space is at a premium in space (pun). What are they for, you never see large numbers of people using them? In fact you never see much of the ordinary crew members either. Even the earthly hotels do not have wide corridors, space is expensive, especially on space ships.",1,9,18,23 March 2020
"I Love You, Man"," Dedicated to expsing the American male
","This movie which I assume is based in some way on what the US male is actually like, seems dedicated to illustrating how vacuous and stupid the 'modern' American male can be. On the plus side Sydney is a good guitarist so why is he not in a band? He also seems to have no visible means of support though he has many possessions, in other words a parasite on society. He seems to be a user of women as wel.l He also horror of horrors thinks it is OK to leave his dog's droppings on the sidewalk. I am amazed nobody has shot him yet or at least given him a hiding
I found his character quite repellent.",1,0,1,23 May 2020
Non-Stop," Empty Gun
","Marks at last decides to trust the NYPD officer and hands him his gun, A short time later the officer is shot and asks Mtaks 'you gave me an empty gun!'. What trained experienced police officer would fail to check the gun, to see if (a) it has a round in the chamber (b) it has rounds in the magazine?",8,0,0,8 September 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," Seriously?
","I cannot believe people are actually praising this crap. For the first 20 minutes I did not know what was going on. I suppose it is funny if you are 10 yrs old, The special effects must have cost a fortune and are mostly pointless and reminiscent of the Matrix. The Groot was an idea obviously borrowed from LOTR's talking trees. I confess I would not normally waste my time on this kind of Marvel nonsense as I do have the American passion for comic books, but there was nothing else on so I watched it. People whizz about the 'galaxy' faster than the cops arrive in crime movies, Quite ridiculous.",2,0,6,23 March 2020
Elysium," Completely lacking in real science
","Every thing has been said before, except the completely nonsensical computer that could heal all illnesses and injuries in a couple of minutes, even Kruger's face being blown off! Grenade fragments would have entered his brain for a start so he could not have escaped brain damage. Plus where were the fragments which would have been removed? The girl as far as I noted had three completely different illnesses. First when on crutches she was diagnosed with multiple broken bones, even with crutches she could not have been walking, then later as having seizures and also leukemia A similar computer was seen in the movie Prometheus one year before so maybe they borrowed the idea from there. Jodie Foster was wasted in the movie as she had basically a walk on part, though projected pure psychopathy in the brief time she was on screen.",3,0,4,31 May 2017
Sinister," Not scared at all
","Ghost kids? for goodness sake grow up. Hawke the only 'star' in the movie is completely wasted. He moves into a house where a mass murder took place and which would have been exhaustively investigated and all evidence removed by CSI
He finds home movies about that and previous murders and he does not think that strange and call the police! How ridiculous can it get?",2,0,2,11 October 2018
Wedding Crashers," Enjoyable romp
","Reviewers are mainly highlighting only the main characters but this movie is packed with
very well acted cameo roles . Notably the gay son, the nymphomaniac Claire.
The sweet and rather bewildered Gloria (Rachel McAdams always a delight to watch) Underused Jane Seymour, plus the rest of a very weird family and retainer. Will Ferrell, a bit over the top. We know all the time how it will end but a certain suspense is held . It must have been great fun to make this movie and the fun comes over very well",Null,1,1,5 September 2018
Prometheus," Ridley Scott ought to be ashamed
","I read the first 4 reviews and see that everything has been said already. Apart from the amazing visual effects this is a terrible movie with a quite unbelievable and in my opinion childish plot. In fact it has so may inconsistencies one can hardly call it a plot. To take a few points: The automated operating theatre does not know how to operate on women even though the owner of the ship is in fact a woman, but manages to do a caesarian on Shaw. The foetus appears to be a smooth creature with a few tentacles, however she manages to escape the pod without thevery lively foetus following her and immobilise it after just undergoing a major operation! Presumably by doing something to the machine. However a short time later the creature has not only escaped but grown into a huge octopus powerful enough to strangle the very powerful alien; a little later another creature bursts out of the body of the dead alien, and guess what? It looks exactly like the 'alien' from the movie Alien. There are so many weird creatures/infections on screen but they seem to be unrelated. Surely the very advanced 'people' who visited earth could have killed off any dangerous life forms inhabiting their 'ship'. The 'snakes' also seem capable of easily smashing the helmet bubbles of the astronauts. There is also the signal of a life form on the scanner which disappears and is called just a 'glitch', surely so far in the future the technology would be so far advanced that 'glitches' would not occur. The 'alien ship' also seems to be part cave and part high tech space vehicle, capable of taking off after 2000 years of idleness! It also looks like a doughnut with a bite taken out of it. Finally I am getting tired of film makers showing huge spacious space vehicles, with vast halls and corridors. In this case a huge private space pod with a grand piano!! maybe that was supposed to be a joke. Do they not know anything about space travel in which interior space would be at a premium?",5,2,3,16 May 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Wildly improbable
","If this was really based on actual events as they happened I will eat my shorts. As a number of people have pointed out, not only is a 100 foot sheer cliff very topographically unlikely except on a beach, how on earth did the Japanese allow a climbing net being erected on it and then not simply chop it down? 'Duh' the Americans are climbing up to kill us so we will allow them to do it. A competent machine gunner could have mowed them down as they appeared at the top anyway, as shown in reverse when the Jap soldiers appear at the edge in pursuit of Doss and are shot to bits by the Americans below. I really hate unrealistic films especially those claiming to show reality!
BTW Braveheart was not a great movie, it also claimed to be realistic and compeletely departed from historical reality. An exciting movie maybe.",2,2,6,1 July 2019
