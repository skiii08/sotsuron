It," Was it a comedy movie?
","It didn't feel like a horror movie, everybody in the theater was laughing all the time due the humour in the cast, the kids make jokes all the time about everything, i was a little disappointed because i hoped i would be terrified, but i laughed more than anything. Its not a horror movie at all, its like a parody of a horror movie.",7,43,90,8 September 2017
