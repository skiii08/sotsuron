The Ring," A major Dissapointment
","SPOILER I never saw the Japanese original  but it most certainly had to have been better than this lame remake.  The Ring ends up being nothing more than a dragged out wild goose chase to find out why you die 7 days after watching some video.  When I first heard the premise, I was skeptical that such a juvenile plot could be pulled off.  The  explanation at the end of the film - that you are killed by the ghost of a little girl that died 7 days after being dumped in a well, is a far-fetched letdown to the big buildup the rest of the film provides.  And if this is intending to be a horror movie, it's a half-hearted attempt with only a handful of scary images sprinkled throughout it's 2 hour duration.   If you consider Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, and the Friday the Thirteenth series good horror, you'll probably want to waste your time watching The Ring - otherwise don't bother. This movie gets a 4 by me and that's being generous....",Null,0,1,7 June 2003
