Walk the Line," Life changing experience...
","If I didn't see this movie I would never know who Johnny Cash really was. At first I thought this movie will suck because I don't really biographies. They always make it look boring (except the doors) so I was expecting a 2 hour long drama which I will forget very soon. But... after 10 minutes of watching 'Walk the Line' I was stunned. I couldn't lay my eyes off TV. Songs were awesome, acting was perfect, story was real and there was no single boring moment. You know... those moments when you just go to the bathroom or take something to eat. When the movie ended I was under a lot of impression. I thought about the movie for weeks and of course, Johnny Cash was my new idol. I saw 'Walk the Line' 2 years ago and I can still watch it every day if I have to. I think this is my top 50 movies of all time which is weird because, as I said, I normally hate this kind of films. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Whiterspoon actually performed all the songs by themselves and it really sounds good. Is there anything else I should say about this movie? I think not. You gotta see it for yourself. This movie could change your life or at least some aspects of your life. Get off the internet and get 'Walk the Line' as quickly as possible. I recommend you watch it alone so you don't get distracted. Enjoy it!",10,2,3,30 January 2008
Pulp Fiction," Movie Of My Life... seriously
","Did anyone ever made a perfect movie? Probably not. But who did get closest to that? I think Quentin Tarantino. This movie is easily getting in my top 5 best movies ever made. It has everything. Great dialogs (monologs, hehe bible quote), very charismatic characters, interesting story, great soundtrack and it's full of anthology scenes. In fact, I think every scene can be taken as one of the best in film history. This is definitely Tarantino's top film he made. The acting crew is also perfect. Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta had roles of their life here. There's no way you won't like them and you just gotta listen to their dialogs. They are just so damn cool. And I have to add... This movie has one of the best opening scenes. Restaurant robbery and misirlou music, oh boy... After watching this movie I was very impressed. Actually I can't find words to describe it. Till this day I don't know how many times I watched it and I'm sure I will watch it again and again and again and... Well, you got the point! haha... Maybe the best words to describe Pulp Fiction are... Quote: 'If I get chance to choose the last movie I will see in my life that would be PF'... Need to say anything else?",10,1,4,1 February 2008
