Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," all show and no go
","This film was, as confirmed by Lucasfilm Ltd., 95% special effects and 0% actual story.  My complaints include the extended podracing sequence (I'm sure George Lucas could have saved a couple mill by reducing that by 45 seconds) and the war between the droids and the sea people. (By the way, what was that thing the fish was holding up at the end of the movie? I'm not reading the books to find out). Although it had its moments, it doesn't live up to its legacy.",Null,0,1,30 May 1999
The Sound of Music," the best musical ever made!
","In (definitely) Fox's finest film, Julie Andrews brings to live the fascinating epic of Maria Von Trapp and her 7 children.  Some of the worst parts of this movie (if there were any) are better than the best parts of modern films (SHE'S ALL THAT and EVER AFTER come to mind!) and redifined the movie musical.Julie Andrews should be given her much-deserved academy award (she was beaten by the unknown Julie Christie in 1965 [Ha! big mistake!]) and then everyone would be happy.",Null,0,5,30 May 1999
