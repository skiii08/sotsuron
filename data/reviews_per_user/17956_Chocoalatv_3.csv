First Man," Don't sit in the front seats
","We sat at the very back seats in the IMAX theater and yet we almost got sick from the constant shaky camerawork. Hence minus 1.It was overall pretty well made with superb actors, but I was expecting a little more human drama - deeper into Neil's character - so another minus 1.Also, I got a bit confused about the timeline because I don't know much about American history in the moon exploration. This is due to my lack of knowledge so no minus here.",8,0,0,21 October 2018
Captain Marvel," LOVED IT
","I loved the whole movie but especially enjoyed how Carol became SUPER POWERFUL and singlehandedly took down the enemy toward the end.
And of course LOVED the cat! :)",10,7,27,14 March 2019
Me Before You," Not horrible, but not great either
","I am sorry to say this but either Emilia Clarke is not a good actress, or the director sucks at directing. Her performance was a little too exaggerated and almost comical. I don't think this was meant to be a comedy, but maybe it was...? Possibly so, at least Lou and Patrick seemed like they were supposed to be funny.The storyline was okay but not believable.
Maybe it's better to read the book; it could well be that they edited out too much information?? but I wasn't convinced that Will absolutely had to make that awful decision.I did love Lou's fashion - it kind of reminded me of 'Am√©lie' - colorful and corky. I also loved to see Tywin from Game of Thrones and lovely Mr. Bates from 'Downton Abbey.' Hence one extra star.",7,3,3,16 February 2019
