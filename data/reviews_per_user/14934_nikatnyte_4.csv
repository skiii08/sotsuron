The Lobster," I like a film that makes you think, but...
","There's certainly food for thought in this bizarre film. A dystopian present (not future, as some suggest), in which being solitary is a crime punishable by death (or being turned into an animal, as citizens are led to believe). Why? People are celebrated for coupling, even though their relationship is based on superficial commonalities like bleeding noses or short-sightedness. Why? Those who rebel and seek salvation through being solitary are punished when they seek connection with someone else. Why? There are no clues to the answers to these questions. It's a disturbing world, but I couldn't for the life of me figure out what the filmmakers were trying to tell me. Watch out for those who tell you how to live, and with whom? There are far better ways to convey this message than this mystifying film. I enjoyed its cryptic nature, and the performances, but that can only take you so far. Style is not art.",6,1,5,9 June 2016
Crash," Superb dissection of racism
","'Crash' examines the racism in our society that is always there beneath the surface, yet boils to the top in moments of stress and pressure. It has an at times too-clever interlocking- stories structure that, while showing our interconnectedness as individuals, does occasionally come across as too contrived and pat. Yet so much about this film is wonderful. The performances are superb -- Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton and Ryan Phillippe (of all people) stand out, yet really everyone is good. And the 'message' of the film, which some may say is a bit heavy-handed, is valid and uplifting: that ultimately our salvation lies in our humanity and getting to know one another beyond just the surface stereotypes.",8,1,8,10 May 2005
Lost in Translation," Looking beneath the surface
","Reading some of the unfavorable reviews here made me realize how over- conditioned to the typical Hollywood formula many filmgoers are. While I don't  think 'Lost in Translation' is perfect, it is a refreshing change from the cookie- cutter mainstream romantic comedies that usually flood the market. Yes, the Bill  Murray/Scarlett Johanssen relationship is not defined by witty sitcom dialogue,  musical cues or tidy resolutions. It's depicted in a far more real, believable way.These are two lonely and searching people who connect on a level not conveniently communicated by their conversations or through formulaic sex. It's  mysterious and ambiguous, like many profound relationships are. This is definitely a movie about what lies beneath the surface, in a city and country  where the surface is often gaudy and over-the-top.  I found myself wanting just a  teeny bit more of a plotline, but perhaps that shows my own conditioning.  'Lost  in Translation' offers something that is much deeper.",Null,0,0,22 October 2003
Contact," Wonderful film with a weak ending
","Often it helps to let some time pass before truly assessing a film (or any work of art, for that matter). I viewed 'Contact' again recently after 7 years, and was both impressed (as I was before) but more frustrated this time. The film does a great job raising issues regarding extraterrestrial contact, all enveloped within a very engrossing story. But the ending left me cold. Ellie had been set up to be a strong, articulate, bright scientist -- clearly vastly superior to the Tom Skerritt character. Yet after her interstellar journey, she's not only mercilessly grilled by a huge Congressional committee (the James Woods character was way over the top) but reacts like a spoiled schoolgirl. ('What? Are you saying you don't believe me?!'). I would have expected a much different assessment of her experience than that from the government, and a much more articulate defense from her. Nevertheless, 'Contact' is an extremely well-made, thought-provoking film.",Null,1,3,15 February 2005
