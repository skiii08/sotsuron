Changeling," Runs well over 2 hours, feels like 4.
","Boooooor-ring. That's about all that can be said. Running time of over 2 hours feels like four by the end. Not even good as a chick flick, due to the total lack of romance. Angelina Jolie performs passably well in the hopeless task of breathing life into this corpse of a film, but even she cannot do much with the material. Worse than that, the 1930's era clothing doesn't even give one a chance to appreciate Jolie's physical beauty. No sex, no violence, no romance, no action - to whom was this movie meant to appeal? The sets were almost laughable, as apparently everyone in 1928 drove perfectly immaculate, polished cars that look like they were driven directly to the set from a 2008 antique auto show. The clothing and interiors were the same - perfect, clean, polished, immaculate. Better throw in surreal and fake. As a big Clint Eastwood fan, as well as an admirer of Angelina, I had high hopes for this film. Sadly, none were met. Don't even bother to rent it. It's just not worth it.",3,4,15,5 June 2009
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Pathetic successor to brilliant original trilogy
","This movie is so unbelievably bad, it is almost unwatchable. This trip to the theatre was one of the few times I seriously considered asking for my money back. The characters were forgettable, the plot ridiculous, and I *hate* movies where some Whiz Kid is the hero. My friend brought his 2 children, aged 4 and 5, which was good, since the entire movie was aimed toward them. Almost all of the special effects money went to creating aliens who were virtually unconnected to the plot. When the Jedi was killed near the end I thought, 'who cares' since I couldn't even remember his NAME at that point. On the drive home, I realized that I couldn't name the alien with the big ears, or the Queen or Princess or whoever she was. And I had just seen the movie! If all of them had been killed, I would have just shrugged. The plot, along with the ridiculously bad writing and acting, made it impossible to care about them. All this from a man who saw the original Star Wars 50 - yes FIFTY! - times IN THE THEATRE!A truly pathetic successor to the brilliant original trilogy.",1,1,3,24 June 2005
United 93," Brilliant documentary
","United 93 is a gripping, dramatic tear-jerker - all the more so because it is completely true. As my movie companion said upon exiting 'There is absolutely nothing Hollywood about it.' I couldn't have said it better myself. This should be a lesson to Michael Moore on how to construct a brilliant documentary. Whereas Moore's works are essentially propaganda films for the wacko left, this movie presents the facts as they happened - with no narration, no extraneous back-story, and no sledgehammer commentary. When watching United 93, the viewer has no idea of the political views of the director (he is a liberal). That is the way it should always be, and never is in Moore's propaganda films. This director's use of the many of the original participants in re-creating the scene of 9-11 makes it all the more real. The use of the hand-held camera adds an air of real-time drama. All in all, this will probably be the penultimate story of what really happened on 9-11. Every American who sees it cannot help but remember where they were on that terrible day. 9-11 is, after all, the Kennedy assassination of our generation.",9,0,3,5 May 2006
The Notebook," Poignant but predictable
","I just viewed this movie last night, as part of a $5 bet with a girl. She told me she would pay me $5 if I did not like the movie. Since she had been right before, most notably with the enjoyable Bill Murray vehicle LOST IN TRANSLATION, I decided to give this one a try.My verdict? Standard 'chick flick' with the obligatory tear-jerking moments. Unusually predictable storyline even for a woman's movie, standard to substandard acting, and obviously fake facial hair which provides an unintentional comic distraction. While it was pleasant to see the former YOUNG HERCULES star trying a dramatic role, he looked lost without his companions from that show, and possibly a good fight scene to liven up the plot. Of course, if it contained a good fight, it wouldn't be a 'chick flick' - would it guys?It is not a bad film, and it has a good message. Trust me though - I was happy to collect the $5 at the end, and that made the whole evening worthwhile. Skip this film - unless you're trying to impress a girl of course.",3,5,7,6 November 2005
The Girl Next Door," Timothy Olyphant shines
","This is an enjoyable yet ultimately forgettable film. The 'boy rescues cute girl from terrible life' plot has been done many times before, no doubt in many better ways. Emile Hirsch performs passably well with the material he is given, and the luscious Elisha Cuthbert provides plenty of eye candy that she could not show in 24. The rest of the characters are one-dimensional and barely worthy of mention. But the show belongs to Timothy Olyphant. Although he does not even appear until halfway through the film, his role makes the entire movie worth watching again. He screen presence is palpable as the ultra-cool bad boy that every man secretly wishes to be. Scruffy, chain-smoking, alternately funny, friendly then dangerous, he owns every scene in which he appears. Seeing this film makes one that much more anxious for the next season of JUSTIFIED to begin!",7,10,10,1 December 2010
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Even worse than THE PHANTOM MENACE
","My comment about THE PHANTOM MENACE began thus: 'This movie is so unbelievably bad, it is almost unwatchable.' Upon returning from the theatre on opening day of this execrable fiasco, my friend asked me what I thought of it. I answered, 'Remember when I said The Phantom Menace was the worst movie of all time? Well, we have a new champion.' Lucas seems bent on redefining the movie-going experience as neither entertaining, thoughtful, uplifting nor fun. I have seen both of the first two 'new' Star Wars movies, and could not tell you right now what the two sides are, or what they are fighting about. He has turned the battle for good and evil into a CGI version of a 3-hour John Kerry lecture about 'nuance.' This leads to the worst sin a movie (which is entertainment, after all) can commit - it is BORING. Where is the genius that brought us American Graffiti and the original STAR WARS trilogy? Gone, most likely gone forever. He will be missed.",1,4,10,24 June 2005
Cold Mountain," Ridiculously predictable and BORING
","This is the kind of film that women almost universally like, and men generally hate. Jude Law gives a wooden performance as a deserter from the Confederate Army whose one mission is to return to Nicole Kidman, a woman whom he barely knows. Along his merry journey home, he meets a collection of other cowards and deserters, and has many adventures. Historical inaccuracies abound as apparently the entire Confederate Army was trying to desert, and the film lovingly celebrates these acts of cowardice. Kidman herself, whose meager talent has always been grossly overrated, gives another forgettable performance here. The one bright spot is Rene Zellweger, who gives the film some welcome comic relief. She plays a woman who apparently is one of the few people in the South with a Southern accent. Her performance is marred only by one over-the-top antiwar speech, intended to be a dramatic highlight of the film but which turns out to be unintentionally hilarious. Ethan Suplee and Giovanni Ribisi are also good in minor roles, as both apparently are developing their characters for use in MY NAME IS EARL. Except for some interesting battle scenes early on, there is nothing at all in this movie to hold a man's attention. It plods on at such an excruciating pace that Jude Law's death is a welcome signal that the end of the film is near. An hour of the film could easily be cut with no loss of quality.",2,4,11,24 October 2007
Meet Joe Black," A pleasant surprise!
","I just finished watching this movie. What a pleasant surprise! Either it was woefully under-advertised or I was living under a rock at the time, but this movie is well worth seeing. I sat down to watch it just because it had the great Anthony Hopkins in it. I did not even know until his appearance that Brad Pitt was even associated with this project. Normally I consider Pitt a 'woman's actor' in that he acts primarily in films that appeal to women. But occasionally he has shown flashes of talent (such as SEVEN MONKEYS), and he does again in this film. The doe-eyed beauty of Claire Forlani is the perfect complement to him. While both rich and beautiful, she comes across as someone who looks for something deeper in a man than Pitt's obvious physical charms. I am surprised she has not been in other big-budget films, since this was made in 1998. With his under-appreciated charm, Jeffrey Tambor plays his usual character of the slightly dim-witted loser, and Anthony Hopkins is good as always. But this is a star vehicle for Pitt, and he is surprisingly up to the task. I had intended to watch and discard this movie, but now it is a keeper for my video library. Guys - this is a perfect date film. We should all keep a couple of 'chick flicks' like this on hand, that appeal to women but are more thought-provoking than just their usual Titanic-level garbage.",7,1,2,24 June 2005
There Will Be Blood," Boring, plodding and excruciatingly long.
","Hollywood, like the rest of society, has its own political correctness. This is one of those films that everyone is supposed to admire. Supposedly, the characters are deep and dark and very complex. Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the best actors working today, blah, blah blah. Almost all of this is garbage. This film has the worst attribute of anything in the entertainment industry - it is not entertaining. Boring would be a better term. Dull, plodding and excruciatingly long. The moments of interest are few and far between, and far too fleeting to make this movie worth watching. One leaves the film primarily with a sense of wonder as to why Hollywood thinks it is so noteworthy. It is not, except perhaps as a example of the bad films Hollywood increasingly tells us (the public) that we SHOULD like. There is a growing disconnect between the films celebrated at the Academy Awards and those films that the public actually enjoys. No wonder the audience for the Awards dwindles each year. Continued celebration of boring, forgettable films such as this will ensure the Academy's increasing irrelevance.",3,10,16,1 April 2008
Wonder Woman," Gadot - wonderful! The rest of the film? Not so much. :(
","I finally got around to watching WONDER WOMAN last night. Despite its popularity and all the rave reviews, it is mediocre at best. Gal Gadot herself is wonderful and a perfect choice for the part. She is able to project both the strength, courage and determination of a superhero, as well as empathy, love and happiness with equal ease. Her lithe, athletic form fits well into the costume, highlighting her natural sexiness. She is every bit the fighter you would expect, the worthy successor to the warrior tradition of her mother and her aunt. The scenes on her home island are the best in the film. I enjoyed watching the character as a young child and later beginning her training. Robin Wright again demonstrates her acting skills in a small but memorable role as Antiope. The training and battle sequences on the island are a pleasure to watch. The use of super slow-motion is truly amazing.But then of course, it is time for our young heroine to leave the island....and the movie promptly falls apart. The entire storyline becomes absolutely ludicrous. And I don't mean 'comic-book' silly, I mean downright stupid. The grossly-overrated Chris Pine is hopelessly overmatched by Gadot, and the ancillary characters are the predictable group of politically-correct caricatures. Half the characters in the film could simply have been written out completely. The final superhero battle does restore some dignity, but not as much as it should. By that point, the ridiculous plot had so insulted my intellect and wasted my time that I had already begun to check my watch – which is always my personal gauge for a film's success or failure. Watch this film, just to see Gal Gadot. She really is the embodiment of a superhero. But even her superior strength can't drag the baggage of this train wreck through to the end.",4,3,11,21 October 2017
