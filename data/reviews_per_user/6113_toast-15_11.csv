Walk the Line," made me interested in Johnny Cash
","I saw this movie yesterday. Or rather, I should say that I saw the second half of it. I missed the first half but found the film so engrossing that I started to watch even not knowing who half the characters were. I've never been a fan of country music but I am now a fan of Johnny Cash. What a life he led and the love between him and June was made real and powerful to the viewer thanks to stunningly true performances by Phoenix and Witherspoon. I never knew that June had written Ring of Fire before and knowing that the song is about a painful love, it was clear that she was very deeply in love with Johnny Cash for a very long time before they were married and he with her, making their long tortured romance even more painful. Finally she consents at the end but I really don't know why it took so long. Maybe there was some truth in what Johnny said to her on the bus. The old saying, 'the lady doth protest too much, methinks' (Shakespeare)Just wanted to mention that I intend to buy the DVD so I can watch the whole movie and I've ordered Cash's first autobiography. Very good film; very good acting, very interesting people!",10,1,1,10 April 2008
Memento," ever heard of a journal?
","At first, a rather likable but pitiful guy seems to engage the viewer and you want to be interested in his plight but you soon realize that the lead character is not really a protagonist. And about 1/3 of the way in, you start questioning why this mentally handicapped individual doesn't take better notes. Why not a journal or tape recorder, even a camcorder? He leaves himself pictures of people and things with 1 sentence notes that he sometimes describes as 'fact' but are little more than here-say or supposition. Now this would be fine for someone who just needs to jog their memory but for someone with no short term memory at all the scenario is ludicrous. For example, instead of simply stating 'don't trust so and so', a journal entry or tape recorded message fully stating why not to trust someone would be perfectly understandable but it isn't done. At one point, this person who is completely reliant on pens has no pen or any other writing utensil. In fact, he sees the person he is conversing with hiding all of the pens and he doesn't question that? OK, I need to suspend my disbelief. It does become apparent at the very end, that there is no 'wife killer' and he really isn't all that innocent in his wife's current condition. He seems to dispatch anyone who confronts him with truth or reality yet he welcomes those who would use him for their own means. Killing is killing to him I guess; and reasons can be manipulated to achieve the end result as long as the end result is another death. Shoddy notes are just a means to an end. One gets the impression that he might enjoy killing, and manipulating his memory is just as good an excuse as any in his demented mind. In the end, the only one being taken for a ride is the viewer.",6,1,2,1 September 2011
Chicken Run," Great film that builds to an exciting, suspense-filled conclusion
","I am a big fan of the Wallace and Gromit shorts, and while I would love to see a feature length film on them, I thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful film. I appreciated all of the work that went into this production without all the computer graphics that are so prevalent today.  It was good, old fashioned stop motion animation and it was perfect!  The ending is the best part.  Don't miss this movie; it's absolutely for anyone and everyone.",7,0,0,25 June 2000
Pan's Labyrinth," slasher horror flick masquerading as epic fantasy
","**contains spoilers** Have you ever had a miserably bad experience at a restaurant that you previously had thought would be stellar because of all the good reviews? This movie is that restaurant. It's all hype but the king has no clothes, though few would admit it. What it really is is a badly done horror movie hiding behind the facade of a fantasy wrapped in a war movie. What better ploy to show gobs of blood and gore? This movie is a blood fest and the only love the director shows for any of his characters, is the loving embrace by the camera every time blood is in the scene. Someone is stitching his own mouth: Close-up please! Someone is being beaten about the head: Close-up please! Someone is being tortured: Close-up please! Someone needs an amputation: Close-up please! It was so ridiculous that I almost expected to see 'Blood' make an appearance in the screen credits. You know you're watching a bad movie when every single major character takes actions that are completely out of character and it doesn't take long to figure out that the reason for such is that you are being rather obviously manipulated because the director has another blood fest to embrace in the next scene. Incidents don't occur to advance the plot, they occur to advance the gore. In one scene the rebels actually start a campfire in midday in clear view of the enemy base camp. At first you think that no rebel army could be so stupid and that it is probably a trap. Well, think again. There is no trap; they actually did start a fire in the middle of the day for no other apparent reason other than, one presumes, to warm their lunch! The rebel army is composed of morons who leave astonishingly stupid clues behind so that key benefactors can later be implicated and/or murdered (in gory close-up, of course). The rebels have a spy at the enemy base camp but do you think the spy would take the opportunity to poison the enemy leader? No, of course not. Instead, the spy uses her plumb position to act as postal carrier! When she actually does have a prime opportunity to kill the enemy leader, she instead squanders it by simply cutting his mouth open. (How else could you have the self-stitching close-ups later on?) She then leaves and walks right past the very people who apprehended her in the first place. Did she honestly think she wouldn't get caught walking in plain view of them? The stupidity of the characters in this movie is mind boggling. This isn't Hitchcockian suspense, it's more like B movie schlock fest alerts; every time someone does something stupid, you know blood will follow. The stupidity isn't what you would expect from characters in a real first rate movie. However, the stupidity is exactly what you would expect in a movie like Freddie vs. Jason or some such teen slasher movie. And that's really all that this is; it's a slasher masquerading as a fantasy wrapped in a war movie. After all, you have to at least pretend to have some semblance of a plot. When someone finally does decide to poison the enemy leader, he occasionally stumbles but otherwise, the lethal dose has little impact; exactly what one would expect from the hard-to-kill 'Jason' type character typical of most slasher movies. But what I found most offensive of all was the death scene where the little girl is by herself with the spy a few steps away, not even comforting/hugging her but instead humming a wordless 'lullaby' that sounds more like a depressing and wordless funeral dirge. Aberrant and abhorrent.",1,9,24,18 July 2011
Pride & Prejudice," it's not that it's so bad
","It's just that it's been done so much better already . The 1995 BBC production for T.V. is far superior to this, rendering the 2005 movie version, nearly unwatchable. Jane Austen novels are gems in and of themselves but too many times, we see modern day feminists trying to wrangle in their views into a story line or setting where it was never meant to be. This not only makes the final outcome untrue to the novel but a sacrilege to Jane Austen fans. In real Jane Austen story lines there are men who are good, and men who are not, there are women who are good and women who are not. There is no one side is better than the other garbage. Jane Austen was not a feminists, she was a humanist. She saw good in both sexes. The men in this movie are either twittering idiots, indolent, charlatans or conceited. Case in point, Bingley is described in the book as easy going, friendly and socially proficient but in this movie he is a numbskull and couldn't hold a conversation if his life depended on it. Also, they didn't live side by side with filthy animals roaming about in their house. The Bennet girls also took great care in their appearance which wasn't evident at all in this movie. I just don't understand why so much was changed. It was a disappointment.",3,7,15,13 April 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," excellent when viewed as part of a larger story
","******This comment contains spoilers********** I saw this film about a week ago and it took this long to finally organize my thoughts. I have to say that I felt sad after watching episode three and only knowing that IV, V, and especially VI end on a much happier note was I able to justify the bleak ending. Taken as a whole, I am awed by Lucas' storytelling ability. There are elements in the earlier movies that are explained in the more recent episodes that only someone with at least an idea of the whole story right from the start could have managed. Yes, there are a few glitches in past movies that become obvious or irreconcilable with the newest installment like when Leia, in episode VI tells Luke that she remembers her mother being sad, and that she was beautiful. How could she? We now know that the mother died right after childbirth? But if that's all I could manage to find fault with after 6 movies, it's really pretty insignificant.I think the actor that plays Annakin/Vader (Hayden Christiansen) has grown professionally in the newest installment. For me at least, episode II and even I were almost unwatchable but here there is real drama and Ewan McGregor also stands out as an exceptional actor. You can almost see the old Obi Wan taking shape under this actor's deft command of his craft. The scene where he's replaying the events that befell the younglings was particularly tender. His eyes tell the whole story and it's very powerful.All in all, if you've seen any of the other Star Wars movies, you won't want to miss this one. It ties all of the previous films together and is a modern day classic of storytelling art. I loved it. However, if you've never seen any of the films, I'd suggest watching episodes IV, V, and VI first, then going on to III and if you can handle it, I and II for the story of Annikan's upbringing and the backstory of the politics and intrigue of Senator Palpatine.",7,4,11,30 May 2005
Sherlock Holmes," dumb and boring
","I actually had high hopes for this movie. I went with a big crowd of people and while they planned to see Avatar I was going to see Sherlock Holmes. Unfortunately for them, Avatar was sold out so they all joined me in this train wreck of a movie. To be fair, there are about 10 minutes total that are kind of interesting. But the movie is 2 hours and 15 minutes long so there's the problem. There are so many plot holes that a mack truck could drive through and even with suspension of disbelief, it is truly a hodge podge of dreck with loud noises interspersed amongst the dreck to keep you awake. We are supposed to believe that Irene Adler is so strong as to heave a drugged and out-of-it Holmes from off the floor by the fireplace and onto a bed and then strip and handcuff him to the bed posts. They don't show you any of this because it would be laughably unbelievable. She must be super human to accomplish such a feat. There are other ridiculous stupidities that I thought perhaps were aimed at teens but the teens that were with me actually fell asleep because it was so boring. Every once in a while one of the sleeping teens would nod awake at a loud explosion. One such explosion completely engulfed the major characters yet in the next scene, not a burn mark is to be found. Apparently people in Holmes' day were made of asbestos. Don't waste your money. I like R.D.J. but this was a waste of time and money.",1,113,212,2 January 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," timeless and classic
","I avoided seeing this film for years because I thought it was a grim prison uprising tale from Stephen King. Well, I was one third right, it is set in a prison but it is a very good story about friendship, honesty, forgiveness/redemption, patience and loyalty. I'm going to really try and not give away too much of the film because if you haven't seen it yet, you are missing out on a great story. It's set in a prison in the late 40's. Some of the inmates have been there since the early part of the 20th century and with repeated parole denials and no rehabilitation in sight, many have been institutionalized and have lost hope and even lost sight of their own identity. When one such inmate is released, he walks into a world that he barely recognizes. He tries but in the end, fails to make it in the real world and succumbs to desperation and hopelessness. We see some of the guards greedily taking part in violence that is so vicious that it is difficult to discern the prisoners from the prison staff. But, ultimately it is a tale of redemption and the story unfolds with hardship, humor and grace. This is a film that I will see again and again.",10,1,1,4 September 2011
Shrek," beautifully animated new classic fairy tale
","***Possible Spoilers**** The first thing I noticed while watching this movie was the exquisitely beautiful scenery behind the action.  I don't think my two kids noticed that part as much as I did; they were too busy laughing at the ogre's grooming habits.  At first I thought the ogre's voice was all wrong, too small with an on-again off-again hint of Scotland; but since I never met an ogre before and, consequently, never heard one speak, who am I to say that that's not right!  So I let the movie take me to the land of 3 blind mice and sleeping beauties....and I thoroughly and totally LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT!I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone and everyone no matter how old/young or how jaded/naive.  I want to go to the land of fairy tales too! How do I get there!P.S.  I especially loved the humorous references to Disney parks and animated films.",8,0,0,2 June 2001
Amélie," Everything is perfect
","The first time I saw Jean-Pierre Jeunet's masterpiece I was swept away by its story, the second time by its music, the third time by its atmosphere, the fourth time by its nuance and style, the fifth time by its whimsy, the sixth time by its justice, the seventh time by its compassion. I've seen this movie more times than I can count and each time I do, I see something new to love. This is the only movie that I was determined to buy both the movie DVD and the soundtrack CD. I must have played and replayed the scene where Amélie (Audrey Tautou) is skipping stones while Yann Tiersen's hauntingly beautiful Comptine D'un Autre Ete: L'apres Midi plays in the background countless times as well. The first time I heard it was the first time that I realized that modern classical composers are just as good or better than those that are only revered in death. Everything about this movie is beautiful. This movie is like a perfect flower, delicate and beautiful but fully apparent only to those that take the time to see its true essence in all of its myriad of miracles that touch the senses.",10,3,7,16 September 2011
The Island," A very brave movie to make considering the hostile climate for debate
","I just saw this movie and thought it was very good. It has a futuristic sci-fi setting, a science based debate, i.e., the moral or ethical value of cloning, plenty of action scenes, and lots of suspense. I saw this with a room full of people and we all thought it was great. I'm left puzzled by the poor critical reception it received and the bad marketing campaign. Maybe the critics were just upset that this movie dealt with the question of whether cloning creates another human life and they don't want people to think in those terms. Or, as some people like to say, it's not a life if it's in a petri dish. Even SCNT (somatic cell nuclear transfer) creates an embryo. When is it human? Are adult stem cells really inferior to embryonic stem cells? Or is it just more profitable to make a 'product' (creating new organs or even new life with ESC derived from SCNT) rather than use existing adult stem cells to repair damaged organs. I don't believe you can patent adult stem cells, perhaps that's really why ESC are more 'valuable' to some people. The movie makes mention more than once of the profit motive behind the clones.The biggest advancement in ESC has been proved to be a fraud (see current headlines regarding S. Korean cloner.) I give the following link as a mere sample: http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/view.php?StoryID=20051227-041316-5554r but there are plenty more stories with more information.By contrast, every time there is an advancement with adult stem cells, they mysteriously drop the 'adult' to give the impression that the (adult) stem therapy has something to do with ESC when it doesn't. The reality is that stem cell breakthroughs touted in actual medical therapy have been achieved with adult stem cells, not ESC; yet ESC research gets more attention and more money. See following link: http://www.worldmag.com/subscriber/displayarticle.cfm?id=10284 This movie inspires debate, and that's a good thing!",9,0,0,29 December 2005
