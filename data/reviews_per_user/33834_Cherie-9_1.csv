The Blair Witch Project," Use your imagination
","This movie was incredibly intense.  I have already recommended it to many of my friends because I thought it was one of the scariest films (or perhaps film-experiences) I have ever seen.  This movie makes you use your imagination to find your own terror-level.  It may not be scary in form (it's not like other horror films with wall-to-wall gore and elaborate plot lines) but it is terrifying in practice.  Imagine reading a book--you put yourself into the story; you find yourself as one of the actors in it. Then, you go to see the movie.  The movies are never as good as the books they are made from because they tell you what to think instead of letting you think for yourself.  This movie is a book on screen.  You become one of the filmmakers.  You feel their exhaustion, their anger, their fear.  I loved it.  I let my imagination run with this movie, and believe me, it took off.  The last five minutes still haunt me; they were so intense that I cried from an overload of emotion. Crazy.  Go see it.  It's so worth your money.  (but go at night...much better that way)",10,1,2,10 August 1999
