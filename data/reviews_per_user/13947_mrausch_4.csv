Kill Bill: Vol. 2," not enough original spin on traditional genres
","Sometimes I think the mythology behind Quentin Tarantino is greater than the reality.  Tarantino, of course, attracted a following of critics and film buffs with his ultra-violent tale of cops, robbers and betrayal, Reservoir Dogs, then broke into Hollywood's upper echelon with his seminal tale of hitmen and other ne'er-do-wells, Pulp Fiction.  Pulp Fiction's music became annoyingly prevalent everywhere, and the dialogue between stars John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson was quoted everywhere.  Since then, however, Tarantino's record has not been all that impressive. He exec-produced and acted in From Dusk Till Dawn, his modern-day horror yarn of vampires in the dusty southwest desert, a miserable failure despite the star power of hunky George Clooney.  He returned to directing, and resurrected the career of 1970's black action star Pam Grier, with Jackie Brown, another intriguing tale of good guy thieves that failed to live up to the hype.  Along the way, there was always talk of Tarantino's genius, but it always centered around Pulp Fiction, and yet there was never any solid follow-up.  Then came Kill Bill, Vol. 1, with its quirky dialogue, impossibly high body count and kitschy homages to Sergio Leone `spaghetti westerns' and Bruce Lee `chop-socky' movies.  `Tarantino is back!' fans and critics exalted, and with the impending release of Kill Bill, Vol. 2, the anticipation has been strong and widespread.  But while Tarantino honored film masters and genres in his earlier movies through a sly reworking of codes and conventions, as well as a brilliance for scripting indelible dialogue, here he seems content to allow others to dictate his style.Kill Bill, Vol. 2 picks up where Vol. 1 left off, with the Bride, Beatrice Kiddo (Uma Thurman), having made it past numerous groups of hired killers, now hot on the trail of Bill (David Carradine) the man who left her for dead four years earlier after putting a bullet in her head.  She first sets her sights on Bill's brother, Budd (Michael Madsen), who sidetracks her for a while by burying her alive.  She moves on to Daryl Hannah's eye-patched Elle before ultimately coming face to face, once again, with her one-time mentor and murderer, Bill.Along the way, we get some of the back story leading up to Bill's attempted assassination of Beatrice filled in, as well as details of their relationship together, as a way of explaining his motivation for trying to do her in, so the film effortlessly crosscuts from past to present, as that which came before comments on the action at hand.  Bill's tutelage of Thurman's youthful assassin, his securing her apprenticeship with the harsh martial arts taskmaster, Pei Mei, and Bill's sense of betrayal resulting in the Massacre at the Two Pines which began this epic tale of bloody revenge.Tarantino pulls out all the stops in this homogenized homage to pop cinema history.  There's the Hitchcock-inspired black and white photography during the film's opening monologue.  A pullback from inside Two Pines recalls Orson Welles' audacious opening to Touch of Evil, while quick zoom-ins, flashy fast cuts, and the over-the-top acting of the white hair and bearded Pei Mei during Beatrice's grueling tutelage are culled from classic Kung Fu movies.  The desert scenes are accented by Hugo Montenegro-inspired music recalling Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, while other scenes are propelled by 70s influenced action music, calling to mind iconic influences like Chips, Starsky and Hutch and The Streets of San Francisco.But while Tarantino indulges his obvious fetish for classic pop culture and cinematic history, and while Kill Bill, Vol. 2 is very much a satisfying conclusion to this blood-soaked saga of retaliation and retribution, Tarantino gives us no surprises.  There is nothing here to make you sit up in your chair and gasp, `did that really just happen?'  Even the script, the Tarantino specialty that typically crackles with one pop reference after another, doesn't jump out with any wildly quotable lines of dialogue. That's because Tarantino seems so intent on saluting his own mentors by resurrecting their styles, he's forgotten to craft his own.",Null,0,1,28 April 2004
Cold Mountain," looks like nicole's audition tape for estee lauder
","There are many striking images to come out of Cold Mountain, the current screen adaptation of the novel by Charles Frazier about the final days of the America Civil War and one confederate soldier's arduous journey home to the woman he loves.  The magnificent vistas of the Appalachian Mountains in both winter and spring is one, as are the battle scenes with their gut-wrenching mix of mud and blood.  But perhaps the most enduring image, for better or worse, is Nicole Kidman as the film's heroine, Ada Monroe.Kidman, undoubtedly the screen's most luminous beauty at this moment, shines like a porcelain doll through much of the movie, while the rest of her cast-mates are covered in sweat, blood and grime.  Ironic, too, that she should remain such a vision throughout so much of the movie given the transformation she undergoes from pristine and protected preacher's daughter to independent farm-owner.  Unfortunately, Kidman, with her perfectly chiseled features, rouged cheeks and spun-gold hair, looks like she is from another movie, not the `at the end of her tether' heroine on the brink of ruin you expect here.Perhaps director Anthony Minghella wanted to present Ada in an idyllic light, showcase her as a fantasy of what her lover strives so mightily to return home to.  If that is the case, it is the one misstep Minghella makes in this outstanding epic of love, war, the ties that bind and man's inhumanity to man.  Minghella, whose other works include such outstanding films as The Talented Mr. Ripley and The English Patient, brings to bear his signature talent for deftly blending the epic and the intimate on this singularly captivating story.  Witness the grand scale of the battle at Petersburg in the film's opening moments, grand masses of men going to their slaughter, seamlessly intercut with shots of a tintype picture carefully preserved in a book, lovingly carried by a soldier far from home and his love.Cold Mountain centers around the love story between Kidman's Ada, the daughter of Donald Sutherland's Reverend Monroe, and Jude Law's Inman, a hard-working young man who is called to war.  She is only recently arrived in the North Carolina village of Cold Mountain, but they are immediately attracted to each other and profess their love for each other the day Inman is called to war.Injured in battle and captured by Union troops, Inman recovers enough that he escapes from his hospital bed and begins a long, perilous journey home to Ada.  Meanwhile, the death of the Reverend Monroe leaves Ada home alone with no means of support, no ability to till and maintain her farm, and a corrupt local law-keeper hanging around, determined to marry her for her farm. Fortune steps in and sends her Renee Zellweger's plain-looking, plain-talking and hard-working Ruby Thewes, who helps Ada get the farm up and running again.There are many delights to partake of in Cold Mountain, not the least of which is Jude Law's nearly dialouge-free performance as Inman.  Law holds the audience spellbound, projecting a quiet intensity and determination of will that seems to propel him toward home and Ada.  Along the way, he encounters a variety of characters who both help and hinder him, including Philip Seymour Hoffman as a disgraced priest, Giovanni Ribisi's duplicitous farmer and Natalie Portman's abandoned widow, left alone to care for the sick child of her dead husband.Her seemingly untouchable looks aside, Kidman creates a fascinating picture of the prototypic southern belle (though not in the Gone With the Wind, Jezebel tradition).  Her Ada embarks on a deeply personal, inward journey in which she encounters her own roster of memorable characters, from Ray Winstone's cruel lawkeeper , Kathy Baker's kind and nurturing neighbor and Brendan Gleeson's redeemed father to Zellweger's Ruby.As for Zellweger, she commits an overt act of piracy and steals Cold Mountain from both Kidman and Law.  Almost unrecognizable at her entrance, and using an accent that verges on parody, Zellweger's Ruby ultimately injects Cold Mountain with a boost of human comedy and drama that is at once thoroughly charming, heartbreaking and endearing.  She takes charge of the screen as assuredly as Ruby takes charge of Ada's farm, and just like Ruby, she complements, never detracts, from the central focus of the love story that is Ada and Inman.Orchestrating this entire enterprise, of course, in Minghella, the Oscar-winning director of The English Patient.  He is likely to be a top contender for that award again this year, given the burning passion he invests in Cold Mountain. (*** Â½)",Null,0,0,8 April 2004
Van Helsing," Fun action, but lacking in any true sense of horror
","Pop culture likes to emphasize that `this is not your father's (insert radio/TV/personal pastime here).'  Well, such is the case with Van Helsing, the new horror/action thriller, starring Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale. Based on the character who so valiantly fights Count Dracula in Bram Stoker's original novel, and who has been reincarnated on the screen by everyone from Edward Van Sloan (1931) to Peter Cushing (1958) to Sir Laurence Olivier (1979) to Sir Anthony Hopkins (1992), Jackman is hardly the Victorian Era drawing room intellectual who battles evil using crosses, wooden stakes and cloves of garlic so frequently resurrected for the screen. And that is to both the film's good and detriment. Jackman's Van Helsing, a black leather-clad, fedora-sporting adventurer, is employed by the Vatican to battle the world's monsters and evils.  Like some 19th century James Bond, he carries an arsenal of advanced weaponry (i.e., a crossbow that shoots a rapid-fire succession of arrows), all devised by his own `Q', a bookish friar named Carl who also serves as his sidekick. When first we meet Van Helsing, he is confronting the belligerent and murderous Mr. Edward Hyde, a bellicose, cigar-smoking giant, who has completely taken over the body of the kindly Dr. Henry Jekyll.  The two battle inside a French cathedral (it's not clear if it is Notre Dame), with the end result being Hyde/Jekyll killed, and a centuries old stained glass window shattered.  Such results are typical of this Van Helsing's battles, which has him in disfavor with his superiors in Vatican City, despite his success at curbing the world's monster population. Following his exploits in Paris, Van Helsing is sent to Transylvania, where it is learned Count Dracula is close to exterminating the Valeriouses, a wealthy family with close ties to the Vatican.  There, Van Helsing uncovers a plot by the Count and his fiendish brides to unleash thousands of vampires upon the world, brought to life through the electrical charge Dr. Frankenstein found in lightning and used to create his monster (the Count, in fact, needs the Monster to carry out his plan).  Standing in the Count's way, alongside Van Helsing, is the beautiful and resourceful Anna Valerious (Beckinsale) and her brother Velkan, who has been cursed as a werewolf. You see, in the story as devised by writer-director Stephen Sommers, a werewolf can kill a vampire, although they typically don't because they are usually under the vampire's power. This is the first time that Van Helsing, a character privy until now onlyto Dracula, has become involved with the big three, Dracula, Frankenstein's monster and the Wolfman.  He has a new first name; Gabriel, not Abraham. And, as personified by Jackman, he is far sexier than Van Sloan's myopic crusader, or Olivier's Dutch accent challenged vampire slayer.  Truth be told, Jackman's Van Helsing is far more warrior than professor, acrobatically waging war against the Count and his minions, while leaving to others the deciphering of any riddles connected to Dracula's scheme.  This Van Helsing is a man of action, not the mind, a major departure from the character as envisioned by Stoker. To give him a new look and history seems so apropos in this day and age of `extreme makeover', but, so much is accomplished through f/x and CG, there is a human element that is lost.  Sommers makes a vain attempt to humanize Van Helsing with a back story that makes his mission to destroy Dracula a personal one, but mostly, in Sommers vision, Van Helsing loses his connection to the audience, and instead becomes just another super-hero swallowed up by stunts.  Van Helsing is a fun thrill ride that carries a touch of nostalgia (specifically, a superb black and white salute to the Universal horror film of the 1930s), but which never reaches in to illuminate the soul of the character or cast a true shadow of horror on the audience.",Null,0,0,15 May 2004
Shrek 2," that rare sequel surpassing the original
","You can count on one hand the number of movie sequels that surpass the original.  One of those is without a doubt the latest installment in the misadventures of everyone's favorite grumpy green ogre, Shrek 2.  Here, the screenwriters have opted for a more mainstream storyline that adheres to the same theme explored in the first film, that being acceptance of self despite outward appearance.  This time, however, the script departs considerably from the gross-out humor of Shrek (crucial to establishing the essence of the big guy's character), while upping the quotient of pop cultures in-jokes and references, to create a side-splitting comedy appealing to both young and old alike. 	Shrek 2 picks up with Shrek (Mike Myers) and Fiona (Cameron Diaz) arriving home after their honeymoon, to be greeted by a royal welcoming committee sent by Fiona's parents, the King and Queen of Far, Far Away (John Cleese and Julie Andrews, respectively).  The happy couple is invited to a gala ceremony, celebrating their nuptials, back at Mom and Dad's castle.  What Mom and Dad don't know, though, is their little girl isn't married to Prince Charming, who arrived mere minutes too late at the dragon's castle from which Shrek rescued Fiona in the original. See, Charming (who is anything but) was supposed to kiss the lovely lass to break the curse that turned her into an ogre at night.  Then, the two would be married and live happily ever after in Far, Far Away.  Shrek's rescue of Fiona, and her subsequent falling in love with him, has ruined the plans of Charming (Rupert Everett), his mommy Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) and the King. 	Shrek 2 introduces some new/old characters, culled from the annals of the world's great fairy tales, none more satisfying than a swashbuckling Puss in Boots.  To do away with his unsightly new son-in-law, the King enlists the services of the overly-dramatic, highly-theatrical, plumed hat-sporting and rapier-wielding feline, voiced in an inspired piece of casting by Antonio Banderas, doing his own spin on his own performance in The Mask of Zorro. 	Directors Andrew Adamson and Kelly Asbury keep both the action and comedy quotients high, relying in the latter case more on the personalities of supporting characters over his leads, Myers' Shrek, Diaz's Fiona and Eddie Murphy's Donkey (although Murphy is hard to keep in check as he returns in top form, playing the relentlessly annoying jack-ass).  John Cleese is a stitch as the overbearing ruler who turns obsequious accomplice when confronted with the wrath of Fairy Godmother.  As Fairy Godmother, Jennifer Saunders brings just the right amount of acerbic duplicity she uses to such great effect in the superior British adult comedy import, Absolutely Fabulous. 	The abundance of pop culture references keep everyone satisfied, child and adult.  Shrek 2's script sends up everything from Joan Rivers' incessant red carpet blather at Hollywood premiers courtesy of the E! Channel to films like Mission: Impossible and Flashdance, and there's a terrific parody of the hit reality TV series Cops, called Knights. 	Shrek 2 is a welcome arrival to herald the onslaught of movies that make up the summer slate.  Everything that is about to come in its wake, is already way behind in the game.
