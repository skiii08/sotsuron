Raiders of the Lost Ark," Raiders of the Lost Ark movie about good vs evil
","'Raiders of the Lost Ark' follows Dr. Henry 'Indiana' Jones, an archaeologist, played by Harrison Ford in his quest for relics or hidden treasure. Jones adventures in the movie are extensive. We see him in the jungles of South America, a college class room, Nepal, Egypt, and a secret Nazi controlled island. There is a fellow archaeologist Dr. Rene Belloq or Belloq played by Paul Freeman, who is Jones enemy. Belloq and Jones race to find the Ark of the Covenant. Belloq enlist the help of the Nazis. Jones enlists the help of Marion Ravenwood played by Karen Allen, who is an ex-girlfriend. Jones also enlist the help of a friend Sallah played by John Rhys-Davies. Belloq and the Nazis plan to use the Ark for evil and world domination. Jones, Marion, And Sallah are out to stop Belloq and the Nazis. The theme of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is good vs. evil. Jones, Marion, and Sallah play the role of the good guys while Belloq and the Nazis are the bad guys. Bellog role as evil or bad guy is reinforced by his willingness to stop at nothing to get what he wants, the statue, the ark, and Marion. Once the mention of the Nazi army and Hitler are mentioned we know they are the bad guys. This is based symbolism Nazis and Hitler. These words automatically invoke the thought of evil. Belloq and the Nazis are searching for the ark to use its power to rule the world. There is a line in the movie 'No army that carried the ark has ever been defeated in battle.' (Spielberg, 1981) 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' uses sound to enhance the theme and settings. During action scenes in the movie when Jones is about to do something exceptional we here the same musical score. This score has become symbolic away from the movie and has been used in many situations in TV and film to stir the same feeling in the audience. The movie also uses a visible and invisible sound. An example of invisible sounds is in in Nepal when Marion is introduced. We here the wind blowing outside and this gives the impression of a blizzard outside. The best example of visible sound is when Marion and Jones are trying to escape the pit before the torches run out. We see Jones pushing a stone statue over to break down a wall. We here the grinding of stone and it give us an impression of a heavy stone statue. When in reality it was a prop make of fiberglass, wood, and wire. **Spoiler Alert**At the end of the movie when the Belloq convinces the Nazis to open the ark before taking it to Berlin shows the Belloq's greediness for power. When the ark is open at first we are lead to believe that nothing is in the ark. However, when things start to flow out of the ark and swirl around. We find the contents are mystical. Jones realizes what is happening and tells Marion to close her eyes. The Nazis and Belloq are destroyed by God for their arrogance and pride. Marion and Jones are able to survive because they were humbled.",10,0,1,28 July 2012
