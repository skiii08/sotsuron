Captain Phillips," Solid, but not exceptional.
","Relatively solid thriller. Manages to successfully keep the tension high for most of its (unnecessary) length. Nothing really to write home about though honestly. The performances are quite solid across the board but I didn't find them as compelling as a lot of critics seemed to. The biggest success of the movie is the portrayal of the pirate characters - they're actually (for the most part) pretty nuanced and there is noticeable effort to flesh them out. You really find yourself sympathizing with them at certain points, which is a definite accomplishment and adds some depth to the movie. This isn't essential viewing but if you decide to spend two hours with it you'll most likely walk away satisfied.",6,1,3,2 November 2013
Hereditary," Showcases what horror is capable of when taken seriously
","In many ways, Hereditary is the horror movie I've been restlessly waiting to see for so many years. Despite my avid fandom for the genre, I really feel that modern horror has lost its grasp on how to make a film that's truly unsettling in the way the great classic horror films are. A modern wide-release horror film is often nothing more than a conveyor belt of jump scares strung together with a derivative story which exists purely as a vehicle to deliver those jump scares. They're more carnival rides than they are films, and audiences have been conditioned to view and judge them through that lens. The modern horror fan goes to their local theater and parts with their money on the expectation that their selected horror film will 'deliver the goods', so to speak: startle them a sufficient number of times (scaling appropriately with the film's runtime, of course) and give them the money shots (blood, gore, graphic murders, well-lit and up-close views of the applicable CGI monster etc.) If a horror movie fails to deliver those goods, it's scoffed at and falls into the 'worst film I've ever seen' category. I put that in quotes because a disgruntled filmgoer behind me broadcasted those exact words across the theater as the credits for this film rolled. He really wanted us to know his thoughts.Like similarly fantastic and crowd-displeasing horror films of the past few years, The Witch and It Comes At Night, Hereditary is a film that largely deals in atmosphere and emotional horror. The Shining, which happens to be my favorite horror film, is a clear touchstone and I would go as far as saying that this is the first modern horror film I've seen that genuinely captures a similar tone and ethos. Much like that film, it delivers its horror through an intensifying sense of unease and dread that becomes nearly suffocating by its conclusion. Rather than startling you with cheap scares, it offers haunting and upsetting images which are often delivered without any of those overused sonic jolts. Perhaps most importantly, it anchors everything in an emotional core with nuanced characters who experience relatable family struggles and grief. And that is absolutely critical to what makes the movie effective and resonant: it works on a metaphorical level, using the supernatural story as a vehicle to explore the very real way in which a family can be absolutely ravaged by tragedy, and furthermore how trauma and mental illness are passed through the generations. I'd be remiss not to mention that Toni Collette gives a mesmerizing performance in this film that is absolutely unhinged and truly difficult to stomach at times.For all that praise and as excellent as I think it is, Hereditary isn't quite a masterpiece. Despite the fact that I was very much invested and riveted throughout the length of the film, there were some detectable pacing issues. I feel conflicted in saying that because I'm very much a fan of the slow-burn horror style which benefits from a deliberate pace, but I did get the occasional nagging sense that things could've been tightened up just a tad without losing the effect. Some of the scares in the film, often the more 'traditional' horror moments, also struck slightly the wrong note with me on a first viewing and were just a hair too campy or on-the-nose given how visionary and restrained the majority of the film is. And in its ending few minutes, the film really shows its full hand when a bit more ambiguity may have served it better.The positives far, far outweigh the negatives here though and Hereditary is ultimately a remarkable debut horror film which showcases what the genre is capable of when it's taken seriously by a talented director. Here's hoping we'll continue to see more like it.Light 4.5/5",9,935,1322,9 June 2018
Rocketman," Strong 2.5 // Breathing Room
","I'm no expert on Elton John, but in learning what I have about him through this film I've come to realize that two hours really just doesn't cut it. To do a story like his justice you need time, time to develop his character, sculpt the family dynamics, probe the internal and external conflicts, and, most importantly, time for the audience to digest such a meteoric rise and devastating fall. There's so much ground to cover and so many moments to address that the film feels like a highlight reel rather than the character portrait it seems to be striving for. Friendships, relationships, and conflicts are introduced and left behind at a speed that ultimately distanced me. It's not without its charms, though. There are some resonant tunes and flashy setpieces that manage to entertain, though other musical numbers fall decidedly flat with somewhat sluggish camerawork. It'd be interesting to see what a more visionary director like Damien Chazelle could've done with the material. As is, it's a mildly pleasant experience with a strong central performance that does a lot to carry the weight. The compact narrative just really lacked the breathing room it needed to resonate.Strong 2.5/5",5,0,1,11 August 2019
Gravity," Beautifully Hollow.
","Film critics need to stop name-dropping 2001: A Space Odyssey. Seriously, enough. There's no quicker way of piquing my interest, and no better way of ensuring my disappointment. Don't get me wrong here. Gravity is a decent movie. It can be quite arresting in its best moments, remains visually stunning throughout, and is reasonably entertaining for most of its duration. You could certainly do a hell of a lot worse for the price of admission these days. But despite its considerable strengths, none of them amount to a truly great film worthy of the absolute universal acclaim it has garnered.I'm not going to devote a whole lot of effort into explaining the strengths of the movie because they've basically been enumerated by nearly every single critical review on the internet. Yes, this is an undoubtedly gorgeous film. The visual fidelity is really something to behold, especially during scenes depicting space station destruction. The particle effects are definitely the most eye-popping I've ever seen. What's even more impressive than the visual effects though is the truly free-form, highly original camera-work and cinematography. The vast majority of the movie is shot with lengthy, tightly choreographed yet completely unhinged floating camera pans that are dizzyingly complex. The camera-work is really the most resounding success of the film as it completely creates that feeling of weightlessness and spatial disorientation that the characters are feeling and transmits all of that directly to the viewer.So yes, Gravity is certainly a spectacle and a visual feast, but honestly that's where the good things I have to say about it end. Thematically, this movie is essentially barren. All that's really at its heart is a half-baked attempt at reversing a traumatic, potentially damaging experience into a moment of rebirth, reinvigoration, and self- actualization. It's not even an original idea to begin with, but this isn't a particularly compelling rendition and the characters are at fault. This has got to be some of the most bland, undercooked characterization I've ever seen in a film with such positive reviews. After spending a full hour and a half with Bullock's character, all I feel I've really learned about her is that she's pretty damn efficient at taking on and off a space suit. Oh, and she has a pretty impressive lung capacity. I'm obviously exaggerating a bit- there's a very vague back-story involving the death of her daughter which gives us some perspective into her decidedly withdrawn and, frankly, boring demeanor. But it just isn't substantial enough to make her intriguing as a character and makes it very difficult to really buy into her transformation at the end of the movie. What's frustrating to me too is the fact that a lot of these issues could've been resolved with a little more exposition. This isn't a long movie at all. It easily could've been 30 minutes longer without even the remote danger of being bloated. Just 30 extra minutes of scenes devoted to characterization could've done wonders for the film and really gave it some weight and emotional resonance. Bullock's breakdown scene in the fuel-less escape pod is the perfect glimpse into the movie this could've been. It's by far the best scene in the movie and the only time where I was truly absorbed in the story rather than just admiring the pretty visuals. In this moment, Bullock's character shows a moment of complete vulnerability as she realizes the bleakness of her situation. She is completely alone, both in the overtly obvious physical sense but also in an emotional sense as well. This is such brilliant moment because it takes the character's emotional isolation since the death of her daughter and weaves it directly into her current physical isolation, creating a nice metaphor that instantly breathes life into the movie and gives it a sense of purpose. The character has essentially been drifting in this dead escape pod ever since her daughter died, and it isn't until this moment that she has finally come to terms with it. This moment is just as fleeting as it is powerful though, and it comes off as too little too late at this point. I do have some other more minor quibbles with different scenes in the movie that I thought were handled poorly as well. Early on in the film there's a nice moment where Clooney's character says something to the effect of 'nothing beats the view' and the camera pans over Earth with some really nice ambient music that kicks in. But as it re-circles back to Clooney the music fades to complete silence a little abruptly and the transition into more dialogue feels awkward. There's also a particularly hokey moment where Bullock's character verbally compares her flight in the escape pod to the times where she would 'just drive' after her daughter's accident. It comes off as a very forced attempt to integrate the relatively useless back-story into the present moment and just ends up being cringe-worthy. There's definitely more moments like this too- Bullock's howling along with the dog on the radio transmission or the corny, triumphant line of dialogue towards the end where she essentially announces something to the effect of 'well, whether I live or die this has been a hell of a ride!' I realize these are relatively petty criticisms but the film stumbles like this enough for it to take me out of the moment and detrimentally affect the viewing experience.At the end of the day though, this isn't an awful movie. It offers up some very compelling set pieces, unbelievable visuals, and some truly phenomenal camera-work that alone makes it worth the 10 bucks. But it's also a film that is ultimately very hollow, essentially devoid of compelling characters, and severely lacking in substance. Yes, it provides the superficial thrills and the eye candy. But for a film with so many accolades, it really leaves a lot to be desired.",5,1,3,2 November 2013
Darkest Hour," Mileage may vary based on your WWII knowledge
","I feel a bit unqualified to offer a review of this. So much of the film depended on the viewer having some prerequisite knowledge about Winston Churchill and the politics of World War II, and my lack thereof played heavily into my lukewarm reaction. And that's my main criticism of the film - as someone who doesn't have an in-depth knowledge of the events portrayed here, it didn't do enough to establish the character of Winston Churchill and help me understand his plight. I spent the majority of the film feeling as though I was passively watching the events unfold, mildly interested at best. It probably doesn't help that political intrigue films tend not to be my cup of tea. In any event, the film certainly looked nice and I absolutely admired and enjoyed Gary Oldman's performance. I'll add it to my list of films that came off as objectively good but just didn't appeal to me much.Light 3/5",6,0,3,26 February 2018
The Hunger Games," Fantastic concept, lackluster execution.
","The Hunger Games is a movie about the authoritarian rule of a corrupt government that sponsors an annual reality-TV death-match between innocent kids. Sounds horrific right? Repulsive? Inhuman? You'd think so. Yet the only horror here is that the film plays out like a shallow, run-of-the-mill Hollywood blockbuster complete with an obligatory love plot and green screens galore. Seriously, talk about wasted potential. The source material is definitely there. The themes take nods from classics like George Orwell's 1984, William Golding's Lord of the Flies, and Kurt Vonnegut's Harrison Bergeron, laying the groundwork for a film that could've been a deep, disturbing philosophical examination of human nature and the dangers of government. I'm honestly upset that I didn't read the novel before seeing the film. In the hands of a capable and talented director, I truly feel that this story could've made for a fantastically effective, provocative film. This is what ultimately makes the end result so frustrating to watch. It's basically like gearing up to lift an 800 lb dumbbell only to have your arms swing effortlessly upward as you realize the weights are made of Styrofoam. What should've been an excruciatingly weighty, stimulating affair ended up being about as heavy as a dollop of whipped cream, and just as sweet. And that is true hypocrisy of the film as well: we're supposed to be condemning of government and the characters that put on the Hunger Games, and yet the film itself falls into the same category of glamorizing and diluting what should be portrayed as an atrocity. The action is stylized, the grit and violence is subdued, the CG-sheen is blinding, and the love plot is ham-fisted. The true meat of this story, the implications of such a horrific form of entertainment and the underlying themes of how it could've come to be, are almost swept completely under the rug.And don't get me wrong here. I'm not just condemning this movie because it wasn't what I thought it should've been. I love stylized action and I there's nothing wrong with an entertaining blockbuster. But the problem is this movie fails on that level as well. The action sequences are uninspired and just plain boring, which is probably a consequence of the fact that the movie never worked to make me emotionally invested. How can I possibly care about these kids fighting for their lives when 90% of them don't have more than four lines in the film and are portrayed as one-dimensional villains? To me, the majority of these characters were as expendable as they were to the citizens of the Capitol. They ended up feeling more like willing, eager participants than desperate, victimized innocents. The bottom line here is a movie that could've been a deep, provocative, disturbing look at human nature ending up being a shallow Hollywood affair that barely scratched the surface of the underlying themes of its source material. The movie simply felt as manufactured as the Hunger Games themselves, directly catering to the audience rather than challenging it. If you like your government-sponsored child death- matches sugarcoated and served with a large bag of buttery popcorn, by all means. If you're looking for a film willing to dig a little deeper, search elsewhere.",4,5,7,2 November 2013
12 Angry Men," A film so good, you'll feel like you've gained insight into life and humanity
","12 Angry Men is a film that's so good and so powerful that, as the credits roll, you actually feel like you've gained a deeper understanding of humanity, our justice system, and life in general. I mean it. It's really that good. Twelve jurors of varying ages, personalities, cultural backgrounds and social standings enter a deliberation room to determine the guilt or innocence of a troubled teenage boy accused of murdering his father. It's quite a simple premise – a jury's deliberation – one that occurs daily all over the United States. But the film manages to wring every last drop of tension, drama, and social commentary from this commonplace scenario that it's impossible not to viscerally experience the true weight and implications of such a task – to search for the truth in a case of life and death.First things first: let's just appreciate how entertaining 12 Angry Men is. This is a film that takes place entirely in a single room, and tells its story completely through dialogue. And yet, it manages to be significantly more absorbing and enthralling than your average film with dozens of different locations and set pieces. The dialogue is so well-written and the characters so well-realized (and acted) that you become completely swept up in the proceedings. The pacing is also pitch perfect. The film rises naturally to a few emotional climaxes and confrontations, which are punctuated by quieter moments as the characters (and we as the audience) catch our breaths and process what has developed. And for a film that takes place entirely in such a confined space, there are a pretty incredible number of interestingly-composed sequences and long takes as the camera maneuvers from character to character and the drama unfolds. So yes, 12 Angry Men is a superbly entertaining film that absolutely flies by over the course of its brief hour-and-a-half running time. But it's also so much more than that. It's a film about 'truth': its elusiveness, malleability, and vulnerability to the subjectivity of the human mind. Yes, there is a single objective truth to this, and likewise any real-life case; but the jurors don't know it, and neither do we. The objective truth isn't the point. The point is the impressionability of the 'truth' – how it morphs in the minds of the characters (and in ours) over the course of the film, and how significantly it can be informed by our emotions, past experiences, memory (and its limitations), prejudices, and a myriad of other factors. The film is able to crystallize both the beauty and the folly of our judicial system. The beauty, as Henry Fonda's character points out, is that the scales are heavily tipped in favor of the innocent, that no man can be found guilty unless that guilt is beyond any reasonable doubt. The folly? The subjectivity of reasonable doubt, and the unavoidable reliance on a human jury who are influenced by all of the aforementioned factors.But ultimately, 12 Angry Man a film about us – people. Each juror in the film has a unique personality, temperament, and background which informs his opinion and motivates the role he plays in the story. Every juror gets his time to shine and the result is an ensemble that feels both diverse and extremely well- balanced.The strength of the characters in the film and the way they play off of one another is key to perhaps its most important theme: the danger of assumption, and the ease and quickness with which we judge one another. We watch as the jurors expose their biases and prejudices through their assumptions and judgments of the defendant, as well as one another. But even beyond that, the true brilliance of the film is that it subtly provokes the exact same snap-judgments from us as we watch. It's extremely easy to start to view the more critical jurors as the 'good guys' and the dissenting, guilty-proponent jurors as the 'bad guys.' To invoke a psychiatric concept, we engage in splitting – seeing some of the jurors as 'all good' and others as 'all bad.' We automatically begin to judge the seemingly more prejudiced and willful jurors, confining them to a box of our construction without knowing barely anything about them.But in its revealing final moments, the film snaps us back and urges us to look beneath the surface of those who we judge and ask an important question: why? Why does one juror spew prejudice and anger while another sits silently? What drives them to act in the way that they do? No one is born prejudiced, bigoted or racist. These are things we learn and which become incorporated into our personalities often through no fault of our own. The angry, prejudiced juror isn't inherently 'all bad,' but simply reacts in a way that is informed by his accumulated life experience (much of which is subconscious). Of course, that doesn't mean that people can't and shouldn't be held accountable for their negative attributes and beliefs – we can always introspect and take action to improve our worst qualities. But that isn't the point. The film simply asserts that we should strive to understand before we judge, as understanding and empathy fosters connection where judgment simply divides. As Juror #3 – who we've likely judged and grown to despise throughout the film – weeps over the torn photograph of himself and his estranged son at the conclusion of the film, the message couldn't be clearer.12 Angry Men is a masterpiece. It is a film that marvelously succeeds on all the facets that every great film should. It's fabulously entertaining and engrossing, fantastically shot and acted, perfectly paced, and extremely thought-provoking. An undeniable classic whose themes will never lose their relevance.",10,1,3,17 May 2016
Us," Solid 3.5 // Peele steps up his visual craft
","Jordan Peele doubles down on his 'social horror' premise and manages to considerably expand his craft, though without entirely avoiding the pitfalls of Get Out, his lauded debut. Us is once again built on a clever concept designed to mine the horror from a particular American social tension - this time, class. Peele goes even more off-the-wall with the premise here and, for a mainstream horror film, I admire the degree to which he revels in its outlandishness. The visuals are more unique, striking, and even haunting at their best. It's clear that he spent a lot of effort cultivating a singular iconography for the film and that's probably its greatest success, as many of its images linger. And the social metaphor at the film's heart, while not subtle by any stretch, is a crucial element as it gives the proceedings a sense of weight and purpose, both of which are severely lacking in so many throw-away modern horror films.It's a bit of a shame, though, that Peele waits until the very final sequences of the film to open things up and delve more fully into the themes. He constructs great opening and closing acts (including the fantastically creepy prologue), but the middle section sags with what's essentially an extended cat-and-mouse sequence that feels too drawn-out. Additionally, though it is less of an issue here than with Get Out, I still struggle with a sense of tonal muddiness. Horror and comedy have certainly been blended to great effect in the past, but something about the execution here bugs me. Peele's making quite a provocative and even experimental horror film here with heavy social commentary and heady themes, but simultaneously seems to undermine himself with occasional shots of low-brow humor seemingly to make the film more palatable. Perhaps it's just my personal taste, but I'd love to see him fully commit to the horror tone in the future; he clearly has the talent to make something truly harrowing.Solid 3.5/5",7,0,0,7 April 2019
Knives Out," Solid 3.5 // Shines brightest when focused on the ensemble
","An entertaining murder mystery with a colorful cast and playful energy. The first half or so is particularly strong and layers on the plot twists at a satisfying clip. The film is at its strongest when the ensemble convenes and the characters are able to play off of one another. As the plot progresses though, there is increasingly less opportunity for this and the film narrows its focus to only a few characters for a significant portion of the run time. It loses some of its charm in the process and the double, triple, and quadruple plot reversals start to feel shallow when the humanity of the characters has taken a back seat. I also didn't care so much for the forced political commentary, not because it wasn't an interesting angle to take but rather the execution just felt a bit too obvious and preachy. An enjoyable and lighthearted film on the whole, but it didn't resonate far beyond that.Solid 3.5/5",7,1,4,7 December 2019
The Irishman," Strong 3.5 // An ruminative exploration of aging and loss
","Another notch in the belt for Martin Scorsese. It's a restrained and surprisingly somber affair that primarily explores the process of aging and loss - loss of family, friends, vitality, and era. At 3.5 hours the deliberate pacing and ruminative tone become a bit of a challenge, though the length is instrumental in truly exploring these themes and achieving the impact of the final act. If you've seen mafia films before there are some familiar beats here, though the acting and Scorsese's execution are so top-notch that the familiarity doesn't detract from the experience. It's not the most exciting film in his cannon and it's unlikely to become a personal favorite, though it's always a pleasure to spend a few hours absorbed in an experience so richly crafted.Strong 3.5/5",7,2,3,25 December 2019
My Neighbor Totoro," 'I could see them too, when I was young.'
","Everything is magical when you're a child. A gust of wind over a grassy meadow, a giant conifer reaching to the sky, tadpoles swirling in a puddle, a brand new house to run through and explore. Life is new, exciting, and mysterious.My Neighbor Totoro is a film that perfectly captures the wonder and beauty of life as seen through the eyes of a child. This is Hayao Miyazaki at his most restrained. In the broad scheme of his filmography, it is a distillation of everything that makes his work so effective and beloved: stunningly authentic character animation brimming with personality, gorgeously detailed settings and landscapes, and an ability to capture the magic in the small, inconsequential moments of life. We follow Satsuki and Mei, two young sisters who have moved with their father to a new house in an idyllic rural village. It is soon revealed that the purpose of this move is to be closer to their chronically ill mother who is staying in a nearby hospital - a detail which gains significant weight with the knowledge that Miyazaki's own mother spent a lot of time in the hospital with tuberculosis when he was a child. Although their mother's illness does loom over the film and is a crucial grounding element, it is relatively distant and far from its focal point. Instead, the meat of the film is simply Satuski and Mei exploring their new home and surroundings, assimilating to life in a new town, and, of course, meeting Totoro and friends. Totoro and his companions are the 'spirits of the forest', as the girls' father puts it. He can't see them, nor can any of the adults in the film. For Mei and Satsuki, though, they are very much alive and real. Totoro acts as a personification of the aforementioned magic of nature and life. He's what makes acorns sprout into trees and propels the wind over the plains. Of course Mei and Satsuki can see him - for them, the wonder and awe of life is still fresh and exhilarating. And even though their father may not physically see these creatures as he works by candle light amidst a mess of papers and books, he seems to remember a time when he did. He nurtures the wonderment that his daughters feel and vicariously experiences it through them, as do we.All Miyzaki films have an environmental theme and display a fond respect for nature; here, it's reverential. Wind rushes over the grassy farmland, butterflies flutter in and out of frame, a snail inches slowly up the stem of a flower, a toad crawls along a dirt road in the middle of a rainstorm, a fish bobs to the surface of a pond setting small ripples in motion which radiate away. Miyazaki hangs over each of these moments and makes it impossible not to experience their simple beauty as the girls do.This is the essence of My Neighbor Totoro. It's a simple, humble, and reflective film free of sensory excess, antagonists, or even a traditional plot. It merely sets out to magnify and bask in the magic of life which becomes all too muted as you age. 'I could see them too, when I was young', states a warm, elderly neighbor of the girls. With this film, you might yet again.",9,0,1,15 May 2016
Ready Player One," Imaginative and fun, though lacks an emotional core
","In the grand scheme of blockbuster filmmaking, you could definitely do worse than Ready Player One. It boasts plenty of style, imagination, and dazzling visuals and Spielberg lends his experienced hand to stitch everything together in kinetic fashion. It's worth a recommendation on the strength of its best set pieces and its sheer exuberance. On the other hand, the movie also feels somewhat ungrounded and overblown. Its glaring issue is that the characters largely fail to anchor the movie and give it the emotional core that it needs. They're serviceable, but lacking in depth nearly across the board and the lead, in particular, does not carry the film too well. It also suffers a bit from the Speilberg schmaltz factor, mainly in its resolution. Still, it's a fun, mostly well-directed film that stands out in a sea of generic blockbusters.3.5/5",7,1,3,14 April 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Strong 4 // Goes down easy but sits in the stomach like a rock
","A genuinely disturbing exploration of racism in America disguised as buddy cop comedy. Don't let the trailers fool you, this is a fiercely political film that does not shy away from the horror of its central theme. And though I squirmed many more times than I laughed, BlacKkKlansman manages to entertain as much as it unsettles. Spike Lee smartly chose 70's blaxploitation as the framework for the film which enabled him to inject some levity into a subject that could've otherwise been harrowing and indigestible. With that framework, he has crafted a film which is equally playful and disquieting, one which is able to joke about the absurdity of racism in America all while impressing upon the viewer how far from a joke this really is. Some may call the ending cheap and sensationalist, but it undeniably pulls the rug out and forces you to simmer in the harshness of reality. It's a film that goes down easy only to linger in your stomach like a rock.Strong 4/5",8,10,20,19 August 2018
Climax," Weak 3.5 // Mostly succeeds as viscera
","As an exercise in pure viscera, French provocateur Gaspar Noé mostly pleases with Climax. A group of dancers unknowingly drink spiked sangria which slowly warps their afterparty into an LSD-soaked nightmare. With a premise like that, it may be evident that this is a film meant to be experienced rather than thought about. The pleasures of Climax come nearly entirely from its sheer audiovisual power: the ceaselessly pulsating score, the fluid one-shot takes, the lurid colors. It's closer to performance art than what most people would characterize as a 'movie' and should be approached with that mindset if you're to enjoy it. However, as enjoyable as its best sequences are, the lack of nearly any thematic depth imbues much of the film with a subtly nagging tediousness. And even when viewed purely from an experiential perspective, it is far from watertight in its pacing and flow. Still, there is a cumulative power in its sound, visuals, and theatrics that's hard to deny.Weak 3.5/5",7,25,38,6 April 2019
The Favourite," Strong 4 // Lanthimos' strongest yet
","It's a bit mystifying that a director as uncompromisingly weird as Yorgos Lanthimos has broken this far into the mainstream. Mystifying, and wonderful, of course. He's a filmmaker with a unique voice, strong creative vision, and, most importantly, the talent to fully realize that vision on screen. Look no further than his first two compellingly bizarre English language films, The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer, for convincing evidence of this.The Favourite is his strongest work yet. It's every bit as offbeat, darkly comedic, and unflinching as his past work but manages to be a tad more accessible, too. His typical comedically stilted and deadpan characters have been swapped for those with decidedly more... color. The emotional hysterics, conniving antics, and general bad behavior of the supposedly high-class characters here set against the pomp-and-circumstance backdrop give the film its beating comedic heart.And what a backdrop it is. If for nothing else, see this film for its wonderfully over-the-top performances and gorgeous visual presentation. The castle and its grounds are stunning and Lanthimos frames it all with beautiful panoramic shots, natural lighting, and surprisingly well-utilized fisheye lenses. The camerawork is highly dynamic with lots of fast pans and tracking shots that truly capture the scale and space of the castle. And all three leads, as well as Nicholas Hoult in the supporting role, bring these despicable characters to life and lend so much to the entertainment value of the film in their performances.The story here of opportunism, selfishness, and climbing the social ladder via nefarious methods is certainly something we've seen before, but the irreverent execution and transgressive love triangle at its center add more than enough freshness. It's certainly a timely story as well given the chaotic state of the White House over the past two years and had me reflecting quite a bit on how frighteningly close art can mirror reality.And while not exactly a crowd-pleaser, the unexpectedly haunting and surrealistic closing moments really struck me. It's one of those endings that catches you off guard, imbalances you, and forces you to think back over the events of the film and the themes therein. What has Emma Stone's character achieved? Where has she left to go? It does an excellent job of grounding the film and bringing its melancholy tones up from below the surface.My only major complaint is with the pacing and structure. The first 45 minutes or so are absolutely fantastic with every scene feeling vibrant and vital. The tension simmers and bubbles between Stone and Weisz's characters and their interactions give the film its backbone and narrative thrust. However, as a consequence of certain plot progressions in its latter half which I won't detail, this tension fizzles and with it the thrust. The film takes on a somewhat plodding quality and there is an air of anticlimax as we never really get a satisfying catharsis from the rivalry.It was a notable issue for me, at least on first viewing, but it wasn't enough to significantly dampen the overall experience. And furthermore, I'm nothing but excited that an auteur like Lanthimos is getting as much exposure as he is, especially given his challenging and provocative style. It's exactly what I wish we had more of in the mainstream and gives me hope that future envelope-pushing directors can find their platform too.Strong 4/5",8,3,6,6 January 2019

It's intoxicating, and the nearly three-hour run time simply melts away under his assured directorial hand. But there's something more here, too: a yearning for a bygone era, a melancholic rumination on the ever-changing times, and the reflections of an iconic director approaching the twilight of his own storied career. Tarantino seems to be exploring the very fabric of stories themselves and their roles in our lives, be it the story Rick Dalton tells himself about his own career, Robbie's Tate relishing herself on the big screen, or we as the audience viewing this very film's revisionist, fairy-tale denouement. Through story we can hope, dream, grieve, play, contemplate, yearn, process the unfathomable, and just have a good time. Thanks for the good time, Quentin.Solid 4.5/5",9,11,18,4 August 2019
A Quiet Place," Mildly entertaining, though unremarkable
","Wish I could get behind this as much as everyone else. It's decent. The creatures are relatively cool looking, some of the lighting and set design is nice, and most of all it was enjoyable to see a mainstream film commit to being so quiet for so much of its runtime. The movie also does a relatively good job of making the vulnerability of these characters and the fragility of their safety feel palpable. Beyond this though, I was very much underwhelmed by the final product. I understand the metaphorical layer the film is going for - the idea of sacrificing everything for your children and the insistent paranoia that surely goes along with being a parent. But the metaphor is just there. It isn't explored in any deeper or satisfying way. Perhaps it would've resonated more if I were a parent myself, but as it stands I felt there just wasn't enough to chew on with the story here. And when you take away that metaphorical level, the movie that remains is ultimately just a very traditional cat-and-mouse creature film with plenty of loud, easily foreseeable and mundane jump scares. Yes, as quiet as the film often is, it still very much relies on those piercingly loud jolts for the bulk of its scares. I'll always prefer a horror film that can get under my skin; one that can disturb rather than startle me. And I also just had a nagging sense that the film lacked the directorial vision it really needed to help elevate the material above the basic premise. Fair, mildly entertaining, but derivative and ultimately forgettable.Light 3/5",6,4,8,20 April 2018
Call Me by Your Name," Words are futile devices
","It's difficult to articulate precisely what makes this film so phenomenal. It may sound cliché, but words truly can't capture its ravishing, almost magical quality. Few films are able to transport me so fully that I feel I'm there with the characters, experiencing each moment as if it's happening in real time. There is something so palpable about this film, like you can just reach out and touch it. The setting and mood are absolutely intoxicating to the point where you can almost feel the water through your hands and the sun on your face. Pinpointing how the film creates this effect is nearly impossible because it's really the combination of so many things: the colors, lighting, editing, music, pacing, and, of course, the incredible performances by its two leads. This is definitely a film that lives and breathes in the subtle details, which collectively create a feeling of richness and depth. Crucial as well is the film's masterful use of restraint in its patient, languid rhythm that perfectly captures the feeling of a lazy summer afternoon. Overall a beautiful, poignant love story that feels simultaneously intimate and overwhelming; blissful and melancholic. Destined to be a classic. Hell, it already feels like one.Decent 4.5/5",9,2,4,26 February 2018
1917," Solid 2.5 // Shallow Spectacle
","For better or worse, 1917 is a film in which seemingly all the creative energy was focused on its technical elements. The extremely long takes are impressive, the fluid shot compositions arresting, the sets beautifully realized and convincing. But once that initial sense of awe inevitably wanes, it becomes naggingly clear that the film has nothing to offer beyond its visual splendor. It plays like a theme park ride, stringing together setpieces that offer superficial thrills but ultimately fail to engage on any emotional or intellectual level. It appears to be going for a hyperrealistic, you-are-there experience but never comes close to capturing any real sense of chaos or pandemonium. Everything feels too tightly-controlled and manicured to translate as the real thing, especially with the conspicuous direction constantly drawing attention to itself. It doesn't help either that the film seems to have an inflated sense of self-importance, as if all the theatrics are in service to some grand commentary on humanity, friendship, life, and death. In reality, it's a popcorn film that fancies itself a fine work of art, ultimately lacking in any real thematic or emotional depth. That isn't necessarily a bad thing; if you're primarily looking for a visual spectacle you're likely to be satisfied. If that's the case, I'd even recommend it. I fully applaud the effort and skill it took to make, though wish I could say it was in service to something more than killing two hours nursing your calorie-dense snack of choice.Solid 2.5/5",5,23,56,12 January 2020
Grave of the Fireflies," Not an easy watch, but very thought-provoking and beautiful
","A stark and harrowing tale of orphaned teen Seita and his younger sister Setsuko as they try to survive on their own in war-torn Japan. Right from the start the film really pulls no punches in its depiction of the horrors of war. Images of air raids, burning homes, mass destruction, injured citizens and mounds of bodies are just a few of the searing images which present themselves within the first 30 minutes of the film. Interestingly though, there is a stillness to this first section of the film even in the midst of such horror. Not only is there very minimal music, there are many scenes with no sound at all save for the voices of the characters speaking. We don't hear the groans of the injured, the shuffle of the displaced townsfolk, or the crackles of the fires. It's an interesting decision which gives this opening section a very solemn and observant feel that forces the viewer to confront the emotional horror without dramatization or distraction.Beyond the shocking opening, the core of the film goes on to examine how the siblings cope with the death of their mother and loss of their home. At first, they take refuge in a paternal aunt's home who is less-than welcoming. A major theme of the film explored here is how the family unit and society is affected by war. There is a 'circling of the wagons' portrayed here where the immediate family is given precedence and the individual begins to fend for him/herself and becomes less willing to offer help to others. Even from the start Setsuko and Seita's aunt seems less than enthusiastic about letting her niece and nephew stay with her and her resentment only grows from there. The lack of food supplies and extra mouths to feed puts a strain on her and she begins to favor her own family over Setsuko and Seita. This theme repeats itself with the other townsfolk as well who are hesitant to share food even as Setsuko grows sick and malnourished. The bond between neighbors slowly dissolves and a sense of impersonality develops. We as the audience watch as these two children are essentially excommunicated from society and even who we would normally consider 'honorable' citizens like a police officer and doctor ultimately turn a blind eye to their suffering. The war itself is portrayed with a similar impersonality. We never see any of the soldiers fighting or hear any of their stores. We simply see these nameless, faceless airplanes flying thousands of feet overhead, dropping their bombs and flying on, unaware and uncaring of the suffering that directly results. It feels like a commentary on the depersonalization and dehumanization that must take place for such acts of violence to be carried out.The film also makes good use of its central firefly metaphor for a few very poignant scenes. From what I gathered, the fireflies in the film essential represent those lost to war; they are the silent remnants and glowing reminders of the departed. Keeping this in mind throughout the film gives many scenes an eerie quality. Setsuko and Seita are often seen surrounded by fireflies which essentially feel like harbingers of the death that will eventually befall them both. One scene in particular struck me: the two spend their first night in the converted bomb shelter after running away from their aunt and fill the space with fireflies to keep it lit. It's a beautiful scene on the surface, but with a very dark undertone. At this point, even before their deaths, Setsuko and Seita have left the land of the living and are already taking their place among the dead.Another particularly powerful scene directly follows. Setsuko reveals that she has been aware that their mother has died for some time now, a detail which Seita thought he had successfully kept secret from her. Upon hearing her speak these words, Seita breaks down into tears and this is the first time we see him truly emotionally react to the death of his mother. Up until this point he had shouldered the role of protector, keeping a straight face and trying to protect Setsuko from the horrors that have befallen them as much as possible. It is at this moment that he realizes how futile that action has been, as the war has already made its irreversible impact on Setsuko. At this moment, I feel he is crying not just for his mother, but also for the innocence that he knows his sister has lost despite his best efforts.Although it isn't an easy watch by any means, Grave of the Fireflies is a powerful statement on war and its devastating personal and societal impacts. It feels very fitting that Seita goes against the advice to cremate his younger sister in a church, instead opting for an open field. After being denied help and care from so many of his fellow citizens, he has recognized the grave societal change which has taken place and has all but abandoned tradition or custom. He chooses to grieve the loss of his sister (and himself) only among the fireflies.",8,1,2,18 April 2016
Evil Dead," An Anomalously Worthwhile Remake
","This remake was warranted. God, something about that phrase feels so blasphemous. It's definitely not something I'd ever expected to say after a film, but in this case it somehow feels appropriate. The original Evil Dead is obviously a seminal, classic horror film that can never be truly replicated. But it becomes apparent from the outset that this movie isn't attempting to reproduce what came before. It comes off more as an homage than anything else – a celebration of the first film in all of its ridiculousness and glorious excess. And although this remake doesn't manage to successfully capture the unique, fun-loving tone of the original, it certainly captures all of the ridiculousness and the excess. Oh the excess. As I mentioned before, I feel that this is one of those rare remakes that doesn't feel like a useless rehash with no purpose for existing other than to fill some wallets while emptying others. As great as the original film is, it's undeniably dated visually. And since so much of the entertainment of the movie hinges on the absurd levels of gore and all-around-nastiness, the dated visuals definitely hinder the film from being as effective today as it was when it was released. The remake fully rectifies this and then some. This has got to be one of the most visually impressive horror films ever made, especially considering there's barely a shred of CGI to be found. If this movie proves anything, it's that there's no real substitute for great make-up and prosthetics in horror. CGI can be a very tricky thing to pull off in this genre and it often ends up making things that were meant to look scary actually look goofy and artificial. I can wholeheartedly say that everything that is intended to appear scary in this movie definitely looks the part. As far as I'm concerned, this is the absolute best that possessed people have ever looked on screen. They'd be downright gorgeous if they weren't so repulsive. Sadly though, the rest of the movie doesn't quite live up to the stunning visuals. Although the lead actress gives a very strong performance, none of the other actors (or their characters) are nearly as compelling. Also, something about the pacing of the film felt a bit off to me. The divisions between the scenes where you knew something scary was about to happen and the 'safe' scenes where there was a lull in the action were a little too transparent. It was essentially always obvious when you should get ready for the next scare and when you could take a breather, which made the suspense of the film feel disjointed. Instead of slowly and relentlessly ratcheting up the tension like the original, the remake feels more like a string of self-contained gruesome scenes parceled up and divided by packing material. The tone of the film also feels a little conflicted. It definitely tries to take a more serious, straight-horror approach for much of its duration but additionally sprinkles in comedic elements reminiscent of the original. These two approaches don't complement each other that well and feel slightly at odds. Despite its shortcomings, Evil Dead is definitely an anomaly- it's a remake that's actually worth watching for fans of the original film. The inconsistent tone, limp characters and disjointed pacing hold it back from being an excellent film, but none of these pitfalls prevent the film from being a ton of fun and the make-up/effects are second to none. I had a great time watching it and I'd expect most fans of the original would as well.",7,3,5,3 November 2013
Cold War," Solid 4 // Epic in scope, short in length
","The trailer for Cold War suggests a languid, intimate romance set to a series of shuffling cool-jazz ballads. The film itself, however, delivers something much wider and surprisingly ambitious in scope. It's an epic, decades-spanning romance told in an incredibly tight hour-and-a-half. The passionate romance suggested by the trailer is certainly at the core, but layered around it are themes of obsession, disordered personality, art vs. politics, nationalism, classism, exploitation, and tyranny. The film accomplishes so much in such a short period of time that it's hard not to marvel at it, even if the break-neck pacing can be a bit emotionally distancing. Strip away the sociopolitical commentary and what you're left with is a powerful exploration of the pleasures and dangers of all-consuming love. See it for the unique structure, gorgeous cinematography, rich music, and thematic heft.Solid 4/5",8,1,3,9 February 2019
Midsommar," Solid 4 // Perverse Breakup Fantasy
","Given the speed with which Hereditary ascended to the company of my all-time horror favorites, Midsommar had a lot to live up to. Too much, perhaps. The weight of my expectations certainly burdened my initial viewing of the film as I hotly anticipated Aster's second helping of ratcheting tension, deepening dread, despairing tone, and delayed-gratification thrills. What I got instead was unexpected, though pleasantly so.Where Hereditary is unequivocally steeped in traditional horror iconography and tone, Midsommar is difficult to categorize as horror at all. Though it certainly has a few horrific sequences, the prevailing mood of the film is lighter with a significant emphasis on dark comedy. It plays more like a perverse fantasy in which Aster uses a folk-horror setup as a means to externalize the innermost wishes of our protagonist as she slowly comes to terms with the failure of her relationship. All the hallmarks of such a scenario - growing distance, infidelity, finding new friends, cutting the cord, retreating back to family (or in this case, discovering a new one) - are playfully heightened in absurdist and operatic rituals that wring the comedy, tragedy, horror, and catharsis from the familiar.Approaching the film on these terms is important if you're to fully appreciate it. It's just as technically brilliant and even more visually impressive than Hereditary, though lacks the immediate thrills you might expect from a follow-up. Where Hereditary is populated by numerous sharp, stand-out sequences that often result from unexpected plot turns, Midsommar operates more as a mood piece with far fewer moment-to-moment fireworks. Instead, it patiently accumulates and lands its impact in the final frames, prompting you to reflect on the clever construction of the film and retroactively unravel the subtext. At its best, the beautiful and bizarre visuals, languid pacing, and excellent score culminate in an intoxicating surrealism that's not easy to come by in modern movies.What I miss the most from Hereditary, though, is the richness of its characters. Despite the increasingly bizarre story developments, the humanity at the core of its subjects is ever-present and does so much to anchor the film and keep the viewer invested. By comparison, the characters in Midsommar feel decidedly thinner. The only real exception is Dani, who's brought impressively to life by Pugh, though even she feels ill-defined next to Collette's multilayered and devastating turn as Annie. The extra 30 minutes of the Director's Cut thankfully does quite a bit to flesh out the dimensions of the characters and smooth the pacing, ultimately heightening the impact of the ending. It's the definitive cut by a convincing margin, though still doesn't fully rectify the somewhat insubstantial quality of the characters. I can marvel at the technical prowess, admire the carefully-tuned pacing, soak in the thick atmosphere, and contemplate the themes, but I do so at a distance, never fully losing myself in the drama as I have with Hereditary.Still, Midsommar is a fine sophomore effort from Aster that boasts arresting visuals, bold direction, and a subtly surreal tone that sets it apart as a unique and memorable journey well-worth taking. Check your post-Hereditary expectations at the door and it will cast an intoxicating spell all its own.Solid 4/5",8,2,7,4 September 2019
Castle in the Sky," Introducing: Studio Ghibli
","The film that officially introduced the world to what would become the greatest animation studio of all time, and it lives up to that honor. All these years later in what now seems to be the twilight era of Studio Ghibli, classic after classic under their belts, Castle in the Sky still manages to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with its best. Hayao Miyazaki's intention with this film was to show off what the studio was capable of, as well as to act as its mission statement - to create animated features of the utmost quality filled with magic, heart, adventure, depth, and purity of artistic intent. It succeeds with flying colors.It's a notable film in Miyazaki's filmography not only for being his first under the Ghibli banner, but also in that it is perhaps his most traditional work during his time with the studio. It employs many classical storytelling techniques that he would later largely abandon as his voice as an auteur deepened: a solid three-act structure, the MacGuffin plot device, as well as a purely villainous antagonist. This was likely a conscious decision with the intent of laying a sturdy, accessible foundation upon which to build the studio's name, and it's by no means a criticism of the film. Quite the contrary, these tried-and-true techniques are employed in absolutely masterful fashion to create what is a clear contender for the studio's strongest and most narratively satisfying action/adventure film. It also lays the groundwork for what would become many of Ghibli's core themes: coming of age, friendship, awe of the natural world, and rich, morally layered characters who are often not all they may seem at first glance.Though it may not have quite the same level of experimentation, uniqueness, and artistic virtuosity as some of Miyazaki's later works, it remains one of his seminal films, as well as one of his most tightly-scripted, well-paced, and purely fun.

Psycho," Iconic and masterfully executed, though thematically slight
","Psycho is a perennial horror classic for good reason. Its best scenes are among the most iconic in the genre and remain potently suspenseful and visually arresting even if they aren't quite horrifying by today's standard. Going toe-to-toe with the 'scare' scenes are a couple of tense dialogue exchanges that are just as compelling thanks to Anthony Perkins' layered and chilling performance.The highs are incredibly high, perhaps to a fault. Connective tissue scenes in the film which have the misfortune of resting before and after some of the best moments in horror can feel a bit mundane by comparison. There is an unevenness that has become more pronounced with repeat viewings, as I find myself looking forward to the best moments rather than enjoying each on its own merit. It may be a consequence of the fact that this is a film that is somewhat heavily reliant on its mystery and eventual twist, with many moments dedicated specifically to throwing the audience off the scent. Once you've seen the movie, the tricks take on a transparency that betrays the slightly shallow nature of the story. The execution makes up for these shortcomings convincingly, but Hitchcock has certainly made other thrillers that are much richer thematically (Rear Window, Vertigo), and less reliant on a central gimmick.Regardless, Psycho absolutely shines in its best moments thanks to the excellent performances and Hitchcock's masterful direction. It certainly deserves its classic status in both Hitchcock's filmography and the horror catalog at large, even if it lacks the consistency and substance of some of his other classics.Strong 4/5",8,0,0,28 June 2018
Joker," Solid 4 // The only superhero movie I've enjoyed in a decade
","As an ardent decrier of all things superhero, this movie won me over. It manages to avoid almost all of the things that usually turn me off about the genre - the formulaic, committee-think constructions, the overwhelming test-screened safeness, the crowd appeasement, the vanilla-flavored tone. Instead, Joker establishes an absorbing atmosphere, one that was surprisingly nihilistic, grimy, and even genuinely unsettling. This is probably the closest a superhero franchise movie is ever going to come to an art-house style character study and it's pulled off quite convincingly. It isn't exactly subtle, and there are some hamfisted moments (the totally unnecessary flashbacks regarding the love interest jump to mind), but as a portrayal of a deeply disturbed individual cast off and exploited, the movie was able to generate real empathy and disgust. Much of the success is, of course, owed to the excellence of Joaquin Phoenix's performance which elevates the material. I was pleasantly surprised by how compromised and pitiful his character was written to be. Rather than rise up by some grand anarchist scheme, his notoriety happens almost entirely incidentally while his own actions are fueled by apolitical and often delusional motivations. The entire third act of the film could be viewed as a wish-fulfillment psychosis as the underbelly of the city rises fantastically around him, offering him the stage he's always dreamed of commanding. While likely either a flashback or a flashforward, the final scene also seems to subtly reinforce this suggestion of psychosis and adds a nice sprinkle of ambiguity. Even if you're a superhero skeptic, give this one a shot.Solid 4/5",8,1,2,12 October 2019
Parasite," Strong 4.5 // Well-oiled Machine
","Wow. A truly exceptional film that somehow lives up to the immense praise. It manages to be so many things at once: an operatic satire, a classist takedown, a cheeky comedy, a twisty thriller, a chilling horror, a somber rumination. Much of the success is owed to the absolutely phenomenal screenplay which is one of the most intricately constructed in recent memory. Every setup is paid off, every tonal shift deftly balanced, every progression carefully timed. The movie feels like a well-oiled machine firing on all cylinders, thrusting you through the densely layered narrative without so much as a hiccup. And perhaps most importantly, despite its highly allegorical nature, the film never compromises on the entertainment value and emotional catharsis of its literal story and characters. It's not often you see a film realize its ambition this resoundingly. Don't miss it.Strong 4.5/5",9,0,2,4 November 2019
Marriage Story," Solid 4.5 // Family dramas don't get much better than this.
","Easily one of the best films of the year. Noah Baumbach tells this story of divorce with a level of insight and grace that could only come from an intimate personal connection with the material. It's a profoundly empathic film that cares deeply for the flawed humanity of its characters, honest people who become incrementally entangled in a treacherous legal and emotional web. And despite the darkness of the subject matter, Baumbach, Johansson, and Driver are able to inject so many moments of tenderness, honesty, and raw emotion that the film manages to leave you with a sense of hope for its characters despite the seemingly hopeless situation.

Black Panther," In a word: bland.
","Full disclosure: I'm not a fan of Marvel films. I haven't watched a film in this series since Guardians of the Galaxy, and my reactions to the few I've seen have generally ranged from indifference to hatred. If you consider yourself a fan, feel free to take my thoughts with a grain of salt or just ignore me completely.With that being said, the best I can say about Black Panther is I didn't actively dislike it as much as I have some other Marvel films. I mostly just found it incredibly lifeless and boring. There is a pervasive feeling of blandness and inertia that plagues this film from beginning to end. Nearly the first full hour feels like an exercise in directionless wheel-spinning. On paper, it makes some sense to spend the first chunk of the film world-building and introducing us to the new environment and characters before the plot kicks in, and I guess the film attempts that? Kind of? But sadly, sweeping, panoramic, CGI vistas of the city don't really count as 'world-building' in my book. And almost every scene in Wakanda that isn't a CGI flyover takes place on a small greenscreen-shrouded soundstage. It all has a sterile, artificial, and clinical feel and the culture of the city simply doesn't translate into something tangible.The characters don't fare better. For all of the buzz about this being Marvel's 'character-driven' film, what really surprised me the most was just how uninspired these characters were. The villain is the only one who rises slightly above the pack, but he's really only interesting in a relative sense given that every other character here is flat and generic. Andy Serkis as the side-kick villain was ok too I guess; he was one-note, sure, but at least he had a note. In a particularly eye-roll inducing scene, we see the 'elder' Wakandan (Forest Whitaker's character) killed off by the villain in melodramatic fashion. Am I supposed to care? This 'character' had literally no establishment, personality, or stake in the film whatsoever. He's the older dude with the long robe who's probably wise or something. He died now. Feel something.At least the film had a message though, right? It was about something more than a good guy fighting a bad guy! In the most superficial of senses, yes. But the fact that this film is being seen as some sort of political statement heralded for its cultural insight is ridiculous. The 'substance' of this film is essentially a sprinkling of heavy-handed dialogue which references topical issues like immigration and identity politics. It amounts to an illusion of depth to distract you from what is, at its core, another standard and vapid comic book film.Strong 2/5",4,12,24,26 February 2018
The Greatest Showman," A sugar rush
","Quite a frustrating film. The musical numbers are far and away its strongest attribute, which is obviously what any good musical should strive for. Although they aren't all showstoppers, there are some genuinely excellent sequences with tight, kinetic editing, great rhythmic camera movements, and vibrant choreography. The first proper musical number that acts as a prologue to Barnum's life was quite impressive with its fluid execution and ability to convey a large amount of information in a short period of time (which ironically is a quality that ends up being to the film's detriment when viewed as a whole... more on that later). Jackman's and Efron's bar duet is another fun and energetic sequence with a lot of cool camerawork and infectious energy. Essentially all of the songs are pleasant, catchy, and memorable as well, if a bit vanilla.The strength of these musical sequences is enough to save the film from being bad, and is even almost enough to outweigh the many, many flaws... but not quite. Firstly, the film is attractive to look at to be sure, but it is at times so incredibly glossy that it feels like you're watching a shampoo or jewelry commercial. Sure, it's going for that fairy tale feel, but at times the sheen and shimmer is a little too blinding. And that high-gloss polish is a symptom of a much deeper problem: the incredibly superficial quality of the story and its characters. It's disappointing because this story is genuinely interesting and has the potential for a lot of moral exploration that is completely passed over. Again, I get that this is a musical and a family film, but that doesn't mean it has to be vapid and stupid (see: La La Land). I found it extremely troubling that the film completely ignored the moral quandary of whether Barnum was helping these 'unique' people, or exploiting them for his own fame and fortune. These characters never even question his intent, viewing the situation as Barnum helping to 'put them out there', gain them social acceptance, and create a 'family', where in reality they're quite clearly being taken advantage of in a way that is arguably more reprehensible morally than the protesters who mock them. It's a truly glaring omission from the film that saps so much potential substance from the story.Contributing to the superficial feeling of the film is another all-to common problem that modern American family films suffer from: the pacing is way too fast. It's like the studios are afraid people will be bored by their films, and thus they design them to speed through plot points and character development in a way that ends up suffocating the life from it. Sure this approach makes the film feel lively and exciting, but it also robs it of actual, meaningful character interactions and development. The result is a film that feels like all dessert and no main course - a bowl of chocolate ice cream sure tastes great but it's no substitute for a satiating meal.Another nitpick that bothered me enough that I have to mention it: why is a renowned 19th Century opera singer belting out a Celine Dion-esque pop tune for an adoring 'high brow' audience in a classic theater? That scene was almost laughable in its absurdity. And although it was by far the worst offender, I would say in general the music in the film, while catchy, did clash somewhat with the period.Honestly, I really should be giving this film a lower score. Somehow I enjoyed it quite a bit even in the face of the many fundamental issues, which is a testament to the strength of the best sequences. Still this is a deeply flawed film that, for all its visual splendor and admittedly intoxicating energy, amounts to little more than a sugar rush.Strong 2.5/5",5,174,338,26 February 2018
Moonrise Kingdom," Bursting at the seams with creativity, wit, and charm.
","Moonrise Kingdom tells the story of two troubled, misunderstood kids who meet and bond over their inability to fit in. It's certainly not a revolutionary plot, but this movie is anything but run-of-the-mill. Quite the opposite actually – it's fantastic. Equal parts quirky, charming, witty, and genuinely funny, it's a deft and completely distinctive rendition of this well-worn tale. There're just so many great things to say about this film. Right from the opening credits it establishes a very unique tone with the musical selection, setting, and (most notably) the camera-work. The cinematography remains consistently amazing throughout the movie, utilizing really creative, often symmetrical shot compositions and lots of side-tracking pans. The visuals play an integral role in setting the off-kilter and playful atmosphere of the film (think Fantastic Mr. Fox, Wes Anderson's last film). The cast is also excellent across the board, and what's really impressive is that the two child leads manage to steal the show from huge names like Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, and Bill Murray. And the success of the two leads isn't just due to acting ability, it's also simply because the characters are really well-crafted and endearing. They both have an unabashed eccentricity and deadpan humor (think Napoleon Dynamite) that just makes them very likable and easy to root for. The deadpan humor is also a very integral part of the success of the film. There's definitely a serious message here about never compromising who you are to fit in with crowd, but it's delivered in a very light-hearted, good-humored way that never takes itself too seriously.Overall, Moonrise Kingdom is a movie that gets nearly everything right. It's a movie during which you just can't help but smile from beginning to end and which is bursting at the seams with creativity, wit, and charm. The only real criticisms I can muster is that the middle third drags just a tad and that I wish there was a bit more resolution with Mr. and Mrs. Bishop (the parent characters of the female lead). Aside from these minor quibbles though, the movie impresses on every level and is a thoroughly entertaining and heartwarming affair.",9,2,3,16 November 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Falls victim to the same missteps that have always plagued this series.
","I really wanted to like this movie. While the Harry Potter film franchise has never fully convinced me that it is capable of producing movies with any true lasting value, it has at least always spawned reasonably good films that, despite their missteps, are mostly enjoyable and entertaining on an initial viewing. However, the unbelievably excellent reviews for this movie really had me expecting something more this time. I was hoping to finally see a Harry Potter film that wasn't just serviceable and entertaining, but was truly a great film in terms of storytelling, pacing, craft, and execution. Sadly, I feel the final Harry Potter film falls victim to the exact same missteps that have plagued the series throughout its production. Sure, there are a number of things that this film does very well. The special effects are absolutely through the roof, the atmosphere and camera-work are suitably dark and ominous, and there a few very emotionally potent scenes, such as Snape's death and the discovery that Harry makes about his past soon after. Yet the core elements necessary for the foundation of the film are simply lacking, almost absent in certain cases. The interplay between the characters, all of whom we are supposed to be emotionally invested in and cheering for, seems oddly muted. There is a distinct lack of emotional interplay between characters at times when these emotions seem like they should be at their greatest. The moment where Ron and Hermione realize that Harry has decided to sacrifice himself to Voldemort feels extremely underplayed. They barely even try to stop him and seem extremely ready and willing to make peace with the fact that their best friend of 7 years has decided he must die. Also, when Harry magically resurrects himself from the dead (still trying to figure that one out.. the way it is presented in the film is quite confusing), he doesn't receive the reception that you would assume he would. His companions respond almost as if they expected him to come back to life all long. However, I feel the biggest and most damning issue with the film is the pacing and storytelling technique, especially in the latter portion after Harry is killed. The movie seems to speed hastily through the moments that require the most attention and should be the most emotionally resonant, while dwelling on and extending other scenes beyond their welcome. This absolutely kills the narrative drive of the movie, pulling you out of the action and lessening the scale and the potential emotional impact of the proceedings. The scene after Harry dies and where he meets Dumbledore is obviously a pivotal scene, but the length that it extends through coupled with its positioning squarely at the climax of the movie detracts from the flow and suspense. On the other hand, the scene that this entire decade's worth of movies has been building to where Harry and Voldemort finally clash is treated in an almost business-like fashion. The fight itself feels a bit hasty, but the real problem is that there is no emotional resolution after Voldemort is finally killed. None of the characters even mention or react to what has transpired. This is an absolutely unforgivable misstep because it undermines the entire event, as well as the 7 previous movies that have led to it. There is no emotional culmination and/or resolution with any of the characters after the evil they have been fighting for so long has finally been vanquished. Instead, we are led straight to the epilogue in less than 10 minutes with hardly a line of dialogue from anyone other than Harry, Ron, or Hermione, none of whom have anything to discuss except for details concerning the Elder Wand. The sense of accomplishment, gratification, resolution, or relief seems entirely absent.At the end of the day though, this is not a horrible movie. It certainly has a number of entertaining scenes and, like the films that came before it, is mostly entertaining and relatively solid. However, it falls victim to the same narrative-driven problems that the other films suffer from and, in this case, the missteps are particularly unforgivable given that this film is the final installment and the one where emotional resonance and correct pacing is the most vital. For that reason, although it is probably one of the better films in the series, I can't give it more than 2 stars. Admittedly, it feels a tad low, but the flaws are simply too significant to be overlooked and they fatally wound what could've been a satisfying conclusion to a relatively solid franchise.",4,3,4,2 November 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Better than the first, but there's still room for improvement.
","Catching Fire makes a number of improvements over its lackluster predecessor and is a much better film for it. After a very strong first half though, it takes a bit of a dive and by the end I was left a little underwhelmed.Before I get to that though- the positives. One of my biggest problems with the first film was that it took a weighty, horrific, and tragic concept and turned it into a film that felt too light and easily digestible. It could be the fault of the source material (I haven't read any of the novels), but it felt like so much thematic potential was wasted on flimsy, poorly choreographed action sequences and a hackneyed love plot. After a promising half-hour, the film quickly devolved into a standard action/thriller affair that barely scratched the surface of the intriguing concept. Catching Fire definitely rectifies this for the most part. It feels appropriately weighty and more solemn that the first film with public executions and other atrocities of the Capitol put on clear display. It also delves more into the psychology of fear and how it can be used to oppress which is a welcomed bit of depth.The excellent cast helps to sell all of these heavier moments. The acting in the film is uniformly excellent, and once again Stanley Tucci steals every scene that he's in. The award for most improved character unequivocally goes to Katniss though. In the first film I felt that she came off as overly stoic and enigmatic. I realize that these traits are supposed to be elements of her character, but on screen it didn't translate well and she seemed emotionally flat and distant. Katniss in Catching Fire is a much more dynamic character with clear moments of desperation, helplessness, strength, and resolve. Thanks to the excellent performance of Jennifer Lawrence and the improved script, she feels like a much more fully realized character with the power and charisma to properly carry the film. Like its predecessor though, Catching Fire is still a very front-loaded film. Essentially every great scene in the movie is over by the time it reaches the halfway point. One scene in particular I found to be particularly well done was the scene where Katniss and Peta are broadcast to the Capitol for the first time outside of their houses in Victors' Village. The scene jumps back and forth between the bright, glittery stage of the Capitol where the broadcast is being played and the barren, dark, and dreary village. It creates a poignant visual metaphor that very successfully conveys the superficiality of the games that comes across it a subtle and tasteful way. I sensed a bit of social commentary in this scene as well concerning our own entertainment in the real world and how superficial and plastic it so often is. The weighty, intriguing scenes like this though slowly but surely gave way to a final act that once again left me wanting more. The hunger games themselves were definitely better in this film than they were in the last. The participants felt a little more fleshed-out and had their own distinct personalities rather than the one-dimension villainous participants we were treated to in the first film. The action sequences were also choreographed and filmed much more coherently. Still though, I felt the portion of the movie that takes place in the hunger games once again disrupted the flow of the film and deadened the narrative tension that had been building up until that point. Once the games start, there is almost no attention paid to any of the characters other than those inside the dome. All of the thematically interesting, morally thought-provoking scenes are left behind for uninspired action sequences which just drag on and on. We basically just watch Katniss and friends run away from poison fog, rabid apes, tidal waves and other dangerous things over and over. It's a jarring transition from all of the political intrigue and dramatic, weighty character interactions that came before and just sticks out like a sore thumb. Ultimately, Catching Fire takes a lot of steps in the right direction but there's still undoubtedly room for improvement. It once again fails to fully impress with the actual hunger games portion of the film but there's also a lot of powerfully acted and poignant moments as well before it enters that final slog. These are the moments that give me hope that the series will be able to truly deliver on its interesting premise in future films.",7,0,15,26 November 2013
Annihilation," A mixed bag bolstered by a fantastic finale, striking visuals, and challenging themes
","Annihilation is another solid entry in the dark, cerebral sci-fi genre for director Alex Garland, though compared to his debut (Ex Machina) it is decidedly less consistent. The film's somber atmosphere and otherworldly visuals are its major strengths. There are some truly striking and memorable images in this film that manage to be alien, haunting, and disarmingly beautiful, often all at the same time. The final act of the film is certainly its centerpiece and is where its most powerful and piercing images reside. These final 20 minutes are where the film reaches its full potential, offering up a nearly wordless denouement that is hypnotic, visually spectacular, and unsettlingly bizarre. It's certainly worth seeing just for this sequence.What comes before the finale is more of a mixed bag. I get the sense that the core goal for this film was to capture that warped, uncanny quality of like-minded classic sci-fi films like Tarkovsky's Stalker while exploring the nature of identity and other philosophical and psychological themes. It is at its best in its most uncompromising and avant-garde moments that dive head-first into achieving that goal. However, there are a considerable number of sequences in the film that feel more traditional and comparatively uninspired, more along the lines of what you would see in a less heady and ambitious sci-fi thriller. Given that Garland was picked up by a major studio (Paramount) for this release based on the success of Ex Machina, which was a much smaller and more independent production, I have to wonder if these were concessions made to the studio to make the film more accessible to a wide audience.On further investigation, there is some evidence to support this idea as Paramount reportedly nearly forced Garland to significantly alter the finale due to poor test screenings, fearing the film was 'too intellectual' and would not play well to a wide audience. Ultimately, Garland fought and won the battle to keep the film unaltered, though the result was that Paramount backed out on giving it an international theatrical release, shifting the rights to Netflix instead for regions outside of the U.S., Canada, and China. This kind of pressure from major studios is so often what suffocates the artistic integrity of directors and, although Garland succeeded in keeping the film unaltered for a hefty price, it's possible that this pressure influenced the film and contributed to the clash between the more uncompromising elements and the somewhat mundane, typical thriller sequences.Still, the film at large succeeds as a worthy addition to the genre even if it doesn't quite reach the artistry of a film like Under the Skin (a much more uncompromising modern sci-fi classic that I highly recommend if you enjoyed this). Although I didn't love the whole film, I wholeheartedly recommend it to fans of the genre based on the strength of its visuals and its fantastic final act. It certainly further establishes Garland as a talent to watch and I'm excited for his future output, especially if he's able to work with a studio that is willing to trust him with full creative control.Strong 3.5/5",7,47,93,2 March 2018
