Scarface," Powerful and Unique
","Scarface is one of those movies that made an revolutionary impact on its time, its one of the few movie that affected the culture of its time, The movie Shows the Rise and fall of Tony Montana(Al Pacino). Oliver Stones Screenplay in this movie is simply great, But what made this movie so powerful is the way AL Pacino portrayed Tony Montanans Character, If you have seen Al Pacino in his other movies, You will be Shocked with how much he changed his Voice, Looks and Even Physique for this movie, and if you haven't seen his previous performance than you will think this is how Al Pacino naturally is. Most Gangster movies has an emotional part in them, this is where Scarface is different. It simply is what the reality of the situation should be. If you haven't seen this epic movie, than i suggest you buy or rent this movie and experience what such hype is all about.",8,2,5,16 September 2010
Citizen Kane," A masterpiece but a masterpiece that's not for everyone
","Citizen Kane is arguably one of the most groundbreaking movies ever made. its hard to believe that this movie was considered to be a huge flop the time it was released and people booed it for even getting nominated for the academy awards, i guess it received its glory long after it was released. Orson Welles did an outstanding job directing the movie given the time it was created, he pushed all boundaries of movie making. That is the true reason why Citizen Kane is called the greatest movie of all time by so many people, not for its depth of emotion or performance but for what a breakthrough it really was. All of the Cast did their job well. They were very much in their character, Whether it was important character like Joseph Cotten as Jedidiah or Small character like Ray Collins as Getty's. Orson Welles did and Excellent job as Kane. The movie Shows the Rise and Fall of the Great Charles Foster Kane, It shows how his life really was , how he never wanted money for himself, how he was Both Bad and good at the same time. The Movie has amazing amount of depth in it, But still the movie is not without it's flaws, The Biggest Flaw of the movie is how it is shown and at the same time that same thing is its biggest Strength. The Movie is Somehow Dark and Dirty, Where Many like my self will love the movie, many will find it to be boring and out of pace. I think its safe to say no matter how great the movie is, its not Timeless. It never really touched the Level People Expected, Over expectation killed the movie. This movie is a Masterpiece but a masterpiece that is not for everyone.",8,0,1,11 February 2011
Suicide Squad," Sits somewhere between good and really bad
","I went into this movie with rather high expectations, I was one of the peoples who appreciated BatmanVSuperman and felt it could boost DC into a good string of action films. Suicide squad was one of the movies first in line to this new-found momentum and it started out amazingly well. The opening is designed masterfully and you can see the effort put in to instantly grab the attention of the fans.Unfortunately, after that, everything falls flat on their face. Most of the side characters feel out of place and go through no real development. Which is a real shame because in terms of performance Margot Robbie really knocked it out of the park and Jared Leto held his own. If there was more consistent character development across the board and fewer plot holes coupled with a better story, then this could have been a movie many would love. The direction from David Ayer also deserves a fair amount of criticism as well as the camera work in any scene that does not sport action. Expect this to be very similar to BVS in terms of box office numbers but the opposite in slow appreciation. A decent flick that could have been way better",5,2,9,5 August 2016
Taxi Driver," A true classic
",Taxi driver is one of those movie that after watching you can say 'that was unique' Robert De Niro Played the character of Travis Bickle with all his heart and soul. It also gave him his signature line 'you talking to me?'.Robert De Niro actually left his original life style and worked as a cab driver to get the feeling of the character. In every scene whether its a loner or a obsessed person De Niro played it with almost perfection. Cybill shepherd also performed her character very sincerely. The Direction of Martin Scorsese is not the best that you will see but is better than most directions today. The movie a true classic and if you haven't watched it than i strongly suggest you to rent or even better buy this movie and you will understand whats the movie is all about.,8,0,0,16 September 2010
The Godfather: Part II," There Never Will be a Sequel like this or One This Good
","The Brilliant Companion piece to the original ' The Godfather' continues the saga of two generations of successive power within the Corleone family, Legendary Director Francis Ford Coppola tells two stories in the 'The Godfather Part 2' , The roots and rise of the young Don Vito Corleone played with uncanny ability by Robert De Niro and The Ascension of Micheal Corleone played with Unreal Ability of AL Pacino. Reassembling many of the talents who helped make the 'The Godfather' A Legend and the most successful motion picture of its time, Francis Ford Coppola Produced a movie of staggering magnitude and vision like any other. The Godfather 2 is undeniably the best sequel ever made, and maybe even superior to the Original 'The Godfather' which is considered to be the best movie ever made by many critics and actors. The movie is one of the few movies close to perfection. Francis proved his worth and created the level of greatness when it came to direction in the movie industry through The Godfather Saga. The Acting skills shown in The Godfather 2 by Robert De Niro and AL Pacino are truly something you have to see to believe. Robert De Niro portrayed the character of the young Vito Corleone with such effort that he actually made people believe he was the young Marlon Brando. But AL Pacino even topped De Niro and gave a performance which is one of the few characters to be present on every list of great characters in the film history. AL Pacino's Portrayal of Micheal Corleone was so believable that people forget that they are watching a movie when he was performing. Legendary method actor Lee Strasbourg also made his debut in the film industry with this movie and he proved why he is considered to be such an Icon in the world of Acting. Even the characters which are not that important leave a mark of their own. The Godfather 2 is truly one of the greatest films ever made, and there never will be a sequel like this again or one this good.",10,1,4,20 October 2010

Salt," Overthetop but Entertainment at its best
","I really don't understand all the negative comments about this movie. I mean sure 'Salt' Is not a masterpiece Action Film but its also far from being a bad movie. Salt has this Sense of Rush throughout the entire film that keeps you interested. its full of Energy, Rush and Action. Angelina Jolie Did a Fine job as Salt. She actually made her character look Stronger than she is. Even though some Scenes are a little too Illogical but to be honest it won't bother the Viewers, all this Intensity with Angelina Jolie's Beauty made it very Entertaining. As for the Plot it's not perfect but considering the Genre Salt Belongs too you don't really need an amazing Plot to make a good action film. Salt is Entertaining and Entertainment is what people Expect from a Action Movie, that's what you will get from salt",7,1,3,18 November 2010

So apparently this guy , the vampire is knows as Edward Cullen and he finds the unusual emo babe attractive,, i mean not literally her,, but he likes her blood, he is you know just addicted to her blood and at the same time he loves her,, so we have a guy who loves a girl who he wants to eat!! :P, oh and did i mention, this movie has a definition of their own for vampires,, according to them, vampires can be vegetarian (only eat animals blood) and the biggest shock of them all ,, Vampires freaking Spark in Sunlight! I mean common! the guy who created Vampires is lucky to be dead, cause if he saw how his creation is being insulted he would have had a heard attack or something, moving on, so they end up in a relationship, but their is a twist in the story,, there is this other guy,, who looks like the king of steroids , all muscle and stuff, he loves the unusual pale babe too!! woohoo! a love triangle now this girl who claims to have the purest of love for the vampire guy,, is now confused who she really loves, some love eh? anyways, enter evil vampires, one day the vampire boy calls his human emo girlfriend to play thunder baseball! but remember how i mentioned that the emo girl named Bella has a very attracting blood? i mean for vampires, anyways some really evil bad Vampires goes crazy by her smell and comes looking for her,, of course the Cullen's protect her, but later they go after her anyways, it ends up in a fight which the Cullen's with and yeah at the end the vampire boy sucks up his girlfriends blood but doesn't suck on long enough to kill her, talk about choosing love over food :P, and so the movie ends, so what i thought about the movie? well i guess if you are one of those guys who have seen classic vampire movies you should just avoid this weird movie, but since its SO famous i guess its good for single teen girls who have nothing interesting in their lives, and yeah some weird guys might like it too, if they are single and miserable that is !!!",Null,1,2,22 August 2011
The Pianist," More than just a Movie
","How often do you see a movie that is capable of touching your Heart? how often do you see a movie that will occupy your thoughts for a good while? Roman Polanski's 'The Pianist' is one of those rare breed of movies that can actually do that. It's undoubtedly one of the most impressive movies you will ever see. From The Solid Direction Of Roman Polanski to the Flawless acting of Adrien Brody This Movie without a doubt can be called a Masterpiece. The Movie is based on The true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, who in the 1930s was considered one of the most accomplished Pianist. But the movie is not about his fame, Nor his Glory as a pianist. It's About A Polish Jew, who fought against all odds, Faced situations that he never even imagined and Finally Survived by losing almost everything and everyone he loved. It shows not only a tale of horrific surviving, but also the emotions that many people had to face and fight in order to live. It makes you wonder how people who really faced and Fought against those odd and lived, makes you ask yourself what would i do in that situation? The Cast is great, Whether it is a important character like Fox as Dorota or Minor character such as Ronan Vibert as Janina's Husband. But Adrian Broody Truly proved his worth as an actor in this film, i mean he was so into the character that he will make you believe that he really is Szpilman, He lost over 14 kilograms and developed a unusual body language for some scenes, and an actor of his level deserve much more recognition, but it's a fact that people nowadays prefer flash and looks over true art, however if you are one of those who can appreciate a true masterpiece you must have a look at 'The Pianist'",9,2,3,4 May 2011
Dog Day Afternoon," Prerapare To Be Wowed
","Dog Day Afternoon is one of 70's best movie. Legendary Actor Al Pacino Plays the tough role of Sonny, One of the most weird yet interesting Characters of all time. John Cazale Plays the Role of Sal. Now this is one of those rear movie that will make you laugh and yet at the same time it will make you think about the intensity of the situation. Sidney Lumet is at his best in this movie. He directed the movie beautifully. The cast was also perfect for their roles. Whether it was Charles Durning as Moretti or Carol Kane as Jenny. As for the Performance Al Pacino never let's his viewers down when he is given a proper role. Al Pacino Played his Role Perfectly, and So did John Cazale. I cannot imagine anyone except for AL AND JOHN As Sonny and Sal. It's a must see for those who know the real value of a masterpiece, and this one won't let you down",9,0,0,3 April 2011

The Da Vinci Code," A movie that not everyone will like
","Da Vinci Code is one of those movies that followed a certain bold yet somehow logical idea, many people hate it, and many love it, i guess it depends what kind of person you are, if you are open to any thought and just aren't really afraid to think the unthinkable you might just like this movies, on the other hand if you are a person who lives by certain codes and follows certain way of life you probably wouldn't like it, so without spoiling much about this movie, i will just suggest you to keep and open mind to this, the thought of this movie might be very disturbing for some people where others might be impressed with such vision. The cast and Direction both are above average , Tom hanks did a good job like he always does bought the character to life , so did the others. This is a bold yet somehow powerful movie, and understanding the story greatly help's if you have read the original book.",7,0,0,21 May 2011
The Green Mile," A Unique Experience
","The Green mile is one of the few movie that did justice to the novel it was created from. The Direction of Frank Dartbont is simply artistic. The movie did all justice to Stephen Kings legendary novel. It did made some minor changes but that was necessary to present the movie. The Movie represents more than just cops, prisoners and a guy with powers. The Movie Shows the depth of what our world slowly is becoming, and how people face injustice. Each and Every scene from the novel is perfectly presented in the movie. As for the performance the whole cast did a great job. but Michael Clarke Duncan stole the show. he expressed his emotion just as the character was supposed to be. Tom hanks executed his performance with the uncanny ability that he posses. David Morse, Bonnie hunt, James Cromwell, Michael Jeter, Graham Greene, Doug Hutchinson, Sam Rockwell, Jeffrey DeMunn all performed with all heart and soul. The movie is very powerful overall. If you still haven't seen this unique gem, than i suggest you rent or even better but it and you will see what all the hype is all about. Cause if you are a movie fan and you haven't seen this movie you will miss something that's unique",8,1,3,19 September 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," Stephen King Is Legend
","The Shawshank Redemption is simply one of the most emotionally strong movies made, Even Though it's not Divine, But The movie is still very powerful and interesting. The Cast is very Strong and Believable. Tim Robbins as Andy and Morgan Freeman as Red are just perfect.Bob Gunton as Warden Norton also did a great job. Like most of the movies created from Stephen Kings creativity this too is a great piece of gem. The Direction is one of the strongest of the 90s and the movie itself is has become the pride of the 90s era. All though the movie has many flaws but they are not really noticeable and does not really bother you. The movie is not the greatest you will see, but i can assure that its a movie worth watching for sure.",7,0,0,31 October 2010
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Not as bad as people say, not as good as we expected either
","So I will make this review as short as possible because I would like to keep it spoiler free while touching on major subjects. Now to begin, Batman V Superman is a well-executed film, with rather creative ideas behind it. However, DC did a gigantic mistake by not having more movies around all 3 characters so it would make sense. Why is Batman the way he is here ? Sure us comic fans can assume and probably make sense, but what about the casual audience ? Yeah we needed a movie about this batman firstWhy should I care so much about Superman ? We didn't see him adjust later on and weren't able to make sense after the first movie, so yes we needed another one from him as well.Why on earth will I like this Wonderwomen ? for the very same reasons, we needed a movie.Look at Marvel, despite being far inferior in content creation and quality, they did movies about their superheroes before so we can actually be hyped about what they offer. Instead of jamming everything in. Not to mention the multiple plot holes and stupid decisions. That all being said, every character except Alex (Lex's son) delivered. Ben was a surprisingly good Batman and whatever shortcomings that were there came in with the writing and not his ability as an actor, on his end he was Solid. Overall decent movie, but feels rushed and doesn't have enough reason for us to care enough about the characters. The world building went wrong for DC",6,0,4,26 March 2016
Apollo 13," A Successful Failure
","The movie shows one of mankind's greatest achievements, It has all the elements to keep anyone at the edge of their seats. Ron Howard did a great job of directing this film, Every actor did their part with pure dedication, Tom hanks proved why he is one of the greatest of all time. The movie is about the 3rd attempt of America to land on the moon and how it failed to reach its original destination and still became a phenomenon. As the movie goes on it reveals a lot more than just the journey. It shows the human kind can overcome any odd if they truly want to. It also shows how determination is superior than the problem. The Movie is very well put together. Every scene shows more than what one will expect. This is one of those movie that one can say after seeing' yes that was a good one'",9,0,0,17 September 2010
