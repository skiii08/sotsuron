It," This is such an over rated film
","I had watched it in the cinema with a couple of my friends and my sister. As people had raved about it so much, I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. Some scenes were great and had amazing acting. However overall the film was not scary and I wouldn't class it as a horror movie. So with this disappointing outcome of the movie, I decided to watch it again at home with my nephew, keep in mind that this film was rated a 15 and he was 10, he also didn't find it scary. Personally, I think that this film was over rated for a horror movie as I enjoy being scared by them, disappointing me as I had payed lots of money to see it.",6,1,2,29 April 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," Definitely recommend
","This film is one of the best films I've ever seen. It gives you a realistic story line of how the prison system works. My friends first Persuaded me to watch it, while I thought it was going to be very boring, and now it is one of my favourite films. It makes you go on an emotional rollercoaster and the ending is so unpredictable. My friends and I still quote this movie and having seen it a hundred times we still all love it. It is a great film to watch with family and friends and is an all time classic to watch.",10,0,0,29 April 2019
