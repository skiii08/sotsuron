Black Swan," Very good movie, impecable acting
","This is a really good movie; the acting of everyone is amazing specially Natalie Portman's acting, the recording was beautiful, also it was the scenography. I would have liked it even more if it would have been longer where you can see why the child behavior she had (like the 8 year old room she had, for example) and the obsessive mom. Also, I would have liked to see more of Winona Ryder, I think she wasn't really necessary in this movie, but she could have been.",9,0,1,29 April 2020
Edward Scissorhands," A beautiful and emotional film
","I loved this film but I didn't like the end. The scenography was very different from other movies, two contrasts between the 'sweet' neighborhood represented by pastel color houses and the house of Edward (who was lonely and sad) represented by dark colors. The acting and script were amazing. My only problem was the end, I think Kim and her family could have seen him every day and given him food, but they abandoned him... I would have just change the end.",9,0,1,26 April 2020
