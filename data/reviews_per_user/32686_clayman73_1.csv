The Ring," Faithful to Japanese original, great movie
","I saw The Ring last night at a preview screening...and it was great!! I had seen the original Japanese version and it truly creeped me out. I love movies, scary, thrillers, gore, I love them all. I would say I'm pretty jaded with scary movies and don't get scared easily anymore, but I still watch them for the fun. I rented Ringu and watched it alone one night. And it creeped the hell out of me. Since then, I've recommended it to everyone I know. It's not at every video store, so you'll have to search for it. In SF, it's at LeVideo. Anyway, I was excited about the remake, esp. since it was starring one of my new favorite actresses, Naomi Watts. I was kind of upset of the PG13 rating. Well, I can tell you...it was still creepy, very faithful, and a job well done. I hope it becomes a huge hit, it deserves to be seen by a lot of people, and that it doesn't get ignored. The filmmakers should be very proud. As in the original, there is no blood, no gore, just images and trippy visuals that will make you look in awe and mezmerize you. You're involved right away in this tape and you want to know what it's all about.  Not all remakes are good at all, this one is really really good. I hope you all see it. But if you want a real creep out, find the original.",8,0,0,13 October 2002
