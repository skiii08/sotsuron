The Ring," Not scary, just a cheap thrill kind of a movie that definitly missed!
","This movie was terrible.  Even when they had something that was kindof creepy, they ruined it by over explaining it, and then they didn't explain whole other important parts!  All these new ghost movies contacting people, wanting to be found, are making me sick.  6th sence and stir of echos could make it work but the ring and fear.com are just getting ridiculous! Niether even gave me a goose bump!  Instead they just try to creep people out by flashes of disturbing images.  Oooh!  Maggots!  The fingernail coming off has definitly been done, (stir of echos did it in a close up, and in silence of the lambs they even had the nail embedded in the wall of a well!) yes it is gross, but come up with something new..",Null,0,1,10 May 2003
