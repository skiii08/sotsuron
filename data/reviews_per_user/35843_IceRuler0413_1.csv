The Sound of Music," You cant live without seeing it!!
","This has to be the greatest musical of all time. An amazing musical score and stunning choreography, no home should be without a copy of this timeless classic.This musical is known by everybody and is suitable for all ages. A Happy family film with no sex, violence or bad language. The young actors playing the roles of the Trap children are amazing and Andrews gives a performance to be remembered for a lifetime as Maria, a young Nun who becomes a cheerful governess.This is definitely a family movie to be watched together on a Sunday Afternoon!!",Null,0,6,11 August 2004
