Vertigo," Nice one, Hitch!
","I am very glad I took the time to locate this video, which is extremely difficult to find, but all the time and my $1.65 certainly paid off. Even though the movie did not receive the appreciation it deserves when it was released in 1958, Vertigo has proven another Hitchcock classic.James Stewart stars as the leading male, Detective Scotty Ferguson, a policeman with acrophobia, a disease he found out he had at the worst possible time- whilst hanging from a gutter 10 storeys above the San Francisco streets. His fears cause him to retire from the force, when an old friend hires him to look after his wife, Madeleine(Kim Novak), because of her strange behaviour. After saving her life, Scotty falls in love with Madeleine whilst helping her deal with her mental problems, but the plot is set to thicken as Scotty's fear of heights the one factor that could stop him from saving the woman he loves. Stewart and Novak, in her best performance, are stunning the film, which has a great storyline and the best setting, the golden city of San Francisco. 4 stars, a must for any hitchock fan.",Null,2,4,1 November 2003
Psycho," Im still thinking, 3 months on...
","Psycho (1960) Director: Alfred Hitchcock Writer: Robert Bloch (Novel), Jospeh Stefano (Screen play) Stars: Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates), Janet Leigh (Marion Crane), Vera Miles (Lila Crane), Martin Balsam (Detective Arbogast), John Gavin (Sam Loomis).Psycho is a classic horror film and is the one that set the standard for all future movies of the genre. It was released in 1960 (And then remade in 1998), and regarded as Alfred Hitchcock's greatest film. I made the mistake of watching the remake first, but I watched the original while at my sister's house and could tell which one was better. I could clearly see why this is probably the greatest horror film ever made, and by history's best director.The events of the movie left me in awe, and an instant Hitchcock fan. The film starts in Phoenix, Arizona where Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a real estate agent receptionist, is trusted to deliver a large sum of money from a customer and put it in the bank. However, Marion's wicked side takes control and causes her to flee from the city to her boyfriend's (John Gavin) house in California. Due to her suspicious acts, she attracts the attention of a policeman, forcing her to trade her car in. Soon the trademark stormy weather causes more troubles for Marion, making her spend the night at the mysterious hotel, with 12 cabins, 12 vacancies, and 12 showers. Marion's story soon evolves when she meets the owner, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), and learns he has a dark past of his own. From then on the plot twists will shock you, and the suspense will certainly keep you on the edge of your seat.Perkins is very convincing as Bates, and the way he fills the role of mother's-boy Norman is certainly impressive. Janet Leigh offers a great supporting role, and makes you feel sorry for throughout the film, despite her character's evil deeds. Balsam, for the short period he is in the film, gives that classic detective character whom we all know and love.The setting is possibly one of the best sets in Hollywood, because it is so eerie and mysterious. The Bates mansion, which overlooks the motel, sends chills down your spine as you see the dark silhouette sitting by the window. The camera work for the film contributed greatly to its success, like many other Hitchock films. The affects are astounding for a 1960 film. Hitchock's decision to film in black and white paid off, as it gave the movie charm, and hid the fact most of the blood was just chocolate sauce. The music is the most famous movie music ever- the screeching violin in sync with the killer's knife landing on their victim. Psycho has been parodied again and again, because it so popular. It was followed by Psycho II (1982), Psycho III (1986) and psycho IV: The beginning (1990). The movie may not be appreciated so much by younger viewers, but anyone old enough will love how the film is shot, written and acted, as well as making you think. Watch this classic at night, with the lights off. And if you don't like being scared, shower before the movie.",Null,0,1,29 October 2003
