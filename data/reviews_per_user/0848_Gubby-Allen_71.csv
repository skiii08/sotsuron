The Avengers," It should keep the kids amused for a bit.
","I watched this without knowing anything about it at all.Some people argued, some people shouted back at them, then some other people chased some other people, then they all had a fight, then had to make some decisions.Then a load of monsters and superheroes turned up, then all of the same things happened again but with the superheroes involved this time and with explosions too and more fighting, it seemed to be over something important.Then one of the teams won, which seemed to be the right result looking at the people I was watching it with.I had a feeling I had seen this or a similar story in something once, when I was a kid but everyone else who watched it with me seemed to be interested, so should keep the kids amused for a while.",2,2,9,27 December 2014
Vertigo," Not one of Hitchcocks best.
","I love Hitchcock films, but to bracket this as the best film ever is laughable, it's not in Hitchcock's top 5.Rear Window, North by Northwest & even Psycho are as good & as tense as a thriller can be keeping you on the edge of your seat. This doesn't.Don't get me wrong, it's still a good film, very good maybe & has one or two brilliant twists but there's too many faults with.SpoilersIt's a good 20 minutes too long, once Madeline returns as Judy some of the scenes really take a bit of believing. What sort of woman lets a man alter everything about her within 5 minutes of meeting her. If she wanted him to discover her true identity why not say so? She was identical once the clothes were bought.I wasn't too enthralled with the ending either and thought Gavin may have made another appearance.I can't make up my mind about James Stewart either. I watch it's a Wonderful Life & Shenandoah & think he plays the part brilliantly and think him the best actor ever. Then I watch this & see him almost identical to most of his other roles, including the aforementioned ones. I get the same emotion watching Adam Sandler or Ross in Friends. They're drab & look like they need a good kick up the backside to put some emotion & ooomph into their lines.It was a great idea of a plot with a fantastic twist. I just got the feeling it could've been done a bit better, especially the second half.All that aside though, I'd still recommend this. It's got much of Hitchcocks brilliance in it, but just not as much as some of his other classics.7/10",7,0,4,29 December 2001
Requiem for a Dream," Not for me
","Normally when I dislike films, I launch a tirade of abuse about them, but that would be harsh on this, even though I couldn't stand it.The core of the actual story was good. It was everything else about it that was a problem, and everything in the film seemed too over emphasised.I've never taken any drug so I'll sit on the fence as to whether it was an accurate portrayal. It was however an irritating portrayal, by the end.
I'm in a minority with the Snatch & Fight Club style editing and cinematography in these films but I can't stand it. The split screens, slow motion, fast forwarding and even the music, although not complicating the film, just seem to serve to lessen the continuity and eventually irritate.Reqiuem for a Dream wasn't a long film, so couldn't really have been shortened. That created a problem in that any of: the Fridge moving, the cocaine being snorted, the mum on the TV show and lots more had all been flogged to death by the end. Each time I saw the face of, I think Washington? on the money I knew I could have a drink and look out the window for the next 30 seconds as nothing different would happen to the previous 10 times it was done.Again, I'm in a minority but I would have liked this film a little more if it was tackled in a more conventional manner ie without the fancy editing and graphic detail, as there was much promise with the story. On the plus side though, the acting was almost faultless.Rightly or wrongly, I Interpreted this as Anti-drug, even though the film never dictated that to the viewer. I don't shock easily, and found the drug snorting in Boogie Nights, far more graphic & off putting than here. But if this film prevents a few extra people from becoming an addict, I suppose it's served a purpose.I just don't get enthralled when drugs is the central point of a film. Not that that means I don't think they have a place or purpose in cinema. They do. You can't brush  it under the carpet. But people who've no time for football or golf, wouldn't get over pleasured from films on those themes, in the same way I don't on drug addiction.Finally, the last 10 minutes went a little over my head and any ideas what the name was of Tyrones girlfriend?3/10",3,2,5,21 February 2002
Raiders of the Lost Ark," I didn't like this film.
","I'm not going to spend much time on this as I am obviously in a massive minority by not liking it. It's taken me 20 years to finally see this film through to the end.It just bores me completely. It's a part James Bond film, which I've never had any time for. It doesn't seem any better than the 'Mummy' or 'Tomb Raider' type films (ZZZZZZ) where the dialogue is largely incidental & which you can watch with the volume turned down and still follow. They generally concern some pre-historic torch, urn, key, lump of dog turd, that has special powers, that the hero needs to get his hands on & that just doesn't make for an interesting film.I just cannot get into films like this & never have any interests whether they achieve what they're after. In this there were a lot of scenes which seemed to be filling in time. First the Nazi's had the initiative, then Jones, then back to the Nazi's again and this went on & on & on, to the point that it wasn't dis-similar from a Steven Seagal or Van Damme film. Apart from the obvious superior quality of acting in this, the fighting scenes were sometimes laughable.Karen Allen threw in some incredibly wooden acting in her cliched lines she was given. The 'I'm your partner' was almost cringe making.There seems an unwritten rule that you are not allowed to comment on Raiders of the Lost Ark without mentioning Star Wars for some reason. So I love Harrison Ford films, I like George Lucas & certainly don't dislike Spielberg. Thus, I have Star Wars as one of only a dozen films in my list at 10/10, it's almost perfect. I myself, wouldn't mention this in the same breath as Star Wars. You immediately feel a part of Star Wars & it's wonderful characters, neither of which apply here.This film has never taken off in England to the extent it has done in the US. I know plenty of adults who've never seen it & many who are not mad over it. But I'll admit I've never found anyone who genuinely dislikes it. Apart from me!3/10",3,29,68,14 January 2002
Casablanca," Dull & way overrated
","I'm not going to slate the film any more than that, as millions still love it now, so it must be me that's in the wrong, but it was such a hard film to watch.The acting was faultless. But that's it really. The ending going against typical Hollywood happy ones, is the only other praise I could give this.The 1st half hour or so of Casablanca wasn't bad at all & set up some fairly interesting premises. Likewise the last 15 minutes was an ending that still stands up well today. But the period between 30-75 minutes was 3/4 of an hour of chronic boredom. There was no character to connect to or like until the finale & what plot there was, was in no way enjoyable. Good cinematography, romance & Nazi's together seem to account for the popularity of this, but in reality it was poorly executed & lacked a plot that could hold the viewer's attention.There was too much dialogue sometimes & seemed an attempt to cram as many 'cool' lines into the film as possible. Some of them were good & fitted in well, but others, particularly 'here's looking at you kid' don't hold up well at all, & by the 3rd or 4th time, made you cringe.A 50 word review of the film makes it seem fairly straightforward. Granted, the main plot was, but I had real trouble understanding the sub-plots & relevance of some of the secondary events & storylines or characters.Though this wasn't an awful film at all & may go up a mark or two more with another viewing. But like Citizen Kane which I found far worse, it seems another one thats liked because it's been drummed into everyone for 50 years that it's a classic & so we're supposed to like it. But then what do I know, I'm just an ordinary bloke.3/10",3,24,53,18 April 2002
Citizen Kane," I tried so hard to like this
","I chose to watch this film solely because it was in the IMDB top 4, and with only one or two exceptions most of the top 20 are brilliant.My first two attempts at watching it saw me fall asleep after about 20 minutes. The third time I made myself not move until the end, and it couldn't have come soon enough. It really is the most boring film I have ever seen.There is no major criticism of this film, purely because it must be one of the few that are about absolutley nothing. OK it concerned somebody's political and media career, but then so have a thousand other TV shows and films. Are they really subjects interesting enough to warrant making any film about, let alone one as popular as this?It lacks any action, suspense, humour or anything else a film needs. You can turn your brain off for two hours to watch this drivel as you won't need it. That is nothing to do with it being from the 1940's or in black and white. So were The Wizard of OZ, And Then There Were None and Casablanca and they are all brilliant.I couldn't think of anything worse than a film being made today about Robert Maxwell or Rupert Murdoch's life. It would be as painfully dull and boring as this.2 out of 10.",1,9,33,25 February 2001
The Maze Runner," Lots of Running
","The film is full of running, lots of it and the characters barely break sweat at times.It never really felt like a film, more a TV show, where you watch the first two of eight hours. It would have been better making it apparent from the start, that there would be no real ending and it would lead to a further part.It was ok, a few good scenes, I stuck.with it, but it is a bit of a mess and full of cliches and inconsistencies. Too many of the residents seemed oddly content and at ease with being there, the female character served little purpose and how one of the characters who chose to stay in the camp, then miraculously ended up outside made no sense.5/10",5,1,2,31 July 2018
12 Monkeys," Bloody hard work
","reading the description of this film on the cover sends a chill up me, as it's sounds a plot for the ultimate film. Even having seen it & not enjoyed it, it still sounds an amazing concept. In reality, it was very poorly executed.I spent so much of the film re-winding the tape to clarify what was happening. I'm not saying it was complicated, but it required far more than 100% concentration. There must have been a better way of tackling time travel than this.My biggest problems with this were the characters & acting. Bruce looked totally uninterested in his role & just ambled about (almost Stallone esque) grunting & mumbling looking thoroughly bored & miserable. Madeline Stowe's character was your typical unconvincing screaming woman, Brad Pitt weren't in it enough & when he was (though not through bad acting) looked like he was in a school play in the role of a character thought up in 10 minutes.It seemed a film that deliberately tried to be awkward & complex thus to appeal to those who like to see themselves above everyone else in intelligence (but who very rarely are). It was also made for your 'sci-fi junkies and anyone who dislikes anything remotely mainstream.While I love your 'Back to the Future type films, I don't want all time travel films to be tackled like that. I like something a little more adult that requires more thinking & mystery. So, I should've liked this. Unfortunately, it just tried far too hard to be more complex.In any film you should be able to (in effect) place or imagine yourself in the role of one main characters.Sadly, there wasn't one single thing that Crowe done in Twelve Monkeys that any normal human, in his position, would've done. He never seemed to have any enthusiasm or rational ideas of how to convince anyone that he was from the future, barely made any references to having lived through the time period he was in, although this wasn't helped by him often being in a state barely able to speak. I never had an understanding of why Crowe was in prison in 2030 odd, infact only knew he was due to the cover of the video telling me. There was also the cliched 'No-one believes the main bloke's protests' characters, made out as baddies.The 1st half of the film in far too slow, it picked up a lot in the 2nd half (although I'd had a kip in between), but even the 2nd half was let down by an ending the viewer could peg, infact almost knew, way in advance and an end scenario that I couldn't help thinking could have been avoided given how much was known already? Maybe that's the point that, it was unavoidable, I don't know?Of the people that give this 10/10 I can't believe any 2 of them have the same interpretation of EXACTLY what went on, particularly what would've went on after the film ended. That's not necessarily a fault as I'm all for interpreting films in your own way. It does however leave films like this open to countless plot holes or chasms, especially when you have a film like Twelve Monkeys that seems to ask the viewer to suspend disbelief but at the same time contains a highly complex plot.I would've liked to have seen more time devoted to the future, at the start of the film, as we never seemed to have enough understanding of it as the film went on. It wasn't an awful film though. I give it 5/10 and usually with films of that score I have an equal amount of good & bad to say about it. Whilst this has good points, it's just a subject that could've been tackled so so much better, slightly more straight forward, with better acting, more likeable characters & with scenery & cinematography less dark & depressing, it looked almost post-apocalyptic in 1996.I would point fans of these films in the direction of the TV show Jonathan Creek as how highly complex stories can be tackled in a way that is both straightforward, but requiring intelligent thinking.I have only watched this once though. I reckon with one or two more viewings, little things will become clearer, lines I missed will be heard and I'll have a fuller grasp of it but I can't see it going up any more than another 2 marks.A low 5/10",5,2,11,4 April 2002
Mississippi Burning," Awesome
","I can't believe this film isn't in the Top 250 of all time. Apart from being brilliant, it's exactly the sort of powerful, full metal jacket type film that people love.As great as it was there were some sickening scenes. I lost count of the amount of times I thought to myself either 'thank god we don't live in a world like this anymore' or 'we're fortunate if the racists were based on real characters, that they'd probably be dead by now, or if not then not too far off it'.Every aspect of the segregation & bigotry was pathetic. I'm ashamed that this was as recent as one generation ago. I know racists are still in this world, but I can only see watching this film as being positive as having a positive bearing on the issue. It asks the question everyone has pondered on. Where does the hatred come from?Children will play and talk to anyone. Black, white, chinese, Jews, anyone. Unless they're manipulated, generally by adults (parents) or some form of media.The best thing with this film is that the public of Mississippi were shown to be absolute morons. The scene where the reporters questioned them, to which their replies were 'well they're different to us & don't wash' or anything that came out of the judges' gob, was so laughable, it wasn't worth taking seriously. So I can't see how anyone can question that the non FBI whites came out positively in this film.Great acting too from Dafoe, Hackman & McDormand.One previous commenter here, claimed that if you enjoyed this film you're a closet racist & as bad as the people in the film & the ones that made it. That's exactly the sort of imbecillic extremist comment & reason why the problem of racism will probably never be completely eradicated in our lifetimes.Fair enough, the FBI may have been seen as the heroes & problem solvers and not the black townfolk. I don't know US / Mississippi history well enough to comment on how accurate or factual that is, but I would guess that the truth was bent considerably and the negroes did far more for racial problems than this film suggests, but to label people racist for enjoying this film, is ignorant & childish.So people who enjoy films about drugs are all crack addicts eh? People who enjoy a film about drink driving or joyriding are as bad as them in the story? No. Hopefully they'd never consider doing any of the above after watching it & they'd have the brains to form their own opinions. OK, there'll always be one or two of the braindead who'd slip through the net, but most people would be ok.Just because you enjoy a film doesn't mean you're sitting there nodding your head in agreement & chuckling away throughout as if it's Airplane. There were scenes in this you could barely watch & made you ashamed & embarassed, but it kept your attention for over 2 hours, and that's what all great films do.9/10",9,5,7,2 January 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," As bad as the first film was good.
","Sums it up really. The first film was completely original & a refreshing change and while the sequel - indeed any sequel - by definition can never have that trait, they can at least retain some of the values of the first film.This was appalling drivel & I'm staggered so many have rated it as high as the first. What were you watching? Sparrow's character was one of the greatest in movie history. It was nothing here, he lacked any of the charisma or lines of the original and to paraphrase another critic here the 'seem like an honest man, tell lies, and really be honest at heart' characterisation was flogged to death. Knightley seemed far too cocky in her role and Bloom was given a lot of screen time for a plot which never bordered on interesting. Although the latter could've been avoided had they merely removed the entire 45 minute tribesman / island scene near the beginning which served absolutely no point to the rest of the film whatsoever.Whereas in the original the plot was simple & yet brilliantly effective this was a complete mess & merely a selection of incoherent & unnecessary scenes lumped together and seemingly decided on 1) how much they cost to film & 2) how loud they were as opposed to whether they added anything to the film at all.The target audience seemed completely different to the first. The original seemed to be written towards intelligent adults but with consideration to younger viewers. I mean no offence here, but I got the feeling 90% of this was aimed at the average three year old, bar the concept of Davy Jones which would be asking a bit for a 12 or 13 year old to take on board first time. If you'd gone more than a couple of minutes without a good line or scene (which it frequently did) throw in a few 'man gets hit on head with rock' or 'man trips over' gags & all will be forgotten. Granted in my cinema they got a few laughs, but they sounded like children's laughs in comparison to the original.I'd accumulated about 250 questions & points I was unsure of within the first half hour and while some were answered later on (too late usually - as you'd got past caring) the key points were usually glossed over so quickly, presumably so the plot holes & plot jumps were not questioned. Much of this was brought about by too many characters in the film as a whole, particularly early on.A good sequel IMO, is one where you imagine the original had never existed and this was it instead. Regardless of whether the plot is better or worse does it still offer the originality & core values of the first film. This never came close. The plot was dull & sacrificed for noise & effects & the characters had nothing likable about them. The major ones never evolved at all, the minor ones just recycled the same gags & lines from the first film, which were great then but not again.I still await the 3rd film with anticipation. There's every chance it could be another classic like the original, especially if they take on board the faults of this one. Lets hope Pirates of the Caribbean follows in the mould of Die Hard with two classic films at ever end, with a pointless one sandwiched between them.Sorry but 1/10 - no redeeming qualities at all.",1,15,27,8 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Ok but needed subtitles.
","Certainly the chunks of the film that were not in English could have done with subtitles. Orlando Bloom was the only one who seemed to speak clearly all the way through.A slightly below average film. A ok plot but with an ending you could clock from a mile away. The fighting scenes (which 99% of the time never interest me in any film) seemed particularly pointless here given that the enemy couldn't be killed.As said several times the two pairs -the 2 pirates & 2 guards (English too- there was a surprise) were pathetic characters. That was the biggest problem with the film it tried to be funny & failed and couldn't seem to make out whether it wanted to target itself at kids, adults or everyone. Consequently, with such a laid back plot, it became difficult to keep concentration with the plot, who was cursed, why, how etc etc.Still, it was an ok story, had some good scenes, kept me reasonably interested and was acted well.5/10",7,0,1,23 September 2003
Happy Gilmore," ...and Sandler's still not funny.
","After 5 films now. I only watched this as it came on TV & I couldn't find the remote to turn it over or be bothered to get up.However, whereas the humour content in his other films are 'absolutely nil' this was just 'nil' so I suppose it was his funniest I've seen to date.I know it was only a film but the lack of golfing knowledge by the writers shone through more than anything. Countless errors & ignorance of rules. Nor can I take any film seriously where the lead character is called 'Happy' and the golfing pro is called 'Shooter'. Also Sandler again unrealistically pulled a gorgeous woman, despite the hinderance of him being a right prat which seems to go unnoticed amongst the women in his films. All of that I could've put up with though.
Unfortunately however, he AGAIN managed to irritate beyond belief with his usual trait, ie his idea of comedy consisting entirely of talking in a slow gormless voice. Somebody needs to tell him this mimic of a slow learner which crops up in all his films, ceases to be funny when the viewer reaches 3 year old.Despite all that though I saw it through to the end, without wanting to vomit (except the scenes mentioned above) & I remained interested, so for that: 4/10",4,1,6,1 March 2002
Madagascar," Awful
","I tend to go one of two ways, with the endless crop of animated films we get each year: either loving them or hating them. But even by the standards of the ones I've previously disliked Madagascar was truly awful. So much so, I cannot think of a single redeeming quality it had to offer anyone over the age of three.The initial scenes in the zoo offered a possibility of a slightly interesting concept but from the second the plot veered towards finding the wild via Connecticut (another instance of where we're all supposed to know the location of a minor U.S state despite living 4,000 miles away) what plot there was, was painful.This was the first animated film I've seen that did not further the genre one iota. The characters had nothing about them to like, did not develop in the slightest throughout the film. The film got stuck in a real mess for the middle 30 minutes or so and was nothing more than filler. The characters in the wild couldn't hold any interest at all, the central animals seemed to alter their personalities at will with once Alex & Marty - I had to check those names as they was amazingly forgettable - going from loving to hating each other during one snippet of Chariots of Fire on the beach. Giraffes have never worked in any concept least of all a film like this. Most of the intended laughs here were presumably through the smut.But the biggest problem Madagascar had was trying to work out where the laughs were. I've no idea, I never came close to even a snigger. What few grunts there were in my cinema were from the usual sources: attempts at disco dancing, falling over, things hitting them on the head or crashing into trees. As I said, nothing that hasn't been flogged to death a million times before and it must have taken all of three seconds to come up with the entire list of jokes in this.I'm sorry, but as many critics here have said, this is by some margin the worst film of this genre you will see in a long time, and I cannot think of one thing it offers anyone of any age. The writers need to watch Toy Story or Chicken Run to see how you write a film to appeal to all ages, even children.",1,18,31,15 July 2005
Ted," 7.2/10??? What on earth do people see in this? It's 200 Farts & a car chase.
","Ted - 200 Farts & a car chase. Utterly woeful 1/10 Meant to watch it last night but got too late. Ended up flicking through to find the Confessions of Plumbers Mate & Driving Insructor on Movies 24. Dreadful films, as bad as you can get and the IMDb ratings of 2.5 /10 is generous, but was keeping an eye out for Robert Lindsay, Elaine Paige and Biggins.The single one thing you take for granted when you watch a film & a British 70s tawdry sex comedy was the previous flick you've seen 24 hours earlier is that it's some sort of improvement. This had the unique achievement of being even worse.It's just truly woeful. I cannot overemphasise just how dreadful this film is & I grew up through the 80s and loved them. The supposed jokes (and I use the term extremely loosely) are futile, just farts, f*cks & wank1ng, characters completely uninteresting and who you never give a toss about & little if any plot.Two or three scenes are so cringingly bad you wonder how they ever were even suggested. The restaurant scene where he brushes away a fart and the three businessman create a fuss must have been penned by a five year old. The Flash Gordon scenes were dreadful, the entire kidnapping plot line and the Dad & child should have been removed completely.Wahlberg said he wished he got Teddy Ruxpin for Christmas instead. So do I, I'd happily have watched that & spared me the 100 minutes lost watching this cringingly amateurish, painful drivel.Easily in the worst 10 of my 800+ ranked films and beneath Robin Askwith & his chums and doesn't deserve the 1/10.",1,20,36,20 January 2013
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," I usually hate these films
","Womens films, about people relationships. The subject doesn't interest me on or off the screen. But this was good. Not great but good.Not a great deal to say on it. Excellent idea for a basis of a romantic plot, some of it works very well, some is pretty run-of-the-mill clichÃ©d stuff. But it does have some funny scenes which most recent romantic so called comedies have neglected and keeps you guessing right until the end.Any one with a hint of a brain cell can work out they'll end up together but you never know exactly how it will come about without one of them breaking their agreement.When it arrives the end is in truth a let down & could have been executed with the two plots coming together better. Kate Hudson - though gorgeous seemed (and indeed is) to young for the role she was given, but that apart as good a romantic comedy film as I've seen since the millennium.A low 7/10",7,4,6,2 January 2005
Hot Fuzz," 7/10 but surprised by the praise.
","7/10 for this one. Staggered though to find it in the top 150 of all time.Not so much because I didn't rate it that high - more it just doesn't strike me as the sort of film so many others would, especially on a worldwide basis.I cannot see the logic in putting the success down to British fans / humour though - given the average rating for U.S voters is 8.4 but non U.S is only 8.1.Unlike others, I actually preferred the early segments of Hot Fuzz. I'd agree little happened of any note, just setting up the latter plot but it always remained an interesting scope on country life.I found it as much a take on Midsomer Murders as American cop shows.On the plusses, the supporting cast were all terrific, some very good characters and a great take on English country life and Frost played the role brilliantly and convincingly.The other coppers were a mixed mag, the uniformed ones were all super, the female cop arguably the best character in the film, brilliantly scripted and played out.But the two detectives for me, never even bordered on likable or amusing and their character change near the end was far too much of a bolt out of the blue.Not so much negatives but minor criticisms - on reflection I didn't actually find many if any laugh out loud gags. It never stopped being pleasant, enjoyable or mildly humorous, but to hear some talking of side-splitting laughter, don't be fooled into thinking this is Airplane, Four Weddings or Monty Python & the Holy Grail. I actually preferred Shaun of the Dead by maybe one mark to this with the similar-ish gags funnier first time time round.The shoot-out scene at the end seemed to get a little lost. For the main part it had a touch of the A-Team with shootings, violence from distances where you couldn't miss but nobody actually getting killed which didn't fit with the film as a whole where there was plenty of gory deaths.But all in all, well worth a look. You won't find too many films better written or as unique & enjoyable as Hot Fuzz.",7,0,1,8 August 2007
The Others," Ok
","Spoilers Within4 of us watched this. The other 3 couldn't stand it & ripped it to pieces. I thought it was quite good, but am aware of what was wrong with it.But to call the ending a surprise is way over the top. There are only really 6 characters in it so the choice was either: none of them are dead, some of them are or they all are, so it was no surprise for me, so don't expect the ending to come as that much of a shock.The other criticism which I agreed somewhat with was that it took an awful long time to get to the point & not a lot happened along the way to get there. It was always watchable but at occasional point not exciting and could've done with being 10 minutes less.On the plus side though, the young girl stole the show with a brilliant performance & Eric Sykes chipped in with a good role.Unlike other films like this, I didn't find any major flaws or even minor ones. With the knowledge of the end, the early scenes all still work, as far as I know. The one grey area was the locking the doors. I failed to see the real relevance of it & don't know whether they were being locked really or not. I doubt it, but am not sure.Whilst I found the ending no great surprise I thought it was a good ending & well done. But I would still describe it as 'An Ending' rather than 'The Ending.' There were many other avenues they could have gone down with the plot which would've worked too.But overall, pretty good7/10",7,2,3,10 May 2002
Ed Wood," Fairly good
","Not a bad film. It probably over emphasised the point slightly by the end, but was still enjoyable. It was an interesting film without ever being fascinating or at all exciting, but I certainly feel better & a little more knowledgeable for having watched it. I knew nothing of Ed Wood before I watched it and although I will certainly keep an eye out for his films now, I'll keep an open mind on how realistic a portrayal this was, as I've no idea. There were times this seemed more like a documentary or a programme on the History Channel, than a film, not necessarily a bad thing.
Whilst a completely different type of film from Citizen Kane there were still similarities and I thought this was 10 times the film CK was. It was likeable in plot & character, not to any great extent, but still more than Kane.6/10",6,1,5,10 March 2002

","Brilliant family film, hat still stands the test today, Culkin was very good, and the film had everything from laughs to action to some moving scenes.Unlike the latter films, whilst much of this is of course unrealistic, it still manages to keep the right side of plausible and you never feel anything is too ridiculous.If it had one fault, the scene where the cop banged on the door, could've been rewritten much better, but otherwise it's a classic.I wouldn't touch the next 3 in the series, but this was outstanding and can be enjoyed by everyone from 4 years old to 104.",8,0,1,15 December 2012
L.A. Confidential," Above average, but not by much
","Much as I love reading I'm not into fictional novels as I've given up on people taking 12 pages to get down the stairs or 2 page descriptions of a biro. The benefit is being able to watch a film (a) without comparing it to the book, thus risking being disappointed & (b) not knowing how it ends, so I've no comment on the adaptation.As for the film, yes it was fairly good, but no classic & certainly overated. I've seen very little film noir but what I have are predominately modern day attempts (Man Who Wasn't There) and I've yet to really enjoy one, as the cinematography & mood often seem more important than a plot, and that happened here to a degree.The story was really hard work to follow. Not through being complicated but that you had to focus on every word & if you missed a single second you were lost. I don't mind corruption in police storylines even though it's been flogged about for years now, but I've seen it done better & more interestingly than here.There were plusses though. Great acting from Crowe & DeVito with Spacey & Pearce in good performances. But the less said about Basinger the better. I'm staggered she won an oscar. She wasn't in it a great deal, had very few lines and when you did see her she was shagging or being slapped. You can fast forward her scenes.Once the film gets going it's one of the most realistic portrayals of a decade from a Hollywood movie, ever. There's also a few thought provoking social issues thrown up, one or two excellently done, violent scenes, a great intro and some good all round action but sadly interspersed with a handful of meaningless & dull scenes that make the plot a bit stop-start.I just couldn't ever fully connect with any of the characters to love this film, which I never seem to be able to do with the darkness of Film Noir.A low 7/10",7,9,19,21 January 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Dull
","Lots of noise, lots of people shouting 'fire' (then shouting 'fire' again and again), lots of people swinging from one boat to another - and then back to the boat they were on in the first place (just stay where you are) lots of people double crossing or backstabbing lots of other people to the point of absurdity, lots of Mackenzie Crook's eye falling out, lots of money spent, lots of people going 'awwww' every time the monkey picked up a gun, a hat or did anything, lots of needless characters who need not be there and lots of - at best- mediocre acting from an ill-looking, wooden Knightly. Not much else though.I feel for the idiot responsible for putting the opening scene together: A 'Family Film' beginning with rows of people being executed & bodies slung in one mass pile, one of which is a child. The misjudgement of that decision, only forgotten due to the bigger cock-up, namely that the child had a 21st century brace in his teeth!On the plusses, it was still better than the second one, though hardly an achievement, and we were the ONLY 2 of 500 in the cinema, who saw that Elizabeth and Will had a child and who he was, which seemed a bit odd for bigger fans of the film than me to be so desperate to get out and miss the last two minutes & the whole conclusion.",3,3,9,27 May 2007
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Two legends
","Two wonderful characters played out by two equally wonderful actors. Sadly the film wasn't as wonderful but was still a good watch and holds up well today.You can't help but like them and cheer them along the way like with Billy the Kid in Young Guns. But with these two they still strike you as being good guys at heart.The film was let down by a poor soundtrack which must have took up about 20 minutes all in all. The Katherine Ross character didn't seem to fit into the story either.But that apart, with some brilliant scenes, I'd still recommend this film, for two legends, characters or actors.7/10",7,1,3,26 April 2002
Blade II," Luke Goss
","I've never seen the interest or fascination in anything to do with vampires: Buffy, Angel & the many many films I just can't get into to, even when I was a kid. I'm not sure why exactly. By definition, they're a little too dark & fantasy like for me, but (& probably wrongly) I've always seen them as made for younger people.Through chance I've happened to see both Blade 1 & 2 though & they've been pretty much what I'd imagined beforehand. Not bad films at all & pretty straightforward to follow, but with a suspension of belief needed obviously.Blade 2 was marginally better than the 1st one. Some very good action scenes & cinematography & Snipes, Kristoffesen & happily Luke Goss (who deserves some good luck) all make this film worth watching. There's nothing wrong with the plot either, but it's just not the sort of topic that interests me.A high 4/10",4,1,4,25 April 2002
Alien," Dull dull dull
","Got to go against everyone here, but another outdated Scott film which left me bored.It took too long to get going, was very cliched but worst of all had no character to warm to at all. Infact it was probably a collection of every type of negative characteristic in people somewhere in someone in this film.A good ten minutes of this film is wasted on not one but two scenes of people searching for a cat. After the tedium of that the attempts to scare was usually in the form of a big bang.Weaver's hardly in it until the last half hour & when she is she comes across as an unconvincing hero(ine). There's little charcter development with her or anyone.As my concentration wained things became a little confusing. I must've missed the explanation of why there was cat on the ship, or what went on at the end with the 5 minute count down to override the ship (when she was trying to escape). Despite all the ammunition there was a amazing lack of enthusiasm to use the gun & on an alien who we never really got to see that clearly.I enjoyed 'Sphere' of all films as I got into the plot and could play along with the mystery, so thought I'd give this a go as it was recommended by more than one correspondant. Unfortunately, not only was there no real suspense or horror in this. There was nothing to entice the viewer to engross themselves in the plot.3/10",4,8,26,26 February 2002
Ant-Man," Alright I Suppose
","For a comic book or Superhero file, neither of which I can usually bear, it was surprisingly ok. It kept the nonsense to a minimum and had a good amount of day to day life in the story which kept it appealing.It was that good, I would happily watch the sequel, which I have never felt about one of these films before.6/10",6,1,1,1 January 2019
Fargo," Good(ish)
","A good film but certainly not one worthy of 10/10.It's a good & interesting story, I just can't worship the film like others as it was slow in places, had a main group of characters who though well acted, were all irritating & dislikeable to a degree. That's not a criticism of the film, after all, it was an attempted true account of real life incidents, but for all the exceptional camerawork & scenery, the plot just wasn't strong enough to carry an entire 100 minute film, but ignoring the occasional scenes that served little purpose it was otherwise good.7/10",7,0,0,16 March 2002
American Pie," Pretty good
","I scored this film 7 / 10 & am quite chuffed to see it's overall rating is 7.0. Thus, I must be fairly representative of the audience on this one.I'll start however, with the one and only real criticism I had of this film. It was about as funny as a road accident. It was entertaining, easily to follow, had likeable characters, a surprisingly good storyline, but to describe it as a comedy must contravene every trade description law in the book.To hear people rave about how hilarious this film was, you'd think it was Airplane or Naked Gun. It's not in that league, at least insofar as a comedy film. It could be another classic example of the American / Australian idea of comedy being completely different to Europe's & vice versa, as I watched this, though thoroughly enjoying it, completely straight faced throughout. Much in the same way, many Brits do with 'Cheers'. Extremely good lighthearted entertainment, but not particularly amusing.I must also have watched an edited version as I cannot believe the emphasis people place on the character Stifler. Apart from the incident in the toilet, I recall very little else of him. He wasn't part of the pact after all.Other than that though, it was good. I tend to avoid films with the first word 'American' like I avoid warts, as I do with so called sex comedies, given the amount of crap that come out of England in the 70's, in this genre, so this film was a recipe for diaster with me, but I really did enjoy it.I anticipated a shagfest of pre pubescent teens making crude jokes, (especially given the pathetic knob in apple pie scene played to death in the trailers), and a glamourising of teenage sex, to make it seem like the be all & end all of every teenagers life, when most will tell you it isn't & that they do have other interests. But it wasn't really that at all, infact, for large parts the tone was to the contrary, I'm sure it conveyed some positive messages.So for mild light hearted entertainment, I'd certainly recommend this. It's good fun, but not in the 'ha ha' sense.But one thing, please, all in the US & Hollywood. Can this be the last film or song that you export, even just for a year, where the whole story revolves around 'Prom Night'? We've had enough of them for a while. Nobody else has Prom Nights. Us in England have never been to one, and don't really have any idea what they are. We don't export films about fat northern compere's in stringed vests & strippers on stage in Working Mens Clubs.",7,1,2,9 December 2001
The Italian Job," Very Good
","Possible spoilers. Not much to say on this one. Very good & enjoyable & the time flies by. Lost 2 marks for the ridiculously cliched group they were. I read the preview of this film (before knowing who was in it) about how Wahlberg works in a gang of 5 thieves. I knew immediately then, exactly who would make up the group: An Englishman, a black man, a nerdy computer geek, a gorgeous woman & a back stabber who does the dirty on them. What do you know? The token Englishman, black man, computer geek, woman & Grass are the 5. They could have been really daring and had all 5 in the one category for novelty, but still that's Hollywood. But credit where it's due, all the lead characters are exceptionally well written & good value.I've know idea why this film was called the Italian Job. It seemed to bear as many similarities to Zulu or Ghostbusters as it did the original Italian Job, but put that aside & (and bearing mind I can't stand action films generally) you'll enjoy a terrific film, well worth a watch.A low 8/10.",8,0,1,15 October 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," very good
","The reviews have said everything there is to say, so briefly, LOTR had just about everything in a film you could ask for, barring the laughing out loud humour, which it didn't need anyway & the time went be relatively quickly.It's certainly not deserving as it's position of No2 of all time though. It lost marks for being a little too long, for being a stand alone film & a tiny bit too fantasy/sci-fi for my own enjoyment. I've never touched any Tolkien, or even fantasy book in my time, but I prefer it that way, as I had no idea in the slightest what was coming next or indeed will do.But all in all one of the best films in years & possibly my favourite 'Epic' or battle film ever & I'll be in the queue for the sequel.A high 8/10",5,0,0,9 February 2002
North by Northwest," Great Hitchcock
","Probably my favourite of the Hitchcock films I've seen to date, over Psycho, Dial M & Vertigo.Cary Grant's just brilliant as Roger. One of the most convincing & faultless pieces of acting you'll ever see, superior to James Stewart, in Hitchcock roles.I had problems with the casting though, not the acting or characters, they were all brilliant, but Cary was 54 when this was made, by my reckoning, yet played someone half that age, his Mum was a few months younger than him & Eve seemed far older than the character she played, which she was.
Ignoring Cary Grant's grey hair which slightly belittled his role & two or three aspects of criminal behaviour which don't really hold up in today's world, (why didn't the villains drive past in a car & shoot rather than a plane?) and a story dragged on 10 or 15 minutes too long, it's still a pretty awesome film with the usual superb acting, music & cinematography you expect from Hitchcock, but also with some amusing humour thrown in.8/10",8,1,2,5 March 2002
American Beauty," It was the Eastenders Christmas Special of 1986 in film.
","Don't get me wrong I did not hate this film. But to bracket in the top 10 of all time and to mention it in the same breath as Star Wars, Shawshank Redemption etc is a pathetic travesty. Where do I start?Spoilers The Film is about a middle aged drug taker running around after a girl young enough to be his grand daughter, a couple constantly arguing non stop, a teenage daughter who doesn't get on with her parents etc etc - all of which you'll find in any episode of any second rate soap opera. i don't hear people raving about 'the message' in them.It's the old 'Dead Poets Society' all over again. People trying to impress others by pretending to enjoy the 'deep hidden meaning' behind the film. Statistically, that can't be true. In reality we live in a world where the public are so stupid they chase pediatricians out of their home because they get the word muddled up with paedophiles. That many people are not that clever.I appreciate I have never been to America, so have little idea whether that reflects US reality, but in England (and maybe everywhere else) it doesn't wash at all.I just don't see 'so much beauty everywhere I look'. Where I go, I see muggings, assaults, filthy run down council estates that haven't had the rubbish collected for 6 months, and trains not fit for rodents and this is in one of the most popular cities in the world.Like Pulp Fiction, this film assumes we have an insatible desire for drug and sex storylines. OK some people do, but lots don't. I also happened to find the daughter more attractive than her friend. The rest of the cast, admittedly excellent actors, were an incredibly weird group of people, and the tough ex army bloke who hates gays and then turns out to be one? Do me a favour. So to the stereotypical teenage blonde girl.I'll admit to not always being clever enough to find meanings in films, but then I am one of the few people who really couldn't care less whether a film has a hidden message or not. I want to turn my brain off when I sit down to watch a film. I just want a beginning, middle and end.I wouldn't be able to tell you the entire meaning behind Shawshank Redemption, The Great Escape or any of the other great films there are. I just wish others would admit the same instead of trying to show off by pretending to understand and by making a lot more of films than what the writer intends. Exactly the same way people do with poetry. After all, this was a storyline that almost everyone would have encountered in their life.I dread to think what these sort of people would make of me if they scrutinised my every move. Despite all of that, as I said the film was ok and had nothing majorly wrong with it. Just don't expect it to be anywhere near the standard of any others in the IMDB top 10.4or5 out of 10.",2,3,5,22 January 2001
Wanted," What the hell was that?
","By some considerable margin the worst film I have ever seen and my first one star since about 2002 - and only 1 because '0' isn't an option.It is a complete mess from the first scene, they even have to whack up some background info about th origins of the fraternity 1000 years ago which you learn effectively translates as 'we've made up some nonsense, won't make much sense but basically anything can now happen no matter how utterly implausible it will be.' The first third of the film is a simple enough insight into McEvoys everyday life, interspersed with the most banal, excruciatingly pathetic slow-mo's, editing and special effects (and I use the term 'special' in the loosest possible sense) and from then on, it goes downhill once the fraternity get involved.Freeman looks completely bored with his role, Jolie is woeful in a role I've seen her in at least three times before and ample reason to turn it off. By about 2/3 of the way through, you got the impression they realised they had another hour to cram into 20 minutes - the transformation of McEvoy from someone having seven bells beaten out of him to wanting to learn the minutiae of his father and the fraternity seemed to be about 15 seconds - and this a father he never even knew half a day earlier.The plot and the rules seemed to be made up as they go along, I've no idea where any of the passengers disappeared to on the train carriage as it hung from the track. You get to a point where you suspend disbelief so much, no more so than the absurd car chases, that it was 'anything goes' - anything can be done, slowed down, somersaulted over, flown through - never mind, it's only a film.But a dire one.",1,2,5,23 July 2011
Spider-Man," Above average but only slightly
","Spiderman started off pretty well & had the makings of a good film but too much time was devoted to the romance as the film went on.I'd have liked a little more insight into Peter at the start before the biting but more than that, the start of Peters' / Spidermans' mission to help the public was glossed over far too quickly. One minute he was looking at the costume, within seconds it was days later & the city all knew about him. I'd have liked Spiderman to have been a little more comic book style like Superman, but nonetheless it's still a good film with some great scenes (and gaffes).A low 7/10",7,0,0,21 May 2002
Independence Day," Brilliant
","Great film.If we are to continue to get, what many term 'Hollywood movies', either make them completely realistic, without any innacuracies, or go to the other extreme and make them unrealistic. Namely, go the whole hog, like this, and quite often, like this, it is brilliant.Don't pussy foot around like Forrest Gump & Sixth Sense do, where half the time you feel you're watching something genuine whilst the other half it's a complete farce.Yes there's errors & much of this would never occur in real life, but films like this are to entertain the public, which it does. I'd rather have films where one or two scientific facts are ignored, than actual & entire historical occurences being manipulated or reconstructed as you get in crap like Braveheart, The Patriot & even dare I say it #3 Schindlers List.I dislike an awful lot about America, as I often remark, but realistically if this film concentrated on every country involved in a worldwide battle it would've lasted about 3 days.People also read too much into the plots of these sort of films. Armageddon and even Tomb Raider the plots are completely incidental. There's basically a lot of fighting, bombing or some sort of action going on, normally to save the world from a villain, darkness, aliens etc & whether it's finding the other half of a coin, blowing up a meteor or anything else I couldn't care less. I never feel a part of the film as we all know how it will end & don't really have any interest in how it comes to that as long as there's some good action.But this was far better than any of that. It was really easy to feel a part. You could also let your mind wander & visualise what it would be like to be caught up in that sort of thing. The speech by the president was moving, so was the bloke giving his life, especially given recent incidents in the US.One reviewer complained of there not being enough emphasis on developing characters, but really who cares? Two hours later once the film has ended, it doesn't matter. This was principally a battle by soldiers & scientists to save the world, nothing more, so why spend time finding out what Jeff Goldblum's character was really like away from work?Of course we'll never see the day a President or leader fights at the front of a battle, but just imagine WE were that leader. I bet we'd all like to think we'd be different & would get involved. So, we can at least hope it may one day happen.9/10",9,0,2,10 December 2001
Days of Thunder," Yep. Top Gun but cars.
","Spoilers withinThis is everything in Top Gun with cars replacing planes. All you need to know is that it's Tom Cruise playing a racing car driver & you can peg the entire plot, every bit of it. Even when it was made it was so cliched, you've got (1)driver (Cruise) as 'playboy', (2)other good driver made out as enemy, (3)lead with 'cool' name (they're never just called John Brown or even David Coulthard, (4)romance with woman gorgeous yet single? (this in Nicole's pre talent days) (5)Driver crap at start & threatened with sack (6)Driver has accident, career threatened (7) Car owner / Head Mechanic with a previous grievance to bear. Oh & of course (8) The victory at the end & everything else falls into place.I seem to be different to others but being a sports lover I prefer my sport to be ... er ... sport and not through a film. Any sport, motor racing included gives you all the tension & emotion you need from it and 10 times more than any film can ever do, so I don't know why directors bother with films such as this.But despite the plot that you can peg, even before the credits open at the start & Cruises cringing line near the end 'He's goin down' or something, it's still watchable. You can nip off at various points for 10 minutes here & there & still follow what's going on and has some good racing scenes & scenery.4/10",4,3,5,12 March 2002
Bridesmaids," Really good film
","Surprising in several ways how much I enjoyed this, expecting it to be a film for a female but it was far from that, in fact to the contrary it with much emphasis on a dry humour it was probably more suited to a male audience.It was pleasantly refreshing to see, in the main, a more written based comedy rather than the simple visual and crude masturbation type gags of Hangover & the In Betweeners. I had to check a couple of times on the level of English imput into this film, as the style of humour was unlike anything I'd seen out of the States and after too many attempts to count have probably laughed more than three times at a film from outside of the UK or Australia for the first time since Airplane.It's not to that standard, but can be applauded for at least half a dozen genuinely funny scenes, good characters and further refreshing to see it written by females. One of the criticisms, if any were that having watched the additional/deleted scenes there were several that probably warranted a place in the film and would have improved it.7/10 is extremely low, given some of the recent films that pass as comedy on a rating closer to 8. This was certainly that.",9,1,4,1 January 2012
Meet the Fockers," Ridiculously over the top
","Ridiculously over the top characters ruined this. The first film was OK, and while the acting talent & occasional laugh (in the looser sense - more a snigger) saved this film from being a complete disaster it was still pretty awful.The Hoffman & Striesand characters were pathetic, they seemed to be scribbled together at the last moment & made up as the film went along & were inconsistent. It was as if, they had to come up with as diverse as possible characters to the opposite parents, but they never came across as that, just two idiots.The child was especially irritating & never likable, the animals seemed only there for some childish gags, the scene with the truth drug was absurd and cringeworthy, only DeNiro's character had any substance and thought behind it, and while very good - even he was over the top.I never grasped why he had so much influence over the grandson, where the parents were & whether their schooling methods on their son were identical. While it was merely for a laugh in a comedy film, the methods at times seemed more suited to the Fockers.The rest of it was cheap knob & sex gags which were more cringing than funny, which summed up most of the film. 3/10.",3,3,5,31 December 2007
28 Days Later...," For a while it verged on brilliant.
","Maybe spoilers.For just over the first half of this film, it was on course to be one of the best I've ever seen. The script & idea were awesome and it was one where your mind could wander off and you could place your self in the lead role which is the sign of any good film.Unfortunately, the the plot moved onto the army scenes, the film degenerated into a bit of a farce. In all the post apocalyptic films & TV shows I've seen, it seems there's an unwritten rule that nobody can get on with each other after wards & consequently you end up with more deaths than the cause of the apocalypse. Quite why every member of the army had to be killed off I'm not sure.The acting wont win any awards but I don't let the acting quality affect my view of a film like other seems to. With so much crap soap operas on tele in England, you get immune to acting like that so it's not a problem. The acting here was competent, nothing more, but not enough to ruin a film.The film could've carried on an extra 10 minutes to let you know who was flying the plane, where they come from where they were going etc etc.The idea of post apocalyptic films is the most exciting there is as there is no right or wrong to it, but as of yet I've still yet to see one where the characters resemble how you or I would behave in that situation, and this, to a degree was similar. Nobody seemed to ask the questions any rational people would. For the lead girl character, who had much of the film, you knew very little about her.In short, it starts brilliantly, tails off badly in the second half, picks itself up again at the end but not enough to make it a classic.But nevertheless, I've seen about 10 films at the cinema in the last 2 months & this was comfortably the best. That's more through the others all being crap (Signs, Greek Wedding, Guru, Changing Lanes, Austin Powers etc). It's better than all of them & well worth a watch.7/10",7,0,0,9 November 2002
Paranormal Activity," Very disappointing
","Couldn't help feeling very let down & disappointed after seeing this.It sets itself up OK and a few aspects of it work quite well, unfortunately it suffers from a couple of fundamental flaws, the main one being that it is a horror/scary film which isn't the slightest bit scary. I can be scared quite easily, even by the odd mainstream thriller, probably even a 15 certificate in the past.Not finding it scary is one thing, but having watched this on DVD and not in the cinema, I struggled to see where the scary parts would even have been - those which caused cinema-goers to walk out.The disappointment is exacerbated as there is the basis of a good film. the set-up & cinematography are good, the mood it sets works for much of the film. Broadly speaking the plot works but when you break it down by segments it is pitiful at times.The first 10 mins, has the similarities of a porn film, with the dialogue & filming of the girl, the next 10 the start of a Derek Acora ghost watch show. You could accept a slow 20 mins if it was setting itself up for something better than you got.Unfortunately it then takes a turn for the even worse, as their behaviour becomes completely irrational and both characters become increasingly frustrating and idiots at times - 80% of which is the boyfriend who ends as one of the daftest characters in a long time. It could've still worked without that.The police, or somebody would've been called in with all that evidence at least 3 or 4 nights beforehand, someone else, a relative would've been consulted, brought in to stay or if they were remotely normal, to have taken them away and surely it was only a question of time before the bailiffs turned up to evict a couple from a mansion, one of which is a student and the others a day trader who struggled to amass an hours work in 6 weeks.The final problem is that the film has a catch 22 issue throughout. Whiilst the laptop each night, works very well throughout and always remains plausible, the video camera never does. It is used for the most pointless of scenes, or dialogue with no relevance whatsover to the demons and despite the girls' protestations to turn it off, it is ignored by an increasingly puzzling and unrealistic boyfriend, but then had he have done, there wouldn't have been another hour of footage.",3,0,1,13 June 2011
Mission: Impossible II," Bloody hard work
","Spoilers withinAdmittedly, when I watched this film, it was late & I was absolutely knackered, thus it had to be paused at least 3 times for the missus to explain what was going on, as it went way over my head.I was somewhat surprised therefore to see reviewers complain of a tedious, weak plot. I agree with the many though that have said it was boring. This wasn't an awful film, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it.As gorgeous as the female lead was, the romance was ridiculous.Also, like so many films, it seemed to be all about the big, high budget finale & one or two other interspersed scenes with some fancy fighting. For the other 75% of the film though, very little went on, it seemed the plot (and I use the term plot in the loosest possible sense) was just plonked in without much thought, just as a prelude for the next stunt scene.Yes, the stunts were impressive, amazing even, but anyone with half a brain knew exactly how it'd all end up. It was just a case of waiting for it. Wait we did. It must've taken 30 minutes just to close the story off & even the missus (who enjoyed it far more than me) had lost the will to live about 20 minutes from the end.I also find films where people takes others faces off & swap them with there own very tedious. Had it just happened in the one scene on the plane at the start, it might just have been ok. But it had been repeated half a dozen times by the end, so you spend the rest of the film wasting your time wondering who is actually doing the speaking & missing the lines, as I obviously did. You half expected Tom Cruise to reach for a gun, only to peel off an outer layer of plastic & find it's an aubergine, it got that silly.I spent years doing A-Levels & a degree, trying every method know to man to stay awake, while reading theories & attempting to store information in my head. Once those days are gone, you don't want go through it again, taking in spy films, where the characters are unlikely to mean anything to you.Had this story been told by an old uncle or grandad & condensed down into 10 minutes, it may possibly have been interesting, but beyond that, it's just not really a story worthy of a 2 hour film.Having slated it though, it's not awful. I've seen far worse films & one or two stunts are watchable in moderation, but in a time where nothing seems beyond stuntman & film crews, the days of making the audience go 'whoooah' are gone.4/10",3,0,0,17 December 2001
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," As dreadful as the first film was brilliant
","Home Alone was brilliant, an absolute classic, suitable for the entire family.This was absolutely dreadful and suitable for 15 year olds and little else.Home Alone retained elements of realism and you always felt that Kevin's sole intention was protecting his home. Nothing more than that and the traps were amusing ones.In Home Alone 2, every stunt, trick or booby trap (be it Kevin or Harry) bordered on either the absurd or the sadistic. Add to that the entire airport episode was too nonsensical to take seriously.Rolling some marbles to cause two men to fall in the street you can laugh off & ignore once, but they were numerous. Hurling bricks from a top of a building at somebody, setting fire to them, filling toilets up with petrol, wasn't funny, was a little uncomfortable to watch with children, who equally found no fun in it at all.You could make a decent argument that Kevin was actually the sadistic one in this film & could quite easily have shopped them to the Police instead of luring them to the house.Then they'd have been no film, which in hindsight would've been a blessing.I'll stick with the original from now on, which was immaculately written in the main, rather watch that twice in a row than this again.",4,1,3,15 December 2012
The Happening," Horrendous
","The review would usually reflect a 1/10 film. I only give it more as it was an interesting premise, started off ok and kept me fully intrigued and guessing throughout.But that was alway in the knowledge, that it was horrendous as film and as a story. The actors looked completely bored and uninspired throughout and as if they did not really have a clue what was happening either. It has also dated so quickly as a film amd.could pass as a film from the 1980's, although it looked like they attempted a Hitchcock style.It made little if any sense. A few of the people in the opening scenes, did not seem to be affected by the virus, when all rounds them were, but that never went anywhere. The attacks all seemed to stop in a perfectly straight line down the entire U.S but nobody was able to get through the line. I never really understood the exact number of people that need to be in the group to make it safe or unsafe and how group of people are all affected and another group in the same field, were not.",4,0,0,31 July 2018
The Fountain," Way over my head.
","I'm not ashamed to admit, despite a degree I'm not best suited to films with deep hidden meanings & what are commonly called 'arty-farty types' but despite trying hard with this, I don't believe anybody can claim that they 'got it' (for want of a better phrase) in the same way nobody really 'got' Twin Peaks.There was a range of problems here, most noticeably the promotional advertising, as this film is not really a love story in the traditional sense and it certainly is not in the time-travel genre - it is merely spread over three eras.There is an uneven amount of time allocated to the three timelines and though the modern day one is the easiest to follow, it never brings you in. It's very claustrophobic - the lab, the hospital - there's never a sense of where they are and the outside world. There's a lot of overacting from the ensemble cast and an entire range of characters you never really care about.The other problem was the chronology the director went with. The version I saw was fairly short anyway at 90 minutes, but even in that there were scenes repeated two, three times over. Taking the three timelines individually - even within them, the scenes did not run chronologically and I cannot see the reasoning behind that.I would hope a 2nd or 3rd watch of this would enlighten me on how the three Tom's linked each other. If it does, it's difficult to pick up first time round - and when the whole plot of the film is incomprehensible to you, you're in trouble.I'm sure there are those to which this film is very well suited, but they're better people than me - who was mislead by descriptions of the film which are way, way off the mark.3/10.",3,4,9,27 August 2007
It's a Wonderful Life," Should be compulsory to watch.
","Most of the IMDB Top 30 I disagree with. The majority I find either a)awful or more often b)Good, but certainly not great. After an hour or so, I started mentally making notes to classify this as the latter. It was good but sort of plodded along with no great direction. Suddenly, the last third of the film arrives, and everything that went on before fell into place brilliantly. I've never before come across a film where the ending added so many extra marks on, thus making the whole film amazing. Only this & the Great Escape I can truly say have evoked every emotion possible in me from high to low, and I dare I say don't even like James Stewart that much either, but he's brilliant & suited here unlike Vertigo.Everyone in the World should watch this film.Not quite a 10/10 but a very very high 9.",9,1,6,1 February 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," So who done it then? Ken Branagh? The bloke with the cat?
","Spoilers withinAm probably going out on a limb here & risking barrages of abuse but from the second my back side sat in front of the 'Auto Windscreens' Advert until when the words come up at the end I didn't have the slightest clue what was happening.Now I'm in my 20's, got a degree, do crosswords & pub quizzes so I'm not completely stupid but I'm starting to realise that I am a bit thick with fantasy films & when God put me on this planet, he never intended for me to appreciate them. As soon as I hear the lines 'But where is Thorac, 3rd son of ... Twattius' or someone, I'm dying to shout out 'I don't know. I don't care where he is' Then realising they're going to start looking for him I'm thinking, 'Look fellers, just leave him alone, we can all save ourselves half hour & be home by the 2nd half of the football.'Nearly three hours, Harry Potter lasted & the whole thing went way over my head. There was this kid about 7, further along in our row who kept asking 'what's happening now mummy'? To everyone else in the cinema he was a right pain up the arse, but to me he was a diamond. What few bits I did understand was thanks to him asking & 'mummy' explaining.I'm not for one minute saying it was crap. It may even have been quite good if I knew what happened. There was a while in the middle where I rubbed the old hands with excitement as it has a touch of the Agatha Christies about it & looked like it was building up to a Whodunnit. But that lasted about 30 seconds. In the end I'm led to believe the villain was a book. Oh, closely assisted by a dead bloke. Not Ken Branaghs character (who I never really saw the relevance of) or Robbie Coltrane (who again was excellent) but a book.Some more intellectual criticisms were that much of the opening seemed to be merely repeating the first film, and then at the station when the entrance was closed were they stranded from the alternative world? No. They just took the car & somehow ended up there. This was probably explained, but I missed it & it seemed to defeat the purpose of the entrance. The quiddich game & as interesting as it looks, seems of little relevance in enhancing the plot. We're supposed to cheer on Harry and / or his school team (whose name escapes me) against the baddies' but I don't bond enough with any of them to gain pleasure when they win or are awarded extra points. The 'Malfoy' character for instance is for me, is just about the best in the film (as with the 1st film).The problem I see is that Harry Potter does not seem to know whether it wants to market itself as a film for kids, teenagers or adults. Consequently it seems to want to do all 3. There were several 'bloody hells' and a plot I'm convinced no 8 year old could fully grasp. Therefore the film has be open to some criticisms that wouldn't otherwise apply to a traditional childrens' film. I'm a little dubious of anyone, that is so into Wizardy that they can churn out endless books, characters, stories and ideas about the subject. Rightly or wrongly, for me JK Rowling verges on 'Trekkie-ism'.The scenic shots & the cinematography in general was pretty impressive but I think Chris Columbus should stick to exploring & colonising natives from Haiti. Fair play he was superb at that, but I've just not got the imagination for Wizards, giant dragons, trap doors or people whose names end in 'ius' and consequently cannot appreciate this sort of film to anywhere near the level it is supposed be viewed at.A low 4/10",2,3,6,4 December 2002
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Good film yes. Great film no.
","I chose to see this partly on the strength of it being in the IMDB Top 10 & I have to say I was disappointed.SpoilersThe first hour was excellent, but it seemed everything that could've occurred or been said had, by this point and the last hour & quarter did drag unnecessarily. You done well if you stayed awake throughout the last hour.I believe the viewer is supposed to hate Nurse Radchett. I didn't. I found her ok, and certainly not malicious like some commenters have done. She is only doing her job after all, in an environment where some of the patients are highly dangerous.I've not read the book, but people who have tell me it is one of the worst adaptations ever. I'll have to abstain from that.On the plus side, the acting is just brilliant. Nicholson, DeVito, Lloyd, infact the whole cast are worthy of a best actor award. You genuinely do believe every one of them are mental patients, and play each role perfectly. I struggle to think of a film with a better display of acting in it.Some of the scenes too, are moving, and you do feel for them but I certainly don't find the film depressing. Sadly though, I am staggered people have claimed this to be funny. Some scenes may raise a smile at most, but laugh? No.The ending was also disappointing, infact I'm not really sure what exactly it signified. I can't help thinking the book would've explained it easier.But the biggest problem I had with this film was that I never knew the whole way through whether Mac wanted to be in the hospital or not? Half the time he seemed to love it in there, but then the other half he was either escaping or wishing he was outside. One or two of the other characters were fairly similar too. Why the hell did he keep coming back in again? Or maybe, that is the whole point of the film. He sees the benefits both inside & out & can't make up his mind.I've certainly seen enough Americans leaping away from exploding cars, in films, to last me a lifetime, so I'm not suggesting this film needed that, but at the end of the day, it was set 99% in a mental hospital, and there's only so much you can do in that environment. It just lacked that extra bit of excitement, action, tension & suspense to make it a classic.
Anyway. There's plenty worse films in the IMDB top 20 than this, not mentioning any Citizen Kanes or Fight Clubs, sorry, I mean any names, so I would certainly recommend it, but don't expect it to be upto Star Wars or Shawshank Redemption standard.6.5 /10",6,5,9,2 December 2001
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," What?
","What? How? Wh.. What was this?It was the strangest.. I hesitate to use the word 'film' ever. I'm staggered to read it was intended as a comedy. Even as a film it failed miserably.I'll admit I've never heard of any of the principal actors, I've never heard of Saturday night Live, nor any of the numerous -presumably- American celebrities, events, locations & terms that are referred to throughout. Most - if not all - have yet to make it across the pond here.But the basic premise I was familiar with nonetheless. Local news set up, all guys, an anchorman, sports reader, reporter & weatherman. Unfortunately that was where my recognition ended. None of the 4 characters bared even a semblance of a familiarity to anything I had ever encountered on local news, so I've not idea what they were spoofing or taking off.They are 4 of the least likable characters in film history. Three of them do not have a single amusing line in the film, the weather guy has a few but by then you are so bored you've forgotten how to smile.The was a tiny bit of promise in the film when the girl arrived & had no interest in any of the 4 fellers. That tiny glimmer of hope of an interesting film went when she fell for Ron - A man who had absolutely nothing going for him to offer a woman, and quite how the pair were intended as a convincing match is beyond me.The two main scenes went way over my head. Neither the big fight scene nor the finale at the zoo, offered anything remotely funny or even slightly interesting.I'd like to put this down to yet another example of the big differences in humour either side of the Atlantic (responsible for the likes of Jim Carrey, Ben Stiller & Adam Sandler all being considered comedians, but even allowing for that I'm surprised anyone found anything funny in this.I too watched this on a plane to L.A & unfortunately, someone else just below has used my gag about wishing I walked out.A very low 2/10 (that's being generous for the weatherman having a couple of scenes that could just about -at a stretch- fall into the humour bracket.",2,3,8,21 November 2004
Wonder Woman," OK
","One of the more enjoyable films of the genre, if only for the opening scenes and the WW1 angle, which was enjoyable if you ignore the fast pace and the endless plot holes and inaccuracies.It is all largely enjoyable until the last 45 minutes or so, around the airfield which is absolutely tedious, ruins much of the story before it and is better watched in fast forward.If they skipped the love interest, the MP twist and the fight scenes of the last hour, it would have improved it considerably.",6,0,2,26 August 2018
Blow," Dull
","Blow is by no means the worst film in the world. I watched the 2 hour version and it kept my attention throughout. Unfortunately it never done anything more than that. It's pretty run of the mill stuff, occasionally it verged on interesting, but all too often was crying out for an exciting scene, or just for something to happen to stimulate the viewer, but it rarely came.4/10",4,1,2,22 March 2003
Shrek," Dull
","Not much to say on this one except how staggering it is that a) it is in the top 120 and b) children apparently like it.It's almost as bad as the equally awful Monsters Inc. It plods along with no laughs & a story as weak as urine that never really goes anywhere. I was bored enough that I never even observed the 'Disney in gags' that I've just found out the film had a plenty.It wasn't awful, but nor should it be mentioned in the same breath as the brilliant Chicken Run or Toy Story 1 & 2 which show how animation films can suit all ages and have plenty of laughs too.4/10",4,3,6,21 May 2003
Vanilla Sky," I knew people would like this.
","Vanilla Sky was crap. Occasionally it did threaten to be remotely interesting, but on each occasion it was soon brought to a shuddering halt.I detest braindead Hollywood action films, exploding cars, unnecessary sex or violence. Likewise, I enjoy a good thinking film open to interpretation. So reading these reviews I should of enjoyed this film. Wrong.
It was awful. I had no problem following it or understanding the plot 'getting it' as many have said. It was just painfully dull & went against everything that good cinema is about. Dreams are difficult to effectively insert into films at the best of times but it was done terribly here.
Interpretations are all well & good, but I'd imagine no 2 people who even worked on this film would share a view exactly what went on. It asked some interesting questions & created some Matrix style ideas. Unfortunately, none of them were fully executed & you end up with more questions than answers.Maybe it was just the whole subject. This wasn't the film I set out to see nor had any idea it was a remake, but I get the feeling I won't enjoy the original, nor, heaven forbid, any future similar films.I gave it an hour & a half of solid concentration but then lost the will to live. I counted all 88 folds in the curtain, then double checked it, counted ceiling tiles and shattered my recored of 'amount of times I looked at a watch during 1 film'. Sadly I never had the sense to sleep or leave the cinema like most others did.",2,0,0,28 January 2002
Any Given Sunday," Did Manchester win?
","I'm an absolute sport addict but even I would be the first to admit that very rarely is sport the basis for a good film. This was no exception.
I don't particularly like American Football (I find the idea of using pads & crash helmets in a contact sport a bit like swimmers using a boat) but each to their own, I like sports like cricket which others rightly find tedious. What does annoy me is how America continually export American Football and expect the rest of the world to not only understand it but enjoy it. Fair enough present the film to a U.S market but not a worldwide one. England does not export films about cricket, nor do Scotland with log throwing, Australia with Aussie rules or Pakistan with Kabadi etc. Yet as sure as night follows day you can rely on an American Football film being released in every country each year.This was not an awful film but nor was it very good. Lots of shouting, lots of swearing, lots of technical jargon, sex and nudity, although at least with the latter of those 5, it was great to see another barrier broken with a woman around some naked fellers which happens all over the world but is still a taboo area on the tele. But despite that Cameron Diaz (as good a actress as she is did not suit her role at all). In real life women in senior sporting positions 99% of the time appear convincing and suited to what they do. Unfortunately in films and on the tele they hardly ever do. I'm not sure why but it seems the script writers try too hard and give them too much technical jargon, when in normal life the female directors and coaches like male ones aren't rattling on 24/7 about off sides, play offs, free kicks and the like.To an outsider to American Football there just didn't seem to be any coherence to this film. It appeared we joint the film somewhere around the beginning / middle of a season and it ended about half a dozen games later still mid season? There didn't seem to be a natural beginning or end to the film. And the Sharks seemed to lose a lot of matches yet find themselves still involved in a seemingly crucial game at the end,  which I couldn't fathom out at all. Though I could be completely wrong but then that was the problem. The first 20 minutes went way over my head and throughout the film, I could only guess what side was scoring and winning purely by the reaction of Pacino or the opposing coach. Also, as far as I could work out, in the final scenes a perfectly good touchdown was disallowed by the ref because there was a yellow duster or tea towel on the field of play, which obviously signified something I didn't comprehend. There were also occasions when I wasn't sure to laugh or not (like the guys' eye falling out or James Foxx being sick) or maybe these were serious.The exception to all this is Remember the Titans which was an absolutely awesome film. I'm not sure why that worked so well and this one didn't, but Remember the Titans seemed to know how to present American Football to the overseas viewer far better than Any Given Sunday. For a start there was less on field action in The Titans and what scenes were on the Grid Iron were easier to understand to those unfamiliar which a seemingly complex set of laws. But as I said, not an awful film, there was no problem with the acting per se and I hacked it through to the end. I just wasn't sure which team won.3/10",3,0,1,12 August 2003
Blade Runner," Pretty run-of-the-mill Harrison Ford action film.
","Whilst I never really enjoyed or got into this film, it wasn't through it having anything majorly wrong with it. More a collection of little things that didn't really interest me. Some of which are reasons others like the film for.Films set in the future (which is a difficult concept to tackle) often present it as a 'World Gone Wrong'. I'm not a fan of dark, depressing miserable settings, in any film really. We also seemed to go for lengths of time without scenes of any great tension, mystery or even dialogue in them. Overall just a bit too Sci-Fi for my liking.When Ford did narrate segments, he (& the film) asked some very interesting questions. I just didn't think the film had the quality to back them up in any way.4/10",4,3,14,8 February 2002
The Greatest Showman," Solid
","A pretty good film, suitable for anyone, any age. The fact that I like it and this is not a genre of film that I usually would, was a pleasant surprise.The signing, acting, characters, plot are all fine, no gripes with them. The morality is never completely clear as to what way you should be feeling, or who you should be siding with, which is a good thing, as there isn't necessarily a right or wrong and it lets the viewer decide.This could have been better though, one or two of songs towards the end, became a little bit of a chore to get through and dragged out a plot which was developing well at the time. They seemed to be included as they had gone ten minutes without one, rather than it adding to the film.The character time could have been distributed better. The Zac Efron relationship was not given anywhere near enough time.All in all though, well worth a watch. You won't find much better at the cinema.",7,1,3,15 February 2018
Signs," I paid a tenner for a 2 hour kip.
","Possible spoilers within (although that implies that there is something worth spoiling, which there isn't).There are a few films in the top 250 which I detest, but at least with those films even though I hate them I can at least appreciate their reasons behind being popular.But I am absolutely baffled beyond belief that this films has a ranking to put it anywhere near the top poll. For the life of me I cannot think of one redeeming feature of the plot that would appeal to any like minded viewer. My problems with this film went far beyond that of the unconvincing aliens or equally unconvincing sci-fi aspects of the film.Whether the film sold itself as a horror, chilling, eerie or any similar description I'm not sure, but other commenters have certainly praised it as scary, chilling, pulsating etc etc. Do me a favour! 'Signs' was about as scary or chilling as an episode of Phillip Schofields' National Lottery Jetset. If it was frightening, would it have a certificate of '12'?That was the most annoying part of the film. Given the quality of the cinematography and the expertly chosen scenery, in the opening scenes of the cornfields there was me thinking I was looking at the perfect set of surroundings for the ideal chiller or thriller. It still probably could've been, but was just let down by any sort of remotely interesting set of events.Other viewers & critics seem to be able to still praise a film highly if the acting, shots, directing etc are excellent even if the plot is pretty non existent, but I can't. Granted much of the film other than the story as I said was good, the acting was equally impressive, but there was not one thing to engross the viewer at all.You more or less knew where the story (and I used the term story in the loosest possible sense) would end up from the outset. Although despite that, it still struck me as a film where much of it seemed made up as it went along and still needed to be redrafted. More like a collection of scenes than a 2 hour film.The characters, despite being played well, were all devoid of any interest whatsoever. Consequently you never felt any liking for them & never really gave a toss what would happen to them. Mel's flashbacks served more as an irritation, with the boy I was never assured of his role as to whether he was your typical brainy geek or or someone a bit dim, and yet again the young girl seemed to play a role and speak in the manner of someone far older than herself. The rest of their behaviour & the other characters were academic & largely irrelevant. So much of the characters seemed cliched and flogged to death in previous films.Some of the time I felt like I was watching a remake of ideas and a plot that I'd seen before, but then each time it seemed like a new idea may introduce itself it came over as ridiculous. Aliens that could leap over a roof and with technology to travel the world, but not able to get out of a kitchen or through a door with a plank of wood nailed to it. And the water? what was that all about, they come to earth with nothing to defend themselves from the earths inhabitants or from the rain or water that covers 4/5 of the planet.A few commenters have claimed the film to be funny. Unless it is through laughing at ideas like those above and not with them, then I must have been watching a different film. The cinema was reasonable full but there was not a single hint of laughter from anyone from start to finish.I feel a bit sorry for the director though. His two main works prior to this have both revolved around a 'twist' to shock the viewer, so people come to expect it in this. Even those who enjoyed Signs, surely cannot claim there was any sort of twist in this. To me, it all passed without a moment of interest or shock and at no point had anything to keep the viewer guessing, asking questions to themselves or surprised, and consequently nothing really happened.2/10 (1 for the location & 1 because it's better then any of the Robin Askwith films that occupy all my 1/10's)",2,2,3,21 September 2002
The Sixth Sense," Did my video chop the last 10 minutes off?
","Spoilers ThroughoutI was in shock at the end of this film. But, because of how ridiculously it ended and more so because most of the questions hadn't been answered, and indeed still haven't. Up until 10 minutes from the end it was pretty good. 10 minutes later it had degenerated into a complete farce.Where do we start?Are you telling me someone can go 9 months or so without realising they're dead and not a single person speaking to, or even acknowledging him in that time? What has he been doing for food in that time? I guessed this outcome right at the start but then dismissed immediately after as it wouldn't have worked.Nobody I speak to seems to know for certain whether the child knew Bruce Willis was a ghost. If he did, then why was he not scared of him? What made Bruce so special? and did he not see the patch of blood on his mack? and how come only he can change his clothes and not appear in the state he died in?
And how come Bruce is able to lob a lump of rock at a shop window or play a tape recording yet all the other ghosts need to attract this kid to do anything. Why could the girl at the funeral not have just put her video tape somewhere where the dad would've seen it?Ghosts also go nowhere near churches and I thought maybe there might have been a link as to why either Bruce or the kid were particularly special or gifted, despite constant refererences to his past. If you look closely enough, his Wife does acknowledge him at their anniversary, so does the kids mum when he walks in their house.It does not suprise me The 'Great Unwashed' of Britain and America consider this an amazing and clever ending. Anyone who has watched an Agatha Christie film would be use to it. Anyone who has watched 'Jonathan Creek' would get endings twice as brilliant and complex as this every week, where everything is resolved.",2,3,6,12 November 2000
Rear Window," As per usual
","usual high standard of Hitchcock maintained here in another great thriller. Although, having seen all his big films, I'd have this a mark less than Psycho, Dial M & North by Northwest. It was still great, with all the usual compliments to be paid here too. Great camera work, scenery, directing, and tension & phenomenal acting from all parties. The only slight criticism of the films is that the lead man, despite usually being awesome does tend to play a role of a man with a lifestyle (& a woman) several years younger than himself, but that never affects the plot of the film.Rear Window was just let down slightly by occasional lulls of anything happening, 5 minutes here & there, particularly at the beginning where the story stood still. Nor was it the sort of film where you'd ask yourself why? or how? during it. The way it would pan out was pretty clear from early on. I just thought there may have been a little more significance with one or two of the other neighbours, & 2 or 3 seconds of poor editing right at the finale was the only other aspect that slightly dated the film.But overall, still a good watch & as good as anything today.A high 7/10",7,0,1,11 March 2002
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," An absolute pleasure
","1 of only 11 films I've given 10/10 to out of 400, it's almost perfection. It's a sad state in England when there's more exposure to the Worlds most significant historical figures in one 90 minute American film than you get in 20 years of education here. Even allowing for the inaccuracies & toning down of Billy & Genghis it still teaches you more, infact even acknowledging these figures existed & when they lived is more than most TV does and most viewers sadly know.I wouldn't actually call this a funny film, ie laughing out loud. That seems to be the one reason people have for disliking it. It's highly enjoyable & a highly amusing film. People sadly see it described as that and stupidly expect it to be a Leslie Nielson type film.Only Back to the Future has made time travel as enjoyable. It just baffles me what anyone can dislike about the story here, your mind can wander off for hours during and after, and every character is loveable and brilliantly written into the story.
A rating way below what it deserves and pure entertainment & education for all ages.10/10",10,0,0,17 March 2002
Heat," Bloody hard work
","I'm sorry to go against the norm here, but I didn't enjoy this one bit. Even more surprising given there's about half a dozen actors in it I really like. But It actually took me 3 attempts to hack it through to the end & sent me to sleep once at 11am after a full nights kip before.I'm going off police films or shows anyway as too many tend to resemble extended episodes of TJ Hooker or Dempsey & Makepiece & this weren't a great deal different. It started off with some promise but degenerated into an overlong soap opera. At no point did I ever give a monkeys about Pacino's marital problems nor whether DeNiro or Kilmer sorted it out with their women. That don't mean I like the bang-bang you're dead type police films, I like some character insight but the amount of dialogue in this was ridiculous. The script must have looked like War & Peace. The scene with Pacino & DeNiro in the restaurant summed that up. I knew as I watched it everyone would rave over it, but I still can't watch that scene, even on it's own, without my concentration waining half way through. It seemed as if the director wanted to get as many 'cool' quotes in as he could & sacrificed the tension level because of it. Thus, when the plot did get complex from time to time, with the extra characters, it really required 110% concentration at all times.John Voight mumbled too much, Pacino shouted too much, almost Ric Flair-esque at some points, each character much have had tracking devices on each other the amount of times they bumped into each other, some of the least adept Police were on duty, there seemed far too many anonymous or convenient tip-offs and lots more was left unresolved after the end.Over half an hour & some of the subplots could have been chopped from this film. I know it was an insight into the contrasting lives, of the 'policeman & the criminal' but it was too much insight. I rate DeNiro & Pacino as much as anyone, but lets be honest you could have an hour of the pair of them on the bog, having a dump & reading the paper out loud & there'd be a hard-core group of fans who'd still worship it.3or4/10",3,13,30,4 February 2002

Cube," For the large part, very good.
","I've never been so on the edge of my seat for a film ever. For 95% I was questioning & guessing everything & was all set to give this 10/10. Suddenly the end came & that was it. We were all left with just 2 words. 'What the'? What?I don't mind films where you interpret your own ending at all, but this was silly. If you take it to the extreme, it won't be long until a film where people interpret the whole thing.I hated Blair Witch Project, due partly to the unresolved ending, but at least with that, if anyone tells you about the film, most peoples interpretations, though different, will tend to resolve most of the issues. This didn't.I can see all the messages behind this. The reflections of society, the anger & hostility, the many prison allusions etc etc. That was all very good. But there must have been a better way of tackling it whilst at least tying up some of questions but keeping the same themes.
I didn't have a problem with never finding out how they arrived in the cube. That point gradually became less & less relevant but they could have resolved the why? & the who? questions.I would rather watch a crap film with a botched rushed ending than a magnificent film (which is what this was) with that same ending. The Quentin character also lost this film a mark. He'd become a pain up the arse by the end.Still, the whole concept is amazing, I was gripped throughout and am now excited for the Cube 2 film & also seeking out films on a similar concept to this. But that's really in the hope, that they will be tackled AND RESOLVED better than this one.6/10",6,0,1,11 February 2002
The Great Escape," The only 'perfect movie' ever made.
","Brilliant. The perfect 10 out of 10. Every member of the cast is a legend and play their part wonderfully. The fact it is almost 3 hours is forgotten as you are on the edge of your seat the whole time. It has it all. Action, adventure, humour and sadness. To anyone who has never seen this film : If I could have one wish, I would love to have never seen this film so I can experience the brilliance of watching it for the first time again. You don't know how lucky you are. The best film ever by a mile.",10,3,7,20 August 2000
The Cabin in the Woods," ABOVE AVERAGE
","Usual crock of reviews with most votes either 1, 9 or 10/10 when to anyone sensible it is none of those and to call it either a faultless classic or worst film of all time is daft.Nor is it a film that you will 'either love or hate' - I was neither way, it is ok, but definitely worth watching. I have seen a few of these types of films recently, including two Escape Rooms and it is better than anyone of those.What was good and slightly unusual for these films is that generally the characters were not too annoying and you could root for them rather than the opposite.As a spoiler those that made it to the end are the ones which you expected from the start, but there are a few other twists along the way, moments that you are not expecting and it never drags.I am not sure where any laughing and funny scenes, with one possible exception in the lift, but not being funny did not hinder it at all.The only faults I could find were that the scenes with the Japanese children needed explaining as to who was who and the force field around the area was given away early. It is quite Americanised in parts of the language but easy enough to follow.All in all, worth a watch if you are fans of the genre and want better films than most of the slasher ones around.A low 6/10.",6,1,1,7 June 2020
True Romance," fair enough rating.
","This is one of the few films where the IMDB average is about right, at 7.5/10. It maybe fractionally overated but not by much. Had the potential though to be better & much of it's popularity is probably due to the great cast and also the director (who I personally don't rate, but everybody else seems to) rather than the plot.SpoilersTrue Romance lost marks because the film never actually covered that much ground & took a little long to get to the shootout which was basically the core of the film. The shoot out itself was also a slight farce as they tend to be when more than 2 are parties involved. Also, though the swearing was sometimes justified, half of the F-words that came out of Slater's mouth were completely unnecessary.For those 3 criticisms I'd have it at 7/10, still fairly good & excellent acting, from, just about everybody really.Two side issues. Was it me or did the Christopher Walkern, Sicillian character just disappear after the scene with Dennis Hopper & if so, why?It also never ceases to amaze me how people any scene, of any of these type of gangster related films (Snatch, Pulp Fiction, Lock Stock, Goodfellas etc) funny in any way. I'm not saying they're not good. They are, well the last 2 anyway, are brilliant, but not because they make me laugh. It doesn't matter what way people getting shot is jazzed up, I fail to see where the laughs are. Thankfully though this doesn't lessen my enjoyment at all, as I never expect to be in hysterics.",7,1,2,24 January 2002
Contact," Below average
","Not an awful film at all, but devoted a lot of time to a plot which didn't really cover that much. There seemed too much emphasis on the religious aspect and the usual cliched sceptics of anything slightly subnormal. Also lots of rushing around shouting and scientific terminology being quoted, most of which could be ignored. The acting wasn't anything out of the ordinary either. Despite that though, it does connect with the viewer on occasions, has one or two emotional scenes & some well shot ones and is worth watching if nothing else is on.4/10",4,3,6,28 February 2002
The Wedding Singer," This is everything bad about films.
","This is without doubt one of the worst films ever made.Possible spoilers throughout.First of all though, I loved the 80's & the music & still listen to it today.However, oh where do I start? Probably with locking up whoever decided 2 people falling in love should be the basis for a film. Casablanca & Gone With the Wind were doing it 60 years ago. Every way it can happen has now been done to death.Also flogged to death is the idea of finding amusement in a previous era or decade. The 80's mocked the 60's, 90's did the 70's. No doubt in 20 years time when we say 'Remember November 2001'? Will everyone reply 'ha ha ha November 2001 - stop it, you're too funny.'? I hope not. I grew up in the 1980's. Trust me people weren't getting on buses or walking around shops in hysterics at everyone.Just like American Pie, to describe this as a 'comedy' must contravene every trade description law in the book. Please tell me one scene in this that was amusing? With the exception of Sandler mocking table 9 near the start, nothing remotely raise a laugh. I had the misfortune to watch this film on a coach & witnessed other passengers in hysterics at a) a man doing nothing but impersonating Boy George & 2) Sandler singing 'Love Stinks.'Questions. On Stars in their Eyes (a UK talent show where members of the public compete by replicating a famous singer) Do the audience sit their laughing as someone takes off Boy George, Adam Ant or any other 80's singer. No.If I got up in a pub & started singing 'Love Stinks' would that be funny? No. It would be annoying & I'd be thrown out (probably with a bar stool wrapped around me.The reason in both cases are they are not funny because it's not a second rate American comic doing it.I genuinely sat there after 20 minutes & thought 'something else must happen. Please don't make the plot as banal as these 2 getting it on. I like Drew Barrymore too. I've never seen Sandler in anything else, but would be more than willing to watch another one. Hopefully it won't be as bad as this.Another idea older than the hills. Someone drunk ruining a best man speech. Please.I would happily buy the CD of this if I saw it (or if it exists) as I love the music. So what I don't want is to constantly hear the first 20 seconds of one good song after another only for it to cut out just at the start of the chorus. Someone should issue a restraining order that songs stay 500 yards away from films at all times, if this is what happens.I've come to the conclusion that apart from 1)Naked Gun/Airplane type films 2)The Simpsons & 3)Will Smith, Americans are incapable of exporting anything funny outside of their own country.Leave comedies with a romantic plot to the writers of Four Weddings & a Funeral & Notting Hill as they show you how it should be done and are in a different league to this crap. This films only gets a 1/10 as their isn't a '0' on the scale.By all means rent this film out. But when you do, watch the first 5 minutes, go away, and come back for the last 5 minutes. You'll follow everything that has gone on.",1,6,18,5 November 2001
Goodfellas," The standard bearer for all gangster films
","If I had my way, this is the film that all gangster & violence films should be measured up against. It sets all the standards which some films have since lived up to but most have failed miserably.Dare I say it, it's better than Godfather 1 & probably even part 2, and that takes some doing.The main reason, is the plot is kept simple, there's just the right amount of characters. Even Godfather 1 -if you can find a fault with it- probably has just one or two extra Italians to confuse you slightly.This is gangster films & even films generally, at it's best.Sure there's some gruesome & heartless scenes, and I felt for the innocent postman, but they fit in perfectly with the context of the film and create exactly the mood.Of course, the main reason is that it's based on true accounts which you can easily believe. If only others in the film industry would try to do likewise.9.5/10 if such a vote existed, it doesn't so 10/10. Alongside only Star Wars, Great Escape, Shawshank Redemption & the Magnificent 7 out of 300 films. That's pretty good company.",9,0,0,5 December 2001
The Simpsons Movie," Disappointing
","Given the standards set by one of the funniest shows ever - certainly the most humorous by a mile from America, this was really disappointing.Others go into greater depth as to why, too deep really. The problems were quite simple: 1) The who plot was tediously dull - never cared for the outcome. It wasn't a plot for a film. Imagine real characters played by real people. Would it still be interesting or a film script? Never in a million years. Who Killed Mr Burns would make an ideal script for a real film. Frank Grimes would. This never did. They should've worked on a good script and fitted the characters & gags around that.2) There were no subplots.3) No jokes - barely any to make you laugh - Fat Tony dumping the body & Chief Wiggum's response was one of the greatest gags ever. Worth a mark on it's own. Where was the rest of those? One or two others (from Martin) but nothing that hurt you, like in the TV show.4) Underuse of the good characters. Homer has gone from the funniest character in the show to slightly irritating and the rest of the Simpsons have never been the well crafted or interesting characters. Where was Burns, Capt McAllister, Wiggum, Ralph, Quimby, Brockman, Martin? Were Patty & Selma even in it? Overuse of new characters too.5) Recycled gags & plots. Whole town V Simpsons has been done to death, so to Marge leaving Homer, Simpson's moving away, Homer's invincibility crashing into things (catchphrases can remain funny but entire scenes rarely do).6) Far too much music throughout the film which added nothing.7) Nothing to do with the pig was funny, nor Homer getting Bart to skateboard naked seemed to be cobbled together in 2 minutes.I'll still give it 5/10. It was The Simpsons after all and though such a let down from the standard it has set, there was probably some enjoyment in there.",5,4,5,10 February 2008
Dodgeball," A comedy??
","I only nipped on here quickly to pen a few lines on Dodgeball, but thought I would read a few other reviews quickly. I'm amazed to learn it was a comedy.I watched it on a plane which I now feel let down by, as at least having been in a cinema, I could've at least have been made aware of the scenes I was supposed to laugh at.If it was meant to be slap stick it was a poor mans Airplane or Naked Gun. How many more of these 'Groups of Misfits decide to enter a sports competition and ... wait for it ... they win - and beat a load of pros along the way' films will we get? We've had Major League, Up N Under, a million football ones. They're all exactly the same but with a different shaped ball.The dodge ball game itself seemed quite enjoyable, but would've been better if they devoted a few minutes more to the game and less time or pathetic, supposedly amusing incidents. In the first game against the Girl Guides, fair enough - have some of the players be hit in the face & knocked out by a ball. But we had about a dozen matches of this in all. It was exactly the same situations recycled with different characters over & over again.The Ben Stiller character was so over the top it was ridiculous. Likewise, so were all the opposition teams: Lumberjacks, the Japanese. They didn't add anything that having 6 ordinary looking blokes in shorts & a T Shirt would have had, the Average Joe team (with the exception of the thin geeky bod who was an outstanding character) offered nothing remotely amusing and quite what the point of the co-commentator alongside Gary Cole was, I will never know. Vince Vaughn is a good actor & always strikes me as good decent bloke, but I'm still unsure as to what his best acting role is. It wasn't this. He was actually one of the best things about Dodgeball, but (and I can't put my finger on exactly what) something didn't seem right with his role here.Humour always loses credibility for me, when reality has to be suspended so much that things that would normally kill someone ie Spanners being thrown into someones head barely even graze someone. It's no different to having someone fall 500 feet off a mountain, then when they land just get up & brush themselves down and walk away unscathed.That's fine in cartoons (when the bump on the forehead is just pressed back into place) but I can't see it as comedy in supposed films for grown-ups, if that it what this was. Even in cartoons, and something as brilliant - and as funny - as the Simpsons, Homer bouncing down a cliff and being fine, is one of the few criticisms you can level at it.Thankfully the plane began it's descent 10 minutes from the end of this film so I missed that but it wouldn't take Einstein to work out that Average Joe's Gym must have either won the match or lost it but then clawed victory from the jaws of defeat thanks to another technicality.I like Ben Stiller in Meet The Parents and one or two other films but that is purely on an acting or characters basis. Unfortunately this is now, I think 6 films and he is still yet to make me laugh or even raise a snigger.3/10",Null,0,2,11 November 2004
High Fidelity," Please tell me 1 scene that was funny in this crap
","A film about a blokes previous 5 girlfriends is dull even thinking about it. You might get away with it if it was funny, along the 4 Weddings & a Funeral line. Unfortunately there wasn't one laugh in this from any of us. You might also have got away with the idea if it was very moving or maybe had a surprise ending, neither of which happened here.I never remotely cared or liked any character in this, the time scale & flashbacks didn't appear to always be coherent, (the scenes could've been put together in any order) I found the Jack Black character one of the most annoying in any film ever (maybe he was meant to be, but he irritated me almost as much as the bird in Blair Witch Project). As a 20something male, none of Rob's behaviour struck any cords with me. The viewers that enjoyed this, females especially, would've been happy regardless of which woman he ended up with.It's not John Cusack that I don't like. It's just his films. 2/10 (America's Sweethearts got 1/10 & this is better than that)",2,2,5,6 February 2002
