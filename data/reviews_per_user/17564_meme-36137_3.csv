Kill Bill: Vol. 2," All about the Bride and her journey
","The second part gives us a more in depth look into the actions that the Bride had taken in the first part, how she decided to make a change and the consequences of it all. It has some of the best dialogue written especially in the last parts of the movie when Bill and Kiddo finally meet. Their interaction is what makes the movie special it gives us an insight into what makes them who they are. Bill is cold and has a heart at the same time, Kiddo is deadly yet vulnerable and has a difficult time speaking her emotional state. This is most evident when Bill drops by the Chapel and her hesitation and fear is displayed by the frantic looks and tone changes Uma thurman uses, the Bride is most human then. Both movies are a one destination journey, the most touching part is her journey as a warrior under the tutelage of Pai Mei. This is where we catch a glimpse of the warrior that Kiddo really is, and what makes her different from all the others, she has a deep honor and respect for tradition. This casts her in a superior mold to Bill as a warrior, who is cunning and fierce but lacks the dedication Kiddo has for she has an honor code they all lack.",9,0,1,20 May 2018
Unknown," Beautifully shot fun to watch
","This is one of my go to action movies, let me start off by saying the lighting in the movie and its editing is so clear and beautiful, kudos to the crew. I love Liam Neeson in action movies especially after Taken, he is always believable in his role. The supporting cast is equally good in their parts especially Diane Kruger and January Jones. It is a fun watch shot beautifully, it deserves a viewing.",8,1,1,1 September 2017
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," More than revenge, a life lived
","One of the best action movies, with a great depiction of cultures and fighting styles, it can be considered a homage and it is. What adds depth to the movie is Uma Thurman's performance as she becomes a character whose life has come full circle so to speak. The musical score with the dialogues everything has been done superbly, with each part of the movie saying more than what the screen shows us, which is the best part of the movie, you get to fill in the gaps of who the characters were before and who they became just by the bits of info about their life given to us. The Bride is a character filled with depth we do not know her back story which is what gives her an even unique role, the same can be said about the majority of characters, they are who they are just like people in life.",9,0,1,20 May 2018
