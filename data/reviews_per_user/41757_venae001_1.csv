The King's Speech," What A Film!
",Really enjoyed this! It was a very humorous film. I would highly recommend it! It is a very mature film and contains lots of adult humour but there are some really great moments. Very inspirational and I think they did an excellent job! Colin Firth is an excellent actor and I love a lot of his material. He played the part excellently and I think he deserves a lot of credit. This is actually now one of my favourite films. I love how they have captured a modern audience with such an old story. I rated it a 9 as it was a tad boring in places. But 9 is still very good. It is one of the best films i've seen in a while and would recommend it definitely!,9,0,2,22 February 2011
