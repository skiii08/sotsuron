Howl's Moving Castle," One way trip!
","Twice in many years I saw the movie and felt the same: a surreal feeling of living amoung characters and their adventures! The unexpected love between characters it's an unique thing which brings me back to my sweet youth. One thing though, I am unbelievably sad that young people don't give more interest to these movies. Worth my time and it worth to waste a couple of years not watching it, because of new feelings that I've got. I can't wait to watch it again a few years from now.",10,0,0,30 April 2020
