The Expendables 2," Symbols of awesomness become expendable again
","6 stars would rate it a good movie. 4 stars rates it below average which it is. The movie isn't better or worse than the first. Action is without suspense and there is no sense of space or logic in the gunfights. There is some choreography, mostly Statham and Stallone, but gunfights are pure randomness and good guys win. Camera and editing was mediocre, soundtrack was generic.There was only enough character humor to miss more of it. Almost all actors are underused and references to their previous famous roles are rare without any depth ('I'll be back'. That's it for Arnie. Really? Did he come back only to say that?).Anyway, you will like EX2 exactly as much as you did the Expendables. It could have been made into proper action, or proper trash or an absurd comedy like Top Secret. Or characters could have been fleshed out, for a change. What a waste of awesomness.PS Van Damme is pretty good as scumbag. Lundgren is actually funny when drunk, sadly it's about 17 seconds only.",4,17,36,17 August 2012
