Mission: Impossible III," JJ Abrams big screen debut is a mission thats surely irresistible
","Let me start off by saying that its a real shame that a ton of people are going to do to this movie exactly what a ton did to last years 'War of the Worlds' by simply A.) not seeing it because it has Tom Cruise or B.) not liking it simply because it has Tom Cruise.So hes different than you. Get over it. No one who actually knows him thinks hes psycho. Just because People magazine tells you he is doesn't mean so.Now that thats out of the way...This movie is the perfect way to start of the summer movie season. JJ Abrams has proved himself time and time again on the television screen and he doesn't miss hitting the mark on his big screen debut. He made an excellent choice by diving deeper into Ethan Hunt's character, and an even better choice by having Hoffman play the main villain. Its absolutely amazing to watch Phillip Seymour Hoffman play this otherwise one dimensional role. Most actors would take his character and just make it mediocre but Hoffman adds such sadistic depth and nonchalant wickedness to it. He is by far one of the best actors in the world.Cruise hits his usual mark. Underrated definitely but rarely excels to greatness. All the other cast members work incredible well to create the best set of side characters seen in the Mission Impossible series.MI III is far better that 2, and I enjoyed it better that the first one. If people want to have a terrific time this weekend they should go see it and forget that they dislike Cruise. Sure he may be getting bad publicity right now but hey, there are a whole hell of a lot of worse actors and actresses out there that deserve to be boycotted.",10,0,1,5 May 2006
Inside Man," A crime film that will have you cheering for the bank robbers
","Let me start off by saying I am not a Spike Lee fan. That said, this is not your average Spike Lee movie.The premise off the movie is a group of bank robbers led by Clive Owen under the alias of different versions of the name 'steve' pull off a bank heist taking hostages. Denzel Washington comes to save the day as the chief negotiator who is under review for some embezzlement issues. The usually smart criminal throws the dumb cops on several wild goose chases scenario plays out in full, but is beefed up with an extra storyline including Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer.Although the movie is smart it just fails on every single level. Not once was I able to take the police officers seriously because they were all making painstakingly stupid decisions and Denzel's incurious cop persona.The composer from the music must suffer from a form of ADD. The music leaps genres in a matter of cuts and takes you completely out of the movie experience.The last complaint is the ending. The movie just drags way too long in the end and when you finally reach the conclusion it isn't baffling at all. You knew it would happen. You knew it a mile away because that is the only smart way to end this dragged out mess of things.The plus side of the movie is that Clive Owen and the bank robbers are highly enjoyable to watch. Its fun to see how they work and how they treat all the hostages. Maybe thats sick of me, but when Denzel keeps cracking out stupid jokes and all his cohorts force acting their laughs watching Clive Owen bully people around is far cooler.Congrats Spike Lee and Denzel Washington. You both continue to be overrated artists.",6,9,54,13 March 2006
