Howl's Moving Castle," A really really good Anime Movie
","As many of you may have heard, Ghilbi studios released Howl's moving Castle around 24th Decemeber in Japan, it had received many positive comments.The film has no exact real plot, nor any good versus evil themes, which makes the anime movie unique. The music used is really good. You'll find the film touching all ages, perhaps some children may not understand the story fully, but ages 12 and above, its a recommended Film. I heard that it will release in USA around June 2004, in Japan it has already been released, France I believed has already been released.Howl's moving Castle is an emotional story, in which it revolves around Wizard howl and witch in the wasteland, as well as Sophie. The setting is placed mostly on the moving castle which is magically powered by calucifer (a cute evil spirit fire), and basically Howl had captured this spirit from a shooting star as u'll see in the movie. I wont say much, but its a must-see anime film.",10,7,12,26 January 2005
