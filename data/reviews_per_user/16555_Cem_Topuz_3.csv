War Dogs," double henry
","if War Dogs could be funny as it's trailer promises, it's rating could be seven...but not even close to two if you actually watch it.War Dogs is a constraining comedy movie with lots of clich√©s and has only one scene that's half action, half funny on it.the most wtf moment for me all through the movie is, the appearance of Jonah Hill. He looks like an obese, over tanned Bradley Cooper. Some one like, from the future or past of Bradley's character, seriously, when Teller's character meets with Bradley's character at the bar, for the first time, for a second, i waited something like: ' hey! i'm from the future! don't do this.' etc.any way, nothing exciting, funny or compelling here, move along.",1,13,27,12 November 2016
3 Idiots," 3 Hours of Pure Torture (with weepy guys)
","first of all i'm aware of free choice. i can choose to not to watch this... thing. as a twist of things i had positive reviews from several people, i heard that this... piece is a good comedy. but this... - i can't even name it- is just a mixture of several boring and not funny sketches. There are 30 years old human beings pretending to be 18 years old students. All of a sudden they started to shake and spin. Also those men cries for nearly everything. woke up in the morning, starts crying. every possible solution for any kind of difficulties they encountered is suicide or dance. after that they cry. i agree it's their style. everybody is free to have things in the way they like but please just don't overrate it. i mean, i think transformers is awful but at least there are some cgi is going on there. man, i can't imagine i will say this. one last thing, it's unbelievably long. Although it has no story, just an idea, it transforms several different kinds: teen comedy, mystery, drama, road trip... and then they cry. at one point i thought it will never end. after that, they cry a little more...",1,23,70,30 September 2012
Steve Jobs," Second part of Jobs trilogy
","After watching this era's angry, visionary, entrepreneur's business meetings in the movie called -part one of the saga - Jobs at 2013, this year we are facing the second part of the saga: Steve Jobs. As we all saw how business meetings were bloody, this time we'll visit the product launch and marketing meetings section of, angry Steve.Like part one, part two is crafted with dialogue. Non-stop conflicts of angry Steve and world. Expect nothing more than talking people. Mission for the crowd is to understand how brilliant angry Steve and how he shaped the things by listening the conversations and carefully tracing body language.Next episode, we'll dwell into monolouges of angry Steve while he's unloading his sh*t. Long mind conversations happens inside of this brilliant mind, while peeling a health apple. Waste of time, tells nothing to the audience. How come somebody watchs -at least- Jobs and had motivation to do another, just conversation based movie about this man. Pirates of the Silicon Valley is still best film about this specific topic, there are no competitors to it. one last word, I could understand what's so weird or unacceptable about behaviours of a man, who creates his own company from nothing to a biggest company in the world. I mean, i know much terrible dudes, who owns literally nothing but treats his employee like they are waste of sperm because somebody told him that he's the Ceo of a company. Business in human world runs like this. You have to slap everybody in the face if you want what you want.very terrible movie. shame on you Mr. Boyle and if your movies will be like this, please spare Trainspotting 2 from happening.",1,23,40,23 December 2015
