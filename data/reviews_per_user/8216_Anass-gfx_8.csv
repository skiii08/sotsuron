Barry Lyndon," How can anybody hate this one ?
","Some movies - I wish there were more of them - simply look like a series of great paintings. This film has that look.

The Shawshank Redemption," What a masterpiece !!
","Where I'm I going to start , well this magnificent work of art directed by the big Frank Darabont and co-writing bu the legendary Stephen king and started by both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman was just as perfect as it allows it to lead the 250 top IMDb table, yeah ,it had everything from directing ,writing and acting until good soundtracks and cinematography ,not to mention the unforeseen twisted ending which had me blocked for what it remained from the film . the shawshank redemption was overtaken in the 95th for the benefit of Forrest Gump who was truly a masterpiece and Pulp fiction who was also out of this world but still the shawshank deserved more at least for me ,I mean it is one of few who could led me into this state of admiration and worship even and for that it's and it will always be my all time favorite film .",10,0,1,26 December 2016
