The Equalizer," Absolutely Denzel at his best !
","This movie takes you to a familiar area of the once Good Guy / Dark Past but kicks it up several notches. Denzel plays the part of an quiet gentleman, a little OCD but friendly. He has a heart, cares for people and really tries to encourage people around him while living a simple life. Then he gets ' P. O.'d ' when someone he cares about is harmed. The Dark Side comes out but with a hint of offering a peaceful resolution. The bad guys choose poorly and it's on. Now we see Denzel's capabilities which are similar to Jason Bourne, Aaron Cross, Taken, etc. You soon realize he is a former very well trained operator again, one with a heart. The entire production, directing , acting , everything is top notch. Characters are developed very well and we see fine acting at it's best. Gore and violence, yes but definitely entertaining to the max.It makes one wonder how many real people are out here that seem like just regular folks but have set aside a former life where they operated in dark places. The heroes of our world.",10,5,17,3 October 2014
Lone Survivor," Best Film
","Filmmaker Peter Berg and crew put together an awesome film. The acting was top notch. Mark Wahlberg did a great job in portraying Marcus, even with the variance in their backgrounds. Ben Foster did an absolute excellent job in performing like Axe and as a Tier one operator. Foster maintained that focused, tactical persona and it showed in every expression. All these guys showed the lighter side of Brotherhood and then into the fight of their lives. I've seen this film twice within one week. Without going into specifics, I sat with other men who operate in the environment portrayed, some were former SEAL operators, some were SWAT members. All were men that I've served with where we have been tasked to the point of a firefight. Nothing even close to the Hell Marcus and these fine men went through. The Brotherhood and team spirit that is real was shown in this film to an extreme. This film accurately depicts men, warriors, brothers, loss and humanity. This is the proper way to honor these men, show they are human and a how they are patriots.",10,4,14,18 January 2014
Prisoners," Excellent Film
","This is a fine film and the acting is excellent. This film takes us on a journey into the world of twisted individuals and how people can become very bizarre. As it unfolds you begin to realize that all these small pieces and these players are linked together. These deranged individuals then victimize children for their own ' plan ' for so called religious purposes. Enter the families of the children who can't fathom why someone would take their kids and their reactions to this stress. A basic good person suddenly becomes a wrecked shell that is driven by fear and anger to find their child. They grow more doubting of law enforcements ability to find their children, so they resort to a primitive method. This film shows how average people, never violent can become a very violent person when this pain and anguish comes upon them. It is an excellent example of stress, pain and fear becoming a driving force in decision making.",9,1,2,16 February 2014
