Hereditary," I don't get scared watching movies!!!!
",But this scared the s#$t out of me because it really makes sense! No clowns or aliens or even zombies just real possible scenarios and would explain most of the serial killers walking this earth. The acting of the lead role lady was superb and real! I'm blown away by her acting. This is one of the great horror films of all time and I'm not exaggerating. I'm no movie critic or columnist just a movie buff so don't take my word and just watch for yourself .,10,1,3,2 February 2019
