Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Vol.1 OR Vol.2?
","I saw vol.2 the other day with two friends, I loved, and enjoyed it even more so than vol.1. They are both the best films of at least the past ten years i could happily say. I was amazed that the two idiots I went with hated it. They loved vol.1 but hated vol.2. At first i didnt understand why, then they backed up there argument with comments such as 'Why didnt Bea just cut off bills head when she first walked into his house' and 'how can you kill someone by playing with there nipple', also they called it boring and said there was to much talking.hahaha. These guys made me laugh and i told them that. Now everday i cop sh#t from them at work for standing up for a great movie. All i can guess is that they only liked the violence in vol.1, not the story or the background of the film, but just the violence, which i agree has a huge part in vol.1 and i loved it as well, but its not just the violence that made this film a masterpiece. Am I stupid or did I just pick the wrong idiots to go and see such a good film with? Does anyone else agree with these d#ckheads?",Null,0,1,5 May 2004
