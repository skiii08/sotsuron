Captain Phillips," A precisely excellent piece of cinema.
","Captain Phillips is raw with a clear focus and has strong foundations. The ending is emotional and stunning. Two captains come together with completely different backgrounds with similar reasons, a livelihood. With mind games this unique relationship grows with tension flowing throughout. Captain Phillips is simple yet clever. It feels pure yet effortless, as a series of events unfold which are truly believable making it thrilling but moving at the same time. Tom Hanks is flawless, whilst Barkhad Abdi provides an unnerving edge. This movies has everything a thriller should need, an is a precisely excellent piece of cinema.",9,1,1,18 June 2019
3:10 to Yuma," Superb Tribute
",Im not usually a western watcher but I absolutely love this movie. Russell Crowe and Christian Bale are simply fantastic. They are blessed with two wonderful characters who are the focal point of the whole movie. Most of the time its a battle of their understanding for each other rather than an action movie but in the end they get the mutual appreciation they fought for and a ending the movie deserved. 3:10 to Yuma is a wonderful action drama and one which anyone can enjoy because it is just that mesmerising to watch.,9,0,0,18 June 2019
Source Code," Excellent
","Source Code brings something new to the tired train bombing plot line. Jake Gyllennhaal is superb as the main protagonist adding some real charisma to the movie. It was important that Captain Colter Stevens character was casted right due to the role he had carrying the movie. His humour, confusion and likability meant that Source Code was a real success as the story was already exciting and interesting. Although short Source Code is intelligent and rewarding, making it one of the best thrillers of recent times.",8,0,1,18 June 2019
Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3 is an exhilarating joy ride
","This movie has everything. Its funny, its full of action to the brim, it has a solid story, it has plot twists, memorable moments and above all it has a little bit of charm. The acting is superb and Robert Downey Jr rocks once again. Shane Black has saved the Iron man trilogy. After the second movie, I was worried that like the Transformers movies, there would be such a perfect first instalment that the other simply could not reach its level. I was wrong, and gladly too. Iron Man 3 is by far one of the best Marvel movies out there and is a top all rounder. From the one liners to the unfamiliar feeling of desperation for Tony Stark. The fiery AIM's weapons feel like they have been deprived from Terminators, they are fantastic and make great enemies to all of Starks suits, MK1 to 42. Iron Man 3 is an exhilarating joy ride. Watch it.",8,0,0,18 June 2019
Deepwater Horizon," Emotional and authentic
",Decent movie which really captured the disaster. It was emotional and authetic. Acting was spot on and not over the top. It was respectful whilst capturing the desperation. They did well to break down something very hard to understand for the viewers to digest,9,1,2,19 June 2019
Hereditary," Scariest Horror in a While
","Whilst the story is nothing original, the way its delivered is extremely chilling. One of the scariest horrors ive seen in a while with excellent acting.",9,4,8,24 June 2019
Se7en," This is one of my all time favourite movies
","An incredibly dark and noir thriller by David Fincher. It stars three of hollywood's best in what is a twisted mystery with some classicly memorable scenes. Right from the off, this movie sets a tone which it continues throughout with such strong performances. This is one of my all time favourite movies.",10,2,2,19 June 2019
Star Trek," Perfect introduction to Star Trek
","Shamefully this 2009 movie was pretty much my first full experience of what the Star Trek franchise has to offer. I have never been a fan and was completely new to the series. I have since begun to understand its following although I'm glad to have started with JJ Abrams remake as it was the perfect introduction. As a science fiction action movie it ticked all the boxes and had a well crafted cast which made watching this movie thoroughly enjoyable. The story is along the lines of what I expected going into it but together with its effects and smart script it was smooth and sleek. I really enjoyed learning how these characters came together and involved more action than I participated, much to my delight.",9,4,15,18 June 2019
Darkest Hour," Captivating
",Thoroughly interesting captive and gripping. Superb performance from Oldman in a excellent war drama. One of the best I've seen about a interesting time within history.,9,0,0,24 June 2019
Argo," Believe the hype
","Believe the hype. Argo is a not so heavy political adaptation of no longer classified story of great magnitude. I have little knowledge on the original story, nor do I like movies with high political connotations, its not that I don't understand them, I just don't want too. However Argo is not like that, although I was a little cautious at first Argo is a fantastically gripping series of acts from start to finish. Ben Affleck deserves all the plaudits on this one, i never expected to like this one but due to his raw talent of filmmaking as well as acting he has created a masterpiece out of a little known but technical story. The end is sheer suspense. That is due to the built up scale of terror and trouble you know these victims are in. You believe these lives to be at risk and that the odds are low, edge of the seat stuff as an audience. Terrific entertainment which is just right, in every sense.",9,1,1,18 June 2019
The Day After Tomorrow," Emmerich disaster
","Here we have yet another Roland Emmerich disaster movie, and again we're delivered a real entertaining popcorn flick. Theres plenty of action to be had and despite the scale of the destruction Roland always seems to provide a light means of drama. There is a lack of realism which is dumbed down to the fact that 50% of the movie they're trying to prove it could be true, however you cannot deny some good effects which really provides thrilling entertainment due to the grand scale of the disaster. I do enjoy disaster movies and Emmerichs movies do often feel too serious, undermined by the unbelivability. Often making his movies often hit or miss but The Day after Tomorrow is definitely somewhere in between.",7,2,2,18 June 2019
Cloverfield," Ultimate monster experience
","This is a superb monster movie. It's scary, mysterious, menacing and looks amazing. The fact it's all filmed in a video camera style is not going to be to everyone's taste but I think it adds an extra edge to the movie and makes it a more authentic experience. Whilst the characters aren't totally interesting, and a little stereo typical you feel their terror and desperation to get to friends and to safety. I love how the creature was kept a secret before release, how it teases your imagination for its existence and is completely forced upon them out of the blue. The creature itself gets screen time progresively, leaving an air of mystery but you get more than a glimpse. There are some memorable moments in this movie and its one of my favourites to rewatch.",9,2,2,18 June 2019
The Hateful Eight," Better than Django
","Solid movie, even better then Django. Bought into the humour and its characters. Funny and very gory. Enjoyed every minute of it, also had a great ending. Its tone was almost perfect and it unravelled strategically. I was captivated throughout and key parts of the film stuck me for days after. Visually stunning and funny too.",9,4,8,25 June 2019
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Winter Soldier is the best movie in the Avengers series to date
","Winter Soldier is the best movie in the Avengers series to date. Breathtaking visuals mixed with a solid storyline, energetic action sequences and they finally make a true superhero out of Captain America. On a whole it follows on nicely from both The First Avenger and Assemble. It also benefitted from the attendance of Black Widow, and also an excellent villain. The action was superb from start to finish, Captain America himself has a venerability about him with a human nature. Its just thrilling, edge of the seat stuff which puts a real punch back into the Marvels best running series to date.",9,10,12,18 June 2019
Interstellar," Boring and Flat
","Far far too long and has too many plot holes for a film trying desperately to cover every possible angle. 'Interstellar' started positively, but in soon this escalated into something which can only be applauded for its sheer cinematography and effects. The rest was quite frankly fluff ruined by poor explanations, we're led to believe this farmer was once an incredible astronaut who has to have wormholes explained to him. The twist to the movie was unfortunately clear to see from pretty much quarter of the way through which really ruined the finale. The last on screen moments also where seemed rushed and we're misguided as to what the real focus should have been. Overall the movie was mesmerising in very few places, but when done, it was done well. For the rest, it disappointed greatly, mainly being boring, flat and really lacking in memorable moments to make it the blockbuster it should have been.",5,1,4,18 June 2019
Ant-Man," Refreshing superhero movie
","Ant-Man was pretty much what I expected from the trailer but it worked very well and was a thoroughly enjoyable movie. First of all I was looking forward to seeing Paul Rudd in an action man role as I am a fan of his and boy did he do a good job. Ant-Man didn't take itself too seriously which I think was key but there was some great action and some top humour. Unfortunately I found some of the jokes miss their mark but Ant-Man was a steady almost heist movie which shows a lot of potential ahead of sequels or an Avenger performance. Im new to Ant-Man but found the superhero something a little different and likewise the movie, it was a refreshing movie in the Marvel series and posed flashbacks in similarities to the original Iron Man film.",8,0,0,18 June 2019
Predator," Classic
","Predator is a classic. For me its the epitome of 80's action movies, and much of Arnold Schwarzeneggers career. Ive seen this movie more times then I care to imagine but I still love it. If you think about it, really its not very good. The plot it undeniably thin, dialog is inexistent and its a little slow. I watch it today and every other line (albeit rarely) is cheesy and the over the top explosions unnecessary but back then it was run of the mill and probably not that stupid. I miss these types of movies that act as catapults of ideas to so many films of today. In my eyes Predator is iconic, I love the ending and the action sequences, I love its abrupt ending the over the top violence and gore. It does its job, tense, gory horror adrenaline flick. In its time the effects were brilliant but even now digitally remastered I enjoy this movie more than ever before. Yet to be critical it has huge flaws and always will, the characterisation and story could be so much better. That said would Predator be as iconic as it is today if it was more developed... get to the choppa.",8,3,6,18 June 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A classic of its time
","Visually stunning and a classic of its time. At the start of any series of films no matter how many instalments, the first will always tell the story and move you with its characters. The Fellowship of the Ring does this, and very well might i add. What lets this film down is the scenes in between the action. The action is too and far between. If I'm quite honest the action isn't actually that great. The scenes in the mines (or tombs) are by far the best however the time spent in riven dale and others on the quests are just plain boring. Some of the dialect can also just be pointless in these scenes. I think the casting is fantastic however. Ian McKellen a standout alongside Viggo Mortensen. I understand the characterisation behind the hobbits and how there place in the story is to be our own, far from home, against all the odds, great courage, fear. However Frodo and his shire compatriots are just too winy. I find Frodo in particular just irritating. The score, the stores, its directing and certain tension building is undeniably brilliant and worth all its accolades. The rating reflects what I portray as weaknesses to the first film in this timeless trilogy.",7,1,4,18 June 2019
Man of Steel," A refreshing reboot nonetheless but definitely not ground breaking
","Man of Steel was disappointing. Although decent, it fell short of its hype. It boasts a better re-telling of Supermans background, including a superb beginning to the movie. Also there is undeniably amazing effects here with more destruction than you could imagine. However, the action sequences became boring very quickly. Smashing through walls and getting up again was soon dull and disinteresting. This was not aided by a terribly casted villain who's given cheesy lines. Henry Cavill wasn't much better, obviously cast for his good looks, buff body and constant frown. There was a sense of grand scale but never did it feel remotely threatening or tense. In fact, for the most part it was emotionless but for his relationship with his two sets of parents. Man of Steel was a refreshing reboot nonetheless but it definitely wasn't ground breaking.",5,0,0,18 June 2019
The Revenant," Visually Striking
","The revenant is visually striking with beautiful scenery and carefully thought shots. It has some of the most tense and gut wrenching moments ever seen in film. The determination and fight is really captured throughout, its worth mentioning it has a strong start and rewarding end. However I did also feel the movie was unecessaryly long. Many moments were dragged out which caused the second half of the movie to become a tad boring. Its most definately worth a watch though.",8,0,1,23 June 2019
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Iconic
","Terminator 2 is iconic, Even now its a superb watch, ageing fairly well. Its a movie that does so many things well, its gripping and scary in its own way. There is a sense of dread, running away from an unstoppable force. The coming together of these two machines is timed well, giving space to set up a grand finale. There are many memorable moments topped by famous music and recognisable lines. Terminator 2 will always be one of the best movies of all time and deserves to be watched for generations to come. Its almost so full of intent that it becomes powerful, whilst thankfully rich in entertainment, beginning to end.",9,0,0,18 June 2019
Disturbia," Likable Horror
","Disturbia is a very likeable horror movie which contains Shia LaBeoulf's best ever performance. Its a silly concept, but its original and although full of cliches the suspense is well built. Its a movie I've seen on a few occasions and still provides some solid entertainment. The ending does go back on itself in terms of potent slow build up but in another sense it does reach a dramatic climax which is quite satisfying. Its a tidy, smart and well acted affair which can be enjoyed by a wide audience.",7,0,0,18 June 2019
Silver Linings Playbook," Pure brilliance!
","I thought this movie was pure brilliance! I found it so powerful and gut wrenching in parts, I really felt for the characters. Pat and Tiffany are damaged, you feel that however against all the odds they fix each other. 'Silver Lining Playbook' has such beautiful morals and ideologies. It went from the depths of really low points of Pats life to the moment we were all praying for. I think this was drama more than comedy but the wonderful thing is you found yourself laughing when you didn't realise it, almost feeling embarrassed to finding things funny about difficult people with such serious problems. The jokes are subtle but I went through all sorts of emotions watching this, bravo to all that went into making this, they deserve all the credit they received. Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro especially were unbelievable. A rare and first 5 star review from me.",10,1,1,18 June 2019
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Witch Hunt
","I can understand the movies poor reception and reviews however its one of those movies which you can't help but enjoy anyway. Its extremely fast, witty and has an unprecedented amount of gore. The action is plenty full and it has a simple storyline that plays on a classic fairytale. Although it has a serious tone it doesn't take itself seriously. Instead we get a fun, gruesome and entertaining action/horror movie. Arterton and Renner are strong in there roles and the witches are imaginative but familiar. Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunter makes good use of its cast, creates some bloody mess all in a really fantasied and exacerbated 19th century.",6,3,3,18 June 2019
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Octane fun
","The latest instalment in the Mission Impossible franchise follows its impeccable trend to improve with time. Even when it didn't seem possible Rogue Nation out wits itself with a devastating amount of action and intelligent writing. The plot takes many twists and turns, its never difficult to follow yet a 2 hr movie feels like a 4 hr movie, not in a bad way either. It manages to pack such a detailed and analytical story into what could to prove the hollywood movie of 2015. Its smart, sophisticated, the action is brutal and plentiful. It has pretty much everything. It does cut out some of the humour but what it replaces it with is superb, the enemy feels threatening, you feel the magnitude and its oh so satisfying. Once more Tom Cruise is the consistent action hero who only becomes more likeable, he's backed up by brilliant on screen team as they pretty much blow us away. A note also to some sublime shots and editing in the most octane action sequences, they make the unbelievable seem believable and almost through the eyes of Ethan Hunt himself.",9,0,0,18 June 2019
Dunkirk," Emotional
",A very good movie which captures the emotion and pressure of critical moments of the historical event. It looks and sounds stunning too. The timeframe Nolan uses is unnesscary and adds nothing to the movie. Overall I think the critics are going over the top in what is a good not brilliant movie. Its slow at times and a film you'd only want to see once. Don't rush to the cinema to see it but do watch it at some point.,8,1,3,23 June 2019
The Machinist," Superb
","Never has a set of mind, a feeling of guilt and suffering been depicted in such a brilliant art form as Brad Anderson has done here with The Machinist. This deeply troubling and disturbing movie covers all nightmares of a confused and paranoid mind, in such a way that it is unmissable. The tone and suspense captures the audiences attention from the moment it begins as you live inside the mind of Trevor Reznik who is dealing with a guilty conscience and a dark secret. The way this story is told with every shot so detailed, every second gives a clue and speaks volumes. An incredible performance by Christian Bale makes for one of the most fantastic artistic movies of all time. Superb.",9,2,3,18 June 2019
The Amazing Spider-Man," Unnecessary reboot?
","The amazing spiderman was an unnecessary reboot but I'm glad its come about anyway. Spiderman has always been a cheesy and weak superhero tale for me however this new take on the web slinger is invigorating. The focus on his parents is new, as is the new love interest, both worked but what worked more is Andrew Garfield as spiderman. In now way is he a believable geek, Tobey Maguire is a better Peter Parker but Garfield is a better Spiderman in more ways then one. He's funny and cool, everything a super hero should be. More importantly he's genuine, he brings some reality to the role. Mark Webb has done a superb job in re-creating spiderman and creating new paths to explore in an otherwise plain story.",7,0,4,18 June 2019
The Lego Movie," Do not make the mistake in putting this one down before you see it.
","A fantastic animation with a wonderful touch. There have been some incredible family movies over the years and more recently disneys 'Frozen' however going into this with low expectations, they were blown out of the water. What a great movie for everyone to enjoy, its high tempo for the whole thing with a clever and imaginative storyline. After finding success in the gaming industry recently the LEGO has reinvented itself with this movie. Its colourful, funny and more importantly...creative. Do not make the mistake in putting this one down before you see it.",9,2,3,18 June 2019
American History X," Jaw dropping drama
","American History X is a jaw dropping drama. It provides a powerful take on racism and its effect on peoples lives, its violent through words and actions. There are moments of devastation and even some with disbelief. Its full of hatred and delivers a strong message. Edward Norton delivers by far the best performance of his career and was truly compelling to watch, you know that it must have been a difficult role to portray. The ending to this masterpiece is shocking, as if the audience isn't rocked enough. Superb.",8,0,0,18 June 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Epic but deserving
","So its all come down to this. I had my hunches on what was going to transpire. Some of it was correct but it was delivered well. In fact, really well. The film is long, too long. However, I rarely clock watched despite a feeling of being quite slow early on. It has an epic start and finish although the middle feels different to the usual. Thats not a bad thing. Im not the biggest superhero movie fan, I'm a little tired of the overused formulas. I think its a miracle they made this work having all superheros together at once, they did well. Overall though I cant escape the feeling of unevenness and feeling cheated by some of the abilities of the superheroes which do not feel even or equal out fairly on screen. Theres little feeling of tension as a result or dread. I didn't care for the characters enough in comparison to say the Dark Knight Trilogy. Its a good movie, no doubt about it but not sure its worth its absolute plaudits.",8,0,2,2 July 2019
Alien vs. Predator," Could have been better
","Alien Vs Predator is a fairly good watch if you can forget the superb standalone movies and enjoy it for what it is. It starts slow, we enter a familiar plot line and listen to the same excuses. However the clash between these two film icons is impressive. You get a closer look at the Aliens whilst the battles between them are engaging. If only there were more of them it could have been better. AvP has a decent enough ending too, theres no doubt that this was a bit of fun cross over and it did work but it certainly could have been better.",5,0,0,18 June 2019
District 9," Fantastic
","District 9 is quite fantastic. It brings a spin to your quite ordinary alien invasion story with great stylisation and camera work. Its almost artistic but acts a great piece of sci-fi action too. District 9 tells its story in a believable way and is captivating. The unknown Sharlto Copley plays a brilliant role alongside imaginative and well designed aliens called prawns. This movie is intelligent, bold and unique. Its a film which you can watch and admire.",8,0,0,18 June 2019
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Incredible entertainment
","Incredible entertainment. The Desolation of Smaug was every bit as epic as An Unexpected Journey, if not more so. The scene Peter Jackson sets is one of sheer beauty but terror at the same time. The action sequences are just so fantastic I saw in awe, they make sitting down for nearly 3 hours every bit of worth it. The grand finale of this movie was fascinating to watch, Smaug a worthy enemy. I cannot wait to watch the final movie of this wonderful trilogy. Its all making sense and tying in nicely with the originals. I hope people don't diminish all standing of my review for this film when I say, I'm enjoying the Hobbit trilogy more than the Lord of the Rings. That alone should be a statement at how great this movie is.",9,0,3,18 June 2019
Toy Story 4," Consistently Brilliant
","Here we go again, the gang is back and I'm going to be completely bias because I grew up with these films and they played a huge role within my childhood. This film is just perfect. Its got heart and humour, superb animation and a fabulous story. The story is perfect for families. Full of good morales but great for those older like me who can relate due to the parallel timeline of these releases to my life. Its the perfect kind of humour. The film is completely charming and introduces excellent new characters. Its a bit lighter than the third movie but still has an attachment of emotional moments. This is bound to be one of the best movies of the year. Its unmissable.",10,6,12,4 July 2019
Batman Begins," Start of something special
","Batman Begins is the start of an incredible revival of the caped crusaders story. Taken from the comics, Christian Bale's portrayal is fresh and brings a darker side to the Batman franchise. It explains the birth of the superhero in depth with plenty of action sequences. Michael Caine is also fantastic as Bruce Waynes' trusty butler. Cillian Murphy is chilling as Scarecrow who's character adds to the darkness, making Batman for the adults. Nolans first take in the trilogy is visually stunning, Gotham the gothic icon in its true form. There is also a laugh to be had in a perfectly balanced movie.",9,0,0,18 June 2019
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Fantastic Family Fun
","Well this is a fantastic family movie. I never expected it to be as good as the first but it might even be better. Firstly the animation is superb, it was fascinating to watch and you seen subtle signs of how the characters have aged. What I loved about the first is how its story is told, there is a wonderful continuation here with some new ideas which fit in perfectly without feeling forced. There is a typical good vs evil base plot to entertain the little ones whilst theres more emotional moments to really make this movie stand out and live strong in your memory. As a sequel its more mature, yet still cute and funny with enough imagination and fun for everyone to really enjoy.",9,2,2,18 June 2019
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Unique and fun to watch
","The Grand Budapest Hotel is a unique movie. Its artistically shot, almost looks like a Cadbury's advert, the cast is breathtaking despite the short appearances of some and the script, simply genius. Its by far one of the funniest movies Ive watched this year, which is helped by quite brilliant relationship between Zero and Gustave. At times it feels like its been edited to look like a silent movie and the grandness and colour is used effectively to be so pleasing on the eye creating a sense of wonder about this odd story. It is a strange movie but will be enjoyed by all.",9,0,1,18 June 2019
It Follows," Superb horror
","It follows sounds like your usual teen horror flick with a group of stupid friends putting themselves in difficult situations. But not here this movie has a different type of direction with a bold artistic and visual style. Its a basic plot, simply told with menacing sense of horror which works very well. A thoroughly good movie smartly told",7,0,1,18 June 2019
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Superb Entry
","My knowledge of Planet of the Ages franchise is basic however I thought this prequel was brilliant. The overall story is interesting and the telling of its beginning is just mesmerising. The start of Rise of the Planet of the Apes is little short of superb and emotional but the evolution of this animal as well as his character was terrifically done. I thought the CGI was also very impressive but towards the end of this movie it strayed towards silly, saving itself at the right moment. As the movie progresses you can predict where the plot line goes but the way it plays out is exciting and exhilarating enough to capture the audience opening itself up to a sequel.",9,1,1,18 June 2019
Gone Girl," Sick and Twisted
","Gone Girl is sick and twisted. Wonderfully dark yet grotesquely brutal. A worringly realistic representation of a marriage on the rocks with two secretive and unstable characters. Both acted to the very highest level. This roller coaster of a movie plays on a perfectly plotted stage, medias power and the strength of a broken man. One thing let this movie down, its ending. After twists, turns and shocks I was expecting so much more from its finale. A miscarriage to what was a perfect build up. For this it lost half a star however this was regained due to raw and electrifying acting from Affleck and Pike. Plus equally majestic directing from the master of mystery thriller movies, David Fincher.",8,0,1,18 June 2019
The Theory of Everything," Beautiful and Inspiring
","A beautiful story has been told through the eye of the camera, the adapted novel taught me more of the fascinating life of Steven Hawking. I found it incredible to live through the believable telling of Hawkings emotional existence in the theory of everything. The equilibrium was just wonderful and I found the whole movie powerful. The reflection of Hawkings character, the source of humour and unique brilliance was excellent. The connection and understanding of a rare relationship was delivered with the highest quality. Its also important to note Eddie Redmaynes contribution to this movie, acting with complete soul and dedication. Marvellous to watch and whilst it felt like prying into this personal yet superb story, I felt inspired.",9,0,1,18 June 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The Two Towers is a masterpiece
","Winy Frodo is back but thankfully he is not the star of the show this time round. The Two Towers is a masterpiece. A cinema triumph, the key to the epic trilogy. The war has begun and the battle of helms deep is astounding. The action sequences are unlike any other, they are powerful. This is what we have been building up for, fellowship only set the tone and built the armies. The Two Towers has an eiry tone of pure atmospheric genius. You can feel the devastation created by Saruman and Sauron on a global scale. Men, women and families at there mercy, hope is all they have and its waring thin. The trilogy picked up where it left up at a much quicker pace, continuing to take the audience down the broken fellowships paths. It comes together wonderfully and there is little to fault, Peter Jackson has nailed it. Its a exciting and emotional journey as it takes centre stage, you will never see a better final third of a movie, ever.",9,0,0,18 June 2019
The Mist," Solid Horror
","The mist is a solid horror movie which is simple and original. It builds its horror on the instability of troubled minds. You can see real character work and its by far its strengths. The acting is okay, I think there could have been better casting and the creatures at first didn't seem very well designed but as the film grows your understanding of them does. The mist does well to build tension and theres a fair amount of gore too. It feels real through pure fear and emotion which puts it above many of todays horrors alone. It feels like a classic but this is no doubt down to Stephen King's wonderful mind.",8,0,1,18 June 2019
I Am Legend," It strays a little to far
","I am Legend is a great movie. It won't be too everyones taste and is inarguably slow, but for good reason. Its a beautiful movie in a strange sort of way and although short of cast it makes up in the sense of relationship between a broken and lonely man with the one thing he has left. You feel the sense of disaster quickly and its bold however all the way through I got a feeling that something was missing. Not a lot happens but there are some emotional and heartfelt moments to make up for this. There is also some thought provoking moments to create the idea of what Nevilles situation would really be like. Although the plot is simple and short its effective, this is mainly down to the way it was shot. The major plus of this movie is Will Smith, he is superb. He acts incredibly and takes his role to another dimension. The major flaw happens to be its lack of loyalty to its source, Richard Matheson's novel. It strays a little to far in my opinion.",6,0,0,18 June 2019
Men in Black II," Passes the time
","Men in Black 2 in comparison with the first and third is drab. It was impossible to predict how wrong it went following the success of the first instalment. Admittedly difficult to live up too, its no excuse for what was dished up to us here. MIB 2 provided us with a recycled format from the first film, and the jokes were not on par. The action and originality from the first was missing, along with its charm. Although the first was almost perfect, this was a really lazy attempt of a sequel, yet still it passed the time and will be popular amongst the younger kids.",5,0,0,18 June 2019
The Imitation Game," A truthfully wonderful movie
",Superb movie with solid acting. Difficult subject to cover but manages so very egmatically through great story telling. It tells quite an astonishing but sad story really. A truthfully wonderful movie,9,0,1,18 June 2019
Jurassic World," Blockbuster ending
","Im an avid fan of Jurassic Park and was so excited for this sequel. It didn't disappoint either, I feel they played safe with a similar style to the original classic which was fine by me cause it did enough differently for it to be appreciated. Rather than match the suspense of the original it when gung ho on action and effects with a huge screen time for dinosaurs which is what we all came to watch. It was a little corny here and there but i think it saved itself with playing on that a couple times to not take itself too seriously. I loved how they incorporated the original into the story too and thought the ending was breathtakingly good. Good show from the actors, especially Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, the child actors where a weak link but overall this is a fantastic blockbuster movie.",9,0,1,18 June 2019
Hotel Transylvania," Hotel Transylvania is seriously underrated
","Hotel Transylvania is seriously underrated. I laughed several times at the references and animations which were just mesmerising. It has a solid background story, plays on boring stereotypes rather than taking them literally. Strangely it felt fresh, this is one the whole family can enjoy. Everything about it is just right, it even has a rewarding ending. Fantastic visuals, laugh out loud jokes and I'm amazed to say even with Adam Sandler in the casting, the voice acting was top notch. Judging the casting before watching was a huge mistake, its clear that its a mismatch of who I wish were nobodies but together they brought some energy and excitement to match the visuals.",7,0,1,18 June 2019
The Dark Knight," Best Superhero Film of All Time
","The Dark Knight is the absolute peak of not only Nolans trilogy but of all the Batman franchise. In fact , its the best superhero movie there has been and one of, if not my all time favourite movie. Heath Ledgers take on iconic villain The Joker is simply breathtaking and its a crying shame he could not take the plaudits. Bale, Caine, Freeman and Oldman all excel once more, although unfortunately I feel Maggie Gyllenhaal did not match Katie Holmes' performance. That is the only negative I have in what is a near perfect movie. Goyers writing is enthralling and Nolans shooting is breathtaking. Nolans ability to continually build the tempo from various moments using the stories pacing, faster shooting and Hans Zimmers composing sent chills to my spine. The movie once again sent you through a series of emotions and deserves every bit of credit is received.",10,1,1,18 June 2019
Toy Story," The best movie of my childhood
","The best movie of my childhood. Captured the imagination of myself and billions of others, this movie influenced my childhood and was a terrific movie. Nothing has changed, this movie remains strong and still holds up today. Its a beautiful story which is totally ingenious. I will be showing this movie to my children and I hope it remains a part of childhood for many for generations to come.",10,0,0,19 June 2019
Men in Black," Its captivating, hilarious and action packed
","I truly admire this movie for all its worth, its ability to entertain such a wide audience. Theres something for the children and the adults. Men in Black is a classic. Its captivating, hilarious and action packed. Nobody saw this bursting on the scene, and it delivers its own personal style. It has some really unique and intelligent elements which spark a superb series of movies. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith flow and compliment each other brilliantly. Well structured and a masterpiece of creation, including a new world, visual style and an action/sci-fi/comedy genre. Brilliant.",9,1,1,18 June 2019
Elysium," Solid action with similarities to District 9
","I can see the resemblance to District 9 in story and style however I don't feel this is a weakness. Elysium is immensely entertaining. The action is fantastic and the story solid. Sharlto Copley I feel wasn't as well casted for his role unlike in District 9. Matt Damon played a superb role and Jodie Foster was also convincing. Overall Elysium has brilliant pacing and never bores. Great action sequences in this almost beautiful story of two worlds shadowing each other, the tension mounts later on reaches a conclusive end.",7,0,2,18 June 2019
Mama," Mama Mia
","Best horror movie I've seen in a long time. Its chilling and haunting, yet at the same time its got some backbone, a story to go with it. Yes your looking at creepy ghosts in the closet, haunted houses in the woods blah blah. Its no lie that its all been done a thousand times before, but its done cause those things are spooky. Its always going to be hard to make an original horror movie, however Mama is substantial and consistent throughout. Its a very good modern day horror with a scary mother's worst nightmare theme. After some good building in tension and a few cheap jumpy moments it DOES unfortunately loose its fear factor towards the end but it has a rewarding ending to make up for it. An enjoyable watch, horror movies rarely for me are worth watching but this has its scares, a story, good ending and acting. So watch it, mums the word.",8,0,0,18 June 2019
Zero Dark Thirty," Fantastic piece of work
","I did not expect to enjoy this as much as I actually did. With its length, complicated nature and incredible detail Zero Dark Thirty was a fantastic piece of work. Jessica Chastain was brilliant in the convincing centre piece of the narrative. It was long, starting strong, losing credit towards the middle but the final hour was terrific. Right down to the raid which was full of suspense and drama. Like the raid itself, it was a precise and scintillating piece of cinema. In the end it felt worth it, I have little interest in the context of its accuracies of the actual events, nor its controversy. In the scheme of things I watched for entertainment, and it delivered. If you're in the mood for something dramatic with a serious tone, watch Zero Dark Thirty.",8,9,13,18 June 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," One of the best movies of 2014
","Edge of Tomorrow is everything a sci-fi movie should be, explosive and inventive. The action wasn't just in huge quantity but of the highest quality too. Managing to avoid too many cliche's and creating something really interesting to accompany the slick action sequences. The plots formula is similar to that of Source Code but in very different circumstances. Pacing to this futuristic war zone is perfection and although it has unanswered questions on its wider background it focuses on the elements pivotal to the movies structure, enabling it to a success. Tom Cruise is proven in his role but his relationship with Emily Blunt is brilliant together with Edge of Tomorrows sharpness, energy and humour its one of the best movies of 2014 so far.",9,1,2,18 June 2019
Whiplash," Intense
","Whiplash is simply stunning. Its easy to see why the screenplay was blacklisted and the movie nominated for numerous awards. JK Simmons too is deserving of all awards after an intense performance. This movie is electrifying, emotional and is genuine edge of the seat stuff. Its a compact movie with a high quality level of drama, every moment captured is excellent. Miles Teller was superb in his draining role, his experience of ambition is dark and testing. The finale was strong and outwitted itself, so much so that Whiplash will endeavour to be one of my favourite movies of the year for its climatic spectacle of entertainment.",10,0,0,18 June 2019
The Wrestler," Rourke and Aronofsky deserve every ounce of praise.
","The Wrestler is gripping and powerful from start to finish. Mickey Rouke was born for the role and in one word was sensational. You felt his pain and sorrow but also his love for the sport. At times his character was desperate without breaking down, The Ram was instantly likeable. He and his portrayal was real, raw and full of emotion. The end to this movie was simply perfect and this drama had impeccable timing throughout, never growing old. To begin to understand this character despite the inability to relate to his situations is just brilliant cinema and precise script. Rourke and Aronofsky deserve every ounce of praise.",9,1,1,18 June 2019
Kong: Skull Island," Fun!
",Kong was completely unexpected and wipes the floor of the Peter Jackson version. Its totally brutal with lots of action. The creature designs stunning and lots of memorable moments. Super monster movie which you crave more of.,9,0,1,23 June 2019
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A deserving ending to a wonderful trilogy.
","A deserving ending to a wonderful trilogy. The Hobbit movies are not as dark as the LOTR, they are a little more charming and easy to follow. This does not take away from the grand scale of this movies world or the beauty of its tale. The Battle of the Five Armies started as it intended to end, the action sequences were again excellent and creative. There were many memorable moments which were both intelligent and spectacular. I never found it slow and the battles were indeed dramatic however it seems Peter Jacksons ideas have become a little more predictable when you constantly know whats coming at big moments. I love the home grown talent within this trilogy and it tied in beautifully with the LOTR. One of my favourite trilogies of all time",9,1,3,18 June 2019
The Conjuring," Conjuring is disturbing
","I usually find the horror genre a little boring but James Wans work is often thoroughly entertaining, he's one of the masters of modern horror movies. The Conjuring is disturbing I didn't find it very scary but it was very uncomfortable. This is down to a indescribable atmosphere that is created, often the case with Wans work such as Insidious. An impressive cast assisted a somewhat predictable plot and theme which has been done over, however rarely has it been delivered with such quality. You believe the fear and give into the terror not really knowing is coming next. The Conjuring is satisfying and will not be easy for people to watch, because its done well.",9,0,1,18 June 2019
The Woman in Black," Chilling and unnerving
","The Woman in Black as a book is one of all time favourites, a chilling story written by Susan Hill. For this adaption to be a success it had to stay true to its source, and for the most part it did. Watkins did leave out and tweak a few things, for the better? Im not so sure, however as it story it was still rewarding. As for directing, he managed to replicate many of the chills through atmosphere and general spooks. They were a little cliche but as good as it possibly could get. I thought Daniel Radcliffe did well in his role although not overly convinced. Without reading the book I feel this movie will come across as very generic and predicable but I felt it was still chilling and unnerving.",7,0,1,18 June 2019
The Dark Knight Rises," Superb Finale to Incredible Trilogy
","A truly epic finale to the Nolan Dark Knight trilogy. This is the ending the trilogy deserved and is a thrilling ride which delivers a drastic scale of highs and lows. A thrilling ride from beginning to end which is beautifully designed and shot. Rises is by far the most passionate and deepest. This time round Bane is the villain who tests Batman physically and we are given the impression throughout that he is a true threat to Gotham. At no point does batman feel like a comic book superhero, the movie is raw and electrifying. Rises doesn't play on morals as much as its predecessor nor is it as mentally stimulating. Instead it gets darker and more emotional. I am sad to see the end of The Dark Knight but this will live on to be one of the best trilogies ever made.",10,1,1,18 June 2019
Casino Royale," Bonds back
","Casino Royale is a fantastic re-imagining of the bond franchise completely reviving it bringing more class and sophistication to the table. Daniel Craig is an epitome of that, taking James Bonds character forward with a more raw personality that is honest, arrogant and genuine. The story itself is suspenseful with its own twists and turns and has all that you expect from a traditional bond movie yet feeling completely fresh with less tacky gadgetry and more intelligence. The woman in bonds arm is this time a story of love and lost, a source for all anger and direction for the movies to come in the franchise. Overall its a fantastic watch, one you have to be in the mood to watch compared to the 007 of old which is more of a popcorn flick, a bold move in the right direction.",9,2,6,18 June 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," An Awakening
","Im not a particularly a big fan of the Star Wars franchise. For a long time I found the Revenge of the Sith the most enjoyable of the lot. A New Hope and Return of the Jedi were probably the best of the series in terms of story, tone and humour. Thats until now. Screw nostalgia, the only thing which made the originals good is the time of its release and how revolutionary the trilogy was. The Revenge of the Sith had far much more action and story progression. But The Force Awakens blows it out of the water for action. Humour is a little more grown up and much less cheesy. It does seem like the same old rebels attach the spaceship scene which was the focal point of new hope and empire strikes back. And another lovechild turns bad so for originality its lacking in the plot. It does have a good tone in terms of the legend of the force and all the stories of the great battle. The First Order has emerged welcomingly however and I look forward to a much more grown up series with action like this one.",9,5,47,19 June 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A fantastic end to one of the best trilogies of all time
","A fantastic end to one of the best trilogies of all time. A spectacular masterpiece in writing by Tolkien and equally fantastic achievement bringing it to the big screen. This was a worthy ending, full of drama and action. As the epic reached its peak it was a joy to see this story come to its close. From start to finish it was exhilarating. This is perfect narrative and perfect cinema. The Return of the King is so well balanced, and action sequences are again enthralling. Its difficult to choose between this and Two Towers but this could be the best in the trilogy just for nailing every aspect of what makes Peter Jacksons LOTR so great.",9,0,0,18 June 2019
The Purge," Inventive idea
","The Purge involves a pretty inventive idea which could spark various excuses for some horror or thriller plot lines. Despite political arguments, for innovation, the purge receives 5 stars. However where it goes wrong is going down the typical lockdown in a house, in darkness with a family to protect against masked lunatics. Its been done over, to couple it with this superb idea is madness. After a strong start it dwindles out to an average jump out of nowhere fest. There is a bout of pure violence which was enjoyable however it became a little cheap and the ending felt too improper after all that had happened. It built some decent tension through the chilling idea backing it however it turned out as an average horror movie. I feel if the situation is rehashed for possible purge sequels it could definitely be a success.",7,0,1,18 June 2019
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," This is the start of the rebellion.
","Novel to big screen masterpiece. Captures the emotion and desperation of the story beautifully with some brilliant performances from the cast of the not so up to scratch predecessor. I have read the books, they are fantastic, however the first instalment was a poor film. The second totally caught me off guard, I left amazed. I gasps several times during the movie, it really is an emotional roller coster. I do have one criticism, due to the peak of emotions in the storyline it was difficult to fit it all into a 2 and half hour film. Which often meant key moments in the book were slightly rushed but its understandable. Thoroughly enjoyed it, definitely the best book. It forgets the cheesy pansyness of the first film and digs into the fascination and breathtakingly depressing plot. This is the start of the rebellion.",9,0,1,18 June 2019
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Kingsman is well worth a watch, although nothing unique
","Kingsman the secret service is very funny, genuinely funny and will undoubtedly make you laugh. Colin Firth and Mark Strong are excellent, in what is a typical spy movie. Its laurels lie on playing on the spy theme, and the recycled recruitment stage of a new spy much like films such as 'Stormbreaker'. Unfortunately the threat and plot of this movie is nothing special either however where it excels is providing the unexpected. The humour and directing is very Edgar Wright and the action very straight forward and gruesome like Quentin Tarantino's work. Kingsman is well worth a watch, although nothing unique its very entertaining.",8,0,0,18 June 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," Bizarrely Stunning
",This is my first experience of the Mad Max franchise and had much to learn about its story. This movie taught me all i needed to know and its a bizarre world full of character and stunning imagery. Its a strange movie but one that keeps up an impeccable pace and is full of brutal action. Really the whole movie feels like one massive racing scene and on reflection not much happens but the full 2 hours is a fully entertaining adrenaline rush. Im positive this is a movie which can be enjoyed by all due to its unique style and extensive entertainment value.,9,1,5,19 June 2019
Jurassic Park," Will forever blow my mind
","This is one of my favourite movies of all time. Its a complete classic with the most memorable moments of pure brilliance. Its effects, state of the art then, still hold up today. More importantly the spine tingling cinema that is Jurassic Park still haunts me today with two of the best scenes of all time. The score too is iconic and phenomenal. This movie is timeless, I still love it today and can see generations after mine still finding the same wonder and awe as I did as a child. Jurassic Park is Spielbergs finest moment, a precise and suspenseful movie based around a wonderful novel. Jurassic Park will forever blow my mind.",10,3,3,18 June 2019
