The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Too Cute to Be a Wallflower
","This film is full of attractive young actors portraying high school kids, seemingly from affluent families based on their 'secret Santa' gifts. Charlie, played by Logan Lerman, is a freshman with a great deal of sadness in his life because he had a favorite aunt, played by Melanie Lynsky, whose life was a tragedy; and a best friend who committed suicide.In fact, Charlie, while intelligent and loved by his family, seemed to be oddly normal for a kid with such a long history of mental problems, for example, 'seeing people.' I was confused as to why Charlie's sister, Candace, snubbed Charlie at school knowing how lonely he was, as compared to how loving and concerned she was at home. Also, the relationship between Sam and Patrick was not believable. How likely is it that two step-siblings would be equally quirky, empathetic, the same age, equally fashionable, compatible, and hang out together? Ezra Miller was amazing, and had too little screen time. In fact, I found myself unsympathetic to any of the characters because, other than Charlie and Patrick, all those kids seemed to have a good time all the time. The character of Mary Elizabeth just seemed like a different version of Sam, because the actresses playing those characters favor each other enough to be related.The script seemed very dis-jointed, as if the writer didn't want to delve too deeply into any one subject. The flashbacks to Aunt Helen were distracting, and the little boy actor who played little Charlie wasn't as cute as the grown up Charlie. The parents all seemed very uninvolved with their kids, and didn't seem to have a purpose. The film did explore the issue of being a gay male teenager and being betrayed by the poser, but only briefly.It seems like the theme of misfits finding each other has been done before and has been done better. And one lingering question I have is, if Charlie had been in therapy all those years, why did he only remember repressed memories when he entered his first year of high school? and then, why did he race for a kitchen knife the first time he's left alone at home, and if he's that unstable, why wasn't he locked up? It just seems like the writers thought they would just throw mud at a wall and see what sticks, but nothing too deep. And that whole issue about what song was playing as they drove through the tunnel drove me crazy.Lightly entertaining. Great performances by Ezra Miller and Logan Lerman. Joan Cusack's 3 minutes of screen time was reassuring.",5,4,7,13 February 2013
The Hunger Games," Nobody seemed hungry
","I love movies, and was really looking forward to seeing the Hunger Games. I had seen all the trailers, all the interviews with the actors, and read most of the critic's reviews. I was so bored. Jennifer Lawrence is a good actress, and just comes across as likable and down to earth. She's also unusual looking and natural, so she's believable as Katniss Everdeen. Gale is just obviously so must better looking than Peeta, there is no competition and there was no chemistry between Katniss and Peeta whatsoever, or if there was I didn't sense it. Katniss seemed to pity Peeta, and it didn't help matters that Katniss was taller than Peeta, like a big sister and little brother. I loved watching Stanley Tucci more than any other actor. Donald Sutherland seemed barely awake. Wes Bentley was just pretty to look at...those EYES. Woody Harrelson as the tortured soul wore me out with his anger and disappointment. Elizabeth Banks was supposed to be annoying as Effie and she was. Casting could've been better. Too much time in the same place...the forest. I found myself looking at my watch and wishing it was over. And, though there were references to hunting for food, and 'make sure they don't starve,' nobody looked hungry or skinny or very concerned about food, event when there were tables full of lustrous desserts. Maybe my expectations were too high, but it just seems like the characters were one dimensional, the story wasn't explained very well, and the settings were without visual variance. The costumes were interesting...as if everyone was trying to out-weird each other. Then, in the next scene, they would dress Katniss in a traditional gown, minimal make up, elegant hair. So...not clear on what the fashion trends of the times were in this movie. The 'fire' was genius, and I would've enjoyed seeing more of those types of visual effects. Maybe the sequel will be better. Maybe the books are better.",5,6,14,4 April 2012
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Even Monsters Love Their Children
","Having only recently viewed The Boy in the Striped Pajamas after putting it off several times due to an aversion to holocaust films, I found myself renting the DVD based on my enjoyment of the past works of the talented cast of actors. It is true that this movie is difficult to watch, and had it been made more realistic, would likely have been watched less. In a cultural environment where beautiful costumes, special effects, and happy endings yield big profits for film makers, and big trophies with notoriety for actors, making and acting in a film like The Boy in the Striped Pajamas requires a great deal of courage on the part of the cast and crew. I was surprised by the harsh review from the New York Times, and no longer view that reviewer as credible. For me, this movie succeeded in illustrating the quiet evil of the holocaust - the worst kind of horror possible - the quiet, calm, understated kind that incrementally pervades until it's accepted as the NORM, then gets close enough to JUMP OUT and suffocate the screams of the victims. In this movie, Innocence is personified by little Bruno (played brilliantly by Asa Butterfield, small and wide eyed, and Evil is personified by Bruno's father (played by a remote and expressionless David Thewlis), a German career officer who is committed to his military duty and Party loyalty demonstrated by doing bad things to innocent people. Berlin is beautiful, but ugly things are going on in the middle of Berlin's streets, as Jews are being loaded into army trucks amidst German children running and playing on a sunny afternoon. Bruno's mother, Elsa (played with restraint and dignity by Vera Farmiga) is a loving mother who wants to protect the innocence of her two children, yet, despite her nervousness, she is forced to ignore the brutal treatment of an elderly Jewish servant being bludgeoned in her own home during dinner with her children present. Lieutenant Kotler (played by the elegant Rupert Friend) is the release valve for the building tension in the movie, as a sadistic brute who is prone to change from being conversationally affable to psychotic in .5 seconds, striking like a snake. This film is full of extreme contrasts layered one on top of one another, giving the viewer hope, then no hope for each character, until the end when the viewer realizes there is no hope for anyone because those who are NOT innocent are as doomed as those who ARE innocent. This movie is mild compared to some movies about the Holocaust, yet equally grave in exploring the possibility of turning the tables. Here is this affluent German family, with servants and chauffeurs moving to their new country home, next to a 'farm,' inhabited by 'farmers' wearing striped pajamas, where an unpleasant smell permeates the air now and again. And though the audience can see a flicker of realization in the eyes of each character, the audience will also witness the unmistakable danger of cognitive dissonance creeping around in the midst of this otherwise good German family, under the constant scrutiny of the 'party,' so that no character asks too many questions, but slips under the comforting blanket of denial while thousands of lives slip away silently over on the 'farm' a hundred or so yards away. In this movie, those who believe they are fighting monsters realize they have become monsters, thus, this film illustrates the fundamental value of the Golden Rule as a cure for racism: treat others as you would like to be treated. Even monsters love their children.",9,2,3,28 February 2011
"Girl, Interrupted"," Girls Trying to Tell Us Something
","This is my second viewing, having watched this film when it first came out. So...by now, the careers of Ryder, Jolie, Duvall, Moss, and the late Murphy have all processed through the Hollywood machine, and the only ones left standing are: Jolie, Duvall, and Moss. So this time when I watched this film, I saw something different in Ryder and Jolie. And what I saw was that they had been perfectly cast as themselves. Ryder looked overworked, underweight, and tired. Jolie appeared flippant about serious underlying rage, and slipped in and out of extreme emotions as she tore a path of destruction behind her with all those she vented onto.Somehow, this didn't seem to be a stretch for either of the actors because based on what I've read about Ryder, she was suffering from extreme fatigue and exhaustion; and Jolie spent several years in the tabloids proving how an angry teenager turns into a crazy young adult who likes to do shocking things for attention. Wow. And she received awards for this. Nonetheless, the cast was very good, and the general tone of the movie was captivating and realistic while maintaining its value as ENTERTAINMENT, for all those reviewers who believe art should imitate the true grit of life. No, please. That's why we like films. Because they give us something to look forward to next time; because they allow the viewer to escape for awhile. It's very difficult to put all the details of one person's descent into mental illness into a one-and-a-half-hour of time, as anyone knows who watched A Beautiful Mind. So good job to the screenwriter and the director. This film is cleverly written, acted, directed, and produced because it slowly, imperceptibly, and progressively makes the mental institution appear safer than the world outside; which is illustrated toward the end of the film when the kind nurse played by Whoopi Goldberg tells Ryder's character not to 'drop anchor' there. And while some reviewers have remarked that Ryder's character seemed self-indulgent, spoiled, and simply struggling with non-conformity, Ryder's character articulated the grim reality of her own mental illness when she painfully admitted to Jared Leto's character that she tried to kill herself by taking a bottle of aspirin; which was a complete departure from the character's denial when she was first admitted to the institution. When confronted with the opportunity to be free, Susanna was also confronted with a choice to be honest or stay stuck in denial. My favorite scene was the scene where Susanna and her parents were having a conference with the doctor played by Jeffrey Tambor, and Susanna's mother couldn't stop crying, while Susanna's father was loudly demanding to know how long his daughter would be in 'this place?' Then Susanna asked if her disease was genetic, and both parents halted their self-absorbed behaviors for 1 second to hear the answer before resuming their own brand of insanity. This scene told the viewer everything they needed to know about why Susanna felt depressed. Who would have anything to look forward to at 18 years of age when they had already realized how pretentious the adult world is? And what a kid has to become in order to 'fit in?' Oh yes, these girls were trying to tell us something, and here it is: children like to pretend, and as children grow up they're told by adults to stop pretending and face reality. So whose reality are they supposed to be facing, when they see that all the adults they should be able to trust are pretending? or plain lying? That realization could cause a girl (or a boy) to be interrupted in the transition from child to adult. Thus, the title and the ensuing madness.Jolie can emote, that's for certain. Ryder can look fragile without effort because she has the physicality for it. That said, she's a talented actress and I miss watching her. Murphy was awesome, bless her little soul. Would've liked to have seen more of Redgrave, but then, Redgrave is so much more interesting than the others, so her screen presence had to be limited. Goldberg played Goldberg. And that's not to diminish the energy that is called Whoopi. No matter the role, Whoopi Goldberg comes across as down to earth, honest, no pretext.A good film if you want to feel understood.",Null,1,1,12 February 2013
The Breakfast Club," Don't Forget About Me
","I was 31 years old when I saw The Breakfast Club and remember feeling ripped open and understood all at the same time. The film was so good in so many ways: the writing, the directing, the casting, the soundtrack all blended into the perfect recipe for a classic unforgettable portrayal of how savage high school can be. The acting was amazing when you consider the ages of the actors and how sensitively they portrayed their characters. And I cannot imagine a better theme song than the one chosen from Simple Minds for purposes of driving home a valid and many times overlooked part of a teenager's life: feeling invisible, unimportant, lost, and alone with the fear that they are the only person it is all happening to and that nobody would understand or care if they knew. It happened to all of us, regardless of whether we were the beauty queen, the geek, the jock, the nut, or the criminal...we dealt with parents, teachers, bullies, self-doubt, triumphs, joys, and first loves in the hallways and corridors of high school. If anyone denies that fact, they are lying to themselves. Thankfully, someone remembered all of it and made their memories into a classic film to let us all know we have not been forgotten. It is in this way that art imitates life, and changes us all. I hope nobody ever tries to re-make this perfect film.",10,1,1,19 October 2012
