The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Great Leader Katniss
",Since the First 2 Films I was amazed how Katniss grew and I really love the 3rd and how it's almost like the book and how Katniss is feeling. I been such a huge fan of the books and I extremely love them all. They have done such a great job with the films and I can't wait for part 2 to come out to see the conclusion of the Hunger Games Story. This Whole story is actually very true of what could happen in the world today and it has such a truth of a how young women like Katniss can be leaders and how strong they are. It shows that just one voice can make a huge impact in the world. This World needs more voices to stand out from the darkness and how your voice can be so powerful. The story itself is so much more than just the action because it's life. I believe that movies should have more of the story itself than just 'Action'. Welcome to life.,10,10,34,1 December 2014
