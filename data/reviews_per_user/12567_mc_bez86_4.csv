Scarface," very, very, underrated
","Scarface is probably one of the most underrated movies of all time. When I saw Pacino's face (as Tony Montana) I immediately realized that this was no ordinary film. I really liked his performance here, and the soundtrack was good. The plot was the best. And 'fuck' was really a mainstream word here. I think this film must be included in the top 250...and I must say it really matches Robert De Niro's TAXI DRIVER and all those crap that made it to the Top 250. I mean, this film deserves more than how it was rated. Pacino? He's the best. The story? Nice. The plot? Very Good. The blood, gore, bullets and even Pacino's saliva (which sputtered when he was saying 'fuck' to the henchmen of Sosa) were like real. And of course...the pot was amazing (I meant the drug).",10,0,1,13 December 2004
The Godfather: Part III," Very underrated
","The third installment of Mario Puzo's The Godfather...Now playing...(Spoiler included)I think this movie deserves to be in the Top 250 of the database primarily because of the acting talents of most of the characters here. To start off with, Al Pacino displays yet another staggering amount of acting, complete with his now famous 'owl-eyes'. He perfectly delivered his role of an aging Don Michael Corleone here. Chills went up my spine when he delivered my favorite line of the film: 'I command this Family. Right or wrong. It was not what I wanted--'Next comes Andy Garcia. A clap-deserving performance as Santino Corleone's son. Nice temper and nice acting...he really is convincing as a good nephew to Michael. Finally, bind together the talents of Diane Keaton and Talia Shire...good women actresses. Keaton really knows how to act, and Shire is the perfect sister for Pacino.The spoiler, I noticed, is Sofia Coppola. I must say her act is a bit lame and isn't right to be paired with such talents as Pacino. They could've chosen anybody else.Anyway, perfect sounds, perfect plot (next to Godfather 2) and perfect villains. 9 stars out of 10.",10,5,10,8 December 2004

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Emotional and fantastic
","The final installment for the pre-Luke Skywalker trilogy, this movie DOES NOT FALL OFF MY EXPECTATIONS. I even think this is the best of the series, because of its nice story and great effects.I particularly applaud the acting skills of Ewan McGregor, Hayden Christensen, Natalie Portman and Ian McDiarmid (who played Palpatine so well I could even hear him now) and I also like the way Samuel L. Jackson portrayed the angry Jedi who wanted to bring Palpatine to justice..oh well.The storyline is great, and especially the ending where the twins are brought to their new homes...I almost cried when Beru received Luke from Obi-Wan.The best Star Wars movie of all time, and the best sci-fi movie ever.",10,3,7,22 May 2005
