The Blair Witch Project," What a dissapointment...
","'SCARY AS HELL...' is a huge over-statement...This movie held up to the hype worse than EPISODE 1... It was alot like watching the Real World uncensored... I can see how the first viewers found it frightening, for they had no idea whether this film was real or an elaborate hoax, but in my viewing I had seen all the interviews, read all the reviews, and it became an often tedious movie-going experience plodding along from one argument to the next... I'm sorry, but when it comes to horror, some scary music and a little blood and a cat falling on a piano will still scare the hell out of me in a dark theater any day",Null,0,0,21 October 1999
Fight Club," AWESOME
","'How much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?' Possibly the greatest movie I've ever seen - amazing direction, cinematography, and digital effects... excellent script and great cast... everyone should see this movie!  This is definately worthy of Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Both Pitt and Norton), and Best Adapted Screenplay nominations when oscar time roles around...",10,0,1,21 October 1999
