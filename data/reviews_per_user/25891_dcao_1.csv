Vertigo," A detective follows a rich man's wife and ends up in more trouble than he suspected.
","As a young adult viewing this film for the first time, I found it full of suspense and very well-constructed. I was definitely not disappointed - this film exceeded my expectations by leaps and bounds. For once a film does in fact live up to the hype - the pacing of the movie is perfect and the storyline believable and everything gets explained. I identified with the character's struggles and felt quite compelled to feel the same feelings, and that is what defines a good movie to me. I find this to be a flawless masterpiece with unexpected twists here and there. Everything has a purpose too unlike some movies you see nowadays - Bravo!",10,2,4,9 August 2005
