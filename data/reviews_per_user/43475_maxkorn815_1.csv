Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," absolutely hilarious
","I saw this movie the other night at a special test screening. we were the first audience to ever see the film. it was a bit long, bu that was because it was completely uncut. But you must go see this film, it is absolutely one of the funniest movies i have ever seen 5 out of 5 stars. borat goes to America to make a documentary about American life that he can show to people in his home country. he does this to show his people how to better themselves from things found in America. he travels across the country meeting just about every type of person. some of it is acted and staged, but some seems to be real interviews with real people and it is absolutely hilarious. the theater i was in held 400 people and the laughter was so loud and long at times that we actually couldn't hear the movie and missed some dialogue. if you have ever enjoyed da ali g show, you have to see this film.",10,364,744,3 February 2006
