The New World," Typical Academy Tripe
","I give this a four because it was pretty to look at. Other than that, it was complete garbage. I almost hate to say that as I enjoyed the acting, the pacing, and the photography. In fact, I was really looking forward to this film.Upon watching it (the day it came out in theaters), I found it to be completely historically inaccurate. As a descendant of John Rolfe and Pocahontas, I have always hated the romance myth concerning John Smith. This simply never happened. In reality she was only about 11.The worst is that there is a truly beautiful love story between Rolfe and Pocahontas that was never really explored. I counted on Malick to have enough respect for his subject(s) to portray it truthfully, instead of making a hackneyed attempt at rewriting history. He let me down. If a filmmaker can't respect his subject, then I can't respect his work. I will never watch this film again.If you want the truth, read a book. Try starting with 'Love and Hate in Jamestown' by David A. Price, or 'The Jamestown Adventure: Accounts of the Virginia Colony, 1605-1614 (Real Voices, Real History)' by Ed Southern. Avoid this dreck like an Indian raid. Or a worthless hack.",1,25,44,17 June 2006
Marie Antoinette," Sophia Coppola murders cinema.
","Watching this, all I could think about was imagining Francis Ford Coppola handing his daughter a credit card and saying 'Honey, you can either go to the mall for new shoes, or make a movie. Your pick, sweetheart.' Fortunately for the audience, Sophia chose both, as evidenced by the fantastic shoes in this movie. The only thing missing is a plot, character development, decent dialogue, and any sense of pacing.This film more or less follows the typical structure of every Sophia Coppola movie:1. Throw away any structure whatsoever. 2. Show a girl sitting and thinking about stuff. 3. Cut to a fast, poppy montage. 4. Show the girl crying. 5. Show the girl giggling like an idiot. 6. Show the girl crying some more. 7. Cut to a slower, more 'lyrical' montage. 8. Show the girl looking kind of sad, but not too sad. 9. Cut to black with no resolution at all, which is okay since there's nothing to resolve.The 'stylized' and 'edgy' addition of a hip New Wave soundtrack did nothing but make the movie look like a Falco music video with a ridiculously inflated budget. And with a running time clocking in at an excruciating 123 minutes, Coppola manages to tell us nothing about Marie Antoinette. It's impossible to feel anything for anyone, simply because nobody ever does anything.I could go on for hours, but I'll sum it up as this: It's as if Coppola took the script from 'Clueless', took out all the jokes, and then tacked on that little revolution thing at the end so that, you know, a significant event would occur in the film.If you insist upon putting yourself through this, if even for morbid curiosity, then at least wait until it comes out on video. Or be prepared to tangle with the theater management for your money back.I hate this movie.",1,3,8,28 October 2006
Coffee and Cigarettes," Good, good stuff.
","This film was great. I'm a big Jarmusch fan and this was him at his best. Funny and fast paced, this flick keeps you engaged from beginning to end. It starts out a bit slow, and a couple of the vignettes fall a bit flat. Over all though it's witty, fun, and thoughtful. The best stories in the film would have to be, in no particular order: 'Cousins', 'Delirium', 'Cousins?' and the very last one with William Rice and Taylor Mead (I can't remember the name.) All these are in the latter part of the picture so if you start dropping off in the first half, 'Renee' (kinda funny, too much dead time) or 'No Problem', hold on. There's indisputable awesomeness around the bend.",Null,1,2,23 September 2004
Cold Mountain," Skip it.
","First of all, I'll come out and say that I'm a fan of the novel so of course I expected to be disappointed. I didn't, however, expect to be made physically angry. For whatever reason, Hollywood still hasn't seemed to figure out that NOT every good book has to be made into a film. In fact it rarely works, particularly with this Minghella dude at the helm. There was absolutely no chemistry between Law and Kidman, the accents were incredibly poor and ruined any semblance of authenticity, memorable dialogue was completely deleted for no apparent reason whatsoever, and... I could go on and on. In short, it had none of the heart, wit, beauty, and charm of the novel. It amounted to little more than another big budget 'epic' that might as well have been called 'Hey! Throw me an Oscar!' Still, I must admit the cinematography and score were top notch. Of course, if I want a collection of pretty pictures and music I'll put together a damn slide show and skip the rental fee. Or maybe I'll read a book.",Null,2,4,17 September 2004
