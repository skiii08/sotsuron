Casablanca," Great classic movie
",The cinematography in this movie is unparalleled. The dark lighting and heavy shadows create that classic film noir feeling that gives this movie the dramatic effect. One thing that I really liked is that there are a lot of close up and medium close ups that really focus the viewers attention on who is speaking and allow us to concentrate on the story. A very creative aspect to the movie is how we don't find out the story between Rick and Ilsa all at once. Flashbacks and the use of the character Sam allow us to slowly figure out the situation between the two. The dramatic twist at the end comes as an unexpected but valiant move and shows Rick to be the character that we didn't quite see him as throughout the rest of the movie.,9,0,1,10 May 2011
Citizen Kane," Great film
",I've seen Citizen Kane a few times now and it seems to get better every time. I always notice a few new things. The plot is very interesting and I find that the way it is told with flashbacks makes his life story easy to comprehend. It was cool to see how all of the different people throughout the story remembered him. Welles' use of lighting in Citizen Kane is unmatched by any movie I have seen. The lighting along with the use of creative and dramatic angles puts this movie in a category of it's own. I liked the story in the sense that Kane was able to go from a poor family to running a news paper it gives you the feeling that anything is possible. This movie is worth watching multiple times because each time you appreciate the cleverness of Welles' directing even more.,9,0,1,10 May 2011
The Grapes of Wrath," California travels
","This classic tale of a family's struggle to make it across country I found quite interesting. Growing up in a middle class suburban house hold this is quite different from anything that I have known. I like Steinbecks use of harsh angles and lighting to add to the feeling of depression and hopelessness that is portrayed by the characters at times throughout the movie. I can see why this movie would be controvercial back in the day, however today I couldn't help but think how reserved it was. Modern movies have way more to say about the government and most of the time they are not good things. I felt that this was a pretty good movie overall and from what I can guess is an accurate portrayal of what many families had to go through.",6,0,0,11 May 2011
Annie Hall," Woody Allen
","I didn't really enjoy this movie. I found Alvy quite annoying with his constant complaining and pessimistic views. At the end of the movie I felt somewhat depressed and at the same time relieved it was over. The story was one that has been used many times, the classic case of a nerdy guy falling for a woman that is seen to be out of his league. I did like how at times Alvy was narrating so that we could figure out what was going on inside his head, and I found that the asides or soliloquy were creative ways for Allen to throw a few jokes into the movie to make it a little more light hearted. Overall I did not enjoy the movie and felt that it was the following of a whiny man in an overused story line.",4,4,8,10 May 2011
The Graduate," Great story of a confused graduate
","This is a great film that takes advantage of the 'New Hollywood' era in which films were allowed to show things on screen that were previously deemed unacceptable by the Hayes Code. A few things that I found interesting were the use of popular music of the time, Simon and Garfunkel rather than an orchestra like previous movies. Also there were numerous scenes where Benjamin is in bed with a woman, engaging in sex before marriage which was unheard of prior to this era. Another thing is that this movie is wide screen in order to get people to go to the movie theaters because it isn't something they can see on TV. This was an interesting movie and I could relate because at this point in time I also have no idea what to do after college. This is still relevant today with a lot of people graduating and not so many jobs available.",10,1,1,10 May 2011
Singin' in the Rain," Interesting musical
","I'm not really the biggest fan of musicals but I did somewhat enjoy this one. The acting was quite good and the dancing was fa-nominal. I enjoyed how the musical told the story of the switch of the movie industry from silent films to 'talkies' and the troubles that came with it. The colors were amazing which made this movie very interesting to watch. The love story was complicated but not so much that it didn't make sense. The thing that I most enjoyed were the dance routines. I have never seen dancing like that before. Even the minor characters could dance, like the 'make em laugh' song. Even if you aren't a big fan of musicals, this is one that anyone can enjoy and it is obvious why it is a great American classic.",8,1,2,10 May 2011
Psycho," Horror
","I don't really like horror films but this one was OK. I found it very suspenseful which helped keep my attention. I liked the murder in the shower scene because it is a great example of an early movie right after the abolishment of the Hayes code. Never before were we able to see a showering woman murdered. This is one of the most influential and memorable scenes in not only horror films but American films in general. The beginning of the movie seemed very real and I think helped me get into the movie. The only thing is I don't get why she was trusted with that much money, I feel that is pretty unrealistic, however it is a movie so anything goes. Overall pretty good horror movie and it definitely paved the way for the modern day gory horrors we watch today.",6,0,1,11 May 2011
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Social commentary
",I liked this movie because I know that I can relate along with most other people. I loved Jack Nicholson's acting. I thought that he really played the character well and how the director imagined the part to be done. I think this movie brings up interesting points regarding Mental illness and what it actually is. Just because someone is mentally ill does that mean that they can't function in society and be locked up. I think that this movie did a good job on tackling some of the stereotypes and misconceptions about mental illness all the while taking us through an interesting story with great acting. This is one of the more interesting social commentary films that I have seen.,8,0,2,11 May 2011
