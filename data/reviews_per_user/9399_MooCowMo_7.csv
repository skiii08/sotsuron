Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not Bad But Shoulda' Been Better...
","We've all been waiting quite a while for George Lucas to come out with his highly-anticipated prequels for the Star Wars Trilogy.  And while this one fills the void somewhat, I would be lying to say that I wasn't disappointed. While the much-touted fx are quite extravagant, Lucas glops it on, like so much computer-generated katsup, covering up the gaping hole created by a thin story & even thinner characters.  As usual, everything in the Star Wars universe is shown in black and white: you are either good or evil, no shades in between, no complex characters or motivations that complicate real life, where on occasion good people perform evil deeds, etc.  No, that would take too much effort to show.  The bad characters are obviously, irredeemably bad, and are made-up to show it, while the good characters are flawlessly good.  While I liked the scenes showing the planets, but didn't care much for the people who inhabited them - the Naboo are obviously the 'white' people, and they are rather bland and vanilla; the leathery Gronks (sp?) are the 'dark' people, and are given a horrifying accent & exaggerated movements; the Trade Federation people seem only interested in money & have pretty obvious 'oriental' accents.  I'm not sure what Lucas is trying to say here, but it seems fairly sophmoric.  Let's get one thing fairly clear here: Ja'r Ja'r, or whatever the hell his name is, is a constant irritation & obvious plot device.  He's worse than that annoying little kid that ruined Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom.  And while we're at it, Anakin Skywalker is pretty irritating too, although that maybe partially blamed on a weak script and some pretty amateurish acting.  Liam Neeson & Ewan McGregor are both fine, especially McGregor, whom we hope has more to do and say in the next picture. Natalie Portman trys to overcome the shortcomings of the script, and that's good for something I guess.  The fight scenes with Darth Mol are very good; I wish moore had been shown - except what's up with the orange laser door thing??  Too many things happen for no explainable reason; these poorly masked plot devices which are used to push the moovie along manage to drain much of the energy of the film.  This is especially true of 'The Force', the supreme deus ex machina which allows the good characters to get away with practically anything, no matter how ludicrously far-fetched. This moovie also finally shows something even more useless than imperial stormtroopers: the Republic battle 'droids.  These pathetic metal fodder spend the entire moovie shooting their little laser guns, hitting nothing, and getting decimated by everything.  As a matter of fact, Naboo is invaded and involved in a war, but you'd never know because almost no one dies, there is no blood, and the only ones who get 'killed' are the poor battle 'droids - but it's ok because they are robots, and they don't count, so bring yer kiddies so we can sell moore toys.  Yes, this sounds a bit cynical, because this could have been a great, mammoth moovie, if only Lucas had put some time and effort into telling a good story with well-rounded characters, instead of loading up the eye-candy.  But if you liked Independence Day or Armageddon, ie 'see shiney things go boom', chances are you'll love this as well.  I think die-hard Star Wars fans will be disappointed at the lack of depth.",4,1,2,22 May 1999
The Mummy," Keep this mummy under wraps... :=8P
","Yet another entry in Hollywood's latest line of Big Budget Dumb Eye-Candy. The moovie is all fx, no acting, not story, no dialogue, nothing else. Worst of all, the fx range from impressive (ancient Egypt) to stupid (the mummy priests).  It's sort of like a Jerry Bruckheimer version of Army of Darkness, only with moore moolah, and no humor, action, interest, etc, etc. 'Oh but I just want to be entertained', says the brainless masses lining up to see this turkey - well I've got news from you, chummer, this moovie is long and tedious and boring, and has almost no entertainment value whatsoever.  Still, it was better than Armageddon, so do what you want with yer hard-earned weregeld.  MooCow says this mummy is moronic. :=8P",3,0,0,8 May 1999
Ed Wood," Udderly Mooovelous Accownt of Schlock Master!! :
","Thank god for Ed Wood - and thank god Tim Burton('Nightmare Before Christmas', 'Edward Scissorhands') broke all the Hollywood rules and got this wonderful picture made!  'Ed Wood' portrays Edward D. Wood Jr, that boy-wonder writer/director who was responsible for 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', 'Glen or Glenda', 'Orgy of the Dead', and a whole host of miserably awful, and unintentionally funny, horror moovies in the 50's & 60's. Director Tim Burton's film is a labor of love; he has cast the film to perfection, photographer it beautifully, and has resurrected flawlessly a unique period in film history.  Words cannot describe the near-perfect performances by everyone cast in this film, in particular Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi - he brings a bittersweet tragic quality to Bela's character that was well-worth his Academy Award(finally they picked the right one!). Johnny Depp is no less wonderful as the boyish, angora-craving Ed Wood himself, who idolizes Orson Wells, wears his girlfriend's sweaters, and naively believes he can make a blockbuster Hollywood film.  Depp, in fact, shows another side of Wood, as someone who cares about film, and someone who does not judge people because of their weaknesses, a rare thing in rapacious Hollywood.  Sure, all of Ed Wood's moovies are schlock (and I do mean ALL of them), but at least the first group of them are made with such feeling and innocence that you just have to love them; certainly, they are the fount from which devotion to Le Bad Cinema, and even MST3K, begins.  Burton has made far moore Hollywood/mainstream films ('Batman', 'Sleepy Hollow'), but it's a moovie like 'Ed Wood' that separates him from the typical hack Hollywood automaton.  This moovie would never had been made without Burton's creative genius and pull, so no matter what schlock he directs for The Man, we all should thank him for making this glorious, hilareous tribute to the King of Turkeys!  The MooCow says this is a must for all Ed Wood fans, and even those not afficionados of schlock cinema will enjoy this moovie as well.  Great soundtrack is worth getting.  The MooCow says get 'Ed Wood' now!! :",9,0,0,6 December 1999
Armageddon," You Know Ross Perot's Line about a 'Giant Sucking Sound'?? :=8P
","Well, Hollywood schlock-meister Jerry Bruckheimer has done it again with 'Armageddon', another over-blown, overly-idiotic pile of cow flops.  This time he would have us believe that only macho roughneck Bruce Willis & his cadre of simple-minded, slovenly oil riggers are all that stand between us and a loud, fx-ladden end of the world. What plot there is involves Willis & his goons REPLACING NASA ASTRONAUTS (who were all 'un-cool')to fly space shuttles to land on a meteor that's headed to earth, drill into it, and detonate a nuclear warhead.  Oh, and get home in time to save the soppy, needless romance between an obnoxious Ben Affleck('Mall Rats') & a pouty Liv Tyler(aging hair-rocker Steve Tyler's talentless daughter).  All of this is crammed together with moore unnecessary explosions, moore shameless flag-waving, and moore cheesy, embarassing Aerosmith tunes than I thought was humanly possibe.  This laughable, moronic plot is so wafer-thin it makes Kate Moss look like 350 lbs of buttered lard.  :=8P  All the characters are vague, non-dimentional cliches spouting incredulous, lousy dialogue: they are about as rich and alive as a rotting mollusk(which might explain the film's vivid scent...).  The only actor able to breathe any kind of life into their pitiful roles is Bruce Willis, whose performance ranges from smarmy, self-affecting smugness to over-the-top, unintentionally hilarious. No one else even registers, especially the vaccuous Tyler.  Of course, we're all really here for the eye-candy, right??  Who cares about rich characters, engaging dialogue, or a compelling plot, when Hollybore gives us Shiny Thing Go Boom?  Well, Bruckheimer gives us Shiny Thing Go Boom ad nauseum.  Many things in 'Armageddon' blow up for no udder reason that to squeeze in one moore explosion to up the 'Ooh-Ahh' quotient.  For example, there's one obvious, needless plot device involving a drunk Russian(ooh that's original) & a space platform which blows up just so we can see it blow up.  Aside from the overwhelming noise and amount of explosions, the fx were pretty poor - just exactly how does a multi-billion dollar piece of precision engineering, which is grounded when 1 tile falls off in reality, fly through a hail storm of meteor debris?  The MooCow has not seen such shameless, jingoistic flag-waving since 'Red Dawn', during the Evil Red Empire-Reagan days.  The film's message is blatant: America is #1, all other countries should bow down before us & pray that we save their worthless butts.  It's hard to believe that such an 'ugly American' film would go over well in udder countries.  The cheesy, vomit-inducing Aerosmith moosic is a constant irritant, and a lame attempt to curry favor with teens by connecting her with her famous father's hopelessly over-rated band. Overall, this cow hasn't seen such a high-priced, over-blown cow flop since 'Independence Day' or 'Men in Black', and this film is even worse.  The MooCow says don't waste yer time with this stink bomb. :=8P",1,4,7,5 January 2000
The Exorcist," Terrifying!! :=8.
","Simply put: The Exorcist is THE modern horror masterpiece, bar none. Don't believe the MooCow??  Just ask the millions of people who, moore than 25 years later, STILL refuse to watch it on tv or on video.  The Exorcist helped re-define the modern horror moovie from the psychological angle, and sports some of the moost famous, disturbing, and downright disgusting scenes ever put to film.  Ellen Burstyn stars as Chris McNeil, an actrees in DC who'se daughter, Ragen (Linda Blair, in her only good performance ever) just may be host to a demon named Legion - or is she just schitzophrenic??  Max Von Sydow, in a glorious performance, leads the team of priests, each with a past, to take on the demon.  There is a darkness to this film that few other films have ever even come close to capturing, and the intelligent, captivating screenplay is superbly handled by Director Friedkin & his cast. Friedkin previously directed The French Connection, but then all but vanished, except for a couple of little-seen, unknown moovies.  There are sooo many excellent scenes in this film, the MooCow has difficulty selecting just one, but perhaps the scene where Fr. Karras get the tape-recorded voices translated - mooocho creepy.  In fact, the MooCow is getting scared now thinking of the film...  :=8( Anycow, this is the perfect moovie to put on late at night, and snuggle up with your cuddlebunny to.  DVD version is even moore glorious.  Cud be the best horror film ever made.  MooCow says go get it now!! :",10,1,1,14 October 1999
Halloween," The Night MooCow Myers Came Home!! :
","Landmark, ground-breaking horror film from John Carpenter that created a whole new genre in horror: the Omnipotent Slasher flick.  Every film from the 'Friday the 13th' series, the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' series, up to and including the bland 'Screams' series, owes everything to this pioneering chiller.  Hitchcock's 'Psycho' may have opened the door for psychological horror films, but 'Halloween' blew the doors wide open.  A young murderer who grows up in an institution for the criminally insane escapes & makes his way back to his home town in time for Halloween, where he gives the frollicking, nubile teens what-for.  Michael Myers is a witches' brew of urban myth, homicidal psychosis, and obsessive, raging revenge, all in one monsterous metaphore unlike anything previous in Horror film history.  Some of Horror's finest scenes in come from this terrifying chiller.  The opening sequence, with the 'thru-the-mask' 1st-person view of little Michael's first killing, is a stroke of macabre genius, showing that under the right circumstances, there is a little Michael Myers in all of us.  The final scene is a chilling shock that jolted screams from every theater in the country - never before had a killer/monster walked away from his death scene.  We are appalled by the ambiguous ending because it confirms once and for all that we are dealing with something beyond our scope of understanding.  Michael Myers has become a universal fear come to life, the boogyman, a force of nature that mankind cannot even cowprehend, much less kill.  At least 'Psycho''s Norman Bates, for all his psychotic foibles, is human.  Somewhere, somehow, Michael Myers lost his humanity, and became the very living symbol of death.  How do you fight that?  You can't, and that's what 'Halloween' is all about.  Every aspect of this film is superior, from the direction to the acting to the legendary creepy film score.  'Halloween' casts a frightening shadow over every horror film made since 1978, and it's influences on modern film cannot easily be cownted.  This is essential viewing for all horror fans, and the MooCow says you better get yer hooves on a copy, before Michael Myers comes for a visit... ;=8)",8,0,0,14 November 1999
The Sixth Sense," A Scary Moovie! :
","Excellent ghostly horror film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, cleverly plotted and beautifully photographed, with moore than a few chills and twists.  A surprisingly superb performance by Bruce Willis('Pulp Fiction', 'The Last Boy Scout') as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, the child psychologist who tries desperately to cownnect with a reclusive, ostracized young boy, equally well-played by newcowmer Haley Joel Osmet.  I say surprisingly superb in regards to Willis, who for once shows a level of depth and refinement previously not allowed him by the cardboard characters of his bone-headed, fx-ladened action movies ('Armageddon', 'Die Hard').  'The Sixth Sense', like the earlier 'Blair Witch Project', has become an instant horror classic, thanks largely to the wonderfully written script of Shyalaman, a heretofore largely unknown talent from the outscirts of Philly. His story eschews gory, cliched action-horror, and goes for the intellectual side of the supernatural.  Well-done, genuinely frightening, and lots of fun, the MooCow says grab some popcorn & check out this ghastly goody!  :",8,0,0,11 November 1999
