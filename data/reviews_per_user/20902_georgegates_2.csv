Requiem for a Dream," a badassed masterpiece
","NO SPOILERS IN HERE...although quite understating and a bit too short (for what it is and deals with: namely of a really profound background: drug (ab)use and the complete wreckage of three persons lives). Furthermore the movie deals a tad with how society treats the affected ones, throughout either exploiting or disgusted.As far as the understating goes and supposed you have seen other bader drug movies you'll surely make up your own opinion, of what i'm speaking. The movie's name would have implied a storyline chasing the haunting lives of those junkies all the way long to their demises. (the girl will certainly commit suicide)At last let me mention the ingenious and perfectly fitting music (if ya in trace, techno music and you'll certainly just be stunned)",10,0,1,30 May 2003
Pi," this movie doesn't fit the IMDB scale anymore...
","as to me it deserves a clear 11 out of 10!! It is possibly amongst the 3 best movies of all time and approches as style and theme in which so many film have terribly failed.So far there are only two films available from this dircetor, Darren A., and both are amongst the best i've ever sine; well indeed they fill my top 3 list, with PI at the top and Requiem for a Dream right beneath it (actually i dunno which of those is better).When it comes to film music, it's certainly one of the most important parts, which deceides over the movie's success due to the influence of the viewers perception. Darren seems to be into Techno, Trance music, as this is the prevailing kind of music in his masterpieces, extremely well fitting, and because i'm totally hooked on that stuff it is one of the main reasons for my extemely high ratings.At last let me mention that this is certainly not for everyone, but one thing's for sure: THIS FILM IS NOT OVERRATED (as stanley's 2001 is) BUT RATHER UNDERRATED. It's an extremely profound film, and you might not understand everything in it, however i was relating to this artwork from the get go.The movie set's place in the erly 1990's (juged by the applied computer technology), and the story is put wonderfully into one sentence in IMDB's tagline.",9,1,3,31 May 2003
