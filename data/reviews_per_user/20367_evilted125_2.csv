The Incredible Hulk," Summary
","First off all let me just say well done to the creators of the marvel comic industry cause if it was not for them then we would not have these wonderful characters and the lines of films that they have been in.Second of all ED Norton wow he played such a good role as the hulk Like he was born to play it or something,third Liv Tyler she picked a good film to make her come back onto the big screen as she has been out for quite a while the reasons in which in don't know.Fourth From start to finish i was well entertained in the cinema Lots of action and a few funny bits also in the film and plus a good story,And the revealing of a new character in the film in which i wont rune it for people who hasn't seen it, And also a surprise guest appearance form someone at the end in which you will have to wait and see the film but for those who have seen it you know who i am talking about",10,3,5,19 June 2008
The Mist," My review
","Let me start of by saying the movie title was the real reason on why i watched this movie and the trailer was the second, Don't really know any of the actors in it except the for the mean guy who i think was from the punisher!!!, The Very first seen in the film were a man came running from no were and ran into the store shooting like mad thought it was a bit over done!!!, Was a little very disappointed about the rest of the movie cause you never really know were the story is going think they just made it up as they go!!!! So if you want to be entertained and and horrifed watching a movie thats meant to be a horror then this mite not be the horror for you!! but still worth a watch cause of stephen king!!",2,1,5,26 July 2008
