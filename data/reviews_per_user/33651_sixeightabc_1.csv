The New World," Boring -- Waste of DVD Rental
","I rented this movie because I read a lot of historical novels about ancient native Americans and thought this would be interesting and would give me a better feel for some of the time periods. Cinematically, it was LOVELY. Plotwise and acting-wise, however, I just about fell asleep. I think what bugged me most was that the main characters rarely, if EVER, spoke above a whisper. Much of it was a reflective inner monologue, but does the ENTIREMOVIE have to be that way? The actress playing Pocohantas never spoke a SINGLE WORD so much as she simply breathed them. Who DOES that (unless they have a severe disability)? Even Colin Farrell's character rarely spoke in anything approaching even a normal 'indoor voice'. Trust me, closed-captioning is ESSENTIAL to watching this movie. Except for some physical clashes (where MOST of the Indian characters were, at least, QUITE vocal) and an occasional distressed person at the settlement, the entire movie was passionless in every respect.",4,0,4,20 September 2006
