Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It was okay.
","I'm a huge Star Wars fan, but this movie wasn't exactly one of my favorites. The story was a bit hard to follow and the only real interesting part, at least for me, was the fact that we were just meeting Anakin for the first time in the saga. Jake Lloyd, the boy who played Anakin, wasn't the best person for the part. I think George Lucas could've picked a much better actor for his role. I think the best acting in this movie was Ewan and Liam (Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon). It's too bad that Qui-Gon eventually dies. And Ewan did a great job as Obi-Wan. He had to live up to Alec Guiness's work and I think he succeeded. (Alec Guiness played the old Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars-A New Hope) Overall, it was an OK movie.",7,1,2,24 July 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," LOVED it.
","Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones was much better than Star Wars: Episode I - Phantom Menace. It had more of a chick-flick vibe to it with Anakin (Hayden Christensen) and Padme (Natalie Portman) falling in love but it still had the whole Star Wars action in it. And I think it was great how Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) got to go on his own detective-type spree. And with the whole love thing between Anakin and Padme, Hayden Christensen's looks come in handy. I mean, let's be honest, he is pretty good looking. And Natalie is beautiful. At first, I didn't think the two had much 'chemistry' but as the movie progressed, I could see they did. I saw the movie about 3 or 4 times before I understood everything but overall it was a great movie.",10,1,2,24 July 2007
The Queen," A little bit disappointing...
","You know, I didn't really enjoy this movie as much as all the other people that have seen it. Princess Diana's death was really heartbreaking in real life and in the movie, but I just didn't find it that interesting in the movie. It was quite boring if you ask me. But Helen Mirren is a great actress, I have to admit it. And the movie didn't allow the boys (Diana's sons) to have even one line. My mom, who was born in England, found it very hard to watch it because Diana's story was so heartbreaking for her. I didn't find the movie to be all that interesting, really. But still, I wonder what the actual Queen would think if she saw this...",7,0,1,24 July 2007
