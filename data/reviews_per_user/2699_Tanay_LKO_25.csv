Moneyball," 'Baseball Blues - How To Play An Unfair Game'
","Moneyball.......that's what the idea of assembling a team of Baseball players based on statistics and analytical knowledge of the sport (known as 'sabermetrics') was termed by sports-journalists. The method was unorthodox and controversial as it challenged the analysis of the Baseball insiders (viz. the players, the scouts who are like the 'selector-consultants,' the managers) by talking of solid numerical terms, like - 'base point avg.', 'runs batted in', 'batting avg.', 'stolen bases', etc. something similar to Cricket's 'avg. score', 'run rate', etc. The idea, though vague enough to be discarded, had some very strong points in the matter of predicting a player's on-field performance and of the team as a whole. 'Runs win the game....' that's what was important for an under- performing team and that's what was in the mind of the Head GM of Oakland Athletics Baseball Team, Billy Beane. So, he began assembling a team, that too in under-budget, to get the Oakland A's the wins it was missing. However, that was not all the reason Billy had in his mind for this unconventional approach. In a scene, Billy is arguing with the then Head Scout of the team on his approach. He says, '.....You don't have a crystal ball. You can't look at a kid and predict his future any more than I can. I've sat at those kitchen tables with you and listened to you tell parents -'When I know, I know. And when it comes to your son, I know.' and you don't.'' The thought emerged from Billy's early day experiences as a player, when he was recruited by scouts, who talked about conventional approaches of efficiently hitting and throwing the ball and told his parents that he would be a good player, in a similar fashion as the dialogue goes above. So, Billy declined a university scholarship and with a high-school degree went on to play professional Baseball. But, alas, he performed badly in further matches for several seasons with different teams and thus, dropped away soon to become a scout himself; followed by the General Manager. Hence, Billy started assembling players based on pure analytical wisdom, along with his Asst.GM Peter Brand, an economist, who was good with the knowledge of statistics of Baseball. He esp. took undervalued players to fit the criteria of place on the field and needs of the team, more often on a player's capacity to 'steal bases', which are like taking runs in Cricket. Though, unfruitful initially, the team started to pick up by and by, with continuous cautious trading of players in the time. Billy personally motivated the players to concentrate in specific areas and also maneuvered his ways with the team's on-field manager, who was highly disgruntled with all the player selection. All this started to work out, little by little. Later, the Oakland A's became the first team to hold the American League Record of 20-consecutive wins. All done by an underdog team, full of underestimated players. Though, Billy wasn't able to win the last game of the championship of the year 2002, which was his sole modus operandi as that was the only thing that meant eventually according to him, still his efforts were appreciated in general in the Baseball world. In the aftermath, it was shown that Billy was offered a GM post in another major Baseball team, Boston Red Sox, with the highest pay till this time, of $12.5 million which he cordially declined to stay as the GM of his former team. He is still the GM and waiting to win the Championship match. Also, based on his ideas and analysis methods, the Red Sox won a championship in the years to come. The film in general, concentrated on the idea of managing a Baseball team or management in general with all the tactical ways of choosing and 'buying' players. This was definitely a new approach in film-making, as usually the films concentrate on the sport or game in specific and its 'spirit' and not much on managing. Also, the film didn't lose its sheen in 'managing' the overall drama, anxiety and emotion associated with the sport. In a few scenes, a metaphor is used 'How can you not be romantic about Baseball?' Brad Pitt (who played Billy Beane) and Jonah Hill (whose role was written as a complex character based on real men associated to the sport) played their parts excellently as the GM and Asst.GM of the Oakland A's. Not to forget, the director Benett Miller who did his job well in displaying such an excellently directed film. Also, the story writer Stab Chervin and the screenplay writers Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin and of course, Michael Lewis the author of the adapted book, were pretty good with the display of in-room discussions and all the sport management tactics. Overall, this was a clear cut excellently produced film and no wonder, that it got this year's Oscar nominations in 5 categories including Best Picture, for which Michael Di Luca, Rachael Horovitz and Brad Pitt himself are nominated. On a personal note, I would like to mention that I knew hardly a thing about Baseball as a sport. Still, this film managed me to stick through my seat for all the time I watched it and above all, helped me understand the sport. I didn't feel bored, not for a moment while watching it.",8,0,1,14 June 2013
Finding Neverland," Finding 'Neverland' - 'in search of a wonderful place'; a hideout, a heartbreak, a respite, and a motivation
","It was Albert Einstein who once said, 'Imagination is more important than knowledge; for knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and understand.'Finding 'Neverland' - 'in search of a wonderful place'; and the pursuit actually took me places. Freddie Highmore and Johnny Depp have outlived their characters to transpire the experience of such journeys to the minds of viewers.Over the years, 'objective' in literature, just like our lives, has grown so much that people have forgotten what fun and at times - 'education of wisdom' - is fantasizing. Based on the life of J.M. Barrie and on the events leading to his creation of Peter Pan, this film gently reminds us of the joy and the gifts of imagination.However, an essential question arose around its middle - 'Why imagine good things, and dream for better when in reality all we'll receive is disdain and disappointment from life?' The reason being - because life's hard, and indeed,'realism' is necessary and should transpire in our minds as we grow up; however, our hopes shall not fade away because in the end, what matters is that how honestly we trusted ourselves to make it less hard and more pleasant with our loved ones, with our work, and most essentially with 'ourselves'. Maybe that's what was tried to be emulated around the film's climax.Marc Forster (Director; 'Stranger Than Fiction', 'Quantum of Solace') quite meticulously made this film into an 'imaginarium' of sorts, where imagination was the motivation to hope and to be resilient. The screen writing by David Magee(Screenplay, 'Life of Pi') was nothing less than 'enchanting', and so was the film's editing by Matt Chesse, a frequent collaborator of Forster. The casting of the film was another plus; Kate Winslet playing the ailing mother was quite moving.Surprisingly, in its crux the film talks of 'growing up' while speaking of 'the undying spirit of youth'... Maybe that's what maturing is and more so - growing wiser. To quote from another popular film... 'If its not good, its not the end'... And I would like to 'hope' so.",8,0,0,16 November 2014
Last Flag Flying," Friendship over Grief under the 'Last Flag Flying'
","The 'Before...' trilogy and 'Boyhood' have been a few films for which film-maker Richard Linklater was in recent news. The trilogy happens to be one of the most celebrated romantic-dramas in the last few decades, whereas, the other, a remarkable 12-year long coming-of-age drama about the metamorphic journey of growing from a boy into a man.Then arrives 'Last Flag Flying', a multi-character narrative on the death of a loved one. Surprisingly, its all about life and living.It's December 2003. A widower, Vietnam War-Veteran, 'Doc' (Steve Carell, 'The Office'), is on his way to collect the casket of his son, killed-in-action in Iraq. Before the scheduled burial with state-honours, Doc has a plan of his own to cope up with the events - to visit 'not' his best friends, but former 'brothers-in-arms'.Enter - 'Sal' (Bryan Cranston, 'Breaking Bad'), a carefree, reckless owner of a small-bar and with no hoots for humanity; and then 'Mueller' (Launrence Fishburne, 'The Matrix'), now a grandfather and a God preaching-reverend. Poles apart, but they stick along with Doc.'Men make the wars and wars make the men' - resonate their minds as they argue over differing school-of-thoughts and realising their mutual guilt over their past. Hence, beginning from an obligatory stand-point their camaraderie grows up to believing '...that even old men should become threats.' So, our 'boys' not just share their sadness but also laughs at boy-funny jokes and eventually, just bond like old homies.I've grown up reading Ruskin Bond and Mark Twain on 'bromance'. However, apparently it's not too melodramatic to experience friendship in its truest colours. It lies within talking about stupid versions of their philosophies, laughing your lungs out while travelling in an uncomfortable train, or by getting suspected as terrorists, or just buying mobile phones for the first time - the cheap-thrills, the idiosyncrasies are the 'fizz' and the 'buzz'.But, those old veterans had their best years behind them with nothing more to gain and carried pain in their hearts over their old and new experiences, esp. Doc who lost his son and wife. 'Pain is Pain', said Sal; though, in just being together reminiscing past frolics and failures must have brought them some catharsis. Maybe in emptiness, that does look like a sound start to pick-up our lives.Righteously, as the end-titles role comes a bitter-sweet song 'Not Dark Yet' by Bob Dylan.'I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from
Don't even hear the murmur of a prayer
It's not dark yet, but it's gettin' there.'There's still some hope, even in the worst of our ends.One remarkable control of Linklater is that his films may stay within the boundaries of crossing-over to pathos but, he puts forth the living in the most relatable of circumstances. That all may seem too articulated esp. around this scenario which may turn overwhelming for viewers. So at two-hours long drama and slow sequences it could be a drag. Nevertheless, I'd watch this film any given day again for Carrell, Cranston and Fishburne reminding how friends are - 'not the best, but still ours.'That African proverb makes more sense now - 'If you want to walk fast, walk alone. If you want to go far, walk with a friend.'A lukewarm, yet pleasing - 7.5/10",8,2,4,12 January 2019
Spotlight," SPOTLIGHT - on Scandals and Journalism
","'Sometimes its easy to forget that we spend most of our time stumbling around the dark. Suddenly a light gets turned on and there's a fair share of blame to go around.' --Screenwriters Josh Singer and Tom McCarthy have done some 'very good reporting' of true incidents back in 2002 of what could be defined as - 'widespread and systemic child sex abuse in the Boston area by numerous Roman Catholic priests' and its media-coverage by the oldest continuously operating newspaper investigative unit of the United States - The Boston Globe's SPOTLIGHT.The biographical-drama lived by its tagline - 'break the story, break the silence' – while it builds up 'captivatingly' from banal looking journalistic lifestyle to focus the aftermath of a short- column story, leading to the events of factual-investigations over a period of a 2 years into several full-fledged news articles that subsequently ran about 600 follow-ups, publicly-accusing a quarter of a thousand priests and brothers for pedophilic activities against a thousand known survivors in Boston itself, thereafter leading to the public apology of the archdiocese and the resignation of its Bishop, leading to widespread appraisal of this work – including a Pulitzer Prize. However, the unfurling-tension of the truth and the shocking facts about the hush-hush negligence by law and the church especially, make a rueful impact and at the same time, are equally urging for the long-delayed justice's deliverance. Not losing pace once, surprisingly, with bundles of information flowing around and distinctively develops around its characters, and from the journalistic POV; though, not boring for a second. Needless to say the direction, editing, casting are all done right and more than well, but what is outstanding is its score (Howard Shore, 'The Lord of the Rings trilogy') - the theme of somber, careful unfolding to a widespread impact.The film is 'highly-recommended' for its simplest of depictions, defining why the press is called the 'fourth pillar of democracy' and the very reason of its necessity in a modern day society and the citizens to not just think but to live responsibly as well.Rating - 8/10; Verdict - Worthy of remembering, and its 6 Oscar nominations",8,1,2,21 February 2016
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag," A shining tribute to The Flying Sikh
","'BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG' is biopic inspired by the life of Indian Olympian Athlete and Padma Shri Milkha Singh is a tremendous work and does more than justice as a tribute and commemoration of his shining athletics career. As a young boy, I read about THE FLYING SIKH and heard several tales of his wins from elders. Thus, the sports-drama serves as a visual treat to all who know of him and as an essentially major history lesson who don't. The USPs of the film are the portrayal of the athlete by Farhan Akhtar who gave an enviable and 'flying' performance inspiring awe followed by the exemplary direction by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, cinematography (Binod Pradhan) and production design. The film traverses through the life tale of Milkha Singh who came in as young orphaned refugee into India to live with his sister, shuffling through small time robbery and finally joining the Indian Army as a Jawaan where he polished his skill of sprinting and finally achieved international acclaim including breaking a world record. The film reaches its highest point when he races in a sports meet held in his birth country Pakistan, where he not only wins gloriously but also makes peace with his turbulent past and is given his famous title by the then Pakistani President. It gives goose- bumps by its culmination, such was the beauty of this scene. Screenwriter Prasoon Joshi outdid himself in adapting the auto-biography of the athlete and breaking it down in altering timeline to give a more vivid description of the events. The music (Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy) does well. Divya Dutta was picture perfect as the elder sister along with Pavan Malhotra as the army coach and Sonam Kapoor had a decent guest appearance as the love interest. Rather, the ensemble cast was quite a hightlight (Art Malik, Yograj Singh, Rebeca Breeds, Japtej Singh, Meesha Shafi). To summarise, this may be one of those films that may inspire masses to think differently about a lot of things and may even be celebrated over time. Definitely, not a film to skip.",9,1,1,5 August 2013
Interstellar," INTERSTELLAR - Beautiful and 'Believable, even when its not'
","'We've always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments these moments when we dared to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the 'unknown' known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements. But we lost all that or perhaps we've just forgotten that we are still 'pioneers'. And we've barely begun And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, because our 'destiny' lies above us.'INTERSTELLAR travel – a journey of exploration of spaces 'situated in stars'. However, the literal meaning falls short of summarizing the happening of an entire film that is been deemed as 'paradigm shifting cinematic phenomenon' worldwide by viewers, critics and (most of the) scientists alike. Toying with the idea of 'we didn't inhabit Earth to stay, but to leave it someday' – this science-fiction drama tried to browse through the possibility that 'end of Earth, shall not be the end of mankind' for which a team of space-explorers travel from the degrading Earth through a 'wormhole to find a potentially habitable planet that could sustain humanity', with the help of futuristic artificial intelligence based robots and neo-designed space-ships.Lauded by many and criticized by several for crossing the logics and reasoning too many times, this film reminds us of an inherent ability. To re-quote Gerry Spence, 'I would rather have a mind opened by wonder than one closed by belief.' The choice shall be rested on individual judgments. There is no surprise that this film would have been eventually made by Nolan himself, looking at his history of films like - 'Following', 'Memento', and 'Inception'. It won't be an exaggeration to call him a 'wizard'. As with every Christopher Nolan film, the 'possibilities' are explored and tested in a fashion as if it is not a piece of art, rather a medium of simulation to verify and validate those possibilities, and still a viewer leaves the theater with doubts on conclusion and ends up with a more personalized understanding of the entirety. Even an engineering graduate like me felt his brain in 'over-drive' post-viewing this two and-a-half-hour long film, where a problem of future human survival was ably defined, described and possibly solved through the Astrophysical hypotheses and theories. Jonathan Nolan proves to be a very resourceful screenwriter to have etched out such a plot and story out of theories based on and suggested by works of Theoretical Physicist, Kip Thorne, who also served as an Executive Producer to the film.The most brilliant works done on the film – VFX (supervised by Paul Franklin; 'The Dark Knight Trilogy') to go par 'make believe' and actually 'make us believe' in the possibilities of something that might happen (or might just happen) in distant future; Music, by Hans Zimmer, depicting ominous grandeur and solitude that not only enhanced the vastness of the portrayed outer-space but also, touched the viewer to the core becoming the part of their 'memories'; Sound Design (supervised by Academy Award winner Richard King) and Editing (Lee Smith; 'The Dark Knight') were an integral part of backbone of the film; and so was its engaging Cinematography (Hyote van Hoytema; 'Her').Amongst the cast, Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathway are indeed brilliant (especially the former) and gently remind their previous Oscar wins. Jessica Chastain, Mckenzie Foy, Michale Caine – play their supporting parts most emphatically. Guest appearances by Casey Affleck and Matt Damon were quite surprising yet, done well.To conclude, the film even with its jargon-heavy second-half doesn't pull down the spirits, and could even be enjoyed for a second time especially by our 'astronomy aficionados'. This film, being helmed as a milestones after works like – '2001: A Space Odyssey', 'Avatar', 'Life of Pi', 'Gravity', etc. – is in the most simple words – 'believable; even when it's not'. A 9-rating for its pioneering brilliance and the sheer beauty of the Nolan-style of storytelling.",9,0,6,21 November 2014
Nightcrawler," NIGHTCRAWLER - The Crime-Thriller Behind-the-News, with Gyllenhaal's gripping performance
","An urban, pulp-fiction theme of a messed-up, yet enthusiastic account of the world of freelance crime journalism of-sorts, venturing into the night to get catchy and juicy pieces of salable crimes to news channels with the highest bids.Things start turning up twisted when a once petty-thief (played outstandingly by Jake Gyllenhaal), in his over-ambition and surprisingly impressive marketing skills to make it big at anything starts to, by-and-by not just film crimes in- action and but, construct the pieces in a more dramatically-suitable manner. While walking the fine line of creating more fiction than news, he almost successfully turns the game in his favour by playing a diminutive intern, and an experienced news director by sheer connivance. Nothing can surely stop him because he beats competition - fair or unfair - whatever it takes to be ahead in his game.Writer-Director Dan Gilroy makes it a little disgusting, at times with the heartlessness involved in the complete lack of empathizing, sympathizing spirit of the protagonist (or the antagonist). This film speaks about the human nature's selfishness taking one to the limits of what one is truly capable of doing, or not doing; for inhumane is not just the action, but initiating and supporting the same.",7,0,1,5 July 2015
Bridge of Spies," Little-Big Men - Mark Rylance and Tom Hanks on the 'Bridge Of Spies'
","'We little men, we just do our jobs.' #BridgeOfSpies #Short_ReviewSomething innocuous, yet so distinct that it can't be ignored. Rather its valued; perhaps, one of the important outcomes of watching this drama-caper.Based on the negotiations for American-Soviet spy exchange of 'Powers for Abel', and the craftsmanship of American insurance lawyer, James Donovan.Only when one started to think that it would be a regular, even a little banal-looking account of some Cold War events, it came out to be not just different but a lot better than imagined. Surprisingly comical, this politically paced drama-thriller keeps one hooked for more than usual reasons - which has now become a typical attribute of a Steven Spielberg film, and doesn't stop surprising.Tom Hanks, with his effortless portrayal of Donovan, and the 'staggeringly sharp' Mark Rylance as the Russian Spy Rudolf Abel - remarkably contribute in the film's subtle nod to the spirit of resilience and men of courage. As aptly stated in a Russian phrase for 'Standing Man' - of virtue, of missions, of patriotism and of the families.Watchable, enjoyable, and likable! Clear 8/10",8,1,1,6 February 2016
Dangal," 'DANGAL - Making of the Medalists in 'Wrestling of a Lifetime'
","In a rural town of North India, what would possibly be the concern of a father of 'four' young girls? Many would say earning sufficient sustenance and arranging dowry to get them married. Gratefully one such father was pondering over a different set of anxiety all together – 'how to make world champions of his children'. 'Dangal' (Wrestling Arena) is a sports-biographical drama based on the lives of Indian Wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat and his two daughters – Geeta and Babita, transpiring the events to their glory in Commonwealth Games 2010.Opening up in the dusty arena of the mud-slapping 'desi-pehalwaans' (wrestlers) with the pulsating title-track, where Mahavir Singh (Aamir Khan) himself prepared his way to become the national champion in Freestyle Wrestling. Due to financial constraints he gave up his sport to earn bread-and-butter; although, he refused to give up on his dream to win an international Gold for India. He wished to raise his son to such stature; little did he know that he would only be blessed with daughters, thus, a bane for his dream. Until he discovered that even they possess the stamina and the spark of a wrestler. Thus, with a new found belief he began the training of the young 'Phogat Sisters' (Zaira Wasim and Suhani Bhatnagar), marked with much resistance and hindrance from the wee kids, their mother and the society, in general. The endurance of severe nerve-wracking months began under their father's coaching as Geeta and Babita scaled fields, heaved through push-ups, beaten down in sparring by their frailish cousin brother and cried their eyes out as they begged to not chop off their hair – all to no avail. Till, one day they realized how fortunate they have been to be raised unlike other girls who are married off at an early age or merely shoved into the 'chuhlah-chaukah' (kitchen) of their homes; motivating enough to make them into better wrestlers, upto the mark that they jostled their way to national championships and international team selections. Even as the adult - Geeta and Babita (Fatima Sana Shaikh, 'Chachi 420'; and Sanya Malhotra) had miles to cover. The journey ahead for them was marked with egotism, training disarray and self-doubts, ' wrestlers aren't made overnight. They have to be tended and cared for a lifetime.' Indeed, the bout had only begun. What's remarkable is that even on covering a plethora of topics bordered by societal norms of male-favouritism, disfavor to sports and discriminating girls, it doesn't lose a beat and neither time. It's almost surprising to see such level of fine and crisp editing (Ballu Saluja, 'Lagaan') which not just puts the perspective, but even the narrative right. The cinematography (Sethu Sriram, 'OMG – Oh My God') is a plus, along with the most blending of scores (Pritam, 'Barfi!') produced in recent times. Aamir Khan is, as well-known, a natural performer and could be easily moulded out of his star-persona. He possesses a master control and gumption in his style, which is almost too simplistic, yet brilliant.However, the real 'hero' is the National Award recipient Writer- Director, Nitesh Tiwari ('Chillar Party', 'Bhootnath Returns') who has not only drawn career-best performances from the likes of Aamir Khan and stars, but at the same time portrayed a universal-story of human endeavor, spirit and triumph without losing the vision of wrestling, as it is. Even with some creative liberties, such was the environment within the theatre that my co-viewers were jumping and cheering from their seats for the recreated matches. I found myself joining in and stood fervently, when the National Anthem was played for that Gold for India.Dangal is undoubtedly a rare and sparkling gem of Indian and World Cinema, alike. If not already, please do watch at the earliest. A revered 9/10.",9,6,11,24 December 2016
Apocalypse Now," Insanely Heavy Reenactment of Dystopian War; Sheen Shining
","A cinematic reenactment of perpetuating the dystopian war; and 'insanely heavy' is the first term that comes to my mind. Like a narcotic, the film floats through rugged memories and improbable realities about a rouge General (Marlon Brando). Whereas, a Captain (Martin Sheen) sent to assassinate him with 'extreme prejudices', struggles with his own and his men.As I complete this 3.5 hour long film, I am a bit amazed by the art of creating such a prolonged, unrecognisable narrative of a war. At the same time, the imagery of gory Vietnam War is difficult to digest and so is watching the ferocious men, living the shell-shock amongst the war atrocities and the farce of making it. Nevertheless, anyone who is a junkie for war-genre and/or a fan of the likes of Brando and Coppola, won't be able to hold back watching it.Cringeworthy viewing experience.

Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation - 'Once Again into the Frey...'
","The Mission Impossible film-series has got an interesting self-benchmarking style of delivering similar-like, partially predictable but highly engrossing, edge-of-seat action- thrillers.The trend continues with the fifth installment of 'Rogue Nation' – a virtually-existing terrorist congregation of mysteriously disappeared or disavowed secret-agents from all-over (called the 'Syndicate') to bring down the powers of the free-world by executing highly- organized and well-timed acts of terror. At the same time, the 'Impossible Mission Force (IMF)' is dissolved on grounds of indiscipline and unruliness by the CIA, unknown to the fact that the Syndicate is carefully conspiring to the organization all along. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team (Jeremy Renner, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson) strive to get matters under control in their most challenging assignment till day, and seem unstoppable and undefeatable in their endeavour; but so are the enemies. It does become scary and really 'impossible' this time. The MI franchise have a comparatively distinguished take on espionage when compared with the James Bond franchise – a lot less sensuality-oriented and through-and-through spying format; though, it is also a lot lighter than the Jason Bourne franchise with a toned down rustic element, and at par action-sequences. Editing has always been a prime element with a fast-paced thriller and so is Sound Mixing. Fortunately, they're spot-on delivered by – Eddie Hamilton ('Kingsman: The Secret Service', 'X-Men: First Class') and Chris Munro (Academy Award winner for 'Gravity'), respectively. Cinematography (Robert Elswit; Academy Award winner for 'There Will Be Blood') was diverse in shot-selections combining opulence and a rhythmic pace, and have made it fairly-bigger than the previous installment of MI. Direction and Co-Screen writing by Christopher McQuarrie (Academy Award winner for screen- writing 'The Usual Suspects') are mostly theme- based and carry a bit of a comical touch on intervals, making it a little more enjoyable amongst all the action and stunts, which were greatly enhanced by the Special-Effects (Jason McCameron; 'Gladiator', 'Inception'). A few depicted stunts were already talk-of-the-town since pre-release, especially the opening sequence where Hunt is seen clinging to the door of an Airbus Atlas – been shot without any use of CGI (a faint reminder of his Burj Khalifa feat from 'Ghost Protocol', though with VFx). The film is abundant with such gasping thrill-sequences and perhaps, seems to be a little too much to handle by mid-way; though, an action-aficionado won't complain and rather, have appetite for more.'Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation' is indeed an appreciable attempt to deliver fresh-adrenalin into an era old film series, and Tom Cruise's portrayal as one of 'history's most recognized screen-spies' is inspiring even for the fifth time. Watch it to feel that well-known, yet dormant thrill of an action flick (especially of a 'MI').",8,1,4,13 August 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," The Grand Life and its Times... A Melancholic Comedy-Drama in Wes Anderson's Signature
","The Grand Budapest Hotel﻿... is one the best films that I have seen this year, so far. Wes Anderson﻿ has delectably concocted an adventurous, mystery with the touch of melancholy in its unfurling; quite reminiscent of the signature style of yet another of my favourite author, Mr. Ruskin Bond﻿.Based on the writings of Stefan Zweig﻿, the plot line is given a modern-day folk lore kind of prestige where its passed from 2 different aged people subsequently who surprisingly, but convincingly manage to preserve the authenticity and truthfulness in its journey that talks about - faithfulness, love, determination, passion, poetry, friendship, murder, fiendishness and hope. Still - all could not be won by men, and this case was no different. A lot was achieved, but in further course somethings precious were lost; as if the history of mankind was speaking of its own course.Ralph Fiennes﻿ and Tony Revolori﻿ - are the 'Jai and Veeru' of this story(only viewers of Hindi Films would relate to this one), though in very different times and ways. Brilliant bromance! The supporting cast, though brief, was adequately impactful.However, the film did try packing it too much in too short a span; which may seem sort of a waste to some at its culmination however, further adds to the feeling of loss and sombre nostalgia of yesteryear and the current times, as well. Undoubtedly, a film to be seen and cherished! Verdict - 'One of the best one-and-a-half-hours spent' Viewer's Rating - 8.5/10 Critique's Rating - 8/10",8,1,3,7 October 2014
The Artist," The Artist: The Solemn Silence
","I don't recall being just simply happy and content by watching a film. Simple, ethnic and surprisingly adorable. I remember, some time back when 'The Artist' was about to be released, I passed across the film's first look in a black and white poster, resembling the one of 'Gone With The Wind'. The old-fashioned look and the actors with French names, not quite recognizable by the English audience were what I noticed at that time. Well, I didn't pay much attention to this topic, till the time the film was released and became quite successful, both with the viewers and with the critics abroad. Curious as always in the matter of films, I Googled the film. Read a bit about it on Wikipedia that it was a silent, black and white film with semi-biographical theme of silent films, during the early '20s and '30s of the last century. Followed by this, I watched the trailer on YouTube. To be honest, I was surprisingly interested in the theme of the film. I did not know why, but I was. Since that day, which was a few months ago, I was desperately waiting to watch this film. Now, when I am done watching it, I could conclude that I wasn't at all bored, even for just a second, while watching this old themed film and moreover, feel nice about the whole thing. As aforementioned, 'simply happy and content'. The film tells the story of George Valentin, a major star of the silent films who introduces Peppy Miller, an aspiring actress and a fan, as a dancer. As the transition of silent films to talkies comes, Valentin loses his act and Miller being a newbie, gradually climbs the ladder of stardom. Though, in the process she never forgets Valentin and her love for him. Because of them, she even saves him from his suicide attempt and convinces him to make a comeback in the films by doing a musical with her, as they're both good dancers. The film concludes on a happy note with Al Zimmer, the producer - director of silent and then talkies, asking the duo to give another shot of a dancing sequence, to which Valentin happily replies, 'With pleasure!!' And indeed, it was a pleasure to watch all of them. Jean Dujardin being the protagonist of the film was outstanding in the portrayal of 'George Valentin'. Berenice Bejo was adorable as 'Peppy Miller'. The supporting cast of John Goodman as 'Al Zimmer', James Cromwell as 'Clifton', the valet of the protagonist and not to forget, 'Uggy' the faithful pet-dog and co-actor in all of the protagonist's films were delightful. Not to forget the writer-director-editor, Michel Hazanavicius and the producer Thomas Langmann for their approach and in making their efforts come alive, the D.O.P, Guillaume Schiffman and the music producer, Ludovic Bource and co-editor, Anne-Sophie Bion. The film however, tells a universal story on a wider perspective. The silent films made by the directors of yester years who went on to pioneer the art of film making, did something in pantomime that even talkies couldn't equal (without any disrespect). It might sound archaic now, but even today if one will watch a silent film, the sheer spirit of the people involved in it can't be neglected by a viewer apart from the obvious liveliness and mystical joy of the content.",8,2,4,18 June 2013
La La Land," 'La La Land' – A Visually Stunning Musical with an Emotionally Engulfing Afterglow
","Perhaps, a little late to talk about the 'The Most Popular/Admired/Loved/Binged Film' of the year and award season alike. Nevertheless, it proves that no matter how much the time passes people shall come, watch, admire and easily fall in love with La La Land.I found myself at an incomprehensible state of joy in the first-half of this musical romantic-comedy-drama, with simmering excitement amidst pompous song and dance as we entered the 'City of Angels' with 'Another Day of Sun' – where each morning brought prospects, and nothing seemed impossible; just like LA's weather of bright sunlight all seasons-round. Through those seasons, happens the chance meeting of 'Mia' (Emma Stone.), a barista aspiring to be a screen-star, and 'Sebastian' (Ryan Gosling), a dedicated Jazz- pianist with the dream of opening a club. As their paths entwine with apparent initial dislike in 'A Lovely Night', but behind vivid chemistry they eventually fall for each other – and there is no surprise at that with them being 'the Modern-Day Classic On-Screen Couple'. Their life and struggles ahead cause instant humour and at the same time rouse deep insecurity towards career and life, for there is price on every wish. While we go through heart wrenching trauma from failures and letdowns, we surprisingly feel them as if they're our own; for we've known it's not mere pleasure, but victory to have attained happiness.Thus, we rejoice in what Sebastian stated – 'This is the dream - its conflict and compromise, (and) its very, very exciting!' – which also happens to be the very emotion the film's most-beautiful sequence - a climactic surreal montage rife with studio-dance, art, colour, sight and sound of outright living the fantasy. By the time end-credits roll in we may find ourselves tearing up with a rekindled bittersweet- love for life and dreams.With remarkably transforming a simple plot into a romantic- Cinemascopic-homage to Hollywood's golden-classics without an iota of cliché, writer-director Damien Chazelle has outdid his feat of the intense 'Whiplash' and it won't be a surprise that he'd be called 'the youngest auteur of our times'. Justin Hurwitz's musical- score is touted to be the finest in the last few decades and carries a subtle-tenderness – be it 'City of Stars', 'Someone in the Crowd' or 'The Fools who Dream' - in those heartwarming and peppy tracks through the sharply put-together Tom-Cross's editing. Not to forget Stone and Gosling, who are artistically gifted performers and make the whole journey so melancholically beautiful and yet, playful.Winner of a record-breaking 7 Golden Globes, it won't be a surprise that we hear rewarding news from The Academy, as well. To the ones who haven't seen it till now, 'What are You Waiting for?'; and to the ones who have (including me), hustle for another preview.A applaudably-glad '9' to the almost-perfect feature made in a long while!",9,1,6,23 January 2017
Sicario," Dystopian reality of Mexican drug cartels - SICARIO
","SICARIO - the retchingly gruesome modern-day dystopia of the fight for order-equilibrium of drug cartels of Mexico, and the helplessness of law.Emily Blunt had never been more broken in character, playing a FBI agent unable to come to terms with the reality of the underbelly of the world as we know it. Benecio del Toro came out more of gentlemanly-intimidating as a 'free'-agent ('hitman') and near effortlessly 'absorbed absolute attention', and hands down - performed the best in the cast. Outstanding!Not at all recommended for light viewers - even with its fine cinematography, haunting score, and stunningly directed action scenes!!",7,0,0,22 January 2016
Joker," JOKER - Anatomy of Psycho-Dramatic Rise of 'Phoenix'
","A lanky Caucasian man, sitting in front of a make-up table painting his face white. Through his pondering eyes rolls a tear, smudging his mascara, while he pulls his mouth wide as if forcing a smile. Meet Arthur Fleck, a 30-something impoverished party-clown who's still mentally recuperating after years in the asylum.With a neurological disorder of uncontrollable laughter citing his traumatic childhood, Fleck struggles every day to make ends meet with futile attempts to tackle bullying in public and taking care of a delusional mother at home. Set in the 80's Gotham, where a worker's strike lead to city-wide garbage congestion and thus, rise in the anti-establishment views at large. Both of the above circumstances foreshadow the inevitable.
And then, a cataclysmic event by a desperate act of self-defence pushes our helpless clown over the edge. We see Fleck in makeup breaking into a slow-ballet and sashay to his music, wrapped in a calming trance of his own inner turmoil. We know it then, for sure, that our villain has arrived.Having said so, JOKER doesn't overcook the rhymes and reasons but is a textbook on the anatomy of a psychopath. It is well-structured, moderately paced with a compelling character-origin story. Director Todd Phillips and cinematographer Lawrence Sher ('The Hangover', 'War Dogs') create an enigma of sorts amidst tight close-ups over the ominous grave themes in cello by upcoming composer Hildur GuÃ°nadÃ³ttir ('Chernobyl') - all in a harmony. They make Fleck's circumstantial actions seem so justified that it's hard not to feel for him - even when he does things because he can.Been spoken about those influential comparisons with prior inspirations, such as - 'The Man Who Laughs' (a 1928 Victor Hugo novel's adaptation), or 'King of Comedy' (Martin Scorsese's 1983 dark-comedy, also starring De Niro, who plays a pivotal role here); the one with Jack Nicholson (1989) or, the most remembered 'THE Heath Ledger's portrayal' (Christopher Nolan's 2008 'The Dark Knight') - all seem justified. However, just like the latter did for 'Batman', this film does for the psychotic super-villain - viz. 'to make it incredibly more human'.And, who else could have done it better than Joaquin Phoenix? Much like some previous performances - 'Walk the Line', 'Her' - his portrayal is rhythmically alarming, comical, self-driven and empathetic that it wouldn't be an exaggeration to call it among the finest screen-acting in the last few decades. Embodying Arthur Fleck and his personality's grim deterioration are imploring enough to search for something personal in those exhausting cackles, painful failures and delusions of grandeur, humiliations, the agony of being overlooked and stepped-over. Hence, it feels triumphant when the retaliation comes through a cacophony of riots as the Joker rises with a wide smile, unforced and natural this time.So, until we have reservations with the portrayal of mental illness and violence on-screen, please don't miss this rare gem of a psychological-drama. We may have the last laugh with this one.Hypnotic and near brilliant!

Whiplash," Intense, Surreal, Sublime!
","Never thought that a casual browsing through a film, could turn out to be much more - storming, nerve- shattering, reminiscing horrors of the past, lift above them, and then becoming someone stronger than imaginable.'Music was never so violent and war-like before'; and in the film, once the performances began the depiction was so hypnotic and fiercely staged with the apparently plain story-line of an aspiring drummer under the training of a bipolar-of-sorts aggressive conductor, that events turn out to be supernova-like - a blast, annihilation, whirlpool of debris, forming, convolution and then evolution. Nothing less than 'rise of a phoenix from its ashes'!One of the most intense and emotionally-charging films that I've come across in recent times. Outstanding!!! Miles Teller​ is gradually coming in the zone of my favourite actors, and J. K. Simmons​ has given a formidably distinct signature-role in his name now, and that too with panache. An easy 8.5/10. Watch it, to believe it!",9,1,4,13 February 2015
It Chapter Two," Fair Scare, short of a few 'pennies wiser'
","This review is delayed, yet it seems befitting to talk about the sequel, cinematic adaptation of one of the most revered horror stories in modern English literature.Part two, or say the continuation of the prior story, is 'not' all about the terrifying clown. Set about 27 years after the horrifying clown-spirit Pennywise was sent to hiding by 7 lanky teenagers (a.k.a. 'Losers'), the haunting resurfaces to the town of Derry - recharged and more sinister. Bounded by their blood oath, those teenagers - now adults, reluctantly return to their hometown for the end game. Though, it shall take more than their presence for those losers to be united. As they became what they were running away from, together recollect an unsettling, fearful past to nab the 'fear' of the present.Scary, graphic and jump-scare thrills make most of 'IT: Chapter 2'. Much like its first-part, Director Andy Muschietti ('IT', 'Mama') and horror screenwriter Gary Dauberman carefully excerpt and modernize the even darker novel by Stephen King (who makes a rare cameo subtly criticizing his own story-endings). The allegory of facing fears as children to fight until death is remarkably executed. Given the master casting choices (with prowess and literal lookalikes to teenage actors) which include - Jessica Chastain (the girl-with-issues Beverly), James McAvoy (the stuttering Bill), Jay Ryan (the fat-boy Ben), Isaiah Mustafa (the black orphan Mike), Bill Hader and James Ransome (the latter two being brilliant as foul-mouthed Richie and hypochondriac Eddie) along with Bill 'The Pennywise' Skarsgard, make worth spending nearly 3 hours in a theatre.However, good an effort, this film feels deliberate. The terror-tainted background score (Benjamin Wallfisch, 'Blade Runner 2049') is well-crafted with conventional operatic overtures and unsettling string accompaniments, yet there's too much of it. Then, just like King puts it, the film falters in concluding its characterization properly, making it look like a rush job of ending on heartfelt introspection. Though, it doesn't nose dive from its own previous benchmark of horror and would get your heart-pounding and even, laughing-out-loud on more instants.So, there's no reason to leave this follow-up act out of your watch list for it doesn't (again, thankfully) do a 'Hangover 3'. Yet, for a few 'pennies wiser', it would have been exceptional to match 'IT' itself.",7,0,0,29 September 2019
Defiance," Freedom begins with the Act of 'Defiance'
","Year 1941; World War-II at its height. The Nazis invaded Belarus and swept entire towns of Jews - liquidating and deporting many to concentration camps. 'Freedom' was reduced to shreds; yet to reattain, it all began with the act of Defiance Recently orphaned in the carnage, the four Beilski brothers took refuge in the forests; only to know that hundreds like them, were scattered all over. The eldest two - Tuvia and Zus - soon realised that a more concrete settlement would be needed, citing the increasing numbers of their exiles. Makeshift huts came up first, followed by those sneaky 'food missions'. Thus, those stranded ones grew into an armed brigade ('otriad'). A 'communally-functioning-camp', individuals worked for the survival of all while living with the strict rationing in food, medicines, clothes, and even reproduction. Their lives constantly at threat of being caught or killed-in-action, didn't stop the Beilski Otriad to join the resistant Soviet Red Army against the Third Reich.When Jews were considered best at surrendering and dying, that frail clique resisted by living. Moses didn't, but they themselves hand- in-hand parted their waters, with 'courage as their ultimate weapon'.Good casting choices of Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber and the ensemble, to enact a lesser known sequence of events in this biographical-war-drama by Edward Zwick ('Blood Diamonds'), amidst his signature action-choreography and Oscar nominated civil-scoring by James Newton Howard ('The Hunger Games') makes it a fair watch for anyone interested in a different side of history.

Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Delusions, Allusions, Glory and a brilliant Story - contemporary American movie 'BIRDMAN'
","Birdman delves into the 'coming-of-age' of-sorts about risks, failures of life and truly accepting them while continuing to move ahead.An engrossingly-comic experience; 'Allusions' and 'illusions' both being central, this film is yet another master example of good production with sufficiently abundant bites of entertainment - both slapstick, and smart. 'A contemporary American movie with all tit- bits and some more = Birdman'The cast comprising mainly of Michael Keaton​ resurrects - in reel and in real with his semi-paranoid performance; Edward Norton reminds of his 'Primal Fear' time, only less insane and more of a prick; Emma Stone​ is unconvincingly good and a surprise along with Zach Galafanakis​ who gave a fairly 'out-of-their-stereotype' supporting performances. A special mention of the screen writing team, for developing a 'par- normal' story. I wasn't at all bored, even while watching it for a 2nd time.Alejandro González Iñárritu​ is applaudable with his multi-character narrative-style and so is cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, whose efforts have made this drama-comedy to look like 'one continuous shot'. One might not pay too much attention, but the film gives the feel of a non-stop plot, stretched over a few days. However, what makes it engrossing is viewer's genuine curiosity towards this story; just like the title, it all comes as a surprise - 'The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance'.As one wise man said - 'A man must know when to give up on things he cannot achieve'; the film not only touches this instance subtly, but makes it one of its most sparkling moments. 'Finding glory and achievement, through failures'. A happy '8/10'.",8,1,4,22 May 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Epic Impression, Falling-Short!
","As profoundly been discussed thus far, the film did include some good plot-points, storyline and signature punch-lines; however, the narrative on the whole wasn't fascinating. It just felt like overwhelming VFX punctuating a multi-character action. Apart from the brief Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Batman and Superman (Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill) barely sustained intrigue. Lex Luther is cast well (Jesse Eisenberg) who felt more of a counterpart of the Nolan's 'Joker'; though he went a little overboard. Overall, they're likable but, not quite where they could be 'absorbed-to-the-core' Super-Heroes.Although, the pre-intro fillers and the post-climax scenes paving way for 'Justice League' ensured something to look forward towards; and I guess that Zack Snyder could make the game a lot better.",6,0,0,3 April 2017
Green Book," Green Book - about a Journey of miles and 'Friendship'
","The Academy Award winning film doesn't do anything extraordinary; only, it takes the usual, ordinary stuff and does it extra beautiful.Despite the catchy synopsis of a black music-virtuoso being driven by a white Italian bouncer, the film in its core is all about 'friendship'.It depicts the real-life story of Dr. Donald Sherley, a celebrated pianist of Afro-American descent who is on a tour to the south of USA back in '60s when aggressive reservations about Black people were still prevalent. As he hires an Italian driver-bouncer named Tony 'Lip' Vallelonga, little did they know that its shall bring their internal-struggles forth - minimally depicted by the selection of hotels in a certain 'Green Book', where only Black people are allowed to stay in order to avoid 'aggravation' from the Whites, along with the discriminatory alienation of ones existence by creed, colour, ethnicity.However, that all arrives with an intermittent tenderness - of human bonding over wording out letters to one's wife, eating chicken-wings in a moving car no matter how unsanitary it seems, appreciating inherent talents of playing music or just playing with people, laughing-out loud, and then driving those long distances only in each other's company talking about what-not, and then appreciating how human it is to just be so.I, for once, was left smiling at the thought of just ending up with family and friends around as I had the time of my life enjoying two people covering miles while scaling distances within their heart; not to mention in ours as well.
Safe to say that it's a mark of a good film to make you feel so. So, watch to believe it or just be happy to have read about it, here.",8,1,2,10 April 2019
Spectre," SPECTRE - 'Resurrected' and Rising, in time
","The 24th installment of the James Bond film-series turns out to be an elaborately detailed film with suavely presented drama and dialogues, and the occasional yet consistent ting of action; just like Bond's martini – 'not shaken, but stirred'. However, 'all that glitters isn't gold' in this film.In the aftermath of being resurrected in 'Skyfall', Agent-007 James Bond (Daniel Craig) finds a secret-message from the now deceased M (Judi Dench) asking him to hunt down a man who happened to be the member of an anti-nationalist organization which had been covertly active since a long time working to bring down the world-order in a series of destructive events. Coincidentally in its uncovering, Bond stumbles upon the knowledge of every tragedy of his life being linked to this organization's leader – Blofeld (Christoph Waltz), the arch-nemesis.In his pursuit, Bond visits another nemesis, a retired assassin, Mr. White who directs Bond to his own daughter, Dr. Swann (Léa Seydoux). To protect this newfound link, and also to gain important knowledge, Bond chases down through Europe with the help of Q (Ben Wishaw) and Moneypenny (Naomi Harris) despite being stood-down by the new M (Ralph Fiennes), due to the bureaucratic pressures with the new merger of MI6 into a Centre of Nationa Security, headed by Denbigh (Andrew Scott, 'SHERLOCK'). Despite progress, Bond is on his own with the '00- Program' being shut-down and the Blofeld's henchmen narrowing him down in the rat and cat chase. The film then traverses through the back-and- forth between and more to deadly-conclusions, till the time all are in the open facing the heat.As a film, it gives a high dose of paraphernalia - the opening 'barrel-shot' with the firing James Bond; a brilliantly graphic main-titles (by the series regular, Daniel Kleinman) alongside Bond's signature-themed original song 'Writing on the Wall' by Sam Smith; the grand visuals (Hoyte Van Hoytema, 'Interstellar'); extreme and opulent-level of thrills and stunts; a flamboyant cast (including – Monica Belluci, Dave Bautista) with Waltz, Scott and Fiennes shining-out, and an abundant score (Thomas Newman, 'Skyfall'). To top it all, we have the Skyfall director – Sam Mendes ('American Beauty') – reprising his role to deliver us another larger-than-life Bond- flick. All very impressive and good; however all is very workmanlike and surprisingly lacks a certain 'bond-ing', and becomes a little too predictable at several instants with the plot line and giveaways. Thus, despite the thrills and splendor, the film falls short of being 'extraordinary'.'Spectre' is no 'Skyfall', sadly; still it is a fresh take on the life of Bond – professionally and personally. And that would hold a good deal of interest. Bond may be 'a kite flying in a hurricane', yet it's a pretty good-looking and strong kite, and we all like the way it flies.Rating – 7.5/10",7,0,4,23 November 2015
Her," 'Her' - Love Lost and Found
","Spike Jonze​ has truly, and not just according to the popular notion, delivered something that is nothing short of his masterpiece in this science fiction-romance-drama. The film revolves around Theodore ( Joaquin Phoenix ), a loner- divorced man in his thirties with a writing job, who develops a relationship with his female-personified operating system, Samantha ( Scarlett Johansson ) and together they explore their friendship, intimacy and eventually a consciousness of life, in general. The hyper-philosophy seems more relevant in visuals than in writing; (thus, undoubtedly - 'a picture could say a thousand words.') 'Her' resembles faintly a science-fiction fantasy, 'Vanilla Sky', in its plot line, however, with much deeper conclusions and of course, one might find themselves choking at certain junctures down the film.The film's unfurling resembles a book where Jonze is surprisingly quite just and accurate in depicting poignance along with the allusive framing by Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography ( Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Interstellar Movie ), that it actually engaging to know more scene-after-scene. Arcade Fire is symmetrical in its techno-acoustic music compositions, that garnish the narrative aptly.The film would be more suitable for people who are into honest, sincere romance/dramas and might just be too odd and rather stupid for the ones who prefer other genres (including - science fiction).Rating - 8/10",8,0,1,18 April 2015
The Martian," The Martian - predictably thrilling experience of inter-planetary travel!
","'Everyday I go outside and look at the horizons; just because I can.'<ul><li>The Martian​ Screenplay by Drew Goddard, Based on the novel by Andy Weir</li></ul>Thrilling, heartwarming, narcissistically funny - a 'Cast Away' like survival tale set in the 'magnificent desolation' of planet Mars. Ridley Scott has finally created something at par with his 'Gladiator'.Outstandingly done cinematography (Dariusz Wolski, 'The Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise), background score (Harry Gregson-Williams, 'Shrek' franchise) and visual effects (Richard Stammers, 'Prometheus').Matt Damon goes beyond excellent with his funky humour, although his character's subsequently drained out spirit somehow shines in his look, making him seem beaten-down yet mighty looking, capable of more than usual... something that resonates with his signature role as 'Jason Bourne'.Irrespective of the comparisons done with previous films of the space-travel based genre, the film-aficionados would still find it worth a treat to watch.8.5/10",8,2,4,9 January 2016
