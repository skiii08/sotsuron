The King's Speech," The power of acting
","The performances from everyone in this film were excellent, down to the extras and uncredited actors playing 'the common man' with such poignancy at a time when Britain faced its darkest hour of the 20th century. It's also about the acting that the new King had to learn, just to become the monarch at that stage in history, when the 'wireless' was the means of communication and the king was forced to speak into a microphone without being able to see any of his audience, or more terrifyingly, a huge crowd hanging on his every word. He had to lead his people and inspire them, and I believe that he did so in real life as well. Public speaking can be an ordeal, even for those of us who are not cursed with a speech impediment. Imagine the hell it became for a man with a dreadful stammer who had hoped to avoid being king and who had been taunted as a child because of it, who was suddenly thrust into this role by his selfish, feckless older brother. It's such a great story and the fact that it is true makes it more powerful still. It has charm and humour, I laughed and cried all the way through. The rehearsal scene in the Abbey just before the coronation was like a stage rehearsal or an audition for the RSC - so unexpected.I don't think the film is over-rated and all deserve the awards they have won. I would also like to mention the music. The original score was lovely, but the use of Beethoven was masterful, especially the 7th symphony at a climactic moment. Even though it was German music, it was absolutely right and very moving.",9,0,2,20 February 2011
United 93," Terrifying, real, moving.
","I have just seen this film for the first time, many years after the events that we all remember so clearly. It was shocking, although I knew what to expect. seeing the events of 9/11 unfolding from the perspective of the ground personnel trying to make sense of it all, the sense of urgency and apparently their inability to prevent the hijacked planes reaching their targets. The main focus of the film was on the events on the fourth hijacked plane which crashed in Pennsylvania. No one knows exactly what happened on that plane, but there is enough information available to construct a totally credible sequence of events.it's one of the most tense things I have ever watched and I was aware of my own fear responses kicking in. The performances of everyone involved are impeccable and completely realistic. Paul Greengrass made documentaries before this film and this shows in the filming and the non-sensationalist approach. The dialogue lacks any dramatic stirring speeches or anything we would expect from a conventional action movie. It's all about how ordinary people would react in a terrifying situation where initially they don't know what is happening, and then the reality dawns on them and they attempt to do whatever they can to survive.I was fascinated by the detail of what happened in Air Traffic Control from the first suspicion that something was wrong, to the events that we saw on the news. I assume that these events were recorded and everything really happened. It takes time for people to understand something so awful and so incomprehensible, even those who are highly competent and very experienced. I remember how I felt, listening to the radio and looking at the news coverage in the UK. I was bewildered, but it was a long way from me. For these people it was their responsibility to deal with an unknown threat situation.The power of this film is in its matter-of-fact approach which doesn't make judgements and presents the facts as they are known, in a very dramatic way. I am glad that I was brave enough to finally see it. Well done to everyone involved.",9,0,0,13 September 2015
In Bruges," Beautifully filmed
","I'm a fan and I don't mind the violence, which is an essential part of a film about hit men. The characters are violent men but we see that they all have a softer side. The darkness at the heart of even a beautiful place like the touristy city of Bruges is evident, and although the city is shown in all its beauty, I'm ready to believe that there is indeed a seedier side - there always is in any place of beauty.Colin Farrell's performance is excellent, as is Brendan Gleeson and of course Ralph Fiennes. The supporting cast are also very good, and the balance of humour and tragedy is satisfying. I also think the ending is great, unexpected and appropriate.I have been to Bruges several times and it is exactly like that, except hopefully without the violence. I recommend this film to anyone with an open mind who appreciates lovely architecture, dark humour and doesn't mind very strong language.",8,2,5,2 October 2011
Gravity," Gripping
","The suspense got me because I honestly didn't know what would happen. It didn't occur to me that the only 2 people in the film were Sandra Bullock and George Clooney - it didn't need any more. The outcome was not predetermined and I felt that anything could happen, even at the end. The CGI was obviously very impressive. Having now seen the International Space Station on TV from the perspective of British astronaut Tim Peake, I think I probably got more out of this than if I had seen it beforehand. I knew that if an astronaut is floating in space, they have to grab one of the handles on the outside of the space craft and preferably tether themselves to it. I wasn't surprised to see Russian writing in the Soyuz and that Sandra Bullock's character was not fazed by that - she was trained. I feel that the response of a highly professional scientist to a dire emergency in space was realistic. Even though she was facing death, she remained relatively calm (most of the time). Recently, I have had cancer and faced death myself. The calmness shown in this film is genuine, and believe it or not it is possible to be accepting. I am getting better, by the way.In summary, I found this movie very exciting, gripping and believable - almost. The disaster may not be realistic, but the human response to it was convincing. I applaud the achievement.",8,3,5,13 January 2017
Match Point," London looks great
","As a Londoner, I was very pleased to see what Woody Allen did with my city - he made it look as good as he has made New York look in numerous previous movies. Small corners of Holland Park which not many people know, as well as the fabulous new buildings in the City, all made it look like a good place to be. The film was unexpected and thoroughly absorbing, and when events took a dark turn, I was gripped. It was impossible to predict the outcome and the unexpectedness of it made this very different from a typical predictable drama about relationships. I was impressed by Woody Allen's ability to produce such a different type of film and although it wasn't what I expected, I enjoyed it. Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Scarlett Johansson were excellent - I believed that they were going through those emotions. The main thing that convinced me that this was a Woody Allen movie was the dialogue - his ability to make characters say things that real people might say, but also in a different way - more revealing than most scripts and clever with words. Definitely worth seeing.",9,0,0,7 October 2006
Closer," Disturbing and pessimistic
","I found this movie difficult to watch because of its content. It was based on a play and even though I didn't know that before I saw it, I realised immediately because of the quality of the dialogue and the lack of reality in the situations. As in some plays, I felt that the author was experimenting with human relationships, to see how extreme he could make them. At the start, I felt I could understand what was happening in the relationships, but as the movie progressed, some of the things that happened were so implausible that I found it hard to remain interested. Having studied relationships in real life, I wasn't shocked by the language or what the characters did, I just found it unbelievable.It works as a study in how people can behave and interact, but not as a reflection of a reality that I have experienced. There was no sense of real love or genuine caring there, the partner switching happened too quickly, none of the characters won my sympathy and in the end, I didn't care what happened to them. The best thing I can say about it is that at the end, I felt really glad to be me, because my life is so much better than theirs (whatever I might feel about it the rest of the time). However, the performances were great, especially Natalie Portman and Clive Owen.",7,1,1,12 September 2005
Gone Baby Gone," What a moral dilemma
","This was an unexpectedly great movie and I didn't know what was going to happen, but when it reached its conclusion I was left wondering about the moral dilemma that Patrick (Casey Affleck) faced. I felt that I agreed with him and he did the right thing, yet it was an impossible decision to make. If a child is missing, the detectives who agree to take on the case feel honour-bound to continue to search until they find the child. It seems like a simple matter, but this film reveals how complicated it can be. Along the way, we meet a collection of low-life characters who make the viewer feel depressed about the society we live in (or at least in that city) and wonder how any child can grow up safe. It could have the effect of disillusionment with the story, but the attitude of the two young private detectives is a beacon of hope: they know the difference between right and wrong. Even though their responses to the final dilemma are different, they illuminate the central minefield faced by anyone who gets involved in child welfare. Since this is one of the most emotive issues faced by our society, it's a compelling narrative.The performances were excellent and I wondered at several points how the collection of ill-assorted characters was made so realistic. The dialogue was hard to follow in some places because the realism of the delivery was such that I would have needed subtitles, but that didn't detract from the overall experience. The violence was convincing, but not overwhelming. Definitely worth seeing.",8,0,2,28 May 2009
The Aviator," Too long and not enough excitement
","There were some fine performances in this movie, and it reminded me of Citizen Kane in its approach to the life of a ruthless businessman, but I wasn't gripped by it and Hughes' character was so unsympathetic that I couldn't engage with him. Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Hepburn was excellent and I loved her (being a true Hepburn fan, I wasn't offended). I understood the technical excellence of the cinematography, but I need to feel involved in a story and Hughes behaviour was repellent enough to distance me completely. DiCaprio was good, but I couldn't see him as an older man later on in the story - possibly he lacked the weight required to show middle age convincingly. I lost interest well before the end, I'm afraid.",6,3,4,3 January 2006
Tropic Thunder," In the spirit of satire, it works well
","This movie needs to be understood in the spirit in which it was meant. I don't like action movies or crude humour, but I enjoyed the whole because I understood where it was coming from. The initial 'trailers' were hilarious and that gave me strong clue as to what to expect. As with The Player and Gosford Park (both by Altman) the main aim is to make a point that won't be spotted if taken at face value. This film works on a different level than a straight comedy because most of it is parody, and therefore the 'offensive' jokes are intended to be taken in that spirit. I'm a big Robert Downey Jr fan and he was excellent in this - his true ability shone through, playing a method actor who is playing a black man playing a soldier. How many people could handle that? Jack Black's task was a bit more thankless but he made a good job of the character that he played. The cameos were great - this is another reminder of The Player (another Hollywood satire) which is full of cameos.I found the plot interesting in its own right and if you enter into the premise of what might happen if a bunch of actors were actually dumped in a jungle for real, it takes on another dimension, ie. you can also take it seriously as an adventure. I was quite gripped by the story because I wasn't sure what would happen in the end (one major character died early on). Try to suspend disbelief and not be offended, and you might enjoy it.",7,3,6,26 March 2009
Mamma Mia!," Great fun
","I loved this movie because it had a fun atmosphere and didn't take itself too seriously. I love ABBA songs and the beauty of this music is that anyone who can sing can make the songs their own - their success is owed to that fact. The cast all sing and with varying success, but the acting was great and that helped to carry off the voices that weren't particularly designed for singing in public. I wasn't offended by Pierce Brosnan's performance, although he's no great singer. He was in tune and the spirit of the movie was that it was musical theatre. The story was light but sort of made sense, and the advantage of a musical is that the story can be silly and still be OK. Overall, it was an uplifting experience and I enjoyed it a lot. I have also remembered another film musical which had a similar feel, but a different atmosphere - Everyone Says I love You by Woody Allen. In that wonderful movie, all the cast sang their songs with varying degrees of musical ability, and it worked. I like this approach, and I'd be happy to see more of it in the future.",8,2,4,1 March 2009
The Grand Budapest Hotel," As good as expected.
","I saved watching this until I needed to be diverted from the winter weather. Fantastic, just as good as I anticipated it would be. The surrealistic atmosphere, the humour, the stellar cast, the Wes Anderson trademark quirkiness and darkness of the story, all made this memorable. I don't understand why some people who know that they are not fans of Wes Anderson's work have commented that they hated this film. His style is unique and if people don't get it or like it, the best approach would be to avoid it. Wes Anderson's contribution to cinema is legendary and he is one of my firm favourites. It's difficult to choose a specific aspect of this film which stands out, because it is uniformly excellent, and although Ralph Fiennes performance is central, all the performances however small (Bill Murray was a cameo and so were some others) were crucial and contributed to the whole. I have travelled in Eastern Europe and East Germany and some of the locations reminded me fondly of my travels. I have even stayed in ex-communist hotels and the Grand Budapest reminded me of these places. Amazing.",8,2,4,10 January 2015
School of Rock," Heartwarming entertainment
","No one should ever underestimate a child. The life-affirming feeling I got from watching this film came from seeing the kids in the film play the music and being real kids. Jack Black's character, while being a fake teacher, actually turned himself into the sort of teacher who makes a real impression on his pupils - the sort who inspires them to do great things. The unlikely events of the plot were easy to believe because of the enthusiasm of all involved, it wasn't at all cheesy and the music was great. The British TV show Rock School, where a real ex-rocker went into a real school and made a rock band out of some pupils, must have been based on this film concept, and that was exciting too. This film reminded me of what I liked about the show, but The School of Rock is better, in terms of excitement and sheer entertainment value. The kids involved were very young, but as we all know, kids can do anything and if you are talented, you are never too young to be musical.",8,0,1,4 December 2006
Back to the Future Part III," Great fun, in spite of the contradictions.
","I like the trilogy and in my opinion, they are all necessary and fit together. This is an enjoyable movie and can be taken as a unit, although there is some need to refer back to the previous episodes, in order to understand the beginning and make proper sense of the ending. It's a nice conclusion to the trilogy, because it ties up the loose ends and resolves some of the plot that was left hanging in Part 2.However, I have a problem that I can't resolve and I may be just misunderstanding something, but I don't get why Doc is missing at the end. At the start of Part 3, we know that Doc has gone back to 1885 by mistake - we found this out at the end of Part 2, when Marty receives a letter. Marty is now in 1955 (also by mistake) and he wants to get back to his original time, i.e. 1985. At the same time, he needs to return to 1885 to rescue Doc who is in danger of being shot. The 1955 version of Doc helps him to do this and this version of Doc remains in 1955. Marty goes back in time, finds Doc, eventually solves all the problems and returns to 1985. Then he says that he misses the Doc, who remained in 1885, but what has happened to Doc from 1955 who should have just got older? I know there are plot holes in all the films, but this has really baffled me.Apart from this issue, it's a fun film and I don't think it is a massive disappointment. It is Part 3 and it deserves its place in the series.",7,0,0,17 March 2013
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Food for thought
","One reviewer has asked whether this would have been less tragic if we had only been aware of the deaths of the prisoners in the camp. Movies have a trick of making you try to anticipate what is going to happen, and putting your own wishes into that conclusion. I realised after the end of this film that the tragedy lies in thinking that anyone's life is worth more than anyone else's life. In other words, who is more precious and whose death is more tragic? Surely in that situation, the final scene was terrible, no matter who was involved. The challenge of this film is to see the holocaust from a different perspective and try to see it through a child's eyes. The film has a matter-of-fact approach, but that helped me to see events through the child's eyes and imagine how what happened would appear if you were a boy who doesn't know what is going on, who has a spirit of adventure and a open mind. If you could be like that, what would you think about war? Does it make any sense at all? Being able to challenge the dogma that is being forced upon you is the spirit of freedom.I hope that some people seeing this excellent film will come away with some innocence restored and some faith in the power of friendship and love to overcome violence.",8,2,3,30 August 2011
Life Is Beautiful," Triumph of the human spirit.
","I take on board the criticisms of this movie by those who think it trivialises the Holocaust, but I think it is necessary to interpret it in different terms entirely. The reality of the Nazi death camps is not portrayed here; it would be impossible to do so in a comedy. Instead, we are given a sketchy idea of what life was like in that terrible situation and the movie focuses on the efforts of one man to survive and protect his son from the horror. It is a very light-hearted Italian view but maybe it makes a contribution as an alternative to more serious heart-rending accounts of the Nazi atrocities. Of course disbelief must be suspended if we are to be convinced that an intelligent child could avoid the reality of his situation, but I felt that the boy was playing along with his father, even though he somehow knew what danger he was in. I found myself wondering what the goal of the film was, and it wasn't to trivialise the most intense human suffering but offer an alternative response to it, and show a different type of courage. We can go through life weeping over the suffering in the world, which is all around us and hard to escape, or we can choose to concentrate on the good in other people and use that as a power to change things. Optimism is not necessarily self-delusion, sometimes it is the only thing between us and insanity.",Null,1,3,19 May 2004
Groundhog Day," One of the very best
","I watch this film every year, on 2nd February if I remember, in homage to the concept of life repeating itself. Others have paid tribute to the wonderful performances of Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell, but everything that happens is worth watching over and over again. It never becomes stale because there is some basic existential truth in Groundhog Day. It's also a puzzle that is never solved.Recently, I heard on a TV documentary (I can't remember what it was about) that 2nd February is Candlemas, an ancient festival linked to folk tradition as well as a religious festival. Traditionally, on this date, animals which hibernate such as bears and wolves will come out and inspect the weather. If they see fine weather, they anticipate that harsh winter weather will continue for another 40 days, and they return to their hibernation. I feel that the choice of Groundhog Day as the day on which Phil experiences being trapped in the winter world of Punxsatawney is meaningful for this reason as well as what happens to the main character.Overall, it's a very hopeful story, with a wonderful ending, and I will never grow tired of watching it every year.For everyone except Phil, that day is a brand new 24 hours, and everything happens once. Phil experiences the day repeatedly, so he can learn something each time. The others meet him anew, or on Rita's case, have only 1 day to get to know him better. Still, by the end he has learnt how to maximise the impact of his interactions because he only has that day in which to do it. Another thing that occurred to me recently is poignant: his Bed and Breakfast establishment is homely but doesn't have hot showers! The day on which Phil is stuck is one on which he must take a cold shower - every day. That's purgatory, by my reckoning.Update: I watch this film every year on 2nd February, or as close as possible. This year I was impressed again by Bill Murray's wonderful performance, the cheerfulness of all the characters and the life-affirming message of the film. I was also surprised when I awoke on 3rd February to see that it had snowed overnight (in London, UK), and therefore I think the weather was telling me that it was indeed the day after Groundhog Day!",9,3,6,2 February 2011
Steve Jobs," too much talk, too many arguments
","I was interested in this film because I am a Macintosh fan, so I was curious about the life of Steve Jobs. Unfortunately, so much of the movie was spent on people having hinge arguments and showing Jobs to be a very unpleasant man. I don't feel that I learned very much about him or how the Mac came to be developed, and since I had one of the first Mac computers, this was of interest to me.Very dense dialogue and a disappointing film. If Steve Jobs was really such a difficult person, then we needed to know, but it didn't make a satisfying film. I don't like watching endless fights, with no break, and this film was one long fight as far as I could tell. My attention wandered very quickly.",6,0,0,8 December 2016
Love Actually," Stand out moments make this worth revisiting
","I like aspects of this film very much. Every Christmas, I watch this because my sister loves it and she wants me to watch it with her. Sometimes I think 'oh no, not again' but then I remember the brilliant moments in the various sub-plots that make this a memorable film worth seeing again. For my taste, there is too much unnecessary bad language, and sexual references directed at children, which seems inappropriate to me even if it's a mature treatment of the subject. But I can usually forgive these lapses. It's well-acted and the performances that stand out for me are Emma Thompson, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant. All are doing what they do best, playing English people struggling with their emotions.It is a very British film and the reason why it may not have done so well in the US may not just be down to the PM's speech (referred to in earlier comments). There are a lot of subtle and not-so subtle jokes, and overall, it's a feel-good movie with some realism thrown in.I have read the other reviews on this site and it's interesting to see how polarised the opinions are. I'm tending to agree more with the negative comments and I think the problem with the film is that it's very unrealistic, and simplistic, and there are too many stories covered in a superficial way. Romantics might love it, but anyone who has a strong cringe reflex will probably dislike it. My previous comments still stand, but I'm not a big fan of it. I also think it does a dis-service to the image of Britain and the jokes are on the whole not very funny, unfortunately.",6,1,2,29 December 2010
The Water Diviner," Very impressive and moving
","I didn't know what to expect from this film, and the subject seemed depressing: a father goes searching for his dead sons in Turkey. However, it was gripping, involving, full of 3- dimensional characters and depths of meaning. The cultural authenticity looked impressive to me, although I as no expert.. All I knew prior to this film was that the Dardanelles campaign in WW1 cost many Anzac lives and was regarded as a disaster. For Russell Crowe's family it was the loss of 3 sons, and all that the father could do was go to where they died to find them.The story builds to a gripping climax and the ending was completely unexpected. I was very impressed, having always been a Russell Crowe fan, with his ability to direct and produce something so meaningful and historically informative, while at the same time giving us a story so moving and ultimately rewarding. Very glad I made the effort to see this.",8,2,5,3 December 2016
Moonrise Kingdom," Escape into Wes Anderson's imagination
","I have just seen this for the first time - what took me so long? It lived up to my expectations and exceeded them. The young cast members were assured and played their roles brilliantly, while the older stars did an excellent job of creating a credible world, all within the imagination of the director. I always know that Anderson's world is not like the real one, and I think anyone who enjoys this movie can do so because they can suspend disbelief and enter into that world of imagination. I loved the music score as well, being a fan of Benjamin Britten, especially Noye's Fludde, which was evoked so well with the children dressed up as animals, and the tempest at the end of the film, it all made sense to me, and the whole was a masterpiece of storytelling.Great comedy and poignancy, supported by the excellent children's voices singing the Britten soundtrack. If you can remember what it was like to be a child and want to have adventures, this is the movie for you, no matter how old you are (I am in my 50s).",9,1,3,29 April 2014
The Great Gatsby," Not my cup of tea
","I think this movie will suit anyone who loved Moulin Rouge. Unfortunately I didn't and this movie suffered from the same drawbacks for me. It was too garish, loud and modern in it's soundtrack. I love the era of the 1920s and love the music as well, so I would have preferred some suitable music. Baz Luhrmann's flair is well known and he is very talented. The cast are very good and the story (as far as I know) was shown well. But it didn't suit me and so I can't rate it highly. I love Carey Mulligan and Tobey Maguire, and I liked most of the other cast members. Leonardo DiCaprio is now an established mature actor and having recently seen The Aviator, his Gatsby reminded me of Howard Hughes in terms of his excesses (although not in his paranoia). Just a cautionary note that the visuals are very hectic and this is not your typical costume drama, but the anyone who know Luhrmann's style should know that.",6,0,0,31 August 2017
