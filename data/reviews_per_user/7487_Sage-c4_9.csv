The Avengers," Nice bit of fun, but
","I want my Noprize! How did Harry Dean Stanton know to wait for Hulk to 'shrink back down' to pants size, but then ask is he's an alien? I liked the Council of Elrond scene, where the influence of the One Ring, I mean Loki's staff, causes strife among the Avengers. And when Bugs, I mean Thor, steps out of the falling elevator just before it crashes. I did not like the way the Darkworld warriors all collapsed when the portal closed, like in Independence Day. Same illogic as in Oblivion. Look folks, in Independence Day, the alien fighters drew their power from the mother ship. Don't copy stuff you don't understand. And don't copy DCStuff like the every cell phones a tracking device from the Dark Knight. You can do better. Black Widow is more deceptive thank Loki? Nice. Is that Thanos at the end? Apocalips? The Skrull king? I know I've seen that mug before. Not really better than the Spider-Man or Ironman movies, but a tad better than the Captain America, Hulk, or Thor solo films.",7,3,7,26 May 2013
Skyfall," Good, Just Good
","This installment does not make the impact that Casino Royale did, but it does better than Quantum. On the upside, the stunts are lovely, the scenery, too. Then the clichés take over, and struggle against an almost too ardent attempt to humanize these characters, to give them depth and dimension. Why? Even Severine, the disposable.woman in this film, is held in bondage to the villain by fear, we are told, as though this longstanding device needs explanation. Layers of insulating mystery are removed from M as her unquestioned power and backstory are examined and revealed. And the central mystery that seemingly brings us back to the theater each time, Bond's own backstory, is laid out in far too specific detail and comicbook psychological rationalization. I had no idea Bond had once resided in Wayne Manor, EC, nor that Alfred was still the caretaker there. Did Fleming really write any of that? Finally, we see that what drives the film is not really internal story logic, but a convergence of seemingly smart career moves, and really, an abandonment of innovation. The film drives inexorably toward an integration with the Connery era films. Smart recasting is done before our eyes - good for you, Lord Voldemort, Lady Calypso! Nothing pays the bills like a serial. But with the Bond backstory so well documented, will Bond intrigue us enough to justify a fourth film? Will Craig be up for another, or will Bond have to have facial reconstruction?",7,0,8,8 December 2012
Kung Fu Panda," Perfect execution of a subtle concept
","Of course this film is directed toward a child audience, but there is plenty for adults to appreciate. First, the excellent design. Every frame - credits too - is simply gorgeous. Then the casting. Jack Black is The big fat panda. James Hong, Randall Duk Kim, and Ian McShane are likewise irreplaceable. Seth Rogan and David Cross could have exchanged roles, as could Lucy Liu and Angelina Jolie, without significant alteration to the story. The rest of the voice actors - yes, even Hoffman (not quite filling the hole in the world left by Mako Iwamatsu's passing) - could have been anyone. (But that's almost the point!) The action, the visual jokes, the pace - all perfect.But what really gets me is the sustained ironic take on the mono-myth formula. Again and again the implied allusions to the 'foundling prince whose coming was foretold' are set up only to be shrugged off without explicit acknowledgment. The writers of this film get it: we all know that story - it's in our bones - so there's no need to waste a moment of dialog on it. What keeps it light and alive is the repeated thwarting of our anticipation that the clichés will take over. It never happens; the clichés remain pawns, the butts of jokes. Finally, what makes this film great. This story doesn't merely put a new twist on a timeless tale, it turns the hero myth on its head: the chosen one can be Anyone, even an antihero can become a hero: 'There is no secret ingredient.' What an affirmation for the doubt-fettered children of our over-informed cynical age. PS If you love this film for the same reasons, don't bother with the sequel.",10,0,0,23 December 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Khan u believe it?
","As the second installment in the rebooted 'alternate reality' Star Trek universe, this film does a passable job of introducing a few new faces for some old characters. Plot wise, it does not follow very closely on the heels of the first installment. Like the original TV series, it could just as well be viewed independently from the first, though if you happen to have grown up in an alternate reality yourself, you may not understand who the principal characters are. But this isn't much of a disadvantage, because as an alternate reality project, the film deals somewhat unexpectedly with many of the characters. Christine Chappell is mentioned but not shown - maybe int ST3? Pike does not wind up in a wheelchair. And Khan, well, he doesn't quote Herman Melville, or do his own stunts, apparently. Cumberbatch is sadly just not as convincing as a super warrior as Montalban. He is as coldly calculating as you please, but just not physical, devious, or demonic as the role demands. Mostly he seems a little lost, a guest actor who is unsure of his welcome. As far as the rest of the film, there is one tribble, which kind of misses the point of tribbles. And the silly use of Khan's super blood raises the question of how Carol Marcus will be utilized in the next film. One thing for sure the next sequel will not be titled The Search for Kirk.",7,0,5,26 May 2013
Oblivion," It's okay...it's okay
","I saw this in IMAX, so it was very big and very loud. It also seemed a bit long, somewhat predictable, but not boring.A simple story line creates a typical Tom Cruise scifi action vehicle, differing from Vanilla Sky and Minority Report by employing far fewer supporting roles, fewer props, and bland featureless CGI backgrounds. Essentially a mash-up of Wall-e and Zardoz, with major visual, thematic, and sequence nods to Star Trek, Star Wars, Alien, Matrix, Inception, Adjustment Bureau, Mad Max, Terminator, Total Recall, Armageddon...yeah, it's pretty short on original elements. There's even a bit of Jerry Maguire and Top Gun here.Still, what emerges is a story, Hamlet or Oedipus, bent to accommodate a fairly happy ending. SPOILERS: There are a few plot devices that jar, like how the flight recorder continued to monitor the command module after separation, or the unexplained discrepancy in the fertility of Julia and Victoria, and why do the drones, which are clearly presented throughout the film as independently fueled and autonomously programmed, fall out of the air instead of continuing their attack? These issues knocked me out of the story, but since the illogic is revealed late in the film, the damage is contained. Morgan Freeman does a credible turn in a limited roll that is just a bit more passive than one wishes. Andrea Riseborough does some real acting, though it's mostly acting suspicious. Her character is actually developed too much for the purpose of the plot, and an opportunity to acknowledge her Ophelia antecedent with an aquatic mishap is missed. And if Victoria is overdeveloped, Julia, played by Olga Kurylenko, is little more than a prop. Really, a little less of Tom figuring it all out, and a little more of Olga, maybe listening to the flight recorder she was so determined to recover, would make the ending of the film more emotionally satisfying. Again, a bit too passive to engage.",7,0,0,20 April 2013
Kung Fu Panda 2," My old enemy - stairs
","This film jettisons the essential tone and message of the original, while retaining the superficial elements of the characters and setting.Having successfully manipulated the clichés of the mono-myth and countless references to action films into an original, funny and heart-warming masterpiece, the franchise loses its way with this dud. Here the writers become the tools of the story-we-all-know, every step predictable. Gary Oldman plays (as usual) the villain with a thousand faces, flawlessly, yes, but that's the problem. There's no humanity in the peacock to make it interesting. Only Dennis Hopper can project a villain less sympathetically. James Woods or Jeremy Irons? You know the type.Where is the REAL Jack Black? David Spade, Jay Baruchel, or Norm Macdonald might as well have voiced this cartoon panda with as vivaciously. The rest of the cast follow suit. Gone is any sense of play. The characters just plod along in the ruts left by countless re-tellings. The one good line in the film indicates what's wrong - up and down the stairs every hero story follows - one step at a time, skipping few (there's no panda princess locked in the tower). It's just boring!And then the ominous threat of another cliché-driven sequel tagged onto the end. I sincerely hope the franchise-holders reevaluate what they're doing, and resuscitate the life of the original, rather than clone another simulacrum to stagger blindly two hours.",Null,1,3,23 December 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," I sat stupefied with incredulous boredom
","This film entertains while failing to enthrall as did its older brother, LOTR. I sat with a frown on my face for most of the running time, relieved by two or three chuckles.It has been suggested that Tolkien's appeal lies not his story-telling, but in his ability to transport the reader to that alternate reality, Middle Earth. Jackson's LOTR films succeeded, despite various compromises, in that same effect. This film does not.What went wrong? Too much effort to integrate with established LOTR orthodoxy, I suspect. I was transported, not to Middle Earth, but to the sound stages of the previous films. I looked, not at characters, but at actors playing them. Freeman, Nesbit, and Armitage turn in real performances, but most of the actors reprising roles were wooden. Maybe because they so defined the characters in the earlier films, Jackson has been satisfied with takes wherein they simply get their lines right. Only Lee and Blachett add any dimension to their LOTR characters; the rest fall short.It starts right away. Holm looks and sounds slightly embalmed as old Bilbo. Is it CGI makeup? Something not right in the eyebrows; lack of facial expression, intonation husky and flat with the intervening years. McKellen likewise turns in a diminished performance, his expressive range is nearly as narrow as Holm's.Is Holm wearing contacts to match Freeman's eye color? If so, it's a mistake. We could instead infer that his eyes have been drained of color by the Ring - compare Gollum's watery orbs. Wood is no longer boyish, despite makeup, his voice more mature. Too bad he couldn't be digitally lifted from Huckleberry Finn or Oliver Twist. Too much telling instead of showing. Can't show us Sackville-Bagginses stealing the silver? Then leave it out. Holm narrates a dwarve backstory so parallel to the 'forging of the rings' flashback in Fellowship it's almost a parody, with Thorin a three-quarter-scale Isildur.Does Jackson think audiences will watch only one of the trilogies? If some element is present in one, why duplicate it in the other? Chandeliers and moths - really?Azog (does the name mean 'little Sauron rip-off'?) is a recurring mistake throughout. Many of the iconic scenes from the novel are spoiled by this CGI construct, a sort of recombinant (WO)Khan/Ahab/Moby-Dick chimera. Why does this character exist? The Company does not need pursuit or a lurking enemy: it's is GOING to the Lonely Mountain, and will encounter plenty of obstacles to keep up the suspense.Roast Mutton is hurried and under-acted as a result. The entrance to Rivendell recreates the Race to the Ford with Azog in the place of the pursuing Wraiths. I like the inclusion of Radagast, but here is another timewaster, with the brown wizard distracting the pursuing orcs, with every tedious element of a video game cut scene. The main characters stand idly by, waiting with the audience for it to end, so play can resume. Fortunately, the DVD release will allow us to skip the scene. Then Rivendell, like Hobbitton, somehow larger and more elaborate, but curiously empty of inhabitants and stage business. Weaving, despite rumors that the elves would be jollier, looking more glum and fretful even than in LOTR, when there should be a knowing twinkle in his eye. La-la-la-lally, indeed... Happiest moment was the Storm Giant battle, which might have wound up on the cutting room floor along with Tom Bombadil for all the difference it makes to the plot. Still, it's marred by referencing the collapsing stairs of Moria. And not enough lightning.The goblins should still be isolated in the Misty Mountains, jealous of their borders, not yet under thrall to Sauron. Instead, they seem to have direct communication with other baddies. Humphries' Great Goblin sounds about halfway between Bruce and Dame Edna, a little too sarcastic, and not quite suspiciously enraged. The Great Goblin diminishes his own terrifying status by threatening to...turn them over to Azog. You've got to be joking!With so much material added from outside the text of the Hobbit novel proper, how can the result be so unoriginal? In the novel, we get the sense of Bilbo slogging along, not really comprehending the magnitude of the journey. But the reader gets a sense of a vast, unknown world around him. Not in this film. Like Lucas before him, Jackson has created a prequel which diminishes the scope of the original, rather than augmenting it. Middle Earth grows smaller with each recreated set.That this film, with its enormous budget and gifted pool of talent and technology, fails to supersede the humble Rankin-Bass animated production, is the most damning comment I can make. I liked, not loved, it.",6,4,13,15 December 2012
Prometheus," Basis for reowning the franchise
","I've waited a long time for Scott to take up the reins of this franchise, patiently watched as it was bastardized, homogenized, and hybridized. Not a single sequel has risen to the superlative level of the first Alien film, and to some extent, neither does this prequel. But it captures something the sequels missed - mystery. Here we learn that the giant pilot of the crashed alien ship was not merely a previous victim of the titular creature, but a member of a master race much more intimately and physiologically linked to humanity than we ever suspected. Yet the answers to questions ignored in the sequels because of their focus on the creature, lead to more questions, and an reductio ad absurdum 'who created the creator' possibility for unlimited serialization. This film is the first in the franchise to show us something we didn't already know about the creature from the first film, though I found a couple manifestations of its life cycle inconsistent with alien life cycle orthodoxy and others a bit implausible (zombie mode) or unexplained (rapid growth without food). Fassbender is a great David, though unlike Holm's Ash, he fails to appear innocuous in the opening sequence, coming off too sinister to make subsequent events surprising. Actually, the only surprise from his character is his apparent willingness in the final scene to set aside his own agenda in favor of that of Rapace's Shaw. Her heroics should eclipse those of Weaver's Ripley, considering the extent of her trauma, but somehow her character is too muted and epicentric to draw cheers at the moment of her coup. Enough puzzles remain to authorize a sequel: why did David choose Holloway to betray, why is Weyland played by such a young actor (okay that one is obvious), why didn't Charlize Theron turn aside when the Gale house was touching down from Kansas? Really, she can't be that disposable, considering Vickers' resemblance to Ripley. Will Shaw make it to the emerald city with only Toto in her duffle (I'll count the rest of David as the tin man, since the cowardly geologist and the brainless biologist already bought the farm). Guess we'll just have to wait for the next installment. And finally, I am SO glad this did not flaceplant like Robin Hood.",8,1,3,26 May 2013
Cloud Atlas," A patchwork pastiche or an omlet du homage
","Filled with accomplished acting, but like everything else about it, uneven. The multiple roles played by the principle actors seem to have been given varying attention, and the mediocre makeup does not conceal the poor casting for some of the roles. Sadly, Tom Hanks never vanished into any of his roles. He remains the American Everyman whether playing the post apocalyptic Hawaiian tribesman with the Beyond Thunderdome dialect, or the despicable physician with the Austen Powers teeth. Then there's a bewildering mashup of Fu Manchu makeup, Bert the chimney sweep accent, and Caponean efficacy (where's the baseball bat?). Hanks remains. Hugo Weaving essentially reprises his Matrix Agent twice, once with heavy makeup and once without. He does a campy turn as a Cuckoos Nest nurse, and a mesmerizing and convincingly diabolical job as an Elm Streetesque phantom, marred not by his acting, but by some of his lines, seemingly lifted from the recent Exocist Begins (or is it Xorcist Origins?) film. Still a stunningly creepy performance. Hugh Grant does a fair James Caan for a Brit, vanishes into exotic tribesman makeup, but then the olderizing makeup fails poolside - wierdly, he didn't even appear British in that scene... I am not a Halle Berry fan, but her work in this film is refined, maybe the understatement makes her stand out alongside the Tarantino- infused characters. I believed her characters, despite the transforming makeup. The rest of the film is just good. There is some real emotional poignancy to the Do Androids Dream of Logan's Run segment and the closet melodrama about the music (I swear I've seen that before, but I can't place it). Cloud Atlas is not an original, but an assemblage of homages to other films, unfortunately of several genres, ranking from camp to high art. The uneven application of talent - script, acting, makeup - is not an achievement worthy of praise. Nevertheless, the good pieces shine through, and are worth watching. If one wasn't constantly distracted trying to remember where one had seen each scene in another film, it would rank somewhere above Waterworld and on a par with Fifth Element, somewhat below 12 Monkeys, and half an order of magnitude below Inception.",6,0,2,7 December 2012
