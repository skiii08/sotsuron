Blade Runner 2049," Disappointed
","Granted, that I have not yet seen the original Blade Runner, I was very keen to see this one, also with regards to the positive reviews and ratings , that it had received. And I have to say, that both my wife and me were quite disappointed in the end. Good things first: Certainly the visuals are stunning, the music is fitting and the story potentially interesting. But IMO this is it. In the end there is no noteworthy or rememberable scene in the whole movie. The dialog, if any, is mostly neglectable and why people are praising the acting is beyond me. Ryan Gossling is playing the same thing as in 'Drive' or 'The place beyond pines' as the cool guy, who doesn't really talk much and just looks manly. In the case of Harrison Ford, if, as others reviewers have pointed, this was his best performance, then I am wondering, what he actually did lately, as I also don't see him shine in any way in this role. And this basically goes on for the rest of the cast, where the main underlying problem IMO is, that all there roles are so underdeveloped, that ultimately I didn't care for any of them. In the end I found this movie a visual appealing piece of art, which failed to entertain due to the above mentioned issues. So compared to other movies, who are visually appealing and entertaining (Zhang Yimou's 'Hero' comes to my mind as an example), I don't see, why this should be a masterpiece.",5,28,64,6 October 2017
We Were Soldiers," Pathos and patriotism in annoying doses
","Based on the IMDb rating, I just decided to give this movie a shot, already expecting to see some degree of pathos, cliche and patriotism to be included, but I didn't expect it to be in such unbearable doses. The first part of the movie is basically a blue-print of how not to do character development, as it basically is one long boring drag to show, that each and every American soldier is one good guy, who loves god, his wife, kids, country and most of all his platoon. Same as for all other messages, that the movie wants to get through later on, each and every single scene seems to scream, why deliver this message in a subtle way, if You can basically nail it with a sledgehammer into the forehead of even the most simple minded person. So if this message by end of part one of the movie through all those scenes of soldiers cuddling with their individual family members and bonding with their platoon mates has not gotten through yet, Mel Gibson's pep talk to his fellow soldiers before going to war should have ultimately made sure of it.So I was hoping for the movie to get better in part 2, but it just didn't . It just went further downhill. Every scene following the start of the actual fight reeks of one of the following messages, which are mercilessly unsubtle carved into the audience's forehead:1.) We want to be a little different than other war movies, by giving the enemy a glimpse of human character. So let's give them a few seconds to look at the same moon as the American soldiers and one of them, although he doesn't have a line to say, can even have a picture of a girlfriend, but that is as good as it gets, because ultimately the enemy is not much more than ...2.) ...cannonfodder , who doesn't seem to have many ideas, what to actually do with their guns, as in one scene after the other, they continue to either run or sneak towards the American soldiers, either not shooting or in the rare cases, when they do, failing to hit anything, resulting in most cases, that they look like trying to merely overrun the enemy and essentially even failing to finish off an outnumbered, cut off platoon without ammo, while....3.) ... at the same time the American Heroes are essentially impenetrable to bullets, culminating in the laughable scene, where Mel Gibson is standing in the middle of an open field, that is supposed to be overrun by the enemy, with bullets flying all around, just aiming to look manly and thoughtful at the same time for a minute or so....4.) ...while the comparably few gruesome deaths of American soldiers almost exclusively serve the purpose of reminding the audience of what was said in part 1, by giving them dramatic lines - tell XYZ I love him/her, I am so proud to die for my country etc. !!! - or having them gloriously killed, while trying to carry another wounded/killed comrade.And if this last message still has not been understood by each and everyone by the time, when the battle is won, Mel Gibson's last talk with Barry Pepper - I will never forgive myself, that I have lived and my boys have not or something of that kind - surely does the trick in its usual subtle manner.There are a lot of movies out there with less production value than this one, but this movie for me is so annoying in its simplistic and lopsided messages and even worse the way it delivers them by treating the audience like simpletons who need to be spoon fed those messages, that this warrants nothing more than one star.",1,0,4,6 September 2019
Parasite," 8 star rating for this?
","I have watched some Korean movies, part of which I genuinely liked, but this one...how this gets an eight star rating is beyond me. I have to admit, that those have been some of the longest two hours, that I have spent in a movie Theater. The movie is neither funny (it might be the dubbing, but I have maybe chuckled twice during the whole movie), nor shocking (unless You haven't seen movies before), it was filled with exclusively unlikeable characters, it was absolutely predictive, drawn out way too long and ultimately was just one big boredom. Yes, it covered different genres, but other movies did the same, just much better.",3,45,115,18 October 2019
