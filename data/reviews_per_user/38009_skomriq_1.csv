Blade Runner 2049," Slow motion
","I hate myself for watching that movie. So much expectations and finally one big nothing. What a waste of time. If Rayon Gosling walked just a little bit faster, they could make the film at least a hour shorter. The movie was boring, slow, emotionless garbage. Donct watch it.
