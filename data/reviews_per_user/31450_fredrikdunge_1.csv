Iron Man 3," All in all an entertaining movie
","First of I will say that I review this as a movie goer I have never read the iron man comics or never been much into comics at all, especially not Marvell.That said I enjoyed the movie, several other have down rated it because it wasn't faithful to the comic, well I don't see the issue, if you want the comic read the comics this is a movie and its purpose is to sell itself. So no magician as villain? Well that's because there is no magic in the marvel movie universe, even Thor isn't actually a 'god' but just a sufficiently advanced alien. The plot was good although I will agree with others in that it was perhaps a little to easy to knock mister stark out of his suit, but I can see why they did this. The writers have obviously understood that we (the regular movie goer, not the comic book fan)like Tony Stark a lot more than we like iron man, sure the suit is cool but its the wit of RDJ, and the excellent soundtrack that makes the Ironman movies what they are. this movie certainly gives us the former, we have RDj runnign around without the suit most of the movie. I don't mind, the boring villains (the extremis guys, the corporate evil guy is actually somewhat enjoyable) are a far worse thing if you ask me. There's lots of action lots of explosions and lots of Tony acting somewhat like Tony. However, the movie have looked far to much on batman, especially in the beginning. Its far to dark with bombs going of and terrorists making statements on TV. Also the save the president storyline hasn't been cool since airforce-1 with Harrison ford. But my biggest gripe with the movie is the soundtrack. instead of Thunderstruck with ac/dc or even better ironman with black sabbath we're treated to something that sound remarkably like the batman theme. Yeah Ironman and Batman are similar in many ways, and yes Nolans batman trilogy probably got higher ratings than the iron man movies but when it comes down to it they were never really competing. Iron man was about kicking ass and chewing bubblegum (or rather drink scotch and sleeping around) more than a broody guy fighting darkness. and instead of playing its strengths it tried to be something else. Sure it gave us more Tony but it missed why we like Tony. Never the less a enjoyable movie but in retrospect considering the theme of the villains you should've gone for House of fire with Alice Cooper for soundtrack (or something similar). And then built in the direction that took you. It's a good action flick, with 7/10 better than the 6/10 i gave the second movie but far worse than the 9/10 I gave the first one.",7,0,1,11 May 2013
