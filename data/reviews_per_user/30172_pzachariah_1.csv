Hereditary," Bloody fantastic
","This isn't your typical jump scare movie. If you want that, go elsewhere.Really effed at times- be wary.This a slow, psychological thriller that will eff with you. I felt a big unnerving uneasiness in my chest watching certain parts of it.Absolutely new and exciting, different from any mainstream horror I've seen.And the best horrors are always the one that leave you with no hope.",10,0,3,3 November 2019
