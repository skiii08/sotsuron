United 93," Wonderful movie! 4.5 out of 5 Stars
","I thought that United 93 was a wonderful movie. It starts out as a normal day then it progresses into one of the saddest days in American History. It's so emotional when they storm the hijackers, it could have been written better, but the directing was fantastic. I would rate this movie as a 4.5 out of 5. I took off half a point because of the writing, it didn't focus enough on the United 93 flight. Overall this was a fantastic movie, a must see for all you patriots like me. Though out the movie there is a problem getting authorization from the president to shoot down these planes. This adds to the suspense. This movie is fantastic and is a must see for anyone not only the patriots but for all people who take an interest in 9-11, and want to know how all of it happened.",9,0,2,22 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," This movie was fantastic! Great Acting by Heyden Christensen and Ewan McGregor
","I'm not the greatest Star Wars fan, but i loved this movie. Star Wars 3 is without a doubt one of George Lucas' greatest Star Wars movie yet. I will have to admit that the NOOOOOOOOOOOO at the end was a little cheesy, but you can not condeem the whole movie on one scene. This movie includes great acting by Heyden and Ewan McGregor, the movie also include the tieing together of the first 2 and last 3 movies. The greatest ending in a movie i have ever seen in a long time. The movie ends with (well doesn't end but close to the end) Obi-wan and Anakin Skywalker having a long dual with, of course, light-sabers. Anakin loses, of course, and gets his legs cut off, along with another arm. I would just like to walk up to Heyden and slap him for killing Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) and saving Supreme Chancellor Palpatine ... WHY ANAKIN WHY... I also do not get how you people can watch this movie and come out saying that George Lucas has Failed. THIS MOVIE IS A MASTERPIECE, I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO IS WANTING TO SEE IT, THIS IS A WONDERFUL MOVIE.",10,3,14,7 June 2005
