Requiem for a Dream," High on the incredulity scale.
","I echo most of the negative comments, but the main problem I had with the film was my continual questioning of events as the story progressed. Drugs are bad, and that is fine, but they are NOT that hard to find. In essence, the problems faced by half of the cast was a result of the scarcity of narcotics in NEW YORK CITY. Should I find this scenario credible? One can manage heroin addiction using prescription painkillers (which is what folks like this would have resorted to), rather than driving 600 miles away or engaging in an uncomfortable orgy. They could have scored some dilaudid, hydrocodone, oxycontin, or even methadone to get them through the dry streak. Two thousand dollars in hand, and not an idea about what to do? Actors all did fine. The characters were unsympathetic. The story is depressing but simultaneously leaves one reticent for the fact that there are not many redeeming qualities exhibited by the users. Tyrone and Marion did not have shocking denouements...their path is standard for many users. Emotionally manipulating...visuals were fair...story was simple-minded. I was underwhelmed, and I do not find this film to be particularly artsy, though I will grant that it is daring in some sense.",3,3,5,10 February 2007
