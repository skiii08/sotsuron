The Avengers," A movie that assembles and conquers.
","Wow, it has finally arrived. Marvel has had one hell of a project, coming up with movies exploring the origin stories of some of the most iconic superheroes of all time while adding small but subtle connections to each other as a way to show fans what is coming over the horizon. The result is an all-out marvel mash as Earth's mightiest heroes have come together to face a threat no one hero could possibly face alone. They are the Avengers.Loki, the god of mischief, has come to conquer the Earth with an unspeakable alien force to back him up. To make matters worse, he has obtained an ancient artifact with virtually limitless power as his disposal. In desperation, Nick Fury, director of the peace-keeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D., assembles together the greatest heroes the world has ever seen: Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Incredible Hulk. If these extraordinary independent individuals can learn to work together, their combined might be enough to conquer this global threat.This is every comic book geeks dream team and dream movie. The faces we have all grown up with and come to love finally together in one film. Normally, such a task is highly risky because not only do the filmmakers have to be faithful to the comics, but also appeal to what the fans would want to see in The Avengers, not to mention avoid any plot holes. Thankfully, this movie does it all plus more. It is, dare I say it, incredible! The action scenes are some of the best in the superhero genre, lots of shooting, punching, and, of course, smashing. Things get really insane and everything in sight gets totally destroyed as the forces of good and evil duke it out. All the characters have practically equal back story, interactions, and amount of fighting, even characters like Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Nick Fury. With this, not one seems left out or doesn't get enough of these elements. Dialog is written very well and there's a surprising amount of comedy throughout the film (and it's hard not to laugh with it). There's lots of great moments and none of it seems the least bit corny.In conclusion, this will satisfy anyone, especially the fans. Everything people hope to see is brought to life and it kicks serious butt. With fantastic action scenes, excellent special effects, well-written script, cool music, and surprisingly great comedy, The Avengers is sure to satisfy in every way. On a scale of one to ten, I would give this movie a twenty (it's a shame I can't physically give such a rating)! Go check out this awesome flick and enjoy! AVENGERS, ASSEMBLE!",10,7,15,7 May 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," As Holmes would say, 'Most intriguing.'
","Having become a bit of a cinematic icon, the world's greatest detective returns in this epic sequel and movie adaptation of the classic books. Now, shall we proceed in this most fascinating entry of the detective saga.Sherlock Holmes has been on the trail of his archenemy Professor James Moriarty and, as expected, Watson is once again been dragged into Sherlock's manhunt. Tensions between countries are rising and Moriarty is up to something terrible. Employing his usual tactics and coming up with new strategies, Sherlock sets out to put a halt to his enemy's plans once and for all.The old charm is back and so is the great comedy as well as the intense action. The action scenes are a real spectacle, again employing great camera work and slow-motion that intensifies the battles. Once again, we have a mystery that really messes with your head and, as Sherlock once put it, even the smallest detail has a good value of information. Moriarty proves to be Sherlock's intellectual equal, which further raises the challenge for our dear detective.This ingenious endeavor proves to be as great as the first film. It's recommended that you sit back, relax, and watch as Sherlock Holmes delves into this deadly Game of Shadows.",8,9,19,17 December 2011
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," A decent historical hack-fest.
","Man, what were they smoking? Based on the best-selling novel, this little film was brought to life by the dark vision of Tim Burton of all people and what we got was the story of the supposed secret life of our sixteenth president Abraham Lincoln. Personally, I still find the concept of old honest Abe hacking his way through some creepy-looking vampires rather ridiculous. Sure, I can take cowboys fighting dinosaurs or aliens, but at least those make a lot more sense than this film and are therefore more interesting.Anyway, is this movie bad? Well, not really because I've seen worse. Much worse. The story, as silly as it is, is pretty interesting and it ties in pretty well with significant historical moments in Lincoln's life. The vampires themselves are actually pretty scary at times and the action scenes are entertaining. The cast was surprising like Mary-Elizabeth Winstead, Dominic Cooper, Benjamin Walker, etc., performing quite well and doing a decent job conveying emotions. The rest is pretty much downhill as most of the characters are not that special, the villains are not very interesting, the plot again is pretty silly, a few things left me confused, and there are some inconsistencies and plot holes throughout the film.Overall, I wasn't genuinely impressed, then again I didn't expect much from a film like this, but at least I got some good out of this movie. Not really recommended, but if you want to throw reality out the window and have a good time, then check this out. Otherwise, skip this one before it drains the fun out of you like the blood-sucking monsters in this movie.",5,0,1,26 November 2012
Mulan," A great movie that entertains with honor.
","This was a very interesting direction Disney went in terms of storytelling with their classic charm. Based on an actual Chinese story, Mulan is unlike anything the filmmakers of Disney ever created.Mulan herself is very unique compared to most women from the Disney universe. She's no princess or pretty girl wanting more or waiting for a happy ending, instead she's a bit of a social outcast stuck in the traditional family norm the Chinese had with women at the time who just wishes to be herself and prove that she's no obedient little housewife-to-be. Mulan takes a big risk and ends up becoming the heroine China needs to save them from the crafty and ruthless Shan Yu, who leads the invading Huns.All the other characters are a true delight. Mushu (Eddie Murphy), Mulan's guardian dragon, is a hilarious character who proves to quite helpful on certain occasions and brings much of the comedy into the film. Captain Shang is tough and determined, but even he has his insecurities, which makes him a unique love interest to Mulan. The villain Shan Yu is not someone to be trifled with or underestimated because he's cold, calculating, and powerful as heck. The trio (Yau, Ling, and Chien-Po) are really fun to watch as they hilariously interact with other characters such as Mulan, Chi-Fu, and even each other.This movie has the perfect blend of amazing art design, epic action scenes, wonderful music that complements the various scenes, memorable songs, great comedy, intricate storytelling, flawless animation, and excellent themes. The filmmakers must have really pushed themselves to make this into an awesome and unique edition to the Disney franchise and they weren't too afraid to get a little dark and make the situations the characters are going through as real and sometimes as dangerous as possible, both the menacing Huns and their own somewhat strict social traditions.Overall, this is indeed a rare flower that blooms the most beautifully. I consider this to be one of the greatest Disney films ever made, if not the best. It is highly recommended that you check this movie out and marvel at the cultural and cinematic wonder that is Mulan.",10,2,2,21 December 2011
Iron Man 2," Twice the iron, twice the fun.
","Alright, a good sequel among numerous bad ones out there. The first Iron Man movie was an incredible feat in terms of action, story, effects, music, and so on. Naturally, such a film would be tricky to beat, but luckily with such a huge fan base and source material from the comics, Jon Favreau was able to sort of 'upgrade' his antics in this hit sequel that's sure to blow you away.Plot: Tony Stark has brought peace to the world (and revealed his secret identity) thanks to his high tech battle suit and most people love him. With this comes some unfortunate problems such as a strained relationship with his assistant Pepper Potts and the government seeking to get its hands on the Iron Man armor, but those are the least of his worries. A figment from his family's past has come back to haunt Tony: Ivan Vanko a.k.a. Whiplash who seeks revenge on the Stark family and he has rival weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer backing him up. Even with the help of Rhodey a.k.a. War Machine and Natasha Romanoff a.k.a. Black Widow, can Iron Man rise up to the challenge? Time to suit up! This is a worthy edition to the Avengers storyline. First of all, the action scenes are absolutely great, plenty of things get blown up and the effects make it even better. I love the story as we explore more of Tony's character as he tries to deal with his newfound fame and threats both physical and mental. All the other characters have a good amount of development as well, especially Pepper and Rhodey who becomes War Machine. The villain Whiplash is surprisingly a great villain; not only does he look cool and that he's a significant physical threat, but he's also very smart and tends to be fairly manipulative.My only major complaint is the secondary villain Justin Hammer. He's very condescending and egotistical, which often gets to point of being quite annoying. Everyone knows it and everyone hates him. He makes you feel like punching him in the face, which I guess is the point but nevertheless he's a pain and so is Senator Stern who also wants the Iron Man armor.In conclusion, despite the above problem, Iron Man 2 is a film that may actually be better than the first one. It only furthers the excitement of when the Avengers come together. It's twice the iron, twice the action, and twice the fun, so I recommend that you give this one a watch.",8,0,1,3 April 2012
Spider-Man 2," 8 limbs of awesome superhero fun!
","Spider-Man 2. Considered by many to be the best of the web-slinging trilogy, this movie nailed it as one of the greatest moments in the Spider-man history. Appropriately, there are about eight reasons why I love this masterpiece.Story: Peter Parker reaching a difficult time in his life (love for MJ, Aunt May's financial problems, failing Dr. Connors' class, etc.) and having to face another villain causing him to consider what life to choose is a great idea for a story. It's such an important part of his life in the comic books that it's hard not to put it in a movie.Peter/MJ Romance: Sure Spidey had other love interests in the comics, but Mary Jane stands out on top. Their love is taken to another level as both struggle to choose between love and the lives they choose, making each of them more 3-dimensional characters. This is all very subtle.Villain: Doctor-freaking-Octopus! Considered by Stan Lee himself to be one of the greatest villains of all time, Doc Ock is finally brought to life as the tentacled terror he is. Like in the comics, he starts out as a good person and someone Peter can relate to, but fate deals a tragic hand as the nuclear physicist is fused to his artificially-intelligent mechanical arms and he sets out to finish what he started by any means necessary. Spectacularly executed and the design of his arms is excellent.Action: These are some of the best action scenes I have seen in a superhero movie. Superior to the ones from the first film, the battles between these 8-legged critters literally takes you to new heights as they practically beat the living crap out of each other. AWESOME!Effects: While the effects like the CGI of the first movie were kinda obvious, this films effects are a major improvement. It almost makes me have a tricky time telling whether something is real or a computer effect and that is impressive. It all makes the action more amazing to watch.Cast: Most of the classic characters are played by a fine cast with Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, and Alfred Molina doing excellent jobs playing their parts, even if Tobey is a little too goofy and dorky. Rosemary Harris does an even greater job here as Aunt May as she goes through a significant change in her life throughout the movie. Lastly, I absolutely enjoy J.K. Simmons as Jameson, who's just wonderfully hilarious and portrays the character perfectly.Themes: The themes are substantial. Spider-Man 2 brings another aspect of the whole great power/great responsibility, that is it is ultimately determined by how we choose to lead our lives, and this is enhanced when you're a hero or villain. This coupled with a few other themes discussed in the film brings a sense of reality to the story.Dr. Connors: Also known as the Lizard, he is my favorite Spider-man character of all time and I am so happy to see him here. LONG LIVE THE LIZARD!!! Without a doubt, this is a spectacular sequel, better than Spider-Man 1 and 3. Wanna see 8 limbs of awesome superhero fun, then this is the perfect movie for you.",8,3,4,30 January 2012
Aquaman," Behold the power of Atlantis!
","The DC Extended Universe has a spotty record to say the least: 'Man of Steel' had mixed reception, 'Batman v Superman' divided critics and fans alike, 'Suicide Squad' was an overall failure, 'Wonder Woman' brought hope, and 'Justice League' underperformed financially. It was an uphill battle from there and, thanks to James Wan (Saw, Insidious), this latest entry struck the right chords like a tidal wave.Plot: Arthur Curry/Aquaman was born a child of two worlds, his father an ordinary lighthouse keeper and his mother queen of the legendary Atlantis. Now, he must rise up to realize his destiny as the bridge between land and sea. He must journey across the world with the sexy princess Mera in order to prevent his half-brother Orm aka Ocean Master from bringing together the seven undersea kingdoms in order to wage war on the surface.Like 'Wonder Woman', this film was not bound by excessive sequel-baiting or studio intervention and instead told a complete story into itself and, boy, was the story something to behold, one of love and legacy. This film embodies everything that makes Aquaman such a grand and badass hero (he rules 2/3 of the planet after all) and added enough flair and compelling character writing to make it a phenomenal work of art. The underwater world is a splendor filled with stunning technology, fantastical creatures, wonderful colors, varied environments, and a lore worthy of this world. The music by Rupert Gregson-Williams definitely left an impression, providing the right feelings in every scene. All the actors did a terrific job portraying these larger-than-life characters, especially Jason Momoa who made me cheer, laugh, and root for him in every conflict, carrying the right balance of drama and humor. And let's not forget the actions scenes, which got me excited every time fists, water, and laser blasts fly; the Black Manta fight and the climactic undersea war had me pumped. I also gotta give creds to all the little nods to classic nautical tales and ancient mythology.Amazing doesn't even cut it for this one. By the time it was over, the audience gave an applause, something I rarely see in theaters and it's well-deserved. Just like the princess of the Amazons, the king of Atlantis revitalized my faith in the DCEU. I give this aquatic superhero venture a 9 out of 10.",9,2,4,23 December 2018
Spider-Man 3," A good film that bit off a little more than it can chew.
","Spier-man 3. Where do I even begin? Of all the Spiderman movies that have had there share of goofy and disappointing moments, this is the film that created the most fuss among the fans. While still a financial success and a fun, action-packed movie, tons of fans like myself are wondering what went wrong with Sam Raimi. Let's swing in to find out.I'll try to simplify the plot: Everything is starting to go well for Spidey. He gets the girl of his dreams (Mary Jane Watson) and everyone now loves Spidey. Well, almost everyone. A new triple threat has risen to truly test Peter Parker: Harry Osborne, having found out Peter's ID, has exposed himself to the Oz formula to become the New Goblin; Flint Marko, in a desperate quest to get the money to help his sick daughter, accidentally becomes the Sandman thanks to a molecular experiment; and finally there's the alien symbiote whose attachment to Peter Parker will lead to the rise of Venom. Spidey must confront the darkness within him in order the defeat these villains and save the ones he loves.As you can see, there's a lot going on in this film, perhaps too much. Let's talk about the villains. Now we all knew Harry would go after Spiderman thanks to Spider-man 2 and overall it was a well done part of the plot because not only is it Peter's journey into darkness and forgiveness but it's also Harry's. It's awesome seeing Harry forgive Peter and help him in the final battle (sucks that he dies though). While I still find the inclusion of Sandman questionable (nothing really personal with Spidey in the comics), he's still pretty cool. What I like is how they combined both the villainous and heroic aspects of Sandman into one (he has played hero in the comics) so what we got was a guy who's a criminal who's sympathetic and only wanted to help his poor kid. And then there's Venom. While Sam Raimi didn't want him in the film, when I heard Venom was in this, I thought that was a great idea. Let Peter face his darkness. But when Topher Grace came in, he ruined Venom. Venom was too skinny, too evil, and too selfish. In the comics, while he wanted to kill Spidey, Venom was a good guy who cares for people and to this day still plays hero. Not the case here. While he still looks cool (big teeth, long tongue, etc.), Venom was portrayed badly.Even with an overly complicated story, like bringing in Gwen Stacy, and some plot holes like how Venom knew about Sandman's daughter when they just met in the end, Spider-man 3 is still good with great action and some character development. If you want a thrill, go ahead and watch.",7,0,1,4 September 2011
Thor: Ragnarok," Fun but not quite the way I wanted to see.
","2017 was quite a year for superheroes. We've had 'Logan', 'Wonder Woman', 'Justice League', and, today's topic, 'Thor Ragnarok'. When I heard that they were working on this story, I was hyped. For those not mythology savvy, Ragnarok is the Norse doomsday, where many of the classic gods and monsters die in an epic final showdown, including the mighty Thor. Now, I knew Thor himself wouldn't die because, hey, he's a highly marketable character, but the stakes nevertheless are raised and that alone makes for a compelling reason to go into this next step on his journey. Anyway, the film's a combo of 'Avengers: Disassembled' and 'Planet Hulk', both pretty serious stories and I actually expected it to be so like 'Capt. America: Civil War' tone-wise. Then the trailers came and they had the exact opposite feel, all bright and jokey, and the actual film was exactly that.Plot: Thor is in trouble when Odin's absence leaves Asgard open to attack by the dreaded death goddess Hela, who turns out to have quite a history on Asgard he never imagined. Worse yet, he gets stuck on the planet Sakaar, ruled by the flamboyant yet ruthless Grandmaster. And so, the god of thunder must team up with his brother Loki, the disgraced Valkyrie, and the incredible Hulk to escape and save his people. As usual in the MCU, acting is spot-on and there are some nice effects, cool worlds, and great action. The highlight was the gladiator battle between Thor and Hulk, which is brutal, well-staged, and had both epic and hilarious moments (Loki's reactions were priceless). Hela stands out more than most of the MCU villains. She was pretty tough, had a nice backstory, and Cate Blanchett looked like she was having a good time with her role (plus, she rocked that outfit). Some of the other new characters were great like Valkyrie, who serves her own unique brand of badass female fighter. There's also a great cameo by another fantasy-themed superhero, who stole the show when he appeared.That all being said, I can't say I love this one. As previously stated, a story with dark origins has been made bright and comedic. Too much like it. I feared this would happen after seeing the trailers and was proven right. I did laugh a lot, but given that this is Ragnarok we're talking about, the end of Thor's home, the tone didn't sit well for me. In fact, this film tried WAY too hard to be 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. Thor felt like a different person, snarky and a bit clumsy rather than stoic and competent like he was before, losing the charm he had before. Most of the cast we've come to know and love from Thor 1 and 2 are taken out in the most undignified ways (some don't even get a line), which really irritates me to no end. We also spend so much time on the Planet Hulk part of the story that the titular conflict and its themes aren't as developed as they should have been (you can tell right from the poster), especially Hela's relationship with Thor. Plenty of things are not given proper explanation like how Hulk ended up on Sakaar and a few new characters like Korg that are shadows of their comic counterparts. The effects went into serious CGI overload, to the point where much of it is as convincing as an old video game; the film might as well have been animated.Overall, while I did get a few kicks out of 'Thor: Ragnarok', it went the wrong direction, its potential in compelling storytelling wasted. 'Iron Man 3' had its own problems and even that offered more to me than this, which is saying something. In a franchise brimming with epic stories and characters, this chapter is one of the few big duds. At least I have 'Infinity War' to look forward to.",5,6,12,5 February 2018
Pacific Rim," 2,500 tons of pure awesome. Kaiju vs Mecha!
","As a kid growing up, I used to watch Godzilla and other Japanese monsters all the time and it quickly became my passion. I also had some respect for the mecha genre like Gundam, Zoids, etc. While this is not the first time kaiju and mecha class for supremacy (examples being 'Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla' and 'Envangelion'), it has never been done on this kind of scale. What we have here is essentially a 'love letter' to those classic films and this is coming from Guillermo del Toro of all people in all his creature mastery. Ladies and gentlemen, I give to you the ultimate clash of the titans. This is Pacific Rim.Plot: Giant monsters from another dimension called Kaiju (Japanese for monster) are sent through a portal at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean to eradicate all of humanity. As normal weapons prove ineffective against the beasts, the military develops the ultimate weapon, the Jaegars, giant robots driven by two pilots built to go toe-to-toe with their reptilian rivals. While successful at first, more and more Kaijus come in stronger than their predecessors to take down the Jaegars. With options and resources being depleted, it will take a former pilot and his new partner to control a legendary Jaegar as part of a final plan to end this war of the monsters.I've been waiting to see a film like this on the big screen since 'Godzilla 2000'. First off, I love this world Guillermo has created as a lot is established to breath life into this grand world of monsters and machines. We see how people live in a time like this and how they all see this entire situation from different perspectives. Most of the characters are surprisingly likable, each having their strengths and weaknesses, and the acting isn't half bad (if not over-the-top at times). It's hard to get likable humans in a monster movie and this film does a good job with it as I generally feel for the characters as they develop unique relationships, in particular the main pilots Raleigh Becket and Mako Mori as well as their commander Stacker Pentecost.The highlight of the film is definitely the Kaijus and the Jaegars and the battles between them and it never disappoints. These are some of the best actions scenes I've seen in a film like this. Like a giant-sized wrestling match, these titans smack each other with random objects, shooting projectiles, and smash through buildings, pretty much beating the living crap out of each other and everything in sight is reduced to rubble. I like how unpredictable the battles are as the film keeps you guessing on what's going to happen next. I also love the designs of both combatants as each of them, Kaiju or Jaegar, has it's own unique design and special abilities (not to mention cool names like Red Cyclone, Leatherback, Gypsy Danger, Otachi, etc.).Overall, I was blown away by this movie. While the beginning was a little slow, it picks up the pace in the middle and ends with an epic climax. I honestly hope a sequel is made (and believe me they're planning on it) so I can see another titanic showdown between monsters and machines. If you love action, science fiction, Guillermo del Toro, or Japanese monsters, then definitely check this one out because it's worth it.",9,5,15,13 July 2013
Ant-Man," Some great superhero movies come in small packages.
","'We have so many big men fighting this war. Maybe all we need now is a little guy.' - Dr. Abraham Erskine (Captain America: The First Avenger)Never can those very words be more ironically fitting for this newest MCU entry than any other film in the series. After the huge hit that was 'Avengers: Age of Ultron', Marvel decides to take things back to basics and start Phase 3 with probably the most unlikely superhero imaginable. A great deal of skepticism surrounded this film on whether or not it would be successful, let alone be accepted by general audiences. There was also the concern of a change in directors due to conflicting views of how the story would be presented. Normally, this would cause a film to fail (prime example being the 1998 GODZILLA) but, in an unexpected twist, this film gained a positive reception and after seeing it in theaters, it's easy to understand why.Plot: Dr. Hank Pym, the first Ant Man, creates technology revolving around the miraculous 'Pym particle', a formula that allows the user to shrink to the size of an insect while still retaining incredible strength and use tech to control ants. However, fearing what this could do to the world in the wrong hands, he keeps it a secret. As a result, his bitter former protégé Darren Cross not only takes away Pym's company, but also decides to try and recreate this power in the form of the Yellowjacket suit and sell it off to some unsavory parties. Wanting to prevent a global disaster, Pym takes under his wing Scott Lang, a skilled thief who wishes to better himself for his daughter. With the help of Pym, his own distant daughter Hope, and an army of fierce ants, Scott sets out to perfect his newfound powers and steal back the technology from Darren as the new Ant Man! Similar to 'Guardians of the Galaxy', this whole idea sounds ridiculous on paper, but likewise the film is somewhat self-aware of this and just has fun with it while still making the story and drama substantial. The comedy is executed well, making me laugh multiple times, a lot of that being due to Paul Rudd's and Michael Peña's performances. The effects and actions scenes are definitely the highlight of the film. Ant Man's power to shrink brings some refreshing visuals in terms of scale and the fight scenes are very well-choreographed, especially one involving a certain Avenger. I also like how this movie uses different species of ants, already such amazing animals, and on top of that, each species has its own unique abilities to assist the hero. The climax where it's Ant Man vs Yellowjacket is definitely one of the best in MCU, with all the aforementioned aspects harmoniously coming into play.The characters are all great. Scott Lang/Ant Man is such a likable protagonist, someone who, despite losing his way from time to time, can improvise and push himself to become something more, especially for his daughter, who by the way is such an adorable kid. He can also surprisingly hold himself well in a fight and with his wit, suit, and ants to assist him, he's a force to be reckoned with. Hank Pym makes for a great mentor figure, just as witty and resourceful as Scott. In the comics, he's got lots of issues but this version presents this trait in a way that makes him heart-felt and sympathetic rather than aggravating. Hope is also a character that has some complexity to her and her relationship with her father is a great parallel to Scott and his own daughter. The villain Darren Cross/Yellowjacket is a pretty simple villain, cruel yet charismatic, but still threatening enough and having a fairly understandable motivation, not to mention that his suit packs some nasty firepower.While the film does start out a little slow, once it gets going, it's a thrill to watch. With fun characters, exciting action, hilarious comedy, great visuals, nice twists, and a few good themes, Ant Man does not disappoint in almost every way. I look forward to seeing more of the insect-themed hero in future MCU films.",8,2,8,28 July 2015
Man of Steel," The ideal Superman movie.
","Up in the sky! Is it a bird? A plane? No, it's the best Superman movie ever! Essentially created by a pair of Jewish college students in the 1930s, Superman was pretty much the very first superhero, his comics having entertained audiences around the world for decades and helped America pull through the Great Depression. He served as an inspiration for others, both in the comics and in real life, and was a member of the Justice League. The Man of Steel also starred in various television shows from cartoon shorts to the 'Smallville' series and was ever so famously brought to life by Christopher Reeves in the four live-action feature films (though the first two were big hits while the remaining two got the short end of the stick). In 2006, Bryan Singer attempted to bring back the film series with 2006's 'Superman Returns', but the film only got mixed reactions and was thus looked down upon by fans. And now we have this, the ultimate Superman film that we have wanted to see for years, Man of Steel! Now we are all familiar with the hero's back story: Kal El was sent to Earth by his parents from the dying world of Krypton where he would carry on the Kryptonian legacy by being the Earth's champion. Raised by the Kents and given the name of Clark, he eventually learns of his alien heritage and hones his incredible powers by traveling the world and helping those in need, his actions all the while being tracked by reporter Lois Lane. Just as the world begins to know Superman, an unsettling event takes place as a small army of surviving Kryptonians, led by the ruthless General Zod, arrive on the scene looking for Superman with rather hostile intentions. Can Superman protect his adopted world from his own people? I have been waiting for Superman to get this kind of treatment for a very long time and this is from Christopher Nolan of all people after his run with the other famous superhero Batman. The film maintains the core of the hero in that he's an alien immigrant with insane powers finding his place in this world by doing what is right and becoming an inspiration to others. It also takes a realistic turn in terms of how people would really react if they find out that there's an alien living among them, that is to say with shock and awe. We also see what the planet Krypton was like, from the culture to the environment to the inhabitants, before its imminent destruction.All the actors to their jobs well and I mean ALL of them. Henry Cavill does a convincing Superman and Amy Adams nails Lois Lane, not just there to be kidnapped but also taking a more active role, and Michael Shannon is great as a sinister yet somewhat sympathetic Zod (finally a foe Superman can find in years and not boring old Lex Luthor). The special effects are spectacular and well detailed, mostly CGI with a few practical effects here and there. The action scenes (oh, boy) are some of the best and most intense I have ever seen in a superhero movie and any movie in general. There's a lot of fighting between Superman and his fellow Kryptonians and virtually everything sight is utterly destroyed as if Godzilla did steroids and went on a rampage across the world. It's that awesome, nothing held back! With a stellar cast, great special effects, apocalyptic action scenes, and a very compelling story, the Man of Steel is the Superman film we have been waiting for. In fact, why are you still here reading this review? Go see this movie while you still can and prepare to be blown away.",10,0,4,25 June 2013
The Thing," A nerve-wreaking sci-fi horror classic.
","With the new prequel coming out appropriately October, 2011, I thought I'd look back at one of my favorite science fiction alien movies: The Thing. More closely resembling the novel it was based on 'Who Goes There?' than the 1950s flick which only follows the first part of the story with the scientists finding the spacecraft, John Carpenter's remake made an icon out of the terrifying shape-shifting visitor.It's a typical monster run amok, but this time none of the characters know who's real and who's a thing because the organism is able to assimilate its victims and take on their likeness. When it attacks, it rips itself apart into a bloody blob of grotesque body parts. It really draws tension between the characters, which makes it especially interesting and the concept of not knowing who's who is pretty scary. Heck, the things are pretty scary, taking on ugly forms and making that wailing scream can send chills down one's spine. Thankfully, our heroes are armed with one of my favorite weapons of all time: the flamethrower, the only effective tool against the organisms. I'm happy that the Thing is more like the book because the 1950s interpretation of the creature is not very faithful being a blood-sucking Frankenstein-like humanoid made of vegetables.With actors like Kurt Russel and Keith David and a good balance of horror, sci-fi, and mild comedy, this is an excellent movie and I look forward to seeing the 2011 prequel.",8,1,2,3 October 2011
Kung Fu Panda 2," Awesomeness times two.
","Dreamworks is at it again! 'Kung Fu Panda' was one heck of a big hit and when news of a sequel came up, I was fairly excited. Most of the same cast is back and are thrown into an adventure unlike any other. Get ready to feel the thunder because this is Kung Fu Panda 2.Po the panda is now officially the new Dragon Warrior and is currently living the dream. However, a new threat bigger than Tai Lung has emerged and threatens not only the existence of kung fu, but also all of China. That threat is Lord Shen, a deadly albino peacock (Gary Oldman) who leads an army of wolves and gorillas, has possession of a weapon the world has never seen, and shares a mysterious and traumatic link to our hero's past. Po and the Furious Five (Tigress, Monkey, Mantis, Crane, and Viper) must find a way to stop the evil Lord Shen from taking over China once and for all with all the skill and awesomeness they have.It's great to see the old gang come back like Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Lucy Lui, etc. Likewise, we have an all new group of actors coming into the fray: Gary Oldman (Lord Shen), Michelle Yeoh (Soothsayer), Jean-Claude Van Damme (Master Croc), etc. There's a lot more action going on and it's pretty intense. The jokes are still a load of fun, guaranteed to make you laugh at least a few times. The story is actually more complex and a little darker than what we're used to from these kinds of movies, with emotions from some the characters being conveyed quite well.Lord Shen has become one of my favorite movie villains of all time, being fairly complex and having a deadly combination of both brawn and brain. Being an albino peacock makes him seem like an unlikely threat, which helps to hide his sinister nature. What makes even more great is his connection with Po, which is something that is sure to shake things up a little bit and raise the stakes for our heroes.I would have liked to see characters like Master Croc have a bigger role in the plot, but there's nothing I can do. Overall, this is one of those sequels that surpasses the originals. Wonderfully done and I look forward to more sequels. Check it out. Skidoosh!",9,0,1,29 December 2011
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," A colorful web-slinging adventure into the multiverse!
","In 1962, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created Spider-man, which became a unique phenomenon within the superhero genre. From his amazing powers to his colorful cast, he has been one of the most enduring characters in Marvel's history, but why is that? This surprise animated film, 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse', answers that with its own quirky flair.Plot: Our protagonist is teenager Miles Morales, who finds himself struggling finding out what to do with his average life. Shortly after gaining powers from a radioactive spider bite, he finds his world turned upside down when he meets a disgruntled Peter Parker and several other alternate versions of the famed wall crawler. As they unite against the Kingpin and his forces to prevent the destruction of reality, he learns what it truly means to don the mask.The first thing that stands out is the animation, a unique style of CGI with a 2D aesthetic. It's all really gorgeous; heck, the scenes where Spidey swings through the city alone are breathtaking and I honestly can't think of any other film that looked this. Everyone has a design that is recognizable and able to stand out from previous incarnations (the only one I'm not fond of is Green Goblin). The film pays homage to various media and even pokes fun at a couple things (really like the jab at 'Spider-Man 3'), which is all part of the hero's appeal.The Spider Gang is very much like a web, each strand is distinct yet has a connection with the rest, physically and character-wise, and this becomes the basis of their kinship. They learn from each other and for Miles, it becomes exactly what he needs to fulfill his destiny. Miles himself is pretty relatable as we all have that stage in life where we are unsure of our place in the grand scheme of things. With both the animation and cast, the action scenes offer enough thrills and chills to satisfy practically any fan with multiple Spider-men and villains going at it left and right with different powers. For all the light-hearted humor and quips thrown into the mix, there are genuine stakes involved with both reality collapsing and a few characters dying in shocking ways. Kingpin in particular is an imposing figure with an unexpectedly sympathetic motivation that thematically connects with Spider-man. The rest of the villains have cool designs, but due to the already large cast, mostly serve as simple minions with the exception of Prowler who is both personal and scary.'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is a fun, visually-appealing animated feature that embodies the best qualities of the friendly neighborhood superhero, paying homage and innovating at the same time. I can definitely see why audiences are buzzing over this one. Two thumbs up from me!",8,0,1,6 January 2019
Van Helsing," This is, dare I say it, fang-tastic.
","Universal's greatest monsters are back, this time in a monster mash unlike any other. Stephen Sommers, director of 'The Mummy', brings a new set of rules and updates to his creatures and makes Van Helsing an awesome, well-equipped action hero. So let's spread our wings, charge up, and take a bite into this action-packed creature feature.Plot: Dracula, the Prince of Darkness, had Dr. Frankenstein create his monster for a nefarious purpose, but the vampire lord loses both the good doctor and his creation. A year later, having finished business in Paris (Mr. Hyde), monster hunter Van Helsing, alongside his genius sidekick Carl, is sent by the Knights of the Holy Order to Transylvania to kill Dracula while protecting Princess Anna from him. However, Dracula has three brides, a werewolf, and other creatures under his control. With the help of Carl, Anna, and Frankenstein's monster, Van Helsing sets out to stop this monster madness with an arsenal of crazy weapons and an attitude to match.This is a great tribute to the classic monster movies. Dracula, the Wolfman, and Frankenstein's monster have great updates, cool designs, and unique twists to their characters. Van Helsing is tough as nails and Anna is both sexy and strong. Both characters do have soft spots, especially for each other. Carl, along with many other things in this movie, is pretty darn funny. It's great the way all these characters are tied together in this crazy battle for the fate of the world.With a complex story, nice effects, fun music, good comedy, and awesome action scenes, this movie is sure to please. A must-see film. Check it out. Be sure to bring stakes, crosses, silver bullets, and fire.",8,24,40,7 November 2011
Monsters vs. Aliens," When aliens attack, monsters fight back!
","What a great slogan to a rather unexpected project from Dreamworks animation studio. I have to admit that I was thrilled by the overall concept and while it's not the first time monsters battled aliens for control of the planet, this was a nice twist and a great tribute to classic 50s creature features.Plot: Susan Murphy (Reese Witherspoon) was about to be married to the dashing reporter Derek when she was stuck by a meteorite full of an unknown but powerful energy, causing her to grow to nearly fifty feet in height. Somehow deemed a monster by the government and renamed as Ginormica, the poor girl gets locked away in a secret facility with other monstrous misfits; macho fish-ape Missing Link (Will Arnett), mad scientist Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie), indestructible and gelatinous B.O.B. (Seth Rogen), and the 350 foot grub Insectosaurus. When the evil alien Gallaxhar (Riann Wilson) attacks the earth with giant robots and an army of clones, General W.R. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland) convinces the president (Stephen Colbert) to let the monsters loose to defend the earth from this outer space menace in return for their freedom.The cast was a lot of fun as they all fit very well with their roles like Hugh Laurie as the intelligent Dr. Cockroach (reminiscent of House) and Seth Rogen as the fun-loving but dim-witted B.O.B. Reese's character Susan a.k.a. Ginormica was a great heroine (as well as easy on the eyes) and was developed surprisingly well and and Will Arnett's Missing Link was also pretty cool, plus Insectosaurus is one of the coolest and cutest monsters I've ever seen. General Monger was awesome as he's afraid of no one and takes no nonsense. Finally, Gallaxhar was a good villain and actually has typical alien characteristics (big head, tentacles, etc). Riann Wilson did a good job bringing out his delightfully despicable nature.The graphics look great right down to the finest detail, then again Dreamworks always brings out some good animation. The comedy made me laugh a good number of times as the jokes range from a little slapstick to references to classic sci-fi films. Heck, the monsters and aliens themselves are funny little parodies to those films like The Fly, The Blob, Mothra, The Day the Earth Stood Still, the list goes on. The action scenes, while not as grand as Kung Fu panda or Disney's The Incredibles, are pretty good, utilizing the abilities of each monster pretty well and bringing a sense of adventure to the movie.There are a couple of bones to pick here. One is that it seemed that the film put more emphasis on comedy then action, which kinda disappointed me, after all this is called Monsters vs Aliens so you would think that there'd be tons of action like The Incredibles. On another note, I felt that some characters where heavily underused and not able to reach their full potential, particularly Insectosaurus and General Monger.The complaints I have here are noticeable, but they don't stop me from enjoying this movie and they shouldn't bother you either. Overall, this was a fun tribute to classic science fiction and very entertaining. Definitely worth a watch, so check it out!",7,0,0,6 January 2013
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Whoever thought witch hunting could be fun!
","Witches beware because hell hath no fury like a pair of siblings out for some supernatural blood. Now, everyone pretty much knew the story of two kids who escape the wrath of a cannibal witch living in a candy house in the middle of the woods, but what happens after that is revealed in this movie: Hansel and Gretel become witch hunters. Heh, as if Red Riding Hood meeting werewolves wasn't crazy enough.So the plot goes that after years of hunting witches, the title characters come across a town and get hired by the local mayor to take of a strange matter of witches, led by the wicked grand witch Muriel, kidnapping children for a sinister purpose. As Hansel and Gretel soon learn that this is no ordinary case of a witch infestation, can a dark secret from their past prove to be their salvation or their undoing?Right from the start, the two protagonists are likable as well as very tough. They actually do act like brother and sister, having a good time while having the occasional disagreement. The weapons they use are insane and the action scenes are a load of fun, fast-paced and lots if gore and destruction. The music fits very well too, complementing a lot of the action that goes on. The witch Muriel is actually a good villain, enjoying every little evil deed she pulls off and seriously messing with our heroes. Throw in a little humor, a couple of nice twists, and excellent special effects (from the CG to the monstrous design of the witches) and you have one fun fairy tale roller coaster ride.Definitely one of the better reinterpretations of classic fairy tales out there that I have seen and worth a watch, so check it out! Just don't bring any little kids into this one.",8,25,48,27 January 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," An amazing thrill ride of webs and scales!
","This movie truly lives up to its name. The web slinger has quite a history in the world of cinema. Sam Raimi may be the first to bring the superhero to the big screen (and he did a good job...mostly), but Mark Webb pretty much perfected it. Not only did Mark bring back Peter Parker, but he gave the wall crawler a much needed makeover, especially after the disaster called Spider-Man 3. So, let's swing into The Amazing Spider-Man.The plot is excellent: We know Peter Parker is a bit of a social outcast at school and lives with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, but what about his parents? Richard and Mary Parker had to leave Peter for some ambiguous business, and disappeared for it. Years later, Peter finds his father's possessions and seeks answers, not only getting himself bit by a genetically-altered spider in the process, but also running into his father's former partner Dr. Curt Connors, who specializes in cross-species genetics. As Peter struggles with his newfound powers and a growing romance with fellow genius Gwen Stacy, Connors, through his experimentation, becomes the monstrous villain known as the Lizard. Can Spider-Man deal with the stress of being a hero and face this reptilian menace? The cast can't be any more awesome. Let's start with Spider-Man. Much as I like Tobey Maguire, he was a little too goofy and emotional. Andrew Garfield nails the character right on. As Peter Parker, he manages to make him smart and enthusiastic, but also both tragic and hilarious. As Spider-Man, he gets the whole wisecracking thing right as he makes criminals look like total idiots with his jokes. I like the way he fights as his movements are more fast and spider-like. I'm also happy to see the web shooters as they are a huge part of the comics, something Sam Raimi avoided in his movies. Nicely done.A lot of people will agree that Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is way more interesting than Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson. Not only does she have the looks, but also the attitude and sweet nature Gwen has. While Mary Jane is not portrayed entirely accurately and is always the damsel in distress (not to mention constantly balling Peter out), Gwen Stacy is more active in her role and is more cunning. She's also fairly intelligent, perhaps rivaling even Peter. Definitely a huge improvement over the older films.Doctor Curt Connors a.k.a. The Lizard is by far my favorite character in the whole franchise. Rhys Ifans did an excellent job portraying one of the most complex characters in the comics. As a man, Connors is a good man who want to help people, including himself, and he can relate to Peter quite easily for he knew the boy's father. As the Lizard, he is totally awesome. The villain is so powerful and menacing that he puts the other villains to shame. I daresay the Lizard is more threatening than a guy dressed as a goblin, not only to Spidey but also all of New York. It's so satisfying seeing the scaly fiend take a starring role after sitting on the sidelines in the original trilogy for so long. Lizard, you're the man...or...reptile! The rest of the cast is a load of fun too, like Denis Leary as George Stacy and Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben. The special effects are to behold as they are realistic to the finest detail, from Spidey swinging to Lizard's complex design. There's also a good deal of realism to the science like how can one fight crime as Spider-Man (as well as the pressures of being the hero) and how cross-species genetics (a reality by the way) works and its uses. The action scenes are without a doubt the best in the film series, having a fast pace and quite a bit of destruction as the raging wall crawlers duke it out.In conclusion, The Amazing Spider-Man is by far greater than Sam Raimi's original trilogy. With this new path Mark Webb is taking with Spidey, I look forward to any sequel coming up. This action-packed thrill ride is sure to please any fan and any newcomer to the franchise. Definitely worth the watch, so check it out!",10,4,10,8 July 2012
Aliens," Magnificent, isn't it?
","James Cameron, you really outdid yourself! I remember watching this when I was a kid many times and being frightened to death and back because of this movie. The movie 'Alien' established the groundwork for the story and gave us one of the most iconic and terrifying monsters in cinematic history. At the time, the Xenomorph seemed like an unstoppable killer, much like classic slasher villains like Jason Vorhees and Freddy Kruegar, but now not only do we multiple aliens but we also see them in actual combat with space marines. In space, no one can hear you scream...or get blown up.Ellen Ripley has been in cryogenic sleep in space for fifty-seven years, but the amount of time and distance traveled can not make her forget the horror of the creature that killed her crew. Just as she was deemed psychologically unfit to carry on her job thanks to the evil Weyland-Yutani Corp, contact was lost to the colony established on LV-426. Brought as a consultant, Ellen returns to the desolate planet with a group of tough-as-nails marines. Soon after a little girl named Newt is found as the only survivor, Ellen and the marines discover a horrifying truth: the Xenomorphs have returned and they are faster, stronger, and smarter than previously thought. Realizing that time is not on their side, our heroes must band together if they hope to escape this horror and wipe out the aliens once and for all. Otherwise, it's game over, man! First off, we have an iconic cast of characters from the leading lady Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, Michael Beihn as the level-headed Hicks, Bill Paxton as the hilarious Hudson (most of the famous lines of the movie come from him), Jennete Goldstein as the no-nonsense Vasguez, and Carrie Henn as the heartwarming Newt. Even Lance Henriksen as the android Bishop is a great character. All these guys are a delight to watch, just the way they play off each other is done very well, especially the developing bond between Ripley and Newt.The design of the Xenomorphs is done by the late Stan Winston, responsible for creature effects of films such as Terminator and Jurassic Park. Definitely the coolest look for these parasitic creatures. I also love the further exploration of the creature's biology and life style, the most iconic moment that demonstrates this is the introduction of the Alien Queen, a masterpiece of special effects at the time. The action scenes are also worth noting. They're awesome to watch, full of twists and turns, and the weapons the marines use sure put up a fantastic light show. The music is great, very memorable and sometimes very unnerving. Finally, the film utilizes suspense to its fullest, keeping you on your tones for something bad to happen and even then you may feel yourself unprepared for what pops up.I may have tiny nitpicks, but they don't spoil the fun. This is undoubtedly one of the best sequels in film history, surpassing the first film by a mile. Even to this day, many fans consider this to be the best of the franchise, to which I have to agree. It's a shame 'Alein 3' kinda ruined some things that made this one excellent. Aliens is a movie that truly stands on it's own and I doubt any crappy remake can steal the show from this sci-fi experience. Like the Xenomorphs themselves, this movie is a perfect organism.",10,0,1,9 March 2013
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Crazy, stupid, awesome video game fun.
","Scott Pilgram, a comic series unlike any other, is brought to insane life onto the big screen. When I first heard about this, I dismissed it as some lame movie, but to my surprise it isn't. This is one of the best movies with the word 'versus' in the history of cinema. It's so absolutely mind-blowing that I can't tell if the author of the comics was tripping on acid when he made this.Now on to the plot: Meet Scott Pilgram, a teenage boy who has his own rock band, been in a few relationships, lives in an apartment with a homosexual roommate, and happens to be the best fighter in town. When he meets a mysterious hair-color-changing girl named Ramona, Scott suddenly falls in love. However, to be with Ramona, he has to defeat her seven evil ex's, each with their own skills and powers, in awesome and hilarious video game style brawls to the death.All I can say is that this film is pure freaking genius. Action-packed and incredibly stupid (in a good way). I wish I had fights like these, then my life would be complete! All the evil ex's are delightfully despicable, each having their own funny little quirks. This is a wonderful movie and I recommend that you check this out.",9,46,82,30 November 2011
Alien vs. Predator," The deadliest species finally go head to head.
","Now this is a good one. After selling the famous comic book crossover for years, Fox finally decided to bring its greatest intergalactic match-up to life and into the big screen. The players here are truly formidable. One is an insectoid hive creature living a semi-parasitic life style armed with acidic blood, sharp teeth/claws/tail, and an unmatched will to survive no matter the cost. The other is a hulking, crab-faced, infrared-seeing, reptilian humanoid with advanced technology, a strict sense of honor, and a blood lust for sport.Weyland Industries (the future Weyland/Yutani Corp.) discovers a strange heat signature emanating from an ancient pyramid buried deep in Antarctica. Naturally, a team of various experts, mainly lead by Alexa Woods and Charles Bishop Weyland, go in to investigate and find a lot of intriguing things inside. However, this was all a trap. Many mechanisms inside the pyramid are activated and soon a hibernating Queen Alien spawns several offspring from the bodies of some of the explorers while three teenage Predators come in to hunt them as a manhood ritual. Can our team escape? Even so, whoever wins, we lose.Many things in this movie are pretty cool. The fights between the two species are awesome, especially the first one with the Celtic Predator vs the Alien named by the filmmakers Grid. The story is especially interesting. It is inspired by the famous book 'Chariots of the Gods' written by Erich von Däniken that explains the Astronaut Theory: early humans developed civilizations and built pyramids because they were visited by aliens who taught them these things, which I think is possible. The human characters are pretty likable too, which is hard to do when making creature features such as this. Alexa Woods, for example, is a strong-willed woman with a no-nonsense attitude and Weyland, despite his ambition to make history, does care for people.I would have liked for this movie to be rated R instead of PG-13, but that's a minor complaint. Overall, this film connects the Alien/Predator story lines pretty well and I do recommend you watch this cool crossover as well as check out the various comics that are out there.",7,2,3,8 September 2011
Avengers: Infinity War," To Infinity and beyond!
","There was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people to see if they can make the universe that nobody else would, to see if it can be more than a franchise. On that day, when Hollywood's most brilliant filmmakers came together to win box offices the way no one could. On that day, they made the MCU. All theatrics aside, this is an achievement unlike anything seen before. For ten years, we have had the pleasure of a consistently good series of films starring superheroes, many of whom were virtually unheard of or overlooked by the general public from 'Iron Man' to 'Black Panther'. Now, the hype has reached its highest point yet when the Avengers and others must band together one more time against their greatest challenge yet, the mad titan Thanos, who seeks ultimate power by collecting the Infinity Stones, which power a Gauntlet that will allow its user total mastery of the universe.Words may not be sufficient for what I experienced, but I'll do my best nonetheless (without spoilers of course). Seeing all the faces we've come to know and love come together, in some cases meeting for the first time, and playing off each other was beyond amazing, their chemistry practically flawless and well worth the wait. They also provide beautiful combos of skills and powers to the table with even minor characters like Nebula and Falcon having their moments to shine on the battlefield. The music perfectly accentuates many scenes from the epic to the tragic like Capt. America's first appearance and the comedy is top notch. Plot twists are at an all-time high here as there are many things that utterly shocked me to the core, one of which made my jaw drop. In fact, the drama is arguably as strong, if not stronger, than the action scenes with plenty of heart-wrenching moments and dialogue.So, after all the buildup, how does Thanos hold up? Enough to hold up the very heavens. Josh Brolin brings an astonishing depth to a menacing villain who is almost the protagonist in this story, his backstory and motivations making complete sense when you think about it. You also empathize with what he's going through as he is not going on his campaign unscathed, physically and emotionally. He's not doing it out of a clichÃ©d bad guy desire but out of sense of what he believes is right (different from his comic counterpart but still effective). It's funny how these movies played out as a trilogy, not just literally but in a state of being; the 1st had the spectacle in seeing these heroes come together (body), the 2nd was more philosophical (mind), and the 3rd hits you in the heart (spirit). The film ends on an open, ambiguous note, so we'll have to wait for the 4th Avengers to complete the story. Some of you should have spare underwear and be ready to empty your tear ducts for the awesomeness and tragedy to come. The tides of the MCU have changed and we must be ready for anything.",9,1,5,3 May 2018
Django Unchained," What the hell did I just see?
","Tarantino is at it again! Now, I never really saw any of this guy's movies with the exception of parts of 'Kill Bill Vol. 1', where I instantly see his style of filmmaking, long running times and gallons of blood. Then this jolly little film comes out an I expected it to be a typical Western superhero-type film, kinda like the Lone Ranger, Jonah Hex, or even Zorro. What I actually saw was not what I expected.What we have here is a standard revenge story. Django was sold as a slave and separated from his lovely wife Broomhilda only to be liberated by a lovable German bounty hunter named Doctor Schultz. Schultz, unlike most folks at the time, pretty much dislikes slavery, so naturally he frees Django in return for being partners in justice as they set out to gain enough bounty to launch a rescue mission to save Broomhilda from the tyrannical white man.This story could have been done A lot better in a shorter screen time, but Tarantino misses the mark here. First of all, so many dialog scenes dragged on for eternity. The viewer will get the point after the first few minutes of the conversations, even though there are some subtle moments here and there. Second, there was a point where the film forgets it's an action film and the level of violence that is present is greatly exaggerated, people exploding like watermelons thrown into the jaws of alligators (which is to be expected from Tarantino). I found myself bored and finding many moments to be a little silly.I will give the film credit based on two performances. Jamie Foxx did fine in my opinion, but the ones who stand out are Christoph Waltz and Samuel L. Jackson. Christoph Waltz as Doctor Schultz was a great character, full of charm and is a very sly dog when it comes to action or words. Best character in the film, though the end result near the end of the film left me disappointed. Samuel Jackson is pretty funny sometimes, often to the point where I was laughing pretty hard.Aside from the mentioned performances, I don't see why people are praising this movie. It's really stupid, slower than a turtle with iron weights on its back, and a major letdown. Not to mention, it kept using the 'n-word' so much; I have never heard such a continuous use of that word in my entire life and it really gets old very fast. I suggest you don't waste time with this film because it is SO not worth it.",4,1,5,17 April 2013
The Lion King," The Circle of Life begins again.
","With all the live-action remakes Disney has been making as of late, it seemed inevitable that 'Lion King' would be given the same treatment. Question is how do you even redo a film beloved by most, the very height of the Disney Renaissance? Jon Favreau took on the task having previously done 'The Jungle Book', though I'd hesitate to really call this live-action given that it's mostly animation.I'd be lying if I said watching this on the big screen didn't make me feel nostalgic, getting chills when scenes like 'Circle of Life' and the wildebeest stampede come around. Hans Zimmer's music is still a blast to this day. I also got some laughs out of the new jokes, including references to both the Broadway show and another Disney classic; Timon and Pumba are still pretty funny. The new cast gets credit for their vocal performances with only a few lines that felt off. Certain characters, dialogue, and moments were changed albeit minimally, occasionally to give new contexts or more believable actions such as Scar's plot to take the throne.Apart from one added scene, though, it's still the same movie, which may disappoint those expecting something truly new. Another issue is the crew's insistence on making this realistic led to a problem: most of the animals, despite their vocal inflections, lack facial expressions, making it harder to connect with them in the especially emotional scenes. It's strange given that Favreau allowed the animals in 'The Jungle Book' a wide range of expressions (heck, actual animals can be expressive from time to time). Some aspects like 'Be Prepared' and Rafiki aren't as impactful as they did in the original and, while graphically detailed, the visuals don't pop as much, particularly during song sequences where the colors are more muted.'Lion King' 2019 is a case of what I call giving a classic a new coat of paint. It looks nice, but it's still fundamentally the same thing. This left me conflicted. I still enjoy it, but at the same time I think more could've been done.",Null,3,3,9 August 2019
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," An improved version of 'Spider-Man 3'.
","I'd never thought I'd be faced with a film that I enjoy a lot and at the same time be so conflicted on it. Critically speaking, it's far from the best Spider-man movie and I can see why some would dislike this flick while simultaneously there many things I love about it and others do too. TASM 2 has become something of a anomaly in the world of superhero adaptations and saying that makes me feel strange. Why is that? Let's take a look.To get the bad out of the way and over with, the movie makes some of the same mistakes as 'Spider-Man 3', mainly having a story with tons of plot lines going on at the same time. We have Peter struggling with his relationship with his love interest, three villains showing up, the mystery regarding his parents, a conspiracy in Oscorp, etc. A few things get somewhat contrived and there's not only lots of product placement (a minor issue on my part) but also world building that feels thrown in, largely due to Sony trying to establish a cinematic universe to rival Marvel. It was clear that they wanted to do sequels to keep making money and keep the film license to Spidey. It's also something of a way to prevent copying aspects of the original trilogy like how the Daily Bugle is utilized. Also, if you're simply an action junkie, there's a large gap between two major fight scenes, so you'll have to wait quite a bit.Having said all that, why is it that I still like this movie compared to 'Spider-Man 3'? For one thing, I enjoy Peter's character and his relationships. Andrew Garfield really gets the hero, a smart wisecracker that does what he can to help others but at the same time he's conflicted about his chaotic life and how it affects everyone. I also like how he doesn't need to take his mask off a lot to express himself. His personality really shines through simply through his voice and body language, something Maguire never really achieved since much of the time he's mask-less, not that I blame him. Don't get me wrong, I like Tobey, but Garfield just nails his role. It's like Spider-man just leaped off the page. Peter and Gwen are a fantastic together, probably helped by the actors' real-life relationship. Their chemistry is irresistible and the drama between them is engaging. Heck, this is arguably the strongest part of the film and is worth seeing in that action gap I mentioned.The action scenes and SFX are great. The stakes are as high as ever given the scope of the threat the wall-crawler is faced with. The fights are well-choreographed with Spider-man and foes really beating the crap out of each other and flying everywhere. The use of slow-motion is excellent, with the viewer able to see the necessary details occurring in the environment, especially when Peter's spider sense comes into play, allowing him to see what's at stake and what needs to be done. Character designs are, for the most part, good with Spider-man's costume being by far the best I've seen on film yet. Electro is interesting, nice veiny make-up mixed with beautiful CGI currents flowing in his body and his electric powers are a visual delight. Rhino's mech suit is well-designed, looking both functional and powerful. Only Goblin's suit looks weird to me, though it's implied to be a prototype so it's passable, but his glider has a sleek and edgy look.Hans Zimmer outdid himself as the music is some of the best I've heard. There's several standout bits of OST, like Electro's techno suite with paranoid lyrics showing his insanity, Peter and Gwen's love music which is soothing and heartwarming, and Goblin's unsettling tone that raises to a thrilling battle music. Then there's Spidey's theme, which feels very grand and heroic, just what the web-slinger needs. Seriously, I could listen to this music all day.Despite there being 3 villains like last time, the film makes a wise choice of focusing on two. Jamie Foxx does a good job with his role, a geeky engineer treated like crap most of his life becoming a dangerous villain after going through a tragic accident and grave misunderstanding with his idol Spidey. Some say his turn to the dark side was rushed, but I didn't see it that way. I felt that he had enough establishment and being treated badly constantly is enough to make anyone mentally unstable. Harry Osborn/Green Goblin is also portrayed well. Dane Dehaan manages to make him sympathetic and his friendship with Peter feels genuine. When he is stricken with a strange illness, it's sad seeing him slowly turning into a monster and he is pretty creepy when he does so. As for Rhino, he doesn't get much focus as he's simply a part of Spider-man's everyday life. Fans may get disappointed by this, but hey the villain was like this in the Ultimate comics. Still, Paul Giamatti makes this relatively simple baddie enjoyable hammy.By all means, I shouldn't like TASM 2 but I do. It makes some the same mistakes as 'S-M 3' but also improves on the rest. It's hard for me to give a definitive rating because people look for different things in a movie and this has so many elements that anyone can like/dislike. While I'm happy that Spider-Man will be in the Marvel Cinematic Universe now, I'll also miss this series seeing as how it's now canceled and it's a shame because it has lots of good things like the overall story and actors. I guess the best way to sum it up is that this is a love-it-or-hate-it movie, but for me, I love it and I recommend this one over 'Spider-Man 3' to any fan or moviegoer. In the words of Stan Lee: EXCELSIOR!",Null,0,0,18 October 2015
The Nightmare Before Christmas," A timeless classic that never wears old. Thank you, Tim Burton.
","What can I say about this film that everyone else hasn't said. TNBC remains to be Tim Burton's greatest achievement and one of the best movies of all time.The story of Jack Skelington the Pumpkin King discovering Christmas but not initially getting its meaning is pure gold. This movie is full of memorable songs (the best being 'This is Halloween'), creative sets, marvelous stop-motion animation, and wonderful characters like Sally the rag doll, Zero the ghost dog, Oogie Boogie the Boogie Man, etc.Bottom line, this is a perfect movie in every sense whatsoever. Definitely recommended that it be watched during October or December to fit the genre. Tim Burton's dark vision lives on. Check it out.",10,0,1,28 September 2011
Guardians of the Galaxy," A rather unusual but fun superhero flick. 'I am Groot!'
","Frankly, I'm still a little surprised they made a movie out of this team since the Guardians are not as big as Spider-Man or the Avengers and are only just starting to gain some popularity. But, for a film that has a talking raccoon and a tree man that only says three words, this movie managed to be a great new installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a set-up to what appears to be the famous Infinity Gauntlet story arc for what may be Avengers 3. Anyway, the is Guardians of the Galaxy.Plot: Peter Jason Quill a.k.a. Star Lord is an intergalactic outlaw who finds himself in a heap of trouble when he steals an unknown object of unimaginable power from an old temple with the Kree radical Ronin the Accuser having his eyes on it. Wanted by this villain and the law (the Nova Corps) alike, this unlikely hero gains some unlikely allies to combat this threat, which consists of a skilled assassin named Gamora, a berserker out for revenge called Drax the Destroyer, Rocket the ill-tempered genetically-altered raccoon and his tree-like companion Groot. With the odds and checkered pasts stacked against them, can the Guardians of the Galaxy conquer a madman out for unlimited power? With such a bizarre concept and team, I initially wondered if people would even gravitate towards this movie, especially since the Guardians aren't as iconic as Hulk or Iron Man, but, to my surprise, it was well-received and I can see why. The story is actually pretty interesting and takes advantage of exploring this vast universe full of interesting creatures, technology, and even worlds. The action scenes are pretty awesome, well-choreographed with each character showing off his/her skills and abilities and beating the living crap out of each other. It especially gets intense during the big climax of the film with so much being at stake, on par with the final battle of 'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'. The special effects are also good, with an amazing mix of both CGI and practical effects. There's also a surprising amount of comedy, which for the most part is bound to make you laugh throughout the whole film, especially the post-credit scene which only comic book fans will get. I also gotta give creds to the music, a mix of classic 80s songs with some pretty epic original music. Now for the characters, who, by the way, are casted quite nicely. Star Lord is the kind of guy who has lost his way and needed some kind of crisis and a bunch of new friends to get him of the right path. Knowing that he has no powers, his greatest asset is arguably his wit as he can come up with the craziest idea and make it seem like he could really pull it off, that and his awesome gadgets. Gamora is sexy but also has an interesting depth to her, especially when you learn about her nice back story. Drax is fun, a guy of simple taste, a thrill for action, and a humorous lack of understanding of metaphors. Rocket Raccoon, a fan favorite, may seem like the dumbest idea for a Marvel character but his rough personality combined with his skill with guns and ships make him a delight to watch. Seriously, this little guy can threaten you and you would believe him. By far the best character, in my opinion, is Groot. He has an impressive set of powers that can give almost anyone a run for their money, but he also has a big heart (and puppy dog eyes), which leads to some of the most heart-warming moments you'll find in this film. An excellent performance from Vin Diesel.As for the villain, Ronin is the typical fanatic, but he at least has some sense of menace to him and he is a formidable enemy to the Guardians, plus his fanaticism is thankfully downplayed to an extent so he becomes more tolerable. A decent villain, though he's no Loki.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy is a refreshing entry to the superhero genre with its action, story, characters, effects, and comedy. Definitely worth a watch, especially if you're into superheroes or a good old-fashioned space adventures, so check it out. 'I am Groot.'",8,5,9,3 August 2014
Clash of the Titans," A good mythological remake that stands on its own.
","This fantasy adventure turned mythological mayhem was once the proud and final work of special effects master Ray Harryhausen. His work on the original film left such an impression on the world that it can be safe to say that it was one of the greatest old fantasy films ever made, mainly through the creatures Ray portrayed such as Medusa and the Kraken. To me, it was kinda a surprised that it has been remade, so naturally, being a fan of Ray, I checked this action out. Does it live up to the original classic? To me, it basically does.Many elements from the original film are still around such as most of the creatures and the basic story. With remakes, there's always new elements besides updated special effects, namely new characters and the direction the filmmakers went with this one. The new characters are sorta hit and miss, many of them are pretty interesting and sometimes humorous while a few others not so much. One new character whose performance I really enjoyed was Hades, God of the Underworld. He's so creepy, complex, and awesome that while humanity mocks the gods, he puts them in their place. Nice! Sam Worthington's portrayal of Persius is nicely done as he does as much as he can without much help to prove that he's more man than god, though this somewhat stubborn outlook does backfire on him a little, making things a little more interesting. Plus, Liam Neeson makes a great Zeus.Now for the creatures, which are a big part of the story. I like how they made Pegasus black instead of the traditional white, making the flying horse a bit more eye-catching. The scorpions are noticeably bigger and badder than back in the old movie and they have a more prominent role. Medusa is absolutely great as while she has the same basic look as before, her improved design combines both her once great beauty with her serpentine lethality. This makes her both sexy and deadly. The Kraken is by far the most awesome as not only does he look cool, but he is also a terrifying and destructive force of nature, which is enough for the gods to we themselves with fear. The rest of the creatures are good in my book.Other aspects of the movie, like the action scenes and music, are great to behold. There are some things to nitpick like certain characters that are either a little bland or annoying as well as are particular bits of dialog. Overall, a remake that's nicely done and may actually be better than the original. Worth a watch so check it out. RELEASE THE KRAKEN!",7,0,1,9 April 2012
The Dark Knight," The Caped Crusader's greatest adventure.
","What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said. It's the best Batman movie ever. Christopher Nolan took one of the greatest comic book heroes and put him through epic adult dilemmas set up by the clown prince of crime.Things are turning out well. Batman, having allied himself with Gordan and the newly-elected district attorney Harvey Dent, has Gotham City's worst criminals on the ropes. However, a new player comes to town who plays by his own rules (that is to say no rules whatsoever): the insane anarchistic archenemy of Batman, the Joker. With this psychopath spreading anarchy all around, the Dark Knight must bring a halt to this crazy clown before all goes down to complete and udder chaos.This movie is truly a cinematic masterpiece. All the performances are done so well, especially Heath Ledger as Joker. He is extremely funny while surprisingly pretty scary. His point of view in life is sickening yet you can't help but feel that he's somewhat right about a lot of things about humanity. The action scenes are a major improvement over the last film's shaky cam and extreme close-ups, punching and explosions all the time. Batman's new costume is cool too. Harvey Dent's character development into Two-Face is done very well with some nice twists to it.A long running time, the death of a certain main character, and Christian Bale's growly voice are what keep this movie from being perfect. Nonetheless, this is still an excellent movie from now and into the future. I look forward to the sequel 'The Dark Knight Rises' with Bane and Catwoman. So sit back and marvel the cinematic gold that is The Dark Knight. Avoid any pencils. They can kill in the blink of an eye! Hahahahaha!",9,0,2,22 October 2011
Avatar," Phenomenal. Absolutely phenomenal.
","James Cameron sure has a way of telling us that he's still got it. Well known for great films like Aliens and the first two Terminator movies, James put his filmmaking skills to the ultimate test and what we got was a true masterpiece. He created a film that basically combined various movie genres like war movie, creature feature, underdog story, and romance into one stable and magnificent film. Let's take a look and the cinematic wonder that is Avatar.The hero of this story is paralyzed soldier Jake Sully (Sam Worthington). He's brought to the planet Pandora, beautiful but dangerous world inhabited by strange creatures and a race of tall, blue humanoids with feline-like features called Na'vi. Jake is summoned to take part on a special project created by Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) known as the Avatar project, where he can transfer his mind through a machine into a specially grown Na'vi body so he and the scientist can interact and convince the local Na'vi population to move to another location because their home is on top of a deposit full of a precious rocky material. As expected, Jake grows to care for the aliens and falls in love with Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), the chief's daughter, and soon his loyalties will be tested as a great battle will come over the horizon.This who film is a stroke of genius, even if the plot is somewhat predictable. Such a story does have plenty of sad moments like when the Na'vi lose their home and certain characters die, but it's nice to see the good guys and creatures kicking butt and many scenes involving the wildlife of Pandora are spectacular. Sigourney Weaver is still pretty attractive and the romance between Jake and Neytiri is rather interesting and well developed. The villains are hateable right from the start (in a good way) like Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and I enjoy seeing them suffer and die in the final fight. As for the animals, they are amazing like these hammerhead rhino creatures or the Turok, a huge pterodactyl-like creature that reminds me of Rodan.Bottom line, Avatar is worth every penny and I look forward to any sequel coming up. Go visit the world of Pandora and enjoy.",9,1,3,8 September 2011
Thor," This movie will make you feel its thunder.
","Thor. He's one of the most powerful and famous super heroes in the history of Marvel comics. It is said that super heroes are basically modern day interpretations of ancient mythology. Thor is unique becomes he comes almost straight out of mythology and has since left an impact on the world, especially with his involvement with the Avengers, so the movie has quite a bit to live up to. Thankfully, it fails to disappoint. How so? Let's take a look.Long ago, Odin the ruler of Asgard defeated the Frost Giants, led by their king Laufey, who tried to take over Earth (or Midgard as they call it). He later has two sons, Thor the god of thunder and Loki the god of mischief, and they soon grow up to be great Asgardians. But when Thor's arrogance as left Asgard on the brink of war with the Frost Giants, his father Odin banishes him to Earth where he develops a bond with a few local scientists, especially Jane Foster. When Odin enters his so called Odin Sleep and the cunning Loki takes over, Thor must prove himself worthy of the title hero in order to save both Asgard and the Earth.The execution of this film is excellent. Thor lives up to his reputation as a warrior as the the action scenes are pretty awesome and the forces of good and evil go about beating each other up back and forth. There are a lot of cool moments throughout the action like when Thor rallies some lightning. Equally great is his interactions in the modern world which is just full of hilarious moments. I also love the other elements of the film like the SHIELD agents and a familiar-looking hero that make further connections to the upcoming Avengers movie.The other characters are a load of fun to. Anthony Hopkins is perfectly cast as the wise and all-powerful Odin, living up to practically every single quality of the character. Sif and the Warriors Three (Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun) are great supporting characters and so are the scientists like love interest Jane Foster played by Natalie Portman. This film's version of Loki is very interesting as he is surprisingly complex. While his villainous acts make him truly despicable, you really do feel sorry for him for he does have some decent qualities, which really moved me a little. The other villains are cool too, Laufey being cool and threatening and the Destroyer Armor being awesome and powerful as hell.I give this movie a thunderous applause. Extremely well done, though I would have like for the final battle to be a little longer. I give this movie an electrifying 8 for entertainment value and an extra point for all the subtleties throughout the film. This movie is worth every penny, so check it out.",9,0,0,26 March 2012
The Shape of Water," An unconventional beauty.
","Among my favorite directors is Guillermo del Toro. The guy has one of the most unique artistic and cinematic visions in the world of film. His inspiration to become a filmmaker was 'Creature from the Black Lagoon' of all things. Del Toro's love the Gill Man translated to his passion for monsters, though he felt sad that the famed amphibian never got a happy ending. Initially, he was brought in by Universal to remake it, but that deal went south, so he decided to more-or-less tell his own version of the story, adding a new spin that surprisingly won over both audiences and awards. That, folks, is 'The Shape of Water', a movie I've wanted to see since its inception. Plot: In this variation of beauty and the beast, a mute janitor named Eliza (Sally Hawkins), who works in a government facility, meets the Asset (Doug Jones), a fish-like humanoid from South America, and the two form an unconventional relationship. With the Asset under threat of death and subsequent vivisection by the unstable Col. Strickland (Michael Shannon), Eliza will go to great lengths to ensure the creature's survival and happiness, but will she succeed in a world so unwilling to accept that which is different?This is, indeed, a masterpiece. The Asset is an amazing character with a stellar design and a performance that feels believable (animal yet human-like). Props to Jones and the effects team for making the suit and facial expressions work with flying colors. Sally Hawkins gets high marks from her own performance, a mix of sign language and heartstring-pulling facial expressions. The pair work well together as much as their characters. The rest of the cast did very well too from Shannon's execution of a threatening villain who feels unfulfilled (a product of the era) to Octavia Spencer's humorous inflections to sympathetic portrayals by Richard Jenkins and Michael Stuhlbarg. There is also much needed credit to the world itself. It replicates the time of which the story is set in very well with many great uses of color, music, and an assortment of objects that are relics by today's standards. The best part of it all is that a majority is physically built with not much in the way of CGI save for backgrounds and a few other aesthetics. Color is also used to convey mood or symbolize a character's status (physical or emotional) and water, as the title implies, is very prominent and more or less serves both a physical and symbolic purpose as well. What little lore that exists in this world intrigues me to no end with many open-ended questions, especially in regards to the fish man. As the film is set in the 1960s, themes of racism/sexism, Cold War tensions, minor religious references, and the classic question of what separates man from monster are explored, all done with superb execution in this case. Heck, the Asset is ideal in that he can represent just about any group that suffers unjust oppression.Fair warning that, unlike Disney's 'Beauty and the Beast', this is not for children. There is a little blood + gore, language, and sex/nudity (especially one controversial scene involving the latter in a bathroom). All in all, 'The Shape of Water' is, like the abnormal pair, a thing of beauty, one that I imagine will be marveled for generations to come.",9,49,92,15 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A grand finale and a new beginning.
","The prequel trilogy had a rather rocky start with episode one with some elements that didn't fit that well with us Star Wars fans like Jar Jar Binks. Then things got improved with episode two with grander action scenes and better character development. Now the time has come for the Empire to rise as the Jedi face their greatest challenge yet from General Grievous, Emperor Palpatine, and the most shocking of all (though not shocking to us) Darth Vader.With the Clone Wars coming to a close and the cyborg General Grievous the last big villain to take down, things should look good with the Republic, right? Wrong! Palpatine a.k.a. Darth Sidius had it all set up to make his big move and have the poor and desperate Anakin Skywalker as his new apprentice Darth Vader. See the grand finale as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, and others try to stop the Sith once and for all.From beginning to end, this movie is both awesome and really tragic. The action scenes are intense and the villains General Grievous and Darth Sidius are a load of fun. Their are some sad moments too, which are pretty messed up and they slightly bother me. Music is also pretty good and it complements the mood of many scenes in this film.My only real problem with this movie as well as the entire prequel trilogy is Anakin. Sure, his transformation into Darth Vader is vital for the storyline but I didn't like that he's such a whiny and impatient little brat. I only liked him when was actually Darth Vader with the suit.Overall, this movie has POWER!!! Finely done and now we can all see how the fourth movie is titled 'A New Hope.' Definitely one of the best in the series. Check this great flick out and may the Force be with you. Always.",8,2,4,12 December 2011
Sherlock Holmes," Before Batman, there was Sherlock Holmes.
","Most people often dismiss Sherlock as a boring detective who speaks in rather complex sentences. Supposedly, that's not exactly how he is in the books as this film demonstrates. The filmmakers apparently revealed the detective's true colors as a hard hitting, resourceful, and deductive individual.Plot: Sherlock and his sidekick Dr. Watson find themselves on the trail of one of their toughest foes yet: Lord Blackwood. Blackwood claims that he has powers beyond human understanding and has plans that will shake the foundations of the world, but the undaunted Sherlock Holmes remains ever so persistent and will give any one of Blackwood's thugs that stand in his way a thorough beat down as he solves the unsolvable.Sherlock is like Batman in so many ways. He has a reliable sidekick (Watson, like Robin), he's skilled in hand-to-hand combat, he uses tools, and he analyzes things to the smallest detail. He does have his own unique twists, being manipulative and being slightly egotistical, which makes him very humorous. In fact, a lot of scenes that he shares with Watson tend to be pretty funny. The action scenes are awesome, often employing slow-motion and clever camera work. The mystery that surrounds Blackwood really messes with your mind and it makes you interested in how all this is done and what are the relations.Amazingly well done, this film is sure to entertain and beyond. Check it out.",9,1,2,31 October 2011
Arrival," A nuanced dive into the unknown.
","One of the great things about science-fiction is its ability to take a look at some aspect of reality to a heightened extent, keeping things grounded while at the same time entertaining. I came across such a thing in the form of the 2016 film 'Arrival' starring Amy Adams. Based on a 1998 short story 'Story of Your Life' by Ted Chiang, it revolves around linguist Louise Banks (Adams), who is brought before one of twelve strange alien vessels and its equally bizarre occupants with the task of decoding their language in order ask one important question: What is their purpose for coming to Earth? Though small, the cast does a fantastic job portraying characters that are mostly nuanced and relatable. Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner especially have great chemistry as they go along this journey of understanding their new visitors, who sport designs and presence that can be best described as, appropriately, 'alien'. The way the creatures communicate is also unique, allowing them to stand out more from your garden-variety extraterrestrials, and the mystery surrounding them is really engaging. The film also pretty much sums up how the world as a whole would react to a situation like this, that is to say going absolutely apes***. In a way, 'Arrival' is the perfect blend of simplicity and complexity, the basic ideas easy to understand and the details, once understood, enhance the story. The movie challenges you into questioning your place in the universe and how one can contribute to it despite insurmountable odds. In terms of pure sci-fi storytelling, this definitely ranks high on my list.",7,0,2,14 April 2018
Prometheus," A good, albeit somewhat confused, film.
","In space, no one can here you scream. Those are the words of horror brought to life with the release of one of the biggest scare-fests in America. Ridley Scott made movie history with his sci-fi horror classic simply titled 'Alien.' Now, he comes back to the Alien/Predator universe with an interestingly different angle. This caused a great deal of suspense among the fans and we just couldn't wait to see it. Was it all worth it? Plot: Scientists have discovered that cultures around the world have one unique symbol and a unique cave painting with interstellar directions, which leads to one explanation: we have been visited by extraterrestrials and they seem to want us to find them. So naturally an expedition funded by the infamous Weyland Yutani Corporation sets out and soon finds the aliens' craft. However, as they search through the craft, the team finds that something horrible has awakened.This movie definitely has the atmosphere and tone of the original Alien, which is great. Also returning is the classic design of the ship and its environment established by surreal visionist H.R. Giger. Some of the human characters have some rather interesting qualities and a good deal of complexity to them. The most fascinating character is the android David (Michael Fassbender), as he is quite curious in human motives and traits as well as how the alien craft plays into all this. The fear level of the film is substantial and the creatures definitely have a unique and creepy look to them.There are some questionable things going on here though. That same direction Ridley Scott took to bring something new to the table left me a little concerned. It seemed to me Ridley did not pay much attention to some details established by the previous Alien/Predator films, which leads to some fairly noticeable plot holes with the franchise. On top of that, there were still a lot of questions that weren't answered by the time the film ended. On a small note, there were one or two things that seemed a little pointless or rushed and a couple of human characters are either stupid or didn't contribute much to the plot.Now, on its own, Prometheus is a good movie and has a great deal of potential. However, with this new direction Ridley Scott is going with, he seems to contradict what he had created long ago. Still, it's worth a good watch and has a nice twist at the end, so check it out.",6,0,6,10 July 2012
Wonder Woman," Truly a wonder to behold.
","I was starting to have my doubts about the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). 'Man of Steel' was a nice enough movie that, like Superman, struggled to find its place, 'Batman v Superman' was a polarizing flick that was too ambitious for its own good, and 'Suicide Squad' was an entertaining film that lacked cohesion. Then along came 'Wonder Woman', which I can confidently say restored my faith. For a character that started as an icon of feminism and is a member of the Trinity, it's shocking how long it took for the heroine to grace the big screen (with only a 70s live-action series and a 2009 animated solo film to speak of) without any involvement with the Justice League; personally, I blame DC's over-reliance on Batman and Superman and bad experience with female superhero movies (*cough* Catwoman).Plot: Diana is the princess of the Amazons who has lived in peace on the hidden island of Themyscira until soldier Steve Trevor crash lands and tells of World War 1. Unwilling to let innocents suffer and suspecting powers greater than man at work, she goes with Steve to fight evil, but as she does she learns what lies beyond her home and what dwells within all of humanity.From beginning to end I was impressed. The film understands the core of Wonder Woman's character and what she represents, the potential for greatness in all of us in the face of adversity. Gal Gadot nails it, not only being bad-ass, but also bringing much needed depth and charm to her role. I can't help but smile at her innocent and well-meaning view of the world. Chris Pine was perfectly cast as Steve Trevor as well; just seems like a role he was born to play. The two share a very believable chemistry the way they play off each other such as their questions of how their respective worlds work and what do they know about life. The rest of the cast holds up well, offering some nice dynamics and even a humorous moment here and there. In fact, none of the comedy feels forced like in 'Suicide Squad', feeling more natural especially given the time period. The story has this interesting shift in its tone and color throughout, starting from the beauty and innocence of Themyscira to the dreary ugliness of the outside world to the hopefulness of the future. Diana's journey reflects this as well, developing in the best way possible into the hero she was meant to be. It's clear that the writers and director knew exactly what they were doing and I give them props.The action scenes are a great spectacle, especially with the now iconic Wonder Woman theme playing in the background adding to the excitement, with lots of good choreography involving a mix of classic fantasy combat and modern warfare. Even better is that they each serve their purpose in the story rather than being there just for the hell of it. There are some surprising twists I didn't see coming, especially when it came to the villains (who are grim reflections of the real world and each entertaining in their own right), and moments that are both heartwarming and heartbreaking.As of yet, I can't think of anything negative about the film unlike the other ones. As of yet, this is the best DCEU film ever made and it gave me more investment in seeing more to come. Go ahead and see 'Wonder Woman', but don't expect any after-credit scene.",8,4,10,17 June 2017
X-Men: First Class," Probably the best X-Men movie ever made.
","There's quite a history to the X-Men, even before the movies came out. From the beginning, the iconic mutant team created by the likes of Stan Lee represented the outcasts and rebels that suffer the persecution of 'normal' people. As the movie adaptations progressed, the antics go higher and higher, more of the famous mutant characters are introduced, and the popularity of actors such as Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Patrick Steward, etc. increased among fans. For this special prequel, we see literally the old days when Professor X and Magneto were the best of friends.Now to the plot: It's the 1960s, during the infamous Cold War tension, where a young Charles Xavier and Mystique are recruited by the likes of CIA agent Moira MacTaggert to help stop the evil Hellfire Club from starting WW3 so only mutants can rule the world. The club consists of Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), Emma Frost, Azazel, Riptide, and later Angel Salvadore. Along the way, Charles encounters and befriends Erik Lensherr a.k.a. Magneto, who seeks revenge on Sebastian for killing his mother back in WW2. With the imminent threat on its way, Charles and Erik gather more mutants to help save the world: Havok, Banshee, Darwin, and Beast. It's time to take a stand.I didn't expect mush from this film when I first heard about it due to the abundance of X-Men movies out there; I though this one would just blend in with the crowd, but thankfully I was wrong. First Class is just full of cool effects, a nice story, great action scenes, and excellent character development (especially the Charles/Erik friendship and Mystique/Beast romance). There were nice jokes like when the Professor and Magneto actually find Wolverine in a bar to recruit him and he just plain tells them off.There weren't that many problems with this film, although one noticeable problem was how little Darwin did and how he was killed off fairly early. Such mutant potential was just wasted. The final fight also could have used just be a little longer but that's a minor complaint. I also felt that Magneto became his classic evil self a little too early but that's a minor one too. The biggest complaint I have is the film's biggest blooper: Charles gets paralyzed by a bullet in the end and in the previous X-Men movies you see an older Charles in a few flashbacks clearly walking! Someone didn't pay attention. Not to mention he was friends with Magneto at the time too.Okay, bottom line, this is still a great movie. They should fix the problems mentioned above in the next movie. They should use Apocalypse in the next movie. That would be awesome! And maybe they can bring in Sinister too. If you want some good old mutant superhero fun, then check this baby out.",8,0,2,11 September 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Batman's darkest night!
","After being brought to life by dark visionist Tim Burton and then cheesed up by Joel Schumacher, the Caped Crusader was given a more serious and realistic makeover by none other than Christopher Nolan and was turned into a cinematic icon once more. 'Batman Begins' established the groundwork, going into detail of the hero's origin story, giving him lethal villains (Ras al Ghul and Scarecrow), had a theme on fear, and demonstrating how his technology can actually work in the real world. Next came the ever awesome sequel 'The Dark Knight', which continued the story, raised the stakes, had a theme on chaos, and, of course, gave us the best Joker ever. Now, the time has come for the Batman to return in 'The Dark Knight Rises.' Plot: It has been eight years since the Joker terrorized Gotham City and fallen district attorney Harvey Dent (Two-Face) died. Taking the fall for Dent's crimes, Bruce Wayne has now retired and lives in relative seclusion while Gotham moves on practically free of crime. But this will be a fleeting peace as a new foe has come to eclipse the city under his shadow: Bane. When Bane threatens to destroy Gotham, Batman must rise again to protect the people that no longer tolerates him. Will the Dark Knight succeed? Will Bane triumph? And how does the newly arrived Catwoman play into all this? Tune in to find out, same bat time, same bat channel! While I wasn't as hyped for this one as I was for 'The Avengers' and 'The Amazing Spider-Man', I was indeed looking forward to this epic film and how it all supposedly ends. It's great to see most of the original cast like Michael Caine as the wise Alfred, Morgan Freeman as the humorous Lucius Fox, and Gary Oldman as the ever reliable Gordan. Likewise, I felt that the new characters were quite interesting, each playing a key role and having fascinating personal qualities.Before the film's release, I was wondering which villain will Nolan use for this entry in this current trilogy. Believe it or not, I was actually expecting Riddler, though I was equally surprised that they considered Killer Croc. Finally, when I learned that they were using Bane, I thought that was a great idea. Previously starring (and being inaccurately portrayed) in Schumacher's 'Batman and Robin', Bane takes up the role of the main baddie and Tom Hardy does a good job playing as him. The guy is just brutal and has a menacing quality to him, despite looking like Scorpion from Mortal Kombat. I had mixed feelings about his voice, sometimes it sounds good and other ties not so much. Cool as he is, Bane is not as interesting as Joker as the clown was more devious, dangerous, unpredictable, and charming.Anne Hathaway was a real surprise to me. Before seeing the film, she seemed to me as just a simple beauty, but I took that back after seeing her in action. Not only does she look really sexy in that outfit, but her portrayal of the feline thief is nailed right off the bat (pun intended). She has proved to be very clever and tough in a fight and her relationship with Batman is quite unique. Catwoman, like in the comics, is also very complex as she is conflicted with what she believes is right. This all very subtle and I love it.The other new characters are somewhat hit-or-miss, though I did like the cop John Blake and the surprises he brings. The action scenes are awesome as the stakes are raised and Batman brings in some cool new toys. Batman's battles with Bane and Catwoman's own fight scenes are a real treat and are sure to please you as well. The story is also done well as certain details reveal the whole story, especially details established in the previous films. While I still prefer 'The Dark Knight', this is a worthy successor to the franchise, despite the fact that it didn't wow me as expected and there being a few things to nitpick. Overall, an excellent superhero movie, so check it out.",8,1,4,29 July 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A miraculous beautiful disaster.
","'Black and blue. God versus man. Day versus night. Son of Krypton versus Bat of Gotham'. Amongst the plethora of superhero films, BvS definitely stands out as, much like the titular characters, it has many conflicting sides. It's a fan's dream and a critic's nightmare, a visual wonder yet a narrative mess. The build-up to this film's release was insane with all sorts of marketing thrown everywhere. To be fair, this is two of the biggest superheroes meeting on the big screen for the first time as well, so naturally there was excitement in the air. Furthermore, it is a sequel to 'Man of Steel' as well as a major expansion on what is now called the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). So, with all this in mind, did BvS live up to the hype? Eh, let's take a look.Plot: Over a year after the battle for Metropolis, Superman continues to save the day as usual, but events are unfolding that are making humanity question the actions of their newfound alien savior. Batman in particular has become concerned that the Kryptonian is too much of a threat to the Earth, so he takes it upon himself to eliminate him, bringing the two into conflict. Meanwhile, Lex Luthor seeks to bring his sinister plans into fruition.Let's start with the good: The actors give solid performances. Ben Affleck especially defied all expectations despite all the controversy surrounding his casting, a worthy successor to Christian Bale. Henry Cavill does fine as Superman, Gal Gadot (another controversial choice) did a nice job as Wonder Woman, and Jeremy Irons is solid as Alfred (the best performance in BvS). The others like Amy Adams (Lois Lane) are fine, but I'll tackle on Jesse Eisenberg later. The special effects, though largely dominated by CGI, are visually appealing (a natural talent for director Zack Snyder) with several iconic comic moments brought to life in stunning fashion and the action scenes are of a higher quality with some great choreography (a fight scene involving Batman in a warehouse is arguably the best one). The title fight, while not as epic as the Zod battle in the last film in my opinion, does offer enough enjoyment to go around with plenty of cool moments. The climax involving the Trinity is also a thrill to watch. BvS is also blessed to have Hans Zimmer create the music, which is something that is a true pleasure for the ears alone. The film central theme is man's relationship with God, which is an interesting angle to tackle with Superman even if it's on the nose at times.Now to the dark side of the coin: The overall story is not told competently. There are many contrivances, characters do illogical things, and the plot holes are quite big. It's also pretty clear that DC and WB wanted to compete with Marvel that they threw in so much stuff from the comics without any true cohesion. There's one scene involving cameos in an email done right in the middle of the film, stopping it dead just for fanservice and sequel baiting. If this was done via post-credit scene, it'd be fine, but since that's not the case, it's a nagging distraction. In fact, there's so much sequel baiting it takes up a large chunk of the film, which Marvel did well to avoid in most of their films. There are dream sequences that are not used or explained properly, the ultimate reason for Batman and Superman to fight is so easily avoidable yet the writing demands they fight anyway, and plot elements from specific comics are used without any true understanding of what made those elements work in the first place. The film's dark, gritty tone is distracting at times, fitting for Batman but not so much for Superman. There's also a major Superman character that's killed off just because Snyder couldn't figure out what to do with him in the DCEU (which he laughed at).Let's talk about the elephant in the room: Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor (technically Lex Jr. but whatever). Talk about a serious miscast. Now, Jesse is a good actor but the material he's given conflicts with a film trying so hard to be taken seriously. Lex is very over-the-top, which, while amusing at times, is too much like the Joker or Jim Carrey's Riddler. He seems to miraculously know things with no explanation whatsoever and feels pretentious to the point of utter hypocrisy. His motivation, though given a brief explanation, is weak beyond compare and his plans are not only questionable but also have more holes than a screen door.Rarely have I been truly conflicted with a film. For every good thing BvS offers, there's a bad one to counter it. It's a true stalemate of cinematic wonder and blunder that I can't give a definitive rating. This conundrum of cool and calamity has two versions: theatrical and extended. The theatrical cut has better pacing and gets to the point more quickly, but suffers some bad editing and leaves out vital details. The extended cut, with 30 minutes of extra footage, thankfully clears up many inconsistencies and fleshes out some characters + story elements but you feel that half hour. I'd say BvS is still worth a watch, but your individual expectations may give you different conclusions about it.",Null,0,3,25 April 2017
Godzilla," All hail the return of the King!
","Next to King Kong, Godzilla is arguably the most iconic monster of all time, spawning entire generations of kaiju films from Mothra to Rodan. My history (and love) with this franchise dates all the way back to my childhood, becoming something of a passion, and since I have grown I have come to appreciate what Godzilla and his fellow kaiju stood for, as forces of nature meant to remind humans that we are not as superior a species as we like to think of ourselves. At the same time, the kaiju themselves have demonstrated what it means to be human, showing emotions and character not typically seen in general American monsters. In 1998, Roland Emmerich failed miserably at his attempt to make his creature Zilla pass as the King of the Monsters. For sixteen years we have had to live with this outrage, but now newcomer director Gareth Edwards takes center stage with his re-imagining of Godzilla. It was worth the wait! Plot: In 1999, nuclear physicist Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) saw the death of his wife due to a strange tremor in the nuclear plant they worked in. Fifteen years later, Joe realizes that this was no natural disaster and goes looking for answers. He and his distant son Lieutenant Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) soon discover that man's arrogance has unleashed ancient, malevolent beasts called Mutos just as it had decades ago. With everyone's lives at stake, including Ford's wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen), the military attempts to contain and eliminate the threat, but Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) believes only one thing can stop the malevolent Mutos, something just as ancient and equally terrifying. Nature has a power to restore balance and that power is in the form of the giant reptilian monster known as Godzilla. But, is Godzilla a friend or foe to humanity? Who will survive in the war of the monsters? Since 'Godzilla 2000', I have waited fourteen years to see another Godzilla movie in the theatres and my wish was granted, fan-boy joy and all. Gareth Edwards made sure not only to deliver great kaiju action and special effects, but also a well-written story with compelling human characters and good themes just as the original film 'Gojira' had done.The human element of this reboot is exceptionally well-done, with notable performances done by Bryan Cranston brilliantly delivering the tragic nature Joe Brody and Ken Watanabe bringing the insightful wisdom of Dr. Serizawa (a fitting reinterpretation of the original character). Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen do alright in their parts as a married couple trying to pull through in helping others at a time of crisis. A few other characters play there parts well enough at different points of the story. I like how some of the humans don't just sit by and do nothing, they really do their best to play their part, particularly Ford Brody.There's some darn good kaiju here as well. Godzilla is presented as he should be, like an angry god who will stop at nothing until his enemies are destroyed and balance restored. There was a great deal of build-up to his grand reveal and when he shows up, it's all worth it. His design was awesome, sticking close to the classic look but updating it for today's standards (take note of this, Emmerich!). Some may question a few design choices here and there, but when one thinks about it they all make biological sense, bringing some realism to a gigantic radioactive dinosaur. Big G's roar was a nice sound effect, loud and pretty scary. Granted, Godzilla should have had more screen-time in the film, but I was at least satisfied. In the other corner, we have the Mutos, who are great additions to Godzilla's rogues gallery. They have a unique design that makes them look quite alien but still having traits that make them seem like real-life animals. Both kaiju are terrifying monsters, but Gareth Edwards made sure that they all have a sense of emotion and character, to which he succeeds, making us fear them but also empathize with them.There are other elements that also make this film great. The suspense in the first half of the film is done almost perfectly, leaving you in anticipation for the arrival of the kaiju and the action in the second half. The music befits the dark tone of the movie, especially the surprisingly-catchy main theme which has a truly foreboding mood. The action scenes are excellent, shot with superb cinematography giving the sense of scale (important for creatures as big as these) and bringing increasingly great thrills. The battles between Godzilla and the Mutos are especially awesome to watch, smashing everything in their path as they brutally tear each other apart like savage animals. All of this is achieved with special effects that would impress even the greatest of filmmakers.With a stellar cast, impressive special effects, spectacular kaiju, ominous music, impressive action scenes, and a few nice themes, Gareth Edwards has created an American reboot that is worthy of the license. Godzilla's creator, Tomoyuki Tanaka, would be so proud. Pacific Rim may have brought back people's interest in the genre, but Godzilla has officially cemented the fact that giant monsters are making a comeback (heck, Gamera is said to be coming back next year). It is SO GREAT to see the King of the Monsters grace the big screen once again and I look forward to seeing him in more. Sure, this movie does have a few flaws, but I would strongly recommend you check this action out.",8,2,6,18 May 2014
300," More like negative 300.
","Like so many movies now, this one is based on the comic book of the same name. The story likewise is based on an actual event during the Persian War with three hundred Spartans facing a massive Persian army at a relatively thin passage (a brilliant strategic move if you ask me), fighting the enemy little by little. That sounds like a spectacular story and would be even cooler to see it in film. Is it worth it? Not really! Granted it does have some nice action scenes, a gritty look, and some good slow motion moments, but the overall quality of 300 is just...weird. There's just so many bizarre things in this movie that it kinda bothers me, especially the way the portrayed the Persians. They look unnatural, the king in particular with his body covered with rings. The Spartans have some problems of their own as they talk like cavemen, they wear nothing but capes and thongs (not exactly what they wore in real life by the way), and they seemed far fewer than 300 strong. Jeez, what were the filmmakers smoking when they made this crap? I would not recommend this to anyone, and I mean anyone! This crap doesn't exactly deserve the praise it got, so it might as well belong in the trash. Viewers, tonight this movie burns in hell!",4,4,6,21 April 2012
Fantastic Four," Time to flame on and clobber.
","On of the first super hero teams to exist, the Fantastic Four had reached stardom throughout the years, so naturally a movie adaptation is inevitable. Roger Corman made his version in 1994, but it never had a theatrical release. This one is the film we're all familiar with. So let's flame on and take a look at this, dare I say it, 'fantastic' film.We all know the plot: Four scientists get exposed to cosmic radiation and wind up getting super powers, thus becoming Mr. Fantastic, The Invisible Woman, The Human Torch, and The Thing. While trying to get use to their newfound powers and fame, they must content with the tyrannical Doctor Doom, who wants to destroy them all one by one. It's clobberin' time! This movie is pretty darn good. It has good action, good character development, good science (for all the nerds out there), and a decent story. All the characters are portrayed accurately and it's pretty funny sometimes when they interact with each other while other times their emotions are conveyed quite well. Doctor Doom is a great villain, absolutely powerful and deceitful, a deadly combination. The big fight in the end is worth the wait.I only wish that they add more action in this movie, like have the Thing beat down a few criminals, but what can I do? Overall, nicely done. A mostly faithful adaptation to the classic comic book.",7,5,8,24 October 2011
Annihilation," Dare to journey into the unknown?
","It has been a while since I saw a film that challenged me intellectually or one that straight up messed with my mind. Well, here's one that does both, 'Annihilation', based on a book by Jeff VanderMeer. Plot: Natalie Portman stars as Lena, a former soldier turned biologist who joins a five-woman group sent to investigate the source of the Shimmer, an expanding otherworldy force altering the landscape and wildlife in radical ways. As the group draws closer to their goal, they themselves undergo changes both mentally and physically. This is a story H.P. Lovecraft would be proud of in terms of a cosmic force twisting the perception of those in contact with it. The affected land combines awe-inspiring beauty with unsettling horror, especially where the few creatures seen are concerned and the effects used to bring them to life combined with the natural setting are a real beauty. The explanation of how things work is equally interesting and the source of this bizarre phenomenon is treated with an ambiguous, less-is-more nature. Lena's personal journey is pretty well-crafted, though I feel that there's one aspect regarding her marriage with Kane (Oscar Isaac) that could've been handled differently. Most of the film has this quiet, somber feel with little music used, allowing the atmosphere to settle in and put you in the characters' positions, walking a blurry line between marvel and uneasiness. My main criticism would be while the acting is fine, some of the cast don't leave much of an impression, especially Jennifer Jason Leigh as the rather lifeless Dr. Ventress. Another one would be one or two decisions made by members of the group being shortsighted and rather predictable.All in all, 'Annihilation' is a mind-boggling, thought-provoking venture into the unknown and a nice piece of pure sci-fi storytelling. If you can handle a little disturbing imagery, then you may find enjoyment in this adaptation.",7,0,2,9 June 2018
Incredibles 2," A glorious continuation of a classic.
","You know what's incredible? That it took 14 years to get this long-desired sequel. About dang time! Anyway, 'Incredibles 2' is finally here and I got to see it in the cinema. Normally, when Hollywood takes years to get a sequel out it tends to suck, but thankfully that is not the case here. Director Brad Bird was very mindful of what worked in the first film and continued the story in the appropriate manner. Plot: Picking up right where things were left off, the superhero family still faces difficulty wanting to save the world when supers are still banned worldwide. It is here that they are approached by Winston Deavor, TV tycoon and longtime fan, who wants to improve the public image of supers by broadcasting their endeavors in the hopes of making them legal, to which Bob and Helen agree to play along. Things seem to be looking up for them until the mysterious Screenslaver decides to complicate matters.Bird makes the interesting choice of reversing the roles of the parents, this time having Helen/Elastigirl playing hero and Bob/Mr. Incredible caring for the kids. This led to some great development since they are now somewhat out of their established roles in the first film and facing the inherent challenges that come with them; Bob struggling to raise his kids is both endearing and relatable to anyone who has children. The kids themselves have more to do this time around as well, especially baby Jack Jack with all the crazy powers he's gaining. Most of the actors return to their roles with one exception and they all fit like a glove; Sam Jackson and Bird as Frozone and Edna are still fun to watch. New heroes are introduced as well and each brings their own flair to the table, though only one, a portal-opener named Void, is fleshed out. The villain, while not as entertaining as Syndrome, definitely stands out and offers both substantial threat and interesting commentary, though the character's motivation does overlook a vital detail within the world's lore. The action and animation are top notch as ever as they take full advantage of the characters respective abilities, especially the train scene involving Helen on a motorcycle, and the music is still catchy as hell.Part of me was afraid that this film wouldn't live up to the hype and my expectations, but that was all laid to rest after watching this. 'Incredibles 2' is a worthy sequel through and through. If you love the first film, then do see for yourself.",8,1,2,30 June 2018
Jurassic Park," You will believe dinosaurs are alive again.
","Oh man, do I really have to explain why this movie is so freakin' fantastic? This movie revolutionized special effects with its flawless CGI and it is proof of the wondrous cinematic powers of Stephen Spielberg. The great vision of Spielberg is combined with the story and imagination of Michael Crichton, author of the book of the same name, to create the golden masterpiece that is Jurassic Park.The story is truly timeless. Billionaire John Hammond, a man with great vision, brings together scientists, theorists, and businessmen alike to a tour unlike any other: a park inhabited by living, breathing dinosaurs brought back to life through cloning. When a spy messes with the security systems to steal Jurassic Park property, everyone's lives are at stake as the carnivores of the prehistoric era seek them out as prey.This movie has it all: great action, intriguing sci-fi, wonderful music, memorable characters, amazing (and revolutionary) special effects, funny thought-provoking dialog, and a terrific cast of creatures. So many scenes are a splendor to watch from the Brachiosaur sighting to the T-Rex rampage. The dinosaurs are treated as they should be, not as monsters but as animals merely following their instincts. It almost makes you think that the dinosaurs are really there.Despite a few factual inaccuracies, Jurassic Park remains to be one of the greatest films ever and, like the dinosaurs, will stand the test of time until the end of days.",9,1,1,16 November 2011
