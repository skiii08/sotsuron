The Avengers," The True Comic Book Movie
","There's something unique about this movie. It speeds through a complex back story (many back stories actually) and yet makes it work through excellent dialog and even more incredible and often subtle acting. It adds more action than a Michael Bay film but does it right by investing the audience beforehand, not to mention how much better the actual action is. It assembles characters with very uneven powers but manages to make them all shine.Basically it's excellent. Everything's good in it. But I'll just state the reasons you should see it. The dialog and character interaction is AMAZING. The fight choreography is unrivaled. The comedy is just as incredible as the action and they often intersect beautifully. The cast is excellent. The villain makes the world conquering routine seem fresh (which is not easy to do). The stakes are high but at the same time it's a personal battle. Each of the characters has a different reason for being there and the movie gives them all importance which is one of the most difficult things about ensembles like this. There are even more subtle story arcs that expand the viewers interest in the heroes personalities given them depth while foreshadowing directions for future films in this franchise.There are a lot of things this movie had to overcome that it did beautifully. For one thing it was the first movie that I know of that attempted to build off of other stand-alone films. It connects them quite well. Then it had to survive the editing room. Apparently over an hour of footage was left out (most probably at the request of the studio). The pacing is still great. It had to live up to fans expectations. Don't know about other fans but I've been collecting comics since I was 8 and this movie blew my mind. Joss Whedon's greatest achievement had to be to introduce these characters to each other, create group tensions and then quickly have them learn to work together. If you pay attention you can see them learn each others rhythms and adapt to each others styles slowly as the movie progresses.I especially enjoyed Mark Ruffalo. I was skeptical about this casting choice (even though I really liked him in Shutter Island). I have to say he plays the hulk much more enjoyably than any previous incarnation. While others have always portrayed him in a more clich√©'d 'Jeckyl and Hyde' style, he plays him with his own technique. He attempts the character of Bruce Banner like a person who's learnt to overcome a crippling addiction/flaw, similar to what a lot of recovering rageaholics (real thing) go through. But the world and Loki seem to be begging him to release 'the other guy'. You truly feel for once, that the Hulk and Bruce Banner are the same person but in very different states of mind, which is how it's supposed to be. He also has a sense of humour about his condition making him more likable than the usual whiny Bruce Banners. His Hulk is just the most amazing character. When the big fight scene happens he does not disappoint.The cinema experience is great. The movie is 2 and a half hours long but just flies by.What I personally most enjoyed about the movie is that it wasn't shy about being a comic book movie. In fact it celebrated the comic book over the top attitude with everyone and not just fans. There was no humor in this that was an in joke that only fans would get. It pokes fun and shows flaws in its heroes. It makes the hero villain struggle very enjoyable.Basically this is the movie I've wanted since I was a kid. It's big and it's smart but also didn't have to go to dark and gritty story lines like a lot of other comic book movies (which often feels out of place and humourless to me).A definite must-see.",10,1,4,23 May 2012
Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3: Pretty Good
","Iron Man 3 is Marvel's latest entertaining cash-cow. As a huge fan of comics in general, I was really looking forward to this movie. From the trailers I had already resigned myself to the fact that we live in a 'post 9/11' world. Having accepted that, I was ready for a movie about terrorists or evil corporations or wars with other countries. This was not what I had expected. In fact, it took some risks and liberties with the Iron Man mythos that may upset hardcore fans. However, I consider myself a hardcore fan and I liked it fine. There was this little movie that came out a while ago called Avengers. This is a direct follow-up to that independent low-budget cult film (ok enough sarcasm). Iron Man 3 takes place a little after the 'New York' incident ' (the events of the Avengers, not to be confused with 9/11), where after Tony Stark has decided to do what every millionaire superhero does in the third part of a trilogy: become an obsessive hermit. He builds better stronger multi-application suits in his spare time. What can I say, he's better at pissing away money than Bruce Wayne. Stark narrates the film, possibly reading from a copy of Warren Ellis's 'Extremis' (I really wanted that to be the ending). I won't write what happens in case you haven't read that book, but I will say this is more of Stark's past coming back to bite him in the ass... much like the other 2 films (albeit in a different way). This sequence sets the tone for the rest of the film. The villains are terrorists using bio-enhancements. That's about all I can say without spoiling the movie, really. (there's a spoilers version on my blog)Shane Black takes charge of this part of the trilogy, which was a great choice of directors. I'm a fan of his amazing dialogue and very intelligent, elaborate fight scenes. Keeping in mind this is Shane Black, I was expecting a darker plot. Gladly, he kept it light and campy when it needed to be, but also wasn't afraid to pull out a death scene. He really knows how to pump up the intensity. I felt like this was a true successor to the Avengers in terms of tone (and I think music as well), but also wasn't afraid of exploring it's villains a little deeper. It's still comic booky and it's REALLY soaks that in. It's not afraid to be over-the-top, which I admire. I thought that was a major flaw with the Nolan Batman films. They seemed to be ashamed of being comic book movies, so they ended up not feeling like it.The fight scenes are goofy as hell but just what I want to see from a comic book movie. The dialogue is ridiculously good. Stark is snarky and always has something to say, just the way we like it. They don't ignore the existence of the rest of the movies. In fact there are clever references all over the place. The soundtrack does it's job. If you were a fan of the Avengers soundtrack, you'll notice the similarities (particularly the ending scene track of this movie and 'A Promise'). Musical motifs linking the movies are definitely in there.... (Go to Full Review to read the rest)",10,7,22,25 April 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," The review you need, not the one you deserve!
","So Let's see, The Conclusion to Chris Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. Starting with Batman Begins which was a great movie that pioneered the new wave of superhero films with blockbuster action and near art house philosophy with superheroes at the center. It took the concept of fear and turning it into power. Then came what is considered Nolan's greatest work, The Dark Knight. The Dark Knight brought in an engaging villain, ideas of anarchy vs control, real tragedy and analysis on what it takes to turn a hero to the dark side. Then came this movie...Well I personally don't care for it. It's long and pretentious and has loads of laughable moments. Bruce Wayne is written to be a little annoying and out of character. There are GAPING plot holes, nonsensical writing and odd creative decisions.First, what I like about the movie: Bane and Cat-woman. Bane is great. Tom Hardy is a great actor. He can be just a little hard to understand at times but did a great job nonetheless with an intelligent yet intimidating portrayal. That said, the character he played was Bane, in name only. No characteristics were taken from the comics otherwise. Cat-woman is great and that's all I can say. Her scenes are the most fun to watch in the movie.So where did the movie go wrong? Well, it has a lot to say but never takes the time to say it. It's also over 2 and a half hours long, which I don't usually mind but the editing and pacing are very hectic. It never takes the time to examine it's characters. Batman is a whiny recluse now and that character change plays no real part in the story later. The Batman voice is even more annoying in this one. The plot of the Dark Knight is made completely useless. They could have skipped that movie and gone to this one and everything would have been fine. the only remnant is Bruce Wayne's trauma (which goes NOWHERE) and the Dent act which caused peace (which goes NOWHERE). Things they could have cut out of the movie to save time since they clearly lengthened the movie ad cut bits and pieces everywhere.Bane has an overly complicated plan that involves (yet is not limited to) stealing Bruce Wayne's fingerprints, bankrupting him, breaking batman and throwing him into prison, destroying the city for the next 5 months, taking over the city and revealing the lies of commissioner Gordan, using tech from Wayne industries to break open black gate prison, then nuking the city. In that exact order. Why not just break Batman then nuke the city?Some Questions: If Bane has Bruce's fingerprints why is he stealing his tech? And why bankrupt him if you're just going to throw him in a pit and take over the city anyway? What is Bane's motivation really? He says the criminals are oppressed by the government but never explains how. His MO keeps changing though out the movie really Why is he attacking Gotham and claiming it needs to be saved like this when the first 30 minutes established Gotham is perfectly fine and at 'peace time'? If you're going to say because the commissioner lied about Two-face you'd be wrong because the league of shadows has no problem with lying and deceit to gain power (evidenced by Batman Begins and this movie). Why put Batman, WORLDS GREATEST DETECTIVE, in a prison A CHILD once escaped from? Why keep him alive anyway? The entire 'your punishment must be more severe' line has no logic in it. The league of shadows kills its enemies but now it just keeps the most dangerous ones alive?Talia al Ghul appears. I have issues with this. Why do her and Bruce Suddenly start having sex completely out of nowhere when they've JUST met? she says she hated her father for banishing Bane but still wants to carry out his plan. WHY? Why send EVERY policeman in Gotham to fight Bane in the sewers? couldn't they have gassed the sewer instead or kept some officers on the surface?Aside from those questions, there is really no chemistry between Bruce and Talia or Batman and Cat-woman or Bane and Talia. These romances happen without any prior indication and just confused me.It's not very faithful to the comics, but Nolan never wanted it to be anyway. I don't mind that and the other 2 movies did it pretty well, but in this case it's so far from the comics that there's no reason for this to be a Batman film. NONE. Other than the costumes. Where is the detective work? Where is the use of intelligence? Where is the dark atmosphere? most of this movie happens in the day time. Where's the noir feel that Batman is known for? Bane is nothing like this in the comics and for that matter neither is Talia.But I'd let that slide if the plot made logical sense. Bane's and Talia's deaths are both completely lackluster scenes. The ending was predictable and foreshadowed heavily by both Lucius Fox and Alfred. And speaking of the ending... BATMAN DOESN'T QUIT!!!!! WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS THAT ABOUT? ONE OF THE MAIN FOCUSES OF THE COMICS IS BATMAN'S OBSESSION WITH CRIME AND HOW IT CONSUMES HIS LIFE!! HE STAYS BATMAN TILL OLD AGE. It might sound nit- picky but it's a major trait that batman has.There's just so much wrong with this movie. It has great scenes but they don't make sense in terms of the over-all film. Things aren't really explained very well either. to each their own I guess. This was not for me.",4,7,14,23 August 2012
