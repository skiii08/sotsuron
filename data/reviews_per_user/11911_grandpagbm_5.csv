Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Interesting -- It Surprised Me
","I am definitely not a fan of Quentin Tarantino. The only films of his that I have seen are the two in the Kill Bill series. I was interested in seeing them primarily because Uma Thurman and David Carradine (in the second one) were the leads, with an interesting supporting cast.This second film in the series is not nearly as bloody and violent as the first, although there is plenty of both. The dialog between David Carradine and Uma Thurman at the end of the movie is fascinating, a complete departure from the action leading up to it. Carradine's performance is as excellent as Thurman's. As in the first, the selections of music are very interesting, fitting the different segments well, but also representing odd choices. I was most surprised by the very end of the film, which neatly tied up all the loose ends and had a storybook finish. This was not what I expected from Tarantino. It was a pleasant surprise.",7,0,1,3 November 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Just a Lead-In for the Next Installment of the Series
","This is the second of the series Pirates of the Caribbean. It is not nearly as good as the first one. It is a typical Disney pirate adventure film, with much of it designed to appeal to youngsters. This one contains even more silly stunts, done with computer graphics. The story is so convoluted that it makes virtually no sense. The special effects are done well, and it's fun to watch Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightley perform, but they don't have much of a script to work with. Finally, the ending makes it clear that this is just the forerunner for the next installment. It is not a complete movie, unfortunately. I probably will not watch it again, but will keep it in my collection as part of the total series.",5,0,0,3 November 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," I'm Not a Tarantino Fan, But This Is Intriguing
","I am definitely not a fan of Quentin Tarantino. The only films of his that I have seen are the two in the Kill Bill series. I was interested in seeing them primarily because Uma Thurman and David Carradine (in the second one) were the leads, with an interesting supporting cast.Tarantino has a thing about blood in these movies, with the red fluid being sprayed copiously around the sets. He also enjoys showing an outlandish amount of violence and the after-effects of it. I am not impressed by these features. However, there is something oddly intriguing about these films. The drama, the off-center dialog, the action scenes (even with the blood), and the storyline are fascinating. The weird assortment of music enhances well each segment. He also has a penchant for odd things such as using a sizable chunk of Japanese anime, flashes between color and black-and-white, inserts of titles for various segments, off-and-on foreign language dialog with subtitles, unexpected flash-backs and flash-forwards, and an other-worldly presentation in general. The cast members do an excellent job in their roles, and the makeup and costumes add a nice touch. Finally, it is easy to sympathize with the main character and her quest for revenge.I saw the Volume 2 film before I saw the Volume 1. Normally, I would never do that on purpose, but I had heard that the second one was the best, and I had the opportunity to see it first. I agree that the second in the series is better than the first, but I was curious to see Volume 1, anyway. It appears to me that the first one was more bloody than the second, although it is probably a close call. I think Tarantino is weird, but I have to admit that he makes an interesting film, even if it's not really my cup of tea.",7,1,3,3 November 2008
Casino Royale," Improved by a Second Look
","I saw this movie in the theater, when it was released, and I really didn't care for it. I knew that much of my reaction was because I was unhappy with how significantly they had changed the Bond mystic this time around. I was always a fan of James Bond films, from the first to the last one before this. Although the 007 persona changed from time to time over the years, partially to keep him up with the changing times, he was still the same basic recognizable character. But, in this movie, the only anchor to the past was Judi Dench playing the character M. There was not even a Q in this movie, and I was unhappy about that. I had looked forward to seeing John Cleese playing Q in more Bond films. Also, this film had too many twists to try to follow. And, like many Bond fans, I didn't know who Daniel Craig was and didn't care for his very different presentation of 007. Most confusing was the fact that the story was completely out of the time line for the series. In the movie, this is Bond's first assignment as a 00 agent, which would place it before Dr. No in story chronology. Yet, it was set in today's time. This was very disconcerting.After watching the movie on DVD, almost two years later, I have a different feeling about it. I now accept the changes (especially after watching the special features DVD that was included in the movie set). I also paid close attention to Craig's acting and found that I do like his style. He was an excellent 007. Something I noticed this time is that Craig looks and acts very much like Steve McQueen, a favorite action film actor of mine from decades ago. Now, I place this Bond film as one of the better ones in the series. I will enjoy watching it often.",10,0,1,3 November 2008
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Still Outstanding
","I still recall the feelings I experienced when I saw this movie for the first time. The opening title sequence grabbed my attention. When the text began scrolling across the screen, I remembered how a number of older films used that technique to explain the setting and the situation at the beginning of the movie. But, this was very different. The older movies had the words moving slowly and evenly from the bottom of the screen to the top. This film moved the words from front to back, using perspective to make it appear that they were disappearing into space, like a space ship flying away. The opening scene appeared to be earth, but I soon realized that there were two suns, not one. Then, I heard laser firing sounds and a large spaceship came across the screen. I thought that was really cool. But, following that ship was another that dwarfed the first one. In fact, the second one completely filled the screen as it moved past. I was in awe, along with the rest of the audience. From that moment on, I was hooked.This film set new standards for special effects in movies and for making a science fiction movie fun and interesting. It was the first movie I saw with Harrison Ford in a major role, and he became a favorite of mine. Using James Earl Jones for Darth Vader's voice was a stroke of genius.I still get great enjoyment out of watching this film, as well as great emotional memories. I will watch it often.",10,0,0,3 November 2008
