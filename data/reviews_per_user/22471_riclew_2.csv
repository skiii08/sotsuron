The Blair Witch Project," NOT SCARY! GET IT INTO YOUR MINDS! *cough*RIP OFF*cough*
","If you have seen the likes of THE LAST BROADCAST and CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST you will realise how mediocre and over hyped this film really is. At the time I saw it, I thought it was OK, nothing special, but different. Only when I researched a bit did I find this film is totally unoriginal. The only part I would say that is mildly scary is the end, but that is all! I also found that parts of the end have just been taken from THE LAST BROADCAST and CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. I can pick out at least 10 points where parts of scenes which have been ripped off from THE LAST BROADCAST. Overall I would say CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST and THE LAST BROADCAST are far better films. THE LAST BROADCAST taking a different view and so, not completely ripping off CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. Don't bother renting THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT out, if there was any scare in it, it was in the cinema. Home viewings will make this film even worse for you, and far from scary. Rent out THE LAST BROADCAST, or try finding a copy of CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST somewhere, if you have the guts that is!",2,0,2,22 February 2001

","Im sorry but with all its hype and awards I thought this would be an amazing film. What I found was a film which sent me to sleep twice. It had a good story I suppose, but the way it was done was just so boring. One good thing I can say about this film is Russel Crowe, I take my hat off to him (well if I was wearing one), he was brilliant in this film, he really did get my sympathy but this wasnt enough to keep me interested. I can see how it got the awards I suppose, its one of those films which is just saying GIVE ME OSCARS! Rent it at the most, but beware you might enjoy the sight of the inside of your eyelids more.",1,24,52,3 February 2001
