Skyfall," Best Bond ever,really its great
","Ow my god Skyfall,what's not to love, its Bonds 23rd mission,50 years. Right Skyfall is a sequel to Quantum of solace witch is a sequel to Casino royale. Skyfall opens up with a bang and closes with a bang. The first scene with the chase though a European country,witch ends with a 'ow no she didn't'.Craig brings back the best bond to date with being funny at times and angry at times buts its the little things Craig does that bring class to bond, like sort-en out his cuff-lings after jumping from the crane,though the roof to the train was just class and funny. the bad guy Javier Bardem as Silva, let me tell you he is mean. The new Q played by Ben Whishaw is great, Bond dose take the micky out of him for being young mind, the effects in the film are great, one off the effects was the underground crash was holy cow... lets just say its better than the one in coronation street.There is a sad part where M sadly dies :'( all in all Skyfall get a EXCELLENT 10/10 See this film.",10,8,18,22 December 2012

The Hobbit is.....bloody perfect.The Hobbit Bilbo(Martin Freeman),the Dwarf's are great,funny,are great fighters and not bad at singing am only going to talk about one Thorin Oakenshield ( Richard Armitage) this is a Dwarf you don't want to pick a fight with, he saw the Dwarfs king get beheaded in the battle to retake they castle, and this dwarfs fight the white orc (hes is very very mean)and slices off one of his hands,the film also has funny parts to it,one part that was great was the great goblin when hes says to Gandalf(Ian McKellen)how you going to kill me,& and Gandalf pokes him in the eye and slices his chest and the goblin falls over and say yep that'll do it. that was epic, the fights scenes are perfect in 3D the visual effects are also perfectly done.
