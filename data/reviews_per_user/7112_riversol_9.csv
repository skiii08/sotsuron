Sucker Punch," Creative Eyecandy on Fire
","Sucker Punch smacks you down!This movie is a softly violent blend of Kill Bill and Inception with a touch of Lord of the Rings, Terminator and Mortal Kombat thrown in for good measure. Unlike Inception, this movie succeeds because it isn't didactically trying to make you buy into the premise, it just lays out the story, and let's you decide what might or might not be going on.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the creative mix of both the action dream sequences, and to a lesser degree the character development. There is much subtlety crafted into this plot and the main character's subjugations and aspirations. If I have one gripe, the use of sepia and dark grayscale tones throughout the movie is overused. This was obviously the film maker's intent to bring out color when it does appear, as in the dragonfire, alas I feel true color could have been used to more advantage, so long as it didn't rise to the over color saturation movies like Avatar fell prey to.Absolutely recommended if you like intense kung fu surreality flicks!",8,1,1,18 August 2011
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Not their best
","I bit disappointed especially since I am a Brian myself.  The religious satire does not go far enough. Some chuckle scenes, but only the closing song Look on the Bright Side of Life is thoroughly worthy of Monty's stamp.",6,9,30,11 June 2001
Underworld," A horror movie with bite
","It's been too long since a good horror movie has come out.  Underworld isn't the greatest, but it does a fine job of creating a dark world full of mystery and action.  At time the plot threads are a little tangled, but I think that adds to the overall immersion in the vampire/werewolf world.My two main gripes were the werewolves when they ran on the walls and ceilings.  Supernatural or not, it looked stupid.  And the final scene death scene of Victor, specifically the delayed action decapitation is a total copy of the Kurgan's death in Highlander.Oh one last gripe.  Michael's super powerful were-vamp transformation was also a big let down.  My imagination had some combination of Giger's alien integrated with bat and human features.  Overall though, the best classic horror genre flick since Brotherhood of the Wolf and Gingersnaps.",8,0,0,1 October 2003
Eyes Wide Shut," An Eye Opener
","This movie was a thought provoker.  Overall, the acting and atmosphere are a bit over the top and the slow pace detracts a bit, but as any work of art, the spectator needs to fathom a message for him or herself.The central theme explores the theme of how much truth one should share with ones lover.  Can one live with a charade, especially with ones most intimate confidant?  Whether a sexual fantasy or an entanglement in a murder, do we kill a part of ourselves by lying or not revealing this truth, or does sanity necessitate a scheme of white lies within and without oneself.This film makes a daring attempt to get people talking about what they really think and feel.",8,0,1,22 December 2000
A Beautiful Mind," Hollywood distortion
","Good acting by Crowe.  Good glossy package by Howard.Atrocious movie, because it captures the mind, falsely, as a documentary, and leaves out too much of the controversial and true facts:  Nash's bisexuality, divorce, and spontaneous remission of his disorder, to name a few.Oliver Stone would be proud of this commercially recreated biography.",4,0,1,13 July 2002
Signs," No coincidences here...just a horrible movie!
","Deepak Chopra must have a credit in here somewhere! A horrible blend of faith and extraterrestrials.A whole bunch of contrived and miraculous coincidences.Uh, I guess God sent the UFOs to kill off a whole bunch of humans just to convert Mel's stoicly portrayed character back into a happy and faithful reverend.Bad!  My nominee for MST3000 Movie of the Year! The grey alien at the end must be clicking: 'I'm melting! I'm melting!'",1,4,7,4 August 2002
Tarzan," An enjoyable Disney film which breaks Disney trends
","I always look forward to Disney's releases with the simultaneous fear of seeing a G watered down story.  Like Mulan however, Tarzan transcends being simply a child's story with realistic and, at times, dark moments.  The shadow hanging of Tarzan's nemesis at the end is particularly eerie.  The animation and humor excel but only sometimes.  Jane and her father are flat as the pre-Copernican world, both in character and animation.  Yet this Disney film is worth seeing, if not alone for the underlying theme of wildlife preservation.",7,0,0,1 October 1999
Gangs of New York," Suspended my suspension of disbelief
","This movie was a recreation of history with a multi-color pallet that doesn't lend itself to realism. The characters are unconvincing for the most part, albeit a decent accent by Dan, Liam and even Leo.  The fight scenes are a bloody work of faux wrestling with missed punches obvious as the bright red dripping from the musty brown landscape.  Still I found a moment or two interesting; the backdrops were especially magnificent, though perhaps too well designed in that I never entirely felt I was in the 1800's, just on an expensive set of said era.I give Gangs a hearty uppercut...without pulling the punch.",5,2,4,22 July 2003
Donnie Darko," Donnie Dorko
","This movie's aspect of being dark and deep is all pretense; the plot is a convoluted and non-sequitur growth, but without any compelling central matrix for the ideas to root. Noah, Barrymore and Swayze have thankfully minor roles, the first two give especially poor B movie performances.But it is Jake's performance who is at the center of this mess, and his jerky, schizophrenic performance may have been intentional, but simply doesn't work, though he does have a few moments standing up for life's complexity vice the love-fear model.Yet it is the plot which brings this movie down.  Unlike Memento, Sliding Doors, Groundhog's Day, or even the Prince of Darkness, which use the nuances of a time continuum slyly, Donnie Darko succeeds in knotting up the stream of time.  Hawking's ideas for spatial wormholes is weakly presented, but they have no direct connection to time travel.Altogether this movie is a sloppy mix of 12 Monkeys, It's A Wonderful Life, Magnolia, Harvey, the Abyss and a pinch of ET.  An eerie blend, for sure, and many may mistake the remix as originality.",4,1,2,10 April 2002
