50 First Dates," 50 First Dates
","I don't normally like Adam Sandler movies, but I do love Drew Barrymore. This is not your typical Sandler movie. Set in beautiful Hawaii, 50 First Dates is about a commitment phobic who falls for this girl with whom he can not possibly have a normal future with. Lucy, the girl of his dreams, is a sweet, art teacher who has no memory of anything lasting longer than a day. Her family support is her dad and brother who end every day by getting ready to start the day over like it is the same day every time, October 13, 200?. It is one of the sweetest romantic comedies I have seen in a long time. I love the music that accompanies the movie because it is set in Hawaii and it fits each scene perfectly. This movie is a cute way for a guy who seems to have no chance of a normal life with a girl who has memory-afflicted problems. It's sweet because he's willing to do anything to get this girl to fall in love with him each day. The ending is more realistic than most of these Hollywood-type movies. It's a must see!",10,0,0,13 April 2005
