Your Name.," A movie you must watch
","There are only a limited number of animation movies that make every frame look like an artisan masterpiece of drawing. I have watched Makoto Shinkai's previous movies. They were very beautiful too, but the stories were a bit slow and boring. Your Name started with a typical sci-fi settings. Yes, you have heard about this kind of stories many many times. But wait for the story-line emerges you for the exact feeling of the main character. I feel like a lot more stories can be told but Shinkai tried hard to give a shorter version. I hope more deleted scenes will be available in the BlueRay version.Quality: Extremely high. Story: Very good; makes you think about it afterwards. Music: I enjoyed it.",10,2,5,20 February 2017
The Babadook," Ending is not well-explained
","spoiler alert!This is NOT a demon obsessed movie, but it made itself look like one. The idea is not new. Many good horror/thriller movies have similar story, for example, hide-and-seek. Nonetheless this movie has a pretty good style of story telling.Many audiences don't like a confusing ending that's not well-explained. Unfortunately this movie falls into this category, which I actually like a lot. Hints for the true story are between casual lines and are sufficient for a viewer to get a rough idea what's going on.If you don't like to solve the puzzle of the hidden meanings in the graphics and in conversation, then don't watch this movie.",9,3,5,15 April 2016
Watchmen," As good as Batman: Dark Knight
","A lot of Superhero movies tried to give the audience a good story. In most of recent super hero stories, characters live in more realistic worlds.Unfortunately, many of them still failed to forge villains with characteristics in depth. It's unbearable to see stupid stories about people who want to achieve world domination, to revenge his family, to be obsessed a silly idea so he needs to destroy the world, to collect souls, to create a new land for demons/aliens/neo-humans/etc.This movie is not 'yet another superhero movie'. It didn't disappoint me like many other superhero movies.There are only two Superhero movies I would recommend. This movie, and Batman: Dark Knight.",10,2,5,4 March 2017
The Legend of 1900," Watched it in year 2017. Loved it.
","I have this movie in my bookmark link for like several months. The title and the trailer of this movie didn't attract me at all. Because the title pretty much already told me there is no much contents in this story. It turned out I was right, yet a very simple story with overwhelming emotional moments. I fell in love to this movie in the first 10 minutes with its unique background of the character. If you have your own life-stories, you can resonate with the conversation. Unfortunately this is a movie for people who have really lived, enjoyed, and suffered. Probably very boring to many young people. I will definitely recommend this to people in my age. Not to mention the music is beautiful.",10,1,3,22 January 2017
