The Rock," Sink Like A Rock
","First of all, I've spent a good  portion of my life in the armed forces, and I can tell you that the type of decisions  about life and death begin made by Ed Harris in this movie are overglorified as hell. He leads a cast of annoying, underachieving actors who play this goofy marine outfit who has decided they want to bringjustice to the world again. True, they were portrayed as having some greatinjustice done to them in the past, but you don't try to get revenge like some Iron Curtain Communist. Nick Cage is your typical bad actor in this movie, and one has to wonder what ever convinced Sean Connery to go along for the ride onthis movie. Cage is like that shaky trigger finger I had towards the end of my military career...you kinda get used to it but you wish it would go the hell away. To add to the shame, the action is contrived and the plot is udderly rediculous. Some people say the car chase is the best they've ever seen in a movie. Hello! Have you ever gotten out of bed people? I've had more interesting car chaseson my way to the grocery store in my 85 Tempo. Then we get to the part aboutthe SEAL team. I've come to know a few elite soldiers in my life time, and none of them would be so stupid as to get caught in a shower room at a grossdisadvantage. The whole access to the island is rediculous, crawling throughtunnels of fire and mysterious moving parts that are supposed to look like they have some function in the world. This movie is a horrid depiction of soldiers. Then there's the background music. It sounds like Dean Martin crossed withreally bad John Williams. If they were alive, real composers like Brahms, Mahler, Shostakovich and Hindemith would love to line up as the firing squad to shoot rotten eggs at the people who wrote the score to this movie. You might think this is a negative review, but I actually give this movie a 9 out of 10, for the comedy factor. This is the perfect movie to kick back with a case of beer, and laugh out loud at with your best friends.",Null,1,2,6 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I want the guys in the white plastic suits back
","First of all, I'm a traditional American who doesn't really go for all this space hocus pocus. That Star Track with Dr. Spock and Mr. Kirk really doesn't appeal to me either. I'm a good, god-fearing citizen who enjoys a cold beer and ahotdog as much as I would racing around in some stupid pod racer with a bunch of green men. I really didn't see how this story fit at all into the Star Wars saga. What ever happened to Luke? Did he just dissapear in this film or what? Also, I want the hoards of plastic-suited guys back. They were so cool when theymarched around and zapped people. I haven't seen anything as rediculous asthat since the time we had a tennis tournament on the deck of the U.S.S.Enterprise. We lost like 10 sleeves of ball in the damn ocean before we decided just to kick back and enjoy some burgers and sodas. Yea, those were thedays...I want Bob Solo and Dark Veder back..",Null,1,2,22 May 2002
Insomnia," Pacino, I salute thee!
","I walked out of this movie feeling like I was born again with new skin. As it looks now, this may be the only movie actually worth going to this summer. Al Pacino is a true American patriot in this movie. Robin Williams plays an excellent bad guy - kinda like the garbage man who always used to spend more time at your garbage than anyone elses, and you thought he was looking through your wife's underwear or something. This movie is set in the most beautiful and patriotic of states, Alaska, and Hilary Swank contributes to this movie's higher-than-average babe factor. If you liked this movie, like I did, chances are you: 1. Love natural-skin hotdogs,  2. Know the words to taps,  3. Have served your country gallantly,  4. Are a god-fearing patriotic  American citizen. I give this film a 9 out of 10.",Null,0,0,4 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack of the Mid-afternoon nap
","It was there, in that plush representation of a vintage chair that I glided into a mid-afternoon slumber, as images of two dorks floundering in a flowery meadow and riding a elephant-beetle-beast-thing flashed infront of my closed eyelids. I thought Episode II was a complete disaster, even worse than the first one. Lucas blew several opportunities to display graphic violence for scenes of lush meadows and stormy seas. What this movie needed was an edge, and only the type of edge that the monumental and legendary actor Billy Drago can deliver. At least he could have saved the film. This movie isn't dark because it is negative and warlike, it is dark because everyone falls asleep while watching it.  Episode III better well be violent as hell (because of this supposed war that is supposed to be happening) or else I will be forced to finally conclude that Lucas is catering to all the little Kiddies out there in theater land. Why can't he make movies like Episode IV, where Spock dies and Robert or whatever his name is has to go and save him from the hideous, flame-throwing monster?",Null,0,0,21 May 2002
American Beauty," What's goin on here?
","First...I was totally lost during this whole film? Are you supposed to be able to get some meaning out of this thing? Why did the marine kill Spacey? I'm totally distraught here! I like intelligent films..I'm a fan of Billy Drago, the best actor ever, but this film totally lost me. I thought the whole film was supposed to be through Ricky's camera. Jane and Tom didn't make any sense either. Hell, even Mena wasn't very good in this flick. She just didn't make sense. At least they could have put a raunchy sex scene in this flick. This film was even worse than showgirls. Is this supposed to be real life? There wasn't one explosion even! C'mon get real people, this film was worse than showgirls!!!",Null,0,0,10 May 2001
The Fast and the Furious," The Fast and the Hyddeous
","For movie go-ers these days there isn't much of a variety to choose from. You have the stupid Julia Roberts love stories, the stupid antics of Jackie Chan who's trying to be a funny Chuck Norris, and then the stupid action flicks with no plot. Every once and awhile you will find a movie that makes you think a little bit about society or whatever its subject happens to be. On the surface Fast and the Furious appears to be a stupid action flick with a retarded plot with awesome actions scenes as its only saving grace. Well, this is mostly true. The plot is bland and doesn't make any sense, a bunch of low down dead beats who appear to have no real jobs who can afford a bunch of crappy foreign cars. I'll take my Chevy K-5 any day thank you very much. But on to business. This movie actually has a deeper meaning than is inherently visible. This movie is actually a reversal of several biblical stories woven into a nice finish at the end. The director of this movie, Rob Colen, and Gary Scott Thomsen, adaptor of the screen story, bothattended King's College at Cambridge and this influence is once again present in this work. While studying at Cambridge both men were entranced by the works of C.S. Lewis and other great classics such as Homer's Odyssey and the bible. This story is not about car racing, love or any other stupid themes like that. What Thomsen and Colen have done here is reverse the outcome of several biblical and mythological stories. One that weighs heavily here is the Tower of Babel. 'The shadow of that Hyddeous Strength, Sax Myle and more it is of length.' This popular quote from the Welsh poet Sir David Lyndsay from his work entitled Ane Dialog, describes the tower of babel as observed in reference to the Fischer King mythology. The Tower of Babel crumbled from a lack of communication according to the myth. That could just as well happen in this representation of the system, but the undercover cop learns to communicate on a spiritual level with the racers, thus learing the importance for maintaining the honor of the racing world, and protecting the true protaganists at the end of the movie. Colen and Thomsen also appear to have taken elements from Greek mythology in the making of this movie as well. Consider these lines from Homer's Odyssey. 'Stand beside me, Athena, fire me with daring, fierce as the day we ripped Troy's glittering crown of towers down....Surely I will stand beside you, not forget you, not when the day arrives for us to do our work...' Doesn't this sound familiar to you from the movie? The conversations held before the night street race, before the big finale. Yes, Colen and Thomsen have not only made references in this film to biblical and mythological works but succeeded in blending them together seamlessly. The only thing they forgot was to include Billy Drago in their brilliant cast of actors. This movie has a deep meaning for today's society, as we crumble due to communication barriers all over the world. But people still can stand side by side with others and accomplish great things. I know, I was in the field as a soldier for many years and can tell you that brotherhood can still run strong in this fading world. If every movie was as inspiring as this one, no one would ever want to leave the theater again. In other words...

Saving Private Ryan," Worst Movie ever Made!!!
","I fell asleep during this movie twice, not to mention almost being tempted to leave the theater and chuck my corn at the screen. Tom Hanks is horrible in this film. He doesn't act seriously and comes across more as a comedian than a soldier. Steven Spielberg is a horrible director and couldn't direct a porn flick. This doesn't even compare with real war movies like Missing in Action. Hell, the landscapes in the movie didn't even look real. It looked like the characters were walking around in Ohio or something. This was definitely a waste of 5 dollars. Even Billy Drago couldn't have saved this disaster.",Null,0,1,10 May 2001
K-19: The Widowmaker," Could be Worse!
","How could this movie be worse than it already was? Simple: cast Ronald McDonald as the captain and Tara Reid as a sultry waitress to make the movie even more unbelievable. Simply put, the directors of this film managed to get almost every aspect of the story wrong. Events are transposed, and most of them are portrayed wrongly anyway. Harrison Ford trying to do a Russian accent is like a cheap pimp trying to sell auto insurance to the elderly in a small Montana town: it just doesn't work. In real life, Liam Neeson's character wasn't even supposed to be on the sub, but in the movie, he's there to give the cast that Shakspearian edge I guess. This has to be one of the worst war movies ever made, even worse than Braveheart. Not even Billy Drago could have saved this submarine movie from sinking to the bottom in a raging fireball. 0 out of 10.",Null,0,0,26 January 2003
The Untouchables," A touching Performance
","I see that the reviews for this film are somewhat mixed. Some like it and some hate it. I am one who likes this film, especially from an acting standpoint. Kostner is great, Connery is spectacular, but Billy Drago blows us audience away again. Movie after movie he has delivered stunning performances like the one in Delta Force 2, Operation Stranglehold. Drago's lines in this movie are finely crafted, and the only people who can say that he does a bad job are people who have tried to act like Drago and can't. These gealous idiots have no idea what a real actor is, and Drago comes through a true hero in this movie. Drago's costume is also very appropriate in this film. He is dressed as the fallen white angel, described by the Sardis and Philadelphia Dispensations in the latter part of the Hebrew Testament. Anyone else who tried to play this character would have failed. Drago delivers once again. 10 out of 10 for Drago. 7 out of 10 for the movie. Bravo.",Null,0,0,6 June 2001
X2: X-Men United," X-Doze
","I need someone to X-splain to me the purpose of this sequel. I don't usually go to see these new-aged sci-fi flicks, but I was taking care of my nephew Romel so I took him to see it. Now I'm a hardcore all-American who has seen a fire fight or two in his life, and I have to say that the action scenes in this film were terribly done. They were worse than making Mac-N-Cheese without milk or butter. What this film needed was a clear goal. I'm American so I believe in goals, apple pie, and that Tasha Yar should have never died on Star Track, because she was a true patriot. This film was a poor mix of crappy one-line jokes, action scenes that were not nearly gory enough, and cheesy X-plosions for X-citement. In my opinion, the director of this film should have designed the movie for an NC-17 rating and then went to work...instead of making it fit for all the kiddies out there. In addition, the casting was inX-scusable. Billy Drago should have been cast as Xavier, period. Chuck Norris and Rutger Hauer would have added the needed thespian punch. Instead you get a sour mix of second-rate actors that resemble that five-year old MGD sitting in your garage. All in all, I give this movie a 2 out of 10. BOOO!",Null,0,0,19 May 2003
