The Ring," good efects,very creepy,just about as good as the sixth sense
","The ring is a good movie overall horor,suspence.the plot is given away a little too easy in the begining, but anyone who likes a good horor movie will enjoy this one and probably the scaryest part would be the part where the murdering girl comes out of the TV. I am looking forward to the sequal so hang on everyone this is going to be a scary ride!",Null,1,1,11 March 2003
