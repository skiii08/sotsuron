Skyfall," Shaken but just not the right recipe and ingredients
","With a bond movie, one can never go into the hall wanting more of the same yet also hoping for something unique and spectacular in each edition. Skyfall is an attempt to stir up something different as a genre within Bond series but for me it fails to leave any sort of indelible imprint. Right from the opening trademark action sequence, you are left hoping fervently that as the script turns the corner something more gripping, more slick, more intense, laden with twists and turns would emerge. Sadly nothing of that sort happens and it ploughs through all the usual windings . Bond going missing, checking in again, crossing paths with a mysterious exotic woman. There is a heavy role for M and it is a strong performance by the Dame as contours of a tumultuous relationship between M and Bond is set out. Daniel Craig grows older and grows into the Bond role with ease and a more humane persona is presented to the audience. Someone who is still fit yet shown with his foibles. He is no more just suave but someone who is also weary, resigned and yet a soldier and patriot. In the end, there is no standout moment, there is no pulse racing sequence, no smouldering exchanges with a strong lady character, nothing by way of a script that makes you think even a fraction. It does have some soul by way of certain relationships, by way of a rather uncharacteristic villain and Javier Bardem is superb and very assured. A word about the Bond women. Berenice Marlohe is beautiful in a not so usual way and hence I feel that she has just been marginalised and there could have been a lot more for her in this movie. Naomie Harris is a bit of a stereotype and again exchanges involving her can just about make you smile feebly. Just as the opening, the climax is very staid 'bad guys lay siege and chase the good ones outnumbered and holed up behind the lines' and as movies closes, we are plain and simple assured of another Bond sequel and just as I started the movie and was hoping for something spectacular to emerge at every bend, I simple longed for something more and better as the credits rolled on..Maybe next time - Bond Loyalist.",7,2,7,3 November 2012
Rang De Basanti," a fusion of colours, past and present
","Beyond doubt, we all acknowledge the power of art to wake up inert souls. However it is a very thin line for one to cross from the desired goal of inspiring and overwhelming into soul less preaching So to that end, Rang de basanti, does cause a lump in your throat, a resonating call in your heart and certain empathy for the five likable, very different characters of this story, without ever lapsing into either maudlin sentiments or moralizing to bring to the fore the plague called corruption sweeping India. The revolutionaries of Indian freedom struggle (Bhagat Singh and Co) represent the righteousness and courage of the past and they seep into the five modern day characters who are jolted from their lackadaisical and somnolent day to day existence. Fate brings few college friends into contact with Sue a young penniless documentary film maker who cannot afford professional actors. The sacrifices and tribulations of the freedom fighters does leave a mark some where deep within the consciousness of the five friends. All it takes is a horrendous tragedy which then makes them take steps never contemplated before. The focus is on the moral awakening, the call for justice and not on the consequences of the drastic actions of the youth while attempting to make corrupt politicians and businessmen pay for their deeds. Aamir is magnetic and powerful in his role as events transform him from a college vagabond fearing reality of life and seeking solace in the four walls of a university to someone gripped by painful awakening of conscience. Each and every character (Siddharth, Soha, Madhavan, Atul, Sharman) essay their roles with consummate ease. The background score and cinematography is indicative of the new breed of technicians in Bollywood, slick and effective. The end is not pleasing to the mind or eye and is disproportionately brief but then one suspects that the director never wanted the end to be the fulcrum or highlight. It is in the narrative of the lives of the youth from pre to post a tragedy that remains as the food for thought. A very nice movie, well intentioned, and truly aimed at what the byline says ' A generation awakens'. Much needed for a nation which is showing clear signs of awakening. To pick faults would be to talk about script losing its tautness somewhere in between halfway and end, one song too many, a shallow probe into the malaise called corruption in Indian social and political setting. But then we all know the tumour exists, what is genuinely needed is a courage to pluck it out each and every time to prevent it from raising its head. The film I believe is in that respect will for sure strike a chord in the youth across the nation.",8,4,10,29 January 2006
Lost in Translation," beautifully innocent yet so real
",i am not embarking on a cinematic critical review but would like to begin by saying that if a movie has left me with warmth of a feeling or the cold shiver of an emotion or simply any touching emotion i think the moviemaker would have more often than not met the objective quest. this movie is the tale of two souls of our times who are absolutely lost in swirling waters of life which throws up few real options amongst apparent myriad options. Hence we are often magnetically drawn to people purely circumstantially as we seek solace in another person who can resonate some of our feelings if not all. It also captures very well the fact that age does not really often impede connection of minds Bill Murray and Scarllet are literally the only actors in the movie and they have performed to a T the roles as conceived i guess by Sofia Coppola. But the element of greatness will be clearly the poignant scenes of separation. Separation is always painful and that pain can be redeemed .. see the movie to know how,Null,0,1,11 July 2004
