Blade Runner 2049," The most important film of all time.
","Blade Runner 2049 takes us on an existential journey of understanding consciousness, empathizing with a creation many would deem unnatural or treat as less than human. For those who are willing to let the film breathe, take in each moment and feel the perspective of each of these characters, you're in for something truly special.There are countless aspects I could praise, such as the legendary visuals and score. But what makes this film so important is the deep dive into asking what makes us human, and what that ultimately means. It tackles this critical issue while also warning us where we may end up: a cold, corporate dystopia where our dignity is stripped for profit and everyone yearns for something real.",10,3,15,3 January 2020
