The Expendables 2," The best movie i have ever seen
",I went to watch this film the night it came out as i had seen the first one and was dying to see the second one. It was fantastic. The entire film is action packed and definitely worth watching in a cinema. The characters were perfect for the actors playing them and the persona's were so real based on the movies they usually star in. I thought it was fantastic that we saw more of Willis and Schwarzenegger and i have never seen such a great compilation of characters. The only downside is that the movie had to end! I really hope they bring out a third movie and if i can advise anything i suggest you see this in the cinema as it is fantastic on the big screen. Im now dying for the DVD to be released because i will definitely be buying it!,10,3,19,17 August 2012
