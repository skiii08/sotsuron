Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," George Lucas should have hired a couple of Professional Writers!
","The Queen was gorgeous and the little boy could not have been cuter.  The scenery and effects were beautiful.  All of the actors did a fine job with what there was to work with.  George Lucas' dream come true saga has everyone talking.  From what I saw he put forward a tremendous effort in all except the writing.  I am not a professional writer but Hollywood is crawling with them!  If you spent ~ $120 million making the dream come true, you should have budgeted in a million or two for writers.  I have seen better plots on half-hour sitcoms and I'm accustomed to more clever dialog from my buddies at work.  Honestly, my ten-year-old could write a better story; I'll correct the grammar for free.  I apologize for being so critical, after all, maybe it's just supposed to read like a comic book.  If that's the caseÂ… BIFF, BAM, POW!  You were right on the mark.",6,0,1,28 May 1999
