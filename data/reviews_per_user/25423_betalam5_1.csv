The Devil's Advocate," Worst acting performance ever
","I've seen hundreds and hundreds of films, but never have I seen a worse acting performance than that delivered by Keanu Reeves in 'The Devil's Advocate.'  Keanu's accent represents just a smidgen of his badness: In some scenes, he employs an atrocious 'southern' accent; in others, he loses the accent altogether.This demonstrates further what a fantastic job the creators of 'The Matrix' did: They not only produced an excellent film, but they also negated the Keanu factor.  Sorry, bro -- you need to stop playing southern lawyers and stick to the characters who go, 'Whoa!'",2,7,18,19 October 2002
