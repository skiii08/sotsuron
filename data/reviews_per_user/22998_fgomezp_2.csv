Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Way too overrated
","I went to see this movie yesterday. Under normal circumstances I would have given to it a 7. The only reason I am giving a 6 is because I feel that this film is way too overrated. Sure, it is a very funny movie and some of the jokes made me laugh really badly (though I must also admit that some of the same jokes might be a offensive for people of Muslim background, like some of my friends). But, does this make this movie deserve a spot in the top 250 movies of all time (according to the IMDb ratings as good as Twelve Monkeys or Shrek)? I don't think so at all. This is a '7' movie which will soon be forgotten, not one of the best movies ever made.",6,5,11,19 November 2006
Superbad," The most overrated movie of the year
","Seriously, when the movie came out this summer, with all the hype, I kind of felt bad that I didn't watch it on the theaters. I wondered whether it had been wise to pass on it. I just watched it on DVD-Netflix and all I can say that I am proud I didn't waste my money watching the movie when it came.It's an OK movie, funny, but certainly it doesn't deserve the amount of critical and public praise it is getting. 10 years (not to say 50 years!) from now people will look back and ask what were all those critics of Rotten Potatoes smoking when they were writing their reviews.",5,3,12,11 December 2007
