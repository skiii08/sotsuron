The Blair Witch Project," Brilliant marketing of a below-par movie
","I had high hopes for this film.  The use of the documentary camera to set the perspective was interesting, and the true-to-life characters broke the artificial molds that Hollywood usually tosses us.  Unfortunately, marginal story development/execution gradually tanked the film. Blair Witch was certainly creative and unique, but this alone combined with a scary premise and a low budget does not necessarily yield 'quality'.  Some of the folks unfamiliar with art / experimental films have found theirselves without a benchmark and have aligned themselves loosely along this film's marketing efforts. Unfortunately, conformity to consumerism and to the marketing establishment often seems to define quality in our culture, so now this film is being touted as 'excellent'. Not by me.  I will wait patiently for a better film.",3,0,2,24 August 1999
Fight Club," Good start, mediocre followthrough
","Consumerism is a mentality espoused by corporations and the American media that teaches us to embrace advertising and marketing, and to spend money frequently on frivolous, trendy merchandise from multinational corporations rather than buy locally, save, or spend wisely.  Consumerism is very much an addiction: we endlessly buy worthless junk and status symbols to find happiness; spending is spiritual and shopping malls are the temples. Fight Club, surprisingly, recognizes and sketches this premise out on a magnificent scale (shocking considering this was released by Fox).  Our main character is a slave to the corporate machine and spends his money on trinkets and trendy furniture.  His spiritual quest for happiness leads him to support groups and finally, in an odd turn of events, to fighting, which although providing a temporary high, takes our characters to rock bottom.  At that point the suspension of disbelief unravels and the film wanders, tossing the audience a lame succession of improbable conspiracies, psychologies, and ridiculous plot twists (essentially turning into 'The Game').  Sorry, I don't buy it.",Null,0,1,5 June 2000
