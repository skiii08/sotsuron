It," Pretty good Movie!
",Really Good Film. It didn't hold back on the dark themes of the novel. It was creepy and quite gory at times. I loved the opening sequence with Georgie. It was well directed and the acting was good from the young actors. I'm glad that I finally got around to watching it. 7/10,7,0,1,1 November 2018

Another Good Tarantino Flick. I do believe that death proof is better.",6,0,1,27 April 2020
Dawn of the Dead," Great
",This great zombie remake worthy for the original. It's still Zack Snyder best film to date in my opinion. James Gunn done a great job with the screen play. I like it because it pays tribute to the original and don't copy it Scene by Scene. It still holds up today the remake even when it came out in 2004. They also picked great songs to put into the film. Johnny cash & Disturbed. Even they done a good job with the end credits. 2004 has two of the great zombie films which came out in that year with Shaun of the dead & the remake of dawn of the dead. I never get bored re watching the remake. I loved the cameos from the actors who was in the original dawn of the dead. That was a nice nod.,8,1,1,15 June 2018

Léon: The Professional," Great Movie!
",I absolutely love this underrated movie by Luc Besson The cinematography in this film is absolutely beautiful. Great acting & great characters. It's very character driven story which I love about Leon. Jean Reno was fantastic as Leon. Very complex and loving character. I loved his friendship with Matilda. Gary Oldman was fantastic as well. Natalie Portman absolutely knocked it out of the park with her performance as Matilda. Can't believe this was her first film role. Sucks that they didn't do a sequel about matilda grown up. Classic film. 8/10,8,0,1,22 January 2019

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Guilty Pleasure!
","4/10
The CGI looks so bad now! It had some awesome moments. The female terminator was hot! I remember watching it at the cinema back in 2003! It's definitely a bad movie but it's not the worst film in the terminator franchise! T3 is a guilty pleasure movie!",4,0,3,25 December 2019
Van Helsing," Cheesy but fun!
","Van Helsing is just a fun,cheesy popcorn movie. Some of the cgi effects looks dated now. It's still a fun watch in 2019. I thought this version of Dracula was abit weak init they could of done more with the Dracula character. Kate Beckinsale was hot init. Most of the action sequences was quite good. I loved Van Helsing crossbow style gun. Sucks we didn't get to see a sequel. I had fun still watching Van Helsing again. 6/10",6,2,3,7 April 2019
Climax," Very bizarre!!
",Climax is one of the most weirdest film I have ever seen. The plot was terrible. The acting was all over the place. The cinematography was beautiful but that didn't make the film any good. I definitely wouldn't watch it again. One time watch most definitely. Very strange Film. 2/10,2,51,104,25 January 2019
The Transporter," Entertaining as hell!
",Silly but fun action flick. Very enjoyable! 7/10 A must see for any action lovers,7,0,0,22 April 2019
The Lion King," Hasn't got a patch on the original!
",Can't believe they ruined the classic songs from the original! Very unnecessary live action remake! The visual effects was amazing & beautiful. Can't believe they ruined scar's be prepared song! It was awful! Jeremy Irons will always be the voice of scar in my opinion! The problem with this version is that there wasn't no emotions on the characters faces like there was in the animation original version. This version is a one time watch for me. I will always love the original lion king! 4/10,4,1,1,25 March 2020
