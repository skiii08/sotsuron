Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Very depressing and sad.
","Borat is a brilliant and funny movie but it's also very depressing and sad. It portrays the Americans just like they are: drunkards, retards, homophobic, obese, fanatical, racist and very very paranoid. Just review the rodeo sequences, the preachers sequence (those preachers always frighten me 'cuz they turn people intro obedient sheep), the sequence with the frat kids (i actually thought that that scene was fake but i found out that actually it wasn't, and that's very sad 'cuz those kids are really f-ed up).It's depressing 'cuz people like these Americans portrayed in the movie exist and that makes me ashamed to be on the same planet as them. And, as always, Pamela is such a nice presence and i highly appreciated her being in this movie. She's got a great sense of humor and is funny as hell. Also, she's pretty hot. All in all, i'm happy this movie got made and that the Americans got what they deserved and that i also got to laugh a little. Great movie. Just great.",10,1,13,17 December 2006

Carrie," YUM!
","this film is one of those films that kinda gives you shivers...Sissy Spacek was great in this movie. She portrayed Carrie very-very-very well. Although not a 100% horror movie, 'Carrie' has a lot of MOM-TERROR in it. i'd kill myself instantly if i had Margaret White as my mom! All-in-all, 'Carrie' is one of the most disturbing films ever made.",10,4,6,7 January 2003
