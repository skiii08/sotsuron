The Equalizer," Tired old generic formula
","Yet again a movie about a lone (american) man that saves the day and kills all the (foreign) bad guys. OMG Hollywood this again. Who writes this crap. Seen it a million times before. Back in the day it was still cool but now just shameless.Cliché after cliché, no humor, virtually no story, illogical, plot holes, action is somewhat enjoyableTo my shame i must admit i enjoyed some of the mindless action scenes but the biggest problem is that it is all to far fetched. Without any realistic basis it just looks stupid. Denzel isn't helping either. Don't get me wrong i like Denzel and credits to him for trying, but his (over) acting feels out of place. He is just trying to hard and way to serious in a movie you can't take serious.",4,48,98,12 December 2014
John Wick," Contender for worst movie of 2014
",One-dimensional story: check. One-dimensional characters: check. Terrible dialogue: check. Bad acting: check. Uninspired action scenes: check.I checked IMDb before watching this. People talking about how this is going to be a new cult classic or the revival of Keanu. WTF are you people on crack or something. It was terrible from start to finish! This movie is all about the action and even that feels completely generic and uninspired. The dialogue is just plain painful to watch. I actually felt shame for the people 'acting' on screen. The story...... what story? It's virtually non-existent. Every random person you find on the street can write something better than this.The only thing going for this movie is Keanu looks cool. Even when his acting sucks.,1,115,236,16 January 2015
Interstellar," Beautifully crafted movie that tries to hard to be smart and looks stupid doing so
","If the underlying logic is missing, the story overly simplistic and weak, then spending 160 million on production isn't going to make it a great movie. The potential is huge but the end result feels lacking. This may well could have been a real masterpiece with a bit more thoughtfulness and work. It has some interesting science wrapped around a meager plot. It may well have sky high ambitions, very good production value, actors and cgi but the underlying script is just very weak. It lacks even the most basic logic. How this can be considered as intelligent and philosophical is beyond me.The science is heavily dumbed-down and simplified, presumably to appeal to a wide audience. The overall script is extremely simplistic. The philosophical aspect shallow and empty. The whole is wrapped into a fantastic presentation but ultimately a hollow experience.Matt Damon gives his worst performance to date (blame the script). Anne Hathaway looks lost the entire time and completely out of place. Matthew Mcconaughey flies the spacecraft like hes doing arcade games, the only thing missing is the occasional 'yeahaaaa!' like a cowboy.I applaud the ambition but overall it's a mess. A mess with silver linings. BUT STILL WORTH THE WATCH.",6,5,10,20 April 2015
Ex Machina," Falls just a bit short.....
","Hardly any excitement/suspense. For the most part nothing really happens besides talking for almost 2 hours. It's all a bit flat. The scary moments never get really scary. The drama is never really dramatic. The emotions never really engaging. The location not all that exciting. The atmosphere a bit sterile. The plot twists are a bit predictable. The main actor (Caleb) never really convincing. However i did like the other two main actors, especially Nathan (the creator). They both did a fine job. The conversations between Caleb and Ava are very subtle and nicely done but there is simply too much of it.It all falls just a bit short. It is by no means a bad movie but it's missing some spice. This could have been so much more. Sadly the potential is wasted.All in all it feels a bit like drinking lukewarm beer. It has all the ingredients to make it good but it's missing something...",6,7,16,17 May 2015
