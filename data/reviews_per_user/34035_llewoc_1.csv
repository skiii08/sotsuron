Lucky Number Slevin," Grest, Great, Great
","For a chick who hates blood, cussing and extreme violence this movie was probably the last type of movie I would choose to go see if I had been aware of the genre. My husband bought home the DVD and stuck it on and I before I even had time to look over the cover I was deeply immersed in the plot and Josh of course. What a great movie and proving once again it's often the ones that sneak onto the screen that make no fuss that are the most interesting and special (ie. 28 Days later). The cast were all perfect in their roles but I especially enjoyed Josh H. who looked absolutely irresistible with his broken nose, Bruce Willis who never fails to disappoint and Lucy Lui who was very natural in this role. The way the film was shot was also interesting and not your usual slick, Hollywood palate pleaser stuff. An interesting approach, a clever plot and an absolutely fantastic cast. Go and see it if you like to think outside the box a little!!!",Null,1,3,7 November 2006
