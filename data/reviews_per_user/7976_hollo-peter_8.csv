Sucker Punch," Zack Snyder's CGI fest for 2011
","I think the reviews focus too much on the film being targeted at male audiences only due to the overwhelming presence of beautiful young girls in their twenties. It is true, but it is the visual effect 'orgy' that really steals the show.The plot is very simple: a young girl is sent to a medical facility after confronting her stepfather in a violent way at home - she realizes the institution will be the end of her, therefore she immediately decides to come up with a plan in order to escape; which of course involves becoming friends with the rest of the girls inside the facility.All the fantasy scenes we see - that comprise 'zombie' Nazis, dragons, giant samurai and so on - are part of an alternative reality she escapes to in order to cope with the system. The battles are getting greater and greater; we can really feel the tension building up as well as how desperately she wants to escape.Now, this is yet another Zack Snyder film (the director of 300) that focuses solely on the action. Well, I believe he also wished to make us see the development of the girls' relationship with one another, but it all just gets lost in the maze of computer generated images.Sucker Punch is a 110-minute ride that comes to an abrupt stop. The ending was somewhat disappointing for me, yet, the overall experience was satisfactory. And yes, there were pretty girls in their twenties there, too...",7,1,3,4 September 2011
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Thrilling, tenacious, superb, stylish
","Our film - which belongs to the genre of espionage - takes place in the '70s during the Cold War. At the beginning we see a failed operation which attempted to reveal the identity of a mole (a Russian agent working for the British Intelligence Service undercover).Gary Oldman plays Mr Smiley who is called back just after retirement to investigate the matter and find out the true identity of the man in question. The stakes are quite high as Mr Control - played by the talented John Hurt - outlines that the suspects are all the senior members of the service. While at it, Smiley looks for a rogue agent who might have vital information in finding the criminal responsible for the fiasco in Budapest. The films incorporates some superb actors along with features you hardly see in such films full of agents. There are no amazing fistfights here, no red sports cars, spectacular shoot-outs, excessive use of CGI, naked women and dry martini (shaken, not stirred!).It's all about discussions, investigation, deception, cowardice, suspicion, Budapest-Paris-London in the 70s, huge, horn-rimmed glasses, big, gray coats, mistrust, some more talking, some more conspiring and some more disbelief.A very good mixture of cast makes sure that you enjoy all 120 minutes of Tinker, Tailer, Soldier, Spy. I'll give it a solid 8 out of 10 and no I have not ready the book nor have I seen the original TV-show.",8,1,2,20 January 2012
Drive," A shame such films are considered a 'masterpiece of cinema'
","Ryan Gosling is a stunt driver / wheel man / worker in a garage who suddenly feels empathy because his neighbour's incarcerated husband is released and returns home. Why the empathy and the helping hand? Because he gets beaten and is kindly asked to re-pay his previous employers for the service they'd provided him with while in prison (they want the protection money with, of course, interests).Things go from bad to worse and Ryan suddenly becomes the overprotective neighbour; the hero who saves the day by going after the bad guys one- by-one. At this point the film's slow pace quickly changes and while it'd normally take time to enjoy the different circumstances the creators made sure I got disgusted by Drive's gruesome handling of every situation where two enemies meet.This film is full of gore. Ryan's one liners make it even worse. Oh, but wait, sometimes he smiles! There is no need to say anything; a smile can really tell you everything. Drive is an awful film: from start to finish; it's pacing, the plot, the characters (development?) and an unsatisfactory ending that cries out for a better screenplay.It is a shame such a movie is given high rates. It is OK if you don't want to follow the good-old clich√©s and if you want to try out something different. It is OK if you employ techniques, effects, cinematography that keep the audience focused. It is NOT, good, however, if you go off the beaten track. Perhaps, next time more emphasis will be on the plot and less on the excessive use of violence.",3,2,6,20 January 2012
Into the Wild," A captivating drama from 2007.
","Emily Hirsch stars as the guy who decides to leave society after graduation. He leaves everything behind: family, friends, belongings; burns his ID cards and even gives the money on his savings account to a charity foundation.You'd think the guy is a rebellious man about to give society a lesson. No, that's not the case. Surely he was not brought up by the most lovable parents in the world, but he was properly raised and he managed to get top grades at college; all the prerequisites of making a career have been met.Yet, he decides to go into the wild. All the stuff he has are essential for his survival: clothes for each coming season, weapons to hunt animals and books; famous works of famous authors let each and every day pass in a way one can only consider worthwhile.He meets various people upon his journey (hippies living on their own, also cut off from society, agricultural workers he joins to make some money, tourists from Denmark enjoying their free time whilst travelling the US, etc.), he befriends them, but eventually continues to prepare for the great journey: arriving to Alaska.Emily successfully portrays a man who got fed up with the people of modern society: divorce between parents, backstabbing friends, hypocrisy given to you by a great many people and also he sees the victims of the so-called consumer societies - people who want more of those things that come in the form of a mobile phone or a car or a house.Too bad the film takes place in the early '90s. One would think things have gotten better since that time but they have only gotten worse: our lives our encompassed by the internet, social networks and mobile phones - each of them is a means to be as 'far away' from people as possible while trying to maintain a social activity by creating fake behavioural patterns. This film would be perfect if it had been made recently.Regardless, it is a masterpiece cinema I can only recommend. Each character is lovable and although the film is slow-paced at times during its 150-minute run, it gives you a satisfactory journey (ending done well, likewise) and maybe, maybe makes you reinterpret your life.I give it 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,1 October 2011
Super 8," Spielberg's and Abrams' outstanding cooperation
","I remember being only one of the handful of people in Budapest who wanted to see this film in original version (i.e. English audio, no subtitles) on one hot Friday evening in the summer of 2011. It is a shame everything gets dubbed in cinemas in Hungary these days. Nevertheless, it is lucky for us that there is always a place somewhere in the capital where the theatre shows American films in the form they were intended to be presented to the audience.The movie takes place in 1979, if I am not mistaken. As one could expect from Mr Spielberg the era is presented meticulously. Movie posters here and there, kid listening to his Walkman, old cars driven on the streets and of course the children trying to shoot their dream movie with the use of a Super 8 camera.I do not remember when was the last time I saw children acting superbly. Although the main character's father, the deputy in the town, has a vital role, as well, he is not in the focus and we are more interested in seeing the kids' struggle to finish the film even after the derailment of a train and the subsequent appearance of the US Air Force.I am not lying to you: I was afraid Spielberg would not be enough to make it a successful movie and J.J Abrams would only mess up the story. If you think about it: Cloverfeld meets the Extra Terrestrial? Come on!Yet, it works! It is a wonderful piece of work which, yes, most of the time reminds us of the small alien who wanted to go home but it's been almost 30 years since then so should it really be a concern that someone tries to borrow elements from a successful movie?I was stuck to my seat the whole time and was eagerly waiting for the end of a wonderful journey. If you did not like the trailer there is no point in ruining your evening. However, if you did like it and E.T. was something that makes you remember your childhood vividly, give it a try, you will not regret it!I give it a solid 8 out of 10. Well done, guys! Hope to see the result of your further cooperation sometime in the future.",8,120,184,26 June 2011
Thor," Thor is a visually stunning comic book adaptation
","I did not expect this to be a classic. Or at least not in the way Superman became a classic more than 30 years ago. I believe it was entertaining enough, thus, to call Thor an 'ersatz' (a replacement product) by some of the finest movie reviewers out there is simply nonsense.The film entertains from start to finish; the main character - Thor - is cast out after an 'incident' which enrages his father, the so-called Allfather (present ruler / king of the magical world called Asgard). Thor has to make do with the Earth 'realm' while his friends try to reach out to him; in the meantime, Thor's sinister brother is plotting in order to become the next king.It was strange to see Natalie Portman in a supporting role in a 'popcorn' flick - same goes for Skellan Skarsgard, but they both are perfect fits. The muscled guy who plays Thor is fine and Anthony Hopkins is as good as ever. Loki - Thor's brother and arch nemesis, too - is not the usual type you would pick for a bad guy - does not really come out in the open till the very end, until then it's all about mischief and cunning.Of all the comic book adaptations this year Thor has been the best - it was exactly what I expected to see and again the post-credits scene hinted a bit of a story of the upcoming 'The Avengers'. Thor - I beg your pardon, dear journalist - is far from being an ersatz: it is - at times - dull, and focuses only on the action, but it is an enjoyable ride until the next classic comes out.It deserves a solid 8 out of 10.",8,4,8,4 September 2011
X-Men: First Class," Definitely refreshing after the disastrous Wolverine
","My summary pretty much says it all: if you have watched all previous X-Men movies and you watched Wolverine the last I assume it was a huge disappointment. Even the 3rd one (X-Men: The Last Stand) was remarkable considering the complete change in staff; particular emphasis on the director.Anything, really, anything could have been much better than Wolverine, but no, the creators went even further and they managed to write a decent script and hire a very decent cast (we really should look forward to Mr McAvoy's and Fassbender's future roles).Although both Magneto's and Xavier's character are very good, it is definitely the bad guy (played by Kevin Bacon) who steals the entire show. From start to finish Kevin's acting is extraordinary - he even shows off by speaking fluently in German and Russian.I could go on listing the film's pros but I think it is not necessary. X-Men: First Class is highly recommended for all the avid X-Men fans out there; in fact, as it is a prequel, even those trying the familiarise themselves with the franchise for the first time can watch it before the rest. That is, of course, by leaving out the 4th installment which was the biggest letdown in the history of all the comic book adaptations.I give it a solid 8 out of 10.",8,0,3,27 June 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Excellent finish for an excellent franchise
","Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the third and final installment of Michael Bay's Transformers franchise. Viewers had to wait 2 years for this sequel just like they did in case of the 2nd one. The question is: Was it worth it? Did the movie live up to its expectations? (Obviously, expectations were set by the people who did not become haters after watching the first two.) Well, it's a yes and no. In the main areas where we expect Transformers to do its job, the film excels. That is, visual effects, fun (and yes, I mean fun, laughter, because Agent Simmons and the Witwicky parents do their job for the 3rd time and also it's fun to watch Shia arguing with Bumblebee), heroic scenes, great villains and top notch voice acting (Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime is just superior, and thanks for Leonard Nimoy, too).We see some great cameos just like in the previous film. John Malkovich, Frances McDormand appear and those who liked Hangover will be happy to see the Chinese gangster. Alan Tudyk was silly but a necessary addition to Simmons' character.And it's a no because there is just so much action in 150 minutes that there's no time to elaborate the characters' stories - including not only the new ones but good-old' Witwicky and pretty much the rest.So why did I give it 9 out of 10? Because I am capable of realising that a movie that has a 2 and a half minute-long trailer full of explosions just like its predecessors sums up the film for the 3rd time and tells you what exactly you can expect: a lot of explosions.If you have not watched the cartoon made in the 80's you'll not see the small references to it. You will not be relieved to hear Peter Cullen talk. If you want to see a film with the caliber of the King's Speech or The Godfather you will not appreciate the modest acting present in Transformers.The 2nd film definitely had its flaws but Mr Bay fantastically ended the story. I give the film a solid 9 out of 10 because I can value Transformers for what it really is: an entertaining summer blockbuster movie fully utilising today's technology in terms of audio and visual effects.",9,2,4,1 July 2011
