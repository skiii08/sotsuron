The Sound of Music," The best hollywood film ever made.
",Being a throughbred Indian I generally only watch Indian films. But this is an non Indian film that I can watch more than even 100 times if possible. The music score is the best for any 'American' film. The story line is simple and sweet. This film is one any one can watch from a 5 year old to a 90 year old,10,1,7,6 June 2000
