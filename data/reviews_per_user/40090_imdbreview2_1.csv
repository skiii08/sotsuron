United 93," Ridiculous, a Total Work of Fiction
","The makers of this film know about as much about what happened on that day as I do, which is next to nothing. We really don't even know for certain if anyone on that plane brought it down. If you really think about it, how incompetent would the military have to be to let this plane even approach Washington. Two planes had already crashed in New York. They had plenty of time to intercept this plane.A jumbo jet travels substantially slower than the speed of sound. Fighter jets can travel at Mach 2. Even if they didn't shoot it down, I would think it would have been shot down before it ever reached Washington. But if you think about it for a second, what better PR stunt for Washington is there than a 'heroic' crew taking down a plane to save Washington. People, you're watching a PR stunt gone totally out of control. Some people have too much patriotism and too little common sense.As I see it there are 3 possible reasons the plane went down. Either the hijackers brought it down, the passengers took control and couldn't handle it, or it was shot down. Any way you slice it, I don't think the passengers did anything heroic per se. They tried to save their own lives but were unable to succeed. Brave, maybe. Heroic, no. The passengers took action to save their lives only when they knew it would be hopeless otherwise. Their actions were rational in their attempts at self-preservation. But it would be incredibly naive or incredibly patriotic (same thing) to view their actions as any attempt to 'save Washington.' People who think that need to get a grip.For the above reasons, this movie is simply a plane hijacking flick. Nothing more, nothing less. It certainly was not a good action flick. If you want to see a movie overflowing with fear and human emotion, this is the one for you. Just don't let that emotion get the better of you. This is a work of fiction, very loosely based on the events of that day.",1,49,121,29 April 2006
