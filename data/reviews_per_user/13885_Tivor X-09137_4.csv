The Rock," Great cast makes this cool action-flick exceptional.
","This is easily one of the most satisfying action flick of all time.  The plot was decent, action was intense (it's got one of the most memorable car chase scene), and the music is one of the coolest ever.  But the real reason why I give this movie a perfect score of 10 is its wonderful cast.The rather far-fetched motive of General Hummel was so well rendered with conviction by Ed Harris that the audience won't care that it's the lamest excuse anyone has ever come up with to hold a whole city hostage to a deadly chemical weapon.  I mean, the cause itself is noble, but threatening to kill millions with the VX gas??  Even for a bluff, it was pretty lame.  But did I care?  Ed Harris is so overflowing with authority and charisma that I might follow his orders even without the promise of million bucks pay.And the chemistry between Nick Cage and Sean Connery is magical; you just gotta love the dialogue between the two.  All the one-liners and witty comebacks that could sound extremely cheesy by lesser actors are delivered to perfection.  And that little remark about John Mason (Sean Connery) being trained by the best -- the British Intelligence -- brought back the memories of James Bond.  Gotta love it.Even the supporting cast was wonderful at their roles.  The mercenary marines were especially cool in their crazed bloodlust.  And Commander Anderson, played by Michael Biehn, was simply amazing.  I mean, there wasn't a single lame actor who took me out of my suspended disbelief.It ain't a movie that'll make you cry or think or whatever.  This is a pure entertainment movie.  A great action movie cooked to perfection.  Action flicks don't get much better than this.",10,1,1,11 March 2000
The Ring," Great Americanized remake of the Japanese horror
","I watched the original Japanese 'Ring' (aka 'Ringu,' as per the Japanese phonetic) two years ago.  It was a very freaky film, to say the least. So when I learned that a remake of the film was being released here in the States, I had to see it.  I was curious to know if the American filmmakers were going to improve upon the original, or totally screw it up by 'Americanizing' it.Well, I'm glad to say that they mostly succeeded.  After the opening sequence which was a virtual carbon copy of the Japanese original, the movie improved upon the original in many ways.  There were some plot changes, but most had to do with Americanizing the characters, their relations, and their background.  The writers did a great job of only Americanizing the setting while keeping the core plot elements and themes intact.  (Personally, I really enjoyed the Seattle apartment complex which Naomi Watt's character lives in because the buildings looked decidedly more Japanese than American. :D )  Furthermore, there were some additional scenes and freaky stuff that I don't remember seeing in the Japanese original.  Those new stuff and the Hollywood production value did a good job of improving the movie.  The acting was pretty good too.  Definitely more compelling than the Japanese version, IMHO.Unfortunately, I was let down by the climactic ending of the movie. Naturally, I will not spoil the movie for you by going into details.  But let me just say that I found the Japanese ending to be ten times more freaky (and memorable!) than the American one.  In terms of the plot, the endings are practically the same, but how the scene was executed was different. I feel that the Japanese ending was more tightly directed and more freaky as a result, compared to the slightly self-indulgent 'ooh, isn't this scary' American rendition of the same scene.But apparently, I felt that way only because I had watched the original. There were plenty of girls screaming and guys yelling 'Holy $#!+' in the theater, and my cousin (who had not watched the Japanese original) was very freaked out too.  I was definitely among the minority.All in all, I think 'The Ring' is a great remake of the Japanese original. Even though I personally feel that they somewhat botched the ending (probably only because I'm comparing it to the Japanese original, which most people probably haven't even heard of anyways), the American version successfully brings the feel of the Japanese occult and horror to the American moviegoers.  It definitely ain't your usual hack-and-slash cheese-and-sleaze gore-horror flick.  It's a great, great movie for the Halloween season, and I expect it to enjoy a long, happy life at the box office.Oh, as a side note, while watching David Letterman the other night, I learned that Naomi Watts (the leading actress) went to the same high school with Nicole Kidman in Australia.  Maybe that's why Naomi has same facial expression things going on as Nicole.  I thought it was very interesting. I wonder if I'm the only one who saw that.  :)",8,0,0,19 October 2002
8 Mile," Surprisingly good. Much Kudos to the director Curtis Hanson.
","﻿I am one of those people who dismissed '8 Mile' simply because it was an Eminem movie.  I really don't care for Eminem, and I really don't much care for the current hip hop in general either.  But what can I say? All my friends wanted to watch it, so I ended up watching it with them.  And guess what?  I liked it.All the cast, including Eminem, are uniformly excellent, and I really have to give lots of kudos to the director Curtis Hanson (who has also directed much-acclaimed 'L.A. Confidential').  He managed to capture the ever-so-subtle glint of defeat from Eminem's eyes in the beginning sequence of the movie, as well as the just-as-subtle glint of triumph near the end. I'm sure Eminem possesses the natural instinct and screen presence to be a good actor (especially in a role that should be familiar to him), but I doubt that he would have been as impressive as he was in '8 Mile' without Curtis Hanson guiding him.  And Kim Basinger (who won an Oscar for her performance in Curtis Hanson's 'L.A. Confidential') shows us once again that she is as compelling an actress as she is beautiful.Plot-wise, there really isn't anything new here.  It's a 'boy faces the obstacles in his life, finds his own path, and becomes a man' story.  It's almost formulaic in a sense.  In fact, I think this movie could have been extremely predictable and boring, if it weren't for Curtis Hanson's wonderful direction and the subsequently excellent performances of the cast.To sum it up, if you're an Eminem fan, then by all means watch '8 Mile.' (Like I need to tell them)  Although one of my friend said that he wished there were even more rhymin', I doubt fans would be disappointed.  And if you're not a fan (of Eminem or hip hop in general), I still suggest that you consider watching this movie.  It's a very decent drama, at the very least. Definitely not some movie to be dismissed simply because a rapper is in it. Good stuff.",7,0,1,10 November 2002
WALL·E," Absolutely magical
","This is by far the BEST movie that Pixar has ever made, hands-down. If WALL-E is a 5-star movie, then all other Pixar movies are 4-star movies in comparison. It is that magical.A big part of the magic comes from the fact that the two main characters, robots Wall-E and Eve, barely speak more than one word at a time. Just about all their lines can be written with just one of these three words: 'Wall-E,' 'Eve,' and 'Directive.' Despite that, through excellent animation and wondrous voice direction, the audience is always aware of exactly what those two robots are thinking and feeling every second.Now, I love movies with good dialogue, and we all love witty banters between characters. But by their very nature, language -- especially the witty sort -- requires intellectual interpretation before it can appeal to the audience's emotions. By minimizing the role of language in portraying the relationship between the two robots, Pixar has gone straight to our emotions, and they have succeeded magnificently.Of course, that's not to say that the movie is only about sappy emotions. The movie also makes a lot of satirical fun at everything from global corporation (everything is Buy n Large, and there is no sign of US government, or any government for that matter), environmentally irresponsible consumerism, cellphone- and television-addicted culture, lethargic and obese general public (and commercial billboards that portray fit models), internet generation who don't know what a book is (and think that pizza grows on trees), so on and so forth. Plus, there is also a pretty refreshing gender role/stereotype reversal between Wall-E and Eve, especially near the end.Visually, the movie is breathtaking. Particularly of note are the smoke and particle effects, like the scene early in the movie where Wall-E finds a fire extinguisher. Jawdroppingly beautiful and realistic. It makes you want to pull out all other movies with CG smoke effects and yell 'FAKE!!' at them. It's amazing how Pixar keeps on finding ways to push the 3D CG envelope.It is not often that a movie exceeds my highest of expectations, and WALL-E did with ease. You can be sure that before the theatrical run is over, I'll be watching this movie at least one more time. And then I'll get it when it's released on Bluray. I do not say this often, but this movie is, without a shred of doubt, a true classic.",10,4,8,29 June 2008
