Blade Runner 2049," 2049.
","Denis Villeneuve's suitably ambient, and stylised sequel to Ridley Scott's Sci-Fi masterpiece Blade Runner.Hans Zimmer's score is beautiful, that perfectly compliments Vangelis's original.A fitting conclusion.",10,1,11,14 December 2019
Alien," Alien.
","At 12 years old, my father handed me the book version of Alien, by Alan Dean Foster. I remember him chuckling and telling me I'd like it. Once I started reading, I became absorbed by it. My father was right. This was the year the film was released, and at 12, there was no way of going to see it. So I became obsessed with getting to see it. After the film was released, I stumbled upon the photo book The Making Of Alien, and after finally seeing H.R. Giger's creations, I was completely blown away.Alien is a tightrope of tension and fear. It's the most atmospheric movie I have ever seen. All of the cast are solid in their roles. Ridley Scott and crew did an amazing job of recreating H.R.Giger's designs, and Scott's direction is flawless throughout. The set designs inside the Nostromo, and the gritty 'space truckers' feel of the film, add to the realism. Which makes for a great contrast when they finally discover the alien derelict, with it's nasty surprises.John Williams's score is amazing. Suitably dark and bleak, with just a glimmer of hope.So, from a 12 year old's crush, and to finally seeing it a few years later, I can say with ease, Alien is without doubt, my favourite film.Total perfection.",10,3,5,17 November 2019
Taxi Driver," TRUE force.
","Martin Scorcese's and Robert De Niro's tour de force, Taxi Driver charts the decent into insanity of ex-war vet Travis Bickle, who's working as a cab driver, who brings his own, personal vendetta to the streets of 70's downtrodden New York. Scorcese's direction, and Bernard Herrmann's score create great tension and foreboding throughout. And De Niro's Bickle is played tautly, portraying a damaged mind about to snap.Taxi Driver is a tightly-wound psychological character study. And classic Scorcese.",9,0,0,14 December 2019
The Thing," You gotta be fu**in' kidding.
","This was the first adult rated movie I snuck in to see at the cinema. At age 14, as I'm sure many of you have also experienced on your first viewing, this movie was mind blowing. And it still runs rings around the recent prequel (remake), proving that practical effects can be way more disturbing and effectual, than CGI.And great score by Ennio Morricone.Class Sci-Fi/Horror.",9,1,1,8 December 2019
Midsommar," Laughably bad.
","I felt embarrassed for all the actors, and extras in this film. This movie was completely and utterly ridiculous.This was a comedy right?",Null,2,9,25 February 2020
Joker," Majestic.
","There are moments here, where the lights in Joaquin Phoenix's / Arthur's eyes are so piercing, and so focused, that you are totally drawn into his performance and transformation into Joker. There are so many iconic scenes in this movie, so many, that, to me, make this film an instant classic.And that's what Joker is.",10,2,4,23 October 2019
Blade Runner," Sci-Fi perfection.
","Blade Runner is science fiction perfection, that holds important messages.Sleep well Roy x.",10,0,1,14 December 2019
