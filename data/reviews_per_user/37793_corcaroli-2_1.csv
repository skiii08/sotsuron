United 93," United 93 Convincing, Credible and Moving
","The Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences may well have to create a new category (Docudrama) to suitably honour Paul Greengrass and his achievements with United 93.Greengrass' thorough and meticulous research anchors the film's every scene, making it both convincing and credible. **He scored a coup as well to get so many air traffic control crews who were on duty that day at the Newark, New York / La Guardia and Logan airports to participate in his film. I was riveted to my theatre seat for the entire two hours-plus, including the credits, which I always watch -- wow! now I know why I do that...I knew from the beginning that this story had to be told; we on the outside needed to know what happened to the heroic souls on this plane, whose dire mission they thwarted. 9/11 was the 'ultimate history class' for my 20th Century world history students - far more important, just then, than the causes of WWI. We dashed that morning to the student lounge at my school and fired up the TV, alternating between CNN's and MSNBC's coverage. Every one of them now understands-and will never forget-why studying history is important: because 'history' can happen at any time.Congratulations and my thanks to Paul Greengrass, his crew, and a splendid cast of 'unknowns' for a superb rendition of the events of this flight, and a moving tribute to the people caught up in the events of 9/11, both the living and the dead. I predict this film will become 'the classic' story of this event for present and future generations.===== ** Your decision as to whether this sentence qualifies as a 'spoiler'. To me,knowing this boosted the authenticity of the movie, and my enjoyment of it, 100% . Feel free to delete it if you wish. CS",9,2,4,4 May 2006
