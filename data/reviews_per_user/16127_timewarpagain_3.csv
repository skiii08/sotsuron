The Blair Witch Project," Not scary before the last 10 minutes...
","I had heard so much about 'The Blair Witch Project', and I was expecting a really scary movie, that would destroy my sleep for days.But what is it? A bunch of stupid wanna-be-filmmakers, walking around saying nothing but s**t or f**k, finding some piles of rocks in the forrest. One of the students accidentley destroys one of these piles, and after that something mysterical is happening. The tent they are sleeping in start shaking, they find piles of rocks outside their tent, one of them are being tortured.But the reaseon I don't give this movie a high grade is that it takes too long time before anything happens. Shaking cameras and awful language, yes, but nothing else.The only thing that scared me was the ending, when they find an empty house, running up and down in the stairs, and hears the voice from the tortured friend that disappeared earlier in the movie.The Blair Witch Project WILL scare you, no doubts about that, but I just think that it took to long time, and made me sigh several times.I give this movie more than 5 because of the acting, extremely believable.If you like psychological movies, see it!But I will look for something else.",7,1,2,26 September 2008
The Exorcist," The Godfather of all horror movies!
","Finally I saw this movie, that became one of the most chocking movies of all time. When The Exorcist was first released, a lot of cinemas had people vomiting, fainting and breaking into hysterics during the show.Never had a movie containing so much graphic violent been seen before. Never had a 12-year old girl scared people so much, as the fantastic Linda Blair, who makes a fantastic performance.The Special Effects in the movie doesn't seem old at all, at least not to me.The exorcist will haunt you for a very long time if you choose to see it, many of these scenes are extremely disturbing!9/10",10,4,6,26 September 2008
Halloween," It's scary.
","Halloween is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen! Mostly because of the music, the music in Halloween will haunt you whenever you are walking all by yourself. Halloween is also scary because of the lack of blood. The horror movies created today contains to much blood, too much special effects that clearly is made from a computer. Halloween doesn't contain that, it goes for pure horror instead, and deserves 8 stars! For example all the times Spoiler! Michael stalks the characters, the scene at the bush, or when he is standing outside the girls window. It is after all the starter of the slasher genre, and it is one of my 5 favourite movies ever made!",8,0,2,26 September 2008
