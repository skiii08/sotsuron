Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Journey worthwhile. Goal disappointing.
","Sometimes the journey is what matters, not the final goal. I loved waiting in line for 'The Phantom Menace' and letting the anticipation build. I was disappointed in the fact that this was the vision of one person and one person alone, and I think George Lucas needed someone to tell him that he was making some grievous errors. Lucas had a phenomenal plot outline, but the final result was a poorly written and poorly directed movie that unfortunately, led to poor acting. The visual bombardment of computer graphics was wearisome and overshadowed the character and story development. Trust in the story, George, not in the special effects.",7,0,0,19 May 1999
The Dark Knight," Verdict is not in for best movie of all time
","This film had a disjointed beginning, an excellent middle and a muddled ending. The fight scenes and chase sequences were choppily edited and Christian Bale lost way too much muscle for this outing - who wants a skinny Batman? The overall experience felt like watching a hastily edited version of a much longer film. It makes me think that there may very well be a longer director's cut offered when the DVD is released? I cannot go along with the majority and vote this film the number one movie of all time. It is too early to tell and this film deserves repeated viewings before making that judgment. A good film certainly, but not perfect.",8,1,2,22 July 2008
