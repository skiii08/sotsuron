Catch Me If You Can," Well worth catching
","This movie received a lot of hype when it came out, but I never got the chance to see it until this week (courtesy once again of the library, thank you very much). I'd heard good things about it, and I figured any film that involved Spielberg and hanks would be worth a look.The movie chronicles the story of Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), a young man who sees his father's (Christopher Walken) slow descent into poverty and decides to help him by applying his particular kind of genius into a bold but extremely clever fraud scheme. Frank is soon passing himself off as a pilot for TWA, and his schemes only get bolder from there. Assigned to catch him is determined Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who lacks Frank's brilliance but makes up for it with dogged persistence.The movie is very skillfully handled. Spielberg has a number of terrific shots sprinkled throughout (the moment where Carl realizes he's actually spoken with Frank and didn't know it is classic), and the feel of the 60s is deftly captured. DiCaprio really does look like he's fifteen or sixteen through most of it, and all of the small subtle period details are captured. We're also shown a great deal more than we are told; while Frank is a genius, we are never told that, but we see how his schemes unfold, part accident and part inspiration, and we come to sympathize with him even though he is a criminal. In fact it's a testament to the skill of the writing and directing that although the characters are at odds with one another and have conflicting goals, we can somehow root for them both.Hanks is his usual excellent self, and his Carl is a character we immediately like, even if he is a bit gruff around the edges. DiCaprio surprised me because he fits into the role seamlessly; I've never seen him be this natural or effective before, and it gave me new respect for him as an actor (he really needs to stay away from period stuff). His performance is the more important one, because naturally the bulk of the film centers on him. Christopher Walken is also very strong as Frank's father, a man whose life slowly crumbles beneath him yet who never gives up fighting for something better (it's never made clear if he did anything wrong in his past to elicit such attention from the IRS, which normally would be a drawback but in this case is oddly effective). The rest of the cast is excellent too, and Martin Sheen gives a nice turn in a smaller role.In the end we see that Frank really could have been someone amazing had he just buckled down and worked for it Â– that he did so well with so little is also a testament to his pluck and intelligence. But Spielberg and his cast manage to present an interesting and entertaining story that never lags and keeps us wrapped up in its twists and turns from start to finish. In the last few years Spielberg has made his share of lackluster films (AI, Minority Report) but Catch Me If You Can is not one of them. A strong effort from some gifted people at the top of their games, Catch  is certainly worth a rental. It's a little long at two and a half hours, but it's certainly worth the investment of your time.One minor note: John William's score is extremely effective and one of his better works in recent years. It marries perfectly to the visuals and is simply outstanding.June 6, 2004",9,1,2,6 June 2004
Friday Night Lights," A mediocre Varsity Blues
","I find football a far more interesting sport than baseball, but for some reason baseball gets much better films (there is no equivalent of The Natural or Field of Dreams for football. Football fans get crap like Rudy). Friday Night Lights, unfortunately, does nothing to break that tradition.The movie follows the book by Buzz Bissinger and touts to be based on a real story, but oddly enough for such claims the movie has less emotional impact than another movie I found similar, Varsity Blues. Lights follows the story of a high school football team from Odessa, Texas as they make their way to the state championship in 1988.The main problem with the film is that there's no central character. We're given a potentially interesting ensemble, but no one to connect with. Coach Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) isn't particularly deep; he's neither likable, like Gene Hackman from Hoosiers, nor talented but venal, like Robert Voight from Varsity Blues. He's just sort of there, in theory the leader of the team but actually having very little impact whatsoever (other than to broadcast the unorthodox ending). Likewise with players Mike (Lucas Black), Don (Garrett Hedlund), and Chavez (the almost always reliable Jay Hernandez); we get glimpses into their lives (well, okay, not Chavez's, at all) but only glimpses, not anything near enough to make them engaging characters. And what we are given is pretty rote: Mike has problems with his mother, who might or might not be losing her mind; Don's dad (country singer Tim McGraw) is an overbearing and often drunk former high school football star (which we saw done to far better effect, again, in Varsity Blues); and so on. We aren't given any meat to these characters, except for one guy, Boobie Miles (Derek Luke), and Boobie is such a jerk it's impossible to like him.The movie chronicles the team's 1988 season, taking them from their first game straight through to the championship. Most of the game footage is acceptable but not overly exciting, and we get no special sense of any player's skill or weaknesses. Only when we get to the final game in the Astrodome does the pace step up; the second half of the game is portrayed in vivid style, exciting, and the movie comes to life and becomes riveting for about fifteen minutes. But that's a really long buildup for so little payoff, even if the plot does go in a slightly unexpected direction at the very end.The performances are all adequate but hardly anything exciting. I was impressed by McGraw in one scene, where we find out why he is the way he is; but everyone else gives good solid performances. No one stands out, and no one is particularly bad. Firmly middle of the road.Although I should probably take this movie on its own merits, there are so many similarities to Varsity Blues (one wonders if they weren't inspired by Bissinger's book a little) that it's frankly hard not to make the comparison, and Blues does a much better job with almost the same material (including remembering to round out its principals into actual characters). Lights is only so-so; worth maybe a rental on a bored Friday night, though I'm not sorry I saw the final ball game. But it's a definite pass on the big screen. If you want to see this story told in a much more interesting and entertaining way, rent Varsity Blues.",3,10,20,10 October 2004
Madagascar," Light enjoyable movie but you could wait to rent it
","Madagascar follows the story of a pair of buddies in the NYC zoo, Alex, a lion (Ben Stiller) and Marty, a zebra (Chris Rock). Marty dreams of something more, while Alex is happy being the big attraction. When events take a turn for the worse, the two of them  along with a hypochondriac giraffe (David Schwimmer) and a saucy hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith)  find themselves accidentally shipped to  you guessed it  Madagascar.Though the movie largely concerns itself with the Alex/Marty buddy plot, the real humor is not in the main characters at all but in the goofy menagerie that inhabits the rest of the film. Chief among them are four semi-psychotic penguins who operate like a Navy Seals team; they're hysterical, goofy looking commandoes who can go 'cute and cuddly' on command. Even funnier than them, however, is the oddball narcissist king of the lemurs, Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen  aka Ali G), who is so self-absorbed and so warped he steals every scene he's in.Madagascar is okay. It's probably in the second run theaters by now, and that's a perfect place to see it. It's not bad, but the leads never really engage you; good thing the penguins and Julien are in it a fair amount. There are a few funny gags (one continuing one involving spitting out seawater actually gets funnier the more they do it), and overall the movie is light entertainment, but nothing more. Those curious could easily wait for the DVD.",4,3,4,11 July 2005
The Girl Next Door," We've seen this before
","'Girl' follows the story of one Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) as he encounters new girl next door Danielle (24's Elisha Cuthbert) and gets involved in her life. Turns out she's a porn star, which Matt's friend Eli (Chris Marquette) lets him in on. So naturally the movie takes several zany twists and turns, from the kids going to Vegas to stalk Danielle at a porn movie convention to Matt getting mixed up with Danielle's dangerous manager, Kelly (Timothy Olyphant). There are enough twists and turns to keep things lively, and enough laughs to entertain most of the time.Hirsch is effective as Matt; he plays his innocence well, and has enough young boy charm and good looks to win the viewer over. Cuthbert, resembling here a sexier, more beautiful version of a young Debby Harry, is also fairly good, switching back and forth between normal girl and porn star fairly well. Most of the supporting cast is fine; Olyphant is particularly sharp, and I enjoyed Marquette, but that's probably because he reminded me of a smart ass I knew in high school (he even looked like him). In fact, overall, the film is reasonably entertaining.There's just one catch; you've seen this movie before, and it was called Risky Business. Virtually everything is the same; the hooker is now a porn star, and we're freeing a Vietnamese genius student rather than repairing daddy's Porsche, but in essence the movie is exactly the same, from the young guy falling for a much more experienced partner to the menacing manager (Olyphant was good, but he's no Joe Pants) even to the very way they choose to absolve the main character's debt. The movie follows Risky Business page for page, even closely substituting the obscene catch phrase with one very similar to it. In some respects this film exceeds its source material  Elisha Cuthbert is far better than Rebecca De Mornay, whom I never really thought was any good in the first place  but Hirsch is no Tom Cruise, and in the end, you're just basically getting the same story with some of the rougher edges sanded down told to a new generation. Worth looking at if you don't mind that, but be aware that's exactly what you're getting.",5,1,2,13 October 2004
Spider-Man 2," Nothing you haven't seen before
","In all fairness, Spider-man 2 is not that bad. Mostly it's just dumb and overplayed, just like its much ballyhooed predecessor, which people also liked more than it deserved. I don't have anything against Sam Raimi (except Darkman) or Spider-man the character, but folks, these films just aren't that good. Spider-man 2 has moments where it takes off and is exhilarating, but only moments; most of the movie is like your overweight uncle who talks too much at the holidays. You don't really mind him but you wish he'd shut up and leave.After roping in the heart of every fanboy by starting off the movie with copious artwork by their anointed Michaelangelo, Alex Ross (who is admittedly talented but does the same thing over and over), or someone paid to imitate his work, they recap the first tepid adventure of Spidey and then proceed to make mostly the same mistakes they did the first time. We get all the histrionics of a relationship between Peter (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), but none of the build-up; these two have spent four minutes together on screen and they talk like they were lovers for years. Then we're saddled with Harry Osborn (James Franco), who really should have completed, or started, his acting lessons. The first half hour of the film is one painful scene after another in a pointless attempt to establish Peter Parker as Charlie Brown. Ziggy isn't as much of a loser as this guy. It gets old, really fast, and I was checking my watch after the thirty-five minute mark.Thankfully Alfred Molina comes in as Doc Ock to give a little oomph to the proceedings. Long one of the lamest characters in comics, Ock here is a pretty decent guy who just wants to make things better. Molina's pretty good until of course he has to go on the necessary rampage, which is inspired by the death of a loved one and some splashy special effects, and then finally we get a chance for the film to get good. Spidey and Doc Ock's first fight is really terrific  it zings, it soars, it wakes you up from the wincing half-slumber you'd fallen into. Sadly, Spider-man then takes off his costume again, so we get a bunch of Dawson's Creek reject scenes with him and Mary Jane, who has obviously fallen in love with him even though she's only exchanged seventeen words of dialogue with him (and she has a hunky new beau played by Daniel Gillies). When Spidey and Ock go at it again, the movie once more comes to life, and follows that pattern; Spidey okay, Peter dull.Trouble is, they have a pretty strong ending that is only slightly overdone (subtle by this movie's standards) and gives the audience exactly what they want. So those few who are going to spot the film's many and obvious flaws are going to forget them in the admittedly wonderful ending. Aside from a juvenile throw-away scene promising the next villain will be as retarded and uninspired as the first, the last twenty minutes of the film are by far the strongest of the piece. If only that inspiration could have spread to more of the film.Okay, here's the real problem with Spider-man 2. Though the New York Times, and others, bill it as 'the greatest superhero movie ever,' it is in fact not only not the greatest superhero film ever (which would still be 1978's Superman), it's one you've already seen before. In no significant way is this film any different from 1981's Superman II. All of the plot elements are the same, you have two villains, it all revolves around the hero's secret identity, etc. I could go on (and on) with this argument but will cut it short to avoid spoiling Spider-man 2 for you in case you haven't seen it.And I'll go you one better. Not only is this film Superman II, it's also Smallville, the Movie (it should be, it was written by the same guys). Osborn is nothing more than Lex Luthor, the head of a wealthy corporation bankrolling villains. Peter and Mary Jane mouth the same sentiments as Clark and Lana, down to some of the very same lines that those two characters have said. If this is the 'greatest super hero movie ever,' you could have seen it for free by watching Smallville every week.I was harsher to this movie than it deserves; it really isn't that bad, and it doesn't make me angry, like that turd Stepford Wives did. But I'm annoyed that I'm going to have to hear everyone else crow about a mediocre film that's a rehashed remake/rewrite like it's the best thing since the Bard. If this is all that moviegoers in this country really want, then they get exactly the cinema they deserve. There's really no harm in going to see this film; the only harm is in thinking it's especially good or original.",2,7,16,3 July 2004
Constantine," A little too murky for its own good
","I'm not a particularly big fan of the Hellblazer comic books; they're of that new breed of comics where everyone has to swear, smoke, drink a lot, and either be English or have English friends (thanks a lot, Moore, Ennis, and all the rest of you Brits for 'modernizing' the comics industry). That being said, I was interested in Constantine because, well, I like the stars (Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz), I like the general concept (Heaven vs. Hell), and, well, lamely, it looked neat.Constantine is mostly concerned with its titular character (Reeves) who apparently died and came back able to see demons and fight them (this is never really made clear, you sort of have to pay attention to pick all that up). He's a pack-and-a-half a day smoker who's grim, taciturn, and takes his job very seriously. He quickly runs into Angela Dodson (Weisz), who is a cop investigating her twin sister's suicide/ possible murder (in another murky bout of storytelling, they don't tell you Weisz is playing twins, so the first fifteen minutes are pure hell to figure out). She thinks there's something altogether mysterious and ooky about it, so she goes to Constantine for help.Constantine is awash in darkness, from the way the film is shot to its overall tone and subject matter. There's precious little humor in the thing - it takes itself viciously seriously - and mostly the film is a downer. The forces of darkness are suitably twisted and malevolent (Constantine's main enemy on Earth is a demon named Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale) who pretty much looks like a lawyer), but the forces of light are no beacon either - besides Constantine himself, there's Chas Chandler (Shia LeBouf, playing exactly the same role as he did in I,Robot) and a host of weirdo sidekicks who know everything about bugs, who live in the back of bowling alleys, etc. Nothing here is normal, or bright - or explained.One of Constantine's major problems is that very murkiness it embraces - both in the tone of the piece and in the writing. Absolutely nothing is explained - why exactly is a pool of water a conduit to Hell? - and the viewer is left to grapple with one weirdness after another. Apparently Constantine finds it all normal, so I guess we're supposed to as well. But from the get-go, the lack of clarity in both the visuals and the writing makes the film damn hard to get involved in.Reeves is fine here as the beleaguered hero. His minimalist approach to acting suits the character just fine, and he gives you just enough to have grudging sympathy for John. Weisz, frankly, most of the time looks lost. I know she's a better actress than this material, but she mostly seems to be wandering around in a daze through the whole film (maybe she had already seen it; she could pass for one of the audience). Two of the other important roles - the archangel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) and Lucifer himself (Peter Stormare) and so badly cast they help wreck whatever scant momentum the film is able to summon up. Swinton seems to have been chosen solely on the basis of resemblance to Cate Blanchett, and Stormare just doesn't have the gravitas to play the King of Hell. When it all comes down at the end, it really feels like Reeves matching up against two 'B' actors - and it's not like anyone is mistaking Keanu for Pacino in the first place.Constantine has some sharp ideas in it - little thoughtful things here and there sprinkled throughout - but much like the work that inspired it, the film is so busy trying to be cool that it forgot along the way to be good and entertaining as well. I know with the uber-success of Spiderman that a lot of comic book films have been green lighted, and the Blade movies even proved you can go a little dark with them. But not this dark, and certainly not this murky. Purportedly a story about a man trying to escape Hell and win his way back into Heaven, Constantine is more like Purgatory, a drab grey unending plain of nothing, where a sort of grainy twilight prevails. Definitely wait for the DVD, or just skip this one altogether.",4,1,14,23 February 2005
Troy," A masterful telling of an epic story
","Troy (2004)I had been keenly anticipating this movie since I saw the trailer last fall and watched the fleet of a thousand ships sailing over the Aegean. In all fairness, The Iliad is my favorite book (well, that and Paradise Lost, depending upon when you ask me), so I would have been interested in any decent-looking attempt to film it. Seeing that Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot) would be helming it and liking what I saw of the cast, I went into Troy with high hopes.Troy is an epic and makes no bones about it. While there is effort and detail put into the characters, the scope's the thing, and retelling the greatest war story ever told demands no less. There really are a thousand ships in Agamemnon's fleet; the Greek army stretches to the horizon; Troy herself is a splendid ancient metropolis; and there is much talk of immortality, of the motivations of mankind, nobility, and honor. Troy takes itself seriously, but that's not always a bad thing, and necessary when you're trying to make a real movie as opposed to a mindless action piece.The only thing I'll say about the plot (one of the most well-known in the world) is that Petersen and screenplay writer David Benioff stick fairly close to the spirit of the book, even if they vary in some of the details (all appearances of the gods - and there are many in Homer's work - have been excised, as have any references to homosexuality). Some character details have been changed and some characters who survived the war in the book die here and vice versa, but much like John Boorman's Excalibur, this film succeeds marvelously at capturing the essence of its source material.Most of the casting is excellent. Peter O'Toole's Priam is very effective; his nobility and regal bearing win us over at once. Likewise, Eric Bana's Hector is more appealing than in the book; Hector is the real hero of the Trojan side here, but he has been humanized, and he comes off as almost regretting that he such a skilled warrior. Orlando Bloom does a capable job as Paris; personally I have always intensely detested Paris as a character, because he's such a pathetic weakling, but Bloom does his best in trying to imbue Paris with some sort of backbone (he's still weak next to Hector, though). And Diane Kruger's Helen, while she has only limited screen time, is suitably regretful and beautiful; she resembles a prettier, younger Sharon Stone, so you can understand why Menelaus is so ticked off when she leaves.Benioff took more liberties with the Greeks; Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson, probably best known for being William Wallace's best pal in Braveheart), comes off as kind of a clod, and Agamemnon has been transformed from the proud king of kings into a megalomaniacal George W. Bush, a leader hell-bent on war at any cost who wants to transform the world in his image. Odysseus, another Homeric character I've always loathed, is actually excellent here; Sean Bean plays him as an intelligent, clever warrior rather than as the trickster/rascal he is in the book. And of course, the lion's share of the Greek story is given over to Achilles (Brad Pitt). I was very pleasantly surprised that Achilles' selfish ego was carried over into the movie, and his angry edge is retained. Though he is given a little bit of nobility toward the end, Achilles is not all that far from his literary counterpart, save that he is a little deeper of a thinker.But how Pitt brings him to life elevates this film. Everyone turns in strong performances, and with exceptional costuming and settings, the story really comes to life. But watching Pitt's Achilles here is like watching Michael Jordan play basketball in his prime; no matter how good the other actor is, Pitt is just better. Pitt shines in the quieter moments as well as in the action sequences. The fighting style they give him is so unique and so flowing that watching him butcher the Trojans is like watching a well-choreographed dance number; in an extraordinary sequence somewhat inspired by the Normandy landing in Private Ryan, Achilles and his Myrmidons storm the Trojan beach and capture the temple of Apollo. It's violent, but also masterfully shot and realized. Likewise the duel between Achilles and Hector is brilliant, well played, showcasing not only some sharp fighting but managing to reflect the emotions of the combatants. And that goes for the rest of the film - the various ways in which the characters do battle are representative of their motivations and attitudes. Agamemnon pushes his troops to take everything at once; Hector balances offense and defense; Odysseus plots his strategy carefully; and Achilles' attacks are quick, clean, and deadly.It's hard to label a movie a masterpiece a day after it's been released, having only seen it once, but I wouldn't call that a stretch here. Never has this epic story been brought to life so vividly, with such strong characterization. The events spring from character, like any great plot (and even more so here than in Homer), and the eventual fate of almost every character is completely fitting with that individual's outlook on the world. Objectively, I had no qualms with the film at all; it's almost a perfectly realized version of The Iliad. Subjectively I differed with a few of the twists on the novel, but then I'm vehemently anti-Trojan, and I always have been. Most people familiar with The Iliad won't have any problems with the alterations, unless they are uber-purists. Unlike another recent film based upon an epic work, the changes here do not affect the spirit of the story at all.Troy is a terrific film, one that demands to be experienced on a large screen. It is magnificent from beginning to end, and even though it clocks in at a little over two and a half hours, it just flies by. This movie could have been four hours and I wouldn't have minded. The only downside I can see to Troy is that now the bar has been raised very high for every film coming out the rest of the year. Certainly the other blockbusters this summer now have a lot to live up to. But I would certainly urge anyone with even the slightest interest to catch this one on the big screen, so it can really be appreciated.",10,2,3,15 May 2004
Ed Wood," The one he'll be remembered for
","It's sort of embarrassing to admit it took me ten years to see this film. I'm not really a big fan of Tim Burton, and while I never had anything against him, I've only recently started to enjoy Johnny Depp's work. Given the subject matter, this just wasn't a movie I was interested in for a long time. But sometimes good things really are worth the wait.Ed Wood, of course, chronicles the Hollywood career of its eponymous subject, truly one screwed up individual; a cross-dresser with a fetish for angora, Wood churned out one horrifically bad film after another, culminating with Plan Nine From Outer Space, before descending into crappy porn films toward the end of his life. It isn't necessarily a happy story, and Burton wisely only tells a small sliver of it, from Ed's first movie, Glen or Glenda, through the premiere of Plan Nine.But the love that Burton has for Wood and his movies shines through in every frame. Though I find Burton needlessly artsy as a director, here that tendency serves him frightfully well, as he manages to do the near-impossible; make a film about someone that plays like one of their films (the abysmal Dragon is a shining example of how NOT to do this). Shot entirely in black and white, we see all of Wood's weirdos not as they were, but rather as Ed probably saw them, through the bizarre filter he must have viewed life with.Depp is simply brilliant here, probably even better than he was in Pirates of the Caribbean. He captures Wood's enthusiasm and slanted viewpoint, but he does so in a loving, positive way. Wood accepts, as we must, that he was a screwed-up hack, but it never drags him down; in fact, Depp has him reveling in it, and it is that very passion that buoys up the movie. It doesn't hurt that nearly everyone else is very strong too, from Jeffrey Jones' crank 'psychic' Criswell to Bill Murray's Bunny Breckenridge, who often talks about having a sex change but never goes through with it. George 'The Animal' Steele captures Tor Johnson perfectly, and even Lisa Marie is excellent as Vampira. But the true great performance of the film, outshining even Depp, is Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. He won the Oscar for this, and deservedly so; he presents Lugosi at the end of his life, a washed-up has been, a shell of a man who was once a great star but is now no more than an addict. Landau virtually disappears in the role, and all you get is Lugosi, every tragic inch of him. Again, we see him not only as he was, but how Wood and even Burton see him, and the effect is masterful. One speech in particular, where Lugosi repeats a speech that Wood wrote for him about once being the master of the world but now on the verge of coming back is particularly haunting, and Landau is simply riveting.Ed Wood is a rare beast  it's a Tim Burton film that doesn't go overboard, it's a movie about Hollywood (sort of) that isn't self-indulgent, it's a nostalgia trip that manages not to be sappy but is still very warm and caring, and overall it's just a strikingly well-done film. I was impressed on many levels, most particularly with Depp and Landau, but really with the whole movie, that such a truly screwed-up human being could be shown in such a positive, indeed, loving way. Ed Wood is nothing less than a tribute to its subject, and in that, as in many other ways, it succeeds marvelously. If somehow you've missed this film, as I had until recently, you owe it to yourself to see it. It's simply a wonderful piece of film-making that should not be missed.",9,236,286,6 December 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Disaster film not disastrous
","Disaster movies are in general a part of cinema best avoided; despite Irwin Allen's commercially successful spate in the 70s (and Poseidon Adventure wasn't that bad, but), I still feel they are a genre more or less best eschewed if possible. But the teaser trailer released at the top of the year for Day After Tomorrow was very enticing; brief shots of hurricanes, destruction, and then, echoing one of the most memorable shots in cinematic history, a frozen Statue of Liberty as we pan up from a team of arctic travelers to see New York as a giant frozen tomb. I was intrigued by this film until I saw that it would be masterminded by Roland Emmerich, who in my mind is responsible for more bad modern cinema than any other one person (even Jerry Bruckheimer). Emmerich is the 'genius' who brought us the tepid Stargate and the blasphemous American version of Godzilla, and taught us with Independence Day that a crappy film craftily advertised will do big box office. So he has a history of misleading us with glossy trailers that promise a quality that his movies never contain, and has proven to be a master at enticing the public to see films best avoided even on video.Thus I went in skeptically yesterday, prepared to be let down as the movie failed to live up to even a sliver of the promise of the trailer. And, yes, Day After Tomorrow is not without its flaws. But I was rather surprised to find that while it is a disaster film, it is not a disastrous film, as some have claimed (to me, critics are especially ignorant this summer), but rather a fairly well done film with effects and concepts that will, yes, knock your eyes out.The plot mechanics owe a lot to lesser films like Armageddon and the like: we've screwed up the earth and we don't realize it, and Mama Nature bites us in the butt faster than we can prepare for. That an ice age can be triggered overnight is a bit much to take, but they at least try to explain why it can happen and I'm nowhere near enough of a meteorologist to know if what they said was bunk or not. All I know is that the science sounded good, and that's all it needs to in a decent story. And anything that gets gas-guzzling Americans to even consider global warming is doing a huge public service.Emmerich (wrote and directed) chooses the necessary human element in such a story to revolve around the Halls; father Jack (Dennis Quaid) is a climatologist who in the Emmerichian tradition is the first to realize we're headed to hell in a hand basket (see Jeff Goldblum in ID4 for a far less effective version of this character). Mother Lucy (Sela Ward) is a doctor, and is given only minor screen time. Most of the human angle revolves around son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal, the guy you get when you can't get Tobey Maguire), who is trapped with several brainy school chums in NYC at a nerdy academic contest. Also along for the ride is the ever-terrific Ian Holm, who plays English weather guru Terry Rapson.Though the entire world is affected by the events in the story, Emmerich wisely has most of the story take place in New York, a place most of us are familiar enough with so the massive destruction means a little more (come on, if he had destroyed Reno, who would have cared?). We are treated to sumptuous visuals of New York flooding and then freezing in some of the most effective computer wizardry ever, and though we know what we are seeing isn't real, never once can you actually tell. The visuals are simply perfect, not only well-rendered but well-realized, and though we will probably never live to see the next ice age, I had no trouble accepting that it may look like this (though it will likely develop a lot more slowly). Sure, the plot dips into some clichés  Lucy stays behind at the hospital to tend to a tug-at- your-heart bald cancer child, Sam has to try and win the affection of his pretty teammate Laura (Emmy Rossum) from the hunky local rich kid who helps them out, and once again the scientists know more than them evil guv'mint types, but for all that pablum, the human element in the story comes off pretty well. Quaid can play earnest with the best of them, and his performance goes a long way in helping to sell the film (at one point I wondered what the film would have been like with ID4's Bill Pullman in the Quaid role and shuddered). Ward, though her part is small, is also very good, and Ian Holm plays Rapson with his standard understated grace; when the good doctor at one point raises his scotch and utters, 'To mankind,' it's not maudlin, it's heartfelt. A large part of the film rests on Gyllenhaal's shoulders, and he, like Holm, underplays his role, which is a relief in this type of film.Day After Tomorrow isn't exactly brain candy, but it is an interesting and well-executed disaster movie. The few times it goes overboard  like a silly race against a chilling wind  are easily forgiven because they are surrounded by all of the things done well. It won't win any awards for the movie of the year, but it was a damn sight better than I expected, and, preaching at the end aside, I left the film extremely pleasantly surprised. The Day After Tomorrow entertains completely, pulling us in at the start and never letting go of its hold on our imagination, and really, isn't that what we go to the movies for?",7,0,0,30 May 2004
X-Men," Could have been worse, could have been better
","Not a bad attempt and given Marvel's history of *terrible* films, this one is a pretty good effort. Pretty to look at and containing a good dose of humor, X-Men combines elements from all through the run of the comic, mostly for the better. The plot isn't all that terribly well thought-out or explained, however, and the exposition zips by like a bullet train. Storm and Cyclops are little more than moving standees, unfortunately. But Jackman is excellent, and Paquin does agreat job with Rogue. A good film, could have been a great one.",6,0,0,22 July 2000
Ocean's Twelve," Second verse pretty much same as the first
","I thought Ocean's Eleven (the 2001 version) was a nice piece of star-studded fluff, basically lighthearted fun. I didn't really get into the movie until I had been to Vegas, however, and now I enjoy it quite a bit. I've also become fonder of some of the actors involved in the film (most notably Mssrs Pitt and Damon), so I looked forward to this heist film a little more than I did the first.Ocean's Twelve is pretty much second verse, same as the first  which is fine, if that's what you're in the market for. The same easy camaraderie, the same joking between pals, the same clever set ups and the same bit with fooling the audience toward the middle of the film. It all follows the first film with some minor variations, which is exactly what most people want and indeed expect in a sequel.Clooney is back as the charismatic leader of the group of thieves (who balk in a very funny scene at being referred to as 'Ocean's Eleven') who find themselves with not one nemesis in this film, but three; not only is Andy Garcia back as Terry Benedict (in a far smaller role), but Danny and the gang must contend with a 'Europol' officer out to get them, one Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones) as well as competing with a fellow thief, the Nightfox (Vincent Cassel, playing, as he usually does, another smarmy prick). The entire crew returns  Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, Elliot Gould, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Scott Caan, etc., and there's even a sort of extended cameo for Julia Roberts.The good times roll with the gang as we get to see how each of them is spending his part of the fortune pilfered in the first movie as, one by one, Benedict tracks them down. The reunion happens fairly quickly and most of the best scenes in the film involves the group all gathered together, where everyone is bitching at one another playfully, jibing one another, and throwing out ideas. These scenes have a wonderful ad-libbed quality to them, and they carry the first hour or so of the picture, from the moment everyone realizes they're in trouble to the time they pull off their first heist together. The first hour is a pure fun treat.It's in the second hour that Ocean's Twelve wanders a bit astray. Not content with another heist, the plot puts them in competition with uber-Europrick Nightfox, who is rich, well connected, an amazing thief, etc. This whole part felt a tad contrived, and while the planning of the second heist is fun, the actual execution of it is painful. Julia Roberts comes in for a subplot so stupid and silly it seems lifted from a Wayans Brothers spoof of the genre, complete with ham-handed acting and a wholly unnecessary cameo by Bruce Willis (Pitt, Clooney, Roberts, Damon, Zeta-Jones  you don't have enough star power already?). The movie temporarily descends into pratfall comedy, away from the clever verbal jabs and situational shorthand it employed so effectively until then. It sort of recovers, but not entirely, and the movie feels a little shabby afterward (not a help that Roberts and Clooney come off as smarmy in the final confrontation with Cassel).The acting is by and large fine. Clooney takes a smaller role but he's still good. Pitt's character is deepened a little even though he too seems to have less screen time than the first one. Elliot Gould is exceedingly sharp; a lot of his one-liners are incredibly funny. Carl Reiner isn't around enough, but when he is, he's hysterical. Damon has to shoulder a lot of the load and he does so very well, playing the nervous rookie perfectly. Roberts is okay, but I so thoroughly disliked what they did with her toward the end that it's hard for me to judge. A big surprise was how sharp Catherine Zeta-Jones was, and yet how well she fit in with this established group. Isabel was a welcome addition to the movie and is give a surprising amount of backstory and depth. She really stands out, which, even though she's the only woman in the bulk of the film, is still a real feat with this cast.By and large the film is light fun, easy on the brain and the eyes, and a good fun time. Nothing especially deep, but that's never the intent. Aside from the one extended SNL-bad gig with Roberts, I would highly recommend it; that bad part was enough to make me say that it's still worth seeing, but you could maybe wait for the DVD. I don't care to be jarred out of a film so blatantly, especially one where a nice warm feeling of clever companionship had been so craftily composed in the first leg of the movie. But your mileage may vary. It's probably worth at least a matinée to see some of the biggest movie stars of the day having fun with one another.",7,1,4,11 December 2004
Crash," Powerfully done drama
","Crash deals with an automobile accident that touches the lives of several people in L.A. Cheadle leads the movie as Detective Graham, who is rear-ended at a crime scene, which kicks off the movie. The rest of the two hours shows us how we got there, following the threads of several different seemingly disconnected lives and showing how in fact they all influence one another without ever meaning to.Crash does not always come together; it's a little hard to get into because we aren't given anyone to latch onto, and at the start the movie stakes a claim that deep down where they live, everybody's pretty much a prick, more often than not (excepting a character named Daniel, played by Michael Pena). The people we meet are not always sympathetic  in fact Bullock pretty much plays a racist jack-ass  but they are always honest and real, even if they can be unpleasant. Ludicrous in particular is saddled with a character that could have been played as comedy, the young black male who sees an anti-black motivation to everything in the whole world; but in this film, the character comes off as realistic as any other.Where Crash excels is in betraying your expectations. One person is set up sympathetically, and he turns out to be a jerk; another is set up as a jerk, and he turns out to have a solid core. Not every character is a twist, and not every situation relies on irony, but there's enough there to make a central theme in the film. In lesser hands this could have played out poorly, but Crash is so deftly orchestrated that there are some moments of dramatic payoff in this film that most movies can never hope to achieve; and some of them, you don't even see coming, which is even more welcome.Bullock's obnoxious character is given a brief moment so strong toward the end that it brought tears to my eyes; likewise a speech given by Cameron, a black TV producer (played expertly by Terrence Howard) to Ludicrous' thug character at the end is very, very strong. Ryan Phillipe has a few excellent scenes, though his is a lesser role than some of the others. But the two most powerful scenes in the movie spring from directly opposing desires in the viewer  one an act you desperately don't want to see happen, and one you do.Matt Dillon plays a racist cop who is forced to come to the aid of a woman (Thandie Newton) he harassed; the initial scenes with their characters don't play out that strongly, but when they confront one another in literally a life-and-death situation, the emotion is so powerful it leaps off the screen at you; probably five minutes of some of the best film-making I have ever seen. Likewise, the one wholly positive character in the film, Daniel, captures our sympathy almost at once, and his scenes with his daughter are tender and unaffected, very natural. When suddenly she is put into danger, the viewer can't help but react strongly (several people in the theater gasped audibly); what happens there, again, is simply brilliant, brilliant film-making, drama at its finest, reaching off the screen and touching us where we live.Crash offers no easy answers, and everyone in the film must come to some difficult realization about themselves. It's not always an easy film to digest, and it plays with some ugly truths about people, America, and our society. But its very lack of a pat ending, its very unwillingness to wrap up the story in any sort of convenient way, make it a much stronger film. Though not a flawless piece of work, Crash is so strong in so many areas that even though we have more than six months left, it's hard to contemplate a better film being released this year. So often you hear ads proclaim 'one of the most powerful dramas of the year.' Well, those words would be true of this film. I don't know if Crash is playing everywhere, but you owe it to yourself to see this in the theaters if you can  though the drama is so intense that it will still play well on DVD, I would imagine.",10,1,10,14 May 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Crap, crap, and more crap
","I've been a Star Wars fan since 1977 and have faithfully followed Lucas' franchise. I've really enjoyed every film (Jedi was shaky) and even very much liked Phantom Menace. But I'm appalled at how poorly made Attack of the Clones was, and surprised that Lucas would release such a poorly-thought out and made film. Some of the CGI is just plain bad. I won't harp on the dialogue or acting, but as a Star Wars fan, it's just a bad Star Wars film. The characters are largely stupid, the action scenes have no meaning and feel disconnected from the plot, and much of the character motivation is either stupid or missing altogether. Lucas fails utterly to make central character Anakin sympathetic, and the weak plot with gaping holes does nothing to make up for this. Most people are raving about the big fight at the end and the Yoda vs. Dooku match, but to me the whole arena sequence was just an extended excuse for juvenile antics. Yoda's fight is reminiscent more of Daffy Duck's antics than of anything that belongs in Star Wars. Truly a letdown on every level.",2,1,2,5 June 2002
Pitch Black," Not bad for a little cheapie matinée
","I got into this movie ass-backwards  basically, I went to see the sequel and then had someone lend it to me to watch on DVD. Pitch Black is the first movie in the 'Chronicles of Riddick' series, and while it has nowhere near the scope or vision of its follower, is nonetheless an enjoyable film, for what it is.Part bughunt movie and part low budget sci-fi matinée, Pitch Black follows the story of a group of people stranded on a hot desert planet with three suns and only intermittent periods of darkness. Adding to the threat level is that one of the characters, Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel) is a prisoner, apparently a killer of some sort who cannot be trusted. One of the younger characters, Jack (Rhiana Griffith), takes a shine to him and begins imitating his every move, much to the dismay of his would-be jailer, William Johns (Cole Hauser). The group stumbles on a deserted mining colony and soon discovers there are evil nasties that only come out  you got it  after dark. When they need to make a run to an equally deserted outpost to obtain supplies to fix their damaged ship, however, that's when things get interesting.Pitch Black isn't great film-making  it's a cheaper version of an Aliens flick, let's be honest  but the rough and gritty universe is fun, and the ambivalence of Riddick is fun to watch. As darkness sets in and his special ability to see in almost total blackness comes into play, people become more reliant on his uncaring character, which adds a nice twist to an otherwise average if serviceable script and story. Much of the meat of the story revolves around Riddick, which was a smart decision.Diesel will never be considered a great thespian but he's fine here as Riddick, his basso voice and rough edges fitting into the harsh landscape and story perfectly. Keith David plays an Imam with an appropriately reverent air, and the rest of the cast all does a fine job.Pitch Black's worth a rental, if for no other reason than to cast a little more back story on Riddick so you can enjoy the top-notch sequel a but better. It's a decent enough movie in its own right, though a little cheap and a little predictable. But as cheap sci-fi goes, it's pretty good.",6,0,1,16 January 2005
Kung Fu Panda 2," Sadly no better than the first one
","See, when you start to get older, you forget some things, like sometimes what you thought of a movie. Not a major crime, but it can lead to little mistakes, like renting this film. For some reason (Angelina Jolie's voice acting? Encroaching senility?) I recalled, incorrectly, liking the first KFP. I got my hands on this, queued it up, and then read my review of the first one (maybe I should have performed those tasks in a different order). When I recalled how kind of flat I thought the first one was, I thought, well, maybe this one will be better.It's not. It's not a terrible film, but it's flat and lazy like the first one. Here big fat Po (Jack Black, the titular panda), now a member of the legendary Dragon Warriors, has two dilemmas; he and the other Dragons must take back a remote city from the new bad guy, a crane (really? a zillion animals in Chinese folklore and the bad guy is a bird?) and also has to find out his true heritage, as it's really blanking obvious his father cannot biologically be a duck. The two plots progress slowly, and of course are tied together, and naturally we have to stop every dozen minutes or so to let the cartoon characters duke it out.The design work is fine, and executed very sharply – it's a pretty pseudo-Chinese pastoral world, and we have the requisite gorgeous scenery paired with the evil, red-lit infernal machine factory of the crane (in a plot that felt wholly stolen from Detective Dee). KFP character design tends more toward the cartoony – and for some reason flashbacks are done in traditional animation, to help separate them from the CGI stuff – and that doesn't change here (I liked the addition of the rhino, even though he does nothing but stand around). The problem here is, once again, a lazy script full of fat/eating jokes and some uninspired voice work. How is it that Jolie could make a fish seem sexy in Shark Tale, and yet fails to do anything but a straight reading with the most eroticized of animals, a big cat? Maybe that's direction, but it seems like she's sort of phoning it in, as does everyone, excepting of course James Hong, who once again is amusing as Po's duck daddy.I'm sure the kids enjoyed this film (it did depressingly well at the box office), but unlike, say, Despicable Me or almost any of the Pixar films, there is nothing here for anyone over the age of ten. I tend to prefer family films that work on at least two levels, so the poor parents aren't bored stiff for eighty-five minutes, but the only other consideration other than cranking out a requisite sequel for this film seems to be to sell more action figures. Much like the first one, you could give this uninspired flick a pass and not miss much. My only subtextual giggle was seeing all the flashbacks with the panda village, which reminded me of the next expansion for Warcraft. But I doubt many of you would make that connection.",3,2,6,2 January 2012
"I, Robot"," Not great, not bad
","The story is just what you see in the trailer; Detective Del Spooner (Smith) investigates an apparent homicide committed by a robot, a supposed impossibility. During the course of his investigation he runs into Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood, revising his science is God!' turn from Disturbing Behavior), who runs the company that builds the robots, and Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynihan), one of the primary gurus who helps design them. While no one else believes the robot did it, Spooner is convinced, and as things unravel we begin to see that maybe he's on to something.Eye-popping visuals abound; Chicago in 2035 is a pretty hip place, full of sleek cars we'll never use and realistic-looking robots everywhere. Most of the future tech is handled well and is not too out there, which helps the movie a lot. There are no flying cars here and no vertical highways (a la Minority Report), though they do pull the stunt of saying `vintage 2004.' Some of the movie's design is derivative; the robot delivery behemoths greatly resemble their Star Wars counterparts, and the older series robots look like they could have stepped right out of Lucas' art department (a great concept has one painted with the Fed Ex logo as the ultimate delivery man). But enough of it is cool looking that parallels are mostly easily forgiven.Smith has a trickier time with Spooner. Sometimes he seems almost uncomfortable in the role, as if trying not to wisecrack is a strain for him. At certain points in the film he's just fine, and he certainly excels in the action sequences; but other times he seems like he's foundering. Moynihan is acceptable but doesn't display any flair as Susan; she's too cold for too long to really be accessible as a character. Ironically the movie is stolen by Sonny (Alan Tudyk), the alleged robot murderer. More human (and expressive) than his flesh-and-blood compatriots, Sonny grows more compelling as the film proceeds. Maybe there eventually will be an Oscar for Best Performance by a Synthespian someday, especially if they continue to outdo their real co-stars.Sadly, the plot borrows a lot of clichés (and a HUGE one from the old Marvel comics Star Wars, no less!) from a lot of places. The few plot twists' are easily seen a mile away, and there's no great suspense or mystery as we build toward the video-game inspired climax. Where I will give I,Robot credit is that it tries and nearly succeeds to be something we haven't seen in a LONG time  a sci-fi movie that is more than just an action flick, a film that tries to make you think. I, Robot is not especially deep, but at least it attempts to have a brain, which is more than I can say for most movies I've seen this summer. I'd rather see a near miss at a thoughtful movie like this one than one that never even attempts it, like, say, Spiderman 2. I don't know that I,Robot will be everyone's cup of tea, and it certainly has its flaws; but for my money it tries very hard, and that's worth something, even if it doesn't always succeed.",5,0,0,18 July 2004
Collateral," Good film betrayed by weak ending
","Casting Tom Cruise against type isn't the only thing Collateral has going for it, but it's probably the best thing about the movie. Cruise, whom we have known over the last two decades for playing heroes of varied stripes, finally turns in his do-gooder's suit for something of a little darker stripe.Collateral itself is a seedier film than one usually sees Cruise in, steeped in the world of criminal shadiness, drug runners, hired assassins, and the like. It's a place where Cruise should seem ill-at-ease, but his Vincent not only works organically, he's compelling enough that we want to root for him  and he is not the good guy, not by a long shot. Jamie Foxx co-stars as a cabdriver named Max who very simply gets caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, and tries to make the best of his bad situation. While Foxx is also not the first person you would think of for a role of this sort, he inhabits Max's skin very comfortably as well; most of the film is he and Cruise playing off one another, and they do this very well.Director Mann gives us just enough of a story to get by, and that's all you really need. Details would be meaningless in a plot like this, and so exposition is left to the wayside and largely substituted with character development; this pays off through most of the film, and as Max and Vincent get to know one another better, the dramatic ante is upped. A scene where they visit Max's mother in the hospital is particularly well-done, as is one where Max has to pretend he's Vincent in front of a crimelord. The film moves along at a brisk and engaging pace until the ending; there's a horrible plot contrivance, and it deflates the proceedings somewhat. The movie is strong up until that point, but the ending simply asks for too much suspension of disbelief, and ends up betraying the rest of the film.But both Cruise and Foxx turn in strong performances, and the movie's worth going to see if for no other reason than to watch these two fence with one another (they reportedly got along famously on set; I think some of that camaraderie seeps into the picture, despite the fact that the two are adversaries). But Collateral is fairly solid up until the end, and showcases two pretty strong performances. Given the high caliber of other thrillers this summer, Collateral might not be able to hold its own due mostly to its weak ending; but if you have a second run theater near you, it's definitely worth checking out there.",6,0,0,7 August 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Not as charming as the first two
","I like the Harry Potter books and so far I've liked the Potter films. The casting's been excellent, the realizing of the world has been deftly done, and the movies by and large have retained the flavor of the books while being enjoyable in their own right. When Chris Columbus announced he wouldn't be helming the third one (or exhaustion would have killed him), I was concerned because more or less I felt he was the primary factor in why these films so readily translated the magic of the novels. And while he's still involved with the new film, you can definitely tell someone else is doing the driving.There would have been more changes between this one and the last one at any rate; the cast no longer looks twelve, they look like they belong on The O.C. Richard Harris died, so you have a new Dumbledore, who is such a key player in the saga. And the third story is where things stop completely revolving around Harry and Hogwarts and we start to see the larger wizardly world. So Azkaban was going to feel different from its predecessors no matter what.But unlike the rest of the world, apparently, I'm not utterly thrilled with how different this movie is. Hogwarts has been completely rearranged; the kids only barely wear their uniforms, and only barely go to school; and characters who had been well handled up until now become doddering dunces.Which is not to say Azkaban is a bad film, because it's not; there is some excellent material in there. It's more to say Azkaban is a joyless film, one with little warmth or heart or humor. That's fine if you set out to make a movie like, say, Underworld, but it seems oddly out of place in the world of Hogwarts.The three leads are all fine, even if they look sixteen or seventeen now (save Watson, she looks a tad younger). No adult character should ever refer to their age in the script again, though; these kids can no more sell thirteen than Luke Perry could sell himself as a high schooler in 90210. I actually prefer the new Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) who seems more like the sly old wizard in the books. Most of the supporting professors are given short shrift: Emma Thompson is fun but wasted in what amounts to little more than a cameo as Madame Trelawney, Maggie Smith gets her one scene to cluck at Harry and his pals, and even Alan Rickman's Snape seems to lack his usual menace. Newcomer Remus Lupin (David Thewlis) is perfunctory, never bad but never great. He lacks any sort of strong screen presence and does little more than fill his role ably. Compare any of these characters to the knockout showing by Ken Branagh last time as Lockhart and you come away woefully lacking.Director Alfonso Cuaron seems not to understand what makes these movies special; the whole point of Harry Potter is that it takes place in a world like ours but wonderfully removed from it. I was initially pleased that our time with the Dursleys was glossed over briefly (you can never leave Privet Drive too quickly, even in the books), but when the Weasley family was similarly relegated to the 'three minutes and out' rule after dad gets his obligatory expository scene, I began to worry. We return to a Hogwarts that looks and feels different from the one in the first two films, none of the kids wear their uniforms for more than a moment or two, and even the balance between the main trio is upset. Ron is reduced to a punchline, a moron who babbles 'brilliant' every other scene but is given little else to do. Draco Malfoy, so wonderful last time around, is there only to sneer and be spit upon. Harry is given proper treatment, and Hermione is so boosted up that her name should be in the title too. But nearly everyone else is poorly handled (other than Dumbledore), and most of the movie I felt like I was watching a clumsy amateur attempt at making a Harry Potter film than an actual part of the franchise.There are moments of magic in this movie, though. When Harry soars on the hippogriff, Cuaron allows us to feel some of the magic that should have infused the whole film. Harry's realization at the end about his own abilities is a nice moment as well, and the very few scenes with Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) are all extremely well done. The first scene  and only the first scene  with the dementor is extremely effective. And so on; little bits of sunshine in an otherwise murky effort.I won't belabor you with the details of everything I thought done poorly (though the quidditch match was a disappointment of Lucasian propriotions), because I didn't think this was an awful film (my words above notwithstanding), I just felt it lacked that certain special warmth and attraction that every Potter book and movie before it had in abundance. Honestly, I feel like this film is a shining example of 'it wasn't broken and you didn't need to fix it.' That doesn't make it a bad film, but it certainly pales in comparison to the first two. I would suggest a little more care but put into casting and staffing next time if Warner's wants to make sure the franchise lasts out the full seven books. Another downer like this one (and the fourth book will be a troublesome adaptation in any case) and people might not want to come back.",5,3,6,5 June 2004
54," Tepid approach to interesting subject matter
","If you hit your teens in the 70s, as I did, you probably remember the stories about Studio 54 whether or not you liked disco. An exclusive club, it was the perfect symbol of 70s cultural overindulgence and self-absorption; there's even an excellent VH1 documentary about the club that could tell you everything you wanted to know about its heyday, and the stories are easily interesting enough to spawn a very captivating film.Sadly, this isn't it. 54 follows the lives of a few of its employees, a bartender named Shane (Ryan Phillippe), a busboy named Greg (Breckin Meyer), his wife, a coat-check girl, Anita (Selma Hayek), and of course the master of ceremonies himself, Steve Rubell (Mike Meyers). While the goings-on at the club are well represented, this film concerns itself more with the personal lives of the workers, following Shane's story the closest.The movie works in spurts. Sometimes it captures perfectly the shallowness of the nightlife culture (such as when Shane is taken to a dinner party and doesn't know who 'Errol Flynt' is), and other times it waxes into hokey melodrama. Some of that is inherent in the premise  following the underlings as they mingle in the world of the rich and fabulous  but a lot of it is due to the kid-gloved treatment with which both the club and Rubell are given throughout the movie. While Rubell certainly electrified the scene in New York with his penchant for over-the-top spectacle and his exclusive hand-picking of the crowds each night, the rampant drugs and sexuality are only briefly touched on; and Rubell himself, while his excesses are mentioned, come off oddly positive for a guy who was in life a liar, a cheat, a drug abuser, and promiscuous as all hell. Not that I was looking for the man to be pilloried here, but his ego directly contributed to the fall of his club and the diminishing of the nightlife culture he helped to elevate. A final scene where he gazes down at the regulars paternally is so emotionally false as to be patently absurd.Meyers does his best to capture Rubell, but he's given so little to work with here it's surprising his performance is effective; but he's good, and he helps to anchor the film. Philippe, whom I find generally to be a good actor, is hamstrung here by the shallowness and stupidity of his character; he's limited to a deer-in-the-headlights smile or a sullen uncomprehending frown, and even he can't translate that into a strong performance. Hayek and Meyer are both okay, again, undercut by the writing, and Neve Campbell  prominently featured on the DVD cover  appears so briefly she really has an extended cameo.For some reason I still find myself interested, even fascinated, by the popular culture of the second half of the seventies. But even given that, this is not a film that particularly engaged me, despite a predisposition to like it. I'd say if that era, or that club, has any interest for you, track down the VH1 special rather than this middle-of-the-road melodrama.",4,14,19,9 October 2006
Aliens," Good, but not as great as everyone says
","Certain genre films manage to strike a resonating chord with their audiences, and achieve not only popular success but a lingering cult that glorifies the movie into neo-scriptural status. 'Blade Runner' is such a film, perhaps the shining example of a genre film that too many people think is better than it really is; but 'Aliens' is another excellent example of a film that people elevate out of proportion to how good it really is.To be fair, 'Aliens' is a strong film. It has interesting characters, an engaging set-up, and some of the better production design ever seen in a sci-fi film. It's also disturbingly pro-military, which is understandable given its Reagan-era roots, but comes off more than a little hawkish now. And it does achieve what it set out to do, and what most sequels never can; to be as good as or better than the original. Granted, Ridley Scott's 'Alien' was a different type of film, a suspense/horror movie, where this is an action film (and yes, I am aware of parallels to 'Mummy/Mummy Returns').Watching 'Aliens' now is a different experience than seeing it back then; you have the following two movies in your memory (whether you want them there or not), and it's funny to see Paul Reisler (Carter Burke) doing anything other than watered-down comedy (he's very good here, by the way). The only other really recognizable actor is Sigourney Weaver, whom they unsuccessfully tried to build a franchise around; genre dorks like me can pick out Michael Biehn, whose career essentially peaked with this film, and of course Bill Paxton is in the background crying and bitching.The film comes off as very eighties when viewed through modern eyes. Burke in particular seems to have gotten stuck in 1985 (though Ripley's civilian garb is also horribly dated). Most of the military production design still holds up, however; ironically it succeeds in that by not being too futuristic. The tanks, dropship, etc, all still look and feel pretty cool.So why is this film not the be-all end-all that so many proclaim it to be? It's a good film, sure; the build up is particularly tense and effective, and the rough camaraderie between the marines is still enjoyable (though more of them seem to come off as dicks than I remember). The slow approach to the settlers' camp and the way Cameron chooses to unveil the aliens  remember, at that time we didn't all have little plastic dolls of them  is also very inventive, and while this is an action film, Cameron injects a healthy dose of horror into it.My basic issues with the film (which my recent re-watching did nothing to dispel) really came down to two things: Newt, and Cameron's 'mother' issues. The entire last third of the film, from a plot standpoint, is wholly unnecessary, because of these two items. The characters battle and beat (or at least hold off) the aliens and are well on their way out when, inexplicably, the clever and nimble-fingered Newt falls down an air vent, and we get a long, pointless detour that not only sours this film but mostly poisons the next two and the very concept of the aliens altogether.Kids are hard to do in genre films. Spielberg did a decent job with Short Round in 'Temple of Doom' and Alex O'Connell in 'Mummy Returns' manages to work well. But most of the other times, including here, kids are just annoying precocious plot devices. Newt doesn't bring anything to this film other than a lot of screaming; she tells us nothing about the aliens we don't learn from other sources, she sheds no light on the colonists, and she isn't even particularly effective comic relief. The only purpose she serves is to introduce the main sub-theme in the movie, Cameron's mother complex. By awakening Ripley's maternal instincts, Newt's presence sets us up for the ridiculous end-duel between Ripley, in a wearable forklift, and the woefully overdone Queen alien, an unnecessary invention that looks silly and cheapens the horror value of the aliens forever.Viewed with hindsight now, one can see that 'Aliens' could also be called 'T2 version 0.95'. Many similar elements, and even similar shots, are used in both films (compare Vasquez's intro with Sarah Connor's; the misapprehension of the lead character, a non-combatant, upon their first encounter with an android; the role both Newt and John play in re-humanizing their mothers; and so on). There's nothing really wrong with this  and Cameron would hardly be the first director to mine himself for ideas, and, frankly, you could do worse than steal from 'Aliens' for inspiration. But it's interesting to watch Cameron test several ideas out in this movie before fleshing them out in what is arguably his greatest work (come on, you didn't think I was referring to 'Titanic', did you?).'Aliens' remains an enjoyable and well-done film, if a bit dated, and I know I spent too much time here debunking myth and not enough praising the effective parts of the film, which are numerous. The longer-cut DVD adds nothing that you really missed in the first place (I could have lived without seeing Newt's parents) and imbues the early part of the film with pacing more appropriate for a novel (which probably explains why it was pared down). For sheer genre fun, the first two-thirds of this movie are hard to top, and it's not difficult to see why it has engendered such feverish devotion from genre fans. It's certainly worth a viewing if you haven't seen it recently. By and large the Alien franchise was pretty good ('Alien 3' being the extremely notable exception), and it never gets better than it does here. For most of the picture, anyway.",7,1,2,14 July 2004
Alien vs. Predator," A pretty good blending of two similar franchises
","It was an old idea, marrying two franchises that aren't producing and trying to stir up some life in them. Granted, it had been done before; Predators have been fighting Aliens for more than ten years in the comics. But this pairing made a lot of sense; both franchises started as semi-horror films (Predator, despite a grotesque amount of machismo, is essentially a horror film at its core) and graduated on to a sequel that was far more action than horror. So both franchises were a blend of the two elements, and since both dealt with creepy xenomorphs that treat us as prey, it only made sense to shove them together.AVP spends a fair amount of its abbreviated run time  87 minutes, including the credits  trying to prove its geek cred. There are numerous references dropped to Aliens, in particular (still a fan fetish fave) and they go through a fair amount of effort to show respect and knowledge of the movies that made this one possible. And then, wisely, they shuck all that out the window and just give us, essentially, a good old-fashioned shoot 'em up.Stuck in more for continuity's sake than anything else is Lance Henriksen, playing Charles Bishop Weyland (are you really trying to insinuate they would build an android three hundred years later that looked like the founder of the company? Come on), who serves as the plot motivator for this whole little shindig. The film follows a fairly standard formula; establish suitable creepiness in an unusual place, give us just enough character to make us care about at least a few of the people, and then drop them in a pit full of creepy crawlies and see who makes it out.What differentiates this film from the zillion others like it (The Thing, Ghosts of Mars, etc.) is that we sci-fi geeks have an avid interest in the two warring sides because we've sat through the twelve or so hours of prequels (more if you've seen them all on DVD) that set up this film. In a way, for sci-fi geeks, this is like that old comic book where the Hulk finally fights Superman and you get to see who's stronger. And therein lies the whole thrill. The writers do give us a smidgen of people to care about; chief among them are Sebastian (Raoul Bova) and Alexa (smartly played by Sanaa Lathan), whom we follow through most of the film; there are other characters, some even played by people you would recognize (one of the lesser hoods from Snatch; and one of my favorite not-yet discovered actors, Colin Salmon), but you've seen enough of these movies to know who's going to make it to the final reel and who's not by the time you're fifteen minutes into the story.Where AVP succeeds is in the way it spools itself out. There's a lot of time devoted to building tension, but it pays off nicely, even if it ignores all previously established continuity (and I say, go ahead. It's not like you're adapting the works of, say, J.R.R. Tolkien and you need to be precise or anything); all of the time exploring the creepy alien pyramid is well done (it's in the trailer, I'm spoiling nothing), and when the A's finally do get it on with the P's, the action is delivered in short, sharp bursts, the way it should be; no lengthy CGI battles, no utterly unbelievable sixty-foot jumps, just a couple of ugly butts slamming each other around.They do follow some of the conventions of both movies, but not slavishly, and I found that a nice homage. One thing I have always liked about the Alien films is their strong female heroine (even if it is always Ripley, or a derivation), and I was pleased to see that continue here; Alexa is cool, confident, capable, but very human.The movie speeds along at a decent pace, and is overall enjoyable as a summer flick and a sci-fi action yarn until the hideously predictable ending. You sort of know where it's going the second you see the Queen alien (may God damn James Cameron for that retarded 'innovation' to the Alien race), and you can see the ending choreographed a mile away. Which is a shame, because other than that, AVP is a pretty good film that achieves both its goals; one, to be digestible summer action fare, and two, to blend two similar film franchises into one, yet be respectful and dedicated to the conventions of both of them. Anyone who has read  or written  crossover fanfic knows this is not always easy to do, and the AVP folk succeeded marvelously on that score.Is it worth going to see? Depends on how much you like horror/action bug hunts. Of this type of film, this is a pretty good one. There are better ways to spend your $7 at the cineplex as summer is winding down, but there are far worse ones as well.",7,0,1,14 August 2004
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Serviceable, but not great
","I remain a fan of the original Planet of the Apes movies, which, aside from the first one, were slightly cheesy, but remain one of the most inventive franchises yet. I loathed Tim Burton's abortion from several years ago, and had washed my hands of any further attempts to revive the franchise, thinking perhaps the films were, and perhaps ought to remain, firmly rooted in their sociological place in time. But I kept hearing murmurs that this was a good film (one friend called it 'the best movie he'd seen all summer') and, well, okay, when it came out I broke down and checked out a copy.They changed the story little; this is really a revamp of the third movie, Escape From the Planet of the Apes, explaining the genesis of how intelligent apes came to be among us (the original version features a delightfully impossible cause-and-effect loop where intelligent apes sprang from a pair of intelligent apes who traveled back in time). In a nutshell, Dr. Rodman (James Franco) is working on a cure for Alzheimer's when he discovers a concoction that heightens cognitive functions in chimps. When he tests it on his ailing father (John Lithgow), it displays enormous promise, but not as much as it does with little Caeser, a chimp born of their most promising test case. The original batch of super-goo proves unstable, however, and Franco is sacked. Fast-forward a few years (and throw in Frieda Pinto as a love interest, because, hey, she is really really beautiful), and Caesar is now adolescent sized, and incredibly smart. An incident with a snotty neighbor lands him in what is essentially an ape jail (run by Brian Cox and the dude who played Draco Malfoy, so you know it's a bad joint), and Caesar, by dint of his intelligence, takes over the place. From there it's just a hop, skip, and a jump to the apes running the planet, although we'll be saving that for future installments (watch the credits, you'll see what I'm referring to).The Apes movies in their initial run were really more about what humans feared, and apparently in the Seventies what we feared is that we would screw things up and wreck the world and someone else would take our place at the top of the evolutionary ladder. Now that most of that has come to pass (save for the top of the ladder bit), it turns out what we are most afraid of now is that in trying to avert some horrible disease, we will screw things up and wreck the world and someone else will take our place at the top of the evolutionary ladder (well, again, in the next movie they will portray the actual taking our place bit). Whereas in the earlier version of the saga we shot ourselves in the foot with nuclear weapons, here we shoot ourselves in the foot because of greed and big pharma, which again, is a tad more realistic (though nuclear Armageddon was not so far-fetched in 1970). The story approach is different, but the underlying fears remain.Much like in the original, the human actors are almost completely disposable; we spend a lot of time with Franco, but he could be any well-meaning shmuck, and Lithgow, while he's very good, is merely a maguffin to create the super-ape serum (the rest of the humans, even the radiant Pinto, are utterly forgettable). The take on the apes is different – here they look much more ape-like, and less like humans in prosthetics, although honestly I loved the 60s/70s apes (and so did Oscar, they won an award for inventive make-up). The guy who played Gollum played Caesar as an adult, and of course he's crazy good and convincing in his movements; that helps sell the believability of the film. But even with flawless effects, I felt there was something missing from this version of the story, some element that sold me on the other, admittedly lower-tech and cheesier version, that did not sell me here. Maybe it was the casually boring treatment of man being mean to lower animals, or maybe it was just that it took way the hell too long to get things going; but this movie, while technologically impressive, has no heart. We don't bond with Caesar the way we bonded with Roddy McDowall's version of him; he seems a cold and cunning conqueror, almost more of a villain than a hero (while he rejects the evil humans, naturally, he also rejects the embrace of the one who loves him, which I understood from a plot point but nonetheless found curious). Caesar is less a protagonist to root for than a warning that it will likely be some innocent bystander we hardly give a second thought to who will eventually topple our way of life. He was far too callous for me to embrace. I also didn't care for the slapdash ending, where the apes find temporary sanctuary after besting a squad of policemen. So? The next day they'd simply be gassed, end of story (or it would be if not for the financial allure of potential sequels, which is why they keep trying to revive this franchise).I didn't find it a bad film, but I did find it an oddly cold and sterile one, and admit to being a tad perplexed as to why, technological achievements aside, everyone seemed so taken with it; granted, we humans are simply living high on the hog in an epoch between glacial periods (most likely), but I don't really find the notion that we will be displaced one that deserves much cheering. I find the whole premise kind of creepy, myself. Maybe without McDowall's humanity underneath it all there's some spark lacking in these new apes – one I would label empathy. You'll certainly be impressed by the effects in this film, but I was left cold by the story.",5,5,8,2 January 2012
Ghost Rider," Dopey fun
","I didn't go to this movie expecting much, really; it looked dopey in the trailers, but that never stopped me before (Torque, etc.). Mostly I went because I read a piece on Friday where Nic Cage ripped Entertainment Weekly a new one, and that made me want to spend $6 to support him regardless of the vehicle he was in.Ghost Rider is yet another film that owes its existence to the baffling success of the lunk-headed Spiderman films; without Spidey's grotesque box office returns, many superhero movies wouldn't have been greenlighted (greenlit?), and this one probably would have been one of them. Would the world be much worse off for its absence? Not really.GR follows the story of Johnny Blaze (Cage), a young man who sells his soul to the Devil (Peter Fonda) to save the life of his dad. When the Devil comes to collect years later, he transforms Blaze into the Ghost Rider, a bounty hunter, to hunt down the Devil's enemies, in this case one Blackheart (Wes Bentley), who happens to be the Devil's son. Oh, and thrown in for good measure and eye candy is Johnny's long lost love Roxanne (Eva Mendes).It's a dopey movie. While nowhere near as mind-numbingly stupid as, say, Ultraviolet, GR seems to understand that it's not Shakespeare (unlike Batman Begins) and wisely never even tries to be anything more than a popcorn flick. Cage is a good choice for an admittedly oddball one-note superhero; his own natural quirkiness makes Blaze a lot more likable (even if the romance with Mendes seems a stretch). Cage walks the line between playing it goofy and playing it too goofy  he never makes fun of the material, and indeed, he seems to embrace it, enjoying himself with it and plainly hoping you'll do the same.The rest of the casting is fine. Fonda growls and seethes as the devil, and Bentley is acceptable as his even more evil, rebellious son. Donal Logue is well cast as Mack, Blaze's buddy and partner, and Sam Elliot is perfect as a sort of old west mentor to Cage's Ghost Rider. Rounding out (literally) the cast is Eva Mendes, who strikes the same note of bemused sincerity as Cage (she gets the best laugh in the film), and whose cleavage is the source of constant camera attention.Ghost Rider is dopey fun. I've often said if I have to turn my brain off to enjoy something it's not worth it, but this movie proves a little mindless fun is sometimes just what the doctor ordered. It's only a notch or two above a cartoon, but GR knows that, and revels in it, and because of that, it works. Certainly worth a rental if the weather is prohibiting you from hitting the theaters just now.February 19, 2007",5,0,1,19 February 2007
The Incredibles," Not all that incredible
","Pixar's latest offering, The Incredibles, takes a stab at the superhero genre. Saying it's better than most superhero films isn't saying much; is it really a feat to produce a better film than Daredevil, Hellboy, or Catwoman? The Incredibles does have a nice twist working for it: what if, like some demented Alan Moore comic, the supers were no longer welcome to do their job and had to settle for being normal people? How would they respond to that? That's the basic gist of The Incredibles, and we focus mostly on Mr. Incredible, aka Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson), who is definitely having trouble fitting in. His wife Helen (aka Elasti-Girl, voiced by Holly Hunter) is having an easier time of it. But when an opportunity to go adventuring again knocks on Bob's door, he furtively accepts it, not thinking through the consequences or asking too many questions.By now Pixar has perfected their production abilities. Everything is flawlessly fashioned, and that other world they are able to create, while never before quite so close to our own, is still very convincing here. Though we see few other heroes (pretty much only Frozone, voiced by Samuel T. Jackson), we are given enough of the 'super' world to make everything believable. Pixar tends to excel at world-building, and since this film was handled by the talented Brad Bird, you'd expect nothing less.The problem is, there's a certain indefinable something missing from The Incredibles. It's fun, mostly, and enjoyable, and pretty well paced most of the time; it gets a bit talky in stretches, and the multiple attempts at an ending irritated me (just end the movie already, Brad!). The villain Syndrome (voiced by Jason Lee but damned if he doesn't look and sound like Mark Hamill) was well-thought out, even if his major scheme is lifted lock, stock, and barrel from The Watchmen. But unlike other Pixar films, this one seems to lack a little heart. The family scenes with the Parrs are all nice, and the kids Dash and Violet are well-realized, mostly (Dash gets all the best action scenes, especially the one stolen from Return of the Jedi). But this movie lacks that special spark that say, Finding Nemo or especially Toy Story had. At the end of both of those films, I felt a wealth of emotion that actually moved me (Toy Story 2 especially); here, there was nothing, just a recognition that the story had come to a nice place to end. That's not bad, and there's nothing wrong with it, but it certainly doesn't live up to the other Pixar movies (except Bug's Life, which I never cared for).It doesn't help that it feels like you've seen so much of this before. Granted, there are so many superhero films, cartoons, and comic books that we've been inundated with variations on the idea. But while The Incredibles handles the genre reasonably well, there was a LOT of it that reminded me of other movies or stories, and thus at times it felt predictable (which you simply couldn't say about Nemo or either of the Toy Stories). Frozone is nothing more than a well-rendered Iceman; and while Elasti-Girl is pretty original, Mr. Incredible is simply the answer to the question, 'What if you had too much Clark Kent and not enough Superman?' and that's been explored a LOT, given that Clark's had two TV shows in the past decade.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film. Dash's action scenes are all a great deal of fun, and the Brad-Bird-voice fashion designer, Edna Mode is hysterical  really the best character in the whole thing. But Syndrome the villain is hackneyed, even down to the underground lair and the pseudo femme-fatale henchwoman; if you were going to do a fresh twist on the super-hero genre, why rely on so many clichés? Ultimately The Incredibles is a fun diversion, but little more. A lot of movies would be happy just to achieve that, but given Pixar's track record honestly I was expecting a little more. Certainly it's worth going to see The Incredibles in the theater, you'll have fun, it's just not the keeper that Pixar's other films are and doesn't merit a place on your DVD shelf like their other movies. Or like Shark Tale.",6,1,3,7 November 2004
Hero," Pretty fluff
","Of the many films of Akira Kurosawa that yet loom large in the creative consciousness of filmmakers around the globe, I remain the least impressed with Rashomon. While it is a fine enough film, I find it to be overshadowed by most of Kurosawa's other efforts. Apparently I'm in the minority on that view, because Rashomon is tirelessly copied again and again, usually without much skill or success.Hero is one of the more recent attempts to take the old formula (Rashomon is around five decades old now) and do something creative with it. Jet Li stars as the Nameless One, a super bad-ass who defeats three assassins who wish to kill the King of Qin (Daoming Chen), who wishes to conquer the warring states of pre-China and unite the country in one great realm. All of the film is actually told in flashback, revealed in a conversation between these two characters. We see the same sequence of events three times, with precious little variation between them plotwise.And I suspect the makers of Hero knew this. The film is extraordinarily short on substance and very long on style  not always a bad thing, but unless you're extremely deft, you're going to get caught, and to my mind, they do here. Taking a cue from the Back to the Future films, the Hero folk realized if you're going to watch the same thing over and over again, it had better be really pretty. And that's where the strength of Hero lies. The visuals are sumptuous and stunning; we are treated to mono-color designs (that must have been computer enhanced) that absorb the eye in vibrant pools of color. Save for the Nameless One's fight against the first assassin, Long Sky (Donnie Yen), every other flashback is told in a single but different hue; one time all the clothes and sets are blue; another green, and still another (and the most striking), red; and so on. This provides some breathtaking visuals, and is really quite very well done. But unfortunately, it still remains expertly executed window-dressing on a paper-thin plot. If half the attention had been paid to the story as was lavished on the visuals (and casting: Maggie Cheung, Tony Leung, and Zhang Ziyi show up as well), then Hero could have been much more than just extremely pretty eye-candy. But it's not.",5,0,0,30 August 2004
Garden State," Wonderfully done film, just right
","Garden State, masterminded by young Zach Braff (you might know him from Scrubs), is everything that every indie movie aspires to but so very few achieve; it's warm, it's funny, it's quirky and ironic, it's sad and hopeful and touching all at once. It manages to poke fun at life without being disillusioned, it offers hope without being saccharine, and it manages to reach right off the screen and touch us. I'm not often emotionally engaged by films I see these days, but I certainly was with Garden State.Much of the credit obviously has to go to Braff; since he wrote, starred in, and directed it, it pretty much only could be his fault if things went wrong. But Braff gives a flawless performance as Andrew Largeman, a 26-year old who has largely become disconnected from the world and has to fly home for his mother's funeral. The movie starts a little jerkily, though Braff is appealing from the start. But not long into the movie Andrew encounters Sam (Natalie Portman), and there the movie really finds its legs. Portman and Braff have an unusual and touching chemistry, and if anything, she's even sharper than he is, if that's possible. Portman has several scenes where she is so natural that it hardly feels like acting at all; and despite the fact that her notable features have been pasted all over the world from Star Wars, her Sam is so engaging and lively you forget that you're even watching anyone perform. In that Braff equals her, and they are a perfect match.I won't get into much of the plot for fear of spoiling anything, because the movie is far too good for that. But Braff manages the right balance between irony and humor, and his warmth with Portman really shines through on the screen. As Andrew begins to come alive, the movie grows even stronger, and there are a few moments toward the end that are just pulled off perfectly. I especially liked the very end, which is always the hardest part of a film (or any story) to get right.I know, I know, I'm overhyping it; but in fact, I'm not really doing the movie much justice at all. This is the most moved I've been by a film since Lost in Translation, and that's rare company indeed. I know Garden State isn't playing everywhere, but if it is showing near you, you might want to make an effort to see it; movies like this are a very rare bunch, that can touch us and maybe even change us a little. Don't wait to see it on DVD.",10,0,1,21 August 2004
Mission: Impossible II," First candidate for worst film of the year.
","I liked the first MI film, but this shoddy, thoughtless sequel bears no resemblance to that movie. The characters here have no depth and no motivation; puppets of the plot, they traipse around meaninglessly blowing stuff up and staring at the camera with great intensity. The plot is boring and hackneyed and no one thought to give the villain any motivation at all. The pacing is monotonously slow -- it takes forever to get through even the supposedly fast-paced action sequences -- and director Woo tries for artsy with the action but ends up with messy. To be avoided at all costs",1,0,1,29 May 2000
The Insider," Strong performances overcome uneven direction.
","Michael Mann's unfocused and tepid direction is not enough to kill this film, gladly, because Russell Crowe gives a strong performance and Pacino is at the very top of his game here. It's hard to single out any Pacino performance as being one of his best -- he's had so many -- but this one is certainly up there. Chris Plummer is also very good as Mike Wallace. But the movie is worth checking out for Pacino alone.",7,0,0,16 April 2000
The Mummy Returns," This movie has *everything.*
","A perfect sequel is a rare bird, but 'The Mummy Returns' is just that, taking all the elements that made the first film a joy and ramping them up to sheer delight in this film. All returning characters are wonderful and have grown in ways faithful to their initial incarnation; and all the new characters are engaging, interesting, and fun. The action sequences are all terrifically well thought out, and the plot is huge and epic and sweeping. It's nice to see a summer film with such grand designs. What makes the film truly excel is the wonderful attention to small details as well as big, and the way multiple storylines are woven together seamlessly. Steven Sommers deservedly has another big hit on his hands. This film raises the bar on Summer 2001. It's doubtful anything will be able to compete on a quality level with this film this summer.",10,0,0,5 May 2001
National Treasure," Light geeky fun well worth your money
","In these post-X-Files days in which we live, where the government is run largely by greedy idiots, it can be a sore temptation to imbue our founding fathers with even greater intelligence and insight than they had (or as Bono once said, 'You glorify the past/ when the future dries up'). Now, granted, we had an uncommonly selfless and outstanding group of men working together to start America, but I don't know that they were all shifty Freemasons who hid the greatest treasure ever assembled in the history of mankind and then left painstakingly obscure clues as to where they had done so.But that's entirely the premise of National Treasure, the new Bruckheimer opus that opened this weekend. Treasure centers around one Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nick Cage) as he tries to track down said treasure, a family obsession dating back to the early nineteenth century. Abetting him on this madman's quest is requisite computer geek Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) and equally requisite skeptical eye candy Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger, who started the Greatest War Story Ever Told in this summer's Troy). Of course we know that Gates must be on to something, not only because no one believes him (not even his dad Patrick, played by Jon Voight) except the villain Ian Howe (Sean Bean), but because, well, you wouldn't have much of a story without the treasure now, would you?Treasure is not only an above-average sleuth/treasure hunt movie, it's also a history lesson. You get to learn all sorts of historical facts (like Ben Franklin arguing for the inception of daylight savings time) along with the light action, which for me, anyway, doubled the fun. Someone obviously loved their history; the tidbits are scattered throughout, often interspersed with plot points, and look at the names of the principles: the evil Englishman is named Howe, Ben's dad is named after Patrick Henry, etc. It's kind of a history geek thing, but I thought it was fun.What I most liked about the movie, though, was that the heroes are all smart. Cage's Gates is a historical encyclopedia, but he's also sharp-witted (if a bit absent minded). It's nice to see a geek hero, and Cage fits the role very well (Poole and Chase are much the same, her sleek good looks notwithstanding). Cage gives his hero a passion for both history and the hunt, and his earnestness helps give the movie an added bit of believability and seriousness that playing it tongue-in-cheek would have ruined. Bartha treads the same line with Poole, though he gets most of the best comedy lines. Kruger, who will probably never be mistaken for a great actress, is fine here, even if her Abigail does shuck a lifetime's worth of law abidance to the wind in just under an hour to aid the man who steals the Declaration of Independence. But once Abby's on his side, she, like the boys, uses her considerable wits to help figure it all out.The plot and the clues are a little needlessly complex, but they are woven into the dialogue with some skill. We never feel like we're getting a history lesson (or at least I didn't, but then I'm partial to history as a subject), but we're given all the information we need to solve the riddle along with Gates. Yeah, some of the plot twists are a tad outlandish; Ben Franklin made a special pair of eyeglasses that still work two hundred years later after being sealed inside a hollow brick on an external wall? And so on. But Treasure isn't trying to be a serious brain flick, it's trying to be a slightly updated version of Raiders of the Lost Ark. And for my money, it succeeds.National Treasure is a great deal of fun. Cage, who's been doing deeper films of late, has never been more fun or likable than he is here, and he was perfect for the role. It's not the most solid film of its ilk this year  that would have to be Bourne Supremacy-but Treasure can hold its own and entertain you while doing it. Well worth the price of admission to watch Cage and Co. traipse around the east coast acting one part Mission Impossible and two parts History's Detectives.",8,0,0,21 November 2004
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Finally back on track
","Given the monstrous popularity of the book series, the Harry Potter films have always had sort of a tough act to follow; as the teen wizard's adventures have continued, the books have become darker, more complex, and a little bit more adult. Though the third installment, Prisoner of Azkaban, tried hard to move the films in that direction, it was a mostly unpalatable attempt, and I wondered if any of the later films would ever be able to stack up to the first two, which are admittedly light hearted (and obsessively faithful adaptations). In addition Goblet of Fire remains my favorite book, in my opinion the piece where Rowling is at the height of her literary prowess. So, for me, this movie had the deck stacked against it.But director Mike Newell seems to understand the material a lot better than predecessor Alfonso Cuaron (whom many people lauded because he's an indie darling, not because he did a good job with the franchise, because, frankly, he didn't); there's far more humor, more done with the characters, and a sense that every attempt was made to stay closer to the book than last year's disappointing outing. Of course with a book almost 900 pages long you had to expect some cuts in the material, but this time those choices were made wisely and judiciously.Once again we find Harry, Ron, and Hermione returning to school at the start of the film, but the double treat of no Dursleys and the Quidditch World Cup (some of Rowling's best material ever) kick off the movie in high fashion; a pity we're yanked out of it so soon, but again, 900 pages of ground to cover. The big plot twist this time is that Harry must compete against young wizards from other schools in a dangerous contest known as the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Rowling's world expands from a predominantly English metaphor to include the French and Bulgarians as well, and the results are very satisfying, just as they were in the book.Newell does his best to stay true to the material, putting the kids back in their class robes for most of the movie and adding tons of generous little touches to the film (reaction shots are a specialty, from Hermione's disgust at the boys' very positive response to the arrival of the French maidens to Harry dribbling water down his chin as he locks eyes with his object d'amour, Cho Chen. This sense of playful humor so prevalent in the books was almost wholly absent in the last film and was a welcome addition to this one.The casting was superb, even by the usual high Potter series standards (it's unlikely they will ever top Ken Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart). Mad-Eye Moody, one of my favorite characters in all the books, was vividly brought to life by Brendan Gleeson; Moody is a constant crotchety joy throughout the whole film. Also looking the part very well, though admittedly given little to do, were Stanislav Ianevski as Viktor Krum and Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory; both were able to capture their characters in a few simple turns. Less satisfying was Clémence Poésy as Fleur Delacour; Poésy came off completely flat and unappealing, baffling given the high quality of the other casting and really the first let-down in the entire series as that sort of thing goes.The leads (Dan Radcliffe as Harry, Emma Watson as Hermione, and Rupert Grint as Ron) are all getting a bit long in the tooth to pass for their ages, which I felt with the last movie as well. Ron looks in his early twenties, and while Hermione mostly passes (Watson only outstrips her character by a year or two now), Radcliffe is no longer a boy, he's a man (if there were any doubt, a scene where he lingers topless in a bath  to the very ardent delight of the teenaged girl behind me in the theater  puts any debate on the matter to rest). By the time Rowling finishes book seven and they get around to the movie in 2008-9, the kids will seem old enough to be their own parents.The production design deserves a note  particularly effective and appealing this time, from the smart French outfits to the especially well-rendered Durmstrang suits, coats, and furry hats, a clever amalgamation of Baltic, Russian, and old world design that evokes many cultures in general but none in specific. Excellent work.The film runs more than two and a half hours, but it moves at such a breakneck pace that it feels just a tad over two. Though Potter maniacs (Pottheads?) might whine about this or that detail being overlooked, face it, some of it had to go, and Newell and company keep the emotional core of the work intact, which is the most important thing. Though critics keep calling it 'dark,' I found the movie high-spirited and engaging, pulling me into its alternate world the way the first two did (and the books excelled at). Though it'll be tough to top the first two films, Goblet of Fire proves a worthy successor to the Potter tradition, a film certainly worth your time to go and see this holiday season.",9,0,3,20 November 2005
Castle in the Sky," The greatest animated film of all time
","It's always difficult to put a stamp on any film as being 'the best,' whether of all time, a certain genre, or what have you, but I believe a strong argument could be made that in fact, Laputa is the greatest animated film ever made. It is in my mind the masterwork of Hayao Miyazaki, the most talented of Japan's animated directors, and it best captures his strengths as a director, storyteller, and designer, as well as encapsulating all of his favorite underlying themes. The version I'm reviewing is the 2003 American dub (I know, sacrilege for a hard-core anime fan to not watch it in its native language); there is at least one other English language dub out there, I have it on VHS (I have no idea from what source), and that version is the single best dub I have ever encountered of any film. But I thought it better to concentrate on the version people can actually find.Laputa tells the story of a boy named Pazu (voiced by James Van Der Beek here), who's growing up in a mining town when one day a young girl named Sheeta (Anna Paquin) literally drops from the sky. It seems she is being pursued by a sinister government agent, Colonel Muska (Mark Hamill), who is more interested in the magical crystal that hangs around her neck. To keep things lively, there's also a wickedly funny pirate gang after the crystal, led by the aging but still boisterous Dola (Cloris Leachman). The plot revolves around the crystal's ability to reveal the location of the fabled flying city of Laputa, a potential treasure trove of scientific knowledge and hidden treasure. It's all very much in keeping with a fairy-tale setting, but Miyazaki knows exactly how far to take the story, and the plot is peppered with 'gosh-wow' moments and threaded with his customary morality and warnings about abusing the power of nature.The design work on Laputa, nearly twenty years later, is still revolutionary. Flying machines of all sorts abound, utterly impossible but so meticulously designed that you instantly accept them without blinking. The world is set somewhere around the start of the twentieth century, with telegraphs and ancient motorcars alongside those wonderful impossible flying machines. But it is the city itself that is sheer brilliance in execution; Laputa is both the Garden of Eden and the Fire of Heaven itself, and in that juxtaposition lies its appeal, its power, and its danger.Besides being a thoughtfully designed and beautifully rendered film, Laputa is blessed with a wonderful sense of cinematography. From sweeping flying shots to high speed chases on tiny one-man flyers to ships submerging into the clouds as if they were water, Laputa displays a scope that most films  even with the magic of CGI  can only daydream about. Though we only see a small fraction of this world, its simple elegance extends beyond the borders of the frame and we have no trouble believing in it. The film also contains one of my favorite, if not the most exciting, action sequences ever: a guardian robot that fell to Earth is accidentally reactivated and wreaks havoc on the fortress it is kept in, all the while trying to protect Sheeta (who was the one who woke it up). Meanwhile, Pazu and the pirates swoop in on their little flying machines to snatch her, literally, from the jaws of destruction. From the horrific sight of the robot incinerating the countryside to the exhilarating last-second rescue, the entire sequence is a masterpiece of timing and camera angles and knowing exactly how far to take the audience.It helps that Laputa has an amazing score. Composer Joe Hisaishi captures the wondrous beauty of this world, the dewy innocence, the exciting action, and the creepy otherworldliness of the flying city and its bizarre robot guardians. Though he re-recorded it for this DVD release (which IMO is not an improvement over his original score), adding pieces here and there, the score matches the visuals perfectly, a rare total union of sound and vision.This isn't a bad dub. I'm inordinately fond of the older English dub, and this one over-explains things just a tad in spots, but I was almost shocked how closely these voices matched those (and those matched the Japanese pretty well). Dola in particular is hard to get right, but Leachman is spot on as the fiery old pirate woman (her sons aren't quite as good as the original). Paquin does a good job as Sheeta, and Mark Hamill, while I knew it was him early, is more than talented enough to do Muska (I liked the other English dub of Muska a little more, but Hamill's good). Much of the film rests on Pazu's shoulders, and Van Der Beek is wonderful. Listening to him made me think this crew must have had access to the other English dub, because VDB matches up very closely with the original Pazu. Although again watching a dub is grounds for excommunication among the otaku faithful, as much as I love this film, I don't think you're sacrificing a great deal simply watching this particular Anglicized version. John Lassiter of Pixar introduces it up front, and my suspicion is that he, like so many others, simply love this film so much that they tried very hard to ensure its high quality.Miyazaki has had success in America in recent years with Spirited Away and Mononoke (one of his few films I didn't care for), but to me Laputa is still his crowning achievement. Anyone familiar with his later work will almost certainly enjoy this earlier work, and again, this film is a master at the top of his form hitting on every cylinder. I'd pay big money to be able to see this on a large screen; while that will probably never happen, it's good to know that at least this classic has been preserved on DVD.",10,29,32,2 March 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Other than the stars a waste of your time
","The film's concept is a derivative of the wildly uneven True Lies, only this time both husband and wife lead a boring double life instead of just one partner. And that's about as deep as we get. We've got Brad! We've got Angelina! Who needs anything else? Okay, so the film isn't the disgusting train wreck that Bewitched probably will be (notice the strong shift in the ad campaign, anyone?), but it's a long, long way from what it could have been. True Lies worked because Arnie played the role to perfection, the division between his real life and his work life was well done, and, frankly, Tom Arnold gave his best performance ever.Here, we don't have the skill that movie took to make. Of course, while I'm no huge James Cameron fan, he at least knows how to direct. The same cannot be said of indie fave Doug Liman (Go and Swingers, two utterly reprehensible films), whom you'd think would have learned something about spy flicks from working on TWO Bourne movies, but no. Care to make it worse? The screenwriter (and that term is used in a very loose sense), Simon Kinberg, was the 'script doctor' for Elektra and Charlie's Angels 2. In any country where I made the laws, they could put you to death for such gross incompetent mangling of the English language (those movies had script doctors? Hollywood really is in an advanced state of decline).Smith tries to balance the line between action film and comedy and fails at both. The lines aren't funny (there's a very few chuckles) and the action is all rote, things blowing up and tons of bad guys flying through the air. At least John and Jane (no kidding, those are the character's names) get a little bloody, but not much. Can't distract people from that glamour make-up and lighting.Which is too bad, because Pitt and Jolie are two of the most likable stars on the screen these days, and their pairing should have set off sparks (it does occasionally, but with much less wattage than you would expect). A potentially hilarious scene after they learn the truth of each other's identities and set about exposing all the lies they've told is bungled by having it take place in the middle of an extended and uninteresting car chase. Much like action, dialogue requires a certain rhythm to work at its best; but why should the man who 'script doctored' Elektra know anything about writing? In the end Smith is mere Hollywood pap; show the flyovers some pretty faces, blow some stuff up, make them laugh a little bit, give them a few sexy scenes to fantasize about. Smith isn't a reprehensible film  the mere presence of Pitt and Jolie pretty much negates that possibility  but it is shockingly hollow given what it could have been. Even these two stars can't elevate this film to much more than watchable, sadly enough. With the right (or any) writing, directing, and editing, this could have been a fun movie. Pity it's not.",3,7,16,11 June 2005
War of the Worlds," Excellent, excellent movie
","This version of War of the Worlds manages to keep much of the book intact while grafting on a modern sensibility. Spielberg also manages to put his stamp on the story while retaining the feel of the original. In brief Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) is a father in a split family where mom is doing much better. Ray, pretty much a teenager all grown up physically, has the kids for the weekend when, wouldn't you know it, the Martians invade.As usual, Spielberg is a master of building suspense. This film reminded me in spots of Jaws, still in my opinion his masterpiece, with its gradual build-up of horror and its ability to impart upon you the vague feeling that something is wrong without actually telling you what it is. The slow unraveling of the Martian threat, coupled with the terrifying visual when you first see the tripods, is startling; the visual of the heat ray is monstrously effective, and the Martian calling noise  described as 'ul-la' in the book but sounding more like an evil foghorn here  is frightening.Spielberg blends the family stuff  strongly played by Cruise and Dakota Fanning  and the terror very well; one scene where Ray loses his cool because he doesn't know what to do is excellent. The man-child has to grow up suddenly, and Cruise conveys his frustration well. Toward the middle of the film the horror takes over completely as civilization succumbs to the onslaught, and we are treated to ghastly scenes of the sinister tripods striding above us, towering overlords bent on destroying us. Every ounce of the horror Wells was trying to invoke is preserved on screen.But there is another level that makes War an effective film, and that is the analogy to 9/11. We are living our lives as ordinary citizens when a monstrous event happens; an enemy we did not foresee and cannot understand strikes at our very way of life; we are powerless to fight back (indeed one of the strongest scenes in the film is the doomed attempt by the military to stop the tripods); and we never truly understand what they want or why they have chosen to attack us. Images that mirror that awful day pop up in the film; a dust-encrusted Ray stumbles like a zombie into his house; people run pell mell, not knowing what to do, as the city falls all around them; hordes of people run across the bridge, an almost perfect reflection of what we saw on the news that Tuesday night. While Spielberg is perfectly capable of creating horror all on his own, his skillful tapping into our collective psyche notches up the fear factor even higher. For much of the film there's so much tension that you're on the edge of your seat.The acting is all excellent  from Cruise to Fanning to Tim Robbins playing the composite character of the parson/the tunneler (two scenes from the book are merged, but it works fine, even if the Martians come off as a tad dim). Everyone reacts to these horrifying events in a completely believable fashion (again, sadly, we have a real-life precedent), and aside from a little Spielberg treacle at the end, they achieve a consistent emotional state of teetering on the edge of panic  not easy to maintain.This is a very strong picture. Spielberg is clearly at home in this piece, able to flex muscles he hasn't used in a while. The film entertains and frightens on a number of levels and is wholly satisfying. The only weak part comes at the end, where Spielberg gives a little too much of an up-beat, and the plot lets us down a tad - but that's Wells' fault, not Spielberg's, and far better to adhere to the original than have the hero take out the alien armada in a clumsy ham-handed fashion (ala ID4). War would be best seen on the big screen  the terror would not be as effective and pervasive on your TV. Do yourself a favor and see this in the movies; it'll probably end up being the best movies of the summer, and it's well worth your $7.50 to see.",8,2,5,11 July 2005
Man on Fire," A nice change of pace for Denzel
","Granted, I saw this as an in-flight movie, so I probably didn't get the full experience -- though my audio was fine, my video consisted of two choices -- a seven-inch screen twenty feet away with proper color or one four feet away at an angle where everything is tainted greenish-brown, or wholly inverted color, so dark blues show up as pale greys, and so on. Adds a wrinkle to the viewing experience, to say the least, and they told us up front the movie had edited for screen size, content, and time. And they weren't kidding; the credits rolled as we were just about to land (I half-worried they would cut off the finale).All that in mind, Man is still a pretty good film. Denzel Washington plays Creasey, a hard-edged ex-agent who's seen better days and is set up by his pal Rayburn (Christopher Walken) for some bodyguard duty in Mexico, where apparently kids are kidnapped with alarming frequency. While Creasey is kind of a crab, the child, Pita (Dakota Fanning) is enjoyably precocious, but in a good way. Her infectious good humor rubs off on Creasey, who slowly begins to crawl out of his shell when of course she is kidnapped.
Most of the rest of the film chronicles Creasey's efforts to resolve the situation, with varying degrees of inventiveness and violence (though I imagine some of the worse violence was trimmed from my version), and surprise, surprise, Denzel is incredibly effective in the type of role you associate more with someone like DeNiro. Denzel plays the hard-ass amazingly well, and he gives the role a nice subtle emotional undercurrent. Walken is good, but he's not in the movie enough for my liking -- a little more of him would have gone a long way. Fortunately Denzel gets to play off Dakota Fanning, so we can understand his quick bonding with the girl. Fanning is her usual excellent self (she's given more terrific turns than most actresses ever do, and she's what, eleven? What a future she could have!) and her Pita is really easy to like.The film is violent, but not more so than most R-rated fare, and at least it offers some character and emotional context to go with all the explosions and gunshots. While Man might not be everyone's cup of tea, itâs certainly worth a rental if you get the chance.",7,0,0,24 July 2004
Jaws," A perfect film
","It's almost impossible to give an objective review of this film  a cultural phenomenon, the first modern Hollywood blockbuster, the movie that propelled Steven Spielberg to iconic status and was the progenitor of that horrible cinematic trend known as 'franchising.' Nonetheless, as I watched it yet again last Sunday, I realized I had never actually reviewed this film, and as I spend enough time poring over bad and mediocre films, it would be a nice change to review a good  nay, a great  one.Set in the resort community of Amity, Jaws follows the story of what happens to the town when a shark comes hunting and threatens their precious summer economy. Of course there's much more than that going on; it's also the personal story of Sheriff Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) a man living on an island who's afraid of the water, and those who help him pursue the shark: oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and the colorful, cantankerous shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw).Spielberg sets up the film economically and effortlessly, sketching Amity with exactly the right details, rendering it familiar to us in an instant. From the Boy Scout water badge tests to the man badgering the chief about painting a red zone on the curb in front of his house, Amity is suburban anywhere, circa 1975, a small, quiet town of normal people whom Spielberg breathes to life with swift but textured strokes. Standing out amongst them is Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), whose interest in preserving the town's economy nearly leads it to ruin; but rather than render the mayor a one-dimensional villain, Spielberg gives him a moment of stark humanity in a scene in the hospital where he is so unnerved by a shark attack a few hours earlier that he absent-mindedly starts to smoke. He turns to Brody and hisses in a wavering voice, 'Martin, my kids were out there in that water too.' While Hooper joins the proceedings relatively early (in a hilarious scene where every fisherman in the northeast is launching their boat to try and nab the $3K reward on the shark) and is saddled with the lion's share of educating the audience about sharks (the exposition is seamlessly worked into three conversations between Hooper and Brody), Spielberg is wise to save Quint until the second half of the picture. Although he makes a brief cameo earlier (scratching his nails on a chalkboard to gain everyone's attention  how's that for an entrance?), once Quint is on board full time the movie really kicks into high gear. His disdain for Hooper's easy life and modern gear aside, Quint is like a character straight out of Hemmingway, and Shaw fleshes him out to perfection. In the hands of another director and actor, Quint probably would have been easy to dislike, but here, he steals the show from the other two men, and again, much like the mayor, he is given his scene of humanity, where he discloses that he was a crew member of the USS Indianapolis, the ship that was torpedoed by the Japanese on a highly secret mission to deliver the atom bomb.Spielberg masterfully follows the heroic plot arc in this movie. The hero's simple village is threatened by an external force it cannot understand or defeat; outsiders are brought in, even while the hero must face his own inner fears and 'grow up' to conquer them. Quint is the transitional hero here, an outsider in the community (even though he resides in Amity), whose anti-social nature and unwillingness to compromise permanently exclude him from the village; we know as soon as his boat is ruined that he will die, for now he has no home, no place to live (can we really picture Quint sitting at the Brody dinner table as Hooper did?).Of course it's not just the brilliantly executed structure of Jaws that makes it so great; the performances are all spot-on, terrific; all three of the main actors shine here, and even tiny bit parts are played perfectly. Spielberg also uses terror more effectively here than he ever has since; while apparently the mechanical shark wouldn't work and he had to disguise it in filming and editing, not seeing the menace for most of the film heightens the suspense and terror far more than revealing it would have.This film is Spielberg firing on all cylinders, every piece in place, a masterpiece from start to finish. It's rare that you encounter a perfect film, and that's a phrase I don't even like to use; but it certainly fits Jaws, which is as flawless a piece of movie-making as you will ever encounter. It's a good bet most of you have seen it (it is thirty-one years old, after all), but if you haven't seen it in a while, maybe it's time to get reacquainted with a classic once more.",10,1,3,18 August 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A satisfying note to go out on
","Revenge of the Sith is the last Star Wars film George Lucas will suffer to make, unless he changes his mind or he needs the money (both of which seem remote at this time). But Lucas knew that going into this, I believe, and he also knew that this would be the last film he made that anyone wanted to see in his lifetime (I don't believe Indy 4 will ever get made. You can if you wish; I don't). That being said, there is always a certain aspect to any work of art when the artist knows it will be his last great offering, much like a farewell tour or a final exhibition. There's a little bit of ego involved, a little bit of nostalgia, and an insistence on hearkening back to earlier, better times, when things were shiny and new and you didn't know all this was coming to a close.The need to tie things up hangs palpably over this movie, and there are many references to Lucas' other films (and a few clumsy ones to films outside the trilogy). Sometimes with this Lucas goes monstrously overboard (the last fifteen minutes busy themselves with trying to resolve every single plot hole fans have been whining about for six years), and sometimes he hits the mark dead on.In brief, the film follows the last days of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Galactic Empire  all the stuff Lucas glossed over in the backstory to the first Star Wars film now visited in detail. Specifically the movie concerns itself with Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side, his rebirth as Darth Vader, and the reasons that cause him to do so. There's a lot of flash and spectacle, a lot of action and battle scenes, and some shockingly beautiful scenery and design work. But is it any good? Well, there's a lot going on. You have several plots that need tying up, and Lucas tries his best to get to all of them. The main focus is on the dramas between Anakin (Hayden Christiansen) and Padme (Natalie Portman) and Anakin and the Chancellor/Emperor (Ian McDiarmid). Another major player is, of course, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), and Yoda, the digithespian who gets a fair amount of screen time. Jimmy Smits is on hand as Bail Organa, all around sympathetic helpful guy, and Samuel L. Jackson gets to glare and brood as Mace Windu.While there's lots of action and some of it is way over the top (General Grievous, a CGI cyborg, has a wheelie vehicle that is so ludicrous it belongs in a Transformers cartoon), the movie's heart, oddly, is not in its fleet combat or even its lightsaber duels, but rather in its drama. This is an odd choice for Lucas, who has never especially excelled in that department, but here he has to show us exactly why Anakin turns, and despite my fears, he pulls it off, and pulls it off pretty well. The Anakin/Padme relationship that was so stale in Episode 2 pretty much works here, and Anakin, even while slipping into evil, is far more interesting and compelling than he ever was before. His friendship with Obi-Wan is also explored, again, with surprisingly satisfying results. It doesn't hurt that McGregor, Christiansen and Portman are all talented actors, above this material; and while no one will confuse this with Shakespeare, for Lucas the emotional content was surprisingly effective and well done.It's a dark movie. Expect to see a lot of minor characters killed. Casual viewers won't even know who these people are, but die-hard fans will see their universe getting chopped apart, and it's not always fun (though the fall of the Jedi sequence was tightly edited and has great emotional impact. Seeing one young apprentice of about twelve battling a squad of troops in a futile gesture was particularly effective). The battle scenes, while pretty, are mostly chaotic and confusing, but at least we are given ample opportunity to see Anakin and Obi-Wan act like heroes rather than the immense dunces they were in the last film.Revenge is not a perfect film. It has some flaws, mostly, like Episode 2, where Lucas fails to show any restraint at all. But it also has some well done and powerful moments, and coming after the worst film in the franchise it is a bit of a relief that it's mostly a pretty well done film. Lucas' need not only to finish the story but to firmly establish the franchise as mythology  as if it weren't already  sometimes embellishes the proceedings, and sometimes gets in the way. There are moments that will have you shaking your head (one bit at the end is outrageously hackneyed and overdone), but there are more moments that will please you, and will achieve the goal of whisking you away to the galaxy far, far away one last time. If this is to be the final cinematic note of Star Wars, it's by far not the worst one Lucas could have chosen. The final image of the trilogy  an homage to the strongest scene in any of the six films  says it all; at once a fading, a looking back, and a looking forward to the future.",7,2,4,19 May 2005
The Terminal," Good, but could have been great
","The names Spielberg and Hanks are nearly synonymous with quality films, and certainly when teamed together (Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me if You Can). I was a tad surprised a movie like The Terminal was being released in the summer  when I first saw the trailer about a month ago I assumed it was a fall release  but this film ought to do well no matter what the season.The set-up is simple: Hanks plays Viktor Navorsky, a simple man from one of the break- away Russian Republics whose country collapses while he's in mid-air. Once he arrives in JFK, they don't know what to do with him; they can't send him back, and they can't let him in. He's a man without a country, and customs boss Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) is a die-hard by-the-book kind of guy who is determined not to break any laws in his handling of Navorsky's case. Along the way a stewardess falls into Viktor's life (literally) in the form of the dazzling Catherine-Zeta-Jones.The premise is somewhat thin, so we must rely primarily on Hanks to carry the picture by himself, which he's already proven he can do (Castaway, et al), and here he does not disappoint. Hanks is charming as Navorsky, who is a simple man caught in a complicated puzzle with no idea how to get himself out. Viktor makes friends with various workers at the terminal, and his interactions with them are amusing; he helps bring one couple together, and he gets to know another fugitive from a foreign land. His semi-relationship with Amelia (Jones) is very well done and thankfully has a few twists in it to make it a little unpredictable.Spielberg also does a lot with a movie that, let's face it, only has a few different sets, even if one of them is a sprawling mall complex. Unlike Viktor, we never feel confined by the movie, but we begin to see the airport as a self-contained little world, much as Viktor does. He continually turns adversity into opportunity, which helps to explain why being confined does not bother him so much.But Viktor is a little too good. He's honest, hard-working, helpful, unassuming  he's everything we Americans like to think we are but rarely manage to be in reality. As is usual in a Spielberg film, Viktor's benevolent attitude toward people ends up coming back to him in spades, and he ends up being a sort of unofficial hero of the terminal. But Viktor never breaks down or has a moment of anger (which would be natural in such a case) and his optimism never fades, not even for a second. While it's a nice performance by Hanks, Viktor's just a little too good to be true.Stanley Tucci also does an excellent job, but like many authority figures in Spielberg films, he's a little two-dimensional. He alone grows increasingly personally annoyed with Viktor's successes, one after the other, and he constantly tries to thwart the man. Dixon is the opposite of Viktor, a man unaware that his own negative actions will come back on him; but that rings a little hollow in a situation where Viktor is such the everyman that people can't help but be drawn to him. Only someone inhuman could fail to respond to the perfect Viktor, and Dixon's increasing anger comes off as a bit petulant after a while.The film is certainly worth going to see; there are some very funny and touching moments in it, and one sub-plot's resolution pleased me greatly toward the end. Hanks gives a winning performance and both Tucci and Jones are able to match him, no easy feat. But the film's a shade too black and white to be an emotional powerhouse; even one scene of Viktor losing his temper, even if he were all alone, would have helped. The Terminal is an enjoyable film, certainly worth going to see, but honestly I expected something a little more complicated and a little less obvious given the magnitude of the talent involved.",7,0,0,19 June 2004
Casino Royale," A decent film but this is not Bond
","Casino Royale is based on, by far, the most boring of Fleming's novels; though it serves as the introduction to Bond the character, in effect our hero does little but sit around smoking and playing cards. This movie remains painstakingly true to the book, for the most part, which is both a good and a bad thing in the long run. But Royale isn't trying to be a Bond film; in fact, it tries so hard to be an anti-Bond film that it hurts. The object behind this film, much like with Batman Begins, is to show you where the hero came from and who he was before he became so mythic.At least in BB, Bruce Wayne gets to be Batman. Here, such is not the case. Daniel Craig plays a real hard-ass killer, one who drinks, plays cards, and is both quick-witted and fast on his feet. He's a pretty cool guy  but make no mistake, he is not James Bond. Bond, even going back to Connery, is supposed to have a touch of the larger than life about him (though maybe not so much as Roger Moore gave him), and here, the filmmakers are strenuously determined that, outside of the action sequences, that not be so. Bond, as well as being a ruthless agent, is supposed to be a little suave, a little dashing (again, even going back to Connery); but Craig has (or was directed to have) none of that charm. He comes off as an intelligent, intuitive assassin, but not the super-spy that, frankly, most fans of the Bond series want to see.It doesn't help that he has no real villains to fight against. Le Chiffre (Mad Mikkelsen) is an international banker who launders black market funds, which isn't the same as a Chinese mastermind taking over an island in the Bahamas or a former Russian general stealing a laser satellite. Some people complained that these elaborate villains and schemes were what weakened the franchise, but look at an excellent barometer of what it is to be Bond, the Austin Powers movies. Mike Myers understands better than the Broccoli estate that what helps to make Bond Bond is pitting him against a worthy adversary. Granted, Le Chiffre is the villain in the novel as well, and in staying faithful to the book, they didn't have much choice but to use him. But even in the novel, when Bond beats Le Chiffre at baccarat (here dumbed down to poker), there is a sharp sense of relief and triumph. Here, when Bond wins, it's like a foregone conclusion, and the moment carries no impact at all.When Bond is running around trying to catch or kill someone, Royale is great. The extended pre-credits action sequence is really well done, but the problem is, it's pretty much the entire action for the whole movie. Again, this is merely following the book, but the filmmakers failed to realize that what passed for exotic in 1954 doesn't any more. Just having a sequence set in the Bahamas in the 1950s was exciting (still true of Dr. No in the early 60s). But with the shrunken world of the 21st century, we're not impressed with Carribbean locations or Montenegro's casinos. We've seen this all before.Royale is in and of itself an okay film. It's too long, and the twists and turns at the end are rather obvious (and they take waaaaaay too long to get to). The first hour and a half move along reasonably well, but the last 45 minutes drag. Craig is engaging enough as the lead, gruffer than Bond should be but ultimately he's an acceptable spy. The real problem with the film (aside from length) is the intent; the filmmakers try far too hard to remake Bond for a new century, when really, there was nothing wrong with the old Bond. By going back to the beginning of the saga, they were consciously trying to erase 40 years of cinematic history; a tall (and unwanted) order, and frankly, one that this movie is not up to. It's a little like the recent King Arthur movie with Clive Owen  not a bad movie at all, but not a particularly good representation of that iconic character. Sadly, since this film is doing well (the theater was the most crowded I have seen since Star Wars last summer), we'll be stuck not only with this actor but this version of Bond for the next few years. Here's hoping the next fella gets it right.",5,31,55,26 November 2006
Fantastic Four," Surprisingly well done
","Though they have managed to make some good Marvel movies, I'm still skeptical about a House of M film. For every X2, there's a Daredevil; for every Blade, a dopey Spiderman film (yes, I know most people think the Spiderman films are good. Most people are wrong). For years no one could do a superhero movie right, and Bryan Singer changed that. DC upped the stakes earlier this summer with the first good Batman film ever. But could the Fantastic Four  arguably some of the most comic-booky heroes ever created  be successfully translated? I doubted it.One of the problems with the FF in the comics is that the characters themselves are only moderately interesting, it's just that they have an amazing villains gallery (Galactus, all that negative zone crap, and of course the greatest villain in comics history, Dr. Doom). But the writers of the film were a step ahead of me; they realized that as well, and did their damnedest to make these people a whole lot more engaging than their comic counterparts. And largely, they succeeded.Having Reed (Ioan Gruffudd, perfect casting), the brainy scientist, be an ex of also somewhat brainy and impossibly sexy Sue (Jessica Alba) was a masterstroke that gives them a fun subtext right away and strips away the need for a lot of exposition. While both Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) and Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) are a little simplified, they are both handled effectively as well, from Ben's self-hatred (long a staple in the comic) to Johnny's immature handling of his powers. The four of them blend very well, and display more warmth and camaraderie than they ever do in print.The film's only weakness is in its villain, Victor Von Doom (still one of the greatest names Stan Lee or anyone else ever came up with  played here by Julian McMahon). Doom is less of his Darth Vader persona in the comics and is really more like Lex Luthor here, a wealthy industrialist slowly losing it while he, like the others, mutates. Doom is never captivating or interesting the way the leads are, which is an ironic twist as its exactly the opposite in the comics.The movie may be a little loud and a little dumb, but it's also fun and engaging. Johnny Storm's enjoyment of his powers and amused bewilderment at his new abilities jumps off the screen and infects the audience. Chiklis manages to give an excellent performance through a mountain of latex (even though, oddly enough, he looks like Sean Astin in that suit), portraying Ben's wounded side very well. Gruffudd plays Reed to a T  the ultimate dweeb, a science geek to end all science geeks but deep down a really good guy who just wants to help people. And Sue? Well, Sue Storm has always been the least well defined of the FF, and that's no different here. Alba is essentially eye candy, there for the fanboys to pant after, and in that regard she hits the mark perfectly. Sue is fine, there's nothing wrong, but she lacks any strong personality traits (and being sexy doesn't count). I would have liked to see her character developed a little more; she's pleasant but I felt there could have been more done.Even a relatively lackluster villain can't slow the proceedings down, and FF is surprisingly good. It's fast, it's funny, and it's very likable. I was very surprised by how well it was pulled off  far more engaging (and less stupid) than the Spiderman films. It doesn't take itself as seriously as Batman Begins, but I count that as a positive thing. It probably won't win over any non-comic book fans, but it's not trying to. FF is good summer fun, certainly worth a matinée.",7,3,6,11 July 2005
Sin City," Reprehensible piece of trash
","Sin City is a film geek's dream, all style and violence, an homage not only to the comics that spawned them but to Tarantino-esque gore and violence; it's even shot in black and white, features 'edgy' story material, anti-heroes, and gratuitous amounts of attractive female flesh. I'm sure the internet film geeks have already erected a shrine to this film. But unlike them, I have not come to praise Miller (or really Rodriguez), but to bury him.Rodriguez does, in fact, manage the near impossible feat of capturing Miller's noir style in an interesting way. I was worried that what worked for the comics wouldn't work for the movies, but Rodriguez pulls it off. Sin City looks like its graphic antecedents, and the sparse use of spot color echoes Miller's style and carries much of the same impact. While Miller's people rarely resemble real humans any more (except the always curvaceous women), I felt most of the casting was good too. Mickey Rourke is hidden behind a thick layer of prosthetics as one of the main characters, Marv, but it somehow actually works in the film. I think probably I liked Bruce Willis' Hartigan the best, but then I liked his story arc the most as well.The problem, sadly, is not with the visuals, where I thought it would be. The problem isn't even with the storytelling  although the narrative voices of the characters are so monotonous and so similar that you more or less lose track of who's doing what to who because they all speak with the same burned-out hard-ass gravelly self-deprecating voice. The problem is simply that the shorthand Miller used in the comics does not translate well to the screen, at all. Sin City on the page is a violent, dirty place, and it is so in the movie; but the insanely high level of sadism is far less shocking on the page than it is on the screen. Sin City plays like a two hour seminar in violence desensitization; every single imaginable physical cruelty  from eye-gouging to castration, from severed limbs to bullwhipping, to a lot, lot more  is played out in stark black and white. As if that weren't bad enough  and if you think it's not, you have bigger issues than I do, friend  what makes it even worse is that the film revels in the violence. In the comics, when these lunks go off to commit their mayhem, while they throw themselves into it, there's always an undertow of regret to it, of resignation, of knowing what they do damns them. But here, the committing of acts of unspeakable violence somehow seem to justify and redeem the characters; the more disgusting things you do in the name of revenge, the greater a hero you are. I cannot think of a single message more repugnant or reprehensible to send.To me Sin City, while perhaps an interesting visual exercise (though honestly I wasn't that captivated), is little more than an excuse to show blood and boobs for two hours. I could get the same thing with a little less style (and maybe Joan Severance instead of Jessica Alba) from a direct-to-video shlocker that at least knew it was a borderline snuff film and didn't have the pretensions to art. Sin City is two hours of repetitive, relentless sadism, wrapped up in an artsy package. With all that talent, with all the effort and work (and it's there), it's a shame they managed to miss the underlying message in all of Miller's comics  that the descent into this lifestyle can only end one way, and it's not good. The very heart, as it were, of Miller's message in the books, completely missing from the film. Rodriguez got all the trappings right, he just sort of missed the point. But so, then, did most of the fans.",1,140,249,3 April 2005
The Bourne Supremacy," Even better than the first one
","I gave 2002's Bourne Identity a pleasant but not glowing review, but I have to admit after several viewings on DVD that the first film grew on me. I've already seen the second one twice, but I had to see it a second time to review it as my first viewing was spent amongst rowdy and ill-behaved teenaged louts more interested in their potential rutting than the taut story unfolding before them on the screen.Matt Damon returns as the eponymous spy, now retired and trying to live his life in seclusion with his love Marie (Franka Potente). Unfortunately, a Russian hit man (Karl Urban) shows up from nowhere and disrupts that life, and the game, as in the first one, is afoot.I can't say much about the plot because there are a few wonderful twists in it that you absolutely wouldn't expect, and I don't want to give anything away. This movie fooled me incredibly on one plot twist, probably more completely than I have been fooled or misled in quite some time. But Supremacy is like that  just when you think you have it figured out, it turns around on you.I think this is actually a better film than the first one  tighter, leaner, and more suspenseful. Though Bourne is still plagued by amnesia, he's slightly more together and his newfound confidence and drive make him even more formidable. What also helps to elevate this movie is not just a better performance by Damon, but by sharp, strong turns across the board. Joan Allen is excellent as his semi-nemesis Pamela Landy; Allen gives us just the right combination of steel and level-headed planning, and she's a worthy foil for Bourne. Though her part is small, Julia Stiles is once again superb as Nikki, and Brian Cox  whom I'm really starting to like  is much more convincing and intriguing as Ward Abbott. Franka Potente, while not one of my favorites, nonetheless is able to once again imbue Marie with a warmth and humanity that makes it obvious why Bourne is drawn to her. And an actor whom I've liked for quite a while, Karl Urban, gives a great and creepy performance as the Russian Hit Man. Another actor I've long liked, Marton Csokas, has a small role as another Treadstone assassin, but he's wonderful.The action is blindingly fast and tight; fight scenes are like explosions of conflict. Bourne the character is crafty and subtle, and you can easily believe that he's giving the agency a run for its money. The chase scenes are all spectacularly well thought out, very clever and suspenseful. There are very few films, especially in the suspense genre, where the action takes a supporting role to character, but as well done as the action is here, that's exactly what it does. Director Paul Greengrass imbues the film with a great deal of well-used atmosphere. Landy's team's anxiety when Bourne kidnaps Nikki is palpable, leaping off the screen at you; Bourne's meeting with a fellow Treadstone agent is almost soothing, like the man himself, until things go south, and quickly; and the whole movie, set in winter, gives us a cold backdrop against the heat of the plot. The snow on the ground and the dead trees are subtle but effective reminders of Bourne's isolation, and the movie's mood helps propel the story as well.Damon here is a cut above. Not only does he perfectly portray Bourne's confusion, but he always manages to convey a sense of humanity through his almost super-human assassin. One scene toward the end, where Bourne makes a confession to a young woman, is simply excellent. But everyone is good here, sharp, quick, focused; the whole film is simply tight and well-balanced, well-played, and it moves so quickly it almost feels like it's over too soon despite being nearly two hours long.Bourne Supremacy is a very strong film, one of the best of the summer and the year. It fooled me more then once, which VERY few movies do, and it held my attention completely throughout twice  again, which very few movies do. There's an old saying about going to the well once too often, but I would not be unhappy to see another Bourne film. Though Jason develops in this movie, there are many places you could take this character, and I feel like we've really just started to scratch the surface. Don't wait until this is out for rental; see it in the theaters now, while you still can. It's certainly the most suspenseful movie of the summer, and one of the best crafted. They really don't get too much better than this.",9,3,4,7 August 2004
Shark Tale," Better than everyone is saying
","Don't get me wrong, I like Pixar; I like them a lot. But they are not the ONLY people who can do CGI films. I heard all of this crap several years ago when someone dared to make Antz, which people compared to A Bug's Life; but because Bug's Life was Pixar, everyone embraced its mediocrity (IMO it was Pixar's one significant misstep) and shunned Antz, which was on the whole a superior film. Not that I would argue that Shark Tale is better than Finding Nemo; personally I don't think they're aiming at the same thing, anyway. But just because it isn't Pixar doesn't mean it's bad; and if you disagree with that statement, then just stop reading right now, because you won't like anything else that follows.Shark Tale follows the adventures of one Oscar (Will Smith) who dreams of being a big fish in, okay, a big pond. His best friend Angie (Renee Zellweger) loves and supports him no matter who he is. Trouble is, he's into his boss Sykes (Martin Scorcese) for five thousand clams, and a get-rich-quick scheme explodes in his face. About to become food for the fishes, Oscar has the good luck to run into Lenny (Jack Black) a black-sheep shark who is hiding out from his father, Don Lino (Robert DeNiro). Together the two of them make unlikely allies as they try to help each other out.Shark Tale indulges in a lot of puns, but most of them work pretty well. The non-traditional animation style  the humanoid fish sort of vaguely resemble the actors playing their voices  works better than you'd expect; the likenesses are pretty good, and yet still manage to fit the characters and their personalities (though featuring Angelina Jolie as, well, an overtly sexy fish reminded me mostly of Troy McClure from the Simpsons). The humor isn't aimed at kids; while they will appreciate much of the movie's bright colors and the broader jokes, a lot of the verbal play and send-ups are based on spoofs of adult films. I think your average adult will get more out of the film than your average kid.The voice acting is a cut above; Smith is right at home, and Zellweger, whom I normally don't like, is excellent. DeNiro is fine, as you would expect, as is Jolie; but the movie is really stolen by Jack Black and Martin Scorcese. The director's blowfish is the funniest thing about the film, from his quick rejoinders to the way his voice goes all helium when he balloons up. And Black, whom I really do not care for, is simply excellent.I was also surprised by the decision to have the central character be gay. While they never come out and call Lenny gay, the entire movie he is struggling with who he is, how he doesn't fit in with his family, and how he just wants to be loved and accepted by his father; interestingly, he is accepted into an urban culture, and then masquerades as something he's not. Again, while no one ever actually says the word gay, the metaphor is inherently obvious, and I liked and respected the movie for going in that direction; teaching tolerance, even in a semi-treacly form, is usually a good thing.I found Shark Tale to be witty, clever, and well-designed; it goes a little overboard in a few spots, but by and large it was immensely entertaining and I laughed most of the way through the film. I found it clever and engaging and a wonderful way to spend an hour and a half at the movies. Whether or not you go is your own decision, but I think you could find far worse ways to spend your time and money than to see this movie.",8,1,2,4 October 2004
