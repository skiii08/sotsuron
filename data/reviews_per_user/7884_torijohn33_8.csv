Walk the Line," Johnny Cash
","My favorite scene from the movie was when him and June Carter had their first tour together, and you could see where the movie was going for there. I also liked how they showed their love for each other though music. Its telling Johnny Cash in his past and struggles they had to go though with being famous. Some people treated him poorly because he was addicted to drugs. They also didn't like June Carter because they feel that she was the reason they got divorced. I didn't know about much other then that they had a great music. No I have not seen other movies from this time period. There was nothing in this movie that made me question historical accuracy. No I have not seen other movies by this director. I feel like overall the main actors did a really good job. I liked in this movie how it showed his past and the struggles that he had to go through. I didn't like how everyone judged him and June Carter. I have seen this movie outside of school before so yes this is a movie I would watch outside of school.",8,2,2,8 February 2019
42," Jackie Robinson
",My favorite scene is towards the end when they kind of accept him into baseball. I really love the Dodgers. The filmmaker is telling us to keep pushing even when times get hard. The filmmaker is also telling us no to give up even when everyone is against you. I knew that they were going though a racial dispute. Yes I have because that's all we watch in your class. But I have seen this movie before. The lack of respect that people had towards him made me question historical accuracy. No I have not seen any movies by this director. One of the characters plays in Grey's Anatomy. Another one of my favorite scenes is when they won and went to nationals. Things I liked was it showed Robinson and his amazing years though baseball. I didn't like the racism in this movie. I would recommend this movie and I would watch it outside of school.,10,1,2,8 February 2019
Remember the Titans," The Titans
","This movie was a pretty good one, it was based shortly after the civil rights. The things that people wen through really showed through the movie and how they had to work together and get over the differences everyone has. my favorite part was when they made it work with the team and the history of the timeline really showed through as well as the team work. this movie overall was good but i wouldn't recommend to just anyone, i know that a lot of people might not enjoy this movie as well as others but still a good watch. I have seen some movies with Denzel Washington, he does pretty good and he fit the coach part really well. the things that people had to go through and segregation showed well through out the film based off the time line. and how the other players didn't want them to play but in the end they work together.",7,0,0,24 April 2019
Hidden Figures," Hidden Figures
","This movie was a really good one. My favorite scene is when they overcome the differences of everyone and the accomplishments that were made during this film. This movie is based on real people who were working for NASA and the struggles of their daily life. This part of history was going through controversy on equality and racism. I really enjoyed this movie and I think that if people want to see a really enjoyable movie with some history in it, this one would be a really good one to watch. I have seen this movie before out side of school and i really enjoyed it and would recommend this to friends and family. I also liked when they got their dream jobs at NASA because of the skill they had and how they took chances.",9,0,4,13 March 2019
Selma," Selma
","My favorite scene from the movie is the protest at the end of the movie, it was a successful one. The movie showed the struggles people had to live with and how innocent people would get murdered just because of the color of their skin. This point in time was traumatizing. These innocent people who were american where getting treated poorly because of one thing and its the color of their skin. They even killed white people for standing up with Dr.King. The movie has a great story line and showed what these people went through, some scenes were a little bit much and showed the police and citizens killing these people. I have seen a few movies with some of the women that play in this movie. I think the people they chose to play these parts did really good. I liked the History shown through the film. I didn't enjoy the people getting treated like the way they did and the killings. I have seen this movie outside of school. I would if they wanted to see this point/part of history and time. The movie was way good, it was sad to see how they were treated but it showed how they overcame these problems.",8,0,3,1 March 2019
Thirteen Days," twelve days
","One personal experience is my friend says shes distantly related to John F. Kennedy. One great scene would have to be the ending when they accomplish what they wanted, everything went well and they had a good claim against the USSR. The movie has a great set back and shows what they did to accomplish these things against the Soviet and doing it without a lot of errors. This part of history i feel has had a lot of world problems and everyone wanted to bomb places. This was the closest they got to a nuclear war, so it was a pretty intense time. The movie showed good history of the time and really let the audience have an intake on this time from the past. This time in history only makes me question, why does everything have to be solved by war and domination? To this day we have military out. I have not seen any other movies by this director besides this one. I´ve seen some other movies with the same actors in this movie but i´m not too sure. I liked how it really showed the struggles and how close they got to a nuclear war. Its not that i didnt like anything but im not a big fan of these types of movies. If any of my friends needed to learn about any of this then yes i would recommend this movie to them. This movie was pretty good and showed the true history of that time period",7,0,1,13 February 2019
Apollo 13," Apollo 13
",This movie was a pretty good one. I don't know what the real events were like but I can say that this movie showed the fear that the families of the crew. They were all terrified because of past fatalities and failures of the launches. My favorite scene is when they take off and have a successful take off. This movie truly shows the history part of time and how this was a huge event that the US was proud of. They weren't the first people in space but this was a good and successful flight. I have seen this movie outside of school and it was a pretty good movie but if some people aren't into this part of time then I wouldn't recommend but this did show the victory and the emotions that spread through the film of how they did this mission. Another good scene was when they showed us the cabin and how they did things with zero gravity.,8,0,1,14 March 2019
Back to the Future," A look in the past
",My favorite scene was when he gets stuck in the 1950's and his moms in love with him. I loved the pastel colors that they had. The filmmaker is telling you that they thought you could time travel and that there would be flying cars in the future. I also think the filmmaker is telling us that we dint want to be in high school with our parents. I already knew some of the music in this part of history and the cars they drove and the things they wore. Yes I have seen other movies in this part of history. Something that is similar is that we both have cars. Yes I have seen all of the back to the futures. I think that this is a good movie and I would watch movies with these actors before. I liked how it showed us the 1950's and the 1980's. I didn't like how the mom and the son had a weird relationship back in the 50's. Yes I would watch this movie outside of school because I have seen it before. I would recommend this to friends if they were into this type of film.,8,0,0,8 February 2019
