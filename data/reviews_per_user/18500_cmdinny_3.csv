Iron Man 3," Loved this from start to finish (mostly)
","Go see it. Don't listen to the comic book fanatics who rant and rave because it doesn't follow the comic books. I am an IM movie fanatic and this movie is worth the price of admission.I have had high expectations of this movie going into it, and I was not disappointed. I have read many of the negative reviews and I want to offset them. I am not a comic book fan and I don't know anything about them. I am an Iron Man/Tony Stark fan because of Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal, the witty writing, and the action. I can even stomach Gwyneth Paltrow for a couple of hours in this movie franchise. I admit, the ending wasn't what I expected, but it was appropriate. It will give viewers that Hollywood version of life.Spoiler!!!!!!!!!! Read on with mild spoilers.In real life, if your house blows up and slides into the sea...you don't come back from it. If you are a comic book/movie billionaire, you do. The 'Easter Egg' at the end was funny, but no SLJ or teaser for another movie. I was really rooting for Pepper to die, since I hat GP. Oh well. Maybe next time. I admit the comic book fanatics, having read their tirades, know more and care more about sticking to the comic book series, but this movie was awesome and seemed to me to have evolved the story line from adolescence to adulthood. Tony Stark needed to grow up and he did so admirably while retaining that Peter Pan quality we all love. Bottom line: go see it and enjoy it for what it is.",10,46,83,4 May 2013
The Expendables," Not worth $10.50
","Between the mumbling, ridiculously gross graphic violence, and the awful acting, this movie is not worth the price of admission. The characters were not well fleshed-out. We learned nothing about who they were, how they became a team, or anything. Jet Li started to share at one point, but that never amounted to anything. The only character we saw with any sort of a life was Jason Stratham, and even that was minimal, or depressing. The dialog was lame. Why does no one thinks that the audience would be grossed out by Mickey Rourke's drooling? I couldn't even watch his 'touching' scene where he explains why he is a tattoo artist now and not out killing people too. It started out OK, although a little gross. This movie is proof that Sylvester Stallone is beyond his prime. He is as hard to understand as he is to look at. Maybe a rental at best.",1,12,26,22 August 2010
Her," What a bad movie
","I heard such good things about this and saw all the good ratings from critics and viewers. I love sci fi. I love romance. I did not love this sci fi romance. Here is a guy who learns to open up again after a painful divorce. Awesome! We don't know nor can we judge what will help one person move forward in their life. This movie unfolded nicely with him slowly coming out of his shell and rejoining the living. Someday, we will probably have something similar to this. Smart technology will do amazing things. I can't believe this is Academy Award worthy. There were a few other movies out this year that were better and not nominated. Spoilers coming! * * * * * * I enjoyed this up until the part when everyone was OK with him calling his OS his 'girlfriend' and going on a double date. This ruined the movie for me. And what was the wacko date with Olivia Wilde? It got awkward really quickly. Which was funny and painful to watch. I loved the ex-wife's reaction to him dating his OS. I can relate.",3,1,3,25 January 2014
