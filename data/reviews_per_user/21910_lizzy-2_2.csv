"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Three drag queens trek across Australia in a bus they name Priscilla.
","I adore this film; it is one of my favorites. The ambience, the music, the characters, and definitely the accents drew me in. not to mention the fact that Guy Pearce (Felicia) is gorgeous. In his own way I think Hugo Weaving (mitzi) is also very attractive. the characters are certainly the best part of the film though. They are all so fun and quirky. I highly recommend this film to anyone.",10,3,5,11 July 1999
Evil Dead II," an incantation opens the gate to a parallel dimension, an evil dimension, and now the gate must be closed.
","This is a definite spoof on horror movies. It is also, in my opinion one of the single most hilarious movies ever created a definite must-see.",10,1,1,14 August 1998
