The Sound of Music," One of My Favorite Things
","This movie is one of my favorite things. The music, the family theme, the dynamics of the relationships between Captain Von Trapp as paterfamilias and Maria as governess with the children, and the Austrian scenery is absolutely gorgeous and makes me want to visit every time I see it. It becomes even better when you view the extras contained in the 40th anniversary DVD. This was the first movie I saw as a child and it has remained a favorite throughout the years. There were some misconceptions I held, as they were publicly promoted, about the relationship between the lead actors that they themselves debunk in the anniversary DVD. It makes viewing the movie that much more sweeter when you know they enjoyed making it.",10,3,10,29 December 2006
