Blade Runner 2049," Sometimes when you love someone very much, you have to be a stranger.
","Like replicators, we constantly look for or create people or things that are relevant to us and prove that we are special. Being needed and being loved are probably the two meanings of existence. One is the technology that is constantly being developed, the other is the warmth that is unwilling to give up, the coldness of technology and the temperature of human feelings. Human beings have been constantly extending and exploring these two poles, and the boundary between ice and fire is becoming more and more blurred. Perhaps this is what we yearn for future.",8,1,4,25 April 2020
Howl's Moving Castle," Hope must be seen in adversity.
","When Hal first flew in the sky with Sophie, the background music made me feel that Sophie had no way to forget Hal in her life. Hal turned out to be true, whether he was elegant, childish, brave, dark or warm. Hal lets me once again believe that the beauty of the world, I can not forget his blond hair when the gentle side face. Although it is not the best of Hayao Miyazaki's many works, it has created a dream for countless children, a moving castle. The film contains a large number of metaphorical symbols, the most important of which is the meaning of the castle, which symbolizes the heart of the door is not easy to enter. It is still clear at the end, Hal finally waited for the sweetheart.",9,1,1,27 March 2020
Your Name.," The most beautiful love.
","Even if forget your name, but still love you. Long and Sanye crossed the time and space to know each other and love each other. And the last encounter at the end of the film has not passed by, it is finally gratifying. Xinhaicheng will not give the standard ending of fairy tales, but it gives us room for reverie. The ending was perfect, and it was worth my while to see in the middle of the night!",9,1,1,22 March 2020
Kung Fu Panda," Wonderful and interesting
",I looked Po from the beginning and saw how he upgraded from an ordinary panda to a dragon warrior. Po was accidentally chosen by the tortoise and taught by master raccoon and the furious five. There are not many characters in this episode. Po's main opponent is dragon. The only way to defeat dragon is to be yourself. This is also the essence of the Dragon Cheats. The foundation of the Dragon Warrior was born. The village was saved and laid the foundation for Po to realize the Kung Fu dream.,9,1,1,11 April 2020
Fight Club," Psychological works, black humor
","You have to give up everything first. You have to have no fear and face the fact that you will die one day. You can't be free until you abandon everything. People are evil. Vulgar, disgusting, sex, violence, anger, assassination, arson, taboo, love. The last thing a person should suppress is an unfair, boring, dull mechanical life. Fighting is the most primitive and effective way to relieve stress.",9,1,1,1 April 2020
Memento," Once this movie gave me too much shock and association.
","I think the director's story is mysterious. On the contrary, it is some of the techniques and language of the film that make some stories interesting and beautiful. The flashback made me led by this story of solving the case. As the truth slowly emerged, I could not help but feel the paranoia and persistence of the male owner. Although there is no bloody violence, it will still be very worrying. Try to guess the real murderer again and again, and finally realize it. The note, the photo is useless, we will still choose to believe it.",10,0,0,6 May 2020
Captain Marvel," I love this movie very, very much
","There is no guidance and influence of the opposite sex in the whole process, and there is no love to let her have to show what is called 'female tenderness'. She is a female hero who has ideals, refuses to admit defeat, and is tough. I really appreciate this heroic, powerful, rebellious and uncompromising spirit, and I really like this version of Captain Marvel.The atmosphere is excellent, and the image of the female superhero is well established. Unlike the unrealistic beauty of Wonder Woman, the captain of the surprise gives a warrior's steel hard feeling, and the overall viewing effect is good! The scene of the first egg surprise captain rushing back to Earth, although not specially rendered, still feels so shocking!",9,2,6,25 April 2020
Zootopia," A good movie for everyone
","In terms of special effects, the picture of this movie is so beautiful, the bustling big city, the beautiful glaciers, the vibrant green forest, the train to the animal city, and the cute animals, which I could not think of in my childhood; This movie can truly reflect real life, dreams are great, but you need to face many difficulties in life, always maintain self-confidence, need to have a good partner, do not have colored eyes to see others, everyone has their own good side. Respect everyone. This movie is very good! Very worth seeing!",10,0,0,29 April 2020
Beauty and the Beast," Love conquers all
","The narrative theme of the film goes beyond the traditional love story in the classic fairy tale that the handsome prince and the beautiful princess fall in love, but the beauty refuses the tall and handsome suitor and falls in love with the fierce beast. It is powerful to convey a good theme of thought-the great power of a beautiful mind. In addition, 'Beauty and the Beast' does not just express the theme of love overcoming the curse. What I understand is more about the power of love, knowing how to love, not only the love of couple, but also the love of family, the love of friendship. This is a lot of Disney cartoon features such as music but also one of my most appreciated performance techniques. Many of the dialogue in the film are in the form of singing with beautiful music to express the characters with singing instead of simple conversation to express the ideas and feelings at that time. Solo, duet, chorus and other forms, all expressthe characters'thoughts and feelings, thus making the film more attractive and infectious.",9,0,0,17 April 2020
Madagascar," Hoping to do better
","It is not a new model for children's animation, and the film not only does not reach the height of the Ice Age, but also the story is not good enough. The affirmation of freedom is not something that children can understand. The control of friendship is only usual and it is difficult to find an impressive place. But this is a 'fairy country' created for children, as long as they don't mind. Why should we struggle?",7,1,1,7 April 2020
Ice Age: The Meltdown," A little disappointed
","Technically, it is a lot higher than the first one. Whether it is texture or hair, the water wave effect is far ahead of the previous one. But where's the punch line? Those two possums are annoying. Some of the plot exaggerated, there are some animals inexplicably disappeared bug, but there are turtles were eaten only a shell of this serious juvenile inappropriate plot in. It's disappointing. Only the squirrel is still cute.",6,1,1,6 April 2020
Spider-Man 2," The greater the ability, the greater the responsibility.
","I really like this version of Spider-Man. Like ordinary people, he has a lot of troubles in life. He is also very fragile and wants to give up, but he finally defeats myself. I feel that he is an ordinary hero who really exists in the world. I will not forget the scene that everyone lifts him.As a superhero, the little spider has no money to pay the rent and has no money to redeem the house. The super power is gradually lost. He also wants to take pictures of his life's love engagement. He throws the tights away like ordinary people and chooses to retreat, but turns to save little girl in the fire. Maybe that's why I like spider-man. And Dr. Octopus deliberately exposed full of fat must be a joke.",8,2,2,28 March 2020
Finding Nemo," One of the most classic cartoons.
","At that time, I felt so moved. When I watched this film, a self-blaming clown fish father experienced many difficulties crossing the ocean to find his own children, and Little Nemo gradually grew up on the road of wandering and realized the meaning of love and life. And the confused but kind Dolly, a group of fish tanks working together to help Nemo's wonderful sea creatures.",9,1,1,29 March 2020
Aquaman," Beautiful sea world.
","Aquaman, a very creative science fiction film in the second half of 18 years, although the film related to the underwater world is insufficient , but its world view deserves our consideration. Who is the master of land and sea, we come from the ocean. We are ruling the world, strictly speaking, only the land, there may be part of the ocean surface. Ecology, we can not help but talk about a topic, life depends on the ocean over land, on the ocean, we should be what attitude.",7,0,4,23 March 2020
My Neighbor Totoro," Childhood is the most beautiful
","The film portrays the two sisters as full and realistic.At the same time, when encountering unknown things, children's curiosity is always greater than fear. They have a pure heart and a lovely character . The film interprets this very well, let us seem to return to childhood again.Chinchillas don't appear many times in this movie.But the audience will love it because it's really simple and cute. But the film not only has illusory imagination, but also shows the quietness and warmth of the real world. The real patron saint is not the imaginary chinchillas, but everyone around them.",10,1,1,19 March 2020
Deadpool 2," Like the bad-mouthed but beautiful-hearted hero
","The first half was a bit boring, and the second half of the action was fierce and laughter-intensive. Many of the lines mentioned Disney and Marvel characters and the stalk of Fox, which is quite interesting.I visited the old man in the end and saw my tears. In the future, you may never see the old man appear in the Marvel movie again, and the old man has gone all the way. Thank you for creating so many great characters for fans all over the world who love the Premier League. Have a good journey.",9,1,1,14 May 2020
Spider-Man 3," The spider-man I grew up with
","Completely Toby Maguire's super acting, the perfect switch between Spider-Man and the venomous black Spider-Man attracted me . The little green devil's last behavior for the best friends and brothers to stand up and take the righteousness is really moving. Each of the Spider-Man trilogy has a theme: the first is confusion and choice; the second is escape and commitment; the third is pride and introspection. In this film, spider-man not only has to face three powerful enemies, but also face up to his demons. It is easy to indulge yourself. It is not easy to strengthen your conscience at all times and not to do things that hurt others. And 'even Spider-Man needs help' .",8,0,0,27 March 2020
Thor: Ragnarok," The best one in the Thor series
","Good-looking, better than the first two. The scene is spectacular and the visual effect is gorgeous. There is no lack of humor between the characters. Hulk is cuter, but also a little proud. Locky is also good and evil, still very attractive. Hella interprets what is called the Queen's gas field. Hammer brother has no highlights and is slightly boring in the previous Marvel movies. In this department, the charm is infinite, the humor is funny, and the characters are completed. Transformation. Is that the final war with Hella was a little hasty.",9,2,5,28 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The man who brought his own BGM is really handsome
","The 1. plot is similar to the fourth, but adds fresh and interesting elements such as the Ewoks. The contents of the three lines of the 2. Endor campaign are relatively balanced. The flaws in the 3. Death Star II, Palpatine's death, and so on are all obvious, bug. 4.

Tangled," One of my favorite movies in the Disney princess series
","Princess Rapunzel's long blond hair satisfies all teenage fantasies. When watching a movie, the first thing that sprouted was such a long hair-smooth and supple, golden, woven twist, life-saving healing, swinging, hitting bad guys, long hair that can be used for martial arts.Every girl does love it.Princess Rapunzel does not know the world at first, then to beexcited and entangled, to be confused, to be firmed; Eugene use Rapunzel in the beginning, then he likes her. This step-by-step change in the relationship and psychological process is the most attractive and most desirable. The section that lights the sky lantern is classic, I have to say. The residents of the city spontaneously prayed for the little princess who had been missing for many years. With the palace as the center, the sky lanterns of the people around them slowly lit up and lifted off. At this time, Rapunzel and Eugene were on the boat in the distant river, watching the sky lanterns of the imperial city lift off a little. Drifting across the river, filling the night sky, dreamlike, moving-both for the beauty of the sky lantern, but also for Rapunzel to achieve their wishes for many years and moved.",9,1,1,2 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," There's nothing the force can't solve. If there is, do it again
","The two-hour movie, the climax is actually several waves, the most burning is the final Sith and Jedi confrontation. The two men kneeling in front of Palpatine, once Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader, were replaced this time by Rey and Ben. Two hours of movies, there are many scenes of action, in fact, you can have more inner struggles, otherwise there will be some small delays. However, such a paving pattern can be seen from the first part of the new trilogy. I still like the new trilogy very much. I like this girl named Rey and Ben who can finally turn back. I'm not a super star wars fan, but I love this trilogy. May the force be with you all.",8,7,32,25 April 2020
"Monsters, Inc."," Disney really knows how to use cartoons to conquer audiences of all ages.
","< Monsters.Inc > A very imaginative classic cartoon film, the image of various monsters is very creative, the fluffy hair of the hairy monster is too real, and the character is particularly loyal and cute. If humans and monsters can live in peace, it is also a very beautiful world.Even if the monster is the main character, it still achieves the goal that beauty is greater than ugliness. Even the villain does not feel his sense of danger. And inside, in the compact 90 minutes, there is an endless stream of jokes, especially the one-eyed dragon's words are really too much. The overall setting of the film is very closely related to children without losing the sense of science fiction. It is also a very good idea to use the screams of scared children to generate electricity. At the end, laughing instead of crying made the film's style rise again. Of course, that 'arbitrary door' war is also the most exciting part of the film.",9,1,2,27 March 2020
Captain America: The First Avenger," Forever Captain

The whole world remembers the little girl, but the first protagonist in my heart is Leon. He seems to be a very good person to live such as regular work and rest, normal diet. In addition to his job as a professional killer, he irons his clothes one by one and carefully wipes the dust off the leaves for the green plants.

Justice League," It's really a satisfying superhero movie.
","At the beginning, although I knew that superman would come back, I could not help imagining the world without him. It was terrible. The legends of the heroic age inspire the heroes of the new age!

Kung Fu Panda 2," Chinese elements are really good to use
","Paper-cut shadows, ink folk music and various Chinese cultural elements are brilliantly integrated to tell: no matter how much pain in life and the past, we must grasp the present and strive for the future.

As a result, everyone confirmed his destiny, so the foundation of everything is based on ' destiny by heaven '?",9,0,0,23 April 2020
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Surprisingly good-looking, worthy of praise
","I didn't think about how good it looked, but it turned out to be cool. Regardless of the style of painting, music and people, the theory of parallel worlds was seen in the past, and the film portrayed it as cool and great! There are always things in life that are not satisfactory, and there are many that have no choice. Then, we accept, change, move forward, and keep faith! Wish we all be heroes in our own lives, have our own beliefs, and be defeated and always get up.",10,0,1,4 May 2020
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," The comedy effect is too bad, the plot is slightly inexplicable
","Compared to the first part, it is more spoof and more absurd, for children, they get less than a joke, and not fun for big friends. However, the victory in the lines is ingenious, and the speed of the voice actor's own rhythm is funny and the overall entertainment still holds up a certain level. It can be seen that I want to express the ordinary and unique nature of human beings conquering nature and destroying ecology, but they are all robbed by cross-species love and natural extraordinary lion dance! Therefore, there are too many characters, and too many themes will inevitably lose sight of each other and cannot be balanced.",7,1,1,7 April 2020
Dangal," A critical and hopeful film.
","In portraying the image of oppressed women, this film took a different approach and selected two female wrestlers. For Gita and Babita, this is their only way out, but for more Indian women, their lives have been arranged early. It is also in such a social environment that the gold medal won by Gita at the end of the movie is so precious and so bloody. What impressed me most was that the father was locked in the dark room, I prayed silently not to let him out. I don't want to see actress regains the courage to defeat her opponent because of her father's arrival. Such an ending would make the film mediocre. Good thing is that the director didn't let me down. Her ability came from her father, but in the end she learned to fly alone.",9,0,0,19 March 2020

The Amazing Spider-Man," Lack of innovation
","Spider-Man is also a human being. This Spider-Man has weakened the hero's personal attributes, especially when the cranes are all turned around for him. I think it is the most moving. time. I personally feel that it is not bad. Actress Emma Stone has a sad beauty when she smiles. The story is very warm and slow-moving. But it is a bit old-fashioned in the villain setting and lacks the necessary motivation. It does not inject new performance and kernel.",7,2,3,9 April 2020
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," The magic world is fun. Just be happy.

Yesterday," A little disappointed, but recommend it
","I don't think it's a funny movie, I'd rather accept it as a tribute to The Beatles. I remember when the Bohemian Rhapsody hit, some fans said that they hope to pay tribute to these great bands, of course, can not all use the replica mode, this way is very good. Tears welled up in our eyes as we sang hey jude together at the end of the film.Full of Beatles music filled the film, many tribute bridges, fun settings are remarkable. However, the development of the plot always gives people a feeling of lack of anything, lack of logical coherence, lack of explosive points in music interweaving, and the end is too relaxed. What is particularly true about the plot is that the male just started the nameless stage in the bar and even if he sang Beatles music, no one cares, true and impressive. However, the Beatles'music is quite powerful on the big screen, or it is recommended to take a look.",8,0,0,27 April 2020
Avengers: Endgame," The perfect ending
","The final battle, you really can not imagine the joy. The audience has been screaming all the time, and the scene I am looking forward to is really boiling when it appears on the screen. Three hours. I thought it was long, but it was short. As the last part of this stage, let us see the flesh-and-blood superheroes, not the rich and handsome men wearing expensive armor or the gods with their own lightning, The time machine not only takes them to find the original stone, but more importantly Let them marry. Let Marvel powder see that the original superhero is also emotional, just like watching the wolf uncle late. Humans create superheroes to satisfy their fantasies, but in the end they have not forgotten that fantasy is a fantasy life (a life without superheroes)!",9,1,7,24 April 2020

","In the process of returning to the past time nodes to change the future, the heroes also stringed up a previous Marvel series of movies, so that many things have a complete account, but also make the characters more three-dimensional full. When the Captain picked up the Thor hammer, there was a small climax in the theater; when the little spider-man came back, it was also a small climax. The Captain ridiculed their American hips, and when he were attached to the person who wanted to catch him in the elevator and said 'Hooray for Hydra ', people who understand were happy. The magnificent fighting scene looks super cool on the big screen of the cinema. In the end, Iron Man's self-sacrifice is really embarrassing. I love you 3000 times, too.",9,1,3,25 March 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," I don't know how to describe it
","It took two hours to go back to Hollywood half a century ago and bury a bunch of mines. In the last 20 minutes, it was detonated with a not-so-new creative chain, but the effect was very good. Surprise to the explosion, perhaps the best for Sharon Tate. The way to pay homage. Sure enough, it is the least spoilers of the year.This is the gentlest movie to Hollywood and the most vicious movie to Bruce Lee. Quentin used a movie to round out the California dream of all Hollywood filmmakers, but woven a vicious spider web in the hearts of Chinese fans. Although there is anger and dissatisfaction, I still respect the film and hope that Quentin can maintain the respect he deserves for Bruce Lee.",7,0,3,25 April 2020

","This animated film 13 years ago made me surprised at the time, because its theme is novel. Superman becomes a family, no longer every lonely individual, every member of the family has a good strength, but still cooperate with each other and protect each other.Looking at the helplessness of Mr. Super in the face of work, facing the family and even facing himself, it is simply to see us.

","So long after the heat wave passed. I finally saw the film. It's so beautiful. Watching yourself falling in love is sometimes a cruel beauty. Although you are mentally prepared and have calculated the worst results countless times, when everything really happens, you can't help feeling sad. It is a love story that took place in a small Italian town in the 1980 s. And the feelings between them and finally beyond love, has become a beautiful existence, an emotional sublimation and growth of the mark. Dad ' s words at the end were very heart-warming.

The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Visual effects are good, the plot is not good
","I think this is a choice between small love and big love. Spider-Man's existence as a savior is his responsibility to put on 'clothes', but he is only an ordinary person who takes off 'clothes'. He has the most ordinary feelings. The beautiful special effects scene has once again improved. In addition to the Gwen 's death, the storyline has not become the inherent ending of the American hero movie.

Coco," Death is not death, but being forgotten.
","One of the reasons for the success of the film is that it talks about the topic of 'death' that people all over the world will experience. We are all full of fear of death, fear of loss, fear of the unknown nature.The film was a great comfort to the audience.Death is not death, but being forgotten.This film is not sad, not forced tears, but humorous pictures, bright development rhythm slowly implant stories and emotions into your perception, all the details lay the foundation for the results, so at the end of the emotional point, The warmth and restraint of the treatment, the audience watching began to worry about the next development. Until remember me rings, I can't help crying.",10,1,1,24 March 2020
1917," Human reflection
","The whole film has a degree of relaxation. The war scorched earth of the broken wall, the deafening artillery fire, and the quiet and beautiful European fertile soil,all the scenes were great. I have to say that Roger Dickins, the 'innocent king' of Hollywood photographers, gave this film a sense of high-level aesthetics, and even shot the ugly battlefield of World War I with a beauty which we have never seen before. Of course, this film essentially expresses 'anti-war' . This 1917 tells everyone that war is terrible through the stench of two soldiers, the French women and newborn babies who are lingering in the basement.The film tells everyone that war is terrible and peace is important.",10,2,3,17 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The power of justice seems small, but it is huge
","It looks better than expected, the plot is rich, and there are many reversals. Compared with the previous one, it is a qualitative leap. This one, whether for decent or villain, is reshuffled, the end of the older generation, the maturity of the new generation. Especially the son of Han Solo. Sweeping the decline of a literary youth, it has finally become a charming villain. Light and darkness coexist, belly black, and changeable. Of course, it would be more perfect if you could send less fire.",9,2,9,15 May 2020
Brave," A little disappointed
","I like the red hair of Marida's curly volume, just like the burning flame, but I can't understand why it is called 'brave'. Everything has to pay the price, bear it, enjoy it.Just as interesting as Pixar's previous animations, but the story itself has little to do with 'brave.'. The theme of mother-daughter love is dissected too straightforwardly and insipidly. The Scottish style is depicted, and the soundtrack and episodes are also well suited to the atmosphere. In addition, it is really cute after becoming a bear.",7,0,0,31 March 2020
Shrek 2," True love doesn't care what you look like
","The beginning is to meet the father-in-law, the climax is the fuse of the spy in the dish was detonated, the ending is the fairy tale character's party. If you like someone, do you have to make a change for them? Shrek and Fiona tell us that if the other person likes you, then the other person likes you just the way you are. In addition to the doctrine of love, this film joined the cute boot cat. I think it is better than the first one, and I look forward to more exciting later.",8,1,1,5 April 2020
The Dark Knight," This movie can see the deep level.
","The biggest villain in the movie-the clown is undoubtedly the most attractive character in the whole movie. The clown's own contradictory behavior and the madness of crime make this character a classic that can never be surpassed. In the movie, the clown's many unusual behaviors and strange movements, such as unnatural licking of lips and rolling eyes, make this character become classic. The excitement of his childhood made him appear in front of the audience as a psychopath. And his name makes him even more bizarre. The clown's belief is to uncover all the human's cover-up, to prove the selfishness, greed and crueltyof human nature.He ever said 'Now I see the funny side, now I always smiling.'",10,0,1,25 March 2020
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Good and evil always exist, but we can choose who to grow up.
","The one where sirius leaves, and gradually the people we like leave us one by one. Harry becomes incredibly lonely and weird in this one, but then the power of love and friendship overcomes everything. The order of the Phoenix is a drama in which interpersonal relationships have changed dramatically in eight films, in this film, Potter was questioned by so many people for the first time, even when his classmates at the same college did not want to believe him. He and Hermin, Ron still works side by side, even helping students who don't believe in him or even hate him to learn magic. These have made me see the rapid growth of a 14-year-old boy that is the most profound plot for me. But the shortcomings of the film are also obvious. The plot is too rushed so that a lot of places don't shoot well enough.",7,0,0,18 April 2020
Toy Story," Friendship between toys.
","I remember when I was a child, I didn't dare to open the toy after reading it for a while, for fear that they suddenly jumped out and said: 'I am woody. ' What is even more amazing today is the amazing imagination, creativity of the animators at that time, and the excellent special effects technology in 1995. The script is quite neat, especially the small climax of Woody's rescue of Buzz. It is very exciting, and the character is also very good. The focus is on the character change of Woody and Buzz. Woody eliminated the embarrassment, Buzz found his own existence value, and the details echoed perfectly, and the overall is quite good.",10,1,1,3 April 2020
Avatar," Always remember the shock of watching it for the first time
",The film shows a near-perfect planet in the beauty of Pandora. The colorful plants are vivid and the huge waterfalls flow down. It is a very famous visual feast. The applause after watching the film is really a bit touched. It belongs to the most classic in the movie. I hope that the second part will be broken soon.,10,0,0,27 April 2020
Toy Story 2," It's not as good as the first one
","The second part takes on the style of the first part, and the theme is somewhat scattered. It is a choice between discussing whether the fate of the toy is reserved for everyone to exhibit or limited to the play of a child. The only thing that touches people in the film is that Tracy recalls a scene in which she was abandoned, and Woody ' s process of choosing loyalty is quite awkward. Even if he chooses his own master, he still cannot solve the contradiction that the core is abandoned. In short, the second part incorporates a lot of movie bridges of the year, but it is not clear when dealing with the core theme.",7,1,2,5 April 2020
3 Idiots," Creation is always important.
","When I first saw the name of the movie, I don't think it is a good film superficially.But when I actually went to see the film, I found I was wrong.Its name is both appropriate and ironic.I like the hero too much.He is the brightest star in the film.At the same time, his friend is also very cute.Even the principal is cute.Every character in it is so distinct.In the end, I learned a lot in this movie, especially to be an independent thinker.",10,2,2,14 March 2020
Up," A warm movie
","This was overall just an excellent movie. There is nothing negative that I have to say about this movie so I will just jump into a few of the things that I really liked about it. First, Doug and Kevin where so charming. Well, to be frank the entire movie is amazing charming in its own way, but Doug and Kevin especially. The movements of the bird are just amazing, and the things that the dogs say and do are exactly what you would expect a dog to do, they captured it perfectly. They were quirky and funny and lovable all at the same time, something that the guys over at Pixar are really good at.The beginning of the movie was a bit more dark than I was expecting it be, but it set up the rest of the story so well. I felt like this was an animated movie, but really had a lot of meaning to just about anyone who watched it. There were some really hard-hitting moments, most in the early part of the movie, that really got the viewer emotionally attached to the characters.",10,1,1,26 March 2020
How to Train Your Dragon," I want to keep one like this, too
","The boy is the first Viking who does not kill the dragon, but he is the only Viking who can ride the dragon. At the same time, he admires the perseverance of the male owner after breaking the leg. It is wonderful to dance with the dragon.The picture is amazing, the toothless and pleasing shape is very handsome, and the feeling of flying is too enjoyable.

Pulp Fiction," Beloved in black humor.
","The bodyguards who read the Bible before shooting, the boxers who killed people with samurai swords, the homosexuals who raised slaves, the elegant old butlers. When all the cool elements were complete, the director used them to talk about a lot of trials. It is also a thrilling story. It makes people applaud.Ingenious structure, wonderful lines, and the mapping of the circular structure to reality, Quentin is really a genius , playing so much in a movie, and can also produce a unique style of violence .",10,2,3,30 March 2020

Harry Potter grabbed the Goblet of Fire with the help of Sirius and friends.And he was transmitted to the land of Voldemort's rebirth. Diggory was killed. At the crucial moment, Harry Potter's parents used magic to save Harry Potter, and gradually raised the confrontation between Harry Potter and Voldemort. This one is a turning point, starting with Cedric's death and Voldemort's return, which means that the Harry Potter series is no longer a teen movie, but is slowly turning into an adult-oriented adventure movie, and the war is paved the way.",8,1,1,29 March 2020
Castle in the Sky," If here were a sky city in the world.
","Watercolor-like transparent picture, pure and simple children, unrestrained imagination. Hayao Miyazaki brings us not only the beauty of the picture, but actually more of the thinking behind those light watercolor pictures. Human beings from primitive society, experience industrial society, to the future society and then return to the earth. The author may have thought deeply about the future of mankind. At the same time, it also shows opposition to war and longing for nature.",9,1,1,1 April 2020
The Shape of Water," Dark fairy tale
","Regardless of the lens language or lighting, the whole film is full of retro 80s movie style, especially the description of the villain, making such a dark story with depression temperament into an adult fairy tale.I really like the atmosphere of the movie, the nostalgic and elegant taste, especially the actress uses the mop and bucket as props in the laboratory, still dancing. She is not the amazing beauty, but has a natural temperament. I like the red and green spot very much. Before she did not fall in love, she wore green. After falling in love, it was red shoes and red headscarf. I like this point very much, the taste of love from the inside out.",9,1,10,30 March 2020

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," My favorite one
","Compared to the amazing of the previous one, what impressed me most in the second Harry Potter was the friendship between Harry, Ron and Hermione, especially when Harry was at the petrochemical Hermione window.When Harry Potter said to Hagrid that Hogwarts can not do without you, that moment moved me.The whole process was super excited. Ron and the twins drove Harry out of the car, full of magic but small but warm 'dwelling', Dobby controls the walking ball, the living professor wearing a waist black robe holding a wand and Lockhart 'duel'. Diary of a young man, Harry fighting a basilisk.I can't help but want to cry when I see these above. This is our magical world, welcome home.",10,1,1,21 March 2020
Ice Age," I watched many times when I was a kid, and now it's a classic.
","I especially liked it when I first watched it more than a decade ago. It was my favorite cartoon in my childhood. After many years, I relived the classics. Even though I have seen many excellent animated films, although human beings have been painted ugly and not cute at all, I still feel that this cartoon is particularly good, and the interesting character, the exquisite picture are touching people's feelings. The most important is that ordinary lens can make me smile,.It is a very warm cartoon.",9,2,2,6 April 2020
Ice Age: Continental Drift," A good medicine to relax your mood
","After reading 1-4 of the Ice Age in one breath, these special animal models are shaped to be cute and energetic, and the warmth and adventure of the family are perfectly combined. The most worth mentioning is the invincible hapless squirrel.The power of the squirrel is really endless, 'making' a brand new earth. This invincible cartoon that combines family, love and friendship still brings a lot of joy ~ ~ The 3D effect of cartoons is generally much better than that of real people.",7,2,2,12 April 2020
WALL·E," One of the greatest achievements in cinematic history
","The animation is flawless. Absolutely flawless. Especially on earth and the robots. It looks real. Much of the time it's impossible to tell whether or not it is real. The few slightly-shaky styled shots that appear a few times in the film only makes the animation
that much more amazing and realistic. The humans are really good, too, while not realistic in the sense of you seeing it right now in real life, but they do have a realistic feel to them. The thing with the humans, I believe, is that they were purposefully meant to have this slightly rounded, slightly unrealistic feeling.",10,1,1,24 March 2020
Parasite," What does money stand for
","Poverty and prosperity, hope and despair, this is a story that profoundly reflects the bottom of society, absurd but realistic, human beings struggle in despair and look for beauty in hope. A liar family mixed into the upper class for making a living, step by step shocking. Borrowed space, deceived wine were all temporary. The rich surface is glamorous, behind the drug, the children are rebellious and morbid, and the poor put down the patience and expose the hypocrisy of the face. Who's not a parasite? The human heart is complex, human nature is difficult to ponder, I hope that fantasy becomes a reality.",9,1,2,23 March 2020
Despicable Me," Warm and cured.
","The glory of 'Despicable Me' should not be attributed only to the Little Yellow Man. Perhaps even the world itself did not expect it to be so popular in the world. Compared with the cute things, the story is more attractive. The seemingly super bad guy Gru is lonely inside. Everyone will be selfish, but there is no doubt that human nature must be good. It was very touching. It was a generation of thieves, but it was turned into a daddy by a few little girls. A movie with tears ended like this.",8,0,1,19 April 2020
Shrek," An old fairy tale for innovation.
","More beautiful than all vulgar fairy tales, because this time the theme is love, or ugly monsters and beautiful princesses, and later ugly princesses and ugly monsters. With love, looks don't matter. In other words, putting the theme of the adult world into the animation, but it has not yet been deeply explored, but it also makes the story full.

","Silence of the Lambs attempts to expose the basis of modern American crime through film, in which the prisoner, both a psychopath and a master of mental research, has been looking for reasons to kill himself. to release himself.After watching 'The Silence of the Lambs', the most unforgettable is the eyes that shine with all kinds of light, without language confession, they express the inner heart of the character in a more profound way, and this expression is with the audience. More suspense and horror. It is also more impressive in the hearts of the audience.",10,1,1,4 April 2020
The Dark Knight Rises," The greatest hero movie
","I have to say it was a shock to watch Batman in IMAX Hall. On the one hand, this kind of shock comes from the almost perfect audio-visual experience of the IMAX hall, and more importantly, Nolan's precise control of the plot and the picture, cleverly combines the commercial film and the art film, and the commercial atmosphere is too rich. Less than one point, the artistic display is not in place. Exquisite acting, wonderful battle footage, excellent CG synthesis, perfect picture control, presents a near-perfect audio-visual feast.More than 2 hours, it is really wonderful. Now those one-and-a-half-hour movies are too short. The plot limits the whole story to reversal, feelings, passion, you can be selfish, but please do not to blame others. Grateful tribute to those who give in silence",10,2,3,14 April 2020
Monsters University," A story of diligence and talent
","Looking at it, I was inexplicably moved. One was to remind me of my childhood; the other was to be suddenly moved by the friendship between Big Eyes and Sullivan. This film tells us to explore their own advantages, adhere to the dream; also tells us to be aware of their position in the team, to find a suitable position in order to really play an important role. Since the big-eyed boy so cute image, not suitable for doing scarer, there is no need to adhere to, he can also do the team's 'mind', planner.

Toy Story 3," Say goodbye to a reluctant childhood.
","Disney is the only one who can make these toys so vivid. I originally thought that the villain in the toy had experienced this life and death and would eventually be influenced. It seems that there is no. Just like in reality, there are also people who not only see death and not save, but still throw stones. It's probably the greatest mercy to hang it on the front of the car and mark it! And the, 'Take care, man. ' It is also the most affectionate farewell of the cowboy Woody to Andy. I like the last scene of the whole film.This inevitable ending is perfect, let the toys continue their mission, accompany another child who loves them to grow up, and it is suitable to end here. Woody watched Andy ' s car go away and cried.",9,1,1,28 March 2020

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," An epic movie
","The film scene is magnificent and the special effects are realistic. The film shows the spectacular of the audience in Middle-earth. Each character has his role. The plot is divided into two main lines: the Aragon group participating in the war and the Frodo group destroying the Lord of the Rings. The plot is not muddy. It has changed the novel, but it has changed very well, because in many places in the novel, I think their rhythm is a bit slow. Staying in one place will stay for a few days, and the feeling of the movie is that the time is compact, the pace is accelerated, and the audience can feel nervous. Every time I saw the war and people rushed forward for freedom and justice, I was moved and really shocked.",10,2,2,24 March 2020
The Matrix," A cross-century film
","Every time I watch this movie, I am amazed at the innovation of the plot core, especially when I found out that this is a movie in 1999. It is really a good movie across the century. Keanu Reeves's face stayed in a classic movie, and stayed in the hearts of many people. The machine world and the human world, the two worlds are connected and fighting each other. And the final sacrifice of Neo is in exchange for temporary coexistence. This shocked me. What shocked me the most was that human beings had failed so many times, and it was very shocking my old idea that I thought human beings are the most advanced and intelligent cognition at that time.",10,1,1,18 March 2020
Deadpool," Juggling fights, dark humor, excitement, violent blood, love.

","Racism, homosexuality, two sensitive topics, through the small object of the Green Paper, can already imagine the hardships of the discriminated people, and then see those who think they are above, the film has been more than half successful. The funny footage of the doctor and the driver getting along with each other makes the movie less depressing. The whole feeling is that it wants you to feel the silence into your perception, but not so depressed. A warm film full of conflicts, but the rhythm of the whole film is just right. One black and one white, elegant and vulgar, two people who are incompatible with each other from opposition to mutual support, complete self-salvation. The world is cruel, but the first step is no longer to face with loneliness, you will find that the scenery along the way is really beautiful.",9,1,1,10 April 2020

","This is a story about passion, change, friendship and challenge. To be honest, the style of Madagascar is quite different, but it is this kind of difference that makes people sincerely admire after laughing. Whether it was the circus or the final rescue, it was a collective outbreak of imagination, scripts and visual effects. The first half of the European war was also excellent and interesting.
