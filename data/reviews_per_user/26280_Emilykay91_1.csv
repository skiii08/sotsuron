The Avengers," Long, but great.
","The Avengers is a great action movie people of all ages would enjoy, especially geeks and fans of comics. Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, and others are all in it! The movie is action-packed, with amazing special effects, but with the traditional storyline one would expect from similar films. However, it is not the storyline that defines this movie, but the rich interactions of all these superhero characters as they try to work together to save the world.The Avengers is entertaining, with many funny moments, one-liners, unexpected events, and even long fights between the superheroes themselves. However, the movie progresses very slowly, which is a bit frustrating for a movie packed with superstars and a run time of two hours and 23 minutes. Although I appreciate the director's work in taking enough time to present the unique and complex personality of every character in the story. The cast also does a great job with the characters, and each of the superheroes gets their own chance to shine throughout the story, although you can see the director's unique passion towards the Iron Man and Hulk characters -- Joss Whedon wrote the screenplay and directed the film.In short, the movie is long, but great! And if you like Marvel's superheroes, this is definitely THE movie for you!",10,2,7,20 October 2013
