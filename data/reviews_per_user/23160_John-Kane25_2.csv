The King's Speech," Wow! Every range of emotion is here. Anyone who is not perfect must watch this.
",Everyone who is not perfect will relate to this movie. Colin Firth gets the cadence of King George VI's pre-war speech down pat. The movie features the strong relationship between King George VI and his speech therapist. The king meeting a commoner in his home as an equal is priceless. The journey along the way is full of personal challenges. The lesson here is overcoming an individual's greatest weakness. Having the courage and perseverance to come through at the most important time.While there are no action scenes the wide range of emotional drama is the action and keeps the viewer invested in the outcome. A rare masterpiece in film. All the more so because it is based on a true story with the backdrop of the start of WWII.,10,0,0,14 April 2018
Fury," More like a video game than a movie
","A product of the video game culture I think. If you want non-stop action, its here. However this movie is masquerading as a wwII flick. Much of the movie is from inside or just outside a Sherman tank. This makes about 1/5th of the movie claustrophobic, not unlike a submarine movie. Its this intimacy of a close knit group of men that is the strongest suit of the movie.The movie seems to try to explain how innocent young men become ruthless killers. With a couple of the American characters portrayed as complete animals. Perhaps more ruthless than the SS themselves. The film is shown more through a young American recruit who only has office training. He gets thrown into a tank and loses his virginity on the battle field and literally later on. His innocence is played off the animalistic crew members who resent him for not yet seeing the cruelty of war. They try to destroy his innocence. This happens in everyday life as well, but is more obvious in this movie. I just can never get over how the tank captain doesn't button up the tank in such obvious situations. Such as numerous sniper opportunities in towns, traveling on roads right next to heavy woods.....etc. Obviously it is to create scenarios that the script requires. The violence in the movie is realistic and maybe over the top for shock value. The utter disregard for caution by the lead tank and the German SS battalion at the end is beyond belief. This movie just uses the wwII setting to set up impossible situations to create the main hero.The one tender scene in the middle of the movie is just there to contrast against the brutal animals in the tank crew.",3,4,7,16 April 2018
