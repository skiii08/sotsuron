Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter
","This movie is a combination of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Ex-Presidents, and every comic book hero character. At least those are the ones that come to mind.The plot actually works in some bizarre, comic book and splash of history way. The cinematography is inviting and the acting is appropriately performed. Its CGI effects are exciting and gives just enough surrealism that doesn't seem over-the-top for the concept of the movie.I hope the next movie they make will be George Washington: Flame Thrower.",8,2,5,1 July 2012
