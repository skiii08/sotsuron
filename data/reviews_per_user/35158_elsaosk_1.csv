Vertigo," It's A great movie but very confusing
","I thought the characters were amazing and good actors
And I thought the story was nice but very confusing and I thought the music was dramatic but great and I thought Hitchcock's use of Color was great not to confusing and I like how the color are basic and what I most likes about the movie was when Scotti finds out that Judy was at the crime scene when Madeleine died and that it was judy that screamed and what I like least about the movie Was when Madeleine husbands was playing scotti and her and when Madeleine husband killd her.",10,1,3,2 December 2019
