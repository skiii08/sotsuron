The Incredible Hulk," Solid Hulk Film
","The Incredible Hulk is a movie that came out in 2008 when the the MCU was just starting the film is one of the most forgettable of the movies and the Hulk actor has been recast on later Hulk film, The Incredile hulk is really good movie with some not so good parts like the main villan does not come to play till a hour in the movie Edward Norton is a Great Bruce Banner howver not a very Hulk like cretature and i did like how the Stan Lee Cameo actually played into the plot of this movie unlike he did in other MCU Movies that we have seen as a side character i hate to say that on the Marvel Creator he was just put in for most of the MCU with little to no speaking lines at all in the films so i would gibe the movie a solid 8/10 or an 83% for a movie a great watch for any Marvel Fan",8,0,0,9 November 2019
