Resident Evil: Afterlife," Resident Evil: Afterthought
","Most everything about this sequel was poorly executed and unplanned. To begin with, the story had some major flaws with lots of forced conveniences. Doors automatically opened for the characters to then suddenly slam shut and lock behind them when necessary. An all-controlling I-pad like device was found conveniently lying around in a large empty ship hull for Alice to access. Somehow she knew exactly how to operate it (without mistrial) to free the frozen captives from below her! Clair somehow received an extreme make-over from being dirty, grungy and non-recognizable to drop-dead gorgeous in full makeup and hair all while being held hostage by Alice and tied inside of the two-seater red airplane that never seemed to run out of gas which flew a long journey from Canada to Los Angeles. How did Alice really know if there was enough food or any food at all on the Acadia when she broad-casted over the entire Western seaboard for any more survivors to come for food and shelter on the ship of already 100 or so passengers? The Actors obviously lacked any inkling of dramatic direction. Maybe the Director was more interested in Actors hitting their marks in front of the green screen. Now for the 3D aspect There was no point for this picture to be filmed in 3D because nothing except for the opening credits lent itself for 3-D in the first place. The lighting choices were always dark or severely contrasted against sunlight. Flashlights constantly pointing at the camera in 3D never work and end up annoying the audience. Sets, props and costuming mainly consisted of surfaces and colors (or lack of) that don't work in 3D. Inaccurate framing with very little stereo depth and no off-screen effects deadened the 3D as well. The sad thing is that anytime something could have come out of the screen, it cut away to something else and the final smack in the face as far 3D goes was a blood splatter that could have worked, but ended up on some unknown invisible glass window that was never there to begin with. I want my money back because it seems that no one of authority actually cared to make an effort to have the script corrected and they obviously didn't hire (or listen to) a seasoned stereoscopic supervisor, as no one had any idea what they were doing in 3D or basic screen writing. What a shame and a huge let down. F-.",1,5,12,24 September 2010
2012," Who am I to judge? It made money!!!
","So I arrived at the theater with low expectations to begin with and doing so greatly helped me to not walk out. It amazes me to no end why Hollywood continues to develop unbelievable scripts that are easily fixable from the start. Sometimes there are elements to a story that are so forced and inane, one wonders how these intelligence-insulting decisions are made to forge ahead and run with it. Yes, I was a tad dismayed that mythologies and prophecies were not examined more closely and most circumstances of survival scenes were completely over the top. It was freakish to me that Danny Glover, who was cast as the President of the United States, and the young lady that played his daughter were both previously cast years ago as two of the strangest characters in Oprah Winfrey's train wreck, 'Beloved'. But what truly bothered me is when vast modern technologies were used to create the ultimate series of Arks for human and animal survival, the plight of all the main character's lives were hanging by a thread because the boat's engine would not be able to start unless the gate was completely closed. Really? That's all you got? Utterly unforgivable and I want my money back. My numb rear end didn't appreciate this waste of time either! Just another lesson that it doesn't matter how bad a script is and how many good scripts they probably passed on – it's who knows who and who owes someone a favor – and how everyone in Hollywood operates on fear and are afraid to question the simplest of fixes. The real problem is that none of this matters; they made money and will continue to as long as the public continues buying into mediocrity.",3,3,6,15 November 2009
