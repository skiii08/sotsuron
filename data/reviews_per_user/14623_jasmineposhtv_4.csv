Ghost," FOREVER A CLASSIC
",Classic. I'm now 23 and own this on DVD. My mom used to watch it and I myself saw it once and fell in love. The acting is amazing and the plot was even better. It was some humor points with Whoopie in it and It flowed evenly with the love and suspense from Demi & Patrick. Still a must see & must have.,10,3,3,1 December 2018
Dirty Dancing," I have it on DVD
","It's crazy I have to put this but I'm 23 and this movie came out before my time YET I watched it since I was allowed to at a younger age. I always wondered why my mom watched it until I saw it for myself and fell in love. In love with the good girl loving the bad boy and the dancing is just amazing. I'm not really a dance movie type of girl but when you have so much pain, acceptance, trials and errors in one movie that's filled with overall love... how can you not love it? It's a must have.",10,1,2,1 December 2018
There's Something About Mary," 20 YEARS LATER
",I'm 23 and I still consider this one of my favorite movies of all time. I remember my mom watching it when I was younger and having the movie and I just decided to watch one day not even sure how it happened but from that point I LOVED IT. I laugh STILL every time I watch it. It's simple humor with a love story connected. I have it on DVD and even put some of my friends on to it and they love it just as much and even ask to borrow the dvd. They even thought it wouldn't be good UNTIL they watched. Highly recommend 20 years later.,10,1,2,1 December 2018
Creed II," A MUST SEE!!
","Let me start with the fact I was born in 95 and I loved rocky (even though it was before my time) the movie spoke on so many levels and deserved the spotlight it got! I was hoping the same for creed and I was UP MOST HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS. With this new generation usually the remakes are garbage to me because the originals are normally gone or the story line just doesn't flow correctly with the story. NOT THIS MOVIE. Not only did it have the perfect story line but it also refreshes your head to the rocky movie in case you happened to forget some parts. It was full of family , pain & dedication. This movie shows the trial and errors between creed and rocky's Life. I think what I love most about it is the fact rocky brought back that authentic 'rocky' while B. Jordan gave us that new feel YET equal to the struggle that rocky went through. I could care less for boxing but the fighting scenes where EVERYTHING !!! I highly recommend!!!",10,4,6,1 December 2018
