The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," don't watch it before the second one appears
","lower your expectations. it was just more like a wedding than a movie. i did not like any part of it: there were no action, no movement, only a few dreams and feelings of Bella that's all. despite i like to watch all types of films, i got bored in many scenes. i got surprised when the film was over because i thought it was starting at that moment. i think this part was not the subject that the director wants to issue. and i think that this part should be free to watch in theaters. on this way, they could achieve a good number of sales i think. on the other hand, there are a lot of fans of this series. maybe they would be happy to see Edward or Isabelle or Jacob...",3,12,26,18 November 2011
