Blade Runner 2049," I Shall Stick To My Rule To not Watch Sequels
","Every part of this movie is useless, absolutely boring. story is hilarious, and the characters are all useless and unneeded.Sure they put in a chick in a short skirt and a dog and we feel something, but the script is meaningless.",1,112,192,2 July 2019
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Pretty Sexy Babes and fun action
","What more could anyone want??Action, fantasy, flaunting thin babes, different realities and did I mention hot chicks? Yes, stay away if you like superior realities. Otherwise, this is why I purchase DVDs.",8,44,63,2 July 2019
