Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Totally in debt...
","Jack Sparrow, Barbossa and Mr. Gibbs are by far, the best combinations, they are the real comedians of this movie. I missed the rest of the Black Pearl's crew.Ang√©lica doesn't show her role clearly and she has a pointless quest (save her father from death, who was predicted to be killed by one man that has a wood-leg ), somehow she could be lovely for some people and totally annoying for others.Blackbeard doesn't show his role also, he has a great first entrance and 'that's it'....then he moves between being an evil man and a scared old man.The cleric and mermaid's love story is totally forgettable and bad acted by the cleric mainly.The real problem of this movie is the lack of detail explanations... the Blackbeard's sword seems to be an important item, but its origin was never described (this role was played in the anterior movies by Pintel and Ragetti, giving details over every mythic character or legends) the same fact with Blackbeard , the lost of the Barbossa's leg just has a couple of lines without any image showing the event, even in 'racconto' mode.In general lines, the movie lacks of story and details.",1,31,47,20 May 2011
