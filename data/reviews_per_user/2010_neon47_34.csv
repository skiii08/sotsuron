Requiem for a Dream," A reality check, if there ever was one.
","Requiem for a Dream is probably the most realistic fiction story I've ever bared witness to (and if this is based on a true story I didn't hear about it, I apologize and stand corrected). We see ourselves standing over the lives of four people who plan to finally achieve their dreams, for three of them it's money, for one it is to finally have the spot light reflecting off of her decaying skin as she gets a phone call stating that she is going to be on television. The movie is beautifully shot in a bizarre but unique manner. The characters are very human in their reactions and remain unpredictable and, in some cases, repulsive. I don't think the director could've done a better job shooting this. Bravo! First Pi and now this masterpiece. It's a shame nothing else has come from him yet.",10,1,2,11 September 2006
Se7en," oh yeah!
","Se7en is great. Need I go on? Alright... Se7en starts off nicely making it look like another day at work. Well it is, but it's the beginning of something big. Not 5min into the movie and we're introduced to the first murder scene which is a obese man with his hands tied together under the table and his face smashed into a pile of noodles. He's obviously dead. The killer in this movie picks his victims according to the seven deadly sins, which if you don't know are: greed, gluttony, lust, pride, wrath, envy, and sloth. The killer is very original in the style he kills his victims, which are often times very gruesome. Although they don't really show any killings in here just the way they implied lust was enough to turn my stomach. The movie does a great job with its dark setting and bad neighborhood. Symbolic that this city sucks and is run down. The acting by Mordan Freeman and Brad Pitt is sensational, as well as Kevin Spacy's acting, whom I praise for his role. Overall this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and the ending... oh buddy, the ending will getcha.",10,4,5,11 May 2005
Shaun of the Dead," Romance and zombies.
","Hands down this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. From the part where Shaun and Ed throw records at the zombies in the back yard to the part where Shaun and Ed plan out their mother's rescue (and step father's demise) this movie is sheer brilliance. The movie starts off where Shaun and Liz are discussing each other's friends and how they just don't like them. A day or so later, on their anniversary, Shaun and Liz break up. Another day later and the town is infested with zombies. Shaun overall is just having a bad day and in addition to that is oblivious to the fact that the town is infested with zombies. As the movie goes on we can't help but realize how a craving for beer and love can over take the fact that there's a group of zombies outside waiting to eat Shaun and Ed. I'd overall recommend this to British humor fans, zombie fans, horror/comedy fans, or people who are just in the mood for a good romantic comedy with zombies. This is a must see.",10,1,3,27 October 2005
Hostel," Give me gory or give me death (how bout both?).
","As 2006 opens up so does Hostel. I'll say this: what I got was what I expected and at the same time not what I expected. After seeing the preview for it in Saw 2 I figured I had to see it. I also immediately figured that there was going to be a lot of comparisons of Hostel to Saw 2, and that's perfectly understandable. To those who haven't seen this yet: Hostel, in my humble opinion, makes the gore in Saw 2 look like a Walt Diseny movie. This movie is absolutely brutal. The movie in the first half hour however, leads you to believe you're going to be watching another Girls Gone Wild video instead of seeing brutal scenes of torture. The nudity portion of the movie is consistent with the gore portion. Three friends are traveling around Europe looking to get stoned and get laid. After taken in by a guy in Amsterdam they're told about another country where they're going to get laid pretty much for free. They take a train over there and get exactly what they came for. Soon one of their friends disappears, and then another, until we're left with one character (sorry I'm bad with names). Desperate to find out what happened to his friends he goes on a search into a run down building to find that for a price you can do anything you want to anyone. That's the basic summery. Overall the movie is 45min of smoking pot and naked girls, and 55min of torture. The story isn't that strong but keeps the movie going. The scary thing is, is the fact that this is based upon true events. I'd recommend this to horror movie fans, Saw fans, and gore fans (which normally all run in the same category).",6,0,1,9 January 2006
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," So Exrteme You'll Love It
","If you're not a fan of non-stop swearing, crude humor, musicals, satire, violence, or just South Park in general then don't watch this. Trey Parker and Matt Stone hold nothing back during this movie. Everything they can't get away with on television they do so with Bigger, Longer, and Uncut. Weather anyone believes it or not BLU is a musical in every respect. From the intro song(Small Mountain Town) to the money number(Uncle F*cker, which you will find yourself singing in the shower), this is a musical top to bottom. The movie kicks off with the kids going to see the Terrance and Phillip movie where they hear so many bad words they become corrupted and begin to use them in their every day lives. Kyle's mom is so outraged by this film that she, along with the rest of South Park, manage to get the United States to go to war with Canada for sending the Terrance and Phillip movie to America. Stan, Kyle, and Cartmen form a resistance group to fight their parents and the war, and Kenny goes to Hell where Satan and Saddam (who are gay lovers in the movie) plan on taking over Earth by using the war. This movie is so great it's hard not to love it, especially since it made the Book of World Records for 399 swear words and 128 offensive gestures. Parker and Stone out-did themselves with this movie. You'll laugh until you hurt.",10,79,94,7 June 2005
Constantine," I'm liking this...
","Constantine was worth the price of admission, and what I loved is that it exceeded my expectations. Keanu Reeves plays a good bad ass which is exactly what John Constantine is. This movie actually seemed to me like it was a story and then a different story and then a different story, but it all flowed pretty nicely. The way water is used in the movie, as portals and such, was a very interesting and unique idea. I was satisfied with the ending, hopefully it'll be followed by a worthy sequel. The only complaint I have is Satan... he's not scary, and he wears white. That just kinda baffled me. Perhaps it was meant to be ironic... perhaps not. I guess that part is for you to interpret. Either way, the comic book scene is becoming bigger now and there's bound to be more movies made based on comics. I recommend this movie to anyone who like bad ass heroes with almost no remorse. See it, it's worth it.",8,4,10,15 May 2005
Brokeback Mountain," Hmmmm....
","I have to say overall I wasn't as impressed with Brokeback Mountain as I expected to be. Sure it was a great movie but I just didn't grasp the story like I expected to. The acting was superb everything felt real, the forbidden romance... but I've seen this already in other movies, mainly Romeo and Juliet. Only this time it's Romeo and Jecht, which I don't find there to be any problem with but I guess I was going in expecting too much. There really wasn't an epic story, more it was a story of secrets. Both character's lives fell apart because of each other but something about this movie felt so empty. I am but a humble reviewer, out of all of the people that I know that have seen this only one was completely in love with it. It'll be something I throw in every now and then, but I think I'll just stick to my R&J. See this if you haven't, it really is a good movie, it just didn't feel that... 'fresh' to me.",8,2,19,1 May 2006
Ed Wood," A good movie that's about bad movies.
","Is it just me or are Johnny Depp and Tim Burton an unstoppable force? Why is it that every movie they make is so good? As always, B & D don't disappoint in Burton's take on the life of Edward D. Wood Jr., the worst movie director of all time (well whoever did Pumpkinhead 2 took the the cake from Ed Wood, but I'm guessing that guy will never work on movies again). The acting is done well as always, especially the intentional bad acting, which is harder than it looks. I liked the fact that it was done in black and white, it gave the movie an aged look which is exactly what it needed. Depp in drag was definitely one of the movies high points. Bill Murry played, as always, an unusual part which was very suited for him (if you get the Special Edition DVD you can hear him sing Que Sera Sera in a slaughter house). The guy who played Bela Lugousi looked a lot like Bela Lugousi. It was a frightening resemblance. The overall movie is really weird, and those who have seen Charlie and the Chocolate Factory will realize that Depp's acting in Ed Wood is very similar to that in Charile. Very smiley, very happy. I recommend it to everyone, especially those who like Plan 9 From Outerspace, and Tim Burton movies. It won't disappoint.",9,1,1,22 December 2005
Corpse Bride," Magical.
","I know that there's a lot of people out there who are ready to compare this to The Nightmare Before Christmas, but there's no comparison. Corpse Bride and Nightmare aren't the same movie. Sure they're both Tim Burton and they're both done in a puppet style but they're essentially different mainly because Nightmare was a musical and Corpse Bride is simply a romantic graveyard comedy. Bride does have a few songs but not enough to make it a musical. Depp ends up doing the voice of Victor, who as usual in a Burton movie, does another stellar job. The movie is shot in a Victorian era making it very cool to watch. The music is done great as well; very suiting and very beautiful. The story isn't complex but it's also not meant to be. The movie is directed more towards children than adults, but that of course doesn't mean adults can't enjoy it as much as children. I highly recommend this to Nightmare Cultists, Burton fans, Halloween buffs, or anyone who likes an all around good movie.",10,4,7,11 October 2005
Romeo + Juliet," Moderized Without Losing the Shakespeare
","I'm a sucker for William Shakespeare even though I like it done better in the theatre. This one however, kept my attention and seemed to do a great job with modernizing the whole quarreling families thing. The movie kicks off with a street brawl between the Montegues and Capulets. The Prince forewarns them that if they ever disturb the peace again their 'lives will pay the forfeit of the peace.' We are then introduced to the character Romeo who is played by Leonardo DeCaprio. Leo does a great job as Romeo, but that's because Leo is a good actor in this film. Soon after that we are introduced to Juliet who is played by the beautiful Claire Danes, someone I haven't seen in too many movies. Danes does a great job playing the flirty Juliet. The movie follows the original script very accurately. The symbolism is also used very well throughout the movie. If you look at the guns you'll notice that some say sword, some say rapier, and I believe some say dagger. The Montegues always wear a Hawaiian style shirt. The Capulets dress more like mobsters or thugs even though both sides could be viewed as thugs in some sort or another. In either case each family wears a certain kind of clothing that makes it easy to tell who's who. One great part I absolutely love is the party. Juliet wears angel wings and Romeo wears a knight outfit. Romeo's best friend (and I wish I could spell his name but I'd rather not butcher it) dresses up as a women. So to explain this form of symbolics, for those who aren't getting it, it's Romeo is the 'knight in shinning armor,' Juliet is the angel of Romeo's dreams, and Romeo's best friend is the comic relief. There's other things you'll notice at the party also, like Tybalt wears devil horns(i.e. he's a villain). Both families you'll also notice are rich, which also follows the script accurately. Overall, if you're a Shakespeare fan, a fan of romantic movies, a fan of tragic movies, or a fan of artistic movies then make sure to look into this one. It'll sweep you off you're feet, make you laugh, make you cry, and make you fall in love.",9,119,180,7 June 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," Pretty eh.
","As usual, the original Matrix was the best. Reloaded was a solid follow up but didn't leave as much in question, or as much in replay value, as the original did. Revolutions however... I dunno. I got sick of the real world pretty fast in here, if you didn't like the real world in Reloaded prepare for some hell because about 75% of this movie takes place in the real world. Also, much like Reloaded, there isn't as much to learn about the Matrix as there was in the first one. It seems almost assumed that there is little left to learn about the Matrix which is more than just a little disappointing. Actors did just as good of jobs in this one as they did in the previous Matrixs. This one however I was most disappointed with. Mostly the ending is what made me frown but the final battle was another thing I yawned at. Sorry but leave a battle like this for the animes, it looks better. The Smith fight in Reloaded was 10 times better than this one. If you've seen the other two seeing this one probably won't do a whole lot for you. You'll probably end up frowning at the ending (much like I did). Movies with this much potential shouldn't feel so empty in the end.",7,0,0,5 May 2006
The Village," Ummm... Ahhh... Hmmmm.... I don't really know...
","I am stuck in the dead middle with this one. It's really good, but it's really bad. It exceeds my expectations... but then again I kinda didn't like that. The movie bases itself out in the wilderness in a vacant field where a small Amish community lives. No one is allowed in the woods because of the creatures that live in there. The creatures are called Those We Don't Speak Of, if memory serves correctly. One day a young male villager goes into the woods and comes back. That basically ticks off Those We Don't Speak Of and from there on things start to get ugly. The plot really is kinda genius if you take the time to think it over after the movie ends. There are somethings that I wish would just change about this one. It's good, but at the same time it's bad.",5,1,2,22 August 2005
BASEketball," This should be a sport.
","Why the crap is this movie rated so low?! I've seen this movie over 25 times, I know EVERY line to this movie. It's obvious that I love this movie. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (creators of South Park and the new puppet masterpiece Team America) star as the main characters Joe Cooper, or Coop 'Airman' Cooper, and Doug Remer, or 'Sir Swish.' Mainly they're just referred to as Coop and Remer throughout the movie. Right as the movie starts it reminds us of the money hungry corrupt world of overpaid sports starts, they even go as far as to make one up called 'Townsell.' I must quote this portion of the movie since it is true with some sports starts: 'And after playing for New England, San Diego, Huston, Saint Louis, a year for the Toronto Arganauts, plus one season as a greater at the Desert Inn I'm happy to finally play here in the fine city of Miami.' His agent leans over: 'Minnesota.' Let us not forget this important piece of the movie. So it starts that Coop and Remer are at a high school reunion party and realize they are still nothing as they talk to their old classmates. Outside they create the sport BASEketball after being challenged by what probably was high school basketball heroes. After shaming them the sport goes pro in about a year. During this time they manage to recruit their third team mate Squeak, which is actually a day after they invent the game. As the movie follows we find out that Coop, Remer, and Squeak are the only virtuous sports heroes left. The story follows with zany blackmail, the Milwaukee Beers cheerleaders, and humor so absurd it'll leave you crying for more. Watch it dude, it's hilarious.",10,39,57,15 May 2005
Edward Scissorhands," Burton's untouchable.
","Some movies will never have an equal, some just shine above the rest untouched by everything else. Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands is one of those. The cast is great with Johnny Depp as Edward Scissorhands and Vincent Price as his creator (and also in his last role ever). Edward is an artificial human who was perfect in almost every way, left unfinished by the untimely death of his creator, only known as The Inventor, with scissors for hands. After living by himself for awhile, Edward is discovered and taken home to experience a world outside of The Inventor's lab and thus begins his adventures. Edward's fable is told like a children's story, starting off with a child lying in bed and the grandma telling her about where the snow comes from. Tim Burton shows his imagination at its best here. While The Nightmare Before Christmas was really good, Edward Scissorhands still stands as his strongest film. If any of Burton's movies are to go down as classics this will be the one. Brilliant.",10,2,3,5 May 2006
Collateral," Good but not great.
","I hate Tom Cruise. I can't stand him for the life of me, nearly everything he's done has done more than just annoy the sh*t out of me, however, after receiving several 'this movie is great' from friends, I decided to give it a spin. This is one of the first Tom Cruise movies that hasn't made me shut it off early. That doesn't mean that the movie itself is a stellar achievement. If I recall correctly there's a little Michael Mann movie called Heat (and feel free to correct me if I'm wrong) that was at least 10 times better than this. Collateral takes us through an evening with Jamie Foxx (Max) and Tom Cruise (Vincent) as Cruise makes five hits. Unfortunately, I was able to guess the plot twists which were good but easy to see coming. The action is very intense which put a smile on my face, especially when Cruise executed the guy who stole his brief case. However, when the action isn't on all we see is arguments, threats, and some character development. The way Foxx develops in the movie was to be expected which wasn't bad because I was getting sick of his character. Collateral is worth watching, but if you're thinking about buying wait until it hits the $7 mark.",6,0,0,7 August 2006
Dark City," Akira meets the first Matrix.
","Dark City holds the ideas of a great innovative sci-fi that could've been a masterpiece for its time. Unfortunately the movie falls short in a few areas making it a mostly decent sci-fi. The first 10min of the movie give us the monologue of a traitor and the awakening of the main character, John Murdoch. John has no idea who he is or where he is, all he knows is that there's a dead call girl in his room and it's time for him to split. Don't let this mislead you into thinking the entire movie is fast paced, truth is, it's just as 'stop-go' as a Penzoil commercial. The Strangers however, the group hunting John, are a harrowing race of people that you'd think would appear in a Marylin Manson video. The Strangers have the ability to 'tune' which allows them to alter reality around them. Unfortunately they don't use their powers too often to try and stop John. Watching this only kept reminding me of the mysteries of the first Matrix movie and the anime masterpiece Akria in which the character Tetsuo tapped into his psychic powers. If you've seen both Akria and the Matrix you'll likely enjoy Dark City, if you haven't I suggest checking out those before you see this.",8,0,2,13 July 2006
The Nightmare Before Christmas," What Christmas Should Be Like Someday
","This movie is a lot of fun. It really is. I first saw it when I was younger and thought it was good but pretty much forgot about it until this last Christmas when I saw it on display. Back then I was into horror and demented stuff like that, now I'm about 100 times more into horror and demented stuff like that (Johnny the Homicidal Manaic for those of you who know what that is). The Nightmare Before Christmas is something that I'd like to actually see happen someday, but I know it won't. Tim Burton kicks off this one with the lovely introduction 'This is Halloween' theme song and goes from there to introduce characters. Soon we find out that the king of Halloween (Jack) is sick of doing the same thing every year and wants something different. So after the party Jack wanders off into a section of the woods he's never seen and comes across trees with symbols on them. Jack ends up falling into the Christmas one and discovers a new holiday he is eager to celebrate. Soon Jack gathers the whole town and introduces them to what Christmas is. The only person who wants to stop him is the girl (Sally) who loves him. Sally has a bad feeling about all of it after holding a small twig and watching it burn in her hands. The only thing Jack needs to do to complete his plan is capture Santa, the Big Red Man himself. The movie is really good but it's really short. The music is done well for the most part, the songs didn't get stuck in my head but that's not always a bad thing. It's a must-see for Tim Burton fans and I strongly recommend it if your in a Halloween mood, Christmas mood, or Hallo-mas, you know.",10,0,1,7 June 2005
The Evil Dead," Eeeeviiil.....!
","Please realize that I'm not trying to look down on this movie. It's a good movie, but it lacks a plot. That was my only real dilemma with this movie. The only thing that happens is the group listens to a tape that awakens the dead, then the forest (yes the forest) captures a girl and everything goes from bad to worse from there. But when it comes to horror movies Evil Dead shines as an original because it uses the 'Deadites' a type of evil dead zombie that's actually kinda smart. The Deadites are obsessed with eating souls. I have to say that I was surprised at the amount of gore used in this, but that's probably because I saw AoD first. Out of the three movies (Evil Dead, ED2:Dead by Dawn, AoD) this one has the most 'no non-sense' feel to it, it has a much deeper fixation on horror than the other two which mixed comedy elements into them. Horror fans are sure to get a kick out of this as it is a really great horror movie (it's a really great horror series). I recommend it to horror fans who don't need a deep story to get their fix and gore fans because some of this is beautifully brutal.",10,1,2,6 June 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Kill em all.
","NOW THIS IS A MOVIE! Only Q.T. could've done something this great. The dialouge, the violence, the drama, the action, every aspect of this movie rocks. Kicking off with a harrowing introduction that is sure to haunt you in your sleep, Kill Bill vol. 1 pretty much makes you want to be on The Bride's side doing some killing. While this one doesn't fixate itself much on the story or the background history of what happened to The Bride, the movie doesn't really need to. Rather it straps you down for a roller coaster ride of pure action. The material arts is top notch, especially at the big show down at the end. The comedic parts are actually funny. The animated history of Oni-wan is dazzling. Sure they over-do it on the blood but so what? Half of the stuff they do in here can't be done in real life anyway, so just sit back, enjoy and turn your bullshit alarms off. This is the first installment of a movie that is going to dazzle you. See it now.",10,1,3,27 October 2005
Saw II," Listen very closely.
","Very very seldom does a sequel ever shine as bright as Saw 2. Very seldom does a sequel go above and beyond its other half... but Saw 2 does all of this. Fans of the first rejoice because Saw 2 does compare and sometimes outshines one of the most under-your-skin movies of our time. The blood has been kicked up a couple notches and some of the traps are even more harrowing than the last (i.e. the death mask or the Chinese 'blade' trap). The movie starts as a kick in the pants (just like the first) and makes certain you're aware that the games are not over. The beginning can be a little slow for those who just want blood and gore, but I was able to stomach it. It's actually kind of necessary once you get a grasp on the story. Once we skip ahead to the house that the players are trapped in, the movie kicks into high gear. Slowly the characters are dying because of the nerve gas they breath in and, this in turn, blurs their sense of reasoning and, often times, logical decision making. The ending is not what I expected and that's a good thing. After the movie was over I knew I got my $8 worth. I highly recommend this to people who know what good movies are. I've read some paper reviews on this, and clearly those people don't know what a 'movie' is. If you haven't watched the first Saw, don't worry. You can still enjoy this one with little or no previous knowledge of the first movie. If you have seen the first Saw then clearly you rock. Just heed my advice before watching: listen very closely.",10,0,2,6 November 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Charlie and the Chocolate Factory... Tim Burton Style!
","Let's be honest here... this movie is warped. But that's not a bad thing at all, in fact it seems to add more life to it that way. I just saw this two days ago in the local theater and I have to say it was worth the overpriced tickets. I heard a lot of people say the original is better, but I've heard that this is closer to the book than the one with Gene Wilder. I haven't read the book so I'm not going to argue that statement. In many respects I did like this version better, but they did leave out some classic scenes. I don't want to spoil that for you however. Let's get down to business. Depp puts on a stellar performance like always, I couldn't have asked for more. The boy who plays Charlie also did a good job. So acting is right on the buttons. The Oompaloompas are only played by one man. Literally, that's all, just one guy plays every Oompaloompa. I guess that's one way to save cash. The story is the same as the old one; if you don't know the story or have never seen the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory then I'm just going to assume that you are technologically deprived. The thing about this version is that it has a deeper story with Willy Wonka than the original. This adds a little more depth to the movie. The set design is beautiful and like always, a bit eerie; just the way it should be done. I do like this version better than the original, not by much but it's with out doubt a worthy remake.",8,3,6,21 July 2005
Big Fish," Tim Burton's Best Yet
","If there's one reason to see Big Fish it's because it's like nothing you've ever seen before. I love the work of Tim Burton and that's what mostly drew me to this movie. I honestly don't know where to begin with this review, there is just so much to say about the story and the dilemmas between the father(Edward) and the son(Albert). The movie mostly fixates itself around the stories Edward has told to his son. It begins where Edward tells the story of the day Albert is born, and how his Edward caught an uncatchable fish. During this it goes through a montage of years passing and eventually ends up where Edward is telling the story at his son's wedding and Albert not liking it. Believing that his father has lied to him throughout all the years Albert and Edward go their separate ways for a few years before Albert gets a call from his mom finding out that his father is on his deathbed. Albert decides he has to go see his dad before time runs out and find out the truth behind all the tall tales. The movie really is a very heart warming story and by the end I was choking up. The ending is really good, it's something you'll never see coming. I can see why it was nominated for 4 Golden Globe Awards and got an Academy Award Nominee for Best Original Score. The acting in this movie is outrageous. They couldn't have picked a better cast. The adventure int his movie is out of this world, and I'm not exaggerating on that. The adventure is very big indeed. Out of all the movies Tim Burton has done, Big Fish shines in his collection.",10,0,0,7 June 2005
Saw," interesting concept...
","Had anything in this movie happened to me I'd have lost it a lot faster than the actors did. Saw does a pretty good job as a breath of fresh air to the horror genre. But it didn't really scare me, no horror movie has really ever scared me or gave me nightmares. I have read lots of mixed reviews about this movie, some praise it some hate it. Mostly what I've found are comparisons to Se7en. No move compares to Se7en; end of story. Saw takes place in what appears to be a vacant bathroom that's probably been abandoned for 20 years or so. As they say the first 10 minuets of the movie are the most important. Well that is true, and this movie will have you going until the acting begins. The acting in the beginning sucks, but it does get better as the movie progresses. The ending was played out beautifully, which is probably one of the best parts of the movie. The death scenes in here are pretty good too. And of course the gore factor... it's really not that bad. The only nasty parts are when the girl is going through the opium-upped guy's stomach to search for a key, and the part where one of the cops gets a portion of his head blown off. This movie will also keep you guessing until the very end, no one I ever talked to guessed it was coming. Overall if you're a horror fanatic then see this movie, but don't compare it to you're beloved Se7en.",8,0,1,11 May 2005
Pulp Fiction," Classic
","If one movie has everything in it this is it. From hit men, to romantic dinners this one has it all. The movie follows an odd sequence and kinda skips around, but in the end it's better that way. The movie casts a memorable performances by Sammuel L. Jackson and John Travolta followed by gorgeous and catchy dialouge of QT (i.e. 'I just shot Marvin in the face!')that never lets down on the viewer. Heed the definition of 'pulp' that's at the beginning of the movie, otherwise you might walk away a little disappointed. Weather you're in the mood for action, comedy, drama, or all of the above this movie will deliver with satisfaction.",10,2,5,22 August 2005
Wedding Crashers," Good, funny, predictable.
","Take the first American Pie and put it in a wedding setting right away - no high school. Your result would probably be The Wedding Crashers, only with more character dilemma in the beginning. While The Wedding Crashers is a decent movie, the truth is once you get so far you don't really need to see anymore. It's actually a rather long movie for a comedy. Owen Wilson plays.... Owen Wilson (the same role I've seen him in in every movie he stars in). Vincent Vaugh does a good job, I'm happy to see him rise as an actor even though he does seem to play the same part on occasion. The story is one you've seen before, Wilson meets a girl, wants her, finds out she's taken, and then fights for her heart. I've seen this formula before, so there really weren't any surprises after that. If you like this kind of formula in a movie then you'll find yourself completely entertained but if you're like me and you'd like to see some new twists then just remember you won't find them here. Although it's still entertaining.",7,1,3,5 May 2006
Man on Fire," The feel good movie of the year.
","Paitence when watching this movie. Just wait a little bit. Wait for characters to develop, wait for the connection between Dakota Fanning and Denzel Washington. Paitence is all that's require for the first bit of this movie. After that it's time for all hell to break loose. Man On Fire is my feel good movie of the year. Why? Well, that's a pretty easy question to answer: because everything Washington's character does to the bad guys just feel so right. From the C4 incident to the rough interrogations, everything Washington does is merciless as should be. The killings are done in a very artistic fashion, the plot twists will open your eyes, and when this beast of a movie ends the only thing that's going to be quivering on your lips is: 'Oh, hell yeah!' To be completely honest this is a must-see. There is no reason you shouldn't get off your computer this very second to go and rent this masterpiece. The entire plot is very well written, the interrogations make it so you don't miss a word said, and the ending will leave you feeling warm and fuzzy inside and yet at the same time, it will bring a tear to your eye. Go rent or buy this, now. I'm not asking you I'm telling you. This movie will not disappoint, and after it's all over you'll realize why it's the feel good movie of the year.",10,1,3,7 November 2005
Army of Darkness," Gimme Some Sugar, Baby
","This is the final chapter in the Evil Dead series. If you haven't watched either Evil Dead or Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn don't worry. This movie has nothing to do with the first Evil Dead and neither does Dead by Dawn. But enough about that. This movie fills in the blank spots right in the beginning so you don't have to worry about missing something vital. This movie seems to back away from the extreme use of gore and instead uses a more of an adventure feel. Ash is now trapped in the past and in order to get back he needs to get the Book of the Dead from a grave yard. Seems simple, but Ash can't quiet remember the three words the wise man told him to recite before removing the book. So Ash awakens an Army of Darkness and ticks off the whole medieval culture he's currently living in. Overall the movie is pretty good, more fixation on comedy than on anything remotely scary. The movie is pretty cheesy which could be a problem if you don't like cheesy humor. Ash does have some pretty good catch lines, I mostly recommend this to the Evil Dead fans but some who didn't like the first two may very well find this one a fresh step in a different direction.",10,2,4,6 June 2005
Halloween," Michael Meyers is the greatest slasher.
","I don't rate this one according to today's standards, if that were so then this would be just barley above Jeepers Creepers. Halloween was original for its time, before the 10 million Halloween rip offs like Friday the 13th. As said the first 10mins of a movie are the most important and Halloween lets us know that from the very beginning. Michael kills his older sister and shortly after is caught by his parents and sent off to a psycho-ward. Fifteen years later he returns on the night of Halloween. I almost saw H20 first but decided to wait on that. Instead I rented this to see the roots of the then long line of Halloween movies. I was intoxicated after the first view and immediately had to see the second Halloween. Michael Meyers is the greatest slasher of all time. In my book he was the first, although it could be argued that Norman Bates was the first. Halloween has a very original feel right from the beginning all the way to the end. See it if you're a fan of horror and slasher films. The mystery behind it is well thought out and played out.",10,0,1,16 May 2005
Casino," One of the most under-rated movies ever.
","Most people I know haven't seen the true-story brutality that is Casino. Taking place in the early 1980s, two mob friends, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, are put in charge of a Las Vegas casino. Their job? To make certain everything runs smooth and to make sure that the bosses get their black bag of money. What happens? To put it into a short context: things start to fall apart. The dysfunction represented in this movie is amazing, every little thing leads to something worse. The beginning shows the rise of the Mafia's empire in Las Vegas: from the towering casinos to the floors of the casino, you get a little taste of everything in here. What's really interesting is that if you played by the rules, they treated you like gold, but if you double crossed them things could get pretty ugly (see the hammer scene). Casino, put simply, is a great movie. The only problem I experienced was that there were parts that seemed to drag out. The movie weighs in at a hefty 2hrs and 59min so don't expect to go anywhere soon. If you haven't see this yet then give it a chance, it really is a great movie.",8,4,6,5 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Best Trilogy Ever...
","Of course now it's not really a trilogy anymore is it? But the title refers to episodes 4-6. Now on to the review: Star Wars is hands down the best clash of good and evil any person can find in movies ever. For those who haven't seen it, and shame if you haven't, this one kicks off in the middle of a war in space between the Emperor and the Rebels. Luke lives on a desert planet and longs to join the rebellion, but can't because his Uncle Ben doesn't want him to. Shortly into the movie the family purchases some droids and Luke soon finds a message hidden in R2D2's data for an Obi Wan Kenobi. Things kick into gear once Luke follows the droid to Kenobi's house and thus begins the adventure. Obi Wan believes that Luke can turn out to be a Jedi just like his father was and takes him under his wing teaching him the way of the Force once they get off Tattooin. During the movie you'll run into the memorable characters like the evil Darth Vader, the cocky Han Solo, Chewy the Wookie, and Princess Leia. Hands down episodes 4-6 are the best trilogy ever created. See it now if you haven't already.",10,4,7,8 June 2005
Sin City," beautiful
","Although beautiful isn't exactly the word I'd use to describe the state of the city, the corruption, the framing and all that, the movie was shot beautifully. Probably the best thing about this movie is that it follows the comics almost word for word page for page. There was only one part that was edited out of the movie, and it wasn't anything significant (Marv visits his mother in the comic before visiting Claire). The only downsides that I found were that the stories are barley intertwined and the beginning doesn't have anything to do with the rest of the movie. They do connect but on a very small level. Overall this movie is worth seeing in theaters, if it's still in one of your theaters. Great acting, nice use of the random color effect. Go see it now.",9,0,1,11 May 2005
Donnie Darko," thinking................
","Donnie Darko, from what I have heard, has been labeled a modern day cult classic. The movie fixes itself around a high school kid named Donnie Darko, hence the name of the movie. Donnie has problems, lots of problems. He suffers from social anxiety, bullying, sleep walking, and nightmare visions/daylight hallucinations of a demonic looking rabbit who give him jobs and prophecies. The movie fixes itself heavily around the discovery of the fourth dimension and time travel. I originality saw the regular cut version until I bought the directors cut. If you plan on seeing this movie get the director's cut. The original doesn't reveal nearly as much as the director's cut. This movie does a great job of screwing with your mind and leaves you guessing up until the very end. Richard Kelly wrote a great script, and I believe this movie is successful because of the main character. Donnie has so many problems and ideas that every teen deals with on a day to day basis. See this movie, it is great.",10,0,1,11 May 2005
Princess Mononoke," Brilliant and Beautiful
","This has to be one of the best anime's I've seen since Neon Genesis Evangelion. It's lush and beautiful. The story begins with the hero, Ashitaka, defending his village from an attacking demon. Ashitaka fights bravely but is touched by the beast and falls to a curse that will consume his body unless he finds the Spirit of the Forest (which is like a 100 point buck). During his travels ends up staying at a village that minds iron. Hence the name Iron Town. Ashitaka soon finds that Iron Town and the forest are at war. During his stay Princess Mononoke, her name throughout the movie is mainly San, attacks. Ashitaka breaks up the fight between M'lady (leader of Iron Town) and San. Soon Ashitaka finds himself caught up in the battle. The story is magnificent and makes for a great D&D scenario for you geeks out there (long live D&D). I have absolutely no complaints about this movie. I love the ending, which is something I'm VERY picky with. I recommend this to anyone who loves anime, adventure, and/or Record of Lodoss War.",10,0,2,15 May 2005
Evil Dead II," Is this really a... sequel?
","I still can't understand yet if this is a sequel or a remake. There's no connection between Evil Dead and it's 'sequel' Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn. If you've seen Evil Dead 1 then you should know the drill with this one. While this isn't in anyway at all a bad movie, it doesn't do much to go above and beyond the gory glory of its older, and superior, brother. Dead By Dawn pretty much kicks off from the very beginning with people being possessed by the dead. This version has a bit more of a twist, and this is also the movie where Ash gets his signature 'boomstick' and chainsaw arm. Dead By Dawn also focuses more so on being a horror comedy, still leaning more towards horror, instead of being a full fledged horror like the older brother. It does succeed in doing this, but falls short at a few parts. Overall this is a worthy... uh... sequel? It's got a two in front of the name so I guess we can call it that. Just realize that there is NO connection (at least that I could find) between this and Evil Dead 1. I highly recommend it to those already fans of Evil Dead 1. Watch the first if you haven't seen this one yet, the overall series is very good, especially Army of Darkness.",10,4,5,27 October 2005
