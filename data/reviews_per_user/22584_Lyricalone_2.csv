The Ring," Think twice about putting a tape in the VCR.
","This movie keeps you questioning, and wondering. Overall I loved it. Very different, very deep. Some small details could have been more explained, but it is still worth seeing. The best movie I have seen in a long time.",Null,0,0,19 October 2002
Saw," Excellent
","As a screenwriter who studies many films, I can honestly say that this is an original. Yes many people will try to compare it to,'Silence Of The Lambs' or 'Seven.' However, it is a psychological thriller....genres of any kind can be compared to other films in their genre. What makes this film unique is its intense plot points to carry the film and the ending is a master mind creation. I will absolutely keep an eye out for the director 'James Wan.' To create a film of this magnitude in shooting of only 18 days is dedication.And Leigh will absolutely have to do more acting along with writing because his talent is remarkable. I believe both of these professionals will enlighten and entertain us to greater degrees in the future.",Null,0,1,17 February 2005
