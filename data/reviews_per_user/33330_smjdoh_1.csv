Walk the Line," Just thought it was brilliant
","This is time I ever enjoyed a film so much I felt the need to comment somewhere publicly.The film was subtly observed, extremely moving and, above all, inspiring. The portrayal of a man's near destruction by the demons of guilt and addiction, and his eventual rescue by the power of love and determination gives us all hope.Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix were phenomenal - giving masterful, heartfelt and totally authentic performances. They completely re-created the essence of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash without ever making you feel that you were witnessing imitation. I felt that they were wholly the characters and wholly themselves - the highest compliment you can give an actor.I haven't seen Capote yet, but, in any other year, Phoenix would have grabbed the trophy.Big kudos to Mangold too, for the sensitivity in which he told the story and his ability to pull these performances from the whole cast. It was beautifully framed and never at any moment one bit sappy.Finally, T Bone Burnett deserves massive praise for his uncanny ability to re-create one of the most exciting times in music ever. Right down the list, every note rang true, with Cash & Carter, Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and the rest brought to life for us. I feel like I was there to see and hear it all for the first time.",10,2,4,12 March 2006
