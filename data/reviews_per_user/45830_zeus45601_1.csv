First Man," Terrible Casting and many historical inaccuracies, Hard to watch.
","Taking the angle this Director took was ridiculous portraying Neil Armstrong as an android like character, dwelling on the deaths in his life, being a cold family man and father, as well as spacey to his colleagues at NASA. It really never addressed his many accomplishments, his clearheadedness during pressure. It portray Buzz Aldrin as a pompous know-it-all and none of the actors even resembled any of the astronauts including Mr. Gosling whom a respect as an actor but wasn't right for this part. The movie was WAY too out there for my tastes and wished it had been a bit more like the Right Stuff.",2,2,3,1 February 2019
