The Hangover," Flat out funny!!
","I would give it an 8.5 but you can't. It is a hilarious movie I have not laughed some much at the theater in my life. I was even tearing up I laughed so hard at times. I don't want to give away anything but another good thing is it is not one of those movies that shows all the funny parts in the trailers. Although they don't show the tiger in the elevator scene in the actual movie.It is very entertaining and is of the Old School and Road Trip mentality and has the usual cameo by Phillips. Don't go in expecting the best movie in the last 10 years, just know it will be funny and worth the $10 bucks. The cast fit well with each other and kept me laughing most of the movie, make sure you watch the credits.",8,1,3,24 June 2009
Citizen Kane," AFI #1 but not mine
","Peter Griffin of the Family Guy said it best 'It was his sled. It was his sled from when he was a kid. There, I just saved you two long boobless hours'. Kane was about the only movie I have never been able to finish, maybe I'll try again some day. I can think of many better ways to spend 2 hours like watching the 'Godfather' or 'Shawshank'. I just could not relate to the story. It is about a tycoon who becomes a recluse, it sounds like a good story but it was so long and drawn out I fell asleep and had to stop watching. I was disappointed mainly because the first time AFI came out with the top 100 movies of all time I wanted to see the best of the best. Many of the top 100 films I had seen, many more I hadn't (seen) and a few of the ones I hadn't seen were films in AFI's top ten. 'Casablanca' is good I can see that, it is not in my top ten but its good. The 'Godfather' is a masterpiece but for all the talk about the 'Kane' I was extremely disappointed.",1,44,86,26 July 2007
