Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," why there is no zero for rating
","don't watch this stupid childish movie.the action is fake and storyline is........well there was no story line.maybe its my fault to watch this kidsplay after watching 'the good the bad and the ugly'.don't watch this.a complete waste of time. Director has no control over storylie.actors are completely clueless. Not a good idea to make such a childish crap on a historical icon like Lincoln. Hollywood is known for creativity. But these days they are making craps like Abraham Lincoln, mysterious Iceland, twilight.........etc. Its not wonder that we could see another sequel of this film. I am not against sequels but please this is a boring plot. Its better to watch old flicks like dollar series. Huge disappointment from this so called film.",1,1,3,17 April 2013
