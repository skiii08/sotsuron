Skyfall," go.od and not so
","The problem with Bond films is the insistence on the same or similar formula. This tends to rule out or at least inhibit the development of a good storyline. Having read all Ian Flemings books, I wish just one would start in his apartment, early morning, does his press ups, prepares his scrambled eggs etc, instead of always a precipitous action start. Having said that Skyfall must be one of the best beginnings to any Bond film. The first twenty minutes was spectacular and beautifully filmed. When the adverts came on I just said, 'follow that'. This is where it fell down ,it couldn't. The story reverted to the usual formulaic pattern, and the script was frankly sub standard. I know the one liners are usually quite corny, but at least they are funny, though nearly absent in this film. After all this criticism I must add the acting was excellent,and the song and singing from Adele brilliant. So my thoughts are, better story, sharper more sophisticated script, and save some from the first 20 minutes for the rest of the film.",8,2,3,24 October 2015
Inglourious Basterds," Truth and aspiration
","This film is remarkable for several reasons. The first is that it does not take sides in order to glorify any one philosophy. Another is its brilliant depiction of the people who are 'good' at war, sadistic,distorted, prejudiced, brutal people, on both or even all sides of the conflict. Which seems to declare, war happens, it is wrong, and the reason it is wrong, is it attracts people who are almost caricatures of evil.But what most surprised and delighted me was Brad Pits performance, an actor I had dismissed as just a pretty boy, playing himself, with empty swagger[ a la Tom Cruise, except for collateral, brilliant ]. Even in Spy Games with Robert Redford, always masterful, he played Brad [ bad boy swagger Pit]. In this film he gave a flawless, awesome performance, albeit brutally distasteful. Close ups, vocal delivery, gestures, timing, come on Brad always get it so right.",8,2,6,30 March 2016
School of Rock," brilliant
","When I first watched this film I did not know what to expect. But was entertained and delighted by its content and spirit. My first thought was how come nothing quite like this has ever been attempted before. It had all the elements that go to make a great story,the enthusiasm of a yet to make it musician, a responsive youthful group of teenage, gifted but unrealised musicians, a controlling, misguided, but persuadable Establishment, and in the blend, the unauthorised teacher of the group nearly discredited. To top it all a contest was entered by this new group of hopefuls, and after initial resistance and disappointment, a final electric performance, gave them all the prize they deserved. There,s only one thing left to say, 'they stuck it to the man'.",10,15,15,10 June 2014
