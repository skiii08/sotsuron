The New World," Awful
","I don't know if the people voting for this film were watching something another film and got confused but this is terrible. Not much plot, action, dialogue, acting.....Nothing happens, no one says much boring. What were Colin and Christian thinking....Oh look here's another speedboat/condo/car......If your wife/girl friend/other picks this to watch, go out.......I'm struggling to write 10 linesI'll keep going just soyou knowhow bad this is",1,0,5,27 November 2006
Alien vs. Predator," A message to the studios......
","The Aliens don't look right they never have since 'ALIENS' the movie go back to the men in suites. In this case (and alien 4 oh and alien 3 whilst we're at it) the cgi aliens aren't as good as the costume aliens.This should have been an awesome film the potential for the plot was massive but the the story doesn't deliver. There isn't enough story and the film is too short, the big fight seens aren't big and there are no really strong characters.ShameLet's hope aliens 6 or predator 4 will be better (if they ever make then).My recommendation to the studios go out and hire the same team that made ALIENS because ever since then none of the series has been any good.Hey you never know it might be like that games AVP was crap but AVP2 was AWESOME :) Here's living in hope :)Plot for AVP 2???The aliens are taking over earth and the humans are loosing but the predators come to the rescue of the human's who were their former slaves. you can work some plot twists in there if you like. For example a human/some humans save the predators or something. Anyway there must be massive fight scenes with a scale like troy. Aliens running up and down buildings all over NY??? or some other large city and predators, hundreds of them engaged in fighting them all over the city/country. Massive battles :) oh year and the human space marines giving them some too :) you could just call it 'Alien 3 Earthbound' lol and forget the other crap you've made :D or call it AVP and forget the first one was ever made too JUST LIKE THE GAMES IN FACT LOL.HAVE A STRONG MALE LEAD no offense to all the women out there, Sigourney pulled it off like no one else can and this has to be one of my all time favorite characters ever but any other female actress in the role just wouldn't or for that matter couldn't match up in the lead role.......Bring back the aliens team, bring back the space marines with big fights and big guns and make my movie!!!!!!!!I'll even write the plot/story if you need some help :DBrian",4,1,2,3 September 2004
