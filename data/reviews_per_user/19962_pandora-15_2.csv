The Blair Witch Project," It was good for what it left up to the imagination.
","This was not your everyday, common horror movie....and that's what made it good. If it had shown and disclosed everything that went on (in as horrifying detail as most horror movies) it wouldn't have been scary, there would have been nothing to wonder about, no mystery. The mystery was what made it good. I'm afraid however that this is not the kind of movie for someone with no imagination, they'll just find it dumb.",7,1,1,3 September 1999
Romeo + Juliet," Well written but Leo cant handle the Iambic pentameter AT ALL!!!!
","The first time I saw this movie I thought it was GREAT.......however, I then read the play. After reading the play i saw the movie again and was disgusted. I apreciated the fact that it was the only film version to be fit into under 2 hours. Claire Danes appears to truly love the poetry however she was AWFUL at the death scene, perhaps because it was changed so that he was still alive when she awoke so the lines she had did not really make sense.  But I must say that throughout the entire thing I was physically pained by leonardo DiCaprio's performance, he clearly could not handle the language and was uncomfortable using it, I found it to be his worst performance yet and perhaps one of the most horrid Romeo's I have ever seen. Though it has a strong supporting cast, Leo's performance was enough to ruin it for me!!!",Null,0,1,2 March 2000
