Blade Runner 2049," A shining neon-glowing sequel.
","This review of Blade Runner 2049 is spoiler free ***** (5/5) WHEN RIDLEY SCOTT released the first Blade Runner back in 1982 it was unlike anything before it, it was essentially more than just a film with an impressively compelling performance from Harrison Ford, it was immediately noticed as a technological accomplishment filled to the brim with an impressive collection of special effects – the moving holographic billboards were enough to make your eyes pop, the flying cars which now are more of a fantasy than a reality and a combination humans and robots called replicants. It really achieved higher than any other sci-fi before and even after the time – which essentially is why today it goes down as a masterpiece and perhaps the best that cinema has ever been. However when French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve announced that he was going to do a sequel long time fans were sceptical about it saying that it wouldn't be as good, it would give the predecessor a bad name and won't go down as well.Emphatically now at the long-awaited release of Blade Runner 2049 you can erase your fears as this is by far the best a sci-fi sequel has ever been. We open with Ryan Gosling's Officer KD6-3.7 a Blade Runner for the Los Angeles Police Department who's on a case to bring in any old replicants while on the case he unearths a long-buried secret that has the potential to plunge what's left of society into chaos which could destroy everything they have come to know. Set in a world where the Earth is left in anarchy after an event which shook the world and brought the people of the city into fear shattering previous memories everything is left empty seemingly without repair. The film erupts from the opening reel as Villeneuve drags you into the often lonely life of Gosling's policeman who tries everything to repair his life back to the way it was, his character is complex yet cleverly thought out thanks to a script penned by Hampton Fancher and co-writer Michael Green they give his character a simple story but he's emotional too dealing with feelings way beyond his thoughts. And for any of you La La Landers out there Gosling is on top of his game much like Ford's performance in the film's predecessor he's incredible and brings a powerful dynamic to his story and essentially the film would be nothing without him.As an experience it's a must see especially in IMAX – it's loud ominous score quakes around the halls shattering your eardrums from the vibrations, the beautiful giant holographic billboards are enough to make your eyes pop just looking at the colour and the bright city lights and the sci-fi action is riveting and fast paced. Immediately after entering the live futuristic city of Los Angeles it's clear that Villeneuve is right at home here using the same directing techniques he's become accustomed with during Sicario, Prisoners or indeed Arrival using impressive close-ups, stunning long shots and eye-shattering panoramic shots. However at a runtime of 2 hours 43 minutes it's quite a long marathon that you will have to exercise for before stepping into the theatre yet that exercise is worth and is thoroughly paid off.Stylistically it is a Blade Runner film so for long-time fans the environment will be all too familiar and producer Scott who's happy to be back in this territory he makes every collection of images as real as possible bringing Villeneuve's imagination to life it really doesn't get any better than this. Happily when Ford's Rick Deckard comes onto the audience smiles from ear-to-ear. Story wise his character is a bit like Luke Skywalker from Star Wars: The Force Awakens he has been missing for thirty years and there is an extensive search for him. When found, Rick doesn't take to K at first he immediately thinks that K is trying to kill him. Here Ford now 75 years old looks a little worse for wear as if he's been lost aching for a little company which has been missing from his life and he brings this emotion into his character's grief giving him some emotional prowess which thanks to his stunning performance pays off.Happier still, the action is incredible there are only a few action scenes but each one is as brutal as the previous time round – Villeneuve introduces the action scenes as a cinematic thespian adding momentum to the white knuckle punches and a deafening ping from the two characters' blasters which surprisingly look as good as new. The action is relentless, fast-paced and utterly riveting from a wide-eyed opening fight scene with Dave Bautista's Sapper Morton, through electric chase scenes to a brutal final fight scene they are compelling and Villeneuve lets them play their toll painting a shiny gloss to the end credits. What Villeneuve has created in Blade Runner 2049 is an impressive, compelling and brilliant sci-fi sequel that shines with a glossy finish and will still look good with multiple viewings and is an experience that will last for decades to come.VERDICT: An impressive exercise of stunning colour, immersive CG images and incredible techniques Villeneuve's sequel isn't just a movie, it's a technological accomplishment, and is by far this year's best film.",10,53,123,5 October 2017
War Dogs," War is a funny business
","This is my review of War Dogs (spoiler free).*** (3/5) Cast: Jonah Hill, Miles Teller, Ana de Armas, Bradley Cooper.Plot: Two men who were best friends in high school decide to reunite and become arms dealers, but as their life they get a deal that could possibly be the best deal for them, however this deal could be a big mistake for these two.War Dogs is sold as a comedy. Yet it is the most serious adult war comedy out there. After director Todd Phillips' made an impact in the comedy world with the Hangover trilogy yes even the clunky, unfunny sequels. This is quite a challenge for him as he tries to create grown-up material without a naked Ken Jeong leaping on one of their faces. Yet he succeed with a sort of funny adult war story that has a few laughs sprouting every now and then but it is mostly serious. David Packouz (Teller, still keeping his master performance from Whiplash in play) is a man who wants more from his life rather than being a salesman of expensive Egyptian sheets and his life as a licensed masseuses, until he sees an old friend from high school Efraim Diveroli (Hill) and they get back together again. David and Efraim are now friends again and Efraim introduces him to his job and he is instantly jealous of his life. Although this feels much like the Wolf of Wall Street especially with the narration this mainly comes from David this makes the whole experience a whole lot better.As the story goes on the comedy standards get better and funnier and this also makes for fun dialogue, mainly said by the two lead characters. However the two lead actors are both ten years older than the characters they are playing yet with their riveting performances you seem to forget that. It's also filled with pretty good action although not as good as a Scorsese masterpiece but the pacing feels the same in this and the pacing is spaced out to show that the director certainly didn't rush to make this feature. There is pretty good action not much in terms of violence but mainly from the use of guns, and also the funny one liners each of the lead roles come out with. In one scene when the two friends go to Albania a country literally torn by war they have to deliver a ton of ammo in a very short time but as this goes through David has to stay there alone while, Efraim gets drunk and also he does the most sinister thing ever which will probably end their friendship, however Efraim realizes his mistake and tries to make it better, without success. There are even emotional standards in the film. Although filled with masculinity apart from the one woman Ana de Armas' Iz who is David's girlfriend but that is all the femininity that this film has to offer so mostly men. Especially with Bradley Cooper's top arms dealer Henry Girard's random outburst 'See this is why I like arms dealing - no women.' Although apart from all the funny outbursts this peace of comedy is mostly serious, with a much similar tone to Whiskey Tango Foxtrot another comedy about a war torn country and the lead role goes there to try an sort things out. So essentially based on the Hangover series and yes even the Wolf of Wall Street, this shows to be a film that is based around war time can serious and funny at the same time.Verdict: Buoyed by riveting performances and pretty action, this proves that Todd Phillips can do grown-up material without a naked Ken Jeong.6/10 Rude and laugh out loud funny.",6,4,4,27 August 2016
It," It definitely floats
","This review of IT is spoiler free**** (4/5)IT WAS THE year 1986, Benny King's chart topping hit Stand by Me had stepped back into the charts as the film as soon as the film, yet another Stephen King adaptation (adapted from The Body) was released. King had started writing his next novel the seminal 1,136 page novel IT where a small town in Maine has had a spate of child disappearances from a demon called Pennywise the Dancing Clown. Which back in 1990 was adapted into a TV mini series, when the aptly insane British actor Tim Curry played Pennywise in a terrifying, show stopping performance. And after years of waiting King Fanatics are yet again treated to a new adaptation of the novel, from Mama 's director Andy Muschietti. And as the aptly written tagline says it definitely does float.In reference to Stand By Me within the first five minutes after the introduction of the 'loser club' a bunch of kids who constantly get bullied by kids bigger than them, they communicate with banter, they curse and they pick on each other. Perhaps it's a subtle entry to another King adaptation, but it plays a major part to their story, gradually forming a sense of comedy and heart ship between them. There's drama to their story too, the leader of the group Jaeden Lieberher's 13-year-old Bill suffers a loss, his younger brother. His parents have given up. He is insistent on finding his brother he insists that he's missing somewhere. This emotion affects the other members of the group. As they start to explore the town for any evidence, they start to see Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd's Pennywise haunting their inner fears in confident form.SkarsgÃ¥rd is terrifying as Pennywise the Dancing Clown, sporting a clown face, the painted smile which goes above his deep red eyes, dressed in white baggy clothes, a catchy voice and laugh to go with it, essentially he's a friendly figure drawing in an audience at a circus. He can shape shift into the kids' inner fears from a dead child, through a narcissistic father to germs which thanks to the effects team look as real as possible. Like Godzilla or the Dinosaurs in Jurassic Park Pennywise appears in short yet terrifying spouts, which as the film progresses become scarier than the last. And thanks to SkarsgÃ¥rd's heart stopping performance it doesn't get any better than this. The child actors' performances are incredible too; they deal with drama, with fear and with the emotion that comes with it all in spades way beyond their age group. How scary is IT? You're probably asking. This seems to depend on your average horror intake threshold. Seemingly oblivious to any trends or the changes to the genre in recent years - Muschietti, seems to go with the straightforward approach to some of the horror tropes, he opts for the jump scares, the fast whipped camera pans zooming into the terrifying faces and finally the Psycho-esque strings banging and striking harshly at elements of the film. Muschietti's approach is slow; he slowly adds these jump scares each more effective than the last striking the kids' fears one take at a time. This all adds up to the film's final approach in the third act, when Pennywise shows himself for the monster he really is. The group has one final fight to get rid of the threat once and for all. And it all pays off in the end as this is perhaps the best horror film in recent years, it's terrifying, it's spooky and it's darkly entertaining as the new Pennywise may just be the best horror demon EVERÂ…VERDICT A potent, bold, and terrifying horror story which solidly manages to deal with the collection of scary, hallucinatory, ludicrous, nightmarish images from King's novel. And may just be the best King adaptation in recent years.",8,6,14,8 September 2017
Detroit," Riotously epic
","This review of Detroit is spoiler free**** (4/5)DETROIT IS PERHAPS the boldest title for writing-directing duo Mark Boal and Kathryn Bigelow's latest, re-enacting the true history of one of the darkest chapters in American history - the summer riots of 1967 in Detroit, Michigan. When forty-three people were killed, 1,200 were injured, 7,000 were arrested, 2,000 buildings were torched after a police raid on an unsuspecting African-American group which then broke out in a five-day civil rights war and it became the biggest race riot in modern history, as Motor City was left in a smoking husk. Sure, Zero Dark Thirty was intense but this is perhaps Bigelow's most gripping film to date depicting real images of torture and a brutal re-enactment of the famous Algiers Motel war, in compelling form.Over the last few years Bigelow has proved that she is the master director behind time bomb cinema from action, Point Break to its tick-tocking rhythm with Strange Days and The Hurt Locker. This kind of filmmaking proves to be no stranger here as her latest erupts from the opening reel. After a timely scattering of news archive footage, you're plunged into a fiery recreation of history. As the city's people congregate in the dark streets, anger ensues as objects are thrown, gun shots are heard and a volcano of smoke flying into the air. Bigelow effectively introduces her different perspectives; firstly there's Will Poulter's introduction shot and chase at a rioter, secondly Larry (Algee Smith) the lead singer of a Motown group, third is Greene (Anthony Mackie) a Vietnam War veteran and lastly there's John Boyega's young convenience store guard Melvin Dismukes. The riot is into its third day when these perspectives converge in the Algiers Motel – used as a refugee camp for those who want to get away from the burning streets, perhaps in a hideous twist of irony, becoming the dark backdrop of the brewing massacre about to erupt. There are bullets coming through the walls, in an attempt for the police to track down a sniper. The motel is raided – violence, terrorisation and torture initiate as people are tied against the wall in a vicious interrogation section led by Krauss who does anything to get information from the guests in the motel.Graphically recreated in real-time it's an hour-long section which you will remember for days, perhaps weeks or maybe decades it's enough to make you shudder. Bigelow's directing isn't exactly easy on the eyes either, it's sometimes gruelling as men and women are tortured for information, they're beaten and constantly threatened by the police in the building, it's nightmarish too, the deafening gun shots are enough to haunt you. However it's always on edge, always moving and a gripping almost real-life re-enactment of modern history. This is closest to the horror of Near Dark, were as that's fantasy the horror of Detroit has a sickening flash of reality. Backed up by Boal's tremendously researched screenplay it pulls all punches. Filled with brutal, yet stunning imagery of events gone by, deafening shouting from the police which fills the entire bleak atmosphere of the motel and phenomenal performance as all players are on top form. As the night of torture erupts around the building – its Bigelow's casting of Poulter that shines here, he's unflinching, unhinged, and unchained as you wouldn't expect beneath his baby faced demeanour is something vicious, yet in every moment he's fantastic.After this gruelling, yet breathtaking center-piece the film sighs for a breath of fresh air when the third act rolls in. As the city-wide riot comes to a hasty close there are many court cases involving the police, news stories and a chance to re-build the burning city skyline. Inevitably, this falls short of perfection, granted it's a well-made section filled with Boal's exceptional writing, flawless performances, and Bigelow's incredible hand in direction but it's often left gasping for air. Still, this is an utterly compelling riot epic that's always moving and will effortlessly stay with you well after the credits end.VERDICT Gruelling, nightmarish, yet always an utterly compelling and moving riot epic thriller one that expertly and unflinchingly recreates one of the darkest chapters in American history.",8,2,8,25 August 2017
Wind River," Hawkeye hits the spot.
","This review of Wind River is spoiler free**** (4/5)TAYLOR SHERIDAN HAS two sides, one is the well praised Oscar nominated writer of Sicario and Hell or High Water, two highly successful crime capers which succeeded in presenting grim images of an America that doesn't exist anymore, if it ever did just from his words. Which were then transferred on screen by Denis Villeneuve and David Mackenzie. The second is a director which leads us to his 'proper' debut - shiftily erasing 2011s torture porn feature Vile from his CV. Wind River. A brutal story of a murder that happens on the Wind River Reservation Park in the mountainous regions of Wyoming. With it he proves that he is one of the best storytellers of our time...The opening is striking: Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) a veteran game tracker at the reservation stumbles across the body of a dead girl, he teams up with Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) an FBI agent who's not used to cold weather who helps him solve the case. Here Sheridan switches the tone to a whodunit thriller, the duo go around town to ask questions, who could be the suspect? Why this girl? What happened to her? The mysteries pile up, and Sheridan deals with each of them one step at a time picking a route to go with and gradually adding up clues. Sheridan's main focus is on the Native American community of the town - that's not a negative, if anything it's a positive, throughout he brutally enforces the message that anyone can be the target for murder. He gives it the human approach, his script deals with depression, there's a moment of a mother cutting herself while flooded in tears, and an upset father who wants this case solved quickly. Cory's story is a powerful one too, in the field he essentially strikes you as a Sherlock in the snow. On the inside he's just suffered a divorce from his ex-wife so he has to look after his young son, but there is a larger hole in his heart, a powerful message which Renner's emotional performance helps to convey. A performance that's evenly matched by Olsen, her's is a flawed yet powerful character, as the only major authority figure out there she must get used to the snowy setting if she wants to understand the clues in front of her, but as the evidence piles up she goes in for the kill.Meanwhile, like Sicario and Hell or High Water he succeeds in making a use of the beautiful wide open sprawls of the snowy forests and the haunting quiet of the wild. Keeping the triple threat of the brutality, the bleakness and the darkness. Sadly, Wind River is not without its flaws, it suffers from American despair, it's less inner city, more inner wilderness and sometimes the film suffers from that. Despite that, this is a wildly enchanting, heartfelt and confident debut which keeps the thrills tight and thoroughly engaging. VERDICT Sheridan's debut is a heartfelt, moving and compelling crime thriller which erupts right from the opening reel, filled with excellent performances and non-stop thrills.",8,0,2,7 September 2017
Train to Busan," Train of horror
","This is my review of Train to Busan (spoiler free)**** (4/5)AFTER SEVERAL YEARS of the boring, brooding and sort of manipulative over pretentious plotting on The Walking Dead over the last couple of seasons adding some lazy new characters and even lazier walkers, in addition to that the lazy, inept copycats with a lot of action but not enough story or character depth the zombie sub-genre has felt a little bit tired and somewhat overused at points; it needed a breath of fresh air to come back to life thankfully one man writer/director live-action debutant Yeon Sang-ho's Train to Busan brings the fresh air that the sub-genre sorely needed and does it in style. The story is simple and very straightforward as the film opens with Seok woo (Gong Yoo) a man with a workaholic lifestyle as a hedge fund manager and is always absent from his precocious young daughter Soo-an (Kim Soo-an), the two then take a train from their home in Seoul to Busan, at the bottom end of the country but as a suspicious passenger boards the train and what started out as a general commute turns into a train of horrors, as most of the passengers turn into a mass horde of ravenous flesh-eating crazies and the survivors have to survive the vicious attack and outrun the infected to survive.It may sound like a general zombie film with a very familiar premise but the good story and clever plot adds a lot of tension, a masquerade of zombies and high-octane action that refuses to take a break but when it does the film adds in a lot of drama and character depth to points where it's needed. For its length at a total of 118 minutes it is a bit longer than most traditional films of this genre but the pacing of the story is astonishing as for the first 45 minutes it teases the audience with a lot of memorable zombies, action and some terrific heartfelt and harrowing drama that's unpretentious fun. Instead of meeting traditional standards of other zombie subgenres and killing off some new characters as soon as they are introduced as shown in Cell earlier this year this goes with introducing new and important character that are instantly lovable. Two of these characters we meet very early on, a man Song Hwa (Ma Dong-seok) who doesn't take to Seok as soon as he meets him because he thinks that he is just a rich business man who doesn't care for anybody but himself, and his young pregnant wife Sung Gyeong (Jeong Yu-mi), who falls in love with Seok's daughter straightaway. These two characters are instantly lovable and add a lot of drama to the story where it's needed. Though for some parts Song has to put up with Seok and even has to fight through some of the horde in a scene when they are both heading towards a car to find Seok's daughter they have to fight through some of the zombies, however they find out that they can't see in the dark – it's a very enjoyable concept to story that is both action packed and inventive genius as there has other no other film with that kind of intuitive genius. At one point in the second act the train has a stop at Daejeon station and it all seems fine to that passengers and looks like it hasn't been infected but the passengers get attacked by the fast infected, but how fast are they? Imagine Usain Bolt on steroids; that fast. However the survivors don't have guns to defend themselves from the infected which is another enjoyable additional genius to the story as there are far too many zombie sub-genre films that rely on guns for defense, this should be a lesson for Hollywood to take in that guns aren't always a good thing. Although the film isn't flawless not by a long way as the infected are strung together by heavy amounts of CG rubber no, it's not a sequel to World War Z, there is also an elderly man who tries to block Seok and some other survivors out of the rest of the train tries saying that they are infected he's more loud than good and there are zombies that don't die from falling out of a window.The third act is the most dramatic as it offers some heavily impacting heartfelt drama that is guaranteed to make even the most cynical person roll in flood of tears as the train reaches its final descent towards its destination there are some heartbreaking deaths with some of the more lovable characters that leads to an ending which could see a sequel being made that has already been announced. Aside from familiar premise with World War Z and 28 Days Later and the length of the story this is a brilliant, ingenious, and terrifying zombie film that adds a lot of tension with lovable in-depth characters giving brilliant performances, director Yeon Sang-ho's no nonsense story never ceases to deliver and it proves to be just as biting as Bong Joon-ho's dystopian sc-fi thriller Snowpiercer this original story is a breath of fresh air that is better than other Hollywood films of this sub-genre, so we can all breathe again. In short, the zombie sub-genre is back to its best and in terrific style as this could easily one of the best zombie films ever.VERDICT: A purely terrifying, original and no nonsense roller-coaster ride filled with fast paced high-octane action, memorable zombies and harrowing emotion that refuses to stop as it delivers a lot of bite; easily one of the best ever zombie films.8/10 Brilliant.",8,7,16,28 October 2016
Darkest Hour," Spreads light around darkness
","This review of Darkest Hour is spoiler free**** (4/5)WINSTON CHURCHILL ISN'T just a historical figure at the top of Britain's governmental power during war time, he's also a man with character, this character, though sometimes tipped by his fundamental anger issues, is often cherishable and warm-hearted. Director Joe Wright with his latest Darkest Hour exposes his warmth to the nth degree, a heavy package that entirely offers hands up to his leading man Gary Oldman. An actor who has impressed us for many decades with chameleonic methods through his performances, his emotive heft to carry a story, despite this work through the years, has astonishingly been rewarded with only a single Oscar nomination (earned after Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy). And if his performance here can't change that, then perhaps nothing will, which unfortunately will be forever his shame because Churchill is a gift of a role and with Wright he truly gives the performance of his life. 
 
Of course from first glance you simply have to credit the way he pulls off the infamous Churchill features. The sensational make-up work courtesy of Kazuhiro Tsuji who smoothly complements him rather than smothers him, the make-up artist gives his purest attention to the detail as every spot, every mole, even the circular spectacles, and the unique bowler hat coming complete with a cigar in hand. The effects on show here are something to cherish indeed, though that's just his detail...for the rest you have to hand it to Wright, who succeeds as both a virtuoso filmmaker (images of raiding German bombers don't go without a mention) and a natural designer paying exquisite detail to the period setting and looks stunning while doing so thanks to Bruno Delbonnel's brilliant cinematography. 
 
Oldman also eloquently shows the frailty of Churchill, sweat on his brow from the stress of war, the speeches which he dictates to his secretary (Lily James), keen advice from Ben Mendelsohn's Kingly figure and finally the stress of putting up with one of his advisers (a stern Stephen Dillane, looking greyer than usual). His power in government is at a turbulent time, he sees that he's not much liked among the people he shares his work with. Members of the public see him as a valuable figure for moral in moments of war. Which not only is this seen as Oldman's evidence of dynamism and flexibility as an actor, it shows him as a reliable force not to be reckoned with. Happily it's not just a one man show. Kristin Scott Thomas is brilliant as his wife Clementine Churchill, with her in the picture he knows he can go to her for a friendly hand of guidance when he's at his most stressed and most of the time he is, his temper can rise quite easily whenever he's angry at any of his advisers. Of course, she gets excellent support too, by Mendelsohn's King George VI, Dillane's Viscount Halifax, James' secretary Elizabeth Layton. However the script by Anthony McCarten (The Theory of Everything) often struggles to integrate some of the female participants into male-dominated '40s Westminster, but Oldman offers just enough power to withstand through the lacking female narrative. 
 
For his stature in polished filmmaking of a bygone era, Wright too gains praise as here he returns to the style where he's strongest. Much like his previous venture into the past, Atonement which was set around the same time: the climactic evacuation of Dunkirk (furthered in Nolan's summer hit). In short, Darkest Hour is a gripping British political drama filled with astonishing performances and one which flawlessly brings history back to life. 'V for Victory' at the Oscars? Quite Possibly. 
 
VERDICT Oldman brings Churchill to life with his fiercest performance ever in this gripping, and touching drama which visually transports you into the past.",8,0,3,12 January 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," The force is with us, we are one with the force
","This review of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is spoiler free **** (4/5)In order to create a prequel of the Star Wars franchise especially in the post era of George Lucas, the director who makes it would need to have serious Death Star-sized balls in order to do it well. Ultimately it seems that, that isn't the problem for director Gareth Edwards whom since his stunningly assured debut 2010s Monster and a few years later creating yet another monster movie Godzilla, he has changed the era of modern film with each of them looking dizzying while this happens. Although Rogue One: A Star Wars Story isn't close to a monster which is the atmosphere that the director is used to. Though this isn't any ordinary Star Wars film as it doesn't have any lightsabres, it's all done practically using blasters during the dynamic fight scenes. It's essentially a war film which is set in space, but it looks dazzling while doing it as each blaster shot emits a bright light right across the big screen. The story is done well with each character although increasingly clever are all very dynamic who do well to keep their part in the story which at some points erupts over them, each scene during the first second and even the third act which will make every single Star Wars geek tremble with excitement.Though not all the credit can be given to a very ambitious Gareth Edwards, as some of the of the credit can be given to John Knoll the leader of Edwards' effects team who is also a veteran employee of IML (Industry of Magic & Light) as he tries to implement the same special effects of the 1977 classic A New Hope, but it looks brilliant as the message is clear here that the special effects from nearly 40 years ago are still relevant even now. But also some other credit points have to be given to the screenwriter Tony Gilroy, who formed a clever script that can possibly go down as a classic Star Wars script, as each player are given some while fun, but also some very serious dialogue but is still rather quick on its wits and quick on its whims with some of the more dynamic characters. Each character plays their part well, delivering some brilliant funny one liners but also doing their part to fight the oncoming threat of the overreaching Imperial Forces who still can't aim straight. Even though there are no lightsabres it seems there is still much to enjoy in this origin story. Also to keep the story from strafing too far into the generics of the previous Star Wars prequels, there is a large seven foot tall, black, white and orange re-programmed Imperial droid K-2SO (voiced by the always charismatic Alan Tudyk) who says some of the funnier lines in which sense could be seen as the new C-3PO, what's not like? At points, the film is a lot darker but earnest as it seems that like Luke Skywalker and Rey, our heroine in this film Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) also has a very dark past but unlike Luke and Rey who constantly try to hide Jyn, constantly has memories of her past with her father Galen (Mads Mikkeslen), who at this point was being taken over by the director of the Imperial Forces Director Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn). So to take her mind off her dark past, she must form with the Rebel Alliance who together form an almost Mission: Impossible style mission to find the construction plans for the Empire's most dangerous weapon the Death Star, yes you thought you saw enough of the ominous grey and black space station, well it seems we have to see it one last time. But don't let that put you off as the weapon looks exactly the same as it did in the 1977 classic, ominous and creepy so really it's exactly the same as other Star Wars movies at this point. The Rebel Alliance are constantly at risk of being destroyed throughout the galaxy so they must have one massive fight against the ever growing Empire, this is when the film looks its best with each shot of the camera moving in to show each shot of the blasters without the look of a J.J Abrams-esque lens flare taking over each inch of the screen.At other points the battle scenes maybe dynamic but they feel a little long but that isn't the problem as when this happens you can always rely on K-2SO saying another increasingly funny line, although the final battle does take quite a while it looks very dazzling with John Knoll's special effects doing well at making the film look gorgeous, with Gareth Edwards' transitions and camera movements implementing a sort of documentary verite style with a mash up of close-ups and far away shots, but also there are points when this takes place in the cold ominous skies of space but again it looks spectacular, as the final battle not only takes place on the Empire's outpost but also in the depths of space with other Rebel Ships. But also like the title suggests it does go quite rogue on the plans but not so rogue that it loses the plot. It seems that the Star Wars universe can still keep going as it now has an elaborate and very beautiful origin story to show how it really began with the final act that will make every Star Wars geek cheer and applaud with glee.VERDICT: More dark and more grown up than the other Star Wars films, but its quick on its wits and quick on its whims, it seems that this universe will still be here for years to come.8/10 visceral experience.",8,1,6,15 December 2016
The Danish Girl," Life's Changes
","This is my review of The Danish Girl (spoiler free).Cast: Academy Award winner Eddie Redmayne*, Academy Award nominee Alicia Vikander** and Ben Whishaw.Plot: Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne) and his wife Gerda Wegener (Alicia Vikander) are both painters trying to find their way in the world, but when Einar figures out who he really is he then goes through difficult but life changing choices.This film is a biography set in Copenhagen, Denmark in the 1920s and takes place over a few months with husband and wife Einar and Gerda Wegener, this film will make you laugh and also make you cry because of the difficult changes being made throughout. Let me go through some points on why I think this film is good:Performances: The performances in this film were exceptional and might I even say Oscar-worthy, when the film you don't see them even stutter a single and it looks they understood their roles very. Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander's performances were the ones that shone the brightest.Scripting: This is a minor point the script was good but it could have been better there were few missing lines I felt and a plot hole, wasn't big but but you know it's there but other than that pretty good.Costume Design: The costume design really set the tone for the film the costumes were made as if taken from the 1920s. It's as if I felt like I was in the 1920s (specifically 1926) the costume designer made for the clothing.All in all I think this is a really good and well performed period drama that could really make an impact at the awards this year. 8/10 a must watch.* Best performance by a leading Actor, Eddie Redmayne (The Theory of Everything, 2014), ** Best performance by a leading actress, Alicia Vikander (The Danish Girl, 2015).",8,0,1,14 January 2016

",This film based on true story was filmed Danny Boyle the guy who gave us Trainspotting and 28 Days Later. James Franco plays Aron Ralston who is a climber and takes place between 26th April-1st May 2003. This film is literally exhilarating and tear jerking this film literally made me cry and it is one of the most amazing films I have ever seen in about 4 years.The story of this film is just outstanding and matches the genre very well the acting from James Franco is perfect why did he not win best actor for this role that he played just really well.We know that Danny Boyle makes very films 28 Days Later being one of my favorites because he makes great stories and is just wonderful with a camera.I recommend this film to anyone because it is just wonderful deserves all the Oscars it was nominated for.,8,0,0,21 November 2014
Thor: Ragnarok," Bring The Thunder
","This review of Thor: Ragnarok is spoiler free**** (4/5)LIKE CHANTING BETELGUISE'S name, for Marvel products the phrase third time's a charm really works, of course well-earned nods to brother directors Anthony and Joe Russo's Captain America: Civil War which accomplished all fears for its enchanting, eye-shattering Leipzig airport battle scene having the heroes involved showing what they can do, the standout there was Black Panther and the introduction of the newer, younger much improved Spider-Man. Then we had Shane Black's turn at Iron Man 3 which vastly improved on its predecessor. Now the third and final entry in the Thor series is one of the most ridiculous, most hilarious adventures Marvel has ever produced, it's essentially like eating a badger sandwich, and no we don't know what that is either. This daftness comes from none other than New Zealand-born director Taika Waititi, who over the last few years has created some of the most bizarre adventures ever told in cinema with his hilarious vampire-mockumentary What We Do In The Shadows and secondly Hunt For The Wilderpeople which had a stunning performance from Sam Neill in a hat made from a collinder. However Thor: Ragnarok is his most ridiculous adventure yet.After Chris Hemsworth's Thor is hurled from the bifrost he's captured on a strange planet which from first glance is obviously the universe's trash can, under the rule of Jeff Goldblum's daft, yet tyrannical Grandmaster who looks like he just wears anything he finds in the 80s factory complete with a blue line under his lip and comes with a lot of Goldbluminess, he's funny as hell - he gives Thor the ultimate fight against his champion - Hulk's (Mark Ruffalo) welcome is really no surprise but comes with a roundhouse of applause particularly with the well-drawn hand-to-hand combat in a Star Wars-esque gladiatorial coliseum which can't escape Thor's scream of joy and a few quick-witted jokes to get you going. Meanwhile on the other side of the universe the Asghardians are held for a fight for their survival after a vicious attack from Cate Blanchett's goddess of death Hela looking a tad like Alice Cooper's twisted sister complete with a horned helmet for ferocity. Sadly her performance is the film's weakest point, she doesn't exactly come with Galadriel's strength or depth she's not Marvel's best villain, though a better improvement over Thor: The Dark World's Dark Elves. She's not in many scenes and when she does appear her delivery is often heavy-handed and empty with little feeling.The script penned by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost is an improvement over the previous instalment too - the funnier scenes are along the same lines as James Gunn's unadulterated joy for Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2, here there are arse gags and penis gags aplenty which is a vast improvement over the previous two films' barrier for serious face the actors are allowed to let loose here. Particularly the shared chemistry between Thor who hates having his hair cut, Hulk angry as ever and Tessa Thompson's surly Valkyrie who can't stop drinking yet comes with a humanizing story giving her performance some emotion. Yet there's humour to them too they each share their time with the whims and the jokes that the script has to offer, the three arguing in a room with an angry Hulk and a teamed final fight are obvious standouts. Sadly, Thor: Ragnarok doesn't come without its flaws it's not utterly thunderous throughout the last few minutes of the final fight are a little CG heavy there's a lot going on in a few shots it can be difficult to follow a certain point which watching in 3D can be on occasion daunting to the eyes. Though there is some goodness the CG images on show, here the destruction of Asghard though upsetting for the fans who have stayed with the series is thoroughly stunning plus this is the most impressive vision of Hulk yet, he's still a wonder to watch from the outrageous gladiatorial combat, through the hilarious jokes he lets free to the film's final fight he's relentless and utterly charming. This is vintage Waititi he is clearly at home here in the huge immersive worlds of space or the cramped space of Hulk's chamber he allows you to breathe with the world he has created here. The finale of the Thor series is one of the most intense, boldest adventures Marvel has ever created does it bring on the thunder? You're damn right it does.VERDICT Daft, ridiculous and hilarious Waititi manages to retain his unique brand of humour and goofball madness in this neon-infused 80s style finale.",8,51,91,24 October 2017
Ready Player One," Get Ready, Player One
","This review of Ready Player One only has minor spoilers**** (4/5)THERE'S A T-REX in Ready Player One, there's a DeLorean (that doesn't go back in time) and there's a giant King Kong wrecking havoc. Over the years Steven Spielberg has been called many names; auteur, master filmmaker, highly imaginative and cinematic master, yet if there's one name applies to more it's 'Big Kid' and with his latest nerd-fest that title is fairly apt. His latest, based entirely on Ernest Cline's best selling novel of the same name, the film comes chock full of special effects, blistering colour and finally it comes clogged with pop culture references aplenty, think you know them? Well, Spielberg will challenge your knowledge in his geekiest, his most fun, most exciting and his most explosive film in recent years.We open with Wade (Sheridan), an 18-year-old lad who lives in a slum of Columbus, Ohio a place called The Stacks, a place where trailers are stacked high sat on metal stilts, to get away from this life he spends most of his time in the OASIS, a world where you can be literally anyone, change your facial features, your gender and even your lifestyle, and it's here when Spielberg's film finds it's full breathing room. It's a world filled with vibrant colour, incredible avatars of different sizes, and the real game changer they make up the shape of gaming and movie references. Here Spielberg unlocks his true nerd, and some of his most exciting directing in recent years. For example, there's a moment, not too long into the film where hundreds of cars, the DeLorean, the A-Team van and the Plymouth Fury (which happens to be driven by Lara Croft) are all racing each other through the streets of New York, having already outmaneuvered the Jurassic Park T-Rex, King Kong swings into view and as the angry giant ape appears. It's clear that all your lingering are dispelled - clearly Spielberg is going to deliver on his action-packed ride as promised. And he's right; this is by far his most exciting, his most spellbinding and his most explosive film in recent years. What follows after is a high-octane, action-packed thrill-ride that is sure to unlock your inner nerd, so get ready, player one. Meanwhile on the outside world, there's the human players, Wade and his gaming partner Samantha (Cooke) have to outrun a big corporate gaming company IOI (who's logo looks a lot like binary from a distance) and their head boss, the ruthless Nolan Sorento (Mendelsohn) who tries to find the Easter Eggs before everybody else, thus leaving OASIS under threat from being taken over. It's a high-risk contest, then, chasing the Easter Eggs announced by the recently deceased James Halliday (Rylance), the curator of the world. And Spielberg seamlessly melds the fast-paced action between the virtual world, and the real world with dazzling aplomb, melding the peril in both states and upping the stakes once we quickly approach the endgame. However Ready Player One isn't perfect as the film occasionally gets sidetracked by exposition (this is what an 'Easter Egg' is, here's why the Atari 2600 game Adventure is being used) which is only momentarily frustrating, but the real problem is with Mendelsohn, who again does too little to make any differences between Sorento, as he's also a lot like Rogue One's Orson Krennic and The Dark Knight's John Daggett. But, thankfully Spielberg's latest is mostly a joy, for Spielberg letting loose his kind of blockbuster techniques that gave him his name in the first place. And it happily shows that he can still do action-packed sequences like nobody else, clearly, he's back on top of his game. VERDICT Spielberg has done the impossible; making a virtual world feel real, in his geekiest, his most exciting and his most enchanting film in recent years; it's a pure cinematic pleasure. So get ready, player one.",8,0,3,29 March 2018
"I, Tonya"," Axel folly
","This review of I, Tonya is spoiler free**** (4/5)IN JANUARY 1994 - Tonya Harding famous for being the first American woman to complete the most difficult trick in Figure Skating this gained her a reputation as an adored sports-woman she literally had the world at her heels (or in this case her blades). However it wasn't long until she became infamous for an alleged attack on her rival Nancy Kerrigan. So more often than not she's remembered not only as having a dislikened attitude towards the pompous judges and sometimes against the audience - also she's remembered for the attack on her rival which not only got her banned from all future Olympic events but she was also forced to retire from skating in general. And, I, Tonya is more than capable of showing her life. 
 
We start with Tonya as a child played by Gifted's Mckenna Grace already forced into the world of figure skating only a few years before by the rule of her overbearing mother LeVona Harding (Allison Janney), Grace pulls a terrific performance as the already tortured child who starts to gain a bad attitude especially towards her dance teacher (Julianne Nicholson) - behind that though is a young skater who's ambitions are high, competing at a high level she quickly becomes a world-renowned athlete. On the ice she's dedicated to winning a life that's better than her own; at home she's tortured by her mother who sees it as a way to get her to become a champion. Then we skip to her teenage years - now it's Margot Robbie to take the reins - on the verge of gaining world fame after competing in championships, she finds a chance to escape from her tortured life at home and get away from her mother when she meets Sebastian Stan's Jeff Gilooly, but even after that moment when she feels better for the escape life doesn't entirely get better for her - not totally away from the abuse - it seems that the ice is her true home, she's utterly relentless thanks to a few action scenes that are fast-paced, well-timed and beautifully shot. But that's only the bare essentials; you have to credit the performances too. 
 
As Tonya, Robbie impresses, entirely capped in ugly wigs, completely stunning through visceral action scenes, complete with the attitude to be fair if you were to essentially rank her performance on a scale, it would very different from playing Leonardo DiCaprio's wife in Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street, however her performance here is almost the same as the pure insanity of Harley Quinn - from her attitude on the ice, through the arguments with her husband, to the back-chilling Harley Quinn stare which is enough to make your skin tingle from head to toe. So despite her popularity in Hollywood she's not exactly a poor choice here. 
 
Her performance is more than a match for her co-star Allison Janney, as a woman who's not only a keen supporter of her daughter (in her own way) she succeeds as the vicious woman, the result here is even scarily close to the real person, complete with the gold faux fur coat, the bird on her shoulder and the wire of an oxygen tank snaking through her room up to her nose after years of smoking. As a performer Janney has had that streak of cruelty in her roles, but she's also had a nice side to her - not entirely on show her but that's what makes her performance so good (definitely earning her first Golden Globe win). 
 
There's only one criticism with I, Tonya, sadly the action scenes aren't as visceral as they should've been, granted they're fast paced but they fail to a noticeable rubbery CG of Robbie's face plastered over the face of a stunt double. Also the film sometimes gets distracted from winding road of Tonya's making it difficult to get into the underbelly of her turbulant life. Yet still the film is consistently gripping, darkly funny, and utterly relentless, ultimately convincing the audience her tale of trial by media, but Gillespie's directing through the dark winding road into sort of Goodfellas type territory, the stunning performances may perhaps ask you to reconsider. Changing her from the villain to the heroine, but really, what's so wrong with that? VERDICT Robbie and Janney give gold medal winning performances through darkly hilarious storytelling, if you only watch one biopic this year - make it this one.",8,1,1,23 February 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Web swinging fun
","This review of Spider-man: Homecoming is spoiler free**** (4/5)SPIDER-MAN MUCH like his other superhero friends in the Marvel Universe has been through many changes over the years, he's been Spectacular in a comic book series that cleverly titled The Spectacular Spider-man, in film starting in 2002 starring Tobey McGuire he was the ordinary web head with a fun origin story. He was called amazing in 2011 when Andrew Garfield played him in the first rebooted series, and finally even his second rebooted appearance in last year's Captain America: Civil War though short was in a word; incredible. Yes the ultra famous crime fighting spider has been through a lot.In the latest reboot solo film he's back again with new blood Tom Holland, set several months after he fought alongside Iron Man in that infamous airport battle. Disappointed that a new reboot has appeared so soon? Well, don't be, this is the best Spider-man entry since 2004's Spider-man 2. Plus unlike the previous reboot, this isn't an origin story of Peter being bitten by a spider then gaining the powers. This is an origin story of him turning from Spider Boy to him becoming the Spider Man. It turns out that life for him isn't easy as fifteen-year-old Peter Parker is currently trying to balance his normal life as a high schooler, meanwhile fighting crime as his superhero alter ego Spider-man as a new threat...The Vulture (Keaton) emerges. This terrifying villainous bastard is complete with a furry coat, night vision gear and metallic eagle-like wings attached to a jet engine - he's terrifying. Keaton is fantastic as this evil big beard, who terrorises New York with his clan of criminals carrying alien-like weapons. It's up to Spider-man to swing in and stop him; however he soon finds that this battle is no match for him. Keaton somehow gets a kick out of playing scary birds, as either Batman or Birdman. Here his eyes twinkle every time he appears on screen; he shows that he's a man enjoying his late career.Holland's performance is fantastic, he shows to be the best choice here he's energetic, he's heroic and he's; well, hilarious, as Spider-man. As Peter it's a pretty stable match, the film uses him to his full potential as he tries to balance his, from his eccentric best friend (Jacob Batalon), his love life (Laura Harrier).His new mentor Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is the solemn adviser, and he teaches Peter that being a hero isn't as spectacular as he thinks. New director Jon Watts who also showed strength with his pretty good cop thriller Cop Car. He makes this the most promising web head film in years, his direction of the youngsters involved is brilliant, and his handling of the veterans such as Robert Downey Jr. and Michael Keaton is wonderfully adept. The family values here are somewhat left in the background, in the previous entries more notably the original trilogy his trusted Aunt May was used as his go to person for advice. Here she's barely used for this, though she teaches a couple of things, its Tony who gets the most interest. Which is essentially the film's main flaw. Still, the web head swings with clarity, his new suit is spectacular and his hero abilities could not be better done, this is the best he has ever looked. Spider-man: Homecoming is sweet, witty and fast moving fun. VERDICT: He's back and he's better than ever. Swinging with joy in this spectacular most polished reboot, which is filled with fantastic and witty, web swinging fun.",8,1,10,5 July 2017
Suicide Squad," Welcome to the Injustice League
","This is my review for Suicide Squad (spoiler free)****(4/5) A lot of people said that End of Watch (2013) writer/director David Ayer was crazy but nobody thought he was this crazy but here it is the craziest superhero/villain movie in existence. Which is a strong and stern addition to the DCEU, and it doesn't take itself too seriously unlike BvS which pretty much just had special effects pizazz to get it's point across, and didn't have any funny dialogue unlike this. Even though in some areas the dialogue is a bit bumpy and could have been better but all is forgiven. Because from the trailer which was released earlier this year and is one of the most viewed trailers on Youtube for movies 2016, it showed that this blockbuster is going to brilliantly bonkers and it is but not too bonkers it still has some serious bits. Which is better than BvS which made people feel more fatigued than there were enjoying it. But enough about that.The story is somewhat okay in this, you can tell it's there but it does fall flat for a few instances and alongside the plot it has the craziness that this Machiavellian crew all have in common. But with the editing it's a little faster due to the executive producer Zach Snyder it's a little darker than normal but that's not to say that, that is a bad thing it just makes the film a bit more serious which is one thing the Suicide Squad shouldn't be especially because in the comics the characters were all nuts, with the insane Harley Quinn as the leader. The characters in this are amazing you can tell that they are taken straight out of the comic book, even with Jared Leto's Joker who isn't part of the Suicide Squad comics just shows to be a formidable force along with the ride. His Joker is brilliant but lacks on thing and that is the purple attire the Joker is famous for but he does rock the 'Damaged' tattoos, also he lacks the insanity of previous Jokers but that's not his fault he still adds a certain efficiency to the story, and at some points makes it better.But the show-runner is Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn who looks astonishing in the characters skimpy clothes, and she certainly shows the craziness of the real Harley Quinn straight out of the comic and her one-liners are just hysterical, and one of a kind. However when it comes to the action they all have their special trademark attacks but the one that shows strongest is Will Smith's Deadshot proving to be a better shooter than we last lead to believe he keeps the team strong even when some (Harley Quinn) have their crazy moments. Aside from all the fast-paced action which is amazing by the way it has very good special effects which look absolutely astonishing to match with the purple and green title screen and well it certainly is a strong point of the film. Also one quick thing to add Viola Davis nails her part as secretary Amanda Waller.But on the low side it lacks the origin stories of the characters, the stories are there but they aren't as prominent as I'd hoped, and also they don't last too long and also it looks like the film just cares about the two crazy mains, who are funny which proves that David Ayer can do comedy but it looks like they take the lead way too, the other characters do make an impact though they're left standing like statues. In conclusion even without the stories this is a strong and stern addition to the DCEU and will go down in history as one of the craziest but great DC films. And certainly is better looking and makes you show your sense of humor which is one thing that Zach Snyder lacks.Verdict: A brilliantly bonkers addition to the DCEU filled with enigmatic action and crazy parts that will make even the calmest mind go crazy. Welcome to the Injustice League.8/10 full of energy and action.",4,20,40,5 August 2016

Doctor Strange," Strange world
","This is my review of Doctor Strange (spoiler free) **** (4/5) SINCE 2014s GUARDIANS of the Galaxy stomped all over the box-office with it's over $800 million boot and Ant-Man repeating the same process a year later, the Marvel Cinematic Universe have developed quite a knack for bringing to life virtually unknown origin stories in quite a spectacular fashion and that brilliant record shows that Doctor Strange will be no exception. However it may be the weirdest and strangest addition but by no means it is nonetheless an enjoyable addition as this cognitive story offers manipulative sorcery, clever screenplay, mind-melting action and mind-bending CGI it's fair to say that this will not be forgotten anytime soon. Get the thought out of your head that you never could see Benedict Cumberbatch in a cape, as he pulls it off so well along with that and the glorious devil look-a-like goatee that it looks like he was born to play this role and his brilliant performance shows it. The whole concept here is that this was strange from day one and the story written and directed by long time fan and look-a-like Scott Derrickson using his own vision this origin story is brilliant, and to put it lightly mind-blowing and is certainly a vast improvement over his last feature Deliver Us From Evil his vision and his screenplay are very clever and cognitive as the screenplay alone will manipulate the mind. In terms of the CGI picture the sorcery of Harry Potter meets the clever screenplay and the reality defying, world building dream worlds of Inception and imagine if those two joined forces and had a baby, well Doctor Strange is that baby weird concept but that's this in a bag. It may surprise you to know that the insanity that is this movie starts out ordinary with Dr. Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) working his normal shift as a show off neurosurgeon in a hospital along with his colleague/life partner Dr. Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams), until he is the victim of a terrible car crash (might this be a lesson to never text and drive) and shatters almost every nerve in his hand and has to undergo several procedures in order to get better. Until he finds an elegant solution which is nicely done in this addition he has to go to the stunning Nepal near the Himalaya mountain range and has to learn the path to power and the kind of responsibilities it holds. However at some points he almost gives up on life and sees no more strength to learn but continues on. Naturally some origin stories of this style are terribly rushed and get to the action rather quickly and although at some points this does take a while to settle but with the clever screenplay and brilliant time bending and world building powers it's set out rather well, granted there are a couple of times when some of the scenes are just stuck together and some take a while to get with the story but who cares when the final result and the final battle are so eye achingly impressive, filled with a kaleidoscope of building splits, moving floors and also a levitating cape it's almost as if he stepped into a dream world but as the story goes on he realizes that its all too real. It's quite the spectacle.The first act is used to just settling into the story and introducing the many characters played by big international players, and also training with magic which is done in a very intriguing way as the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) shows him the powers of the mind and he looks very impressed as he has gone from a none believer to becoming a learner – this scene is both inventive and has a colourful kaleidoscope which looks amazing in 3D. The second and third acts are when the world literally turns upside down for Doctor Strange as he has to face Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) and a great and powerful entity that he serves but he learns that his power is stronger than he thinks. Interestingly Kaecilius gives Doctor Strange some advice and also a shock which we won't spoil. During the second act there is a beautiful training lesson with Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) – this is brilliantly done with some very inventive CGI that shows the way he moves looking like he is flying. At one point there is a battle that has never been seen before in any film of this style and that is an astral projection battle between Strange and Lucian (Scott Adkins), which is just a gob smacking few minutes during the battle, and while they are at it they scare Christine this adds a bit of comedy to the scene. The clever screenplay also adds some hilarious moments where they are needed proving that the director can make a serious film with insane CGI and even add some comedy to the final production.Doctor Strange may be one of the strangest and possibly the most insane addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe but is still nonetheless entertaining and this proves that Marvel are keeping a better record with kick-ass origin stories, that are a spectacular CGI f**kathon and if the end result is this entertaining then that is a record that shall continue for decades, much better than the record currently obtained by the DCEU who at the moment need a miracle to overcome the disastrous films they've made lately. Easily one of the best films this year and shall be remembered for ages and who knows may even repeat the box-office record set by Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man. This is a strange world.VERDICT: The Marvel Cinematic Universe shines again with manipulative sorcery and cognitive storytelling as this may be the strangest addition but still delivers some kick-ass entertainment.8/10 powerfully manipulative.",8,140,251,25 October 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Three Billboards, five star execution.
","This review of Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is spoiler free***** (5/5)AFTER HIS OSCAR nominated debut In Bruges, British-Irish writer-director Martin McDonagh has gained a knack for his distinctive sensibilities as a filmmaker, his brilliant third endeavour Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a spectacular combination of his vulgar, politically incorrect, stupidly funny and unfathomably dark sense of humour. He's never too far away from the shockingly elements which tend to lead to awards-upsets. Here he hits pretty much the same notes as his predecessor Seven Psychopaths, except in many ways his latest has a far better - more interesting narrative behind it - he reliably never really falls back - in either his storytelling or his comedy antics. And the result is his most accomplished film of all time, but also it's one of the best and darkest comedies ever, and makes for one of the best films of all time. 
 
Frances McDormand gives a terrifying powerhouse performance as Mildred Hayes, a grieving single mother who is unable to come to terms that the local police haven't done anything about the death of her only daughter, seven months earlier. Living now with her son Robbie (a fantastic Lucas Hedges), she has an idea to post a message on the three billboards (outside Ebbing, Missouri - of course), the messages that she intends to print are legal, but also to angrily highlight the ineptitude of the local police force, one member in particular, the named Chief Bill Willoughby (Woody Harrelson). In a hope to call them out for making no arrests. Some including friends share their sympathy to her for getting justice, but others feel that her message is solely irresponsible, blankly pointing out the adored Chief Willoughby in short of making him look like a monster. These accusations hurt him. Yet nobody is as hurt as racist cop, Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell) who with his vicious demeanour and anger as a weapon does what he can to get revenge on Mildred trying to make her life a misery. 
 
Like In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths there's a lot going here, as the film often touches on the modern-day Western genre with his storytelling, McDonagh zigs around this small American town eloquently forming three brilliantly written intertwined narratives of three very different people, and he successfully zags through the rising tension of the townspeople who just want Mildred's fighting to cease. But full praise goes to McDormand, severely clad in dungarees, a bandana (an obvious reference to The Deer Hunter), complete with steel-toed boots and a devilish look in her eye. McDonagh has essentially turned her into a weapon of destruction and to be fair destruction is in her mind, and like a fiery gut punch her terrifying, yet brilliant performance will make your eyebrows singe (in a good way). 
 
Though anger is not the only element that works its way through here. Those familiar with McDonagh's work will see Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri as just another time to bring his darkly funny sense of humour to life - and you'd be right. But you'll be surprised to see that the film comes polished with warm beating heart one that pumps sympathy for its lead star and the other characters at work one that's both robustly drawn out and richly written and may even bring a tear to your eye. Unlike his brother John Michael McDonagh's War on Everyone, Martin has clearly made a triumphant move to America filled and filled it brilliant, masterful filmmaking, so much so that every moment here entrants in the purely distinctive American town life and landscape. And his clever mix in dark comedy, heartfelt drama and the blend of characters is like a Coen Brothers' film - and really, there's no higher compliment. 
 
VERDICT McDonagh's latest is a dizzying ride anchored by magnetic performances and virtuosic screenwriting it may be the latest in awards-upsets but it's certainly an entertaining and joyful one.",10,2,5,12 January 2018
Ant-Man," The amazing Ant-Man
",This my spoiler free review to the brand new edition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Ant-Man is a superhero who's rather very small in stature but he packs a powerful punch in the eyes of Marvel fans everywhere. The man inside the Ant suit is a burglar named Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) who tries to make a better living for himself and he does that by braking into peoples houses. The basic plot of Ant-Man: Scott Lang is a burglar trying to make a better living by doing burglary he then finds the ant suit and is confused as to why it is there. He then turns into the world's smallest hero specifically the smallest Avenger. That's it of the basic plot. This film has funny plot lines and really great characters. This film feels less Disney than any other Marvel Cinematic Universe film but I'm not the one to complain about that sort of thing. This movie has the best origin story since Spider-Man (2002) and is way better than the first Marvel installment this year and the post credit scene has a hint into the next big Marvel Cinematic Universe film in 2016. This film also has brilliant special effects and one-of-a-kind action scenes from the tiny insect to human sized. Another reason why this is good (opinion) is because it was made from the same studio as Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). So if you are a Marvel fan then this movie is a must see. You have to watch it till the post credit scene (Right at the very end). 10/10 truly f-Ant-astic.,8,1,6,27 July 2015
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," He just never stopped
","This is my review of Popstar Never Stop Never Stopping (spoiler free)**** (4/5)Cast: Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, Akiva Schaffer, Sarah Silverman, Tim MeadowsPlot: The life of superstar musician Conner4Real (Samberg) appears to be a charmed one, filled with groupies, screaming crowds and sacks of cash. But trouble is on the horizon in the form of a scheming rapper (Chris Redd), a disastrous merchandise deal and a swarm of killer bees.The spirit of This is Spinal Tap looms large over the latest comedy from the Lonely Island Crew. Like Rob Reiner's masterpiece, it's a mockumentary and a fun one at that with laughs coming out of the whazoo. It follows three likable idiots as they navigate the choppy waters of the music biz. There is even an update of Tap's 'Sh*t Sandwich' scene, as Conner4Real (Andy Samberg in possibly his funniest role ever) checks out reviews of his new album: rather than showing a star rating, Rolling Stone awards it the poop emoticon. Happily, rather than coming off as a pale imitation, Popstar: Never Sop Never Stopping squeezes laughs out of its tale like juice from a plum. However if the music industry was silly in the 1980s this certainly shows how silly it was but it's even daft now, and Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone and Akiva Schaffer gleefully go to town sending up its absurdities. Conner4Real is an ear studded jackass, whose humongous entourage includes an eyebrow specialist, a scarf caddy (that's a real thing) and a guy who punches him in the nuts to remind where he came from. Weirdly he has an army of personalized holograms that caper around the stage. Conner is a narcissist who uploads daily videos to Youtube, and who his best friend Owen (Taccone) to wear a deadmau5-like helmet that emits a terrifying light beacon and makes an ominous sound that is likely to deafen anybody that passes by. However Conner, is an attention seeker and there is nothing that he won't do to get attention – a trait that is consistently hilarious – and, given Miley's twerking and Kanye's tweet-based rants, it is all too plausible today. Hot Rod, which is the Lonely Island's film about a wannabe Evel Knievel, was at times hysterical, but lumbered with a weak narrative that really let it down. Popstar's set-up is simpler and more effective and won't fail to make you laugh. It turns out Conner4Real used to be just Conner, a decent guy who formed a boy band with Owen and his other buddy Lawrence (Schaffer) just because he wanted to see what it was like to be famous. When he got a taste for fame, he became a monster: Owen became his Dj-slave and Lawrence retired to a farm to whittle woodcarvings but unfortunately he hates that job but anything to get away from the monster. The story, as Owen attempts to reunite The Style Boyz which was the name of Conner's boy band, hat bit is surprisingly engaging. What they have added to the film are the inspired cameos peppered throughout the film mainly from the worlds of music (Arcade Fire, Justin Timberlake, Seal) and comedy (Will Forte, Bill Hader oddly with very long hair), and finally both (Weird Al Yankovic). On a weird note there is also a penis, which if reports are to be believed, belongs to an A-list director. This is Spinal Tap, of course was pinned around several gloriously bad songs, but they were enjoyable much like this the music is stupid but it's enjoyable even if some of it is offensive. But This is Spinal Tap lampooned around different genres of music. And Lonely Island certainly know their stuff because they know their way around a big juicy hook, which is what a song needs as anyone who has watched their Saturday Night Live videos can attest. Highlights here include Finest Girl, a sex jam with relentless references to the assassination of Osama Bin Laden, and Equal Rights, a paean to gay marriage filled with assurances that the singer is heterosexual. The tunes in this movie are whip-smart, quick-witted and stupendously dumb but that's a good because the hook makes them catchy that you'll be singing the hits well after the credits roll. In conclusion this is a quick-witted and well written comedy that will make you laugh out loud and even produce tears from your eyes. This is certainly a Lonely Island movie and probably one of the best of their movies it's completely relentless even the greatest comedy kings and queens will love it. Verdict: An absolute blast, with a frenetic strike-rate and songs that will worm their way into your ears for days. Like Conner, this comedy's for real. 8/10 incredibly funny",8,39,50,25 August 2016
Justice League," Poor Justice
","This review of Justice League is spoiler free** (2/5)Wonder Woman was a surprise addition to the DC Extended Universe, less tonally serious and more quick witted puns were to the screenplay mostly coming from Chris Pine's stammering Captain Steve Trevor granted it had seriousness to the story when Diana Prince had to fight her way through the flanks of men during World War I but mostly it was a fun adventure enlightened by the fantastic Gal Gadot and it was seen by man as the saviour of the DCEU. Justice League sees her replenish the role as the titular heroine, and again she's on top form using her sword (not the Godkiller) and Lasso of Truth to defeat a new villain which brings a threat to end the world. The question you're probably asking is; does she standout above all the men in DC's super-squad team up? Well if Ben Affleck's Batman had his way, then, sadly not, she's stunning when it comes to battling time but it's overall it's Affleck who holds most of the clan together. Thankfully, this isn't a bad thing as he's welcomed into the film with wide eyes from the audience; tonally his story is better, and, much lighter than last year's boringly brooding Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice which now we can likely forget. And maybe it's due to the lighter tone he's given after the various re-shoots from Joss Whedon after director Zack Snyder left for a family tragedy. It's not really surprising that Whedon comes with the lighthearted tone of the MCU's super-team-up Avengers Assemble, he adds several in-joke an obvious standout comes of course from Jeremy Irons' Alfred 'Those were the days where one's biggest concerns were exploding wind-up penguins' suggesting that Batman's past is much closer to Tim Burton's Batman than it is to the straight-faced antics of Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy; a notion reinforced by composer Danny Elfman (replacing Hans Zimmer) who here has a snatch from his infamous '89 Batman theme. Obviously re-hinting at the sillier past of the caped-crusader pushing the film away from Snyder's earlier DCEU entries and giving it an entirely new tone mash up. But Whedon's involvement of the Avengers'-lite plot does come with pointing out that he includes an alien villain who teams up with some other alien beings who look oddly like another Batman villain: Firefly (is it just us that noticed this?) But to be fair, it would be tricky to maintain post-Nolan somberness when Bruce teams up with an Amazon princess, a half-human-half-cyborg, and a big hairy merman who brings a pitchfork to a laser gun fight and commands the ocean, weird? Right?Sure Justice League is indeed some hokey stuff in terms of the super-team mash up they each get their time on the screen individually guiding the plot to follow their story in all this, first there's Aqauman (Jason Momoa) who only sees Bruce as guy who dresses up as a bat, his personality later transcends into sounding and looking like a rodeo clown, next we get Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) he's just a geeky guy who's never really been in battle, etc. This is about as much of their stories it has to offer, thanks to the mayonnaise plot the film suffers from several curses one of which is the 'too many characters, too little time' curse with five supers on the team each with their own personality they're left particularly nondescript they only have a few lines for plot before they have to battle. It's not all bad as Affleck can be forgiven for looking a little bit lost as the bruised world-weary Bruce. It makes sense that Batman would normally be excited by all this intergalactic, high-stakes idiocy, as well as being left behind during some of the action. Maybe next time he will get to play with some non-CG exploding penguins.VERDICT Fun and breezy at times, yet lumbered by the watery mayonnaise plotting offering little in the way of quality and reassuring a significant shortcoming of how forgettable it is.",4,4,8,19 November 2017
The Revenant," Survival of the fittest.
","This is my review of The Revenant (spoiler free).Cast: six time Academy Award nominee Leonardo DiCaprio, Academy Award nominee Tom Hardy*, Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter.Plot: Hugh Glass (DiCaprio)is a frontiersman out an adventure with his team in their fight for survival in the bitter landscape. When the unthinkable happens Glass' life is in the balance.Directed by Alejandro G. Inarritu (Birdman, 2014) over the period of five years in harsh conditions, this film literally changes the history of filming. Let me go through some points on why I think this is the film of the year:Performances: The performances throughout are all Oscar-worthy, especially considering that this is the first film with Leonardo DiCaprio, since The Wolf of Wall Street (2013). The performances are exceptional throughout and they didn't come out of character one single bit.Story: The story of the film keeps intact throughout regarding the length of the film. The director knew what story he wanted to do and he stayed with it.Lighting: There was no studio used to make this picture it was entirely around nature. The use of natural light in this film is the real clincher. The director didn't use any artificial light to take away the landscape.Atmospheric landscapes: This film is set in the American wilderness and was filmed in Calgary, Alberta. The acting isn't the only thing that makes the film,it is the beautifully atmospheric polar landscapes, from the vast forests to the incredible mountain ranges this film literally has it all. All in all this is the film of the year and I completely recommend it without regret, and I would go through the flaws at this point but there aren't any this film is flawless. Even though DiCaprio doesn't say that much I hope he wins the Oscar. 10/10 pure excellence, a must see.*Best performance by a supporting actor The Revenant (2015).",10,40,86,15 January 2016
Split," He could split any second
","This review of Split is spoiler free **** (4/5) Around the turn of the 21st century and even just before it, writer/director M. Night Shyamalan created a whole new genre with films such as the Oscar winning The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs: films with such intricate character studies with a deep paranormal vibe in even the littlest of characters, he even created a reverse spoof effect whereby (ghosts, superheroes and alien invaders) naturally through playing some tongue-in-cheek are sometimes presented in high seriousness, through intense sometimes scary, anguished central performances from even the most established male movie stars, and keeping the recurring theme of end of the reel twists which he associates through most of his films. He succeeded so well that there are even many signs of his success through some other director's films such as Joel Schumacher's Number 23, or Alex Proyas' Knowing both with Shyamalan-esque twists.Perhaps as a deep response to his success at becoming an imitable brand and perhaps down to the muted (and sometimes peculiarly hostile) response to The Village, Lady In The Water and The Happening (two of them are interesting films), Shyamalan moved from the tight vice-like grab of his personal cinema to take a shot at fantasy (The Last Airbender), sci-fi (After Earth) and found footage shocker (The Visit) let's just forget about those. With Split, he returns to 'Night Classic' mode. We're back in Philadelphia where soft-spoken, well-heeled simple go quietly mad and a psycho thriller that evolves into something weirder on the boiling-a-frog principle of slowly adding bizarre, perhaps sometimes freakish elements to an extreme truth-telling case study of one person or in this case 23 people. This time, perhaps frustrated by the attention paid to the easily parodied habit, Shyamalan eagerly holds off on a twist in favour of a measured well-constructed development of a far-out premise, though there is an intensely fan-satisfying development that pops up near the end.All the actors involved, James McAvoy, Anya Taylor-Joy etc. want to play Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and McAvoy seizes some of his antics with obvious relish on the role of man named Kevin, with 23 different personalities then to be eventually usurped by a 24th which is more animal than man. His head is finely stubbled as his Professor X cut grows out, he only uses a few props been supplied to him such as a pair of glasses and a woolly hat, but he mostly conveys Kevin's alters - from a gay fashion designer, to an OCD caretaker, a sinister British matriarch and a tittering small child - with a change of expression and voice. Granted it's a show-off tour de force performance, but McAvoy plays it well, though we only get to see nine of the 23 personalities which he can change into very easily with just an eye twitch reflex, he plays every one of them with perfect clarity - he's funny, creepy, threatening, pathetic and monstrous by turns. Note especially through set-pieces like his perfectly uncoordinated, crazy demonstration of what a nine-year-old might think are radical dance moves, and the unsettling moment where one of Kevin's more controlled, yet sinister persona impersonates a more open, appealing to reassure his analyst (Betty Buckley) through some unorganized appointments that things aren't going south in his skull.Though as often with Shyamalan, the actual as intricate as it may be is less important than the character studies. Even Kevin loses keen interest on two of his young captives, who get shoved into separate storerooms as misfit Casey (Taylor-Joy) emerges as the brave heroine, realizing she's most likely to survive by engaging with her captor rather than escaping by crawling ventilation ducts or relying on teen-princess karate lessons. It's fair to say that her life experience has prepared her for an ordeal such as this which is established in tactful, yet unsettling micro-flashbacks showing her traumatic life with some standout work from young actress Izzie Coffey, who's giant wide-eyes match Taylor-Joy's. It seems fair to say that after her performances in films such as The Witch and Morgan, Taylor-Joy is shaping up as the weird chick of her generation - but she has to work as hard as her brave character to find her proper screen-space here when her co-star is busily upstaging himself, as well as she is.VERDICT: This is an engaging thriller that's sometimes terrifying, it's provocative and it's thoroughly entertaining with an awards-caliber performance from McAvoy. It's fair to say Shyamalan is back to his best and is presumably here to stay.",8,1,9,20 January 2017
Wanted," Wanted...for being excellent
",I can't believe I waited 7 years to watch something fantastically brilliant. James McAvoy plays Wesley a man who who had a very ordinary life until he found out that he was an assassin with unlimited powers which allowed him to slow down time. This bullet bending thriller is an absolute popcorn action flick it's the way a modern action movie should be. In the end it turns out that he is one of the most wanted list created by The Fraternity leader Sloan (Morgan Freeman) and he is out to kill all the members including Wesley. I especially love the slow motion because it really adds to the action my favourite bit is when Wesley deploys a thousand rats into The Fraternity building and all the rats have bombs attached to them. If you want to watch this film get your popcorn ready it's going to be an excellent joy filled ride. 9/10 pure excellence.,8,1,2,17 January 2015
Dunkirk," Survival is Victory
","This review of Dunkirk is spoiler free***** (5/5)CHRISTOPHER NOLAN HAS shown time and time again that he is no stranger to massive box-office breaking productions which come with genre busting techniques, he's done magic in The Prestige, he's done superhero in The Dark Knight Trilogy, to a mind-bending dream world in Inception and finally he's done Matthew McConauhey being sucked into a black hole in Interstellar. His latest is essentially his The Longest Day having trying his hand at a war drama, although it is in fact his shortest film since his 2002 remake of Insomnia standing at only 106 minutes it's an epic feat showing that he doesn't need length. In fact, throughout it's entirety it's one big battle in a slight deviation from that first thirty minute opening of Saving Private Ryan or the big battle towards the end of Hacksaw Ridge no, Nolan kick starts this with the action and refuses to let up. Dunkirk is intense, set in May 1940 on the beaches of Dunkirk, France 400,000 allied soldiers with teams of French, Canadian and British soldiers are evacuating the battle in a desperate attempt to get home, instead during their fight for survival home comes to them. During this evacuation there are several destroyers, medical ships lead by Kenneth Branagh's naval captain, all while in the midst of German fighters trying to gun them down. There are spitfire's that fly through in protection for the allies flown by a team of pilots led by Tom Hardy's hot-headed pilot Farrier, in the water, Mark Rylance's Man on the Boat is heading towards the war in an attempt to pick up soldiers. A powerful introduction to an intense war drama which is incredibly by Nolan on his IMAX camera, along with the beautiful cinematography and Hans Zimmer's eerily incredible score and it's brilliant. Every scene is handled perfectly nothing feels out of place from the fighter jet's gunfire, through the incredible heroics of Rylance, to the rough waters below Nolan's camera weavers through these intense dramatic moments smoothly not avoiding any detail and it's wonderful.Where the action is its strongest is in the skies. The allied soldiers are constantly bombarded by German fire, there are allied planes flying in from every corner in a desperate attempt to gun them down. Yesteryear's audience would've settled at watching digital laser dogfights in Star Wars but today we get bullets flying, planes dropping and smoke engulfing the screen and it's brilliant. In addition, unlike any other war film Nolan doesn't linger on the violence of war he doesn't refrain his camera to piles of bodies with there intestines hanging out, or having missing limbs, no here he finds a new path for his focus; the psychosis of it all, the pain of being shot or nearly drowning, the torment of constant gunfire, and the fear of having shell shock a message which Cillian Murphy fantastically conveys. The performances are excellent too, though there is limited dialogue Nolan handles his actors brilliantly teetering through several different perspectives, there's one on the docks, on the planes and on the ground with the youngsters. However, despite having the star power of his older cast their characterization is sadly limited to their jobs Murphy is just a whining soldier, Rylance is the man on a boat, Branagh is just the naval captain and Hardy is the pilot there's no other characterization that goes beyond that. It's the newcomers who are the real stars led by Fionn Whitehead's Tommy who leads the team of young survivors to rescue, they're put through a string of dramatic moments they are shot at, they are drowned and they are forced to make sacrifices to save themselves. Their performances excel Whitehead is brilliantly quiet he is teamed up with Alex (Styles) who mostly seems disappointed that he didn't fight for his country. The two work together to save themselves and their teammates. Still, despite the slight drop in the older characters, Dunkirk is an excellent piece of filmmaking which excels in brilliant cinematography, a fantastic score, shining camera angles and brilliant performances this is easily Nolan's best film since Inception and it could just be the best film of 2017.VERDICT: Nolan's latest is an intense war drama which holds no bars to the torture of those men and ultimately pays off in style as an excellent lesson in history.",10,8,18,21 July 2017
The Lego Movie," Family fun
",This original creative animation is fantastic and fun for all the family Chris Pratt who plays Emmett is a builder like everybody else at least that's what he thinks. Emmett is just an ordinary guy in an extraordinary city and really turns out that he copies everything that everyone else does. He meets a woman named Lucy/Wildstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and she trusts him to find his skill to be a megabuilder. They go on this great adventure which along the way they meet some extraordinary characters and they all fight together to save the world my favourite part is when Good Cop/Bad Cop is played Liam Neeson and also when they go into the real world with Will Ferrell playing the little lad's father and they get along so well at the end. Fantastic fun for all the family. 10/10.,8,0,2,25 January 2015

This film is action packed from start to finish and with a story to hold it all together. Another amazing entry to Marvel Cinematic Universe.After the Avengers fell apart in last years Avengers: Age of Ultron with that Captain America and Iron Man form their own team to fight for justice, although Thor and Hulk are nowhere to be seen.Here are the reasons why this is a must see: Blistering Action: Theaction scenes are very spectacular throughout with new moves from each of the heroes. The action is very fast paced and and loud which is to be expected. Which all leads up to the outstanding final fight.No Disney feel: Although this film is Disney because it is part of their MCU franchise this is more serious than the other ones, it still has the funny dialogue.This film is the start of phase 3 of the MCU and it is a wonderful start. Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Crossbones (Frank Grillo) all make their first appearance but they don't go amiss because they make a massive impact.The dialogue is kind of slow but it is very intellectual but it's all worth it because the final battle is just extremely fun and makes the whole film worthwhile.Does this final film in the Captain America trilogy end winningly?

Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," 6 points to hufflepuff
","This review of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is spoiler free*** (3/5) NOT LONG AFTER director James Mangold announced that his new film Logan won't be much of a CGI f**kathon and will have a lot of action to dominate the story, author and first time screenwriter J.K. Rowling announced that Fantastic Beasts will be a series of five just to try and match the previous of her adaptations; though you have to credit her for the extraordinary skill of adapting a big screen spin off/prequel/extended universe, not too long after the previous big screen adaptation from her novels lasting a total of eight films. This story originally published in 2001 by Rowling and has the names and habitats of around 85 different magical beasts, it focuses on former Hogwarts student turned scatterbrained friendly magizoologist Newt Scamander and his adventures and misadventures of finding and catching these critters around the 1920s.Fantastic Beasts' story opens promisingly with our hero Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) stepping off the ship in Gatsby-era New York in 1926, while he is there he meets with no-maj short for no-magic Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) who conveniently has the same briefcase as Newt except Newt's is filled with the many habitats of his magical beasts, and Jacob's is not then they are met by Tina short for Porpetina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) one of the members of the MACUSA (Magical Congress of the United States of America) and it is her job to investigate any unregistered wizard who comes through the city. Until a few beasts set themselves free from Newt's briefcase and a whole plethora of dark forces try to take it off him. But what could be wrong with this? Unfortunately like the first Harry Potter it has a few things wrong with it. Firstly the screenplay by first time screenwriter J.K. Rowling is a little muddled and spends too much time with trying to put on some funnier dialogue for the different characters. Secondly, the film spends too much of its time constantly building the wizarding world and the muggle world surrounding it, be that as it may it's beautiful and done well but it's not necessary.There are couple of new villains introduced one being the shrewd Percival Graves (Colin Farrell) one of the more senior members of the MACUSA who doesn't really take no for an answer as he is trying to catch Newt as he thinks he is a bad influence to the magic world. The second being Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller) who could essentially be seen as the new Lord Voldemort he is an adopted child of the wizard loathing Mary Lou (Samantha Morton), who constantly makes his life miserable as she tries to take over him. Credence is a rather person who has a very strong power overtaking and it is Newt Scamander's job to find that power and put it back where it belongs, unfortunately while he tries he goes through some mass difficulty as not only is there a horrendous dark force trying to take over the world but he also has to outrun Percival Graves who doesn't much like Newt as soon as he meets him.Later, when Newt is trying to catch the beasts that have come loose each scene is dedicated to catching them but while it's done well and beautifully created by the FX team and it's nice to see this included, they tend to drag and take a while to warm up to each of them and take a while settle in trying to figure out where it is going. There are a couple of fun moments for example the no-maj Jacob being introduced to the magical habitats of his beasts, and also Newt performing a mating dance to one of the more larger beasts which isn't commonly something you would see from an Oscar winner but it is fun to see, but unfortunately other than that there isn't much going for Fantastic Beasts also there is the Thunderbird named Frank which makes a convenient pet but also manages to reduce everything that Newt has done wrong.Despite some of the scenes being dragged, the constant world building and the muddled screenplay this makes for a decent adaptation of yet another Rowling novel featuring some rather fantastical beasts ranging from very tiny to extremely large, that has some fun throughout some good CGI beasts created them with the image of the FX team it still has some magic at its heart.VERDICT: While constantly concentrating too much on the beautiful world building, this makes for a decent adaptation with some rather fantastical beasts, decent performances that still has some magic left at its heart.6/10 6 points to hufflepuff",6,3,7,18 November 2016
The Conjuring 2," North London haunting
","This is my review of The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Case (spoiler free)***** (5/5)Cast: Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga, Madison Wolfe, Frances O'Connor.Plot: Lorraine (Farmiga) and Ed Warren (Wilson) travel to north London to help a single mother raising four children alone in a house plagued by malicious spirits. I just want to start by saying this the best sequel to a horror that I have ever seen, the first Conjuring (2013) was the only horror to scare me and this, this is exactly the same. Director James Wan is known in most parts as the master of horror I think he is living up to that name. After the previous movie he directed Fast & Furious 7 (2015) which made a billion dollars worldwide, he said however before making that he was never going to make anymore horrors which is fine because loads of directors change their genre. Just like the original this has a very good plot which is known all around the UK as fake it was made up, because a poltergeist is a spirit that is made normally by teenagers, this is basically the story of how real those were. The original one the reason why I like these films so much is because they have a dark atmosphere, a good plot, good acting and basically just feels real like you're really there it's terrifying. Also I like to add that in the first each time before the scare there was suspense and the suspense is exactly the same in this one if not better. In my opinion a horror is supposed to scary and this just like the original are way better than the PG-13 jump scares, like the Paranormal Activity series.In the first one we saw that the spirit was haunting a child and this is the same except somewhat different, the spirit is haunting 11 year old Janet Hodgson (Wolfe) but not just her it seems the spirit wants the whole family out. They seek the help of spirit hunters Ed (Wilson) and Lorraine (Farmiga) Warren to see if they can help their haunting problem it's basically the same as the first but who said you can't follow originality. It feels real as you're watching it, it genuinely feels like there is something behind you. The first Conjuring as I previously was the first actual to scare the living daylights out of me, and this as I said before is the same.Here are some reasons as to why I think this is a horror not to be missed:Story: Like the first one this has a terrific story which is conveniently based on a true story which everybody around the UK knows it was made up. This time it is set 6 years after the events of the first one. There is the connection in this story however it doesn't even show you a glimpse of what happened last time but this is still the sequel. It's basically the same story as first except no creepy doll this time and that is when you should keep the originality. The story is truly scary and will probably scare you too.Connection between movies: There isn't really a connection it just continues of sorts but it is the sequel because as it says on the poster The Conjuring 2. There is little connection however not shown anywhere in the film. I am just glad there is a sequel.The real moral of this story is that it's not about ghosts or ghouls, or anything creepy, it just shows you how bad the weather is in England. The real reason I gave it 10/10 is because it is the perfect sequel to a perfect horror that is of course an opinion. At this point I would be stating the faults of this movie but there really isn't any. The special effects are amazing and it is truly a terrifying spectacle that is just as good or better than the first. Just a true delight.Verdict: Terrifying, and will hopefully scare the living daylights out of you. A worthy sequel James Wan you are the king. 10/10 worth every single penny.",8,4,10,14 June 2016
Avengers: Infinity War," To Infinity
","This review of Avengers: Infinity War is spoiler free***** (5/5)IT'S ALREADY CLEAR that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has installed a lot of pressure on themselves, with social media it's hard enough to create an ongoing trend, but as soon as the trailer for Marvel's 19th and biggest film Avengers: Infinity War launched it became the largest trailer ever on the web with more than 200 million views in just 24 hours. That was a monster record in itself as no other trailer has ever done that, addition to that the pre-sale tickets were selling like hot cakes. The pressure was perhaps too much at this point and there was quite a bit of speculation whether the film would live up to the almost infinite (sorry) hype, well, the time is here as brother directors Anthony and Joe Russo have created an unmissable Marvel film that delivers a dark storyline featuring shock to shock. Firstly, Infinity War isn't just the culmination of the last few years of Marvel installments, it is the culmination of the last 18 Marvel in ten years, starting from the first Iron Man to now and take our word for it, it's worth every second of the ride. This one opens without the traditional Marvel fanfare overshadowing the logo, instead it's almost deafening, we open not long after the impact of Thor: Ragnarok with the destruction of Asgard and suddenly Thanos (Josh Brolin) a giant purple gilactic warlord puts the survivors to the ultimate test to try and possess all the six Infinity Stones which will put him in control of the entire universe. But it's from minute one that Thanos is not a villain that can be beaten with just the swing of a hammer (Thor should know that), the Avengers are put to the ultimate test. Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) is challenged strength to strength. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is tested through his limits. Captain America (Chris Evans) will find that this is no easy war to win. The story written by Captain America: Civil War writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely is dark, darker than all the previous Marvel films before, here nobody is left without a fight, and in terms of scope this has the biggest ever battle scene (but we'll get to that). And at the helm is Marvel's darkest, deadliest and strongest villain Thanos and it's Josh Brolin who's up for the role once again as he said at the end of Age of Ultron 'I'll do it myself' and he delivers in spades delivering shock to shock, many dark turns and lots and lots of bodies at his feet. And it's clear that the Russo's have brought the impossible to life, and it won't leave without deeply cutting into your very skin. How dark is the story? Well that really depends on how much light is at the end of the 149 minute long tunnel, but in terms of how many lives are at stake probably not much. But just like every other Marvel villain Thanos comes with a past, and Thanos' past isn't anything to be triffled with, a past that's filled with war, turmoil and death but anybody who knows his history should know how dark he really is, and despite the many family friendly filters there are through the never-ending saga, he is the darkest one ever. Yet, thanks to Brolin's fantastic performance he's also the most compelling, yes you heard that right he's even more compelling than Loki. But unlike the Asgardian God of Mischief the giant purple warlord isn't simply misunderstood, neigh, he's just a menace. However prepared you may be to watch Thanos putting the universe through ultimate destruction, you aren't ready for the damage he might leave behind, and put it this way, there's a lot of deep scars here, so prepare for the damage. Yet, the film isn't always dark, there is some lightness here. It's also very, very funny. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is momentarily left speechless. The Guardians are up to to their usual high stakes camaradarie, Star Lord (Chris Pratt) isn't afraid to show his light self, Drax (Dave Bautista) once again shares his comedic duo act with Rocket (Bradley Cooper). It's almost as if McFeely and Markus watched both Guardians of the Galaxy films and jotted down all the jokes. But honestly who would blame them?Happier still with a long running time, a compelling villain, an all star cast, some very funny jokes and several storylines to follow Avengers: Infinity War stays massively intact thanks to the Russo's exquisite directing style who handle the project beautifully, from handling the massive cast without feeling any fatigue (sorry Joss Whedon), through the expensive yet stunning CGI battles, to the mammoth sized final battle scenes. If you thought the battle of Sakovia in Avengers: Age of Ultron or the battle at Berlin's Leipzig airport in Captain America: Civil War was big then this is a mammoth battle. Indeed Infinity War is worth the decade long wait and who knows maybe the currently untitled Avengers 4 may be bigger than this. However big it is, we certainly can't wait. VERDICT: Quick on it's wits and quick on it's whims, the 19th MCU film delivers all of them on an intergalactic scale, you may not be prepared for Thanos, but then neither are our heroes.",10,19,51,26 April 2018
Get Out," Get In!
","This review of Get Out is spoiler free**** (4/5)AS IT HAPPENS, there is indeed no perfect time for Jordan Peele's directorial debut to come out. In a year when we've already had Hidden Figures, Loving, Fences and the Best Picture winning Moonlight taking their challenging turns in showing how racist America used to be. Peele who's also lived with racism decided to input all them racist thoughts into the incredible Get Out. The social commentary is cleverly crafted, too, not only adapting racism to the 21st century but also giving hilarious moments especially from the scene stealingly funny LilRel Howery who thinks that Chris is being hypnotized into a sex slave, cleverly changing the narrative but also giving laugh out loud moments. The film's design is purely intended to lift the façade of post-racial America and showcase the ugliness still lying beneath; the astounding thing about it is he not only sharply manages to craft the film with racism but crafting it so that he even made a hugely entertaining thriller with horror elements. Still it's not an easy watch for the modern audience, given that a young African-American man as a target for this goes without saying horrific, but incredibly well. The young African-American man here is Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) who's in a relationship with a young Caucasian woman Rose (Allison Williams), he's particularly nervous having never met her parents. He gets the idea that they're going to hate him, while on the other hand trying to make him a slave. When they arrive her parents immediately take a liking to him, they become instant friends. This is when the film changes pace, Chris notices that aren't quite right with this average American family estate he takes a certain notice to the African-American janitor and housemaid helping on the house - perhaps hinting that this family are stuck in the past. Peele makes us wait for even an immediate thrill to take place, to perhaps give us a jolt, but it's as while before this happens yet when it does the Goosebumps are relentless it's only a second but it's effective. Given that the tension slowly rises and it keeps our fixed gaze on the screen. Keeps the audience on edge as if tied to the seat, wondering what's going to happen next. What follows are relentless thrills and jump scares as Chris is scared lifeless, he's hypnotized to quit smoking which takes to bigger effect later, and he's left to a moment when he has to escape after being brutally warned to 'Get out' by a fellow African-American in post-trance state. Peele amps the tension up to 11 here giving no boundaries as to how far he'll take this. The secret reveal takes a turn for the worse when Chris finds that his girlfriend isn't who she says she is – adding to the rising shock factor.Slowly turning into an escape movie when Chris is hypnotized he has to escape from a cell-like room. It has moments of Stepford Wives and there is a deer antler impalement reference from Silent Night, Deadly Night. This confident debut is never boring, it's hilarious, it's thrilling and it's original. Peele has come a long way since the altruistic comedy standings of Key and Peele and last year's muddled, Keanu. But here his dark side shows it's strength, Get Out is the cleverest horror we've had in ages and it's just what we need. VERDICT: A thrillingly confident debut by Peele a masterfully constructed plot carefully matching horror with hilarious social commentary with natural seat-edge suspense.",8,9,18,17 March 2017
Room," A world of their own
","This is my review of the ever so uplifting Room (spoiler free)Cast: Academy Award nominee Brie Larson*, Jacob Tremblay and 3 time Academy Award nominee Joan Allen.Plot: Ma (Larson) is kidnapped at the age of seventeen and she is kept prisoner in a 10 foot room in a garden shed. She is constantly trying to escape her prison while her son, 5 year old Jack (Tremblay) is always wondering about the outside world.Directed by Lenny Abrahamson known for the quirky yet witty comedy Frank (2013). Room is a truly inspirational story and is always heartwarming from start to finish.Brie Larson (Trainwreck) has always been threatening to outbreak and in this film she does exactly that, however nine year old Jacob Tremblay's performance is beyond awe-inspiring, normally a child actor is only ever as good as their director but that is not the case in this feelgood and at points heartbreaking picture.This film literally open's a new door in the art of film making and will have you gripped from start to finish, this film will make you smile or make you cry, it will grab you by the heart and it will never let go. This is a film that is painful to watch I completely 100% recommend it, in my opinion this one of the best films of the year and it is a must see, even though it is very painful to watch at some points I think this is a total masterpiece 10/10. Just perfect.*Best performance by an actress in a leading role Room, 2015",8,1,6,22 January 2016
A Quiet Place," A silent masterpiece
","This review of A Quiet Place is spoiler free**** (4/5)JUST TO THINK, it was only as recent as last year when a person would emerge from an extensive comedy background to direct a horror film - it was, of course, writer-director Jordan Peele who before his box-office breaking, Best Picture nominated debut Get Out he was known for his eccentric comedy outbursts with his co-worker and best friend Keegan-Michael Key on the Emmy winning show Key and Peele. Now - just over a year later we get John Krasinski who like Peele is known for various comedy shows (most notably The Office USA) and his latest film A Quiet Place - which, in short, is a spine-tingling, nerve-shredding horror that ultimately refuses to let up from start to finish. The premise is pure monster horror - the cataclysm after these monsters have invaded is on a global scale, it's a high-concept monster movie works by simply narrowing it's focus...survival. And just as the human characters (what about the monsters? We'll get to them) try to muffle out the sound by shuffling sand along the floor and making their own home quiet enough to walk around, director Krasinski (who also co-stars and writes) with writers Bryan Woods and Scott Beck keep a tight-knit, all-frills locked specifically on tension that just keeps on building up and up until the ladder just can't be seen any more. Krasinski however isn't afraid to assume you already know an outcome by opening the film on the 90th day of the invasion clearly avoiding the manic-day-one tactic (where we can probably guess a lot of bad stuff happened), no, he approaches the subject with experienced characters. Paths have been set with sand, cars have been abandoned, and his house has been completely sound proofed, with carpets, sand set like stepping stones and the family only communicates by sign language.
 
Krasinski plays a competent, intelligent, desperate family man who tries to keep things together in his little kingdom (an abandoned farm house) instantly knowing that even the most negligible dropped clanger will attract terrifying toothsome, long-armed creatures with avocado -shaped skulls which are entirely composed by inner-ear architecture and teeth morphing their heads to hear even the slightest of sounds. Are they aliens? Are they vampires? Or possibly alien vampires (if you want to go creepy)? If indeed the characters had abstract conversations, maybe they'd wonder what they're being hunted by but instead they can only express the barest essential dialogue in order to survive as long as possible. While he pays off as the caring rather rugged survivalist keeping a slight fire ready for a beacon signifying survival, meanwhile his pregnant wife (Emily Blunt) is a rather obvious symbolism of hope for the future she also tries her hardest to keep the rest of her family in check. There's a slight everyday quality to this family that happily allows for you to invest more so in their journey for survival. Though their vulnerability is heightened just that little bit more and also enriched at the fact that there's a child on the way (a newborn that doesn't quite understand the importance of staying quiet) and what they must do in the situation when Blunt is just about to have it. Happily even during those moments Krasinski still keeps A Quiet Place original for example what do you do if you don't hear the monsters coming? Well, there's an answer for that here as the eldest daughter Regan (Millicent Simmonds) is deaf so she can't hear the monsters coming and for that it's intensity is heightened. It's a film that just refuses to let up, and why should it? In short, Krasinski is already a well-known comedian and who knows it may even end up being like Get Out.
 
VERDICT Originally nightmarish and a genuinely tense horror which just doesn't let up and by removing the sound it genuinely makes things that bump in the night so much louder. Horror at its best.",8,36,74,5 April 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Abandon Ship
","This review of Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge (Dead Men Tell No Tales) is spoiler free** (2/5)WHEN YOU GET on a theme park ride for the first time it's an original piece of memory that you will never forget, but when you return to the ride multiple times it gets monotonously tedious. Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge (changed its name from the US title Dead Men Tell No Tales) is just like that it's the same thing over and over again. And for the fifth film in the franchise it's exactly the same ride. Promising a return to form to 2003s original film; Curse of the Black Pearl Captain Jack Sparrow and his bunch of misfits are back but not to the return to form we expect. Story-wise it's the same thing, there's yet another pay-check seeking villain Javier Bardem's Captain Salazar – and his crew of ghosts manning a ghost ship out for revenge and there's another mishmash of a plot to hold it all together. We open with Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) the adult son of 2003s titular show runner Will Turner (Orlando Bloom who's back in full swing), on a search for Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) who's been missing for some years. He goes on a mission to find the lost trident of Poseidon to end his father's curse. A racy yet stunning opening to kick start it's promised return to form, this holds wholly well for the fifth film, there's a stunning set-piece of Jack being dragged by a moving building through a backdrop of a Caribbean island. A hilarious set-piece that holds firm in the film's first act thanks to the stunning cinematography, a drunk Jack who's surprisingly back to his unhinged form that nailed his character's strength in the first film. Though after horrendously bad ideas that pile up he's ridiculously routine, thus putting a barrier over his loose hinge. Through these it adds up to the same ride, yet much less fun than the previous four times.On a fair scale you have to credit Norwegian directing team Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg who found their sea-legs in 2012s Kon-Tiki, the fault of the bad ideas aren't all theirs it's the editing, the best bits happen to straggle in the film's first half. On that note there's a rotating Guillotine, centrifugal to it's axis it spins several times over, the audience look on unblinkingly while the room fills with laughter. Moistly to the look on Jack's face as this makes him dizzy. But this quickly dwindles the film's promising due to the piling bad ideas, the continuous jokes (the word 'witch' is on repeat), and the additional flimsy CG. The first act's hilarious swashbuckling proves to be the strongest force.There's a return of older characters that have been here since the beginning too, specifically when we revisit Geoffrey Rush's Captain Barbosa he's living the high life after the death of On Stranger Tides' villain, Blackbeard. This is short lived once he hears the news of Salazar's return, he proves to be the reigning strength yet through the film's clogging list of ideas he's long-winded. Salazar seeks out his help to find Jack, along the way coming up with plans to kill him. Enter a much-needed flashback showing the origin of Salazar's revenge, it's here when the flimsy CG first comes to light (Depp's computerized younger self is an example of this), the film improves slightly over the previous misinterpreted Pirate venture of mythology. The new players improve it too; Henry Turner falls for an attractive adventurer Carina Smyth (Maze Runner's Kaya Scodelario) she sees adventure with Jack's crew as he goes in search for something weird. For some moments it runs the same storyline as the first adventure it shows this in full swing as Salazar is trying to stop Jack from doing his job.Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge follows along the lines of mythology too, Jack still has his magic compass which points to things he wants most in life, there are zombie sharks, and there is a cacophonous plot involving the lost trident of Poseidon which Jack must find to end Will's curse. Due to the bad ideas that pile up throughout it's not the return to form that was promised but thanks to a strongly hilarious first act it's along the lines of improvement over the last Pirate adventure. This is not the worst film this far into the series and it's certainly far from the best but there is improvement. VERDICT: A dull pirate venture for Jack and crew's return that promises a return to form but after piles of bad ideas and flimsy CG this is one ship that Depp's promising performance can't save.",4,24,48,26 May 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," Apocalypse Now
","X-Men: Apocalypse review (spoiler free).Director: Bryan Singer Distributor: Fox Cast: James McAvoy, 2 time Oscar Nominee Michael Fassbender*, Oscar Winner Jennifer Lawrence**, Oscar Isaac, Nicholas Hoult, Sophie Turner with Ben Hardy and Evan Peters, Kodi Smit-Mcphee.Plot: With the emergence of the world's first mutant, Apocalypse, the X-Men must unite to defeat his extinction level plan.After X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) being probably the best in the X-Men series and still is it made all the other X-Men films look pointless. Director Bryan Singer who made three other X-Men films returns with the ninth in the series (including Deadpool) which started back in 2000, 16 years later he directs an entirely new cast.X-Men: Apocalypse may not be as good as Days of Future Past but it is still an enjoyable Marvel film, Charles Xavier (McAvoy), Eric Lensherr Magneto (Fassbender), and Raven/Mystique (Lawrence) all return for the third and last time and those characters leave the series with a bang. With the re-introduction of Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler (Smit-Mcphee), previously played by Alan Cumming and Jean Grey/Pheonix (Turner cast because of Game of Thrones), previously played by Famke Janssen the X-Men series seems to be continuing on a massive scale even there are seven previous films.This film has plenty of action and a sort of origin story with the new characters including the first ever appearance of En Sabah Nur a.k.a Apocalypse (Isaac), who is the first ever and most powerful mutant the X-Men have ever faced.Here are some points why I think this is one of the must see superhero films this year: New Characters: Although most of the characters have been seen before for example Nightcrawler, Jean Grey, Storm etc. the film also introduces new characters and they are (only two), Phsylocke played by Olivia Munn and Apocalypse played by Oscar Isaac previously know for Ex-Machina (2015) and Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015). These two new characters make a big impact on the film and on the heroes themselves.CGI good and bad point: CGI is the main component of this film because you think superheroes it's going to be massive amounts of CGI. The CGI in this film literally makes buildings crumble and entire cities get destroyed by the shear might of Apocalypse. In some parts of the film the CGI looks a little incomplete there are few parts where it is unnecessary especially during the main battle where you can clearly tell it is a green-screen. Other than than the CGI is well used and well just a great component.One bad point: Apocalypse in the comics is an all powerful being that all of the X-Men fear even the more powerful ones, but in the film he is powerful but in my personal opinion I feel they picked the wrong actor, Oscar Isaac doesn't play evil well and that's a bad thing because I had really hopes for that character.Take the two good points into account and this is actually a pretty good superhero that does fall a little flat granted but that happens, if this was Singer's X-Men 3, if only he had made X-Men 3. Not nearly as good as Days of Future Past but still a decent addition to the X-Men franchise and hope that the X-Men series still lives on for years to come.Verdict: Enjoyable addition to the franchise with an immense ensemble of characters, but doesn't live up to the brilliance that is Days of Future Past and Apocalypse called have been played better. 8/10 Excellent.*Best performance by an Actor in a supporting role 12 Years a Slave (2013), Best performance by an Actor in a leading role Steve Jobs (2015). **Best performance by an Actress in a leading role Silver Linings Playbook (2012).",6,5,11,18 May 2016
Hidden Figures," Rocketing to the stars
","This review of Hidden Figures is spoiler free**** (4/5)THERE IS A LOT we know or may know about NASA, especially the moon landing of 1969, but what happened before that pinnacle moment in American history? Surprising as it may be NASA has a hidden story. Hidden Figures sets that story for the big screen, set in Virginia, 1961 a time when people never expected women to amount to anything, especially women of colour who were still used for help around houses in that time, this well-crafted film sets the tale of how a trio of African-American boffins changed the face of not just America but NASA too. We open with Katherine Johnson (Henson) as a child and how she succeeded as a mathematician, it's not much of an origin story but it's well-crafted nonetheless. Then the film shifts to when she is grown up surrounded by her two best friends Dorothy (Spencer) a computer programmer and Mary (Janelle Monáe) an engineer these three have a dream to change the world, but when they get to their destination at NASA they are bombarded by racism, sexism, that doesn't stop them from achieving their dream. Writer/director Theodore Melfi makes us wait a while for these women to achieve big however he uses this time well, crafting these women to become big historic figures takes time, Katherine is a brilliant mathematician when she is assigned to another part of the building it is her job to look up some numbers, there is one member of her new team who doesn't like her straightaway, but she is determined to show these men exactly what she can do. Granted she may be the subject of bullying at her job but she is strong-willed and doesn't let these bullies get the best of her. But not only is she a hard-worker, she's also a mother having to take care of her three children after the death of her husband. She's shy of meeting a new man until she meets the one of her dreams, who changes her life for the better. Until, the building decides to bring in faster super-computers she starts to feel scared about her job so she is keen to keep her job going until the computers start to work. This is when we see what soft-talking Dorothy can do when she starts to work her magic on the computers. At this point Mary finds out that she can't be an engineer without any specific qualifications she flips out and decides to go back to school. In the third act when their lives start to get better, suddenly the computers start to work so Katherine is not needed any more, this is when the film loses its momentum it spends a lot of time trying to get it back by coming with various equations for the Earth landing which need to be confirmed, it struggles to get the momentum back. Granted the story loses its momentum, but Hidden Figures hits almost every beat with perfect execution, it's an empowering story of inspirational women who changed the world of space travel forever; it has a lot of detail, a lot of technical speech it's very funny in places, there is plenty here to enjoy and is just a another addition to the already huge list of inspirational stories.VERDICT: A warmhearted, witty and truly inspirational story. Hidden Figures hits many beats big or small with almost perfect execution that propels the film forward with non-stop motion.",8,1,7,17 February 2017
Coco," Very tasty animation
","This review of Coco is spoiler free**** (4/5)DIRECTOR PETE DOCTER'S Oscar winning Inside Out wasn't just a film about four colourful characters with very different emotions. It was also one of the best looking animated features in recent years, with that and a heart-wrenching message at the end it was one of the films that firmly secures it among the Pixar greats with Toy Story (all of them), Up and WALL-E - and to be fair it deserves to be up there. 
 
Their latest, Coco happily joins that list from a creativity point of view. The film takes place in Mexico taking a broad focus on the country's art, music, history and the customs including the annual Day of the Dead festival. We open with 12-year-old Miguel (Gonzalez) an aspiring musician who dreams of being famous like his idol Ernesto De La Cruz (Bratt) however his family's ancestral ban stops him from pursuing the dream. With his persistence and guitar in hand he's transported to the Land of the Dead. A musical underground town that's filled with high-rises beautifully lit streets, skeletons and spirit animals and thanks to the bright colour palette and stunning animation the film looks dazzling as Miguel travels through the town. 
 
Typically like other Pixar top-formers it doesn't come without their storytelling grandeur, like with Up and WALL-E it comes with love and with Inside Out it hits all the points of emotion - this one is profound in cleanly cut messages; family, love, life and death (yes there's even death in the afterlife). However the toughest truth that the film comes with is the true power of forgetting (a disappearing skeleton is a sensational standout). And director Lee Unkrich's (Toy Story 3) approach to each will leave a soulful tear running down your cheek - and let's be honest we wouldn't blame you.
 
You have to credit Pixar for taking a beautiful look at another culture, yet full praise goes to the entirely Mexican-American voice cast from Gael García Bernal who plays Miguel's crafty skeletal guide, via Bratt as his idol and Alanna Ubach as his vicious Mamá Imelda etc. Still the best performance goes to Gonzalez as Miguel he shows pure confidence even with the film's blissful musical numbers. And it's here when Coco shows off its highest note, the music is fun, it's cheerful and giddy, yet like Disney's other musical gems the notes often hit right at home and this one is definitely no exception to that. 
 
Their 19th film is indeed a flourishing return to form for Pixar, however it's not perfect as the story often covers similar ground with 2014s The Book of Life and sadly falls out of tune with that sudden drop. Still with that said Coco is a beautiful, colourful and emotional look into Mexico's artful culture, one that will leave a warm feeling deep in your heart and will have you dancing even after the credits stop. 
 
VERDICT The latest offering from Pixar is a true artscape of colourful animation and raw emotional storytelling if the afterlife is this exciting then death truthfully shouldn't be anything to fear.",8,0,1,19 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Master Jedi
","This review of Star Wars: The Last Jedi is spoiler free**** (4/5)Questions were asked after the 2 hour 16 minute runtime of 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens'. 'What's happened to Luke Skywalker?' 'Why did he disappear?' were just a couple of the seemingly millions of questions coming from fans as they walked out of the cinema. For a while it seemed like these questions were never going to be answered, or perhaps not receive a clear enough answer anyway. After a two year wait you can finally get those answers you were looking for. Hello writer-director Rian Johnson, a director with a clear insight, some brass balls and a camera in hand that creates one of the best 'Star Wars' films to date. Gift wrapping it with a bold, dark, often heartbreaking, moving and tense touch, it's certainly the film that fans of the saga have been waiting for and it definitely couldn't be timelier.After 'The Force Awakens' ended with Rey (Daisy Ridley) handing an elderly Luke Skywalker (Hamill) that lightsaber (that moment here is a throwaway, literally), Johnson decides to take an entirely different approach to the traditional 'Star Wars' starter. He opens in space, obviously, with an attack on a rebel base (that's enough of that). He slowly introduces us to main characters Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac, rewarded here with a longer screen-time and a brilliant performance), General Leia (Carrie Fisher, taking command of the rebel base and getting more than just a cameo), Rey (stranded on a lonely planet), and with her of course, Luke (he just wants to be left alone). Further mention goes to a stronger Finn (John Boyega), who shares incredible chemistry with engineer Rose (a fantastic Kelly Marie Tran). On the Dark Side; there's a promising return of Adam Driver's Kylo Ren, showing to be beyond that angsty child-like behavior which dawned on his performance the first time around, and joined by his trusty right-hand man, General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson, not shouting as much). They come complete with their adviser, Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis looking much more intimidating in person). So as you can see Episode VIII is fairly packed with characters, but at a whopping 152 minutes they each get their fair share of the screen, with Johnson not leaving anything amiss.The film's predecessor was entirely Han Solo's movie until it ended after a horrible fate, which still brings a lump to our throats. This time round the stage belongs to Luke, whom at first wants to be left in peace but is soon changed by a persistent Rey, and thankfully through every moment Hamill is on screen he delivers with his best performance in years. It truly is a gift of a role he's been given here, and it shows that even after two more years out of the Jedi limelight the role still fits him like a glove. Of course you have to credit Johnson too. After working with Bruce Willis on his previous sci-fi venture, Looper, he clearly knows how to handle older actors.Though Johnson doesn't just deserve that credit. He makes 'The Last Jedi' a purely cinematic pleasure; his ability to bring every scene to life with colour and the angles he reaches are way further than previous entries. He's not afraid to introduce new techniques to the saga, yet as a writer he's clever at showing a clear understanding of the typical 'Star Wars' dialogue. Previously, J.J. Abrams, along with several other writers, would add a little humour on the side. Here, Johnson's techniques at writing are a little slapdash with the addition of a little more humour, though when it's serious it's bolder, darker and more heartbreaking than the previous time round. As a director he's truly daring as he explores different camera techniques. Abrams would use techniques where he made the villains look more menacing than they were, and often it would work. Johnson scraps that procedure and creates his own angles. He gets in close to the saber action...a close-up of Ren's fiery saber, and a brutal saber kill are things never seen in a 'Star Wars' film before.The force isn't fully strong with 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi'. In the middle section when the film takes a break from the action the story meanders and sadly suffers from this, but thankfully it is saved by Finn and Rose's incredible chemistry. And Johnson clearly knows what he's doing here as he makes Episode VIII a fitting addition to the nine film saga, showing daring techniques and an incredible hand in writing. It's definitely a match for the fans and one that shouldn't go amiss. And finally, it shows as a fitting memorial piece to Carrie Fisher.VERDICT: Episode VIII is a dark, earnest, often fun and sometimes heartbreaking addition to the 'Star Wars' saga, one that measures well in the eyes of fans and certainly one that shouldn't be missed.",8,7,27,14 December 2017
Jurassic World," Do you think he saur-us?
",This review is going to be completely spoiler free. Jurassic World is full of giants and what I mean by that is giant dinosaurs. Jurassic World is set 22 years after Jurassic Park and in this film they have genetically modified dinosaurs which makes them intelligent. Let me tell you what is good about this film (spoiler free).The film is very pretty and futuristic and it is filled to the brim with CGI. The film has some funny moments that just make you giggle. The dinosaurs have feelings and also you get the sense of scale in this film. The story is set well and is definitely going to take over Jurassic Park 2 and 3 which were in my opinion just over the top and poor.Bad points about this film is the bad dialogue and also some very small plot holes and very awkward moments and in my opinion is quite dark and gory especially to the fact that it is a 12A (PG-13) but overall this is a dinosaur of a film.The story is set around two brothers aged around 17 and 12 Zach and Gray Mitchell (Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins) who go off to an island called Jurassic World they go there on a holiday set by their Aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) the two brothers have such a fun time then eventually it all goes wrong. Then the story goes to another character Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) who was in the Navy signed up for Jurassic World to train some raptors specifically four but again it goes wrong. Zach and Gray go off on their own adventure without their Aunt Claire they basically have their own responsibilities. Eventually the park get's overrun and everything just goes wrong. Now the hybrid dinosaur not the one seen on the Jurassic World is literally colossal over fifty feet long and she is extremely intelligent and smell people from a mile away but that is enough about that.Finally this film is spectacular. 10/10. A must see.,8,45,100,12 June 2015
Silence," Silence is the virtue
","This review of Silence is spoiler free**** (4/5)We don't know what Pope Francis thought of Silence when he attended the special premier at the Vatican but rumour is that he possibly gave it (4 out of 5 mitres at best) but may be that was the religious subject that reigns the strength of the film. Based on the late Shusaku Endo's 1965 novel Silence which also spawned an animated short in 1971 it pictures the tale of two priests who travel from Portugal to Japan to find Father Ferriera (Liam Neeson) who has somehow thought that the people of Japan could see the word of God, but without success. But when Father Garrpe and Father Rodriguez (Adam Driver, Andrew Garfield) receive the seemingly final letter from him they are given a quest to find him. They must enter Japan without seen, so when they are on the brink of constant danger from being caught by a Machiavellian Japanese man who thinks that he runs the country and thinks that he can scrape their faith. We also don't know what the novelist will think of this adaptation either but it seems that the decades Martin Scorsese spent trying to make this film it the final result is worth it. Though at points Scorsese isn't afraid of using torture among the residents of Japan who are put through some very harsh forces of torture, as we see images of men and women being burned at stakes, but also there are some men who devout the word of god they are tied to crucifixes for many days on end finally drown by high tide, though these gruesome images are essential stuff for setting up the story of the characters. But as Rodriguez and Garrpe are separated and sent to fend for themselves in different parts of the country to try and teach the other residents. Though the fate is clear for Garrpe but with Rodriguez its not so clear though there are points he seemingly gives up, thinks that the lord doesn't love him and just when it seems he is about to give his life away there is a scene when he looks into a stream and sees an image of himself as Jesus, so he forces himself to some extent to keep going. As Silence starts its stunning third act. It's here through a series of flashbacks that we see what the country did to Ferreira there is final chance for him and Rodriguez to sit done in conversation but as he is trying to convince that he isn't who he was Rodriguez looks to him as if his religion has been betrayed by him, and so he sees an end to his final hope and decides to declare his life to Japan and it's culture as he finally sees that he can't teach the country new things into the world of Christianity. Though the film does flag a little with it's length as it seems that some of the film is prolonged it shows that Scorsese can still create a masterpiece even at the age he is as he also manages to get Oscar-worthy performances out of Garfield and Driver. Despite the length and the fact that it feels a little slow at points Silence is a genius religious film, with stunning imagery that's gorgeous, strong with a hard hitting story that's utterly compelling. And it shows that his imagery of religion in the 1600s is as relevant today as it is pertinent. VERDICT: Yet another masterpiece from Scorsese, it may not be for everyone but Silence is a hard hitting with epic proportions and phenomenal Oscar-worthy performances. It's stunning to see, though sometimes cruel but it's powerful.",8,3,8,1 January 2017
Logan," He's a bloody animal
","This review of Logan is spoiler free**** (4/5)IF ONE COULD simply describe how old Wolverine the same way X-Men Origins: Wolverine showed it we would be here all day, describing different timelines from when he was born to when he had the adamantium enhancement. So we're just going to say that he is old, like really f*cking old, sure superpowers are one thing, but nobody ever said that he was impenetrable to tiredness, or said that he was invincible. Yes he can heal but now it takes a lot longer to heal his aged skin. In Logan Hugh Jackman's last time as the clawed mutant, he's tired, set six years after the sentinels killed thousands of mutants in X-Men: Days of Future Past we track Logan as a limo driver retired from the killing, having to look after another old codger, namely Patrick Stewart's Charles Xavier who now at 90 years-old is very frail, restricted to a wheelchair he barely remembers who he is, he has constant seizures that are more powerful than ever that can be stopped by medicine. He is spending retirement with his trusted friend, Caliban (Stephen Merchant), who's a mutant tracker he can sense a mutant from miles away, however he's always worried when Xavier has one of his seizures. It's here when Logan meets Laura (newcomer Dafne Keen), a mutant with extraordinary powers but also like Wolverine has a dark past this quickly comes to show, and essentially she uses her dark past to control her power. Logan soon sees that she is more powerful than he anticipated, using her two hand-claws to brutally attack oncoming killers. He has to travel cross-country to a paradise for mutants who the mute Laura, learned from a comic book Logan, is convinced that she made it up but he goes anyway lugging along tiredly through the roads. Director James Mangold's material showing the brutality of her past is powerful it shows that Wolverine isn't the only one with torture in his life. In addition he lives up to his promise by keeping the CGI to a minimum there's a slight ounce of CG here-and-there but compared to Marvel movies there's barely any. Mangold's technique here is not only in intricate detail of the character studies of Wolverine and Laura, but he's good with blood too the violence doesn't let up; sure there was violence in the previous X installments but nothing like this. There's splats of blood-and-guts everywhere it's sometimes unnerving, he Fs, he decapitates, he impales, and slashes - seemingly never-ending brutality here, Wolvie has been this bad-ass before in the other installments showing bloodless killings, but here we see the Wolverine we've been waiting for.However the film isn't perfect, there is a flaw in the second act the film slows it's momentum in a moment when Wolverine learns more about Laura, her abilities, her family, and her life learning what kind of person she is. Explaining a little slowly but all essential material to the third act as it picks up its pace again. It's here when the material gets a lot stronger, Logan now a lot more tired has to pull through one last fight against Holbrook's soft-speaking, yet brutal killing machine, it's here when Mangold inputs sentimentality as Wolvie is beginning to get weaker when his medicine wears off, he shows strength though but it's not enough going into the final few moments. Laura/X-23 fights alongside him with a team of child mutants, she shows strength too she has seen a lot in her young life and killing is the only thing she knows. There is a moment in the finale when you may let out a few tears when Logan, is on the edge he puts in the effort to stay up but it doesn't work. Mangold keeps this on a high, keeping up with the material from the previous two hours. Sure Logan isn't perfect but it is the best Wolverine has ever whet mistakes Mangold made with 2013s The Wolverine he cleared them up here. After nearly seventeen years and 9 X-Men movies (not including Deadpool) either playing as the main character or a cameo Jackman's Wolverine has been through a sh*tload of stories in the X-Men universe and this is no exception to his brutality. It's fair to say Jackman's final time as the Wolverine ends on an emotional high.VERDICT: A bloody brilliant Wolverine movie, it's brutal, action-packed and endlessly exciting, this is the best Wolverine has been in years.",8,2,7,1 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Avengers re-assemble.
","Avengers:Age of Ultron my just be the best film of 2015 it started off great with a lot of action. Why I think this is the best superhero sequel ever.Okay first thing this film is action packed there is a lot more action than the first one so basically the story is still there but the action literally takes over.Second thing is the Hulkbuster now you may be thinking is it as awesome as it looks on the trailer the answer is yes...it is a lot more awesome than on the trailer and plus that action sequence goes on for quite some time. Third thing Ultron now Ultron may have been toned down to how he was in the comics but in this film he is still as malevolent and vicious as ever but with limits obviously with it being PG-13. Ultron in this film is played by James Spader and he doesn't lack at all you can still tell that Ultron is one of the most dangerous villain The Avengers have ever faced. Fourth thing the plot the film this time doesn't rely too much on it's story it's more the action that builds the film obviously there is still a story and it's a very good one there are some bits where the film slows down for it but that is really what a superhero film is about especially generation, when we rely on origin stories in superhero films. Fifth and final thing does it feel like too much Disney? the answer for that question is no it doesn't see the first film really felt like it was too much Disney but in this film it's a lot darker than the first film because you see some of The Avengers literally feel pain. Plus the first film was more of a full on introduction to The Avengers and what they do. This film is far from Disney now and well in that case that's better I did love the first film too. If you are a superhero fan and loved Ultron in the comics then you are going to love him even more in the film. This film was worth every penny and I think that well mainly superhero fans should go see this movie don't wait for it to come out on DVD just go see because it is amazing and is far better than the first. 8/10 must see superhero film.",8,55,107,24 April 2015
Everest," A Mountainous Voyage
","This is my review for Everest the film about climbing Mount Everest in case you didn't know this review is spoiler free.Plot: Robert Hall was a mountaineer who went on the most dangerous voyage a man could take he decides to climb Everest, where the unexpected can happen the mountain really takes it's toll on the mountaineers.This heroic biopic can really play with your heart strings but not in all ways this film isn't what I thought it was but I enjoyed it. There is wonderful acting form the main cast member Jason Clark (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Terminator Genisys)who plays Robert Hall. There isn't really much character introduction but I think the film was trying to get to the best bits really fast, in other films I would hate that but didn't in this one.This film has quite a lot of stars in it Josh Brolin (Sicario), Jake Gylenhall (Southpaw), Sam Worthington (Avatar) and Michael Kelly (The Adjustment Burau. The lack of story of the characters is slightly annoying but you can get over that. I think this film should at least be mention in the Oscars in my opinion.Overall this is a very brave and enjoyable that needs a little more attention. 9/10 a mountain of a film, must watch.",9,2,5,7 November 2015
La La Land," City of Stars
","This review of La La Land is spoiler free ***** (5/5) A modern Hollywood film, about the glitz and glam of Hollywood with an addition of pure unadulterated joy is in very short supply in this crazy, sometimes nonsensical world both on and off the big screen. This is the short reason why the irresistible La La Land is so cherishable today. It's just as light on its feet as Fred Astaire and just as beautiful as Judy Garland. Sure enough, Whiplash was very intense especially with J.K Simmons' Terrance Fletcher screaming 'that's not my f**king tempo' every so often and throwing a chair at Miles Teller's head, La La Land is a little more bittersweet than that in its first half it's footloose (not 'Footloose') and fancy free buoyed by the catchy soundtrack such as 'City of Stars' which definitely deserves some awards recognition (thanks to the production team for coming up with that).Its part New York, New York, part The Umbrellas of Cherbourg with a little bit of Singin' in the Rain we can just imagine the sweet singing voice and quick footed dance moves of Gene Kelly running the streets of modern day LA, though it's a bigger-budgeted upgrade over writer/director Damien Chazelle's short Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench with more or less the same idea. The story is Mia (Emma Stone) an aspiring actress trying to make her life in Hollywood who soon learns that if you don't make it, the place will eat you up whole and use your bones as a toothpick, she meets with Seb (Ryan Gosling) a jazz pianist trying to become a famous musician. It's an incredible part of the story which is the definition of simplicity and initially as soon as the pair meets the chemistry is electric as sparks fly in every place both literally and figuratively. Whether they are singing to a jazz track or dancing on a hilltop to a Technicolour backdrop they are unfathomably a match made in heaven and almost inseparable.At one point, the two are walking through the modern streets of LA Seb is talking about his chances as a Jazz musician suddenly Mia states that she hates Jazz, so he teaches her that it is everything with his irresistible dance moves or playing A-Ha on a key-tar she learns to like his taste in music a bit more. When she gets the chance to star in a one-woman play the tension becomes unbearable between the two and they decide to go their separate ways, Mia's and Seb's career takes off on a high the two become famous and their life starts to go in different directions. Unfortunately there isn't much of a story which falls horribly flat in places due to some sadly misplaced Pulp Fiction-esque narration techniques but with the sound track, the dance moves and the electricity of the stage the message is clear that La La Land doesn't need much of a story. Despite the story falling flat in places, their chemistry is electric, the music is terrifically catchy, the dancing is irresistible and the awards-calibre performances keep the film on a high. La La Land will make you sing, dance and cheer if there is a musical you watch in 2017 make sure it's this one.VERDICT: Fast paced, very funny, audacious and beautiful Hollywood doesn't make this kind of film anymore truly an instant classic with a lot of heart it's the best movie of 2017 so far.10/10 stunning.",10,4,10,12 January 2017
Snowden," Hacking has a limit
","This review of Snowden is spoiler free*** (3/5)SOMETIMES IT SEEMS that the phrase 'too soon' doesn't apply and doesn't have a proper meaning when it comes to big-screen adaptations of politically charged global scandals. As it wasn't long ago that we got WikiLeaks' name-making Guantanamo Bay files, of Benedict Cumberbatch slipping on an extended Malfoy-esque wig for The Fifth Estate. And also Leonardo DiCaprio has already optioned an unpublished book on Volkswagen's 2015 co2 emissions cover-up. And now – only three years after Edward Snowden's NSA revelations – here comes director Oliver Stone's bold, rather ambitious and surprisingly thrilling relevant biopic of the government analyst-turned-whistle-blower for The Guardian. For years director Oliver Stone now 70 – was a cinematic sleeping giant who used to be known for creating the exceptional over-the-top war pick Platoon, but it seems he had his work cut out for him recently as his last film the not-so thrilling action/crime/thriller Savages seemed to have quite an extended reach as the filming ran away from him while creating that. In, Snowden we open in 2013, in a hotel in Hong Kong, with journalist Glenn Greenwald (Zachary Quinto) and documentarian Laura Poitras (Melissa Leo) as they nervously await for a special rendezvous with Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who arrives with an all manner of dirty secrets to spill about how he pulled of that superfluous scandal only a few months before. Next, we flashback to 2004, where Snowden is a medically discharged special forces recruit who washes up in the CIA's rather large cyber branch, and an intercut timeline helps thread a link that was much needed between the past and the present, hopping back and forth between Snowden's career and his twitchy current existence, hiding in his hotel room to get away from the people who are constantly chasing him. Though the time-jumps between these timelines may be simple but they are an effective narrative device for showing Snowden's former life as a pro-Dubya patriot – which adds to the emotional story heft of his dubious decision to reveal the Big Brother-ish extent of the US government's spying game. Unfortunately his global tour – encompassing governmental jobs in mainland America, Switzerland, Japan and Hawaii – can occasionally be sadly episodic which is a giant put off for the story as not much happens at the point. Though its essential stuff as it is just used as foregrounding of his tempestuous relationship with professional photographer girlfriend Lindsay (Shailene Woodley in her best performance ever) acts as a solid narrative spine which manages to keep the story held together and now casts Snowden as an alternative love story, something that's crucially needed for something like this. However it's not like this story is light on sweaty-palmed drama and provocative politics so there is plenty to enjoy. Late on, Stone expertly wrings extensive tension from little more than a loading bar and a hidden SD card. Although, some of the director's illustrative tools are occasionally blunt as there are points when the story goes a little schlocky and seems to run away with itself – as one of Snowden's first epiphanies concerns a supposedly inactive laptop camera filming a Muslim woman removing her traditional veil – his anger at the rapaciousness of post-9/11 surveillance comes out eloquently and is nicely detailed. To help the film even more Stone's assisted by an in-form starry cast, too. Woodley lights up every scene she is in with electrifying execution, Rhys Ifans sells his look as a quietly sinister father figure to Snowden and finally Gordon-Levitt grows into a performance that initially seems mild mannered as his world is changing around him. The real-life Edward Snowden, (two years younger than Levitt) is still an exile in Russia, and he was consulted heavily and a third act decision to show off this admittedly impressive access seems as rather ill-judged take for the director. In fact, there's a heavily pervading sense that potentially takes interesting avenues(Snowden's self-interest, with the consequences of his international fame) are ignored in favour of an overwhelmingly heroic, almost saintly, character arc. Though the film flags a little and doesn't rein as supreme as other films based on professional hackers (if you can call that a profession) Snowden is a capably delivered thriller that's as powerful as it is pertinent. VERDICT: Snowden is a bold, ambitious and sometimes risky tale about government agency whistle-blowers that bravely doesn't point out too many names or technically speaking doesn't point too many fingers, and pulls a rather thrilling thriller that's strong powerful enough to be potentially Oscar worthy. 6/10 not so supreme.",6,2,8,8 December 2016
Don't Breathe," Turning Blue
","This is my review of Don't Breathe (spoiler free)**** (4/5)Lately, there has been a cycle of home invasion movies having a vulnerable protagonist – for example the deaf heroine in Hush, the agoraphobic of Shut In (a.k.a Intruders) – turning the table on murderous, larcenous thugs. Don't Breathe takes a slightly different tack on this premise, focusing on three varied crooks – an unstable bad boy who provides all the jobs, Money (Daniel Zovatto) a girl who need money to escape her not-so-happy home life, Rocky (Jane Levy) and a basically decent guy with a crush (Dylan Minnette) – they all make the mistake of targeting a grizzly tough ex-combat soldier (Stephen Lang) as their last target. Although influenced by many home invasion movies clashing regular criminals trying to make an extra bit of money with a contemporary maniac (No One Live, The Neighbour, The Collector). Although having dashed off the competent, not-so-memorable Evil Dead remake, Uruguayan writer/director Fede Alvarez doesn't exactly go all-out to break new ground with this 'original' – but he demonstrate the understanding of how this sort of suspense picture works. Making revelations every ten minutes, but as the more perilous and extreme moments come in there is a genuine element of terror and a thrill that will be memorable for any audience. Through the 88 minutes it adds terror, thrills, suspense and a memorable antagonist who is a lot more proficient, and less vulnerable than the young crooks last thought.The scarce use of dialogue isn't exactly worth while as there isn't much to go on when it comes to character development (spoken term) but as the story goes on turns out we don't need it as the slow and creepy editing style adds to the dark feel of the film, as we are constantly on edge as the element of threat gets stronger. One of the editing styles adds a night vision shot at one point and zooms it in really close to one of the invaders, so as you see their scared face it will increase the tension that this story was already full of. So in terms of story its limited but certainly makes up for it, not really classed as a go-for-broke horror as there are a few jump scares not really taking over the sheer threat of having a blind combat proficient man chase after you. Although this could be shown as a message for home invaders. The story is filled with constant suspense as the three thieves try to escape the blind man's home, although what they don't expect is that the Blind Man already has a plan for the thieves. That gives the thieves an idea, but as the story goes on in the main set-up inside the house he's not as paranoid as they thought, in fact, far from it. As stated above the jump scares are limited kind of strong however the feeling of suspense adds to the scares. Filmed practically it shows there is no need for special effects pizazz as some horrors try adding to make the story scarier, however it really wasn't needed in this as this antagonist and the dark atmosphere add enough horror. Also the feeling of claustrophobia is shown as one of the characters is in a tight confined space in a moment which will have you constantly on edge just many other characters in movies that have to deal with tight spaces, this is more towards the terrifying denouement which we'll get to later. There is a sense of shock in one of the scenes as the thieves discover which they did not expect and it adds a sense of imprisonment which is the whole theme of the film, but when it gets to this bit it is a very memorable moment which the audience will remember until well after the credits roll. It shows prolonging sense of agony. All this including the thrill are all made the bit creepier with Roque Banos' foreboding score which will send a shiver right down your spine. Each time this adds the feeling of every time one or the other robbers has a chance to get away clean, something pulls them back whether they creak a floorboard or even break some glass the antagonist gets ever closer to catching you. Finally as we all know at the end of a horror film in this case home invasion film the terror gets more fast paced, but in this not only is the terror nearly taking over the entire film there are also some feel good bits. But also as we get closer to the end the last act subjects the girl to a ferocious, slobbering guard dog, a padded basement dungeon (with a suspension harness) and a shocking home medical procedure. Although Lang, is an underrated character best known for his good-guy-cum-villain-cum-hard-to-kill-guy in Avatar, he is a powerful, menacing presence that also manages a little bit of pathos as we start to feel sorry for him as he is the real victim because we learn that he has lost everything he knows/loves and he preaches that there is no God because he took away the things he knew, so essentially he has nobody and he just wants to be left alone that is the message that this sends.VERDICT: Alvarez gives full blown suspense, terror and darkness in an original escapee horror that will make you struggle for every last breath.8/10 terrifying.",8,4,8,9 September 2016
Sicario," Mexican Hit-man
","This is my review of the tense crime, thriller Sicario (spoiler free). Sicario which means 'hitman' in Spanish takes place in Mexico and the FBI go there to investigate some murders and kidnappings that have been happening throughout the country. There isn't really much of a story involved but that is what makes it good, now I will go through the good points of why I think this is the best action film of the year: 1. All star cast: an all star cast such as Emily Blunt, Bencio del Toro and Josh Brolin star in this film which is what makes a must because it's people you know.2. Good action scenes: In the film I think there are about 5 action scenes but they keep you on the edge of your seat with well timed tense points for example explosions.Sicario is a must watch film because it goes through a lot of police business and then you get the fun action scenes which are very bloody and glorious. It has great acting from all three main cast members. There are some slow points but you keep watching because then you learn about why they are after these criminals. All in all Sicario is a very intense crime thriller and a must watch 10/10 (highly recommended).",10,0,3,13 October 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," We Are Groot
","This review of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is spoiler free**** (4/5)THE MAIN WEAPON behind the first Guardians of the Galaxy was surprise. From the time of unveiling to the release it's fair to say Marvel knows how to keep our patience. Of course after release who knew that one of our new favourite groups of superheroes would be a former wrestler, a hyper-engineered Racoon with a will for people to hate him, an anthropomorphic 8-foot tall tree and a homicidal green lady? And the helmsman of the group is the fat guy from Parks and Recreation.But this, of course, didn't stop Marvel and they had another success on the hands, which became one of the highest grossing films of 2014 and be one of the best films in that same year. Writer-director James Gunn was happy that the film was a success and just to seal the deal and decided to return to ground-breaking form, with his highly anticipated, albeit, well-needed sequel to his space romp. And so, with this in mind and a little bit of egotistical annoyance, we were ready for the ride, it's here at last, and it's safe to say 'We are Groot.' Our minds are kept at ease, and the first hour to Gunn's sequel is a success from the moment of opening the audience are looking with an un-blinking eye. To open, we get our team of misfits all in one go ready for a fight as usual, there's Peter Quill (a.k.a Starlord) the only human of the group amped with his facemask and his trusty Sony Walkman, then there's Gamora (Saldana) with an insight to killing, Rocket Racoon (Cooper) the hyper-engineered rodent the let's say the comedian of the group who's always ready for a one-side banter aimed at his team, finally there's Drax the Destroyer after being bent on revenge in the film's predecessor is ready for another fight. Of course, it's not all tongue-and-cheek with this team there's a hidden message in them: that is family, what better way to show that they're a family than by shouting at each other? There's another path though behind the film's sass there's still the flare that keeps this team going whether they're tagging a place with Rocket's traps, planning on a fight and, well, in Peter's mind, dancing to some of his favourite tunes. Keen to find out where or who he came from he goes in search for that fatherly figure, thankfully that comes, namely with Kurt Russell's Ego, a multi millennia year old humanoid with one path to get to know his son. This bodes for the film for some time, until it hits a wall there's a flaw, for almost the entire second act GOTG2 is stagnate in a father-son reunion. It stays on this for quite some time, but thankfully due to some hilarious utterances, gnarly sass and teamwork the film stays together and never gets dull. Also there's a side to Russell that we have never seen before when he unleashes his ego. It's the third act that's the shiner, well for the most part it's actually the team who shine the brightest, for all their moments of shouting and threatening to break up their brotherly-sisterly friendship they stay together, during their most intense battle (which thanks to the effects team on the outside looks stunning. Even though Vol. 2 isn't perfect there's a shining light that bears down on us all and keeps the big grin from ear-to-ear and no matter how much the film stagnates it's still dare we say marvellous.VERDICT: Director Gunn returns to Ground-breaking in his highly anticipated albeit well-needed sequel to his far-out space romp, are the A-holes back? It's safe to say they are.",8,3,8,28 April 2017
The Shape of Water," An underwater masterpiece
","This review of The Shape of Water is spoiler free**** (4/5)FROM PAN'S LABYRINTH, through Hellboy, via The Devil's Backbone to Crimson Peak, throughout his filmography Mexican director Guillermo del Toro has always had a way with creating intricate storylines with a simple character you can route for from start to finish. He's always had a way of layering his stories like an onion; firstly there's the simple opening - this can be the lead character or the narration of the story. Secondly there's the development of the character. Then there's the technical stuff; what the film looks like, what kind of visuals there are and what the storytelling entails through the visuals. And lastly there's the intricate ending whether its open ended (the first Hellboy) or it's closed ended (most of his others). This, essentially has given the Mexican native a career that's unlike most other directors, plus he can't be the only director out there who makes fairytale romance and horror work. Previously it was his gothically enchanting creep-fest Crimson Peak, there he went the supernatural route when a woman fell in love with a ghost. With his latest The Shape of Water he has achieved something on the level of La La Land; here he has made a beautiful, delicious and truly magical love story, which is as much of a paean to the world of cinema as it is a visually stunning, beautifully shot love story. One that takes you on a mesmerising ride from start to finish. 
 
We start with the simple route in the story; Elisa (Hawkins) is a mute woman who makes her living, working as a late-night janitor at a secret government facility in Baltimore during the Cold War in the early 1960's. At first, she's isolated living in an apartment above a cinema, and the only person she has for company is her neighbour (Jenkins), a has-been advertising artist who is her friend and confidant if she ever feels lonely. Her life revolves around watching old musicals, however despite the war setting there's only a tiny glimpse of war on a TV screen, and that's pretty much it other than that image war never makes an introduction through this story. Like in his other films, and his well-rounded characters here he wants to keep reality firmly at the bay (or in this case the water). But reality isn't an option with del Toro, there's always something that takes his storytelling to a level above reality, and this one is no exception to his fairytale storytelling. Elisa's life is seemingly at a dead-end, constantly working the same shift until the scientists find a mysterious amphibious creature, which looks like a mutant experiment between that creature off The Black Lagoon and Hellboy's Abe Sapien, and she slowly starts to fall in love with the creature. 
 
And it's here where the story shows off its true blue-ish colour. Like Pan's Labyrinth before it, this one is visually stunning, it's beautifully shot (a stunning shot of the creature coming out of his pool doesn't go without a mention), its inertly sweet, warm-hearted and charming. Through every moment his story is absorbed by exceptional performances, however full praise here goes to Hawkins who dazzles as the mousy mute lead. Also like Labyrinth, The Shape of Water has its darker routes; here we have Michael Shannon playing as ruthless G-man Agent Strickland, who sees the creature as a freak that must be tamed right away. He does anything to see his asset get hurt in vicious ways, and does anything to stop his escape. 
 
Of course you have to credit del Toro's imagination who keeps the story strictly romantic (a standout shot of Elisa seducing the creature) and it truly works on that side up until the end. Sadly, The Shape of Water isn't as good as it should've been it doesn't thoroughly work throughout and as much as it's imaginative storytelling follows original spates, there are moments where the storytelling falls to repetition of del Toro's other fables. Still, the film is a truly enchanting, mesmerising and magical one, that won't be forgotten any time soon. 
 
VERDICT Stunning visuals and enchanting storytelling bring del Toro's heart-warming and charming adult fairytale romance to life thanks to a dazzling performance by Hawkins and excellent production design.",8,26,50,14 February 2018
Sausage Party," Fun Food
","This is my review of Sausage Party (spoiler free)**** (4/5)Cast: Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Michael Cera, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Bill Hader, Edward Norton, Salma Hayek, James Franco, Paul Rudd. Plot: Shopwell's supermarket is full of happy groceries, waiting to go to the 'Great Beyond'. But one day they discover evidence to suggest there is a much darker future in store for them.In the original Shrek, the Gingerbread Man is tortured by the malevolent Lord Farquaad. Dunked in milk with his legs ripped off, he's threatened with even worse bodily harm. 'No, not my buttons!' he squeals. 'Not my gumdrop buttons!' It's apt that Conrad Vernon, the man who both created and voiced 'Gingy', is also one of the directors of Sausage Party. Because, like the scene described above which is arguably the most violent that movie can get apart from the beer fight. This unlikeliest of summer-season animations is a weird hybrid of cutesy cartoon and horror flick, a tale in which awful things happen to sentient food products. It may be a weird hybrid between the two but it's both very very rude but very very funny in its use of random rudeness but that particular influx of randomness pulls through in what could be the greatest animation ever. It's arguably an intended spoof for the creators of Superbad Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen to make a mockery of all the animations that they love/loved as either children or adults. Our hero Frank (Rogen) who has unimaginable feelings for his bun-friend Brenda (Wiig, on top form once again, and also more confident than ever) and he shares his packaging with Barry (Cera, in his bravest role ever), and Carl (Hill, in possibly his shortest role ever as he doesn't last very long) see that life in the supermarket isn't quite what it seems, as Frank goes off in search for the truth. There is one point in this cutesy animation that makes it a creepy horror flick, because this also uses violence not the slapstick you normally get in films like this but guts out violence, in what could be described as the most violent scene in any animation ever. Beyond all the Pixar-like feelings this film will give it is nowhere near child friendly but with its charm and vulgarity it shows that adults can love animation too. What if the premise of a film like Toy Story, in which inanimate objects come to terms with the meaning of their existence, was pushed to its logical dark-as-hell conclusion? There is an increasing amount of glee in Sausage Party (a tale about pork that is more sex-obsessed than Porky's) as it heads towards its demented denouement. Brought to life by sub-Pixar but decent CGI, as it bustles with anthropomorphic edibles. There is a tomato voiced by Rudd, a sultry taco with the tones of Salma Hayek and even a Hitler-esque sauerkraut shouting 'exterminate the juice.' In case how man food based puns there are; the answer is a lot. At first though it seems that, that is all this seems to offer, with enough raunch to make a beetroot blush. Gradually, though, this reveals itself to be a bold piece of work with some rather big ideas. The return of a panicked jar of honey mustard (Danny McBride) to the store, raving about the abuse meted out to food items by humans, triggers an existential quest for Frank to go on and he goes to extreme lengths (pun intended) to search for the truth. There is a concept of organized religion that is explored, as the lone sausage tries to convince his blissed-out companions they not be headed for a glorious after life, but rather a knife-assisted oblivion. Even the Israel/Palestine conflict is riffed upon, through the unlikely medium of a relationship between a lavish (David Krumholtz) and a bagel (Edward Norton, doing a big, goofy impression of Woody Allen and just about stealing the show). There are smarts to Sausage Party that are well-concealed between layers of utter filth, which ramps up and up until a late set-piece that will likely make you choke with laughter: think Caligula re-enacted by condiments. Bringing to mind a go-for-broke vibe of South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, the final reel unleashes debauchery and mayhem of a kind that makes you wonder if a studio exec ever checked in on the production. There are some barren bits – there is a villain that is an actual douche (Nick Kroll) who's more loud than funny, and some of the gags have the feeling that the writers got them from a box of Christmas crackers – but Rogen and Goldberg have succeeded in cooking up something truly original. Also in its incredibly short run time it delivers laughs out the whazoo, rudeness and food related violence and sex. The finale, meanwhile, suggests yet another Meta sequel could be on its way. It leaves us to believe what these sausages could get up to next. You may even forgive it for being incredibly short. It's nice to see Seth Rogen on top form once again.Verdict: It sounded like the dumbest movie of all time, but it's actually smart, subversive and packed with famous voice, saying wonderfully unspeakable things.

12 Strong," Moderately strong
","This review of 12 Strong is spoiler free*** (3/5)BRAVERY, POWER AND strength take their hold through the plot of Jerry Bruckheimer's produced true telling war drama 12 Strong, based on the alleged declassified mission when CIA Paramilitants and American Special Forces would join forces and invade Afghanistan after the events of 9/11 to kill the Taliban. 
 
However those points aren't just the central nail for the plot, they're also what carries the film through its pulsating action. Sure this idea is often clankingly direct as the film progresses, yet it gives a scent of the decent layout through its 130 minute running time. However, despite the robustly delivered action and an interesting big-name cast helming it, this core idea sadly falls to the straightforward storytelling of patriotic heroism and a weak script which often has it's actors talking through bombastic poster taglines and not really much else. 
 
Saying that though, there's obviously a reason why Bruckheimer attached himself to the film, maybe it's the core material based on Doug Stanton's novel 12 Horses, or perhaps it's the bravery of a dirty dozen who take a chance and fight back - it could also be the chance to do something other than the recently botched plotting of the Pirates of the Caribbean series. It could, in fact, be all of them that gained his attraction, the attraction of Danish first-time director Nicolai Fuglsig and the talented cast. Chris Hemsworth (taking a break from the MCU) plays Captain Mitch Nelson, a man with limited combat experience, who's mostly bunged-up behind a desk, he and his trusty lieutenant (Michael Shannon) are given the task to fight in Afghanistan where they'll be tied with their foreign general (Navid Negahban). 
 
While the sandy dozen tour through the gorgeous desert backdrop, there are a few Sergio Leone-ish action scenes - of horse, guns, tanks and giant explosions clashing together. It's an entertaining war-drama which has keen intentions happily carried through its core performances - sadly the action, though stunning, especially with an explosion taking up half the screen, it isn't anything we haven't already seen before. And it's that thinking where the action often falls to repetition, it's almost as if the editor left during production and recycled the same material. 
 
Still, that said, 12 Strong boasts stunning cinematography, a big name producer and a hefty cast all with brilliant performances there's even a surprise dramatic turn by Rob Riggle. All are big with their intentions to grasp the powerful premise and to grasp the true intentions of bravery from the core material - yet the truth is the film sadly loses another point for lacking in characterization. Indeed it has problems through its forgettable plot it's an entirely brazen film that comes with power, the determination of odds and a strong heart. 
 
VERDICT Invigorating action and a solid cast lead in this fact-based war film that sadly loses its way from limited character a soft core and an underwhelming story.",6,0,4,26 January 2018
Kong: Skull Island," He's back...only just
","This review of Kong: Skull Island is spoiler free *** (3/5) LIKE HIS Japanese counterpart, King Kong has entered the world of cinema, left it and been resurrected an uncanny amount of times, however only a few of them explored the inner reaches of his uncharted home the mythical Skull Island. But it's been over a decade since he was last brought to life, and although 2005s King Kong did go to the island it didn't explore it the way we would have liked, it had the plot to find Kong and capture him to show him to the world and then he raided New York, you know it. In Kong: Skull Island we explore the inner reaches of the island, and are constantly threatened by the giant beast, for which Samuel L. Jackson's war-hammered soldier here asks 'How big is it? How fast is it? And what it do?' Of course how big he is and how he is, is obvious to those who are familiar with the monster, his speeds vary through different films. Yet with the advantages of CGI only coming in before 2005s version he went as fast as the computer would take him, although in that version he was played by Andy Serkis in motion capture. Here he's only seen in CGI visuals roaring from sound effects, and looking more dazzlingly like an ape than ever. His facial features looking more real, and his height even more terrifying here he's about the size of other monsters beside him.This is the second film in Legendary Entertainment's MonsterVerse series; the first was 2014s Godzilla directed by Gareth Edwards, who thanks to his special effects team made the beast look more real than it ever did, but also gave him extra height, it's too hard to imagine how big they'll in their next fight. Although now Kong is noticeably smaller (at around 104 meters) but he's still growing as the film tells us but he can still pack one hell of a punch when he needs to. Were as Godzilla is full sized, he probably has the advantage over the giant ape but we won't know until the next film Godzilla: The King of Monsters comes out. But for now Kong: Skull Island makes its debut reigning supreme on his home turf, where it's dangerous by day but even more dangerous by night, as a lot of the island's inhabitants are there to kill its human invaders. Some more terrifying than others.Next to Kong, on the island there are some horrific looking beasts with nasty teeth, really quite dinosaur looking, some can fly, some have horns and giant some are creepy crawlers, as the humans soon find out. However they don't help Kong, he isn't the most dangerous, and he's the protector of the island's native human inhabitants. There is something trying to kill him, in addition there is emotional heft to this story, too when it explains that Kong is the last of his kind proving to Jackson's hardened soldier that animals, even giant ones have feelings too, and he has the feeling of anger when the unwanted guests try to destroy his home, there is a gorgeous shot of the primate's fist colliding with the helicopters that he's scared of. Of course he has to be scared of something.On land, the human invaders recover from the attack here Jackson angrier than ever, decides that Kong is the threat and wants to fight against him, but others try to get him change his mind about the war. The group of men and women include: Tom Huddleston's hardened tracker James Conrad, who hired by Bill Randa (Goodman) explores the island in search for evidence as to why evolution comes to an end, he lists the ways they are going to die on an uncharted island leaving one specific note (the giant monsters). Brie Larson's anti-war photographer Mason Weaver she takes an immediate liking to Kong and wonders why the other creatures want to kill him, and end the human territories on the island. Later, they meet with Hank Marlow (Reilly), a World War II soldier who's been stranded on the island since 1944 he steals the show from the rest of the players. Unfortunately he's the only one with character in the film, the rest of the characters are bland, even a talented actor like Hiddleston is wasted here. Sure he makes a decent impact with his bad-ass moments in a bar fight and sword swinging through dinosaur birds but it's not much.This is perhaps the main flaw of the film, granted it looks gorgeous but the characters are dreary with a non-characterizing screenplay, yes there are flaws but there goodness here, too, the action is stunning it's the monsters that have the bigger impact, or in Kong's case has the bigger punch. When goes to punch helicopter of the sky it looks gorgeous as he's surrounded by smoke and fire. In the third act the action hits its peak, when he has to fight a giant creature that matches him to save the humans. Despite the horrendous flaws, like the bland screenplay Kong: Skull Island is a jaunty film with goodness and although it's not the best monster film it's still enjoyable, let's see how far he'll go in the future.VERDICT: King Kong is alive again! Only just, in this derivative, dumb but consistently fun latest addition to the MonsterVerse series. It's just about over the line of Godzilla's strength, but not by much.",6,4,9,9 March 2017
Finding Dory," Adoryble
","This is my review of Finding Dory (spoiler free) ***** (5/5) Cast: Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brookes, Ed O'Neill, Kailtlin Olson, Hayden Rolence Plot: The friendly-but-forgetful blue tang fish reunites with her loved ones, and everyone learns a few things about the real meaning of family along the way.Let's spare a thought for the bazillionaires at Pixar and duty they have done to make marvelous masterpieces, also the amount of Oscars they have won over the past 20+ years. Finding is just one of the many sequels to come over the next few years like Toy Story 4 (2018 was 2017) and Cars 3 (2017), this isn't like the Monsters Inc. sequel that wasn't really a sequel and also wasn't very good. This however even though it is set 1 year after Nemo gets his father but really that was 13 years ago. It isn't often that Pixar make flops unlike last year's The Good Dinosaur but other than that not many Pixar are just one of the few film companies to actually make brilliant films.We all know who Dory is at this point she is a blue tang fish with a little bit of a curse she forgets everything and it's not her fault but we go along with it anyway and she has grown in popularity ever since Andrew Stanton's Finding Nemo came out, for some the director wanted to take a spin on live-action so then he made John Carter back in 2012, which saw a huge drop in the box office. The first we see on the screen is Dory living alongside Marlin (Brookes who is still as stern as ever) and Nemo (Newcomer Hayden Rolence) who is outstanding as Nemo but not as good the previous Nemo, played by Alexander Gould now 22 years old. Dory lives alongside their vicious anemone (such a hard word to say) Dory has dream of remembering her family in her mixed up way. As usual DeGeneres was an excellent choice for Dory, so then we see that dream of when she was a baby when you see baby Dory it will just make you go 'awww' at how cute she is because she is adoryble. That dream sequence along with many other sequences in the film is one of the best.Off she goes to find her parents and even with a few flashbacks along the way, she meets all sorts of new characters in the film and they are all amazing in their own way, the friend she keeps for some time is an angry cephalopod Hank voiced brilliantly by Ed O'Neill he helps her find her family and the story just plays beautifully from there, She also thinks of a new creature for Hank she calls him a Septopus because he has lost one tentacle, the two get along so well and is another list of lovable creatures for you add to the Pixar list which might be getting a bit full at the moment.Not only doe you see the film from Dory's point of view but also Marlin and Nemo's point of view. From then on of course there are a few silly moments which is to be expected the most silly part which you will probably laugh at, are the lazy Sea-lions Flubber and Rudder resting on a rock voiced by the wonderful Idris Elba who has changed his way from playing Shere Khan in Jungle Book (2016) he and his friend Rudder (Dominic West) are just wonderful and they change the story so much.Other characters she meets are Destiny and Bailey (Kaitlin Olson and Ty Burrell) they are to whales that she meets and conveniently Dory helps Destiny to swim and as for the criticizing Bailey who isn't much help at all is always bring her down, these two characters are just charming and lovable everything they do just makes the story a whole lot more to watch and to enjoy. Throughout this Pixar sequel you're never bored and it doesn't suffer the fate as many other sequelitis in fact this is just as good as Finding Nemo way back in 2003 which only if you a teenager in your late teens you will remember Nemo, and the brilliance that, that was back then.Dory finally sees her family again voiced by the remarkable Eugene Levy and Diane Keaton, then of course she has to save the day again and this possibly is the most human Pixar sequel ever and when it ends you'll clapping your hands and begging for an encore. Pixar is back and it's here to stay.Verdict: An adoryble sequel with plenty of charm and lovable characters another masterpiece from the geniuses at Pixar, well done guys. Oscars 2017 anyone? 10/10 a charming delight.",6,5,22,29 July 2016
Parasite," Parasites linger
","Parasite, is a hard film to discuss, not because it's one of those films that is truly horrendous but genuinely its a hard film to talk about because its one those where you cant do your research, or where you can see any trailers because they would most likely spoil the outcome. The hard truth is, you have to go into it completely blind, because its one those films that can surprise you at any turn, essentially there are no words to describe this superb South Korean thriller but simply it's director: Bong Joon-ho.This is pure Bong, it's insane, if you were to put it into one single genre you would a very hard to find trying to find which genre it would slot into, is it a horror? A thriller? A crime-caper? A comedy? Or is it just a drama? It's all of them, and none of them at the same time. But in a way in that sense that's the way that Bong creates his cinema, just for him, the man has no one genre he has not one single technique in his directing style. From his first film in 2000 Barking Dogs Never Bite, to Memories of Murder, through his monster invasion flick The Host, Snowpiercer and there's even no way to describe his last film Netflix's Okja they are all him. And his seventh film Parasite goes completely crazy in fact we're not sure if it's trying to be a meticulous crowd-pleaser or a mindbending thriller or an Art-house caper. The point is where he is trying to go he does it successfully. From the opening reel it'll have you intrigued and it scratch you out until you are unwillingly bridled to watch it again and again...And why shouldn't you? It's perfect - the plot is watertight, the Kim family are poor and penniless and utterly hopeless, they are getting tired of their stingy underground basement apartment so the eldest son (Woo-shik) seeks out other opportunity besides living in squalor conditions. So he has a plan to work for the wealthy Park family in their stunning mansion, liking what he sees he decides to bring the rest of his family along for the ride, and for a while everything is going fine until the rise of an unfortunate incident. And that's when everything changes. Intrigued? Well, that's enough. Because when it comes to Bong it's not the story that matters its the way his characters are written, the way they delve into making new plans for the well-off Park family. No. What the story is a about, is family. Now we know what you're going to say, and you can refrain from that because this is the exact opposite, it's about a family who have nothing, then they go into everything and then they think they're doing fine until they slip. And that could result in a lot of things going wrong. For the first hour during the different plans you could essentially say that this is another version of The Italian Job minus the cars and Michael Caine or perhaps a mixture between Ocean's and Rififi and you'd be write it's all those. And much more, there's no knowing how many references to old films Bong has put here. But what he does in that first hour is absolutely captivating and the execution of the plans is one-of-a-kind cinema. It's a film that doesn't that doesn't really sound like it works, but it does. And here Bong has created a miracle of a film.Joyously it couldn't have come at a better time, amidst all the modern cinema redos, remakes and been-there-done-that sequels this is a real miracle and Bong has a real gem on his hands. Plus naturally in crime caper when people get found out they lose everything, here there's no evidence of that, maybe (but remember no spoilers) but the Kims they just keep going until they have ruined enough of the Park family's well being. There's a moment of a threat of being caught but with eager hands they soon put a stop to that. The fact is Bong does nothing wrong here, Parasite is a perfect, water-tight and captivating thriller that will put your heart on edge, make you scratch your head and finally make wonder if cinema can get any better. No is the answer, and Bong could not have made it a better time as it will keep you going to the end reel and refuse to let go even well after the credits roll. He's essentially the Korean version of the Coen brothers, and there's no better compliment than that.VERDICT: Bong has made a miracle of a film that's a water-tight crime caper, thriller and dram a plus many more genres all in one film. And with an unforgettable story it will keep you watching for years to come. Truly cinema at its best.",10,3,4,14 February 2020
Wonder Woman," Wonderful Woman
","This review of Wonder Woman is spoiler free**** (4/5)THERE'S A SAYING, a metaphor perhaps that states if a series or a distributor starts with a few false starts in previous instalments then the hype for the next instalment will dwindle, this, of course is true for other series' of films but for the DCEU it clearly isn't. There have been a few false starts for the series, Man of Steel didn't live to expectation nor Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice wasn't as good as was previously thought then Suicide Squad fell into the world of shame rather than live up to what it said on the tin. It seem the DCEU was in need of a saviour, at first this saviour came from a meme â€“ this had a bruised Batman and tired Superman fighting in an endless war, then beyond that shadow stands Gal Gadot's Diana â€“ perhaps the saviour of BvS. After Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman the metaphor loses its sight, and goes into turmoil, in the opening few minutes there's colour, a narration that explains the comings of war between gods and humans and a young Diana Prince (exceptional work from youngster Lilly Aspell) willing to train for a coming war. Her mother (Robin Wright) explains that there is no need to do this â€“ after this the origin of the princess progresses to when she is all grown up and has become a trained warrior. The opening origin story is exceptional there's a lot colour which we haven't seen in previous instalments, there's stunning story narration and a wonderful shot of Gadot's Diana training with her auntie (Connie Nielsen) the best fighter on the island. An island inhabited by women until a manly presence invades their homeland enter American spy Captain Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), he speaks of an ongoing war in the outer world. When he's teamed with Gadot their chemistry is magnificent these two work well together and prove to be the dynamic that we need. Pine is exceptional as Steve, he's funny, he's handsome, and he's a charmer who does anything to please our heroine. Diana who's never seen a man before is wonderful to behold especially when she tells Steve about where she comes from. She wants to go with him to go fight the ongoing war â€“ meanwhile villainous doctor, Dr. Poison (Elana Anaya) and her warmongering companion Ludendorff (Danny Huston) design dangerous weapons to outfit their soldiers. It's a wonderful story of war and super heroism a mach that never made a keen pairing before but now-a-days it works. It's dark but constantly dark and brooding as the previous films, something that the earlier DCEU intended to rely on Wonder Woman proves that you don't need to be dark to be good. And she does her job well, as Diana Gadot is fantastic she's a beautiful princess who loves the world of men and believes that life has a meaning, as her stronger alter ego she's exceptional, she's strong but on the inside she's vulnerable, unlike the caped crusaders or the men of steel she's not afraid to show emotion and the other wonder woman helming her director Jenkins shows this with exquisite style. Diana was the saviour in BvS, here she proves to be the saviour again who takes no BS. And Jenkins proves that a DC movie can have style too â€“ she adds a lot of elements here that makes this super-human feel more human as said she adds emotion there are other elements too the vulnerability makes her a more connectable superhero it proves strength in the female superhero line. Sadly it's not wonderful, in the last 20 minutes it hits a clichÃ© cg barrier that other superhero movies seem to rely on now-a-days, there are some moments that look they're made from green screen and sadly doesn't make it as good as it could've been. Other than that everything here delivers exceptionally well Jenkins proves that could teach the caped crusaders or men of steel a thing or two with this instalment, it's she's brought new light to the DCEU and it's about damn time.VERDICT: After a few false starts to the DCEU it finally has a success in fantastic style that hits punches with brilliant execution and fabulous performances this is perhaps the best instalment to the DCEU ever, now we can breathe again.",8,28,58,1 June 2017
Black Panther," The MCU has cat-like reflexes.
","This review of Black Panther is spoiler free**** (4/5)WITH ONLY A few films to his name director Ryan Coogler has taken a real turn in the world of cinema, first was tough-bearing directorial debut Fruitvale Station which was only a small indie project but after that it didn't take long for his name to be on the map, it was, inevitably a few years later when he made his second feature Creed (Rocky 7) where the illigitimate son of the late Apollo Creed would take his turn in the boxing world, and finally his third and latest film Black Panther is his chance at a big budget feature. However not only black power a main symbol in his features there's only one actor who has collaborated with the director in every one of his films; Michael B. Jordan. 
 
Black Panther opens not long after the death of his father King T'Chalka, which would then conjure up his revenge in Captain America: Civil War. Here he has swapped from being a supporting player to being the main feature, he's just about to be crowned King of Wakanda, the fictional African nation which has made an occasional entry in other MCU movies. For the ceremony he has to take on a challenger in gladiator-style combat, there's African-drum music in the air and the Wakandan natives are chanting to the beat. This is an important scene, one that changes the world of cinema in an excellent way, granted on occasion there have been a few films that make a few homages to a homely place, for example 2009's Avatar had the main character going to meet other tribes and there would be different design's to their clothing. Coogler follows that same insight. Like Taika Waititi before him who paid energetic homage to his home of New Zealand by adding his Antipodean style humour in Thor: Ragnarok, here Coogler is the polar opposite, he swaps the humour for the colour of the country and their natives who dress in African-style colours from bright reds, through yellows to the bright greens, even through the Africani accessories. Coogler's attention to the detail is exquisite. With that in mind, it's also an important film one that shows how much 21st century has changed and you could argue that it's for the better. After becoming king, T'challa (Chadwick Boseman) has to face his biggest challenge, to protect his country against the invasion of a former soldier with a mysterious past Jordan's Erik Killmonger (which sounds like a gaming profile), who wants to overthrow the king. So that's your average Marvel movie storytelling right there. However, Coogler doesn't make it the average Marvel film apart from his exquisite hand in the Africani detail, it's perhaps the most visually stunning comic-book movie, and the Panther's suit changing colour, the sand-like holograms and the amazing cityscape which shines thanks to Rachel Morrison's gorgeous cinematography. 
 
There's so much good in Black Panther, excellent action, stunning visuals, gorgeous cinematography and a director who pays an energetic homage to Africa, but the real standing point here is the female characters, from Danai Gurira, through Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o to T'challa's mother played by Angela Bassett. Who all put in excellent performances along with another standout performance by recent award's darling Daniel Kaluuya. Boseman and Jordan are excellent too, but here they're made into supporting players by these brilliant performers. In short, Coogler's go at the MCU and his third feature is a brilliant entry to his growing filmography one that takes an important scratch in cinema.
 
VERDICT Like Waititi before him Coogler pays energetic homage to his past life in the MCU's latest super extravaganza.",8,46,139,13 February 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Welcome to the League of Justice
","This is my review of Batman V Superman (spoiler free).Director: Zack Snyder Cast: Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Jesse Eisenberg, Gal Gadot, Jeremy Irons.Plot: Fearing the actions of Superman are left unchecked, Batman takes on the man of steel, while the world wrestles with what kind of a hero it really needs.Director Zack Snyder returns with the explosive sequel to Man of Steel (2013) and this time we see Batman and Superman fight to the death.The film has a very dark vibe to it and certainly welcomes the new era of Batman in very action addition to DC Cinematic Universe. Here are some points on why I think this film is a must see: Action: Obviously this is a superhero and there is always one thing that makes a superhero film better and that is action and a lot of it. This film is exactly that it is explosive and among everything else it is loud and edge of your seat madness. One more thing the action has the use of momentum rarely seen in action movies.Lighting Effects: The film has the same lighting effects as Man of Steel with gigantic lens flares it just makes the impact of the film look more real, it also has an amazing use of dark and light shading.CGI: The CGI is mind-boggling and it makes the atmosphere of the whole feel like you are actually there alongside the two biggest heroes in comic book history. My favourite bit about the CGI is that Doomsday looks really scary and very convincing.On the negative side the jokes and references are funny at the start but then they begin to feel a little too much and a few of them wouldn't have gone amiss. Gal Gadot's acting as the Amazonian Goddess Wonder Woman is beyond atrocious I mean it's the first time that she has appeared on the big screen but she could have been done better.If you liked Man of Steel and you like Batman or you just want to see them try to kill each other then this film is worth, even though that Ben Affleck is mediocre as Batman. I recommend this film to all DC fans.Verdict: Action packed and a lot of fun it makes the wait worth while although some of the jokes shouldn't have been there. 8/10 explosive recommendation.",6,1,2,25 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force has Awakened
","This is my review for Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens (spoiler free).This film delivers well to fans of all ages and is the sequel fans have been waiting for, for 32 years. With amazing dialogue and explosive special effects I promise that when you leave the theater you won't be disappointed. Let's start with some the good points of why I think this is the film of the year: 1. Characters: This film has some new characters like Finn (John Boyega), Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) these characters deliver the plot of the film well along with some the older characters like Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chebacca and C-3PO.2. Plot: This films plot follows the plot form Episode VI Return of the Jedi and is a very good continuation to the story.3. Special Effects: The special effects are explosive and are a key element to the film to make this a hell of a sci-fi epic.Those are the good points on why I think you should watch this film and the bad points well there are none because this film was enjoyable from beginning to end. I think that the force has truly awakened in this film but that's for you to judge. If you are a Star Wars fan old or new this film should be at the top of your list. 10/10 an excellent must see bring on Dec 2017 for Episode VIII. Must see.",8,17,51,19 December 2015
Deadpool," The Master of the Mercenaries
","This is my review for Deadpool (spoiler free).If you don't know who Deadpool is, he is a wisecracking mercenary named Wade Wilson who is very aware he is in a comic book. Ryan Reynolds is perfect for the role of the merc with a mouth, under the direction of newbie director Tim Miller this is the film that Deadpool have been waiting for.Cast: Ryan Reynolds, Ed Skrein, Morena Baccarin and T.J Miller.Plot: A former Special Forces operative turned mercenary is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, adopting the alter ego Deadpool. It's an origin story and a very good one.This hilarious action comedy is filled with funny wisecracking jokes that will leave you crying with laughter probably every five minutes, among the hilarity there are ultra-violent action scenes with wisecracking jokes.Let me go through some points of why I think this is the Marvel film to see this year:Violent action scenes: The strong bloody violence makes this the perfect Deadpool film for any Marvel fan. What else can I say about that?Fourth-wall breaking: The joy doesn't stop there with the action and sex references there is also amazing fourth-wall breaking that is just relentless. The film certainly delivers even from it's meager $50 million production budget certainly less than other Marvel movies. This is Ryan Reynolds at his best he is perfect for the role as the Canadian anti-hero, it's certainly a lot better than 2011's Green Lantern starring the same actor.Tim Miller made this film well and will probably go down in history as one of the best Marvel films all time. This action packed comedy is rude, funny and full of violence in my opinion this is by far the best film of 2016 so far, and I recommend it to everyone. Seriously you will endlessly be laughing with joy. 10/10 is not enough of a rating for this film. Must see. Can't wait for the director's cut later this year.",8,4,15,10 February 2016
John Wick: Chapter 2," He's Bloody Back
","This review of John Wick: Chapter 2 is spoiler free**** (4/5)THERE HAVE BEEN a lot of roles that Keanu Reeves has played since hanging up his sunglasses, long leather coat and his boots after 2003s The Matrix: Revolutions. Many of which were promisingly good, some were quite bad and others in-between were mediocre to say the least. But out of all these characters he's been in none that have fit him more like a glove than the title character in 2014s John Wick, the hirsute assassin who was enjoying life in retirement with his new puppy, until he had to get revenge etc. The film spawned a whole new genre of action: the geriaction thriller (cheekily, Reeves was just about to turn 50 at the time he couldn't be considered as a geriatric) because at the time there were a few other films with older protagonists sharing the multiplex, such as Denzel Washington in The Equalizer, Kevin Costner in 3 Days to Kill and the granddaddy of them all Liam Neeson in Taken 3. Even though he was a lot older than he was in the first Matrix he did a bloody (emphasis high on bloody) good job at ass-kicking, or sharp shooting criminals out of his home. He ended up killing a lot of people, there was a lot of action to enjoy. At this point you may be asking yourself what's on offer the second time-round? From the start of John Wick: Chapter 2 there is a lot to take in we are immediately transferred into a car chase it's indeed the main improvement over its predecessor which didn't have much of a story, there was just a lot of action a huge body count and a lot of blood a simple dog revenge thriller. For a while through this it riffs the same thing, there is a lot of action, a lot of blood and a huge body count – there are, however, two differences, an entirely new plot which riffs on an entirely new revenge story this time it's Wick's life on the line after he entered in a wager with a ruthless killer (Riccardo Scamarcio) and the dog (a Staffie with no name). The title Chapter 2, also indicates there will be a larger series to behold here seemingly perhaps he may come back for the third movie (if it happens) we'll see. Director Chad Stahelski's material here is - in one word spectacular there is plenty here to enjoy, it's one of those movies that if it's done well then you'll enjoy it, now on the second-time-round the message is certainly correct. The action throughout is cool, the car chases are ruthlessly fun, and finally it's completely on edge from start to finish and with Reeves on top form what's not to like for this second time? Kicking off just a few hours after the ending of John Wick our protagonist (Reeves) is bruised, bloodied and quite frankly fatigued after fighting for hours on end. He's tied in with another plot for revenge with a killer and his duo of assassins (Common, Ruby Rose); he receives info from his trusted hotel manager (McShane) that he is under attack. He must end a wager, to do this he has to fight for his life in a bullet ballet rampage; he must kill someone to somewhat end it, Wick here uses his skills and his wits through this barrage of bullets in the catacombs. Here there is an entertaining montage when he gears up for – perhaps his biggest battle, containing a brilliant cameo from Peter Serafinowicz who helps gear up Wick with an arsenal of weapons, along with his bullet-proof suit. There is also a knife fight on train slightly hinting at The Raid 2. Perhaps this is the message Stahelski is sending to us that he can make a bloody action thriller with a lot of enjoyable moments. Wick then joins forces with the homeless network run by Laurence Fishburne's Bowery King, though instead of showing down to a Matrix-fu brawl, Bowery gives him a favour for saving his life many years before there is even a chance to his maniacal laugh, and for him to prove he's smarter again by riffing famous lines. This is when the film becomes slightly rubbery it loses its footing slightly, as it drags out a bit more. But when the action unfolds again it's immediately back to its home.Stahelski's style isn't limited or indeed of short-supply because there is plenty here to enjoy it's completely ruthless from the opening moments to the stunning Hall of Mirrors set-piece there is a lot of action for any action movie buff to enjoy. Reeves may not be the greatest actor of our generation, nor, indeed is he the worst but he hits every mark with clarity throughout he's brilliant when it comes to the action. Despite the elasticised third act, as the story takes a while to step in. John Wick: Chapter 2 is slightly better than its predecessor it's an adrenaline-fuelled, action-packed ride with a lot of bodies, blood, plenty of material and is downright good fun from start to finish, it's an absolute blast. VERDICT: A bruisingly, brilliant action-packed bullet ballet of a sequel. This is an absolute bloody blast and with Reeves on top form, what's not to love?",8,6,11,17 February 2017
Annihilation," Annihilates your brain
","This review of Annihilation is spoiler free***** (5/5)IF YOU EVER need a well-drawn, super-smart and thought provoking sci-fi (and in this world of identikit sequels, remakes and films we've seen done before we definitely do) a film that will take you on a ride of mystery, the paranormal and take you to a whole new world, then writer-director Alex Garland is your man. Though this isn't the first time he's taken you down this road, his brilliant Oscar-winning debut Ex Machina did pretty much the same thing, which had him take us on a winding road through super-smart thrills involving robots basically it was his vision of A.I. Now, we get his visitation of an alien world. Annihilation is Garland's version of Avatar, and in it he makes true to the different sci-fi tropes while still making it feel solidly original.First off it sets itself as a women-on-a-mission story - a five strong team of scientists each of them with very different skill sets (there's a biologist, a physicist, a geologist, a paramedic and a psychologist) they are sent on a secret, potentially dangerous mission to a crashed meteor site causing different changes in an area of Florida. But that's just the throwaway plotting, as throughout Garland (loosely adapting the best selling novel by Jeff VanderMeer) in it he tackles routes of grief, depression, loneliness and insanity. And with it he's created a story that could change the routes of typical sci-fi. Natalie Portman is Lena - a cellular biologist who suffers from grief after the mysterious disappearance of her husband (Isaac), she also suffers from solidarity and she always feels that her world is not going to be the same again. Normally it would be difficult to find an actress who can portray this kind of personality with such strength, such sadness and such feeling that can make you feel for her, and it looks like Garland has found his true calling in Portman. Of course you have to praise her co-stars too, who each take their roles (with Garland's magnificent guidance) and they each play them beautifully. There's Jennifer Jason Leigh as a sort of general type in charge of their mission, secondly there's Tessa Thompson who's another world beyond the strong warrioress in Thor: Ragnarok etc. And each of them bring the story to the ground. 
 
With that it helps that Garland and his visionary creative team make this world feel as authentic as possible, once through the shimmering purple shield like material it's almost as if Garland has placed our heroines on another planet, a world where evolution has escalated to 11, the animals have changed their features, tree like vines grow on buildings, there are different colours of flowers in the same batch. In short it's a world where nature has no rules, a place where time and space are irrelevant. At the same time Garland gives the audience the big questions; what happens in this place? Is it dangerous? What happens to people in the world? etc. The mysteries are relentlessly unfolded. Here Garland has conjured a world that's beautiful and will have you in constant awe. To be fair, it's best if you just go with it as the film drags you in. Garland was late coming to the director's route; Annihilation is only his second film yet it feels he's been directing for his entire life, but he hasn't been, he started out as a novelist (he wrote the novel to The Beach), later he turned screenwriter going on to write film's such as 28 Days Later and Sunshine to name a couple - this was all years before he took the plunge to write and direct his exceptional debut which was only three years ago. Whatever made him take his time to make these two films it's all been worth it, this is worthy follow-up to Garland's directing career essentially proving that his debut was no joyous accident one that soon saw him become a recognizable figure. And we can't wait to see what he does next.
 
VERDICT Asks questions of mystery but then unravels into something deeper, a film that have you stunned with awe. This is sci-fi at its best.",10,32,66,13 March 2018
Minions," One in a Minion
","This is my review of the lighthearted fun for all the family Minions (spoiler free). This film is set way before the time when the Minions meet Gru (Steve Carrell from Despicable me 1 &2). With a comedic edge the film will probably keep you laughing for ages. There were moments when I was just crying with laughter. The Minions (Piere Coffin, voice) are basically on a quest to find the perfect boss/master the minions in their silly yet hysterical ways try their hardest to keep a master for just longer than a week but it goes horribly wrong for them. The three main Minions (on the poster) are Kevin, Bob and Stuart set off on a journey to find their new master in 1968 (42 years BG, Before Gru) Kevin is the smartest Minion, Stuart is the most ambitious and finally Bob is the cutest and plus the one that is the most clumsy. Minions is a silly yet hilarious prequel to Despicable Me which as you all know is the story of Gru and the Minions. There are three reasons on why I that this film is a must see. 1. Original plot and storyline: This film has an original which basically starts off with the Minions evolution and basically explains more about how the Minions came along in their own funny ways as told by narrator Geoffrey Rush.2. Dialogue: The dialogue is hilarious because it starts off with the Minion language but it isn't off putting it's funny and sometimes witty but there is human dialogue as well. Voices by Sandra Bullock, Steve Coogan, Michael Keaton etc. 3. The Minion: The Minions are the main part of the story (obviously) but the Minions are witty and well probably the most hilarious characters in any animation.Overall this film was really enjoyable and really put a massive smile on my face and it filled the entire cinema with laughter. This is fun for all the family a must see hilarious animation that will put a smile on your face and will keep you laughing from start to finish. This film was especially good in 3D. 9/10 One in a Minion.",9,79,158,26 June 2015
Sin City," The comics got it right
",Frank Miller's Sin City and Director Robert Rodriguez work together to make this violent and brilliant action thriller. It's a monochrome classic with with brilliant violent action scenes but it is a bit weird because some of the characters come back to life but I guess that's how it's done in the comics. Plus with guest director Quentin Tarantino him and Robert get it just right and make it very dark. There are ways you can tell this came from a comic because some of the characters get flown through the air about fifty feet. Elijah Wood who plays Kevin is a sadistic psycho serial killer with long fingernails that can scratch your eyes out and plus he is a cannibal. One small problem with this film there is 12 certificate stripping in an 18 certificate film from Jessica Alba who plays Nancy Callahan. Overall 10/10 and one of the best comic movies I have ever seen.,10,1,3,10 January 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," What a day, What a lovely day!
","Mad Max: Fury may just be my new favourite film mainly because it has epic action battles along with explosions and a fantastic plot that really didn't match the previous films. This film only uses two special effects and they are for the dynamic weather in sand storms. Tom Hardy did a very good performance (again) but that wasn't performance, the best performance came from Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult and the fact that this film has strong women makes me like it even more because I just love when a woman can fight her own battles. If you don't know the plot basically it is an Australian post- apocalyptic film series set in the desert so many years after civilization. The first three films with Mel Gibson were just as good as this was. When I first watched the trailer I saw all the action that it had but I never thought that seeing on the big screen could be so epic, but it would have been better in 3D. Three points on why this film is awesome and spectacular and well a must watch (warning spoilers).1. Epic story and scripting: The script in this film couldn't have been any better and it fit in well with the post-apocalyptic setting. George Miller wrote the script just right for this film I also love the fact that there isn't much dialog in the film but the dialog you do get is just wonderful and story driven in such an amazing way.2. Setting: The setting of the film is in the desert around 45 years after civilization has ended and there are just a few thousand survivors left and they must do their bit to survive and also fight. The people in the film are starving and thirsty and ruled by a kind of dictator who keeps most of the water for himself and his five wives.3. The third and final point is wonderful and brutal action sequences: The action sequences in this are one of a kind with beautiful explosions and actors doing there own stunts and it all just looks very real. The short dialog is definitely worth while because then you see five epic action sequences all ending in a few peoples deaths mainly from explosions, the action sequences can range in time most of them very long but they are glorious to watch in full spectacle.Those are my three points on why this film is absolutely awesome and a must watch. There is a reason why critics loved it all in all this film is excellent and action packed in every way. 10/10 a must watch in all it's action packed blood filled glory.",10,3,10,20 May 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Explosive heroism
","This review of Hacksaw Ridge is spoiler free**** (4/5)As an actor Mel Gibson has gained a fair few roles to get him slightly noticed since his alleged racist tirade seven years ago but they are nothing to praise it was very difficult for him to get his name on another Hollywood production since some studios wouldn't hire him. But since his stunning Best Picture winning debut Braveheart Gibson isn't stupid as he knows exactly what he is doing behind the camera, over the years his films have not just made him a director to watch he's become the director to cherish. Its been 11 years since his last shot behind the camera with 2006s Apocalypto, but it's fair to say that the Australian, earned that time off as his fourth film Hacksaw Ridge seems to be the thing that every Gibson fan was looking for. This fourth shot walks the tightrope without any sort of wobbling the film; it may even lead to Oscars.We first meet the film's centre character Desmond Doss, as a young boy living a happy yet troubled life with his older brother, his mother and his abusive father (Hugo Weaving) who constantly teaches him the differences between rights and wrongs, it's later in this opening that we see what his father is doing to him. Then the film shifts 15 years to a more grown up Desmond, whose troubled young life seems to only be a memory that has left him, it's here that we see he first instance of his heroism when he saves a misfortunate soul. He meets with Dorothy Schutte who happens to be the best catch in town; they form a relationship together using his charm. Though Desmond gets the idea that he wants to join the war which is when the message comes clear that his father doesn't want him to end his life so soon as he tells him about his story of World War I of how he lost all his friends, when he finally says with tearful eyes 'I lost all my friends, I don't want to lose my sons as well' but Desmond is determined that he will come back home unscathed. He decides to go through as a combat medic; he refuses to hold a rifle as he is against violence but when it comes to heroism he shines. The second act when he starts his training it doesn't take itself too seriously as there is moment that is very funny as the drill Sergeant (Vince Vaughn) gives all his men new hilarious nicknames and gives us a few zingers, but it's not horrendously misplaced. Desmond spends most of his time as the army's punching bag he is constantly beaten up arrested for his beliefs yet his determination doesn't whither which is when we see his full strength. The opening of the second half is when Gibson's vision truly comes to life as we veer into the battlements of Okinawa, Japan (filmed in Australia) like his three previous films there was always a moment when the violence would keep its this film does essentially the same thing. Doss and his teammates are engulfed by a cascade of bullets, a huge body count, explosions and puddles of blood. He still shows determination as he has to save some of his comrades, it takes time to show this happening but it's still impacting nonetheless. Unfortunately the film does flag a little perhaps due to the times of territorial overkill when the fight becomes long, and at points never seems to halt. But it's all essential stuff as this is a time when Hacksaw Ridge becomes a Gibson film when he gathers all his expertise into one scene. His transitions through the two different flanks are all wonderfully adept. When the battle finally halts there is a gorgeous shot of a slender Desmond running through the battlements to save some of his teammates, it turns into a stealth mission, but it's beautifully done. In addition, his superiors call him a hero. Granted the film flags and it seems this film Gibson not just the director to watch it makes him the director to cherish. Hacksaw Ridge is essentially this century's Saving Private Ryan. VERDICT: Garfield and Palmer are phenomenal, in this sensational biopic that shows heroism and justice that's heavily impacting, truly moving with Oscar worthy performances and a lot of heart.",8,2,5,26 January 2017
Warcraft," Crafting the tools of War
","My review of Warcraft: The Beginning (spoiler free) *** (3 out of 5)Cast: Travis Fimmel, Paula Patton, Ben Foster with Dominic Cooper and Toby Kebbell.Plot: The peaceful realm of Azeroth stands on the brink of war as its civilization faces a fearsome race of invaders: orc warriors fleeing their dying home to colonize another.2016 so far seems to have a few game adaptations like Angry Birds and now this both of which were better than they made out to be. Were as Angry Birds started off as a mobile game this one is completely different because it is based on well you know what World of Warcraft is.Director Duncan Jones surely challenged himself because this type of film isn't easy to make other than the fact it was done by CG. With a mostly unknown cast the film triumphs and is probably the best game adaptation ever.There are a quite a few game adaptations out there and most of them were disappointing like Resident Evil, Doom and Super bloody Mario Brothers, this one achieves the one thing that they are not that this is visually stunning and well good. It had the perfect director to make it because he knew what kind of challenge it would be and also he's a World of Warcraft nerd.This may not be the greatest movie of all time but certainly has it's perks here are some points as to why this prevails on it's genre: CGI: This movie is CGI based from start to finish but it has to be some of the best CG ever, and it makes for one hell epic ride through the world of Azeroth. The CGI makes it look so real it almost seems like a real place and you can just bet if you go then you'll most likely see orcs. Even the CG battle scenes are just beautiful to look at with something different happening every time.Origin: We all know how this started it started as a PC game and became ever so popular but because this is mainly CG based it couldn't have been done, personally I've never played the game but this is a truly epic ride into that world. Even though this is a fantasy game it has been done well and it is very fun to watch.The OK point: Action: The action has been very well to which there is something different happening every time, but the battle scenes get dull fairly that's not to say they are boring it's just the action is a key component and it just seems like it could've been better. Other than the that the film is very pretty and well action packed.The bad point: Plot: The movie doesn't follow the game to the point, because the plot is just non-existent it just makes it look like the director focused on making the movie look pretty and full of action, without actually having a plot. To make this movie it should have succeeded in all three points just mentioned instead of just two.Other than that the movie was enjoyable and completely bursting with action and it was just absolutely gorgeous to watch, ignoring the fact the plot wasn't there.Verdict: Entertaining, captivating and just beautiful this is another game based film that isn't disappointing, and definitely worth a watch.6/10 Good.",6,2,8,5 June 2016
Sully," Miraculous Heroes
","This review of Sully: Miracle on the Hudson is spoiler free**** (4/5)ON 9TH November the headlines and Social Media sites were riddled with images and headlines of Donald Trump winning the Presidential Election, and in our media saturated world where we are bombarded by images of heroes and villains overtaking the news. That seems like one of the more normal stories. However, if you go back seven years to January 2009 we were introduced to an unlikely hero when the headlines read 'Miracle on the Hudson' the image was of a passenger jet (Airbus A320) floating on the Hudson River, the plane had all 155 passengers stood on the wings. On the cold afternoon of January 15th 2009 Captain Chesley Burnett Sullenberger III nicknamed 'Sully' was doing his normal duty of flying a full capacity passenger jet from LaGuardia Airport in New York until his flight path was interrupted by a flock of Canadian geese, a couple of those geese landed in the engine. In the cockpit Chesley and his co pilot/best friend Jeff Skiles were thinking of a rather bizarre scenario of how they could land the jet, they spent 209 seconds thinking about how they could pull it off, without harming any passenger. Everyone on board was panicking while the disabled jet went gliding towards New York's Hudson River until it landed all 155 passengers and crew were saved; Sully was hailed as a national hero. Based on Sully's best selling memoirs Highest Duty: My Search for What Really Matters, Clint Eastwood's Sully explores the untold story of this unlikely hero and how he went from being heralded by everyone he walked past to being constantly investigated, in many seemingly never ending court hearings where he is sat with his best friend/co pilot who is in the form of a witness as he is worried about losing his pilot license. It seems hard to find an actor who can sell this look very convincingly but Eastwood seemed to have his mind set on Tom Hanks who is transformed into the exact doppelganger of Sully, and Hanks' performance as our hero is electrifying. The movie opens around a year after the miraculous incident with Sully envisioning his own demise by having a dream of the event happening differently, with the plane he was piloting ending up in a building killing and injuring everyone in the immediate vicinity of the explosion, stepping into the territorial recreation of 9/11. When he wakes the people around him are constantly worried even his wife Lorrie Sullenberger (Laura Linney), thinks that her husband isn't the same anymore. His best friend Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) seems to be the only one who can bring him back as he is always there with him as someone to rely on for help. Director Eastwood made this story in his own typical style with the story telling itself as the film unfolds, there are many slow moments were nothing much happens Hanks' charisma manages to pull us through the film's slower moments were the narrative is sadly left empty. Though when we get to the showing of the event we it becomes a lot faster showing the panicking passengers and the cockpit with Skiles and Sully taking charge of the jet which is hurtling out of control. It's a clever use of editing that's on show as the story manages to hold all these things together with some gripping but sadly limited drama. The event itself is beautifully done filled with tense moments and thrilling camera pans showing the inside and around the outside of the jet; though granted the familiarity with other air disaster movies takes a giant chunk out of the story but Hanks and Eckhart manage to keep the film going and try to strive away from the overall familiarity. There are two moments when the narrative of the story's history takes a hold of Sully's life told in little snippet type flashbacks both of them are set around the time when he is in training, the first when he is just a child aged around 13 when he lands a bi plane successfully, the second shows him flying a damaged fighter jet in the air force, it's another moment that's added to the overall premise making it slightly more human. The scenes after the incident mainly contain of never ending court hearings donned by Mike O'Malley's Charles Porter, who is always in constant disbelief at when Sully says that he had no choice as he could feel the plane go, he's more annoying to put up with. Eastwood's retelling of the air disaster itself is the strongest part of this story helped by his camera transitions panning the outside, the panicking passengers screaming, inside the cockpit and back again which are all wonderfully adept and gives the film a bit of a Hollywood feel but its impressive nonetheless. The sheer sense of speed of the gliding jet attempting a landing on the frigid waters, the attention to detail the pacing of each disaster scene and sense of overall verisimilitude its all Paul Greengrass level stuff and shouldn't be a problem for Eastwood. Though the premise oddly feels familiar with other real life air disasters, the sense of heroism in this story takes a gripping hold and just the recreation of history repeating itself is nicely done with brutal beauty,. Altogether Sully is a beautiful depiction of history repeating itself, buoyed by powerful performances that are nothing less than Oscar-worthy. VERDICT Hanks takes flight in yet another powerful Oscar-worthy title role performance, which is gripping, thrilling and certainly one of the best air disaster movies ever.8/10 thrilling.",8,0,1,2 December 2016
Alien: Covenant," Heavy-handed arc
","This review of Alien Covenant is spoiler free*** (3/5)WITHIN THE FIRST few minutes of Alien Covenant's opening title in director Ridley Scott's iconic form, there's a sense of familiarity perhaps it's to do with the title forming itself on the screen in front of us or the haunting background soundtrack originally composed by Jerry Goldsmith, re-done for this new installment by Jed Kurzel perhaps as an inspiration. But within an instant of the first few we are back on familiar ground or in this space. Another familiar point is that we welcome back the iconic Xenomorph (looking as gloriously terrifying as ever), sure Prometheus may have left you frustrated due to the lack of the curly-headed, sword-tailed villain from the original Alien then this – may perhaps leave you happier that he is back in glorious form and running havoc again. The new ideas are to come first before even the slightest showing of the titular villain; of course there are new characters to follow new stories, a new ship, and a new planet.Set ten years after the ill-fated mission of the Prometheus, the USCSS Covenant is on a mission to colonize an Earth-like planet in a solar system thousands of light years from their home. The ship has particularly similar shape too, if you look closely you can see the design is much in the of the Nostromo, except it's perhaps thinner, on board the are 2,000 willing colonists in hyper-sleep and 1400 human embryos tightly wrapped in compacted draws. This thanks to Scott's much improved directing style after The Martian looks particularly stunning, using his technical devices such as the lighting effects and tightly cornered, slightly claustrophobic corridors, and of course the voicing of the iconic computer MOTHER, Scott uses these well to make this the closest to his original. This bodes well for some time, were as the original is a sci-fi masterpiece – this, is not there are flaws.Firstly, the crew of the Covenant are particularly nondescript, there are fifteen including Michael Fassbender's soft-talking android Walter, (compared to Alien's eight members including Ripley's cat) all lead to this planet by newly promoted captain (Crudup). Who have been in hyper-sleep for many years, and have just received a rogue message from an anonymous planet during their colonization mission to Origae-6. Of course, each member is against this message; Katherine Waterston's Daniels is particularly concerned about the lack of bird sounds from the planet's surface. It's not the presentation of the characters that's flawed it's their story, most of them are married couples, and when the inevitable comes there's not enough emotional heft that drives them. Promisingly there are some hilarious moments – notably the crew banter 'Sugar tits,' Danny McBride's Tennessee mutters, but the rest of their narration is sadly flawed. Thankfully their stoic performances, the standout is McBride carry the film enough to pull through.Secondly, the tone; the problem with Scott's directing is, he either makes his films too light or too heavy, here the emphasis is high on heavy. It's a slow drive from the opening, the tension is there from the very beginning we know what kind of film this is, and it's inevitable that these characters meet their demise at some point. Here, it's obvious, were as the original had tension in the right places it was hard to know which one would go first, then there's that pinnacle moment that everyone knows. Like the Xenomorph, this blind to it's own flaws, it's as if Scott has a say on how and when each character goes; example when a lesser used person takes a break from work – it's obvious to what happens next. In the original that happened – perhaps one or two times, but here it's seemingly endless. He's not light on this material either, there's a lot of gore - in fact a seemingly cringeworthy amount of it, there's not too much – there is of course a more notable way of direction, which takes a turn into the more familiar territory too.Both of these flaws are thankfully brushed over by the tension, which is clearly noticeable from the first planetary footsteps – the tension is on the constant rise from the moment we see these alien critters to the third act – though fast in it's execution is stunning and proudly gives a solid end to the sixth film in the franchise. Alien Covenant isn't the best Alien film in the franchise but thanks to Scott's stunning direction and the beautiful practical effects Scott is back on firm ground.VERDICT: Not the best but certainly not the worst, with it's flawed narration and heavy-handed techniques it's vast improvement on his last sci-fi venture. That still sadly doesn't top the 1979 original.",6,3,12,12 May 2017
