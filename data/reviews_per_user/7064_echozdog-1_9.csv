Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Painfully bad.
",This was so bad that had I paid to see it I would have asked for my money back. I went to the drive-in with my kids to watch X-men. This was the second flick. Only 9 year old boy stayed awake and wanted to watch this piece of crap so I sat watched. I knew this was bad about 3 minutes into it. Johhny Depp is walking thru this movie. It seems like he did this just so his kids can watch him in a movie as Captain Jack. That or he couldn't say no to all those millions. Whatever his motivations making a good movie was not on the table.It one chase/sword fight scene followed by another interrupted by bad jokes and pointless dialog. Boring Boring Boring. Any to top it off it clocked in at 2.5 hours of crap. I didn't get out of the theater until 2:30 AM. Even my 9 yr old fell asleep about 15 min before the end and I woke him up and said 'Oh no buddy. You wanted to watch this garbage your going to stay and wake and watch it!'.Max gave it 2 and he loves this kind of crap.,1,13,26,5 June 2011
Marie Antoinette," My God! Add some Drama! UGH! (No Spoilers)
","There are no spoilers in this review. Spoilers would mean that there was something to spoil. The trailer shows Marie living the life of royalty. Lather, rinse, repeat. Everyday is the same. They eat. They play. They Gossip. They suck! OK. I get it after 15-20 minutes of that. But like a little pink bunny, it keeps going on and on and on. I kept expecting Marie to shake things up. At one point she kind of does by clapping at an opera when you are not supposed to. Everyone does to. OK Change. I kept waiting and waiting. Yet nothing more happens. I'm sure it was realistic, but come on. You don't make movies about boring people! Don't make a movie about me unless you plan to dramatize the hell out of it. Then when you've sat and watched and watched and watched these rich snooty people go on and on you think 'OK the payoff is the revolution. We get to see these heads roll'. Sorry Charilie. That might have saved the movie. Instead we get to only see the boring parts of her life. Then it ends. UGH!",3,8,14,25 July 2008
In Bruges," Why haven't I heard of this movie??? WOW!
",So I'm flicking through the pay channels last night and came across this movie just after the credits rolled. I see Collin Farrel and go hey 'I like that actor I think I'll watch'. I was immediately grabbed by the surreal dialog that goes on. This screen play was a work of genius. I don't know who Martin McDonagh is but I will be looking for what else he does and see it. I'm not sure how to say it but it has the right mix of drama and comedy that had me staying up until 1AM on the week day (and I have 4 kids). The cast was awesome. Colin Farrel plays the tortured soul of a hit man trying to come to terms with a hit gone bad and hating being in Bruges. Brendan Gleeson plays the other hit man who loves Bruges and wants to tour the town. The banter and dialog between the two of them and the town folks had me riveted and laughing for 2 hours. Then half way through Ralph Fiennes pops up in the movie. Ralph Fiennes! The twists and turns this movie makes blew me away. 9/10 (I only did the 9 because I guessed part of the ending 15 minutes before it happened),9,1,3,4 August 2009
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," A lot of people missed out on a great flick.
","The trailer for this movie had me thinking 'Lot's of CGI & no story' but the reverse is true. The CGI is there but not intrusive and I really liked the story. I know I like a movie when I care about the characters. I liked the brothers, I liked the female lead, I liked the dad. Jake G (too lazy to spell it) was way better as an action hero than I would have expected. He plays the orphan prince who has no throne aspirations down to a tee. The movie begins and end with his performance and he pulled it off swimmingly. The chemistry between Jake and female lead was well played and believable. The love between the brothers was critical to the story and I liked it. I took my two boys (11 and 8) and they loved it. I had to explain some the time travel stuff, but otherwise they followed along just fine.I didn't go see this when it first came out because the trailer made it look like a poor mans cross between 'The Mummy' and 'Indiana Jones'. This was better than the 'The Mummy' (which I liked). It's no 'Raiders of the lost ark', but it was worth the $2.50 I paid at the door.I hope it made money and there is a sequel with the main actors all reprising. I'd take my boys when it's $7.50 (although I'm sure I'd be disappointed...rarely do sequels measure up).9/10",9,1,3,6 July 2010
Superbad," I AM McLovin this movie
",The mix of surreal and real is the key to what makes this movie great. You take your average teen flick about the geeks of a high school during last days of their senior year trying to get laid before they head off to college. Yes a tried and true formula. It probably gets a few laughs. But this movie adds the weird and surreal twists into plot that makes the jokes a 100 times funnier. I couldn't guess where the movie was going and I didn't see the jokes coming. I laughed out load (LOL for real) about 30 times. The real strength of the movie is the three main characters. They all have the best dialog and the actors deliver it better than I bet the writers could have hoped for. This movie is now in my top five of comedies. 10/10. I'm McLovin it.,10,1,4,8 October 2008
Quantum of Solace," Quantum of Physics
","OK I went into this one with low expectations. I've heard all the 'not a bond movie' reviews and was expecting a bad Borne movie. Well there is some truth to that. The action scenes are straight from the Borne movies in that they are annoyingly hard to follow (and don't follow much in the way of being believable). I'm a firm believer that this style of action scenes does not come from the desire of the director to make a more engaging scene, but that they are easier to film in tiny 1/4 second slices and then edit the hell out of it. Shake the camera a lot so to cover up the mistakes. When they did this in the Borne movies and the public loved it we all have to suffer from the imitations.As for the rest of the movie...it was great. I liked the introduction to the new SPECTRE (Quantum) and liked that aspect of the old Bond films. The villain was kind of crazy enough. I did like that his second (the guy with the little unusualness that all spy movies have) didn't wind up in usual fist fight with bond (this is not a spoiler).I didn't like the bad guys and I liked the good guys. Action scenes could have been done better (probably budget cuts). Acting was standard.8/10 Good cheap fun.",8,7,14,25 January 2009
I Am Legend," I am bored
","I am Legend is entertaining but flawed. We all know the premise. He's the last immune person in New York to a deadly virus that kills 90% of the people and turns the 9% into hairless raving maniacs. Leaving the last 1% to be eaten by the 9%. He's military scientist that is working on cure for the virus that will return the people back to normal. Int he mean time he hunts deer with his German Shepard. The best parts are the tense moments where he has to stay in the light away from the crazies. The boring parts are when we get to see how he goes about his day. It just wasn't that interesting. The movie picks up after some bad things happen and then some good things. Just when it looks like it really might be getting good, we have an ending which I didn't care for. I felt it missed the mark. The crazies would have been better played by people rather than CGI characters. Oh well, it was OK for a DVD rental. 7/10",7,1,2,16 October 2008
The Dark Knight," Great movie! Best of all time? Uh No.
","Don't get me wrong. I really liked this movie. It was intense, exciting, funny and down and dirty. It has it all. Great acting from Heath Ledger (of course he gets the best part to play, with the best lines). The rest of the characters are drone though (with the exception that Maggie Gyllenhaal. She gives some real depth to Rachel (one that Katie Holmes could only dream of doing). It fast paced, it has some really great scenes, great action and I was on the edge of my seat most of the way through. It reminded me a bit of the type of movie that 'The Fugitive' was. The only flaws are how all the story lines are tied together, the obvious CGI on Two-face (this was very distracting), ending was a bit anti-climatic and it was a little predictable. I saw it at a half full matin√©e for $5 and felt I got my money's worth. 9/10 To have this rank at the best movie of all time on IMDb? HA! No I think not. The Godfather is better, but The Godfather isn't the best either. I can name 20 movies better than the both of these. But a ranking is subjective. This one will come down.",9,1,7,25 July 2008
X-Men: First Class," Very Well done
","This is fresh, the X-men are forming. It's the back story that's more exciting and fun than the later stuff. The actors are all stars in the making making them believable as their characters. I mean the last movies you really expected Professor X to say 'make it so' at any moment. The back story of the Cuban missile crisis is fantastic nuclear war threat that the villain organizes reminds me of the villain plots of the 60s Bond movies. The 60s music and sexy outfits if a fun setting for the backdrop of the movie. Great movie.Verdict: This makes the last X-men movies look like sequels that went on too long.",9,2,5,5 June 2011
