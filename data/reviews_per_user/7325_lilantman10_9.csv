The Avengers," Wow
","Finally the Marvel Franchise reveals it's coup de grace and it's everything that we hoped for. Before I totally kiss this movie's butt for a while I'm going to delve into the negatives first.Just a warning the first 25 minutes are a little slow, which is to be expected when telling such a large story. Lord of the Rings needed a whole movie to build up to the adventure to put it into context. Some of Loki's dialogue is a little hard to understand at times because of the Norse language dialect, but that's easily fixed with second viewings. Other than that and some nitpicks the movie delivers.This is the movie we all made playing with our toys as a kid. Wheedon has done a fantastic job and I really don't think this movie could've worked as well without him. All the characters fit in this movie. I never thought a conversation between Loki and Nick Fury would work on screen but it does. Every character gets to shine in this movie. At time it's a Black Widow movie, then an Ironman movie, then a Thor movie, then a Captain America movie it all just fits perfectly. This movie has the best editing I've seen all year and some of the best acting to go with it. This movie is a culmination of several geek movies in one. It's got the ear turning and self reflection of Scott Pilgrim with the ensemble aspect of Star Trek (2009) with great dialogue. I'm going to say character a lot because that's the focus. The story is a little weak because it comes second to the characters. I've always described superhero movies are character pieces with big budgets. A lot of people complained that it's a comedy or that it's just a loud mindless movie with explosions like Transformers. Since when does having great humor make something a comedy? All the humor is in the witty dialogue and a few physical gags which are hilarious and also unique to the characters. And Wheedon adds lots of little subtle setups to the ending to make the movie more cohesive and smarter than it is. It's not a bad story it's just a simple character driven one. The only superhero movie I know that has more emphasis on story is The Dark Knight, but this blows that out of the water. 6 heroes are better than one. That's why Lord of The Rings, Star Trek, and Toy Story are so great. The Team or The Ensemble. There are so many ways this movie could've been ruined. Maybe they got the writing right, and the action is choreographed well but is filmed with shaky cam or is incoherent. All the action scenes in this movie are great and easy on the eyes and even have lots of character in them. The best scene in this movie is when the avengers are all arguing in a room. And the acting is the greatest. I still have a hard time wrestling with who was my favorite actor in this. This movie is so much fun and if you don't like it it's probably because you didn't want to so anybody with an open mind should love this 10 out of 10",10,12,24,10 December 2012
Skyfall," Good movie, classic Bond maybe
","I've never been a big fan of certain franchises that people love. Lord Of The Rings, Star Wars, and James Bond come to mind. While I respect and give praise to all 3 I just don't quite understand the love. Probably because I've never seen most of them and when i do the hype makes my expectations too high. Ironically I've seen every single Daniel Craig Bond movie and my enjoyment is also mixed. While Casino Royale is a fantastic movie, it left me cold. It's me not you principal. This is along the lines of Casino Royale and while it's always tempting to compare the two, i'd say they're at the same level. Skyfall is bigger and more personal, Casino Royale is tighter and more specific. That being said Skyfall also left me cold. I can't help but think that if i had went in with no expectations i would've loved it more. But once again that's my fault not the movies.The good. WOW. this is what I want to see in a james bond movie. Developed Characters, amazing action, great acting, solid script, two interesting bond girls, etc. Every praise this movie gets is earned in spades. The stuff I loved was the aesthetic. This is the most beautiful movie I've ever seen. Jaw Dropping this is definitely something on blu ray. Also this is a very smart movie. For people who just want action it's there and for people who want drama there you have it. Also Daniel Craig, who always delivers as bond, knocks it out of the park. 2012 was definitely the year for action movies this Django, Avengers, and TDKR all having incredible set pieces.The negative, and once again this will not have an effect on my overall opinion this is just me, Too long. I had the same problem with Casino so i don't know if it's me, but honestly I didn't notice the running time until this movie. The pacing is good in the first half but as the movie goes on there is a little drag going on. I didn't mention Javier Bardem in my positives. This year is also the year for underusing or undermining Best Supporting Actor performances in the third act of the movie. This , Prometheus, Django, Seven Psychopaths, The Dark Knight Rises, all great performances that totally don't get utilized. He's a revelation. He's incredible it's ridicicolous how amazing his intro into this movie is. But as it goes on he becomes less interesting. They even have his face covered up so he doesn't get to emote that well. Still an amazing performance I hope they keep going with this direction of villains. Great movie, not in the slightest overrated and will definitely get better with repeat viewings. The flaws are there if you look for them , but other then those people, and idiots like myself, everybody else will fall in love with this movieAfter re-watching the movie , most of the flaws I saw where fixed and it completely lives up to the hype, except for the ending which is still a tad anti-climatic , and some plot strands unanswered, but still great movie I do have to say this is the best Daniel Craig bond movie.",8,5,12,31 January 2013
Iron Man 3," Great Movie can't be made if you disagree
","Big fan of the Marvel Film Franchise, they're doing excellent work and it seems like Phase 2 is all about ' Let's try something new' and fresh out of the gate we have Ironman 3. The good thing I think everybody can agree on is this is a movie that can be taken seriously and is much more mature then the other Ironman films, in a good way. I've seen several spoiler filled reviews so people can talk about what they liked didn't like.Here's how I'll put it. If you don't think you'll like it you won't simple as that. This will not be the movie that will change your mind, catch it on Redbox. This is the big deciding factor on if you will like this movie or not. Are you willing to unbiasedly watch a movie, putting away all previous expectations from trailers, earlier movies, and comic book lore, and enjoy it on it's own merit. If yes then this is a great Ironman movie. It's almost more of a Bourne / Tom Clancy movie then an Ironman movie. Which is great everybody complained about there not being enough tension or Avengers being a kids movie. Here you go, most tension I've felt in a superhero movie while still having fun and laughing.But as I said, admittedly the marketing for this movie completely mis sold it and I cannot begrudge anybody for being disappointed. But honestly if you can get past the total change in direction for the series then you will probably enjoy it a whole lot.",10,1,8,3 May 2013
This Is the End," The Avengers of Comedies
","This works both extremely well as a comedy and a horror movie delivering characters I care about, and also some good performances. The stand out performances for me are McBride, Baruchel, and Robinson. Robinson and Baruchel both give really good dramatic performances and also give of a few funny lines.McBride stands out as not only the best actor out of the group, anybody who watches Eastbound and Down can attest to this, but also is the best at delivering his lines dramatic or comedic and really steals the show.Rogen's playing himself as always and he's solid. Hill has a funny arc , but is really a side character, and you could completely take Franco out of this movie and replace him with Segel or Paul Rudd who I think would've brought more to the role once again Franco sleepwalks through another movie.No real significant flaws to mention , didn't want it to end definitely a must see for everyone who loves these guys, but if you don't like their humor then definitely don't see it you already know you won't like it.Just For Fun To Nail In the avengers comparisonTony Stark = Seth Rogen Bruce Banner = Danny McBride Thor = Jonah Hill Steve Rogers = Craig Ferguson Natasha Romanoff = Jay Baruchel Hawkeye = James Franco",10,7,31,11 June 2013
Man of Steel," If You're Cautious About This Movie Stay Away
","I'm just going to cut to the chase. Everybody saying this is the movie of the year and that the critics are wrong were loving the movie before it even came out. I don't know how many times I've seen ' Man Of Steel Best Movie Of The Year' weeks before it came out. So this is for the people who want to watch it objectively.It's an okay movie. Okay in every since of the word. The Writing is okay. The direction is okay. The action is okay. The Editing is horrible, or should I say the story structure since Goyer didn't look at the complaints of TDKR and constructive improve his script. The acting is superb , but nothing to really run home to, Snyder just picked excellent actors to fill in mostly generic uninteresting role.I'm going to compare this to two movies. Transformers and Avengers. Now In Avengers there's no real sense of tension or danger and in Transformers there's a lot of havoc and chaos. The problem with Man Of Steel is that there's so much carnage that it feels like this is the climax to end all climaxes. In transformers and Avengers it was a city or two that leveled. If this movie followed through with the destruction it caused then there'd be no Metropolis. Superman doesn't save one person. What's more is that Avengers and Transformers are smart enough not try to use civilian life as an emotional trigger. They pretend like nobody died and keep it moving. This literally has buildings falling on people and Superman not only doesn't bat an eye, but there's no aftermath of this destruction. Just feels lazy and takes any emotional punch out of the movie.",1,1,3,17 June 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," The Only Best Picture Nomination that actually earns it.
","Nothing makes me happier then to see an actor people just think are comedians or just okay and then they turn out to be great actors. 2012 is the year for proving you're acting chops, with Jack Black in Bernie, Matthew MacCoughney in Killer Joe, And supporting role in Magic Mike and Sean William Scott in Goon. Although these performances where largely ignored and do deserve Oscars, Bradley Cooper also knocked it out of the park as a bipolar man who wants to put his life back together after a major breakdown. I always told people he'd get an Oscar one day after I saw Limitless.I'm not going to go into the story, because really that's a second hand and it's really a character piece and also a study on mental illness. That being said every single performance in here is great. Even Chris Tucker, someone who I thought had absolutely no range, really knocks it out of the park. Bradley Cooper really transforms himself into a beaten down, but really genuine person. Jennifer Lawrence was amazing as well turning in a more emotional and raw performance but still just as good. This is an actor's movie and everybody showed up to do work. I have ultimately nothing really negative to say about this movie. Normally these 'Oscar' movies have really bad pacing, too long, and you can feel the ego coming from behind the camera. Nope David O Russell Clearly just wants to tell a good story. Normally I like darker movies, like Black Swan, so anybody thinking this is a sappy, sweet movie you're absolutely wrong. This is an incredibly sincere movie. I teared up I laughed and I liked all the characters. Definitely a surprise for me and hopefully, but let's be realistic, at the very least this will walk away with at least two Oscars, not that it matters because this is still a great movie.",9,0,3,1 February 2013
Django Unchained," Uhhhhhhhhhh
","This is a sloppy movie. Maybe the sloppiest I've seen all year. It beat out TDKR and Alien: The Beginning. Let me start by saying I think Tarantino is a very talented director. It doesn't always show in his movies, but he's very good. I'm tired of his movies that are always too long, and uneven. While this movie is long I didn't feel it and I didn't get that sense of him just having characters talk just to talk so he can hear the dialogue he wrote for himself. Basically QT is a kid who uses actors to reenact his favorite scenes from other movies he loves. I do believe he redeemed himself a little , because I was getting sick of him and his indulgences. I think he gets too much credit for doing stuff other actors get hanged, poor choice of words, for. I think Edgar Wright is a much better director and will soon pass him and hopefully get more credit. Now that said I'm going to try my hardest to make more sense then this movies tone.First off let me start off with the bad. This movie is all over the place. I though Inglorious Basterds was crazy , but this takes the cake. I actually have to give that movie more credit, because it felt like it was working towards something and everything fit in a crazy sort of way. You're going to here this a lot. This movie has 3 different parts and everyone who reviews will say what I'm saying verbatim. The First hour is a buddy cop western, The second hour is a tension filled game of deception, the last hour is the action. The problem is that the transition is not smooth at all, there's no balance or real order and you will know what I'm talking about if you go see it. Think back to Kill Bill and how different the two volumes where. Now Imagine if it was in one movie. The pacing is slow, but for Tarantino it's a step in the right direction. Really the movie can't make up it's mind and it damages the film a significant degree. From the trailer I thought Jamie would be one note, but he turns in a solid performance. Kerry Washington has the worst performance I've seen in a Tarantino film. She is so underused and has absolutely no character. No wait. There was a worse performance. Tarantino has a cameo and it has to be the worst performance of a director in his own movie I've ever seen. He should be ashamed of himself.Next I'm going to touch on the issue of race and the use of the n-word. I'm black and I'm pretty lenient on the n word. I say it my friends say it, some of my white friends say it. I don't care it's just a word. If this was any other director I wouldn't have minded, but it's by a guy who constantly pushes the boundaries of good taste and not in a good way. I understand that it is in a time where the word was probably used a lot, but the way the movies uses it is a little gratuitous at times. I feel like Tarantino tried to fit it in when he could as opposed to using it occasional to shock people. Next is Samuel Jackson's character is extremely coonish . Once again it's hard to fully criticize, because he's playing a cliché house negro, but even then he's such a cartoon it's hard to accept. Basically like most Tarantino's recent films, it's all about if you love Tarantino or are tired of him. Me being Tired surprisingly was mildly annoyed, but as his performance went on he was given some depth. I'd be okay with all this if this was a serious movie about slavery with Western elements. But really it's a goofy western with moments of seriousness that doesn't fit. Tarantino wants to deal with slavery, but it's so cartoonish when he does the only message you can take away was 'Slavery was bad' Good Job Quentin definitely a revelation.Now the good. Wow the action in this movie blew me away. It's incredible and it makes me wish there was more of it. The Gore was refreshing from movies where it looked to bright or was CGI. This was all practical and it gave the action scenes a real sense of beauty and coordination. There's no doubt someone got shot because they'll be a huge splash of blood that highlights the trail of the bullets. Next performances all pretty much top notch . Leo is amazing , Sammy is good, Waltz is good. I love westerns and this one is a good one.Unfortunately I have to give this movie a 7 or a Matinée. It felt like Tarantino was sleep walking through this one. Too much light comedy where it doesn't belong and too much deep ugliness that doesn't fit. I did feel more positive then negative even though the movie needed more scenes of tension and action. I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt and I even debated sneaking back in the theatre to watch it again. Any 2 plus hour movie that makes me want to not only sit without breaks, and rewatch right after is either called Fight Club or GoodFellas. Definitely a must see, but not one that you need to rush out and see.",7,10,24,25 December 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," What Happened?
","I consider myself a huge fan of comic book movies. They're basically character studies with huge budgets and great special effects. I have to admit I'm not the hugest fan of Nolan's trilogy. For a movie that's supposed to be so serious and realistic the movies stop to have really dumb unrealistic moments for the sake of being 'epic'. Not to mention whenever Nolan writes dialogue for the mystique or mythos of Batman it's ALWAYS corny. He writes such great dialogue for his villains but anytime he tries to write for Batman or people talking about the idea of Batman it gets super cheesy *SPOILERS*****. The result we have here is basically Nolan sleepwalking through the movie with poor dialogue, plot inconsistencies, character motivations that aren't clear, poor fight choreography, and probably the worst ending I've ever seen in a superhero movie or a Nolan film in general.To get the good out of the way.... Ummm I honestly have nothing good to say about this movie. All the pieces are here to make a great movie. I can see why people love this movie, because it's basically a copy of The Dark Knight. Everything good gets undercut by the end of the movie. Tom Hardy as Bane turns in a great menacing performance that is worthy being held up to next to the Joker. He almost saves the film just like Heath Ledger did with the first sequel except towards the end of the movie he is totally underused and undercut. But all of his scenes where good or at least set up well. There's also two cameos that where great and really pumped me up for the rest of the movie that I won't spoil. I could say the movies greatest strength and crutch is that it ties so well into the first movie, but that also slows the movie down and makes it trip over it's own feet several times. The Score is solid if a little repetitive and the movie looks great at points.Now to the bad. This movie is so slow. I'm not going to say boring because that's subjective, but even people who loved the movie can attest to the fact that this movie's pacing is a big problem. What's more is the story pacing which takes it's time inching along until the final act which just breezes by important details leaving anyone besides the core fan base cold and unsatisfied. The editing is horrific and I don't know if I can blame the editor or Nolan's top heavy script which just like the last movie brings in the overly complicated story. The problem with such a convoluted narrative is that in order to get people to know what's going on the audience gets their hand held through scenes as actors have to constantly repeat what we're supposed to take away from the scene, which makes the movie predictable. I knew the ending to every single scene either from knowing the way it mirrored a scene earlier in the trilogy or just the way it's telegraphed. The acting isn't very good either aside from Bane who ironically gets more expressiveness out of his face when it's mostly covered up. All these actors are normally great but they're literally given only one expression. All the characters are one note throughout the whole movie there is no real character progression. The ending is stupid in so many ways i won't get into and this is just an unpleasant experience for anyone who isn't already loving the movie walking in.Now to hit some personal points I think Nolan is a good director who gets a lot of credit for using a very specific bag of tricks and makes crowd pleaser's that function as thought provoking movies. Much like Tarantino once you see the formula a lot of the magic is gone. Nolan is no David Fincher or Sam Mendes. He doesn't have the teeth to end a movie in a dark way everything always works out in the end and it's frustrating. *****SPOILERS***** The last act is probably more boring because there's no sense of tension. I knew from the beginning no main characters where going to die because Nolan is so soft. If I had to give the last harry potter movies credit they killed off a lot of the main cast so there was a genuine sense of not knowing whose going to make it. Another problem is that this is the most indulgent movie I've seen this year. There is no reason this movie needed to be so long. It pretends to be some great thoughtful movie, but it's not. There are so many themes in this movie that are too obvious or don't come into play into the movies ending. Not to mention the themes in this movie heavily contradict the ones in the previous movies. This is a really dumb movie pretending to be a smart thoughtful one. There are so many moments that are exaggerated to a ridiculous level to be 'epic' that made me roll my eyes, this is on a Spiderman 3 level of trilogy ending.I'm giving this 4 stars because the average movie audience isn't going to care about story structure and not look as deep into it as some cinephiles may. It's a very polarizing movie, but it's really insulting at times and the more I think about it the more I dislike it. I'm really worried that superman might be 3 hours long now.",4,4,8,10 December 2012
The Hangover Part III," How the Mighty Have Fallen
","I liked Hangover. It was a cool movie with a really fun story and a great cast with a damn good script behind them. One of my least favorite aspects was Alan and Chow, the two characters with the least amount of actual good writing. Now the actors worked with what they had, but overall outside of anybody in high school they weren't that funny.I read somewhere that Jack Sparrow , essentially a side character in the original pirates movie, was modeled sort of like Han Solo. Start of as a side character and then given a prominent role. Now anybody who watched Return of the Jedi will attest to the fact that Han Solo is actually the weakest part of that movie next to the ewoks. Same as Jack sparrow until the series was actually tailored around him he made the series worse the more he was there. Case I'm trying to make LESS is MORE.Alan might be funny to some people, but he essentially ruins any believability in the movies. Granted in the first one he was a nice guy and was loyal. He was dumb, sweet, and awkward, but there was redeeming qualities about him. Now he's just a jerk. There's nothing to like every problem the main characters have is because of him after Hangover 1. Now this wouldn't be such a big problem except all the jokes in Hangover Part II are tailored around him and Chow. I love a lot of things about both this and Hangover Part II. They are significantly darker and have a lot more realism then the first movie. Which totally gets undercut by having alan and Chang in ever scene acting impossibly over the top and stupid. I like that this is basically a thriller and that the laughs aren't as important, but even then the thriller aspects aren't handled very well. The Best Hangover movies right now are Hangover 1, Pain and Gain, and Horrible Bosses. There's your trilogy 3 great movies which understand story structure and dark humor and silly absurd humor. We all know these obligatory sequels are impossible to get away from. Catch it at Redbox you might enjoy it more.",4,1,2,28 May 2013
