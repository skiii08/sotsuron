Stop-Loss," Fighting for your freedom (?) but not their own.
","This is a surprisingly good film about the effects of war on young minds, brainwashing and the illusion of freedom.Brandon doesn't return to the front because he believes it's the right thing to do but because he doesn't want to be on the run for the rest of his life. He's caught in a well-laid trap.Why they opted for Mexico had to be to help make the final 'decision' easier; any idiot would have opted to head back to Toronto since that was the best and original plan. Mexico? Abbie Cornish is sexy (I've never seen her before) but she really was sexier than sexy in this no sex, no nudity film. Beautiful, caring and cool. I admired her subtext. I realized later that it was because she acted HUMAN rather than like a female. She didn't act like a GIRL stereotype or a GUY, she acted like a PERSON. Very charming and unusual.The one scene that bothered me was when Brandon was on the ground getting kicked by 3 guys then gets up and kicks their asses. That's unrealistic and might convince some young nut to JOIN the army (to learn to fight) rather than run in the other direction. I had an experience with 'An Officer And A Gentleman' when I was young and stupid where I wound up at the recruiters the next day and, fortunately, didn't sign when common sense prevailed. Some of these films (like 'Top Gun') may be subtle recruitment films that draw enlisters for the wrong reasons.The scene I DID love was when Phillipe and Cornish left Rodriguez and the smile on his face dropped away and we realized he was giving us a positive spin on a worse than lousy situation.Interesting that they cast Timothy Oliphant as the charming Sarge who brings in enlisters, employing friendship and charm rather than the realities of war.Then the excellent fight in the cemetery with independent thinker Brandon versus 'bought the brainwashing' Steve who just doesn't get it. That's the problem with every army, they want the soldiers to be smart enough to fight but not smart enough to break ranks and walk away.",Null,0,0,8 November 2009
Se7en," In the beginning, there was darkness...
","Without conflict, there is no drama. You have to give this film credit, there's no lack of conflict.The first dialogue we hear is when the less competent detective tells the extra-competent detective (Freeman) that his question is stupid and he's glad he's leaving the force. That's 'envy' speaking, by the way, between members of the same caste, 'The Detectives'.Somerset and Mills don't get along; Tracy and David, the Lovers, greet each other at the door with 'Hi, loser' and 'Hi, idiot'. Love, exciting and new...'sWAT comes before dicks'. Every individual branch of 'The Force' has a problem of caste with every other branch- the uniforms and dicks have little respect for each other, the dicks and sWAT are battling for precedence, like nerds and jocks, with the jocks calling for the nerds when they find themselves in over their 'brawn, no brain' heads. Conflict.I've seen this film before and I've always been a fan of the comedy moments. I like when Mills takes his tie off the hanger already knotted, when he brings Somerset a full glass of wine (with Somerset's reaction) and when Mills wakes up and finds himself leaning on Somerset. These are the moments when you wonder, was that in the script or did they add it while shooting? Mills gets CLIFFNOTES of the classics with a shout of 'Good work, officer!' juxtaposed with 'Poetry writing faggot', the multitude of air-fresheners in the 'Sloth' crime scene. Can you write that stuff? The rain and darkness of the cinematography were perfect.Weaknesses (only 2): Yes, the scene between Paltrow and Freeman was there only to set up the ending. It isn't realistic to tell your husband's partner that you're pregnant before you tell your husband. As real as that may be in a shitworld, it's artificial and plot-serving.Mills is being set up as some sort of out-of-town wunderkind without any explanation, justification or background. Though Pitt is brilliant, Mills is not and I wonder, how did he ever solve a case back home?End of weaknesses. Enough with the weaknessess. But did Jonathan Doe kill the dogs, too? Those rambunctious Dobermans?Kevin Spacey is excellent as the strings-pulling dark messiah; his 'Dark Genius' is superior to the 'Light Genius' of Freeman which is it's own statement with Jonathan Doe sacrificing his life in the name of Dark Truth. 'Light' delays 'Darkness' but can't stop it.The sWAT team was presented as a bunch of faux-macho idiots with all their 'stupid authority' posturing and intimidation yelling/swearing which is fine but why weren't they wearing helmets? Was this some vanity on the part of the sWAT actors? 'Listen, Mr. Fincher, me and the guys were talking and my girlfriend may not be able to see my face when I yell 'Get up, you sack of crap!' if I have a sWAT helmet on. And it's raining, too, and it might be uncomfortable and I gave myself a CREWcut and you won't be able to even TELL, if I have the helmet on, see.'",Null,0,0,6 October 2009
Yes Man," You make me laugh, ha, ha!
","The TRAILer of this film made me laugh. That face JC makes, when he's telling the lovely Korean girl (Vivian Bang) that his friend's fiancée hates him, is fantastic and you can tell Vivian is really laughing.A lot of actors/directors believe in letting the comedy of the moment speak for itself via natural acting and that's fine. But it's Carrey's style and gift to make a funny moment funnier by being silly that makes you laugh instead of THINKing about laughing.I like to laugh. I also like to think but I do enough of that on my own. I prefer Jim's comic efforts more than the 'Truman Show' and 'Eternal Sunshine' and other more serious efforts. I loved the 'Series Of Unfortunate Events' which allowed his acting genius to shine, where he could be diverse, dark and comic.Yes, some of Carrey's films are formulaic but whose aren't? It's his ability to break the formula from within the formula that makes him Jim Carrey.Yes, Jim Carrey is getting older. Who isn't? He's still ten thousand times funnier than the geniuses who are saying 'Hey, he's getting older' as if everyone else is getting younger.The people who made comments about the age difference between JC and Deschanel weren't 20 years old, they were 40 year old female actresses and their beauticians.On the other hand, people are complaining about the octogenarian sex. Was it vital to the plot? No. Did Carl/Jim instigate it? No. Was he a bit repulsed by it? Yes. Was it uncomfortable? Yes. Was it human? Yes. It's unfortunate that old people are still horny, that bankers and governments are corrupt, that humans aren't monogamous- but that's life and life isn't always about the comfortable and politically correct. It's boringly typical that people are upset that an old woman is horny; if it had been an old man, it would have been cliché or ignored. Alan Arkin is horny in 'Little Miss Sunshine' and that's OK but old Tillie is a little bored and randy and it's inappropriate. Old women get horny, too. Zooey Deschanel's anger at Carl's 'yes-ism' seemed contrived. In a real situation, he should have let her walk and waited till she called him- which she would have in time. Guys- wake up!This is a cute, funny, positive film with a message of life and moderation AND it takes the time to ridicule the terror situation in America. For that reason, if for no other, it should be praised.",Null,0,1,22 September 2009
Watchmen," Be sober and watch...
","I did read 'Watchmen' when it first came out but I wasn't amazingly impressed by it. Best 'graphic novel' of all time? Really? I may have been too young to appreciate it, 22 or so. (I'm re-reading it now and it really is ground-breaking. I WAS too young or stupid.)In the comic, there was more of an emphasis on 'The End Is Near' doom-sayers in the streets with only one example in the film, the billboard that the unmasked Rorschach carries. OK, 2 examples.To me, the movie came off as a superhero soap opera with some dark moments and bone-crunching. Rorshach and The Comedian were dark and driven and gave good performances.There seemed a huge contradiction at the end where Doc Manhattan acknowledged that he couldn't change human nature but that if no one told the truth about the nuclear event, peace would reign. Depending on your point of view, war is in the hands of mankind, God or the gods and presumably, if human nature doesn't change then we can expect war to pick up again after everyone catches their collective breath. World peace is a pipe dream and if Doc Manhattan buys it, he's not too bright.Since the ax I like to grind is male/female relationships and the lies we tell ourselves re: that subject, I have to say I was astounded by the fight/rape scene between the Comedian and Miss Jupiter. He says 'yes', she says 'no' and gives him a powerful sock to the jaw with all the usual Hollywood sound-effects. He falls to the ground. In any other film, he'd get up, say '...but, BAbydoll..', rub his jaw and walk out angrily. Not here.The Comedian punches her in the stomach, gets up and hits her twice (?) in the face, HARD, kicks her while she's down then picks up her up, slams her into a pool table and smashes her face on the table.Huh? Life is complex and I'm not an advocate of easy solutions. I don't believe in male violence against women or female violence against men. Both genders are violent, stupid and emotional and men are usually stronger.HOWEVER, I was astounded to see a scene in a Hollywood film where a woman strikes the first blow, as is often the case, and the man gets up and beats the crap out of her. Do I advocate it? No. But, here in this fantasy film, we are seeing more realism than all the other idiotic films where a woman hits a man, knocks him down and he gets up and apologizes to her.A woman hits a man and a man hits her back, beating her up! A Hollywood revelation! THEN, we find out that she has sex with him years later, consensual presumably, that they conceive a child and that the Comedian has warm feelings for the grown-up daughter, which the aging, possibly jealous, wife attacks as sexual when they probably aren't. (There are also about 214 visual cues that the Comedian is in love with Miss Jupiter but doesn't express it very well.)A rape scene where a woman gets beat up followed years later by consensual sex.THEN, Miss Jupiter graces us with the well-observed revelation that '...the future keeps getting darker while the past, even the grimy parts, get lighter.' She then feeds us the pap that she's thankful for the Comedian for giving her a daughter but there's no acknowledgment of why she went to a man who tried to rape her to conceive that daughter.The message here is undesirable but clear. Miss Jupiter is sexually intrigued by the Comedian because of, or despite, his violence. When she hit him in the rape scene she probably got more in return than she bargained for but, if it's reasonable for her to hit him, it's reasonable that he'll hit her back and defeat her.Is the Comedian a good guy? Well, he may be an anti-hero, a sign of the times but he's no hero. The pregnant Vietnamese woman rips his face with a beer bottle and he kills her. Was it a reasonable reaction on his part? No. Was it a reasonable ACTION on her part? No, it was a stupid action and she paid the ultimate price.Hollywood owes me an apology for making me thankful for a scene where a woman hits a man (Miss Jupiter) and he actually HITS HER BACK. It's DARK, it's SCARY but it's realism.You can't cry out for the end of domestic violence while female characters in Hollywood are knocking out men with a right hook. What kind of message does THAT send?",Null,0,1,27 September 2009
Van Helsing," Great entertainment and comic acting/writing.
","The first time we see Kate Beckinsale in this film, the camera is on her fanny as she's turning. That illustrates the tone for this film, I'd guess.This is a fun movie, mostly because of the fantastic castings of Richard Roxburgh and David Wenham, but the whole thing is shot with humor.My favorite exchange in this film is between Van Helsing and Dracula near the end: Drac: You are too late, my friend. My children live.VH: Then the only way to kill them is to kill you.Drac: Correct.H. Jackman laughs and I wonder if he was laughing at Roxburgh's Thomas Lennon/Marty Feldman-ish delivery of 'correct'. Roxburgh switches from evil to humor with abandon and he may be the best part of the film.'Van Helsing' is beautifully shot, sexy, funny, has great effects and it does give a nice nod to the James Bond/'Q' relationship.I'd heard bad things about this film but always wanted to see it; now I wish I'd seen it sooner.",Null,0,1,22 August 2009
Gran Torino," Clint Eastwood mows the lawn, fixes the clothes dryer.
","'Gran Torino' is a funny movie. There are comments that it is a 'racist' film but it's a film about racism which you can't make without racists.Monsieur Eastwood found all sorts of opportunities to be funny but I liked when he found himself in the neighbor's basement with a bunch of kids, leaned against an unlevel dryer, got down and adjusted it. That was a beautiful, almost embarrassing, funny 'old man' moment that was unexpected and so real. The machine is unlevel, get down and fix it. Totally unimportant to the scene but perfect.'Watch out for Mr. Kowalski. He'll beat up your cousin, fix your dryer and make you like it.' There were some improbable scenes in this film like Walt being able to get close enough to the gangster to throw him down the stairs and the gangsters not spotting his white Ford pickup tailing them or across the street. Whatever. It was worth it to watch him mow the lawn.Though it was a set-up for a joke, I could have lived without the barber-shop scene where Thau is being trained to trash-talk. But this is a film where Eastwood is playing an imperfect character who smokes, drinks, hates people and can't express his emotions except with negativity. He's playing the nasty, old racist next door and he does it well. Perfect characters make for boring films. And the punchline really was pretty good.It was a great moment when he spat with disdain at the old Hmong woman and she out-spit him. God knows what she was spitting and it's unlikely that Walt would chew AND smoke but it was funny anyway.When the Hispanics brought out their gun and the Hmong brought out their machine gun, that was funny. CE didn't shy away from finding humor in subtle places. Both the Hmong and Hispanic car drivers where wearing the same headbands in the same style.Since the gangs may have been a metaphor for street soldiers, it's interesting that they started out defending Thau and tried to indoctrinate him but were ultimately a badguy gang of cowards.Someone has said that Clint is playing a character here who supports war but that's not the message I got. Walt seemed to regret his memories of the war and participation in it.C.Eastwood really is perfect in this film and the supporting players were understated and natural.Walt didn't miss a philosophical beat dealing with Thau's immature idea that they were going to find the gangsters, do some damage and come home unscathed. That only happens 'in the movies'. Walt uses some tricky maneuvering to utilize the 'never around when you need them' police and legal system to get the gangsters off the scene, save Thau and gracefully put himself out of his own 'dying in an oncology ward' misery.Walt sticks to his guns and, though he softens, he never gives in to the priestly pap but winds up teaching the priest instead. Maybe Walt learns something about forgiveness but the priest also learns how little HE knows about reality. Walt compromised without giving in. Wow.Since the movie moves along as movies do without giving you much time to think, I didn't realize that Walt was getting a suit fitted for his own funeral. It's the kind of detail that they throw in, don't comment on and leave you to realize at your leisure. They could have thrown in some line from the tailor to make us question why Walt is getting a DARK suit fitted but they didn't and I completely missed the point until later. It was perfectly done since it didn't give away Walt's plan unless you're smarter than I am which isn't unlikely. I missed it.This is a well-written script shot simply and acted amazingly well.",Null,1,8,21 October 2009
The Wrestler," One full-nelson with a side of despair , please.
","It's funny to see that almost every film you read about, someone SOMEwhere thinks it's the worst film ever made. 'The Wrestler' may be the truest film ever made, which is why it's so damn depressing and so good.Todd Barry, as Wayne, the supermarket manager, was the best, slightly over-the-top PRICK I've seen lately in a film. His performance seemed like something you'd find in 'The Young Ones', something on the line between believable and unbelievable. That 'The Ram' had to take crap from this nasty little squid was humiliating. The only consolation was that Wayne was probably as depressed, or more, as Randy.After the Ram agrees to work behind the deli counter, we see him take the long walk through the employee room, down the stairs, through the warehouse and the plastic curtain where we see him wash his hands. That's what's at the heart of this film, the goodness of Ram's character- he's walking through hell and he washes his hands, like the good person/employee he is. Wearing his 'Robin' badge. Wow.At the 'autograph-signing event', the crowd has died down and the Ram is looking around at the other has-been wrestling stars. The shot ends on the urine bag (or whatever you call it) attached to his fellow's leg. Suicide, anyone? Which really is the point of this film. The Ram knows his glory days are past and when the doctor tells him that continuing in the ring may kill him, you can see him thinking. What does he have to live for? He's living a life without love, he's past his prime and he's broke. What's the point? When he decides to do the rematch for no $$ is it because he wants to wrestle or because he sees it as the best possible 'out'? 'A little more, a little less, a little more...'. This is a comedic scene but it isn't played for comedy, they play it for real. So, it's funny while you're trying not to kill yourself in recognition of The Ram's crappy reality. It's the message at the heart of the search for security, 'Yay, Im working more hours, I can pay my bills, someone please shoot me, put me out of my misery.' This is why the Ram went into wrestling, to avoid the despair of the 'secure' life.Mickey Rourke underplays his whole performance which is why it's so powerful, probably, but the beauty of the film is indicated when Cassidy is giving him a lapdance and he's reminiscing about the old times and dreaming of future possibilities. He's there for her company, not for the minor thrill of having her undulate before him.Of course, Marisa looks fantastic but God bless her for playing a part where she takes off her clothes and no one is whistling, no one cares. Mickey compliments her on her sexiness as an afterthought; she's bored, he's bored, everybody's just struggling to maintain some self-respect or a positive thought, pay the rent, stay in working shape.Cassidy's lucky, she has a 9 year old to worry about but The Ram's daughter is old enough to take care of herself; he's just looking for a reason to keep on living.The visual style of this film, or lack of it, only serves to emphasize the gritty, bleakness of the Ram's meaningless world.Good film, powerful; not one likely to replace 'It's A Wonderful Life' as easy inspiration, but inspirational anyway, in it's horrible, 'what do I have to live for?' fashion.",Null,1,1,23 August 2009
Hitch," 'Dating is impossible in a post-feminist world', she said.
","I have to give this film credit for trying since, in my opinion, the following exchange at the climax of the film IS the climax of the film. At the speed-dating night, Eva Mendes says to Hitch: Eva: You're a scam artist. You trick women into...Hitch: ...into getting OUT OF THEIR OWN WAY so that great guys like Albert Brennaman have a fighting chance.The message of this film is that lonely women who are looking for love can't find it because they make it so difficult for men to do all the work that guys need help to get past the intimidation/rejection/game-playing factor. Enter Hitch, the 'dating scam-artist with a heart', the 'how to pick up any woman' guy who only works with those looking for love, not sex. It's a cute movie but not the one it could have been.How many times do we have to see a girl kneeing a guy in the crotch? Did the bad guy deserve it? Not really. But the real problem is, he never sees it coming. If Mendes had tried to kick Kevin James in the crotch, he might have fallen for it. The guy she DOES knee in the crotch was a dick, had experience, and would have seen it coming and kneed HER in the crotch. He winds up with his head up the bull's ass which is a funny shot but not funny enough to endure another 'knee in the crotch' scene.Hitch says '...if you've been to high school (clue!) you know that girls hitting guys is a good thing'. That would have been great if he'd added '...until two years into marriage when the guy gets tired of it and hits her back and winds up in jail then divorce court' or '...until 3 weeks later when the guy dumps you and you can't figure out why.' No real man is going to let a girl hit him, publicly or privately, and if you let her get away with it, she'll think you're a passive idiot. This is one of the 119 things this film DOESn't know about relationships. Fortunately, the film suggests that women don't know anything about men, either, or they wouldn't be so lonely/dissatisfied. When Adam Arkin's wife tells him to shut up at the food event, I'd love to have seen him say '...why don't YOU shut up, darling?' then continue on.Because that's another aspect of this film. It's not just about the difficulty of making contact with the opposite gender, it's also about why men don't WANT to make contact, why men in particular don't WANT commitment (besides the financial factor). This film says it's OK to knee men in the crotch if you don't like them, hit them when you DO like them and tell them to 'shut up' at public gatherings. What they don't show you is the 'hiring a divorce lawyer' scene.Hitch seduces Mendez by creepily getting too much information about her, hiring waterskis and messengers with walky-talkies and gifts. Overkill. If his character knew anything about women, he wouldn't bother trying so hard.Hitch recognizes his own fear of being hurt and rushes to Mendez' apartment where he forgets everything he ever knew and makes an idiot out of himself which is supposed to be endearing. If all of Hitch's knowledge of women doesn't allow him to get her to acknowledge her own mistakes then he and Eva are probably doomed, too. Yes, Eva tried to apologize in a previous scene but the writers manage to make her do it without making a total idiot out of herself.It was just another example of the problem to have Mendes continue to play games with Hitch by letting him assume that her brother-in-law was her lover. For Hitch to continue chasing her at that point was stupid.In the end, Hitch is a good guy who changes a little and Eva is an 'I've been hurt by men and it's all their fault' girl and she changes a little. Does she ever suspect that her major problem with men is herself/her tactics/her games? Almost, maybe, kinda, sorta...probably not really.This film tries to say that a major obstacle in the relationship sphere is that women play too many games. I give it credit for that. I wish it had gone a little further. It might have been more relevant.The interesting, almost unspoken message of this film is that both Mendes and Hitch are angry at the other gender and both are trying to help their own gender either by 'winning' (Hitch) or by 'warning' (Mendes). Meanwhile, both have opted to back out of the commitment scene. Both sides are angry but can't figure out why. It's because they're playing a game where the rules keep changing and both teams are cheating and so no one can win. It's a crooked game played on a field where the grass is always greener on the other side of commitment.In one of the 'extra features', a female dating expert says 'when you're talking to a girl and her friend at a bar you have to buy them both drinks'. HA! I'm suspecting that she's 'the friend' a lot because no one would buy anyone a drink to talk to her. She's the type of 'men pay, women take' dating expert who keep men out of relationships.",Null,0,0,21 August 2009
