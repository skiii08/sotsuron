Blade Runner 2049," The film by itself is beautiful but the story is unneeded
","--- Contains spoilers about the prequel as well as the sequel ---I have always been a huge fan of the original Blade Runner movie, and how well it captures the themes of mortality, existence, (imperfect) human nature, etc. in such a concise and beautiful way. I also loved how differently the plot could be read. I'm not even getting into the ambiguity in whether Deckard was a replicant or not, but I really loved how difficult it was to read most characters' intentions and emotions. I feel that these ambiguities has been destroyed by the sequel. Other than being a very well directed and acted visual feast, this movie doesn't really add more to the philosophical discussion than the first one. It showcases Deckard to be some sort of a selfless visionary, which is in contrast with his questionable ethical choices in the prequel, and more so in the Philip K. Dick novel. I also didn't see the point of the scene where K talks to Gaff in a retirement home. Maybe they just wanted to honor Edward James Olmos.What I did love, however, was how that single piano note that was repeated all throughout the movie turned into the original Vangelis tune that accompanied Roy Batty's 'tears in rain' monologue/poem at the very end, while K was dying. I also loved the visuals, despite the fact that the film certainly wasn't 'noir' anymore. I love how Villeneuve builds up the tension in critical moments in the plot by having the character and/or the camera move very slowly into the point where something important is to be revealed. I also thought Ryan Gosling's delivery was on point -- he showed no emotion until the moment where he thought he realized he was the child who grew up in the orphanage and that the memory was originally his. As a long time fan of Harrison Ford, I was delighted to see once again so much emotion delivered without much dialogue but gestures and expressions.Overall, the movie by itself was really good, but I cannot help but wish that it was not a sequel, but an unrelated, standalone movie. But, if it *really* had to be done, I'm glad it was left in the hands of Denis Villeneuve.",7,0,2,20 October 2017
