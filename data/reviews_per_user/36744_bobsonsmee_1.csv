Resident Evil: Afterlife," Truly dire
","This film is so bad that it's not even possible to mentally frame it as a comedy. The visuals are ugly, the dialogue is tripe, the acting is awful, the story is nonsense. And it features the usual, tired, old 3D gimmicks: weapons and debris being hurled directly at the camera every five minutes.I enjoyed the first two movies in the Resident Evil series, but Afterlife really is terrible.",1,2,6,30 September 2017
