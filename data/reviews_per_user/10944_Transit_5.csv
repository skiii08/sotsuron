The Blair Witch Project," Innovative technique. Not quite as good as it could be done.
","I spent a surprising amount of time trying to decide how I felt about this movie. It was not the scariest film of the year, nor even the scariest film of the month in which it was released, If you're looking for pure chills or something that will make you scream along with the protagonists, you won't find it here. It is, however, quite entertaining, and disturbing in a fashion that falls in the general realm of terror. The choice of storytelling medium is the instrumental deciding factor in making this film worth the price of admission (or of rental). It is such a total departure from typical Hollywood glamour and high tech fests that it imparts a deep sense of realism that could never be achieved by any other means, no matter how sophisticated the industry becomes. But the decision to use 'amateur footage' as the sole medium for the storyline is paradoxically both the strong point and the greatest weakness of this film. First, the story couldn't work any other way without a serious rewrite. It would be too hokey any way but the way in which it's presented. But in the form of 'real life' footage, it works. At times, the effort to make the footage look sufficiently amateurish to seem real is strained and in some cases overdone. At others, the very unprofessionalism is what makes it so moving. For instance, Heather's taped apology to their parents. Bad camera angle, no obvious makeup, bloodshot eyes, and a shot so unglamourous that even when you've read the disclaimer of fictionality, you still think for a moment... 'are you sure this isn't real?'But the most critical decision point is whether we believe that all of this would make it onto film. There is a pivotal scene in which Josh condemns Heather for 'still making movies' when they are lost in the woods. She replies, tearfully, 'It's all I have, okay?' Miss that scene, and you'll never stand any chance of believing that so much of this story 'realisticly' made it onto film. Simply put, these are aspiring film makers whose life training has made it a deeply engrained habit to film everything. That's as close as you'll get to an explanation for the completeness of the film records here. Still, it's a tough sell. There are things you still can't believe got on film, yet without these scenes, the story would lose a lot in thetranslation. That's the double edged sword: show too much, you lose that natural realism, show too little, you lose the story itself. Clearly the film's producers were treading a thin line here.It worked. Just about. But there was still room for improvement.",7,0,1,26 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good set up for II & III, leaves plenty of mysteries.
","What both bothered and fascinated me is the number of mysteries this movie set up, however. I say 'bothered', but I mean it in a good way. The kind of way that makes you say, 'How fast can they come out with II & III?'All in all, the story is a good beginning that quite appropriately leaves gaps into which many additional pieces must fall for the tale to be complete, and yet, it is a story which can stand alone in and of itself --- for now. In the image of Episode IV (the original Star Wars), it contains a complete-in-itself story which is nonetheless part of a larger epic. An excellent first chapter for a classic saga.There is only one reason I can think of for the critics to pan this movie: pre-release hyper-hype. It is clear that if you build a movie up as greatly as this one was built up, it's sure to stir the cynical juices in people who were just hoping to find something wrong with it.Now, as to the movie: beautiful work. Absolutely beautiful.Well worth the money to see it, even if you're just a casual fan (are there any?) There were awesome special effects, yes, but there were also astonishingly subtle touches, like the 'crackling' in the film, and the ocassional bit of 'lint in the camera lens' effect, that I've actually heard people complaining about as if it were a flaw. I can't say I've checked it out on every screen in every theatre, but I'm 90% sure those 'flaws' would be in every copy, since they appear to be deliberate finishing touches introduced by post processors to give the story more of a 'long ago in a galaxy far far away' feel. I smiled when I heard people complaining, as I remember seeing similar effects in the original Star Wars, and I could hardly believe they did it, myself.As for my part, I loved the characters (even Jar Jar, whom so many seem to despise --- every action movie needs a comic relief to keep the audience sane in the midst of so much tension). I was kind of shocked by critics who implied Jar Jar's people were promoting racial stereotypes. I mean, DUH! Part of the movie implied they were typically treated as inferiors, and in turn bore no love for the Naboo. By the end of the film, this situation turns around in a very positive manner. That is, if you haven't already tuned it out because you've made up your mind to hate it before you walked in the theatre.The same can be said for most of the critical comments I've heard. If you even just LIKE Star Wars, see this film. It will astound you.",10,0,0,5 June 1999
The Green Mile," One miracle short...
","The Green Mile is a picture about miracles which comes up one miracle short. John Coffey, a simple man with supernatural talents comes up with miracles for all whom he is called upon to help... except himself. Wrongfully convicted of an unspeakable murder, one keeps hoping for a better ending,though perhaps, as we get to know him, we come to agree with his own assessment that this end is only merciful. His obvious talent for healing is mixed with the subtler, and ultimately more torturous ability to see into the souls of others, no matter how dark the vision may be.Yet, if that were all there was to this picture, it would be a simplistic story, more worthy of a half hour run on the Twilight Zone than a 3 hour movie. The development and interplay of characters is what cunningly blinds you to the passing of time as you watch it. There is a tinge of mystery in the beginning, an unexpectedly emotional reaction to an old film which waits until nearly the end for its explanation. While you seek it, you meet characters who evoke a range of emotions from respect to sympathy, and in a couple cases disgust. You cannot quite say that each of these receives precisely as he deserves, for this would not be so, but then, it is not so in life too many times either. There are a few surprise twists, and even once theinitial mystery from the beginning is solved, there is still a slight twist at the end, as if to remind you who wrote this tale.There are tiny elements from time to time that seem incongruous to the time frame of the plot, but on the whole, so minor that unless you go through it looking for them, you'll likely never notice. On the whole, The Green Mile is by and large the best picture this year. If this one doesn't take awards, the awards are an empty exercise.",10,0,1,7 January 2000
Final Destination," Looking forward to the remake, anyway...
","Horror? Well, no. Not really. Final Destination manages to be horrifying only in a scene or two throughout its plot, though it is scary in its own way. The obsessive use of symbols and references to death would actually have been clever if it wasn't used somewhat heavy handedly at points. Some of the character relationships just don't make sense, and could have used more background to develop them. And the whole deal about the FBI trying to pin the death of his friends on the protagonist, who is convinced he's found 'death's pattern' and is working to beat it just never quite worked for me, which is just as well, since it would have been too predictable anyway.I did like the overall concept, though. Don't get me wrong on that. So often to we hear and use the term 'cheating death' that it is refreshing to see death doesn't always take it lying down. <g> And by eschewing the temptation to make death a personified figure and instead using wild, chaotic forces in the world around us as the agents of death's plan, Final Destination managed to be scarier than a typical slasher style movie would have ever managed. In fact, if only I had felt more for the characters, and understood better their relationships, I might actually have loved this movie.As it is, I am eagerly looking forward to some future film making genius remaking it someday.",6,0,0,16 April 2000
The Matrix," A worthwhile piece of science fiction entertainment.
","The non-spoiler part of the comments...Matrix manages to effectively combine two or three rudimentary sci-fi concepts with some (not too scary) existential philosophy to produce a movie whose first twenty to thirty minutes (unless you've heard the plot) will have you wondering just what exactly is happening, and surprise you when you finally find out. It's strengths are a plot which requires the viewer to think a bit to work out what's happening (but not so much you walk away shaking your head in puzzlement), blending into a more straight Authority vs. Rebels action film in the latter parts, and some extremely impressive special effects which make the whole thing work well. It's only real weakness is a few cliches that might make the more picky viewers roll their eyes, but hey, like they say, there is nothing wholly new under the sun. Matrix manages to make those cliches its own, and cross them in new ways that the less than totally cynical will find well worth the price of admission.SPOILER HATERS STOP HERE.* * * * *I liked the deliberate plays on our sense of reality. For example (paraphrasing, maybe badly) 'deja-vu is a glitch inthe matrix. It happens when They change something', and 'you're here because you sense there's something wrong. You can't define it but there it is like a splinter in your mind's eye.' How many of us haven't felt deja-vu, or felt that alienated sense of being strangers in a world that's not really our own? Matrix seizes this peculiar paranoid angst that has become so prevalent in our 20th century lives and provides us with an (albeit fantastical) explanation that forms the essence of the plot. It gives a new spin to the increasingly ubiquitous 'Men in Black' and the new tendency to mistrust Authority, rather than simply questioning it. It also hits you with the biggies of philosophy: What is Reality? If you couldn't tell the dream from waking, is it still a dream? And most potentially devastatingly of all WOULD it really matter? If you want to see some very clever special fx, and you're not afraid to think just a little, see The Matrix.",Null,0,0,9 May 1999
