Despicable Me 2," Despicable world saving me
","Despicable Me 2 is a great movie for a whole family to enjoy at a movie theater.This animation is about a former super-villain, Gru, and his little yellow minions who speak a whole different language, but really help and are a life saver. There is Steve Carell, playing that funny accented voice of Gru. Then there is of course Kristen Wiig playing that girly-ish voice of Lucy.Gru is recruited to the Anti Victim League (AVL) and he must save the world from a super dangerous serum that turns animals into into industructible ,eating machines. he eventually proved himself correct to the AVL when he solved a mystery by himself and he saved the whole world.",10,1,2,5 July 2013
Skyfall," Best Bond Yet
","James bond operates on a mission to kill a bad guy who seems to be able to hack everything. One of the best parts of the movie came in the very be beginning that always catches my eye in bond moves especially Casino Royale which I recommend seeing. in this beginning scene bond is running after a person who is probably a criminal and he gets on a train and starts wrestling this criminal, and in the meantime his partner on the job is trying to get a good shot on the criminal. then she takes a risky move and shoots... it hits bond he goes down criminal gets away and how did bond survive after the shot and falling to the bottom of a body of water ? no one even the creators probably don't know so. but to the story Daniel Craig playing James bond is extraordinary in the movie and Judy Dench playing m was great. Speaking of M she has a amazing dramatic part in the end where the hacking criminal kills her and then bond gets the criminal back with a throwing knife, you should really see it . these two make a great pair and showed it in Skyfall. another thing is I love the song. I don't understand why so many people hated it I thought it was amazing",10,9,14,21 November 2014
Gravity," Gravity brought itself down
","Gravity was a movie of suspense that was highly anticipated and had great reviews, but the truth is, it shouldn't.'Gravity' is interesting all to about half way through the movie. It was really awesome how Ryan Stone( Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) where out in space when disaster struck. Debris from spacecrafts that got destroyed going around 20,000 miles an hour causing chain reactions of other spacecrafts. Ryan Stone and Matt kowalski must survive that deadly orbit and somehow get back to earth. But all the sudden, when it seems like both of them are safe but then while they are landing they can not stop themselves from crashing hard into the spacecraft they planned to escape in. Matt kowalski must let go and pretty much kill himself in order for Ryan Stone to survive or else both of them not to die. Ryan stone ends up being the lone surviver but living.I recommend this movie to people who like suspense.I rate this movie a 54 out of one hundred. because it was really repetitive an d you really saw the same movie twice.",5,3,6,14 October 2013
This Is the End," this will blow you away
","'This is the end' will certainly bring you to heaven. This is the end is about five friend actors; Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, and Danny McBride. They are trying to survive an apocalypse of the world together in James Franco's mansion. they must live on two big bottles of water, and a king size breakfast that Danny cooks all in one day. it all starts out seeming like an earthquake, but then while Seth Rogen and Jay Bruchel are in a convenience store buying cigarettes these blue beams started to take people up to the sky, those beams happened to actually be taking them up to heaven. later in the movie at the end, all of the friends (except for Danny McBride) are trying to make it to heaven,in the end everybody except James Franco makes it to heaven. If you like comedies i recommend this movie to you.I rat this movie a 74 out of one hundred.",7,2,7,12 October 2013
World War Z," Scary, scary, scary, zombies
","World war z is very, very scary(living up to it's expectations, and a lot more) but besides Brad Pitt as main character soldier Gerry, (who had a absolute stellar performance in my opinion) the movie was a huge bust for me.The pretty much only absolute good part about the movie was Brad Pitt's performance. Brad Pitt plays a father from the U.N. who is forced to fight in war against the over-powering zombies. Pitt's character always kept the movies having action. like the part he grenades the plane, or when he walks by all the zombies after he injects himself with a disease.I give this movie a 2.7 out of ten . I was very disappointed with this movie.",3,4,8,1 July 2013
42," A truly inspirational film
","42 is a documentary of the first black man of baseball 'the great Jackie Robinson.This documentary tells about very little the baseball of his life, but mostly about the touching part about his racial life and how that effected him and made him so sensational.Chadwick Boseman does a great acting job with the role of Jackie Robinson, and the role of Branch Rickey played by Harrison Ford is also amazing. These two actors worked very smoothly together and that is a big reason why this movie was so great.I give this movie an 8.4 out of 10, and I certainly recommend this movie to sports lovers.",8,0,0,7 July 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," star trek into the greatness
","Star trek into darkness is action packed, emotional, and a great family movie.There has been star trek shows and movies for a long time, but this has to be one of the best that has ever been made.One reason for that is because of the amazing acting. There was the main character captain Kirk played as Chris Pine did a great job. Then there is Zachary Quinto who played the role of Spock, the never lying, serious partner of captain kirk. Together they made the movie outstanding.I give this movie a 7.2 out of ten and I definitely recommend this movie to anyone.",7,1,4,3 July 2013
Ted," Funny, really funny.
","I am very happy I saw this movie.It is funny, to be exact, hilarious. Here is the story of a living teddy bear escaping an evil dad and son who are trying to capture and kidnap him. One of the ending scenes really sets the whole movie off. Great effects, but at the same time really emotional, for example, where Ted fights to get away, desperately climbing up a tower to escape the maniac chasing him. If you want to just have a relaxing day with a movie, this is my recommendation for you.I give it a high, overall 7.4 rating.",7,0,3,9 December 2012
Man of Steel," Superman saves the earth... again
","Man of steel is an action packed thriller.Henry Cavill makes superman, into a superhuman, monster, hero. This of course makes it a spectacular movie. but the bad part about it was it was that there was way to much repetition , and predictability, it was just not as exciting as it should be, you just knew what was going to happen throughout the whole movie, and that took away all the fun about the movie that everyone loves.This movie could have been a lot better, and I mean a lot better.It was a pretty, pretty big disappointment.I give this movie a 6.3 out of 10.",6,0,2,1 July 2013
Now You See Me," where was the movie
","This is the end was overrated and though it wasn't the worst it certainly wasn't the best.It started out out with four magicians who don't find know each other but get a card from an anonymous person leading to a trail of mysterious lights that bring the four magicians i to a whole new life of fame and crime. They are huge hits known for somehow giving and stealing money, that ended up putting the person who tryed putting them out of business in jail. The police want to them in jail and somehow they don't even though they now who they are, what they look like, and there also famous but they pull it off thanks to one person the police agent in charge of capturing them.I recommend this movie to people who like action movies but i don't really recommend this movie.I rate this movie a 39 out of one hundred.",4,3,5,12 October 2013
Hoosiers," good but repetitive
","Hoosiers is a movie about a coach who makes a comeback with a Hickory high school team.In my opinion this movie was touching, but very, very, repetitive. The whole movie was about the coach getting ejected from the game, and Hickory winning every game. The rest of the movie was good. I personally liked the story line of the underdogs coming back.I am giving it a 5.5 out of ten.If it was not so repetitive I would give it an 8. But overall a pretty good movie.You should really give it a chance if you are a sports fan, and like underdog stories.",5,0,4,24 December 2012
X-Men: First Class," One of the best movies out there
","X-Men First Class is one of the best movies of all time. By far. Now I have never (until now) been an X-men Wolverine fan, but this film just blew me away.Another amazing thing about this movie is the absolutely unbelievable cast. It all starts with the star of the movie, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), who was great, but my favorite was Erik, played by Micheal Fassbender, who was mind-blowing. And nobody could forget Sebastian Shaw, played by the great actor Kevin Bacon. I am telling you the truth: I watched this movie at least four times and I will probably watch it again someday. I give this movie an 100 out of 10. And I am also telling you: Watch this movie. It is a great kids' movie, and good as a whole-family movie to watch.",10,0,1,12 January 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Got what i wanted.
","Batman, the Dark Knight Rises, is an awesome, exciting movie that ends sadly, where Batman makes his biggest decision yet.The movie is about how Bane, who is trying to destroy Batman and the city, eventually makes a bomb that is going to kill all the police.One of my favorite parts was when Batman was held in a prison, and you can escape by climbing a rock wall that was virtually impossible to scale, but the amazing Batman did the impossible once again, by climbing that wall! Now he has to complete a mission to stop Bane's horrible plan to set off this bomb. I also like the part when Bane announces something at a college football field, and the field collapses as a player is running for a touchdown, only to fall underground once he stops.Christian Bale as Batman, and Bane (Tom Hardy), are both magnificent actors in this movie.I give this movie 8.6 out of 10 stars. It is just excellent!",10,4,6,5 January 2013
Casino Royale," Great start to Daniel Craig's career
","Daniel Craig starts his James Bond career with Casino Royale, where he is in a battle with a terrorist leader. The beginning and ending scenes were both amazing, including a chase with a super-fast, athletic prisoner, and exploding a prison to escape from it.He does whatever he could to get a better idea about this person. From going into a random hotel and checking their security cameras, alone, without any permission, to hacking a computer of the super high-level person who is the leader of M16. This is a great start to Daniel Craig's hopefully long career in the James Bond business. He made a great impression with his acting skills in this movie.",8,1,4,1 December 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Great addition to the star wars family
","We've waited.... and waited..... and here it is! The Force Awakens is everything we've come to love about Star Wars. It's big, it's epic, it's spectacular. And underneath, there's actually a big heart to it all. You get a sense from watching it, that it was made by true fans of the series. I won't give away any real spoilers- but rest assured Jar Jar Binks does not put in an appearance, so remain calm. The good guys are very likable, I thought the relationship between Ray and Finn worked out very well. It gave the film it's emotional anchor. The villains are pretty much what you would expect, but the filmmakers threw in a few twists about them that were welcome.Add some terrific space battles, and you get a very welcome return to the greatness of Star Wars. Go and see it (but you already know you will). Take a friend or a family member. You'll have a great time. Because that's what these films are about when it comes down to it. Overall, Force Awakens shows off some snazzy visual effects combined with a compelling story and great characters. It won't disappoint.",10,26,69,16 December 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," keeps your attention seems like violent nascar
",Its a good idea making an all action movie thats all explosions and chasing but without a story it was just straight repetition. I didn't love how there wasn't a story but there might not be one single scene that was boring. I like the and furious movies better but this certainly could be just as good. I think other people would like this more than me as i was personally tired while watching so that might have taken away from it but i would definitely recommend it to most people I would rate this a 6.7/10 but you might give it a 10 Perfect if you like exciting or action movies or if you just want to be entertained,7,2,5,15 August 2015
Dodgeball," Great kids movie, very funny.
","Peter is an owner of a very average gym. But his rival gym is a super high-tech, fancy gym right across the corner.Peter must get 10,000 dollars to stop the evil owner of the other gym taking over his gym, and buying it. Peter, and his crew of people who go to his gym, see a dodge-ball tournament slot open for grabs. The prize: 10,000 dollars!Peter and his team barely make it through the first round, beating the Girl Scouts by disqualification because one of the Girl Scouts was using steroids. Ben Stiller is a great bad guy, and he proved it in this movie. It is very exciting to see Peter's team advance through the playoffs and eventually win the whole tournament.",10,0,1,2 December 2012
Furious 7," Even more fast and furious than the last one
","In this action packed movie about a family of speed racers and the criminals they face there is literally not one scene in the second half of the movie that you can take your eyes off of. they incorporate comedy into a movie about shooting and racing and it works perfectly.Now for the plot.Dominic Toretto is part of the fast and furious family. He seeks out a man named Deckard Shaw who is trying to kill him and the rest of the squad. The reason Shaw wants to kill them is because they killed Shaw's brother and he wants revenge. but Shaw is hard to find so the gang will need tools and the one gadget that can find anyone...' Gods Eye '. the team uses gods eye to track down Shaw but they don't kill him. Then Shaw gets the gadget and uses it to hunt the squad including a hacker called Ramsey. in the end they are in an explosive battle and Toretto and Shaw and in a big fist fight. I wont tell you who wins as you can probably guess, but during that fight Shaw's 'Sidekick' Jakarde is in a helicopter shooting and firing missiles at Ramsey to stop her from hacking his system and getting Gods Eye. The team pulls off stunts to keep her safe and end up finishing the hack. In the and all goes well and everyone lives happily ever after.I would give this a 10 out of 10 any day for sure as it filled all of its expectations R.I.P Paul Walker.",10,4,10,5 April 2015
