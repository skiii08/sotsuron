Hereditary," Should be a career ender
","I m not shocked to see raving reviews of this trash film. If you're cool with or apathetic to the evil this represents, I'm sure it's wonderful for you. The movie was nowhere close to the exorcist. The first half was slow and the family's reactions were subhuman at best to the tragedies that occurred. The last half was first dumb and without coherence, then just plain sick with gratuitous gore and heinous scenes that lead to the true evil of the film. There was no story and this was boring and offensive and should end the careers of all involved with it. There was no talent in producing this garbage.",Null,3,7,11 June 2018
