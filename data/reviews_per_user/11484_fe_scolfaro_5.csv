Source Code," Extremely well woven...
","Source Code is what 'Inception' aimed for, with added coherence and no plot holes that I can think of. Well worth the watch, it keeps the ball rolling in what seems to be a genre started by the 'Matrix' and a few less successful predecessors.The plot takes place in mental space, so to speak, like with the aforementioned titles, and as with both, there is little linearity in plot time. Somehow it also reminds me of 'Groundhog Day' and specially 'The Thirteenth Floor', again with added coherence as there are no questions left unanswered about 'why' or 'how' things were happening.If I had to pick one particularly good point about this movie, I'd say that the script was marvelously written, considering how the time line unravels and how the plot is conducted. The only negative thing about the whole experience is that it comes directly after 'Inception', and a lot of elements (specially the soundtrack) can be seen and heard there as direct 'consequences' of it, so I doubt it'll significantly impact the industry at this point in time. But other than that, the script itself makes it well worth the watch (irrespective of how it was executed).I give it an 8 for being a deeply enjoyable experience, although it should be noted that considering what was said above, it isn't revolutionary. As for the science aspect, if you know a little about quantum physics you'll understand why this movie is specially coherent and creative, and again, well worth the watch (not just for science fiction buffs).",8,0,1,11 June 2011
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Biggest Matrix spoof this side of Revolutions...
","Firstly, i'd like to explain why i rated this movie at 3 stars and not ZERO: 'cause it's really visually impressive, credit where credit's due. Just eye candy, from first to last minute. HOWEVER, that's all there is to it, as with many sci-fi wannabe hit movies, but with a sinister twist to it: absolutely no cohesion (visual progression/sets and general story-telling included).This movie would have generated 20 or 30 good trailers, as long as 2-3 min snippets were kept separate and no one actually watched the movie.Lastly, this is the movie that most boldly assumes the Matrix Trilogy has been either forgotten or remained unwatched by a younger generation. While i applaud the liberty taken to re-shoot bullet dodging scenes and 'bullet time', maybe as an attempt to break the monopoly of the famed -now classic- Trilogy over it, it deeply disgusts me that even the wardrobe is spoofed. Wardrobe, some superpowers, some character development, camera angles and general scene perspective, CGI, the pace of the action, excessive similarity of quite a few scenes (!?), fight-scenes and concepts, self-cloning characters, and even a non-neutral hue throughout most of the movie which gets situationally changed (as in The Trilogy and its greenish hue).So, this movie isn't really a collection of clich√©s as some reviewers have said. It's one single giant Matrix-spoof-turned-part-of-a-franchise thing. Really, no one has ever copied it so boldly (or with such a straight face) before. Too bad that being uncreative and sleazily plagiarizing does not a good movie make.",3,2,5,16 November 2010
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Some flaws, but overall my favorite film in 2016
","Twelve days after the premiere, and everyone and their mothers has written a review, so I'll keep this one short and only address what I think should be mentioned.Firstly, this is as close to an action film anything in the franchise has ever been, so you have to keep in mind that once the characters have been properly introduced, they'll either kill or be killed, and it won't stop once it starts.Secondly, and this was a major annoyance, the MUSIC was butchered for the first third of the film. There were interesting variations on the themes and some competent rearranging of the known themes, as a pointer to this film being somewhat a separate story to the true trilogy, however, in one of those moments a snippet of the Imperial March is played inside of one of the rearranged themes, just as a Rebel ship flies off into space. THIS IS A NO GO, it was the most confusing moment in the movie, and had me wondering if someone was switching sides or if I'd gotten the characters wrong. Childish mistake on a series of films built on leitmotifs.Thirdly, once you get past the bloopers with the soundtrack (which returns to Williams' themes for the last third of the film) and this or that detail that has been failed to be properly considered, the movie wraps up towards a final act of incredible proportions. There's a mind-blowing crescendo towards the end, to a measure very seldom seen in modern productions. Vader's end scenes reach a high note, just as you see the story unfolding towards our known plot points, and delivers the final blow in a way that makes it hard for fans to hold back a tear here and there. The editing and directing here is a masterpiece, very faithful to Episodes V and VI.Completely worth the watch, and I'd watch the whole trilogy, plus this and The Force Awakens again, anytime. Episodes 1-2-3 are BS, these last two were on point.Oh yeah, and memberberries. They taste oh so great.",9,1,9,27 December 2016
World War Z," Quite a ride
","All in all, it was a very enjoyable cinematic experience. Very fast pace, lots of scares and tense moments, and besides everything I noticed that the movie managed to keep a hold of the whole audience until the end where I watched. There were a couple moments where hysterical laughter and collective sighs were heard throughout...Now as far as doing justice to the book, it veers off pretty quickly, the main difference being that in the book you get several different viewpoints that end up forming a bigger picture. I had no expectations going in as soon as I read online (about a year ago) that 'the zombies were running, they were the fast kind'. Every fan of the genre knows that it's unusual for something positive to follow this last two sentences, so I was expecting something more along the lines of '28 Days' instead of 'The Dead' series (which does no justice at all to the book).I can understand people getting angry about this as someone who appreciated the book, that this was actually a waste of an excellent book in its translation to the cinematic format, but since I had no expectations to begin with, the 'running zombies' ended up adding to the overall pace of the action, and with the best 3d rendition I've ever seen in a movie, it ended up feeling more like an amusement park ride than an actual movie experience. The only major critique is the way it ended, it left me with the impression that the production topped out of their budget before they noticed they had to end it...All in all, totally worth a watch. The 3d is natural and gorgeous, and makes the whole experience very involving. Coupled with the pace, it was FUN.",7,1,4,4 July 2013
The Matrix," Complete...
","The most complete and involving trilogy as far as the possibilities of the medium. Greatest story ever told in an exclusively cinematic format, it's obvious that all the possibilities of the format have been stretched by it. From the dreamy atmosphere to conceptual fight scenes, flawless cruising between parallel realities etc. All leading to an epic, climatic finish that sums up and closes every emotional note raised throughout the series perfectly.Also, to me what was the most stunning aspect of it, was that the freedom in deciding where to take and how to tell the story felt absolute. There was no meddling with it by executive producers or studio executives etc. A piece of movie art, this is where it all leads to.You can have stories as good as this. But you cannot have better movies.",10,0,1,25 May 2009
