Sucker Punch," Snyder great at interpreting already great content, poor at writing his own
","While Snyder may have been great at interpreting already great content (most recently 3 acclaimed graphic novels) into films, he seems to have done a poor job at writing his own. Much of the camera work from his last three films was taken shot for shot from the panels of said graphic novels. Not to diminish his skill when it comes to visuals, because Sucker Punch does have that, at least.That said, I am the target demographic for this film. I'm into almost every fantasy element portrayed in this film, but it just didn't work. The story was bad. Very bad. And Scott Glenn's dialog was cringe worthy.And one thing about the film I can't figure out, why did they apparently shoot elaborate nightclub scenes with choreography, costumes, etc., and then only show them in passing during the credits?! The film would have been much richer for it (though it still wouldn't have saved the story).I'm bummed I paid to see it in IMAX, and honestly, I'd struggle to even watch it on Netflix knowing what I know now. Skip it!",3,3,10,29 March 2011
