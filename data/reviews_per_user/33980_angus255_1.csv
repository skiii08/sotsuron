Skyfall," Head of MI6 hidden in an old house with 2 shotguns and a box of dynamite.
","I really did not like the idea of ending this movie. It was really stupid from 007 to take the head of MI6 to forsaken house with 2 shotguns and a box of dynamite somewhere in Scotland hoping this is the right place to protect M. I was also sad with M death because of long 17 years as M. But OK, if the death had to come it might be in some other way. I know that a lot of the Bond movies are unrealistic but even it seem to be realistic. Terrorists with these kind of ammunition can find out really fast where M is hiding even without GPS in an old Aston Martin. If M died on the heart attack somewhere in unknown MI6 shelter surrounded by 100 agents or something it will be more believable story than we could see in the film. So I was leaving cinema a little bit disappointed because makers let 007 made such a silly and unrealistic escape from London. Despite this ending I really enjoy this movie as a big James Bond fan. :)",8,5,12,31 October 2012
