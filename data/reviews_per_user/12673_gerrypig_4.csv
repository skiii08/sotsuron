Match Point," Slow so slow and very, very boring!
","It seems like (reading the other reviews) if your name is Woody Allen you could get away with everything!Quick summary: Nothing happens the first hour.. Just a bunch of people talking about nothing, watching opera and attending to galleries.. The movie starts to build up a little bit when this mistress gets pregnant and desperate to get Chris to leave his wife. The rest is just stupid!I mean: The cop had the complete solution of the crime coming to him before he fell a sleep: EUREKA!! Clever cop! (Chris killing the old lady and the mistress). Sorry Mac.. Chris stole a wedding ring from the old lady and fails to throw it in the river so it falls back on the ground.. An drug addicts finds it, attends to a shoot out and gets killed in the same neighborhood the old lady got killed in. The smart cop gets confronted with this. Case closed. Chris is off the hook!! Likely? NO!! .. If it was just that the plot sucked major I might not bother to write this review but there is more:The most of the characters are just so incredible uninteresting! I must admit that Scharlett Johansson did a nice performance.. But the rest of them...OH GOD HOW BORING!The only person I got some emotions towards was Chloe. I was thinking during the movie: Hey man why don't you kill your nagging wife instead!! Chris?? Chriiiis? Where are you ?? Chriiiiiiiiss?? Whats that in your pocket?? Pills? What kind of pills?? Chriiiiss?? Are you taking a dump?? Chriiis? I guess that might be some relevance to the morale of the movie (read metaphor :)). But I Don't Care! It sucks!! Specially the main character! He is so boring that you might want to take his tennis racket and smack him hard in his face! He uses 5 seconds to respond to the simplest questions and his answers isn't to bright either.. There is probably hundreds of stupid metaphors in the flick, so you hopefully will give the film a thought after its finished. The metaphors gets pushed in your face like a baby being fed with a spoon!If you like this movie you probably also would like to watch 'Gone with the wind ' three times in a row :)",2,5,9,17 June 2006
Insidious," Horror for kids
","I must admit I had high expectations for this film but it turned out to be wasted energy. Evil spirit dressed like a mafia bully and fighting like one as well, old woman with Toys r us wig and a demon with red face paint and cheap contact lenses doesn't do it for me.. sorry..-Quote IMDb:'Writer Leigh Whannell stated at the Toronto Film Festival that when he wrote the film he had a list of horror movie clichés posted above him, so he could avoid using them'. Well.. The movie is packed with clichés!! Records changing tunes, children laughing, old woman laughing, old medium chick, child drawings of nightmares, shadow of spirit (mafia bully) in the window, fog machines, etc etc etc... YAWN!",2,1,4,25 November 2011
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Master Lucas
","I loved this last part.. As the two last movies thrashed the joy of star wars, this one brought it right up again..It has the same vibe as the old ones... And it reveals most of my questions in a perfect way.. I even love the theatrical acting.. Its just like the good old days..! Today is the first day I really feel old. I realized I've been waiting 20 years for this movie.. As the movie ended, so ended much of my childhood as well..What a perfect ending! Thanks Master Lucas! Ehh.. Does anyone have any star wars toys for sale ? --- Gerry 30y old",10,1,5,19 May 2005
