","Well, this is probably the best movie released in 2019. Such a great story, such a great cast and last but not least great cars! Loved every minute at the cinema. Totally worth your money and time. Recommend this to your friends and family and they will be grateful for that.",10,6,11,13 December 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Not bad, not good too
","I was waiting this movie since I saw The Hateful Eight at home and said to me that on the next Tarantino movie I will surely go to the cinema. To be honest I through this will gonna be an epic movie (like all other Tarantino moves are) with epic cast but unfortunately this is not the case. At some point I got bored about the actors and was not living the moment with them, but the end scene was so great I forgot about the boring beginning.
Overall is a good movie, but I know (and we all know) Tarantino could do much better.
As from my point of view the story our beloved producer took as a raw version for his movie is not interesting, or at leas it was not showed in a interesting way in the final movie.
Last, but not least, I advise you to go watch this movie in theaters, but if you are out of money right now you can wait till the DVD release as you will not miss that much. I am very sad to say this about a movie from one of my favorites producers.P.S. Why Tarantino included the Sharon and Polanski story in the movie if their characters does affect the story in any way? Or I am not getting something?",9,5,8,21 August 2019
