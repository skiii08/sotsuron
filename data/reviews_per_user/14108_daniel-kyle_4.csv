Miracle," Best Coaching Movie Ever Made
","I caught this movie on TV last week, having missed it in theaters a few years ago - not being very interested in 'hockey' movies. As I started to watch it, I could tell within 10 minutes that it was going to be terrific, mostly due to the excellent performance of Kurt Russell. Why he was not nominated for an Oscar is beyond me, because his character is the Hannibal Lecter of sports coaches. The whole movie is really about coaching and team building, perhaps the best example since '12 O'Clock High', and doesn't bore the non-hockey enthusiast with endless games, much like 'Rocky' and boxing, instead focusing on character. Being Canadian (where the movie was filmed, by the way), I was also happy not to have over-the-top patriotic rhetoric. Though there are 'goofs' on historical accuracy, it is always enjoyable to see a period of history replayed. An excellent film, and a must see for anyone of any age and level of sports interest.",10,1,1,17 February 2008
The Day After Tomorrow," Not Plausible, But Not Bad Either!
","I am surprised by the first wave of comments and reviews for this movie being mostly negative. As a pre-Summer blockbuster it is actually quite good, with excellent special effects and a story no worse than any from this genre. The closest I can compare it to would be 'Deep Impact', but with the 'money shots' all through the movie rather than just at the end. The acting from all the main players is decent as well, with none portraying an overdone cliché to an extreme. Being from Canada, a signer of the Kyoto Accord, it is my belief that the detractors of this film are mostly against its warning of global warming, and that in the US those that back the more Republican views are also the most likely to see this movie as trash. I don't really believe the plausibility either, but then I decided to just view it as another disaster movie since the 'message' wasn't really shoved down the viewers throats anyway. The fact remains that humans didn't cause the last Ice Age to happen 10,000 years ago, nor are we responsible for other events such as pole shifts and the potential loss of Earth's magnetic field. However, studies have shown that Ozone layer depletion AND global warming effects are likely caused by our activities, so a gentle push to correct our ways before it's too late is a good idea - clean air to breathe IS better after all. And with gas prices at the pump soaring, who doesn't want to either conserve or find alternate fuels anyway? Only those who are in bed with the oil companies (i.e. G.W. Bush and Co.), but I doubt that the Democrats would do much better - they haven't yet when they've had the chance, except Carter creating ANWR, and even he fished regularly with Saudi princes..",8,0,0,29 May 2004
I Am Legend," Wow! A book-movie!
","I am glad to see that the initial voting gives this a high rating (anything on IMDb above a 7 is usually worth watching), but I'll be surprised if this does big long-term Box Office. Expect a resurgence on DVD, however, since this is great weekend afternoon fare (I watched it at a Saturday matinée, which, by the way, was 90% empty. This reminded me (no spoilers here) of one of my favorite sci-fi epics, 'The Postman' (with Kevin Costner, 1998), also based on science fiction literature from 40 years ago. These movies have the hold-over paranoia that grew out of the 1920-50's. I actually liked Postman better for the story, since anyone who has seen Heston's version of this, 'Omega Man', will remember a two-line plot. But Will Smith adds so much heart to his character, sort of Tom Hanks in 'Cast Away', that the movie goes by almost too quickly. I will definitely watch it again on DVD, and unlike Postman which requires more pre-planning due to its bookish plotting, this has a good balance of action and reflection. I've given it a 9, but please prove me wrong and let it be a hit.",9,3,6,15 December 2007
Man on Fire," Denzel does 'Death Wish VI'
","This movie has (the late) Charles Bronson written all over it, from producer Lance Hool (who did many of Bronson's early 80's films) to the character's name: Creasy (you mean Kersey?). A shame that Old Leather Face is no longer around, too, since this would have been one of his best films, a great send off to be run at retrospective film festivals for years to come. For Denzel, however, this is absolute slumming as an actor. He passed this stage over 20 years ago as a bit player on 'St. Elsewhere', and for some reason of late has decided to take every 'Man On The Edge' role that comes along. In a movie like 'The Hurricane' it works. Here, overrun by Tony Scott's 'NYPD Blue on Fast Forward' direction, it doesn't. Obviously, 2 time Academy Award winner Washington needed something after his performance in 'Training Day' to prove he had more to give us, but I couldn't help thinking of Buzz Aldrin after the first Moon landing - how his life had peaked in achievement and depression set in. Well, unless Denzel goes back to playing varied characters, a career depression will soon set in, because I haven't seen him break out of the Edgy Man persona since 'Philadelphia', though I did happen to like 'John Q.', even if few else saw it. I love Denzel, one of the best actors in a long time, but he is typecasting himself for no reason when he has the power to take any role he wants.",Null,0,0,15 September 2004
