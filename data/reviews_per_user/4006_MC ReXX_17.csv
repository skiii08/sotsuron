Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What's so wrong about this movie?
","Straight to the point, I watched it and I like it. Isn't that the point? It certainly wasn't Star Wars (Episode 4), but it was certainly not a 'Red Planet'.Given that the story felt childish and predictable but this movie still kept my attention.The pod race and the final battle sequences were amazing, the sound was awesome and so were the special effects.On to Episode 2. For anyone who's always wanted to see Star Wars and never got around to it, best thing is to start with Star Wars (Episode 4) and then go back to Episode 1 so you don't get disappointed with Episode 1 and not watch the rest of the series. 8/10",6,1,2,18 January 2003
Insomnia," It's worth the price of admission
","I have to admit right off the bat, that I expected this movie to be given at least an 8.5/10 - 10/10 with 3 top brand actors (Pacnio, Williams & Swank) and a very good director in Nolan after seeing Memento (which was great).After watching Insomnia though, it's proven a point that I should always listen to. 'Just because there are top name actors or directors or producers, doesn't mean the film is gonna be amazing.' And that's exactly what happened here. BUT, (if I paid) it was worth the price of admission (got free passes).The film is set in Alaska, in a small fishing town where everybody knows everbody. A murder of a 17-year old girl is committed and a top LA detective is called in (Pacino) to solve the murder. But the plot takes in interesting twist and the movie takes off there.The pros of this movie: The script was well written and smart. It's not a 'leave your brain at the door movie.' The cinematography is excellent. The direction is very similar to Memento, with very quick flash backs use while a conversation is happening. The acting was fairly good. Pacino, playing the (we've seen it before) don't give a crap detective/cop. Williams, playing a very well, mind-screwing detective author. Swank, who's role was small, but still made the best of it.The Cons of this movie: Williams has a TON of skill and ability as a non-comedic actor, and he doesn't receive enough screen time in my opinion to really shine. If the roles of Williams and Pacino were switched, maybe things could have been a little more interesting. If not, at least the interaction between Pacino and Williams should have been extended or have been able to meet several more times. Where in this movie they only been 2 or 3 times. If the interaction between them where increased, we could have seen acting ability at it's best.Overall, again it would be worth the price of admission. If you liked Memento or Don't Say A Word, you'll like Insomnia.Final Rating: 7.5/10",8,0,0,22 May 2002
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Absolutely awesome movie! But...
","Just came back from seeing Terminator 3 and I must say, this movie was fantastic. Great action, great story, great intensity, great acting and great ending. This movie is a must see and definitely worth the price of admission (or even if you're over charged). It definitely felt like a different Terminator movie. Overall very well done.BUT. It was not as good as Terminator 2. The movie lacked a few things to make me say it was one of the best movies ever (as T2 is my favorite movie of all time). The biggest item it was missing was the depth of Terminator 1 and 2. It was missing a soul. The movie seemed REALLY fast, the first 30 minutes were paced very well and then it was sent into overdrive from there. Arnold's character of the T-101 was good, but come on, way too many funny lines and he's not as ruthless as he should be!  My biggest complaint though is the music. PLEASE BRING BACK BRAD FIEDEL, I BEG YOU! Marco Beltrami's score, FLAT OUT SUCKED or WAS NON-EXISTENT! Who hired this goof?! The movie could have been EVEN BETTER if the score was good!Mostow, you did a good job, but seriously you have to pace a movie a little better instead of one big rush like most of your movies are.The car/crane chase was absolutely amazing... WOW. Bathroom fight was nuts. But I have to say the graveyard shoot out was WAY TOO SHORT.Yes, it does seem like there are more cons then pros, but trust me, this is a great film and definitely worth the watch. If there is a Terminator 4, I can't wait for it.Final Rating: 9/10Again, PLEASE BRING BACK BRAD FIEDEL, I'M BEGGING YOU! I'M ON MY KNEES HERE!",7,0,0,2 July 2003
U-571," Very Entertaining
","I initially saw this movie to see what Jonathan Mostow could do with a big budget movie, since he is directing Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines.After watching Breakdown I knew he could capture the audience members in suspense. And after watching U-571, I know he can do action sequences very well.One thing that seemed to be flawed though, was the pacing of the movie. Certain parts seemed to drag, certain parts seemed rush and overall, it felt like, I knew 2 hours have pasted, but in the movie made me feel like everything took place in 30 minutes.Overall, throughly entertaining and now have no doubt, Mostow has the talent to make a very entertaining movie, but can he capture the emotion, pace and heart of The Terminator series? On July 2, 2003 we will find out if Mostow will pass the ultimate test of his career.8/10",8,0,2,18 January 2003
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The Greatest Movie of All Time
","This movie has it all. A great story, great acting, great directing, great dialogue, great action, great suspense... everything I could ever want in a movie. I have watched this movie countless times, and each time it seems to just get better and better for me.James Cameron's higher-budgeted action/adventure, is a work of art. This series is his baby and he treated it like one, with great care and vision to make sure it matured well in later parts of the movie.Arnold Schwarzenegger shows why he is the man to destroy box office records with memorable characters such as The Terminator (Series 800 Model 101).With a strong supporting cast as well by Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong by his side, the chemistry between all these characters was like a well oiled machine (no pun intended).To top it off, one of the scariest villains of all time is in this movie, Robert Patrick's T-1000. The near emotionless face of his actions is always a site to behold as his mission is always focused on one thing and one thing only. To kill John Conner.The final aspect of this film which makes it so great is one of the most memorable scores in movie history composed by Brad Fiedel. The strength of the sound of the Terminator, the deep and scary theme of the T-1000 and of course, the opening theme itself. The score, is this movies soul and it definitely shows in this movie.Although Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines was good, it lacked the soul and feel of Terminator 2: Judgment Day.The greatest movie of all time.Final Rating: 10/10",10,1,1,5 July 2003
Van Helsing," The OD of CG soured my taste for this movie
","Don't get me wrong, I'm all for CGI but not when it completely dominates the movie. Van Helsing utilized it way too much, from the buildings, to the characters, to the stunts, the environment, etc. It looked as though 90% of the movie was done completely on a computer. If you're going to use CG use it when you really have to, if it costs way too much to do the real deal or the model costs too much or you can make the image look very realistic (I know, it can't be perfect, but damn close to it is possible these days). LXG had this problem as well and it seems like the makers of Van Helsing didn't learn from LXG's mistakes.The story, acting, cinematography were pretty good. Not amazing, but pretty good. Directing seemed kind of rushed to me as though Stephen Sommers just wanted to get to the next CGI scene or action scene.The Mummy was an awesome movie. Absolutely fantastic and used CG when they had to, but a lot of camera, makeup and other tricks were used to bring out the world of early-20th century Egypt. Van Helsing didn't, and that was its downfall.Final Rating: 7/10",7,0,0,9 May 2004
District 9," Good but some stuff was just...
","There are things I liked and disliked about this movie. What I liked was the action (love the kills) and original story with themes from human history, apartheid, segregation and suppression of a race being some of them.What I disliked is this sudden fixation by film makers to use documentary style handicam movie making that's suddenly become the norm to make it feel more 'real'. It seems like every movie is done by Paul Greengrass. I'm really getting sick of it to be honest.The villains were really unbelievable, I mean come on, the government and military heads suddenly think like Nazi's and don't have an ounce of human compassion? Their dialogue was cringe worthy.It's an overall good watch, but didn't live up to the hype for me.",7,0,3,14 November 2009
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," What the HELL was THAT?!
","I'm usually a positive reviewer. Given a movie the benefit of the doubt usually. But my goodness, Jurrasic Park 2 is awful, story wise. Special effects, acting and suspense was good. But story seemed to be written by a 3 year old who did it for 'Creative Writing' class.If you're a fan of the first JP, get ready to be dissapointed. If you've never seen it, DON'T! Just skip to the 3rd one which is much much better this this pile of T-Rex dung.5/10 (and that's being generous)",5,0,1,13 February 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," What more can be said?
","If I give a full review, I'd just be repeating what everyone else said, so I'll make it quick.Great movie.Great story.Amazing effects.Kept me on the edge.Can't wait for the last one.10/10.GO SEE THIS MOVIE! IT'S THAT DAMN GOOD!
Thank you. :)",10,0,0,20 December 2002
The Hurt Locker," Fantastic contemporary war story
","A very raw look at the bomb disposal squad operating in Iraq. This movie puts you on the edge of your seat every time the bomb squad is sent in to disarm a bomb, you just don't know what the outcome will be. The other action scenes are fantastic, very genuine in my opinion.The acting is strong with Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie sharing some very strong scenes together.The flow of the movie is excellent thanks to good editing and Kathryn Bigelow set the war in Iraq perfectly as not a complete hellish war zone and not a walk in the park either, more like a 'watch your back at all times no matter what you're doing' situation.Bottom line, this is a VERY STRONG contender for best picture and best director.",8,2,6,21 February 2010
K-19: The Widowmaker," Ford was playing a Russian? Could have fooled me.
","Dear god the accents were bad in this movie. I have never seen such bad Russian accents in any other movie. Hell, Arnold Schwarzenegger did a better job in Red Heat! I could hear right through the accents and pick up the 'American' in them. LOLOther then that element, I'm at a lose on why this movie flopped at the box office? It's a very solid movie. Better than U-571, although it focused more on the action of the movie. Director Kathryn Bigelow shows that she is a very skilled director who is able to capture the suspense and emotion very well.Definitely a good movie to see, 8.5/10.",8,2,4,24 January 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A cinematic masterpiece... but...
","A very shallow story compared to Tarantino standards. Although it could be possible that the story really picks up in Volume 2, so far from what I saw, the story is what it is with no twists (expect at one point), turns or serious story development, '4 assassins were sent by Bill to kill 'The Bride' and now she wants revenge.'However, that aside, this movie is one of the best movies of 2003 so far. The directing is superb (as always by Tarantino), the cinematography is jaw-dropping, the same can be said for the stunts and visual effects, the score is fantastic and the acting is top notch.A note about the stunts and visual effects. Since very minimal CGI was used (and I mean minimal), it made the movie even better. Directors and producers should take a page out of this movie and cut down on the use of visual effects, because it can seriously kill the appeal of a movie such as The Matrix: Reloaded did. If you go back to movies in the early 90's when CGI was just coming of age, it made those movies appealing and even better then present day CGI overloaded movies because it was amazing to see what was done without the use of CGI, and you start thinking 'how did they do that?' Examples; Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Total Recall, Batman, Back To The Future: Part 2, etc.If you're a definite fan of the genre of old Hong Kong and Japanese action movies, go see this ASAP. If you love sword fights, watch this now. If you're a Tarantino fan, what the heck are you waiting for? If you want to watch something different for once in the action movie genre, this is it.Final Rating: 9/10Oh BTW, this movie DEFINITELY deserves it's 'R' rating!",9,0,1,11 October 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Felt like a Star Wars Prequel.
","The effects and fight scenes were great, no doubt, I don't need to get into that any further. It's what makes me give the movie my final rating.My complaints are:1) The dialogue, it's as though when this script was written the Bros. kept refering to a thesaurus just to make it sound 'intelligent' when it doesn't have to (like the first one). I got the movie fine, but I was not impressed by the delivery.2) There was also a slight overkill with the action, the first had a perfect blend of story and action.3) Should have been more screen time for the virus twins.4) The weapons suck in Reloaded compared to the first one.It was good movie, but not great like I expected. It's worth the price of admission. I don't know if I want to 'reload' this into my DVD collection though... will have to wait and see what Revolutions offers.Final Rating: 8/10",9,0,0,15 May 2003
Die Hard," One of the greatest action movies, of all time.
","My personal favorite action movie of all time, as well as favorite movie of all time is, Terminator 2: Judgment Day. This however, ranks right up there with the greats.What's great about this movie is that it's not just another shoot-em-up, load it with pyro action movie... ok well it is, BUT, it's a very SMART shoot-em-up, load it with pyro action movie. As you watch this movie you definitely feel McClane frustration and pain. It shows that Bruce Willis is not a dumb-ass when it comes to portraying a character very well.This movie also proves why John McTiernan is one of the best action movie directors in Hollywood (other than Rollerball of coarse). I heard there's gonna be a Die Hard 4... now THAT is something I'm definitely looking forward to.Final Rating: 10/10",9,1,2,25 January 2003
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Right up there with the first one!
","What a ride this movie was. This movie takes no time getting to the point. The action picks up right from the first 2 minutes of the movie and it just doesn't stop until the movie is over.The combo of Willis & Jackson was a beautiful one. They played off each other very well and left some very memorable quotes in the process. Jeremy Iron did a damn good job as they villain of the movie.This movie was just as intense, funny and exciting as the first one. A must see for any action fan. See this movie at once if you haven't yet!10/10",10,1,2,12 February 2003
Speed," A great action thriller!
","This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the first time I saw it and I still like this movie just as much today. This is an action thriller that definitely comes out big with the pay off. If you're an action fan PERIOD, watch this movie.The only complaint I have, is the acting. Other than Hopper, Bullock, Morton, Daniels and (yes I'll let him slide) Reeves, the acting was beyond dismal. I'm talking mainly about the hostages. My god, who casted these cardboard cutouts? Especially the guy who says, 'Yeah, a bomb, some joke' or something like that... my god if I was the director, I would slap the sh*t out of the guy until he got it right or fire his ass and rather cast MYSELF!Other then that minor detail... 9/10.",9,0,1,22 January 2003
Up in the Air," Clooney and Kendrick are awesome but what's up with that final act?
","While I don't believe this movie should win best picture at this years Oscars (and neither should Avatar), I have to say this was a very well done movie.George Clooney is brilliant in his performance. While some say he's that 'cool guy' in every movie, he seems to be able to mold a character on to his personality very well.Supporting actress Anna Kendrick shines bright in this movie, she does an amazing job in her role as Ryan's sidekick. This girl is gonna go places.Jason Reitman does a fine job with his directing, it was fluid and clear between scenes.My only gripe is the final act, it suddenly became a 'romantic comedy' ending and while it was done well, I was expecting a somewhat different outcome or a different way in handling the ending.",9,0,2,25 February 2010
