Skyfall," Drama styled Bond introducing series to youngsters
","-minor spoiler-I'm not the greatest Bond fun you can find but I have watched several films of the series so I think I can at least compare this one with some of them. It's not a bad film actually, there is a lot of breathtaking action scenes in various locations all over the world, nice looking women and a kind of plot that can stick you to the couch for as long as the movie lasts. But, it's not the kind of film you could watch again (like Casino Royal) because there is really nothing original in it. There are multiple problems.. The story reminds me of some films in the beginning of the Internet era where everything was somehow explained by the hacking abilities of some ultra-specialized guys who could do almost anything by coding and infringing into networks. In 2013 this is not an original concept as reality seems a lot more complicated than that (and therefore more interesting). I think, this is an effort of the producers to come out with a totally new series of Bond based on the way the world is today. That means good-buy electronic gadgets (everyone can have one), macho attitude (it's totally out of trend), extreme resistance to pain (no on bites for this any more) and hello to networked world, frankly attitude, and more realistic see-through character placement. It's a 'brave new world' as Bond says after meeting next-gen Q in a museum... Don't be over-thrilled by the reviews, it's neither a bad nor a good film, probably it's the kind of average film, nice for a rainy evening with pizzas and colas, nothing more than that. Mendes really tried to make a film with vivid characters as he has done in his previous works although the ones in Bond series were always contradictory and actually confusing so it's like trying to solve a knotty that is tied up for 50 years. At least he didn't mess it all up. Maybe this film could be called 'Adapt Or Die'. At the end, Bond comes alive through this and if he gets himself a nice treatment from a psycho-analyst he may come back even stronger. In any other case the audience will probably find more amazing heroes to lean on.",5,2,6,17 February 2013
Prometheus," It's this damn dejavu again
","I was amazed when I first heard about this project. After watching some trailers I was looking forward for the movie to be released. When this happened, I grabbed a ticket and went for the show.The beginning of the movie is very well made and creates huge expectations for what is coming. There is a very authentic atmosphere in the film mostly because of the collaboration with this visual artist HR Giger whose creations is all around. Those who have seen work of Giger will identify certain characters and his unearthly persistence with the symbols of sex, mutation and decomposition. The colors of the film are mostly restricted in to Giger's palette.The problem with this movie is the script, especially the part with the dialogs. We have watched tens of team-movies were the members are killed one by one - someone would expect some kind of evolution. There is nothing original here. The characters are not convincing, maybe because they've been given some kind of attitude and the direction sticks to it canceling any other detail that could make them look more real. There are also some very un-scientific and irrational behaviors that can not be justified and are not clearly explained, so they looks kind of weird. For professionals, they all look amateurs and some of them idiot. The script is not helping since the action is performed in the most expected way. Apart from the mechanical export of an alien from the body of a person, there is really nothing original here again. The approach of characters remains in the surface and even the most 'touching' scenes are looking indifferent. Some scary scenes look like they were made only as an obligation to the hardcore audience and don't add much to the film. Well of course this could be the beginning for a series of movies but I would prefer one that could stand by it's own, like previous works of R. Scott. I believe most of director's fans won't miss this movie. They'll wish they had. Everyone will enjoy Giger's art, CGI and those husky human- like aliens who look like copied from Duran Duran video 'Wild Boys'. Some 6 stars will be enough.",6,2,4,30 June 2012
