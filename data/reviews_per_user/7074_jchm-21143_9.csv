Ford v Ferrari," Beautiful
","Visually stylish, gorgeously filmed and with a fantastic soundtrack.
I really am not a big fan of motor racing but this kept me enthralled from beginning to end.
The real life events have been manipulated somewhat for entertainments sake but the result is so good that hardly matters.
Best film I've seen for years",9,2,2,26 April 2020
First Man," Very very disappointing
","I've waited a long time for an Armstrong biopic. Unfortunately it turned out not not to be worth it.
Plodding storyline, incomprehensible events and appalling direction.
I've got a pretty good knowledge of the 60s space programme but anybody who doesn't will be lost right from the beginning of this film. No explanation, establishing shots or narrative to give any sort of context to what is going on in key events.
Also, although the exploration of Armstrong's relationship with his wife was fairly interesting, the depiction of the same with his fellow astronauts and Aldrin in particular was a major lost opportunity. After the movie, I felt no wiser at all than I did before in this respect.
But the major failing of this movie is the awful vertigo inducing camerawork. Pivotal action sequences and events are told through blurred out of focus shots of extreme close ups. The shaky handheld camerawork just left me feeling ill. I really don't know what on earth would drive any competant director to depict huge space vehicles being launched on towers of flame by holding an out of focus camera 2 inches away from someone's nostrils for 5 minutes.
I had hoped that 'First Man,' would sit within the pantheon of such movies as 'The Right Stuff,' and 'Apollo 13.' No such luck. What a waste.",3,10,17,30 November 2018
The Monuments Men," Pretty Lame really
","Moderately entertaining if somewhat unbelievable.
It's a bit hard to take seriously someone as grossly obese as John Goodman in fatigues. There's no way anyone could have got to that size on wartime rations let alone manage an assault course.
Clooney has said the film is about '80% accurate.' Personally I find that a little generous given that the climax of the movie is ripped off a real life event completely unrelated to this story. It is actually a retelling of the US's mission to beat the Soviets to Werner Von Braun and his missile research and nothing to do with saving works of art.
But from the rest of the unengaging storyline I'm guessing there wasn't actually enough excitement in the true events to warrant an interesting screenplay.
In summary, it passes a couple of hours if you are bored. Band of Brothers - it ain't.",5,1,1,10 May 2020
Aquaman," Not quite rubbish.... but close
","Looks more like a video game than a movie.
CGI Overkill;
Zero character build up;
Corny script;
Almost non-existent storyline. What there is appears to have been written by a twelve year old.Major disappointment and frankly just plain boring...",3,1,3,12 April 2019
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," Quite a ridiculous film
","Not the storyline. That seems quite acceptable if unremarkable.
But the production design.
This seems to be wholly aimed people with no knowledge of the time period or location in which the film is set. It gives an overwhelming impression of being aimed solely at American tourists.
I suppose the very fact that four of the cast appeared in 'Downton Abbey,' (that wet dream fantasy of Daily Telegraph readers) should have rung alarm bells to start with. Just like that TV show, it presents a completely inaccurate and unbelievable picture.
Black American soldiers dancing with white girls in 1946? Come on...
And what would a Black GI be doing in London in '46 anyway?
Then there's the Male lead - who probably would have been run out of town in the rural post-war UK. Hair over his collar, designer stubble - and a wedding band?!?!!. No sorry - nobody looked like that then.
But the most laughable issue is the location. Guernsey looks absolutely nothing like the north coast of Devon where this was filmed. I'm sure it's much prettier and meets the criteria demanded to appeal to a certain 'Gee... ain't that quaint?' type of audience. But to anyone with the slightest knowledge of reality, it comes over as absurd.
So all in all, as a film it's little more than stereotyped wallpaper. Read the book instead. I imagine it's a little more honest",3,7,14,22 November 2018
"Hail, Caesar!"," What is the point of this movie???
","Polished, technically competent and nicely shot.
However - utterly devoid of of any meaningful story. The five or six amusing jokes throughout the length of the film were nowhere near enough to rescue this from being just downright boring. It is merely a collection of dead end sub-plots which do not ever really mesh into a whole. Visually slick but without depth, 'Hail Caesar,' confirmed to me that the Cohn Bros are one of cinemas most overrated concerns.",3,1,3,16 June 2019
Black Panther," A worthy political point doesn't mean a movie isn't going to be mediocre
","And thats what this film is.Yes its great that the main actors are black (although as its set in central Africa what else would they be???).
But in reality it s a very average film. There is nothing particularly oustanding about the movie. The set design is very good (in particular the 'techno-organic' archirecture of Wakanda.) But the storyline is very average - and even sub-standard in places.
The battle scenes in particular are somewhat absurd and unbelieveable - looking more like a mass brawl than any military operation. I suspect whoever wrote it knows very little about armed conflict or military history.
Also the the villains are very disappointing. Klaw is probably the best bad guy the MCU has come up with. However, he is dispensed with early on to make way fort just another baddie clone of the hero. Same as happened in Ant-Man, Thor, Winter Soldier, Iron Man... in fact just about every other Marvel film. A major opportunity lost.
Anyway... it's okay - just. But just that and nothing more.",4,2,5,17 June 2019
The Greatest Showman," Awful
","Zero plot
Zero character build up
Unrealistic representations of actual people.
Lots of self-indulgent 'me me me,' whining.
The music is horrible - like being trapped in a lift with a boy band for two hours.
The best bit is where the bearded lady nearly knocks herself out with her own boobs when she starts dancing.
Horrible and boring",2,4,7,29 January 2019
Gladiator," Worst pile of crap ever filmed
","Appalling continuity.
Woeful direction.
Absurdly ignorant of actual history.The cinematic equivalent of Henry VIII defeating the Luftwaffe by inventing the electric guitar. The way to like this movie is to have no understanding of history and even less of film making.Indefensible tosh for gullible idiots",1,3,16,17 June 2019
