Antz," Yes, for kids.
","You know, there was a time in which we didn't candy coat stories for children. The Evil Queen in Snow White, for one, was forced to wear red-hot slippers and dance to her death. Even in older Disney films like 'Bambi', the serious issue of death is broached.Now, no one dies. It's too serious.Horsehocky.One of the best moments I had watching 'Antz' in a theater was listening to a mother explain why Barbatus died. Guess what? Death is a natural part of life -- and to refute it exists is plain wrong. Or, as in the recent Disney flick 'Hercules', Hades, the God of Death is portrayed as evil. (What, are people supposed to be immortal?)While not appropriate for 4 year olds, I wouldn't think twice about showing it to an 8 year old. Why must movies be dumbed down -- PG means parental GUIDANCE. Any movie that forces you to talk to your kids after a movie is a good one. Don't treat your kids like little morons.",10,32,46,14 January 2001
Citizen Kane," What more is there to say?
","I won't reiterate what has been already said about the film by countless film critics and movie scholars. As a critic and scholar of film myself, I'm well aware of the innovativeness of Toland's work, the masterful acting by the Mercury Theater players, the brashness and subtleness of Welles' direction -- as well as his portrayal of the title character.I think the highest praise I can give the film is that whenever it is on -- whether I'm playing it or it happens to be on TV -- time seems to stop. My eyes and ears belong to the movie. Even though I know every word nearly by heart, the film just DEMANDS my attention. I can't channel flip when this black-and-white masterpiece is showing. I feel like Francois Truffaut did -- the film is something Welles was never able to replicate again; the stars were aligned in film history for possibly the only time ever (though some, like Casablanca, come damned close!)I doubt one word can describe a man's life -- a thousand can't describe one man's film.",10,1,3,8 January 2004
The Terminator," Better than T2
","Re-viewing The Terminator, I'm struck by how much tighter and more emotionally involving this film is to its successor, Terminator 2.T2 feels bloated and too much in love with its technology in comparison with Terminator's passable FX. However, the Biehn/Hamilton romance is powerful.Additionally, the combat scenes are much more intense than T2's. There was no real danger level in T2 -- even though Robert Patrick's T-1000 character is superior to Schwarzenegger's Terminator.Also, Arnold's flat unemotional villian is superior to his flat, unemotional hero. Arnold's better as a villian.The scene in which the Terminator invades the human compound in the future is perhaps the bleakest in cinematic history, complete with off-screen sobbing from a woman, who's crying perhaps embodies the hopelessness of the situation.Cameron has worked better with smaller budgets -- shortening his film and narrowing his focus. In T2 there were many slow moments; Terminator has none.",Null,0,0,9 October 1999
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Stupidest people on Earth
","Forgetting the contrivances and the lines that scream FORESHADOWING!!! (Sure, the girl just HAPPENS to be a gymnast.)But was there ANYONE stupider than that corporate executive WHO GOES INTO THE HOLD OF THE SHIP AFTER THE BABY T-REX?! Never mind there are dead bodies everywhere. Just plain retarded -- and not just the character, the WRITING.",Null,0,0,27 February 2001
Event Horizon," Good Sci-Fi Horror
","People seem to have extreme opinions of this film -- as usual. It's tiring to read 'THIS MOVIE WAS THE BEST EVER!!!!' and 'THIS MOVIE WAS THE WORST EVER!!!' with glib explanations why.'Event Horizon' is an unusual movie, but I like it. Unlike other horror films, this one has a soul, and a theme. The theme is regrets.First off, the characters and actors are first-rate. Laurence Fishbourne and Sam Neill particularly stand out. Fishbourne's character is more subtle than any roles I had seen him in -- save perhaps his 'Boyz N the Hood' Furious Styles character. Sam Neill has the unenviable job of playing a character who goes whacko -- and not only does he have to go completely over-the-top, but he has to do it in an emotionally believeable manner.Neill's character, before his transformation, is very sympathetic. In fact, one can't help but root for him to save himself. Hints of his extreme loneliness are echoed from the first shot of the film -- him inside a lonely sphere within a vast maze, constantly pulling back -- reminscient of the opening shot of 'Star Trek: First Contact'. He battles the demons within of his dead wife (having committed suicide due to her depression and obvious abandonment issues.)There is evil in this movie, and it uses regret and loss to conquer. Neill's character is unable to deal with the pain of the loss of his wife, so evil provides him with an escape.On another level, the movie is a fun terror ride. There is not as much gore as implied in these other posts. The movie's darkness is capably lightened somewhat by Jason Isaac's character.One note: The movie's opening score probably marks the first time a hard-driving dark metal-techno beat was used to open a score -- but it works, in a big way. It's jarring enough in its incongruity for a horror sci-fi film it actually WORKS.",Null,0,0,24 August 1999

Annie Hall," Subtle yet hysterical
","I can't imagine anyone thinking 'Annie hall' is 'dull'. Knowing the 'Star Wars' fanaticism on the web, it's not surprising some science-fiction geeks would have antipathy sight-unseen for it winning Best Picture in 1977 (and I love science fiction -- but I love film even more.)For one, 'Star Wars' was a blockbuster -- and in the 70's, blockbusters, no matter how silly, got nominated. (See 'The Towering Inferno'). Harrison Ford told George Lucas he couldn't write worth crap -- and even 'Star Wars' isn't exactly original -- it's basically a bunch of one-dimensional 'types' of characters. I preferred 'The Empire Strikes Back' because it actually fleshed the characters out (being written by Lawrence Kasdan).
That said, 'Annie Hall' was so original it's been copied endlessly by other filmmakers -- from 'When Harry Met Sally...' to 'Jeffrey'. It's so subtle even fans of the film miss some of its points --For instance, Alvy and Annie are never truly in love. In that famous 'lurve' scene, for instance, Alvy basically twists Annie's arm to get her to say she loves him -- and she convinces herself. Meanwhile, Alvy avoids saying he loves her by using variations of the word ('I luff you, I lurve you...') Once the viewer realizes that, the rest of the movie changes, and you understand parts of the reason that Alvy's never had a truly successful relationship.Even on totally face value, 'Annie Hall' is extremely funny. From the lowbrow jokes -- 'Don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love!' 'I'm with two guys named Cheech!' to the deviously sexy -- 'Twins, Max! 16 years old. Think of the numerical possibilities!' to the clever -- 'They're always giving awards -- Best Fascist Dictation: Adolf Hitler!' 'Do they give out awards for that kind of music? I thought just earplugs.' Who can't laugh at the animation fantasy in which he envisions Annie as the Wicked Queen from Snow White? ('I don't get a period! I'm a cartoon character!')'Annie Hall' is Allen's best work, simply because it is one of the most imitated films ever, and, as we all know -- imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.One note-- even though the film is filled with cynicism and funny scenes, the ending always leaves me a little misty. It's wistful and touching.

Total Recall," Yes, it WAS all just a dream
","There is strong evidence that the entire movie may have been the virtual 'trip' by Doug Quaid. The memory Rekall chooses for Quaid is called 'Blue Sky On Mars', and monitor previewing the memory feature the generators revealed later in the film. How in the world would Rekall know about the generators - it's too strong a coincidence, especially since the movie ends with blue skies on Mars. Moreover, after Quaid advises Melina to kiss him before he wakes up, the movie does a fade to WHITE, which is usually reserved in films for people awakening from a dream. In short, yes, the entire film after Quaid enters Rekall was indeed just a memory trip.

Halloween," A number of firsts
","Halloween may have used Psycho's shower stabbing scene as inspiration for its own stabbing scene, but it invented The Undead Dead -- in which there is a false ending in which you think the villian has been defeated after being shot, stabbing, mutilated, etc, etc -- but is alive and attacks once more.",Null,0,0,1 December 1999
Casino," Finally won me over
","After seeing Casino on Starz for the umpteenth time, I find myself preferring it over Goodfellas, which is quite a switch, since I initially considered Casino a redo of Goodfellas.But the plot is much more complex and layered than Goodfellas, and the mournful ending has a certain strength. I loved the Sid Vicious 'My Way' at the end of Goodfellas, but Sam Rothstein bemoaning how Las Vegas has become a faceless Disneyland built on junk bonds is touching ('now when a whale comes in with a suitcase packed with millions, some high school student wants to check his social security number...'), especially when he takes off his shades at the end, and gazes sadly into space, reminiscing.",Null,1,1,25 November 2002
Goodfellas," Constantly imitated
","Even Martin Scorcese imitated his own film with 'Casino'. Quentin Tarantino, Paul Thomas Anderson, and a host of other wannabes have imitated the tone, the camera work and the style, but all they managed to do is imitate it. 'Goodfellas' set the tone for the Gen-X 90's mobster flick (previously always done in the style of Coppola's more mannered 'The Godfather'). Rather than Italian music, it used 70's music like Sid Vicious and other performers. Tarantino, Ritchie, and Anderson only wish they had Scorcese's style. Unfortunately, Scorcese wishes he had this style these days, too.",Null,0,0,4 March 2001
Beetlejuice," Dark, caring, and sometimes funny
","The opening credits begin with the Geffen logo and a melancholic rendition of 'Daylight comes... and me wanna go home.' Immediately Danny Elfman's wild score chirps right in. At once, you realize that while Elfman promises a light-hearted fare, the sincere wish of going home and not being able to will underscore the movie.When Adam and 'Babs' complain to Juno they wouldn't mind sharing their home with people different than the Deitz's, Juno finishes their thought by saying knowingly, 'With people more like YOU used to be.'So what is Beetlejuice about? It's really all about what makes a home. When you lose control of your home, is it still your home? As the old man once said, 'Home is what you make it.'That said, while Betelgeuse comments that every time he sees 'The Exorcist', he finds it funnier every single time he sees it, everytime *I* see 'Beetlejuice', I like it more and more, and I see new things every time as well. The movie is fresh Tim Burton, because he became a parody of himself during and after 'Batman Returns.'",Null,0,1,5 December 2000
