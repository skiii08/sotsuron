Child 44," Yawn
","It's like I really do want it I think that Tom hardy is a decent actor, but please someone tell him he doesn't need to put on a stupid accent in EVERY single film, overact and ruin it!
Apart from that, this could have been really good. But the pace, script, acting and , well, everything, was just so slow, dull and after an hour wasn't going anywhere so had to give up.",2,1,5,23 March 2018
American Hustle," How has this had any good ratings?
","Where to start....? Rambling script, waaaay too much dialogue, annoying characters. It's like someone thought ' let's make a film with loads of stars in flash 70's outfits, hype it up loads and see what happens'. Well the result is a total mess of a movie with sparks here and there of what it could have been, but wasn't. I rated it it two stars after falling asleep twice. Now I'm thinking that was generous",2,2,5,20 May 2017
Arrival," Yawnfest...
","Had high hopes for this film after seeing the trailers and review score. What a disappointment... Amy Adams & Jeremy Renner are just, well a bit dull as the leading actors. The script is awful The pace is slllllooooowwwww... you keep waiting for something to happen but it just doesn't. The characters have no depth. The military seem to have no clue what they are doing. As usual the USA is the only country in the world with any brains, the other countries trying to figure out the aliens have no idea, they portray the Aussies as a bit unintelligent lets say. I could go on, but to be honest I am going to spend my time looking for a better film to watch.I really don't understand the high reviews",2,13,24,21 January 2017
Annihilation," Yawn
","Had high hopes for this, but...
Bad script
Bad characters 
Bad choice of actors
Clearly no thought went into this film. Continuity is non existent, it is obviously intended to showcase strong women but actually achieves the opposite. The cast appear inexperienced, lacking in any survival skills, and incapable of, well, anything. Such a disappointment",2,14,28,16 March 2018
Alien: Covenant," Half way through review
","OK, so I'm half way through the latest Alien film, and some things to clarify (my opinion guys from someone that loves a good movie!)Alien 1 - iconic, awesome in it's day, now dated Aliens - awesome Alien 3 & 4, who even remembers those? Prometheus - biggest sell out load of cr@p from Ridley Scott ever. Awful film that made no sense and just capitalised on a few big stars of the moment (fassbender et al)So given that Prometheus was a relative flop an the cinema, didn't exactly set the world on fire in any critical acclaim way, WHY would you now make a prequel sequel that follows the film no- one liked?Bland characters that you just don't relate to Two fassbenders?? One is bad enough in this film Any why bring faith into sci-fi? Looking for extra media credit?Sorry Ridley, unless this gets better it's going to go down from 3...",3,3,6,7 July 2017
