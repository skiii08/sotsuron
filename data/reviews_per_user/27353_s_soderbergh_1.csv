Catch Me If You Can," One of Spielberg's Best
","This is easily one of Spielberg's best films. The acting was terrific. Tom Hanks was a little under his best performance ever, but wow is he a good actor. Leonardo was brilliant. I love this guy. It just proves that spielberg is getting better with age.",10,0,0,28 December 2002
