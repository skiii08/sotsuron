Blade Runner 2049," Loved most of it!
","I'm a big fan of Denis Villeneuve so I almost had a coronary when I heard he was directing the new Bladerunner sequel. The first thing I loved about 2049 was the atmosphere the filmmakers managed to create, which carried on nicely from the first movie - the connection was almost tangible. The imagery was breathtakingly beautiful and I thought the sound design and music were incredibly impressive. Ryan Gosling fit the main part perfectly and I loved the aura Villeneuve managed to create around him. The only two little criticisms I had was 1) the Jared Leto character was a tad boring and 2) as a young woman, I found the hologram scenes hard to watch at times (but this is possibly just my taste and not necessarily a fault of the film itself). All in all, it's a very good sequel - certainly one of the best I've seen.",9,7,15,17 October 2017
Mother!," Definitely an experience
","Having not been a huge Aronofsky fan in the past, I went into 'Mother!' with a completely open mind having not heard or read any reviews about it. I loved the creepy scenes with Bardem/Harris/Pfeiffer and I thought Jennifer Lawrence was amazing throughout. In all honesty, some of the scenes were very difficult to watch, but I imagine this is what was intended by the director and all I can say is that I went through many emotions whilst watching this film. Whether it is good or bad? I really, really loved the first half. The second half was very interesting to watch, but maybe not a pleasant viewing experience. But how many films nowadays can we honestly say is an 'experience' to watch? Not many. I'd like to see more filmmakers taking risks like this - uncomfortable as it was at times!",7,3,9,19 September 2017
