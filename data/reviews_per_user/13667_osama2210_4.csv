Scarface," an over hyped movie
","after i heard a lot about this movie, i decided to buy the DVD recently, i and i was shocked on how bad this movie is, indeed this movie is filled with mistakes and errors that are unbelievably left.the dialogue is so weak, the scenes are not linked properly, and the way the story develops is horrible, also the way the charterers develop is inconsistent during the whole movie, we see changing personalities of all the actors in this movie, it feels like a compilation of small different scenes that the director wished he ever included in a movie.Al Pacino is at his worst, he yells and shouts with meaningless scripts all over the movie, everyone around him just changes according to the scene, first we see the young rational sister who turns into a crazy whore by the mid of the movie, and we see Tony's enemies' assistants turning to his side without any reason! the scene where tony sees his sister for the first time in five years, it wasn't acted very well and didn't give any space for the characters to develop, after a couple of scenes we see Tony's sister yelling and shouting at him because he always interferes with her life!! how come?! they haven't seen each other for five years! another scene when Tony's sister falls for Manny, it was very silly watching how they suddenly fell in love! that all leads to the end where tony kills Manny, and his sister runs crying over his dead body telling tony that they just got married!, that scene was weak too.one stupid mistake in the movie appears in the end where Tony is first shot by his sister in the leg, but after 10 seconds he runs out of his office to fight like he wasn't shot at all!! and do we have to believe that Alex would come all the way to Tony to kill him after he was exposed in the UN!! this movie is a joke, and shows how violence and images have taken over the real art of movie making lately, this movie should have been forgotten long time ago to where it belongs in the cheesy 80's movie era",3,8,15,31 December 2007
Silent Hill," another cheap video-game movie....
","what's going on with movie directors when it comes to convert a video game to a movie!?..why all those awful acts and effects, and what is going on with the separated scenes!?...i mean at one time you see an actor in the mid of something that requires him to give a certain expression, but you see him in a mood that is not going with the scene, can't directors see that!!!well....where can i start?!!...the acting in this movie is so weak, the storyline is ridiculous, and the special effects are mediocre..it claims to be a horror movie, but it is filled with repeated 'scary' clichÃ©s that are no longer scary!! when you reach the end of the movie you will start wondering what is going on with the story! who's who?? and what is going on anyways??, it jumps from one side story to another without any 'harmony' or linked scenes.please avoid this stupid movie..",1,7,14,17 August 2006
Saw III," An awful new addition to an already awful franchise
","Although I hate this type of movies (gore and blood scenes filled into a movie without any artistic purpose just to attract the audience), I tried to be subjective and not-against Saw III, this was my second time to watch a Saw movie (and my last!) after Saw II.Even so I couldn't stop myself from noting poor acting, poor directing, and poor storyline (even for a movie of this type). The movie borrows many aspects that were used recently (and were good) by other movies; just take a look at how the movie ends, with 'surprise! That was me playing with your mind all the time!' scenes thrown all over the last minutes, which is very expected and overused. Expect another Saw movie when a new trend of movie clichés comes again.Nothing really special about Saw III, even the gore scenes are tedious, I think Saw II and Saw III are just pure commercial attempts to build on the success of the first part which was due to its new level of excessive use of violence. The movie story is so overused and stretched.A movie that must be avoided.",1,8,15,10 January 2007
The Happening," awful movie
","one of the worst movies i ever seen for a very long time, was very disappointed and angry to the point i wanted to take off my shoes and throw them on the screen.a shameful turn in M. Night Shymlan's ability in creating movies, that would make so many people to think a lot before going to watch any new offerings from him.I can't believe that a production company can pass on this piece of garbage to us to watch This movie has hit new lows of film making in all aspects; unbelievably very bad acting, lame story, poor direction... Please avoid it at all costs!",1,0,5,22 June 2008
