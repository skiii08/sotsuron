Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Who wants to be 'a kid again,' when...
","So you need to be a kid again to enjoy this flop? I guess it's true if being a kid means: ignoring incredibly bad writing, very droll delivery of lines by actors, immense (and frankly glaringly stupid) jumps in story logic, and enjoying: cloying racially degrading voice-overs, animated farts, characters with no explained motivation for what they are doing, entire segments based solely on the premise 'gee, that would look neat here.' Well---it does look neat there. But that is no reason to go to the theater, when watching animals in a zoo will provide as much plot continuity. The only struggle I have left is viewing this thing as somehow separate from the earlier trilogy. Indeed, that idea is all that is keeping me from being really, really sad.",5,0,1,25 May 1999
Casablanca," If I could be
","If I had to chose only one movie to be 'trapped' in, in some sort of virtual reality...it would be 'Casablanca.' Then I could try to get Rick to talk about his feelings. Then I could ask Ilsa what she sees in Laslo. Then I could sing along with Sam. And it would all end just the same way...except THREE friends would walk lazily off...into the fog.",10,0,0,11 May 1999
The English Patient," Juliet is joyous...
","Juliet Binoche will break your heart...and then return the pieces in a more beautiful whole. Her radiant performance as Hanna is simply the single greatest female performance of our time. She is asked to sustain human interest and a sense of both sadness and wonder. Her face does it all, and more. As the film flickers to her final goodbyes...the heart stops. You don't want the war, the sadness, the terror to end. Because with it will go the inspiration of a nurse who fought so hard to keep others alive, but had those closest to her die. She is the same nurse who commits the ultimate act of kindness despite her training and vows. Juliet's Oscar is a shining moment for Academy voters in recent years. They got it oh-so-right.",10,1,4,18 March 1999
Malcolm X," Most underrated film of the '90's?
","This is a brilliant mosaic of a man changed by words, ideas, emotions and strong beliefs. It surpasses in emotion the film 'Ghandi,' and at its heart is really an urban 'Lawrence of Arabia.' I was left numb viewing the scene of X's murder. His death was so needless, so wasteful. Yet Spike Lee does not over-glamorize X, who at one point tells a willing white girl that there is nothing she can do to help blacks. This is certainly one of the best films of the 1990's. One may not agree with X's views or beliefs, but you have to respect the man who will walk what he talks. And also respect Spike Lee for directing Denzel Washington's career-defining performance. Bravo.",9,3,10,3 May 1999
Empire of the Sun," 'Cadillac of the Sky!'
","Truly a 'Cadillac' among films. It is nice to see history finally catching up to the greatness of this film, which rarely takes a false step. The middle is perhaps a bit muddled and long, but it all serves an eventual purpose. And so many have misunderstood the angle Spielberg takes---the view of war through the eyes of the little boy. This gives the director the freedom to see things in fantastical terms without being considered overly 'Hollywood' or corny. The mainstream press just winced at the slow-motion glory of Christian Bale jumping up and yelling 'B-52, Cadillac of the sky!' as planes roared overhead. But---the scenes were magnificently filmed, and they captured the boy's preservation of his own child-like nature despite what he had endured. 'Empire of the Sun' has endured years labeled as a 'minor' Spielberg film. But I believe this is a film to carry over into the next century, and treasure anew.",9,0,2,18 March 1999
Dark City," Compact, Intense...
","I will say this about 'Dark City,' it delivers more intensity in 1 and 1/2 hours than 'The Matrix' does at over 2 hours. The look of Dark City is impressive, but I also feel the characters are distanced from the audience in a way that harms the overall impact. Even though 'The Matrix' is far 'hoakier,' at least we feel some kind of kinship with the characters. In 'Dark City' the characters are overwhelmed by their circumstances, and we never have a chance to feel anything for them. A few flashbacks don't do it. Since we are asked to follow 'John' on his journey to discovery, at some point we should care about what he discovers. We don't, we are just curious. The movie ends up proving its own worst fears---the virtual reality of cinema CAN dissolve what makes being human so great---the ability to feel, to understand and care---to follow the path of a soul we are rooting for. Dark City provides no such soul in the character 'John.",8,0,1,12 April 1999
The Usual Suspects," Unusually entertaining...
","I don't 'usually' go for shoot'em-up type flicks, but 'The Usual Suspects' is so ahead of the genre that I'm glad I rented the DVD recently. Kevin Spacey is great...but was he a supporting actor? Hmmmm. And the intelligent way the movie unravels is well done. The connection the killers have with each other is also an interesting sub-plot. They love each other like brothers, perhaps more. The ending is one of the best in film history!",9,0,1,12 April 1999
Life Is Beautiful," An un-even but charming mess...
","I can't figure out the fascination with this highly overrated film. The first hour is delightful, then we are asked to believe some quite outlandish behavior in the concentration camps. Would 'Guido' really risk his life to play a song on the PA system? It doesn't make sense to take this risk, in light of his efforts to save his son (which also fall short of believability.) I often am able to suspend my logic in favor of a romantic choice by a character. It is, after all, the movies. But is doesn't even work on that level, since so much time is dedicated to his single vision: save the boy from death or reality! There is no fear of the camp or even death in the film. So, Benigni's character's actions don't have a base in reality. Thus, we cannot feel compassion for the moment, even if we understand that we should feel it. It's the fault of the script and the director, who don't recognize that most of the audience would like the lead to be BOTH smart and charming, to be BOTH brave and funny, to be BOTH egocentric and understanding of others. Benigni's character comes off as a silly goof who doesn't see the poignancy of his own dilemma...so the movie-goer may miss it as well.",6,1,3,17 March 1999
Titanic," '...In every way that a person can be saved...'
","The tide will turn yet again: in light of watching the overly-wrought 'Gone With the Wind,' I say this...'Titanic' saves great thrills for its viewers, inviting us to understand what it means to be saved...in every way that a person can be saved. It is a brilliant homage to silent era films, with classic moments of dire terror, and bravado scenes of self-sacrifice. Watching this amazing film has taught me more about what it means to experience the joys and sorrows life brings us all. And to live each moment in a fuller way.",10,0,2,28 April 1999
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Lush on every level
","Beautifully shot, amazingly acted (even Holden seems good here) 'Bridge on the River Kwai' is lush on every level---especially the script, reportedly finished by blacklisted authors. I found this film far more engaging than 'Lawrence of Arabia,' perhaps because the people at the core of this gem were more 'human.' They took human idealism to all sorts of extremes. If you haven't seen this one...what in the world are you doing on the Imdb? Sign off and head to the video store---NOW!",10,0,1,29 April 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Magnificent Space Opera
","Stunning. 'Empire' is a magnificent space opera with soaring visuals, enthralling music...and a magnetic spiritual compass. I must agree with those who find this the best SW film. And also agree with those who believe it is one of the BEST FILMS of any genre. It is the SW film that is most watchable over and over, for the sheer beauty and flow of the story. Without 'Empire' the Star wars saga would be nothing but an over-hyper sugar ride video game. Admit it. This film IS the depth in the series.",10,0,0,11 May 1999
