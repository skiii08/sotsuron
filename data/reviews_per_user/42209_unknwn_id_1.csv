Mission: Impossible III," Good action, bad acting
","At the begin of the movie it looked like this would be a descent cruise action movie, i couldn't be more wrong. Let me just start with the bad camera-work, it was so irritating, in some scenes it was to far zoomed out or to far zoomed in, then if the camera angle was finally correct the camera man felled the need all the way through the movie to shake its camera like a roller-coaster, who hired this amateur?. OK the acting, this has to be one of the worst acting performances in this year, and yes i mean you tom. He just looks silly the entire movie, and when there is a serious scene he just moves his mouth-angle a little and thats it, completely emotionless.. And you know what the best part of it is, he gets away with it, the cinemas will be full anyway and if there will come a Mi4 it will be just the same. Further, the rest of the crew was even worse, ethans wife for example did such a bad performance i'm not even going to waste any time on that. The only one who saved this movie was Mr Hoffman, he played terrific as the bad guy and i felled the director held him from going on full 100 % not to overshadow cruise. The director did such a bad job directing this movie full of plot holes and laughable story lines i don't even know where to start so i'm not going to. I think the reason for the bad acting was that after the actors read the script they knew this movie was going to suck so they just decided not to give any acting at all and put there self on autopilot. There is one positive point about this movie, it had some very nice action in it, and the adrenaline pumps the entire movie. If u want to see good action, explosions, and don't mind the story line, acting and bad camera-work this movie is for u. If not, don't see it.. cause this is just a 120 minute commercial for tom cruise and it wasn't even a good one. 6/10",6,0,1,5 June 2006
