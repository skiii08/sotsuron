Miracle," The best since 'Mighty Ducks'!
","This is another one of these true sports story flicks. All of that has actually happened when I was born. This film is Kurt Russell at his very best. I loved Kurt Russell in his earlier Disney films. Russell portrays late coach, Herb Brooks. Brooks wanted to change a style of play in Olympic Hockey. He chose amateur players, instead of Pro players. This is a perfect family film. Sit through the film ending and it tells you where those players are now. (Just like Remember The Titans) This film is basically about the USA and their victory over the then-Soviet Hockey team. This film has an awesome opening which is a timeline of what happened up till 1980.",10,1,1,1 February 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Best fantasy/children's flick!
","I just saw this flick and it was awesome. When I was 10 years old, I saw the animated version of this on The Disney Channel. Aslan is a really majestic and regal lion. The evil white witch thinks she is the queen. The four children, Peter, Edmond, Susan & Lucy are sent to a hostel when a war breaks out. Lucy plays in the hostel and notices a magical wardrobe. The wardrobe takes the 4 children to the magical kingdom of Narnia. Whoever defeated the evil white witch ruled Narnia and restored peace and order. This film is loosely based on the C.S. Lewis novel. I highly recommend this film for everyone. If you like fantasy flicks like the Harry Potter series, you will find this film enjoyable.",10,0,1,26 December 2005
Batman Begins," Superb Storyline! A must for all Batman fans!
","I have seen this film last night and caught the midnight screening. This is all about the birth of Batman. Most of the actors are British. Sir Michael Caine did a good job playing Bruce Wayne's butler, Alfred Pennyworth. Welshman Christian Bale did a real good job as Bruce Wayne & Batman. The beginning was so intense. This film also introduces us to 2 of Batmans enemies: Ra's Al Ghoul & The Scarecrow. I love the weaponry. If you liked Batman from 1989 & Batman Returns from 1992, you've gotta see this. It's kinda like James Bond, because Lucius Fox (portrayed by Morgan Freeman) shows Bruce Wayne the car and the weapons.",10,0,0,15 June 2005
Glory Road," Simply the best, since 'Remember The Titans'.
","I just caught this flick. This movie is so awesome. Like 'Remember The Titans', this film was also produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. It's basically about a high school girls' basketball coach, who coaches Texas Western basketball team. He scouts mostly African-American boys with full basketball potential. This film is basically 'Remember The Titans' with basketball, mainly because this film contains ethnic issues. Many viewers will be horrified with the use of ethnic slurs. The story takes place in the 1960's. You should see the ending sequence, because it simply tells you where those basketball players are now. (Just like Miracle, Rookie & Remember The Titans).",10,2,8,1 February 2006
