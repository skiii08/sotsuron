Ford v Ferrari," Excellent!
","I'm not a motorhead or fan of motor sports at all. Yet, I found this to be a very compelling story. Well done, from he performances of the cast, the cinematography, the writing, everything was spot on. I was a bit skeptical when I saw it came in at 2 1/2 hours, thinking there was going to be a lot of self indulgent scenes, but I was surprised to find none of that. The time flew by faster than the cars.",9,1,2,18 November 2019
