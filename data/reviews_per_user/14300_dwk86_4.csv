Raiders of the Lost Ark," My Favorite Movie Of All Time
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is my favorite movie of all time. It is a classic Steven Spielberg adventure movie. Packed with pretty much every genre, it is something for all movie lovers and almost everyone. Hollywood doesn't make movies like this anymore. Motion pictures were invented to entertain, and this one entertains a great deal. Some of it may seem a bit campy, but that is why it is so great. It is just a plain fun and enjoyable movie. I wish, like I hinted at earlier, that a movie like this would come out nowadays. It will leave you and your sense of fun very satisfied. You'll have a great time watching this movie.",10,2,4,23 June 2010
Singin' in the Rain," Watch When You Are Having A Bad Day
","Singin' In The Rain is probably the most cheerful movie musical ever made. It is full of good acting, great songs, and unforgettable dancing. The best time to watch it is when you are having a bad day. You'll almost immediately be cheered up. Not many movies really have that ability. Here is what I think the top five songs are. 1. Singin' In The Rain 2. Make 'Em Laugh 3. Good Morning 4. All I Do Is Dream Of You 5. Would You. There you have it. Singin' In The Rain is a wonderful movie that will leave you smiling. Best movie ever made? No. But it sure comes close. It's certainly better than all modern day musicals. Nobody can dance like Gene Kelly. His moves in this movie are harder than they look.",10,0,1,25 June 2010
Super 8," No E.T., But Still Good
","The subject and people behind 'Super 8' made me look forward to it very much. I was hoping that it would be like 'E.T.' and other Steven Spielberg movies. After seeing it, I don't think that its quality matches 'E.T.', but it's still good. 'Super 8' is directed by J.J. Abrams, and co-produced by Steven Spielberg. It is science fiction, and it has a decent sense of adventure. One of the reasons why I like 'E.T.' better is that some of this movie's scenes were too loud and chaotic. The bike chase at the end of 'E.T.' is thrilling, and one of the reasons why is because there's just the right amount of things going on that you really get involved with what's happening to the characters. Sometimes 'Super 8' contained too much chaos. Michael Giacchino ('Star Trek','Up')composed the music, so it was pretty good, although I wish the movie had a recognizable theme. With a few exceptions, not many movies these days have musical themes. The suspense was good, and the acting wasn't bad. I think that the movie lacked a good chase scene, which would have made it more fun. Overall, I liked it, and I guess if I were asked, I would see it again.",8,1,6,9 June 2011
Rear Window," Smart Thriller, Although Climax Could Have Been Better
","Rear Window is a smart thriller. With well-written dialogue, a great cast, and mounting suspense, it proves that a movie can be good even if the setting never changes. Although I liked the very end, which concludes the stories of all the different people Jimmy Stewart's character has been watching, the climax could have been a bit better. It ends too abruptly. Other than that, Alfred Hitchcock scores again. Not many other directors could have turned the somewhat simple story that Rear Window is into a great movie. Hitchcock would have turned 111 years old last Friday. Although he never won an Academy Award, he had a very long and successful movie career, and had a family that he loved very much.",8,0,1,16 August 2010
