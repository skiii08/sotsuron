The Blair Witch Project," What is all the fuss about???? Boring!!!!
","After reading endless reviews praising this movie, I was really looking forward to seeing it.  It has been a long time since I saw a really scary movie.  Unfortunately, after seeing this film I am still wanting to see a really scary movie. The acting is bad, the footage shaky home video or bad b&w 35 mm.  The plot is pretty much non-existent.  No characters really develop, and the thing just generally flounders around for 90 minutes before drawing to a close. 
This films biggest problem is the *tremendous* amount of hype about it. None of it is deserved.  This just simply isn't a scary movie unless you are 8 years old and haven't progressed beyond the stage where any noise in the dark scares you.  If you find twigs hanging from a tree and piles of rocks scary, then this movie is for you.  Otherwise, you will suffer thru 85 minutes of it to get to final 3 minutes, which are almost bearable but still not that scary.  
By the way, I was so p**sed off by this movie that while riding the elevator up to my apartment, I commented to the couple riding up with me [complete strangers] that 'If you were thinking of seeing Blair Witch Project, save your money'   Imagine my surprise when I found out that they were at the same neighbourhood theatre as I was and agreed with me 100%.  The woman of the couple commented that it was the worst film she'd ever seen.  The male of the couple commented that it was a good thing we went to see it on Tuesday, when movies are only $5.  'Imagine how disappointed you'd been if it cost you $10'
Maybe I am just missing something here.  If you think I'm out to lunch on this one, then let me know.  If you thought this was great, why??  And if you found it scary, again, Why??
