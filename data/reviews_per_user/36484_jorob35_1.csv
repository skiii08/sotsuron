Skyfall," Skyfall
","Skyfall is an excellent modern espionage film, and a worthy predecessor to Casino Royal. The thematic elements of the film are quite provocative and relevant to our era. In an age of abundant technology, Skyfall challenges our perception concerning state of the art tools. Bond, the protagonist, is armed throughout the movie with relatively simplistic weapons. Furthermore, Bond accomplishes feats considered impossible for his physical condition. 007 however is a master within the field, and relies on his intuition, expertise, and mental fortitude to accomplish seemingly impossible feats. He does so with a sense of sacrifice, enabling personal resurrection despite circumstances where he remains expendable for a larger cause. Silva, the antagonist, represents modernity's rampant spiritual hypocrisy. Striking meditative poses and delivering lines such as 'Remember your sins'. He shows that spirituality can encourage unethical deeds, even though its obvious he hasn't followed his patterns of thought to logical conclusions. For instance, Silva has no sense of forgiveness, and would rather plot and scheme ultimate acts of vengeance. His terrorism is oriented around technology, revealing our over-reliance on modern contrivances. Overall, I enjoyed the acting, direction, editing, score, and film aesthetics 'with pleasure'. An unanswered question remains, whether the global society is shifting towards consolidation or diversity, how do responsible groups maintain an ethical way of existence?",Null,11,16,13 February 2013
