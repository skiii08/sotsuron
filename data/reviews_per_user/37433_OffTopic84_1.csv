Men in Black 3," Sweet Bromance, good sequel
","With all the wannabe haters out there who bash everything because what Hollywood comes out with does not meet their narrow minded standards, I am happy to report that Men in Black 3 is a return to the original. Okay, so there are no worms or Frankie, but rather an emotional human drama that is sweet, tear jerky and a damn good science fiction film.Josh Brolin is brilliant as young K, and the back story between him and Jay is explained slowly and you will cheer for them both. Frankie, my favorite alien, no longer alive makes sweet cameos and by far and away you will fall in love with the wise Doctor-Who/Luke Skywalker inspiration Griffin, the movie's best alien and the best helpful guide since Yoda.In between Andy Warhol and some lingering racism, this movie while light years better than the second installment, does not rise to stardom like 'The Empire Strikes Back'. All in all however, a good science fiction bromance is worth seeing. 8 out of 10.",8,1,6,26 May 2012
