The Blair Witch Project," scariest film ever
","Forget Halloween. Forget Scream. Forget even the Exorcist. This is the best Horror film ever made, quite simply because, whether you like to admit it or not, it creeps you out.I remember the night my brother and cousin went to see it in the cinema, and afterwards, my cousin who is in his twenties, didn't want to walk home by himself.This is a film that takes one of the most obvious horror stereotypes- the big bad witch- removes all the cheesiness of 90% of the horrors we see nowadays- and replaces it with a brilliantly made movie that scared the bejesus outta me.Its simple really- three film makers- Heather, Josh, and Mike- make their way into the woods to make a documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch.What begins as an enjoyable film making experience quickly turns into something different as they face a terrifying experience, lost in the woods with SOMETHING after them.What I liked most about the film is that its shot in a documentary style, every moment of their terrifying experience is seen first hand. The two directors promoted the film by saying it was real footage- and you forget at times that its just a film.There are some real terrifying moments. The discovery of that now famous Blair Witch symbol hanging from the trees, to the tent shaking, and then the final scene in the house.I believe that this is how a horror film should be made. No big breasted dumbass running up the stairs instead of the safety of the front door to escape the clutches of a crazed serial killer. What the directors have done here is they have taken a genuine fear for some people- lost in the woods- and played on it in the scariest way possible.I don't think that this film has the rating it deserves on IMDb. I doubt I'll ever see a horror like it again also.",7,0,1,10 January 2008
Cloverfield," a film for those with an imagination.......
","Do you like films with realistic story lines where everything is sorted at the end? If you do, then DON'T see Cloverfield. If you like films that take your breath away and have you talking about it for weeks after, then DO see Cloverfield. I, for one, thought that this was one of the best movies I had seen in a long time. It's so easy to get bored with a film and lose interest in it these days. This doesn't happen in Cloverfield (well, after the first twenty minutes anyway).The film is all filmed hand-held. The last time that happened with good results with 'The Blair Witch Project'. It opens with the two main characters Rob and Beth enjoying a fun day. It then skips to a going away party for Rob a few months after. Rob is going to Japan as part of a job promotion. But whats dominating his thoughts that night is the fact that the love of his life Beth is now with somebody else. So while Robs best friend Hud is having people record going away messages for Rob, Rob and Beth are arguing which leads to Beth leaving the party.I know it sounds all very Dawsons Creek, but bear with it. Out of nowhere, the party is interrupted by a bang and the lights go out. Everyone is a little bit shaken up but appear to calm down after the media reports it as a 'small earth quake'. Then the Statue of Liberty's head is knocked down the street and the whole City is faced with something they never thought possible.This is when the adrenaline begins to rise. You will watch Rob's, Beth's, Marlena's and Hud's search for safety as if you were there with them. It's an edge of your seat thrill ride that you wont be able to take your eyes off.In the months leading up to the release of Cloverfield, director JJ Abrahams of 'Lost' fame released many a teaser without giving too much away. What a stroke of genius. It all added to the mystery of the movie and was the perfect way to advertise it.The tag line reads- 'Some Thing has Found Us'- yes it certainly has. A fresh new type of movie that I loved.",8,1,2,27 June 2008
Once," see it more than once
","There are very few films that will make you want to watch it again straight after the credits roll. Thats the difference between a good film and a great film. And Once is certainly a great film. Great music, great, simple story and wonderful performances.What makes this film even more extraordinary is that it stars musicians, not actors. But looking at the film, you would think Marketa Irglova and Glen Hansard had been acting for years. Such was the chemistry between the two in the film, they are now actually a couple.Once is set in Dublin and tells the story of a busker who meets a young immigrant. They quickly become drawn together through music and personal problems which sets the stage for a moving, funny, and endlessly watchable film which I cant recommend highly enough.",9,2,3,8 January 2008
The Orphanage," big let down
","I've always been a fan of foreign language films. And, I've also been a fan of horror films. So I was really looking forward to The Orphanage as I felt that the film had the potential to be a great thrill fest.But despite this, I was left thinking what might have been and slightly baffled as to why this film was such a let down. Directed by Spanish first timer Juan Antonio Bayona, the film see's Laura, who grew up an orphan herself, raising her adopted son Simón with her husband Carlos in an old house and former orphanage where she was raised. Simón is HIV positive, and both parents hope that the boy can settle in well to his new surroundings. All seems to be going well until Simon tells Laura that he has five invisible friends. Taking on her husbands advice that their son is only trying to escape boredom by inventing these 'friends', Laura laughs off her sons comment and seems happy to play along with it. But in true horror movie style, things start to go 'bump in the night', and Laura begins to wonder if in fact, they are alone. And on the day that she officially re-opens the orphanage for disabled children, Simon is kidnapped, which leads his parents and the police on to a wild goose chase in the hope of his safe return. It all sounds like a great premise to a good movie, and while the Orphanage isn't all that bad, there are quite simply not enough big moments in the film to warrant it a five star rating. Many of the supposed edge of your seat scenes are a let down, the creepy old woman, who for some reason feels that she would be useful with a shovel, is just annoying, and the film goes for long sequences that produce absolutely nothing.I do have to give credit where it's due though. Belena Rueda, who plays Laura, is terrific throughout, and some of the cinematography is excellent, but folks, if you want a good spooky story about a haunted house, go rent The Others again.",4,7,13,1 August 2008
Good Will Hunting," such a great movie
","I watched this movie for the first time last week and I was astounded. This really is a great movie that will have you thinking about it in the days after you watch it. The cast are great, the writings great, and the story is great.I love these kind of films. There are far too man films made these days that tell you nothing. This is a special movie that you will walk away from with a smile on your face and a determination to do something more with yourself.Matt Damon is quickly becoming one of my favourite actors now, and his performance here is superb, the same goes for Robin Williams. Minnie Driver is another actress who is supremely talented. Every individual involved gets top marks.Good Will Hunting is a fantastic movie, one I will no doubt watch again and again.",8,1,4,3 June 2009
Million Dollar Baby," watch it..... then watch it again
","We have all seen the Rocky films, and we have all seen Raging Bull. Million Dollar Baby, directed by Clint Eastwood, deserves to sit alongside these terrific boxing films. Great cast, great story, and great direction from Eastwood.When I first sat down to watch this movie I thought that it was just going to be very similar to Rocky, with a girl making her way to the top. But its so much more than that. The film is a powerful and moving experience to sit through.Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), is an experienced and successful Boxing trainer who runs a training gym with long time friend 'Scrap' (Morgan Freeman). Although Frankie appears to be a tough strict, man, he is secretly hiding a heartbreak involving his daughter, who he has made a lot of failed attempts to get in contact with her over the years. Oh yeah, and he 'doesn't train girls'. His work and lack of faith are the two main elements of his life, until Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) walks into his gym.Admiring Maggies work rate and attitude, Frankie eventually takes Maggie under his wing, beginning a relationship that see's Frankie develop her into a terrific boxer. The pairs relationship grows and it becomes clear that Frankie may have found the long lost daughter he's been looking for. The two are all each other have, and one horrific incident results in them facing a battle tougher than what they could ever face in a boxing ring.I couldn't take my eyes off this movie and I was very moved by the performances. Easily a film you will watch again and again.",8,3,4,13 April 2008
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Innocence meets evil
","It has been thus far a fantastic year for film. We've had the return of the Caped Crusader, and seen a gigantic monster attack New York City.It's very likely that everyone will remember 2008 as the year of The Dark Knight and Cloverfield, but with The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, we have a film I feel deserves to stand aside these two Hollywood blockbusters. There have been many films based on the Holocaust over the years, most notably Schindler's List, and many people will feel that maybe they've seen enough of one of the darkest chapters in human history. But The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is very different to its predecessors. Based on the best-selling novel by John Boyne, the film is told through the eyes of Bruno, a young German boy. Bruno's happy care free life is turned upside down when he's told he has to move from his home in Berlin to a desolate area on the outside of the city. What Bruno doesn't know is that his father, a German Commander, is being sent there to take charge of a Concentration Camp, which is holding many innocent Jews as prisoners. Bruno quickly becomes subdued and bored with his new surroundings, where there isn't too much exploring to be done and no one to play with- until he meets Shmuel.Shmuel is one of the prisoners being held at the camp and he and Bruno quickly strike a friendship. The connection between the two boys is a touching contrast from what is taking place all around them, but the friendship becomes more and more dangerous for the two youngsters with inevitable tragic consequences.Despite not having the scale of film making that Spielberg produced in Schindler's List, this is a film that is very well made. It features some fantastic cinematography, and has great acting all around, especially from Bruno's mother (played by Vera Farminga, from the Oscar winning The Departed). The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is touching, shocking, horrific and tragic rolled into one. It is the story of innocence up against one of the world's greatest tragedies. One that will have you talking long after the credits have rolled.",7,4,7,25 September 2008
The Dark Knight," Close the betting on the Oscars
","Best Film 2008: The Dark Knight, Best Director: Christopher Nolan, The Dark Knight, Best Actor: Heath Ledger, The Joker, The Dark Knight.Well, those will be the Oscar results if there's any justice. The Superhero has always been a huge genre in the film world, and The Dark Knight sets the bar way way high. I would like to begin this review by talking about Christopher Nolan. Batman and Batman returns were good movies. Then what followed were Jim Carey, Val Kilmer, George Clooney, Nicole Kidman, Tommy Lee Jones etc etc doing their almighty best to ruin Batman. Movies that were just about making huge amounts of money and not giving a damn about the history of Batman. But thanks to Nolan, Batman has reached the top of the mountain as the best superhero out there. Following on from the outstanding Batman Begins, this film was always going to have a tough job to make Batman even better. We rejoin the Bat (Christian Bale) as he continues his fight against the mob who have gained a new friend. And his name's The Joker (Heath Ledger), the greatest villain of this generation. Which brings me to Heath Ledger. Now after his death in January of this year, many pessimists will use that as the sole reason as to why everyone was so impressed with his performance. But, quite simply, Ledger is fantastic. Evil, arrogant and downright hilarious, he makes The Joker role his own.Batman appears to have gained his own friend in charismatic Distric Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhat). Dent is an elected official who is determined to stamp out crime in Gotham City. Both have Commissioner Gordon on their side, played by the terrific Gary Oldman, and are both battling for the heart of Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal).The Dark Knight is an amazing spectacle. Every performance is fantastic (a big shout out also to Michael Caine who is terrific again as Alfred), the action scenes are immense, and the direction of Nolan immense. The film, at a length of over 2 hours, flies by, and once the credits roll you'll be disappointed its all over- after you've finished applauding that is.Quite simply: fantastic.",9,1,4,24 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," did the director read the whole book?
","There have been some films that have done the books justice. Top of my head, The Green Mile and Shawshank Redemption were turned into great films. And while Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire isn't a complete waste of a movie, as an avid fan of the books, I have to say I was disappointed.The film begins with Harry having a nightmare which I wont go into detail about here, as it is a key scene in the movie. Harry and Hermione are staying with the Weasleys, as they are going to watch the final of the Quidditch World Cup between Ireland and Bulgaria. It is at the final where the first significant part of the movie takes place, with those attending the match attacked by death eaters and Voldermorts symbol, 'The Dark Mark', appearing in the sky.So, with the wizard world in a state of panic over the appearance of the symbol, Harry, Hermione and Ron return to Hogwarts for their third year. Upon their arrival they are met with the announcement that Hogwarts has been chosen to host the Triwizards Tournament, and that pupils form two other schools, Drumstang and Beuxbaton, will also be taking part.The tournament involves three dangerous tasks, and despite not entering the competition, Harry is chosen as one of the competitors. All three tasks test Harry to the limit, not least the final task, which leads to a shocking conclusion.A good film overall, but a lot was left out from the book which I felt would have made the film even better.",7,0,0,12 November 2008
The Departed," ''give me that Oscar''
","As Martin Scorsese collected the Best Director Oscar for The Departed he jokingly began his speech by asking 'Could you check the envelope again??' This came after an extended show of respect from the crowd for a man who should have walked those steps many years ago. It is a fact of life that you aren't going to win every time. But to not win at all with movies like Taxi Driver, Casino, and especially Goodfellas, well, thats just an injustice. As his name was called out it seemed a collective sigh of relief swept over the film industry as finally the man who has battled long and hard collected his award.Scorsese stepped outside his gangster film making home last time out to tackle the biopic with 'The Aviator', with mixed reviews. Although not a bad film, it wasn't the Scorsese we've come to know, and it was time to get back to basics in the search for that elusive Oscar. 'The Departed' tells the story of two men from opposite sides of the law ,undercover within the Massachusetts State Police and the Irish mafia. The State Police's aim, led by Detectives Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) and Queenan (Martin Sheen), is to take down Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), who has been terrorising the City for years. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), is assigned the unattractive role of going undercover in attempt to do so. Costello's hand is made up of Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), who is his mole in the Police Department. To add to the tension, both Sullivan and Costigan fall for the same girl, shrink Madolyn (Vera Farmiga). The story is as intriguing as it gets, and the acting is superb on all corners, including the terrific Alec Baldwin. Jack Nicholson is immense, DiCaprios improvement away from the bay faced actor continues, and Damon is one of the best actors around full stop. My only annoyance is that Robert De Niro, a man who has forged a great partnership with Scorsese over the years, didn't feature in the film that finally got the great man an Oscar.",8,2,4,5 August 2008
The Wrestler," the toughest battles wait outside the ring
","The year may have just begun, but I am going to put my neck out and say that I may have already seen the best 09' has to offer. The best films are the one's where you sit watching and you genuinely care what is going to happen to the people in the film. You feel like you are looking at events in at the life of someone you know or are rooting for. The Wrestler is one of those movies. Quite simply, it is a touching, phenomenal look at a very troubled life. Non-wrestling fans DO NOT be put off, this is a movie everyone should see. Randy ''The Ram'' Robinson had it all as a wrestler in the 80's. He was at the very pinnacle of sports entertainment and was adored by wrestling fans world wide. The start of the movie outlines this with some of the highlights of Randy's career shown in magazine cut outs and photos. One of the aspects I enjoyed most about the movie was the way it portrayed the sport of wrestling. What annoys me is that a lot of people consider wrestling just to be costumes and 'fake' punches, but it's a lot more than that, and I hope after seeing this movie you'll agree. The present day, is a different story for The Ram. Twenty years later, and Randy is working in the Independent Wrestling World, with no money, relationship problems, a drug habit, and he has just been evicted from his trailer. Mickey Rourke, who is known to have his own troubled life, was probably made for this role, and his performance is dare say Oscar worthy. The film at times is like watching a real life documentary; such is the scale of the performance from Rourke. The toughest battle in the life of Robinson is one more severe than anything he has ever faced in the ring, his attempt at reconciling with his daughter. So after a near fatal heart attack, with the help of single mother/stripper Cassidy (Marissa Tomei), Randy bids to win back the trust of Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood), who has shut her father out of her life. The Wrestler was made with a small budget, but with a very big heart. Touching story, terrific performances, it's a movie you'll be happy to have a rematch with again and again.",8,0,0,27 January 2009
The Breakfast Club," a film that every parent and teen should see
","There are films that tell you nothing. There are films that will make you laugh but have no real meaning, and there are films that have meaning but will leave you somewhat depressed afterwards. The Breakfast Club is different. This is a film that will make you laugh, think, cry, and laugh some more. I only saw this film for the first time last year and kicked myself for not seeing it sooner. It is a fantastic film about the pressures that every teenager will have to face in their lifetime, a film that will bring up a problem that anyone watching can relate to one way or the other.I for one like a film with a simple storyline, and this one has a pretty simple one. Five teenagers are forced to spend a Saturday in detention. Simple as that. But these five youngsters are very different from one another. Andrew Clark- The tough guy who thrives to be the best; Brian Johnson- The Grade A student. John Bender- The loud mouth nuisance. Molly Ringwald- The Prom Queen, and Ally Sheedy- the weirdo.5 very different people. One classroom, and a hard nosed teacher to deal with. They begin the day clearly frustrated at the thought of spending a Saturday with one another, but by the end their lives will have changed forever and they will realise that they are not so different.Overall, this is a funny and touching movie that you will be happy to watch over and over again.",7,1,2,8 January 2008
