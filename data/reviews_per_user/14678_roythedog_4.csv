United 93," Why I enjoy this movie, there are some faults.
","This is one of the greatest historical movies of all time, because of the genuine commitment to historical accuracy, the emotion and rawness that can make your heart race, and the last 15 minutes of the movie. I have studied 9/11 for many years and written several papers on it and even wrote a book on it. My interest in the subject is because my dad lost his best friend that day and my high school English teacher lost his brother. The company my dad worked for at the time lost 4 people including another of my dad's friends.There are some genuine historical inaccuracies here. The actor who played Saeed Al-Ghamdi, looked way too old to be him as he was 23 at the time of the attacks. Ahmed Al-Haznawi would have had facial hair, and Zaid Jarrah didn't have a cleft chin. However, I greatly respect how this movie portrayed the passenger revolt as it wasn't just 4 heroes, every passenger on the plane played a part. Although the younger male passengers lead the revolt, it was the flight attendants who helped them organize weapons and a plan. The one scene that really stuck with me from this movie is during the passenger revolt when Jeremy Glick snaps Ahmed Al-Nami's neck as Richard Guadagno rips the knife out of his hands. I know they couldn't cast perfect dead ringers for all the passengers, but I do greatly respect Greengrass' efforts to genuinely capture the raw hostility and fear even forcing the actors who played the hijackers and the actors who played the passengers and crew to not interact outside of filming. Overall a 10 out of 10 and a genuine powerful tearjerker everyone should watch at least once.",10,0,1,31 May 2020
The Day After Tomorrow," If your willing to see this movie for what it truly is you will enjoy it
",Yes this movie is full of scientific inaccuracies and some political commentary. However if your willing to look past that and see this film as a campy and over dramatic disaster movie then you will enjoy it. The characters in the movie are likable and the ending was a standard happy ending. As I said though if your willing to look past the cliques and campy elements then you can appreciate this film. I think this was certainly one of Dennis Quaid's more memorable roles. None of the scenes will really make you cry or anything but it's still enjoyable and that's what matters.,10,3,3,17 April 2020
Hotel Rwanda," More powerful and moving then even Schindler's list
","This was a rare case for me of a piece of media being genuinely hard for me to sit through. Some of the scenes in this movie are so powerful, sad, and tearjerking. The scene where all the orphanage children show up at Paul's hotel and are informed they can't leave the country and the scene where Paul's family and some of the other refugees are almost murdered by the Hutu militia were extremely painful to watch. The movie is powerful even from the beginning with the jarring scene of a box of machetes spilling out and the Hutu militia leader bribing Paul with more half priced beer. Nick Nolte also gives a powerful performance. You can tell he really feels bad about not being able to do anything about what's going on around him. The best performance in this movie however, is Don Cheadle who plays a perfect strong straight man character as Paul who must fill several roles and a balancing act to protect everyone he can and be strong for his family. It truly is one of the most powerful and moving films I have ever seen.",10,0,0,24 April 2020
Armageddon," Meh
","Two end of the world movies came out in 1998. This and Deep Impact. This movie had a very star studded cast and Deep Impact was still better. The story although entertaining was clique with another clique ending. Deep Impact can make you cry. This movie honestly can't. Bruce Willis wasn't made for the dramatic goodbye scene. Overall this movie is a meh. It's not terrible but it's not that good either, despite the cast.",7,1,3,22 January 2020
