Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Super-stylish, steampunky fun for everyone!
","Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is as good, if not better than its predecessor 'Sherlock Holmes'. Robert Downey Jnr. and Jude Law reprise their roles as Homes and Watson respectively, giving expected, predictable, but absolutely fantastic performances. Downey Jnr's histrionic performance and Law's straight faced ex-military doctor has such brilliant chemistry between them, clearly the actors themselves like each other(although, they seem more like a married couple than friends). The camera work is clever, and the editing is fast-paced and very Hollywood. In a good way. The smoky, dusty, steamy, misty cityscape of victorian London is iconic, British, and provides a stable substrate for the real action to take place.Dialogue is simple, effective and funny, especially Holmes, often switching between English and French, with wisps of German thrown in. But don't worry, there are no subtitles and the narrative is easily followable even if the words are gibberish. Noomi Rapace (Girl with a Dragon tattoo Original) is the cunning (and remarkably sexy) gypsy who helps Holmes and Watson to deduce the tricks and traps laid by the fabulous Moriarty. Moriarty amazingly portrayed by Jared Harris, and is possibly the best character in the whole film. Cool, calm, but very very intimidating, Harris uses his silence to scare the audience and is the binary opposite to Holmes, but yet very similar in some ways. I won't say much, but the final scene is sensationally composed by the former 'cult' director Guy Ritchie. You don't need to see the original film to be able to follow A Game of Shadows' narrative. In fact, there aren't really any references to the first film at all. If you like a stunning visual style, with British brains and American brauns then Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is definitely suitable for you! 9/10",9,1,2,30 December 2011
Gran Torino," A master class in film-making
","Gran Torino (2008, Eastwood) is a great movie for anyone. For the more engrossed film analyst you can read the controversial views into it. If I go into much depth here I am in danger of ruining the story, so I won't.The only aspect of this film I could flaw was the acting of Thao and Sue sometimes. It just felt slightly fake sometimes. The music is absolutely fantastic (it reminded me partly of Unforgiven) and people yet to hear about the soundtrack will be glad to know that Clint actually SINGS! The cinematography is superb with certain shots just pieces of art on the move. One particular still of Clint's role, Walt, was just superb. He was out the front of his house, sitting back on his chair in the sunset, with his dog below and the Gran Torino lower still. It clearly showed the levels of respect that Clint had accumulated from turning vigilante. This film is great. Deep philosophical questions, discussions on justice and messages regarding friendships can all be taken from this film. Whilst also you can sit back after a few beers and read little into the film and still enjoy the film a great deal. This film is compatible with almost anyone.",9,0,3,3 March 2011
