Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I didn't believe it...
","... this is a very good movie, very good funny movie. I like it. We can see a new sort of humor used by Borat. But, was is truly very important it is not a movie about a poor country Afganistan, nor about a stupid guy moving trough Unitedstates and making report for government of Kazachstan, but it is a joke from ourselves. Truly, we can see our way of behavior in the eyes of person from other part of the world. And we can, actually, be pushed to think about it. We are not alone on this Earth, there are lots of nations living with us and they do not have the same roots or historical values as we have. In the same time this nations see, that we are leaving wealthy lives in our countries and they are, mostly poor. .... you will see a lots of humor, action and jokes. It is not static, nor boring. I enjoyed. I really did. I laugh on the whole cinema. Thats what I didn't use to do :)",8,1,6,4 December 2006
World Trade Center," I hope, Ill wake up in the morning and find this was a dream! A bed one!
","... on the first look it seems like a good film. Just imagine how many interesting scenarios could be written with very interesting ideas. But not this time. Not this time. I didn't see so many production and scenario blunders as in this film. Jesus Christ with packed water! for example. We, film-goers, we were laughing at the sad part because of mistakes the production did. One the beginning we see a 'bunch' of gyus doing theirs work in the NYcity, in 10 minutes we are lieing in the WTO shambeles and guess what? A brave American soldier comes to save their lives, nobody, but he. Meanwhile our gyus are talking together about 'a nice' weather, just imagine ourselves in such a situation. And in the end the soldier find our Metropolian Police Staff wit 1000s of people helping him to move the bodies from the WTO. I hope, Ill wake up in the morning and find this was a dream! A bed one!",1,9,18,12 October 2006
