The Hangover," hahahah
","I loved this movie and have seen it a dozen times. Lots of one liners and funny scenes. My favorite scene is with the taze gun. I lmao at that one. This was a great cast but Galifinakis really made me laugh the hardest. He's so offbeat. It's great. I'm really a fan of Ed Helms too and he always comes up with some funny stuff. There was a lot of hype surrounding this movie when it came out, but it most definitely delivered for me. So many great quotes in this movie too. I don't know where to begin. The cast really did mesh well together though. Great supporting performances by Rachel Harris and even an appearance by the great Dan Band. They perform a couple songs at the end of the movie when the wedding finally occurs. I recommend this movie only if you want to laugh your arse off.",10,1,2,2 September 2010
