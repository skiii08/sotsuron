Vertigo," The Best Movie Ever!!!!
","This is the best movie I have ever seen.  As a fan of Alfred Hitchcock films, I have seen many, this is by far the best one.  A mystery, a love story, a murder, and Oh SO Many Plot Twists.  If you like suspense and thrillers this is a good one.",10,1,3,26 August 2001

Psycho," A Good Thriller!
",Though this is not my favorite Hitchcock film it is close up there. I love how Hitchcock focuses on the physicological aspect of the plot and not just the blood. Hitchcock sure knows how to make a movie!!!!,9,1,3,26 August 2001
