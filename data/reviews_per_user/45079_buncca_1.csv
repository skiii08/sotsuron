Despicable Me 2," Huge disappointment
","I was so excited about this movie cause i loved first one. The story was very complex and funny, it didn't need childish Tom and Jerry jokes with minions to be funny. This movie is complete opposite of first part. Story is no better than mediocre action movie with absolutely no dynamic. Since beginning i knew whats going to happen. Also, violet zombie minions? That was the worst decision in all animated movies i have ever watched. Boy charming girl and then breaking her heart, two partners getting in love. I don't even know who approved this story. I think that 12 year old child who watched few mediocre movies could write it same. Lame movie.",1,18,34,11 August 2013
