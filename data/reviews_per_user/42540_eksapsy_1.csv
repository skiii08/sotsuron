Blade Runner 2049," It made me feel like it was a poor adaptation
","Let me clarify that I've never watched the prequel. 
Although, this movie made me feel like ... there was so much potential. I sensed that it could have been done so much better than this.The movie, well, was OK. Not something significant but not too bad either. But I felt so much that the direction and plot of this movie were so undeveloped that I had to write this review.The photographic material and the idea of the movie's scenery is absolutely stunning. But I also feel like there could have been done so much more on this aspect as well. It's like they gave a little bit of everything but nothing was special ... except the photography a great little bit.The whole experience felt emotionless and too calm. I'm not from the guys that love Action so much that want it everywhere. But this movie was just ... too desaturated. I mean ... go watch Wall-E ... it has far more emotion than this movie and the whole story is based around a Robot which can't even speak on a Dessert land with nothing around him. And the start of Wall-E was far more emotional and saturated and it was the part I loved, there wasn't any action in that! It just had emotional saturation.
 
The ending all it had me say was 'Huh, totally expected that ... So what? Where's the emotion?'. 
All I just have to say for this movie is: 
Could have been so much better, I felt so much the potential and I'm going crazy that the chance of this being something good was lost. It was just OK.",6,2,3,3 June 2018
