The Benchwarmers," The basic Sunday afternoon TV movie... for small kids... very small!
","This movie is made of direct and very basic humor, very well suited for little kids that laugh when someone slips on a banana. There are one or two gags that survive, God knows how. If one of the objectives of this movie was to reach a very diversified audience, from kids to grown-ups, it failed. In my opinion the real objective of this movie was... product placement. The big companies placed their products in a very obvious way, almost an 'in your face' exhibition of direct advertisement. What better way to sell more products to kids than in a preteen movie (in disguise).In conclusion, if you like a more intelligent kind of humor avoid this movie. It's basic. Very basic.",1,0,1,12 June 2006
