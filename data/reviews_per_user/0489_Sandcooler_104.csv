"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Irresistible underdog story
","Underdog stories usually tend to be a bit formulaic, but this movie mocks the whole underdog clich√© by just going completely over the top. Everything about this movie is retardedly implausible, and that's pretty much where all its charm seems to come from. Well, not all its charm, because Simon Pegg definitely deserves some credit as well. He does the same schtick he already did in 'Shaun Of The Dead' (even the love subplot is eerily similar), but there's nothing wrong with not changing a winning team. A good underdog movie always has you cheering for the anti-hero, and this one drags out its finale so long that the obligatory corny euphoric moment lasts for roughly twenty minutes. Just picture the decisive homerun from 'Major League' or the winning touchdown from 'Remember the Titans', this movie's entire third act feels like that. Not the definitive sports comedy, but undoubtebly one of the funniest.",8,0,1,1 June 2012
The Devil's Advocate," Running with the devil
","This movie has a very original plot, and it also contains enough layers to stay interesting throughout. The many story developments keep it moving at a good pace, and at times the director really pulls of some really great things. The confrontation at the end is just an instant classic scene, amazing in every way. And I might be kicking in an open door here, but Al Pacino is a very good actor. His portrayal of Milton/Satan is perfect, he's threatening and dark but you can still buy that people trust him, it's a subtle performance that makes this movie. However, part of this story seems a bit contrived. Why are these protagonists so extremely excited about moving to New York? They nearly faint when they see their new apartment, I'm having a difficult time believing a Florida lawyer winning 64 times in a row has is that bad back home. The ending is also let's say, an acquired taste. I personally am not really that into it. Nonetheless, this is an excellent, delightfully dark occult thriller.",9,2,2,4 June 2009
The Blair Witch Project," Work of genius
","In one way this is a bunch of people filming random trees with a video camera, in another it's one of the creepiest movies ever made. Most of the time you don't know what's happening, and that's its major strength. The mystery in this movie gets unbearable once you're into it, and for the most part you don't get any wiser as the time progresses, just more intrigued. You know it's not going to end well, but how will it end? What is all this footage leading up to? People walking around in the woods has never been this fascinating, and probably never will be again. And then you finally get the ending, and it pisses some people of, but to me it is extremely fitting. What was the audience really expecting, I wonder. It's a brilliant ending, and this is a brilliant movie.",10,2,4,1 November 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The pictures, they come to life
","While relying on and 'lending' from his vast collection of samurai movies, Tarantino may just have made the ultimate revenge flick. It's almost five hours long, but it still feels as if it flashes by. The fight scenes in this movie are downright unbelievable, great choreography and exillerating cartoon gore. The omnipresent music just tops them of, some brilliant musical choices there. Tarantino's touch is unmistakable, especially the Pai Mei sequences have his name written all over them. The Five Pointed Palm Exploding Heart Technique, the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, he sure had his fun with this project. Some people didn't like the final showdown, and it wasn't what I had expected either, but it's still a great conclusion. To me it was the perfect way to end the story, a climax rather than an anti-climax. 'Kill Bill' is a wonderous journey through the samurai genre.",10,0,1,3 March 2010
Lucky Number Slevin," Smooth
","Yet another one of those hypercool crime movies, this one's variation is that it actually has a good plot, apart from something happens somewhere and then all the story lines intertwine. They still decided to keep the whole talking in one-liners thing though, and it's not working out here. Neither does the obligatory pseudo-philosophy. I can't say it's all that poorly written, but it just seems really out of place for some reason. Perhaps I'm just sick of directors trying to be Tarantino and having people talk in a way nobody talks. Then again, it could be the unconvincing delivery, Josh Hartnett is no well, he's not much of anyone. When Morgan Freeman gets his podium for a pointless monologue, it just sucks less. No need to be negative though, this movie is still quite good. The pace is pretty smooth, for once I even enjoyed the camera going everywhere because it fit the atmosphere. And as I said, the plot is really good and not that easy to figure out, which surprised me. It's one of the better attempts.",8,2,6,7 December 2008
The Equalizer," Brutally violent, yet still atmospheric
","The revenge flick is one of those subgenres Hollywood never seems to get tired of. The main reason for that is that they just look so damn easy to write: just get a gang of evil stereotypes harming someone innocent and then turn the tables, you're done. It seems like the formula really does everything for you, it just comes down to coming up with action scenes until you can finally kill of the main villain. 'The Equalizer' however is a movie that shows us how much you can do with the genre if your screenwriter's not phoning it in. For example, most revenge movies make the error of barely establishing the victim, making it difficult to care when the baddies get their comeuppance. In this one Chloe Grace Moretz doesn't get much screen time, but it's not necessary: it just takes about two scenes to start caring about her character. In fact, everything about this movie seems compact yet efficient. There isn't a single scene that goes on for too long, nor is there a single boring moment. While most action movies just throw everything they have at you and see what sticks, 'The Equalizer' is just a perfect puzzle: the pacing, the visual style, the almost cartoonish violence, the brilliant performance by Denzel Washington (who switches back and forth between loving friend and cruel angel of vengeance with baffling ease), everything just clicks together. 'The Equalizer' is nothing you haven't seen before, but you've rarely seen it done this competently.",9,0,6,9 February 2015
The Expendables 2," Same as the first (and what's the problem with that?)
","To some fans 'The Expendables 2' has everything that they couldn't quite find in the original, but given that I already liked the original I can't fully agree with this. Some new names were added to the cast, but apart from that it's the same old thing we got to know and love when all these guys were doing it in the 80s. The villain in this movie is called Jean Villain (it's Jean-Claude Van Damme! Yay!), that should probably give you an idea of how serious all these guys are taking it. Van Damme plays him extremely well by the way, he looks just as evil as Eric Roberts did in the first one but to top that of he can actually move. His best scene is his introduction though, where he gets to kill the most obvious cannon fodder character in the history of cinema. The good guys have some fresh faces (I use that term really loosely), the cast is actually getting so crowded now Jet Li has to parachute himself out of this movie early on. If only he had a parachute for Randy Couture, who is always around but still has about two lines in the entire movie. The action scenes (and the movie's nothing but) are pretty much what you can expect from Simon 'Con Air' West, you'll be cheering in the audience right until the end or until you're ushered out. The helicopter scene is just awesome in so many ways. 'Expendables 2' makes you hungry for 'Expendables 3', and that seems to be what they were going for.",6,2,3,17 December 2012
Spartacus," Historically inaccurate, but just so darn entertaining
","This movie does some weird stuff to the Roman time line (the special appearance by the by that time long-dead Gracchus comes to mind), but that's not really the point of the whole thing. It just wants to show you a beautiful spectacle, and it really delivers. From the first minute in this movie is incredibly compelling, mainly because of the portrayal of Spartacus, which strikes exactly the right tone. Kirk Douglas gives him a lot of different aspects, a lot of good and bad points, which really helps showing of his human side. Kubrick directed, but he never really manages to put his own identity into the movie. However he does manage to create some really marvellous battle scenes, which I guess is the next best thing. This movie isn't better or worse than his later works, it's just really, really different from them. Overall I really enjoyed this movie, totally worth the three hours.",9,1,3,25 January 2010
Gravity," Fantastic visuals, stilted writing
","'Gravity' is worth your money just for the opening scene. In a world where movies are plagued by directors/producers who think any shot longer than .5 seconds is dreadfully boring (yes you, Michael Bay), keeping the camera perfectly steady for at least two minutes is an amazingly daring approach that turned out to be a brilliant fetch. It immediately captures your attention by doing everything Hollywood hates (that's ironic, but not very), it's a magnificent opening. There are more breath-taking scenes spread throughout the movie, visually it's an amazing experience and it actually shows us that movies like these can be made for other reasons than just to show of new technologies. The technical side is amazing, but it's also functional, and that's something a lot of movies seem to forget. In the second half however, this movie's flaws really come into play. The screenplay is just really mediocre, when you take away how fantastic the movie looks it's really just a basic tearjerker with an absolutely terrible ending. The character development doesn't flow at all, it's just thrown into there as forcibly as possible as they kinda hope nobody notices. What's the significance of Bullock's character losing her child anyway? Isn't being lost in space with no oxygen enough drama to keep the plot going? I stared in awe at the first half, but the second half just doesn't add up. Movie of the year? Visually yes, but I don't know if that's enough.",7,2,4,7 November 2013
Inglourious Basterds," Brilliantly offbeat wartime western
","Wow. It's been a while since I left a movie theatre so overwhelmed. From the first minute to the last this movie is shocking, amusing and horrendously entertaining all at the same time. The prologue is vintage Tarantino. The way the tension is build up throughout that opening scene is truly magnificent, and the camera pans down just at the right time. And by that time you've already learned to absolutely despise Landa, probably the most disgusting character Tarantino ever came up with. He's truly a man you love to hate, and his charming persona just makes him seem even more evil. He's if possible even more threatening than Jules Winfield was in the infamous breakfast scene from 'Pulp Fiction'. The segments with the basterds are probably the ones Tarantino had the most fun with, and these segments really know no boundaries in any way. Not only are they hilariously violent (the baseball bat!), they also ignore every possible historic fact. I wouldn't really want it any other way really. Another highlight is the bar scene, which illustrates perfectly how unpredictable this movie is. There are too many good moments to be naming them all, but this movie benefits so much from its outrageousness you really need to see everything for yourself.",10,32,65,20 September 2009
Kickboxer," Pretty straight-forward revenge flick
","If you liked 'Bloodsport', you'll like this one, because it's pretty much the same movie. Van Damme's out for revenge again, this time on some Thai dude who put his brother in a wheelchair. So he trains. And trains. And trains. A huge chunk of this movie is devoted to Van Damme kicking air or if we're lucky inanimate objects. Some of that stuff is actually pretty badass, like the scene where the usual wise trainer stereotype instructs him to take down a tree, but most of it just feels boring and overlong. The romantic subplot isn't any help either, around halfway I was just hoping they would bring out the fight already. So then they bring out the fight and it's actually quite good, well-choreographed and the climax is set up nicely. Only problem I'm having with the conclusion is that they shouldn't have made the villain talk. Or at least come up with something better for him to say. This movie is excellent within its genre, but obviously it's also very predictable.",7,0,1,5 September 2009
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Not what I expected, but it has its moments
","Maybe I just get too demanding when it comes to Judd Apatow productions, but 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is well, forgettable. It's not any worse than the average romantic comedy, but it's not much better either. Ten minutes in you know how the movie will end, which is bothersome because you expect Apatow's team to reinvent this genre at least a tiny bit. But nope, they just follow the same old tired formula everyone else uses. The comedy is pretty decent, but not perfect either. Jason Segel is fantastic in the lead and does great with the material he's got, but the supposedly hilarious secondary characters never really take off. Russell Brand is only funny for the first two scenes, then you've seen it. Jonah Hill is better, but there you have the opposite problem: he's underused. This movie just can't give you a break. The full frontal male nudity is also sort of a desperate attempt to be edgy, a really uninspired attempt to distinguish itself. I didn't hate 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall', but it's no well, anything else Apatow has produced.",6,1,3,25 December 2012
The Hunger Games," 'Battle Royale' without the stinger
","'The Hunger Games' was an instant hit when it came out, so I'm pretty sure I'm the last person in this universe to see it. Unfortunately, it sorta felt like I was wasting my time. The movie seemed like equal parts 'Running Man', 'The Truman Show' and 'Battle Royale', but with all the clever elements from either of those movies removed. I don't get a kick out of gratuitous violence or something, but spending the first hour on build-up that will barely have any effect on the plot is looooooooong. Take for example all the scenes where they have to impress possible sponsors (to provide outside help) with their fighting skill, sponsoring comes into play so rarely later on that all those scenes are completely cuttable. During the actual hunger game/battle royale, you still don't get much of an action or adventure movie. They're after pulling heart strings mostly, including the incredibly stretched-out death scene of a character we literally know NOTHING about (a full action-free hour wasn't enough to establish some traits?). The most bothersome thing about the movie though it how freaking convenient everything is. Our main cardboard cutouts (granted, Jennifer Lawrence does the best she can with the material) are up against highly trained manhunters, heavily bleeding and leaving traces all over the forest. How do they not die on the first day? How does nobody spot them when they stand there crying and screaming in a wide-open space? Some other character lights a small fire and is killed within about three seconds, but I guess you can't act stupid if you're not important to the plot. The main characters don't survive because they're so strong, so creative, so quick or so fearless: they survive because the script says so. Therefor there's barely any tension, you can predict everything beat for beat. Given its massive success this movie's got to have lots of appeal, but it must have missed me by a mile.",5,28,38,13 July 2014
The 13th Warrior," Decent medieval brawl
","Antonio Banderas plays an Arab in this movie, which isn't nearly as weird as I expected it to be. It's kind of a stretch to see him call one of his companions 'a pig-eating son of a whore', but even that was sorta believable. As for the rest of the film, it's good without really being anything special. A bunch of angry Vikings try to defend their town, and figure the best way to do that is to get some help from Antonio Banderas. The battles look really nice, they're filled with an epic atmosphere and heroic imagery. Since most of the movie is made up from battles, it's pretty entertaining. One does wonder if it was really worth the massive budget (around 100 million, apparently) though, because it's not exactly film history that's written here. In fact, it's not even close to being the best movie in its genre. Still liked it though.",8,2,5,17 August 2010
Shaun of the Dead," Near-perfect homage
","This is often marketed as a parody to Romero's 'Dawn Of The Dead', but it's so much more than that. The clever writing makes this a movie with many layers. First of all, it's of course a brilliant pile-up of genre clich√©s and nods to the source material. It's been three days since I watched this movie and I'm still unbelievably amused by 'We're coming to get you, Barbara'. Then, it's a straight-forward laugh-out-loud comedy. My favourite moment in the entire movie is when they try to kill a couple of zombies by throwing LP's through their faces. That scene was already in the theatre trailer, so I must have seen it countless times by now, but it still gets me every time. Surprisingly, this movie also has some good straight-up horror value. I really didn't expect this to be so gory, the cartoon violence is definitely a plus and fits right in. I also liked how I actually cared about which characters lived and which characters died for a change. That's pretty rare in recent horror efforts, so it was unexpected to find this quality in of all things, 'Shaun Of The Dead'. Long story short: 'Shaun Of The Dead' is effing awesome.",9,2,5,14 January 2010
Rocky V," Rocky takes the Mickey role
","This part of the 'Rocky'-series tries to go back to basics, and hell it almost works. They even rehired original director John G. Avildsen, A for effort. However, some things just kinda bring this movie down. First of all, you have the fact that Avildsen isn't really that great. The entries that Stallone directed had just as much visual flair (if not more), so what's really the point of hiring an outside guy again? Furthermore, the plot to this movie seems crummy. Rocky suddenly just loses all his money, when what now? Yeah yeah Paulie accidentally signed something yadda yadda yadda more vague movie reasons, on with the show. Back to his old neighbourhood he goes, whatever works. Then you have the new characters, who are just really bland. Tommy Gunn is by far the most boring boxer in the entire franchise, and Duke (not the same 'Duke' from the previous ones mind you, was it really that hard to come up with some different name?) is such a cardboard villain you think you're watching a kid's movie. However, this shouldn't suggest there's nothing good about this movie. The bits with Rocky's son actually work well this time around, even though Sage Stallone can't really act. I'm also quite glad Talia Shire finally gets something to do besides looking worried for 90 minutes. Here it's just 80 minutes of looking worried and some good emotional speeches. 'Rocky V' will probably always be the black sheep of the family, but it still has its merits.",6,4,4,11 March 2011
The Rocker," Heart-warming at first, quickly loses steam
","The first fifteen minutes of this movie is great, it's filled with beautiful, melancholic scenes. A washed-up musician trying to go for one last moment of fame, that's a story you can get into, and Rainn Wilson plays his role in a fairly convincing way. Sadly, what follows is rather lame and different from what I expected. There's very little actual humor in this movie, the characters are totally one-dimensional (meet alternative teenage girl #9542) and the whole thing is constantly swimming dangerously close to the dreaded Disney Channel territory. Just check out the music itself, it almost sounds like the Jonas Brothers' lost tapes. Tough to imagine an aspiring metal artist would want to be in a 1000-mile radius of this band, but that's just one of the many weird things we just have to suck up. And of course there are also subplots about love interests, there's just no possible way to avoid that in this kind of movie. They slow the movie down more than anything, which makes it rather boring to boot. This movie is very similar to 'School of Rock', but somehow it's also lots worse.",5,2,5,16 July 2011
Ted," Great bathroom humor with some unexpected extras
","The most surprising thing about 'Ted' is that it features an actual story rather than dragging itself from one joke to the next. It's a simple story, but it definitely has some degree of fairytale magic and leads to some genuinely touching scenes in the third act. That's something you don't really expect from Seth MacFarlane, because storytelling isn't exactly his strongest point. I was expecting this to be just as filled with non-sequiturs as 'Family Guy', and I would have been fine with that. But all of a sudden MacFarlane understands how to write interesting characters you can side with, and that's a nice plus. The most important thing is the humor though, and 'Ted' has plenty of laughs. The voice acting is kinda lazy because Ted sounds exactly like Peter Griffin, but the screenplay is good enough to make you forget about that. Not bad for a debut film.",8,1,1,8 July 2015
Coffee and Cigarettes," Flat
","This movie starts out promising with a piece of absurd comedy that actually works. Though you really can't do anything wrong when Steven Wright is in your scene, I had high hopes. I mean you have everything, a good setting, bizarre dialogues and the complimentary clever twist. However, the movie pretty much goes downhill from that scene on. Jim Jarmusch tried to make art people would speak of in every lounge bar from Europe to Eastern Europe but he just comes of as lazy. He had an insane amount of time to figure how he would bring it, and then he comes up with this. It doesn't even seem like he did any writing or anything, all he did was set up the camera and hope Iggy Pop and Tom Waits would say cool lines because they're Iggy Pop and Tom Waits. Most of the material carries that bothersome 'almost funny'-label. Steve Buscemi's theory on Elvis and his twin brother is almost funny, but then again no. Teaming up a near-insane Bill Murray with guys from the Wu-Tang Clan, well that was funny. Both The White Stripes and Alfred Molina have a pretty good segment too but all in all I just felt bored with the whole thing. I like the idea, but some good writing wouldn't have hurt.",6,2,2,6 October 2008
The Great Dictator," Hitler gets burned, so to speak
","This satire is just really, really dead-on, and nobody is spared. But even though this movie has plenty of laughs within the silly story and the grotesque imitation of Hitler (here cleverly renamed as 'Hynkel', and speaking in a hilarious kind of pseudo-German), the general tone is pretty sad, maybe because of the movie's place in history. And the actors aren't even exaggerating that much I suppose. One of the greatest movie moments of all time must be the Jewish barber's ending speech, if only things could have ended in that way. It's not even really the character talking anymore, it's Chaplin saying something he really wanted to say. If you ignore the technical aspects, the movie doesn't feel dated or old, it actually moves at a pretty nice pace. And the sharp humor we find everywhere in this work will never die, the only thing I don't care for is the slapstick, but that just comes with the era I suppose. This is an incredibly daring, harsh take on fascism, it's so hard-hitting still after all these years.",9,4,6,22 February 2009
Home Alone," Hell yeah
","You get a lot of kids these days fast-forwarding until they see somebody get hurt. I don't know, perhaps they should. That last half hour is one of the coolest bunch of movie sequences ever thrown together. It's all childish as hell but I can't not laugh at the villains walking into a bunch of really obvious traps. The redundant sequels tried to get the same kind of flow between all the physical gags but I think it's safe to say they just sucked. You can't touch the grand finale of 'Home Alone'. However, I think what comes before all of that is pretty enjoyable too, or at least I used to as a kid. Being home alone, able to do whatever you want, it's not too bad of a Christmas present. It gets boring because the set-up takes a bit too long, but I understand they had to have an excuse for that brilliant main event. I'm usually not that excited about a movie aimed towards children, but 'Home Alone' is just really really cool.",9,0,1,29 December 2008
Juno," Every good thing you've heard and more
","'Juno' is an incredibly cute movie, and for once I don't even mean that in a patronising sense. If the movie universe was some sort of gigantic petting zoo, 'Juno' would be the adorable little lamb standing in the corner making the jealous other lambs look like death incarnate. It's not a sugary sweet tale by any means, in fact it's a real down to earth kind of story that's not always pretty, but the approach to it couldn't be more right. It's humble, it's little, it's low-budget, and that's exactly what makes it so great. What I also liked about it, hell what I like about a lot of independent movies, is that it's never predictable. There is no formula, you don't know what's coming, you don't sit there quietly ticking of all the clich√©s: you just enjoy yourself tremendously. Finally, one last addition to the heap of praise and I swear I'll stop: it's been ages since I've seen an ending scene this beautiful. It's exactly the way you want it to be, and the camera zooming out at a barely noticeable speed is a brilliant touch. I quite liked 'Juno'.",9,25,37,20 September 2011
L.A. Confidential," Murder and intrigue, 50s style
","This is one of those movies that has you hooked from the first minute to the last, there's never a dull moment in sight. The characters all work well together, and the whole friends become enemies and enemies become friends theme the entire movie is based on is extremely well-written. I really liked the many different twists, they were high in number but they never felt forced, and the movie's inner logic was never disturbed by any of them. If anything, each turn in the story makes the plot seem more coherent. The incredible amount of action scenes and general mayhem also makes this whole thing move at a breakneck pace, and the violence is just really overwhelming. Every scene is well-directed, but to me the violent scenes really stand out as being amazingly brutal. This is one of the greatest movies the 90s have to offer.",9,1,2,15 December 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," All of Hollywood's wrongs and even some new
","The worst feeling I had while watching this was that I predicted a joke, they did the joke, and the entire audience was nearly pissing themselves laughing. For the rest well, something explodes, there's stuff coming out of it that explodes, and then it falls apart in things that explode. And I thought Hollywood was out of ideas, while they're even out of the basic elements of ideas. The scene is which we see thirty Jack Sparrows talking to each other is well-made but dull as vanilla anyway. I'll skip through more than two hours of characters trying to build some kind of story (something with a treasure chest and other things made up by giving someone a blindfold and a dictionary) and just go to the final fight, which is pretty good actually. I had no idea who was who, but at least it looked cool. Couldn't hold a candle to the first one.",4,1,2,26 May 2007
Yes Man," Jim Carrey's roots
","There are always two things going through my head when I watch movies like 'The Truman Show' or 'Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind'. The first thing is that Jim Carrey is truly a tremendous actor that could do well in a wide variety of genres. The second thing is: 'I'm sad, I'm going to watch an Ace Ventura movie'. What I'm trying to say is that he's really versatile, and 'Yes Man' definitely caters to the classic Carrey fans. He's everything you expect him to be in this one: he's unbelievably energetic, he's loud, he's wild, and he cracks you up every five seconds or so. In one scene they just make him drink Red Bull and the rest sorta writes itself, it's all as vintage Carrey as can be. Rich man's Katy Perry Zooey Deschanel is also really good in this movie, because at least she manages to rise above being the lame, bland love interest you usually have to put up with in this sort of movie. She actually has a personality, what more could you want? Caring for the obligatory love subplot in a blockbuster comedy has never been closer to possible than in this movie. 'Yes Man' is just an hilarious comedy, totally worth seeing.",8,1,1,2 October 2011
The Adventures of Tintin," Pedestrian adventure film, but at least it has Tintin
","Some have described this movie as 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark' with Tintin, but to me it doesn't really have the charm of something like the Indiana Jones movies. I don't know precisely what it is, maybe I just need my explosions to be in live action for them to work. The animation techniques used in this film are absolutely excellent, but when your writing is this mediocre the whole motion capture thing seems like nothing more than a gimmick. Speaking of useless gimmicks, what is up with the 3D-effects in this movie? Or rather, where are they? When you're forcing yourself to pay extra and watch an entire movie wearing those glasses nobody likes, you at least demand that there will be some things flying into your face. Forget it, unless you count subtitles. It's not all bad though. The actors for instance are very good, particularly Andy Serkis as Haddock. The movie also manages to strike the exact tone the comic books had, it's pretty faithful to the original and you can tell the makers love the source material. Furthermore, it can also be very witty sometimes, which is something you may not expect. Overall it's pretty entertaining and I had fun, 'Tintin' is a decent popcorn flick without being anything special.",7,0,5,25 November 2011
Snatch," Another dose of Diet Tarantino
","'Snatch' is really just the same as 'Lock,Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', only here, the clever dialogues are replaced by f-words. If I want to hear the f-word 153 times, I'll just call a Detroit tech support. So once again, a bunch of criminals get themselves into the most standard situations available, like being in debt with Harry the Hatchet uhm, Brick Top, stealing diamonds (where would he get that from?), betting on illegal boxing matches etc. It's pretty obvious the only crime Guy Ritchie has ever witnessed is when Madonna gets her pay. Obviously, everybody needs nicknames again, Boris the Blade (he has nothing to do with blades but hey, it's an alliteration), Frankie Four Fingers, Doug The Head, you get how it works by now. Obviously the movie is still quite good because it's so like Tarantino that you can't help enjoying yourself and I suppose it's Guy Ritchie's specialty (I'm not saying it's great, I'm saying I've seen 'Swept Away'). But to put this with the 250 best of all time, let's get real.",7,1,2,10 February 2007
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Lost some relevance, but it holds up
","This movie used to be one of the most caustic satires ever captured on celluloid, which kinda shows how far the limits have moved since the 60s. Don't get me wrong, I do of course understand people took offense to this. Mocking nuclear warfare in the middle of the Cold War is daring no matter how you look at it, and furthermore it creates a thoroughly bitter-sweet atmosphere only paralleled in Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator'. But when it comes to the actual execution of the idea, the whole thing is sorta goodie two shoes by today's standards. Only Peter Sellers really manages to get in your face from time to time, and that's mainly because most of his material is improvised. The actual script seems pretty well thought-out and balanced, but the dialogues often just lack zest. Occasionally there's a decent one-liner in there ('There will be no fighting in the war room!'), but often the scenes just serve purely as exposition and go on way longer than they need to. Still, the movie seems to pick up steam around halfway and leads you to an absolutely hysterical ending that makes it all worth it. Not Kubrick's best, but far from bad.",6,1,4,13 July 2012
The Expendables," Exactly what you would expect
","In a way this throwback to old school action movies is very refreshing. In a world where pretty much every aging star tries to reinvent himself to stay relevant, Stallone really seems to make a statement by staying exactly the same. Sure, by now his genre is pretty much dead and buried because of newer, smarter and more modern action flicks, but one can hardly deny 'The Expendables' is still incredibly entertaining. The movie almost feels like a really long trailer, it's pretty much nothing but explosions, cheesy one-liners and tough guys being tough and acting as wooden as humanly possible. The movie's mainly a homage to this kind of shoot-em-up flicks, and you can tell these makers are really fond of what they're doing. Occasionally the tongue-in-cheek feel is a bit overdone (the cameos by Ah-nuld and Bruce Willis seem stilted and pointless), but overall this touch is very welcome. The ridiculously (and I mean ridiculously) happy ending is just icing on the cake. It takes some very clever people to make something this dumb.",8,3,7,21 December 2010
Scary Movie 2," Way too rushed
","Given that 'Scary Movie' was a huge hit, I can understand the studio wanted to strike while the iron was hot. This sequel came out less than a year after the original, they really wanted to make sure the audience hadn't forgotten the first one yet. Sadly, the time pressure is very apparent. This whole movie just seems very unfinished, lots of scenes look like blueprints of something that could potentially be funny. Take the scenes with the handicapped character for instance, those had so much more potential than they actually showed. Other scenes however are just plain lazy and repetitive. Yeah, Shorty still smokes weed, the gay guy is still gay, Cindy is still ditzy and Brenda is still loud. Nothing new or creative is done with any of these characteristics, the actors just routinely reprise their stereotypes wondering when they're finally going to get a funny line. At 83 minutes, this movie is really quite short, but it's still packed with needless filler material and jokes that just appear to be rejected material from the first one. Very disappointing flick.",3,3,6,16 February 2011
Taxi Driver," Fantastic character study with a brilliant ending
","'Taxi Driver' is a movie that thrives on the fact that anything Travis Bickle does is incredibly interesting. There's not much to the first hour, he just hangs around his apartment and occasionally drives a taxi. And yet, it's incredibly fascinating because there's so much suppressed rage in the character. You don't know what to think of him, but somehow you do know it can't go well for very long. When everything goes to hell you get a fantastic and pretty unpredictable ending, but it's the suspenseful build-up that really makes this movie a classic. Bickle is slowly driven to the edge by this filthy town full of whores, robbers, killers and Harvey Keitel with a stupid hat. You never know how he's going to react to a certain situation, which makes the violent outbursts very effective. In 'Taxi Driver' Scorsese has very much the same style he was developing in 'Mean Streets', but it seems like he has a lot more to say here. A truly unique movie by a director at the top of his league.",10,1,3,16 May 2015
Shutter Island," Less impressive than expected
","This suspense thriller relies mostly on a number of clever plot twists, which to me is also its Achilles heel. Throughout the entire movie, I had the annoying feeling that it was always rather obvious what was going to happen. The script isn't quite as mysterious or complex as the makers assumed it was, it's not particularly difficult to figure things out. All other aspects of the movie are nothing short of brilliant though. DiCaprio and Ben Kingsley are both perfect for their roles, the scenes they share are the highlights of the movie. The style of the film is also very well-crafted, the images are beautifully gripping. Still, none of that quite holds up when the key twist is rather predictable.",7,2,4,7 December 2010
Barry Lyndon," Majestuous, epic, fully Kubrickian
","'Barry Lyndon' isn't as much a film as it is visual poetry. Generally I don't enjoy a 'style over substance' approach to filmmaking, but 'Barry Lyndon' is a movie that really shows what a genius Stanley Kubrick was. William Makepeace Thackeray's novel really isn't that fantastic, to me by far the weakest story Kubrick has ever adapted. But the imagery he gets out of it, all the shots that look like Renaissance paintings, the utter coldness (nobody has emotions until the last hour) with which he tells the story makes this a true classic. And then there's the other Kubrick trademark I adore: keeping the pace as low as possible without ever getting boring. The duels for instance take ages, but that's mainly because we're dealing with someone who knows what suspense is. Who minds that it takes the duelists roughly half an hour to cock a pistol, Kubrick knows he can take as long as he likes because you always want to know what happens next. The only thing that's kind of shame is that the studio forced him to hire Ryan O'Neal, who is wrong for the character and robs the movie of some of its incredible charm. If this had a better lead, it may have been the best film (Kubrick has) ever made.",9,2,3,16 April 2014
Full Metal Jacket," Near-perfect cinema
","Behold: the greatest villain in movie history. Okay, this may not actually be true. Hartman's probably not an actual villain, just a man who means well but takes it a bit too far. But damn it, he's such a guy you love to hate. It's the sort of character you can despise while the back of your brain wants to be him. There's no such thing as perfection, but R.Lee Ermey's memorable performance comes dangerously close at times. Some have stated that this movie plays all its cards in the first half and then just drags itself to the credits, but I can't agree, even though I can perfectly understand this opinion. It's true that the second half of the movie isn't as hard and direct as the first half, but that's exactly the thing: it crawls up on you. The first half is great while you're watching it, what follows is at times more brilliant when you give it thought afterwards. Also, that ending is downright beautiful. The ending monologue is delivered with such a saddening monotony that it brings over the horrors of war better than any amount of battlefield action scenes ever could. Wonderful movie.",9,0,0,29 August 2010
Rocky II," Pedestrian sequel
","When you put in a 'Rocky'-movie, you always expect it to be corny to some extent. Hell what am I saying, you demand it to be corny to some extent. This first sequel however, it goes a bit overboard. The hospital scene where Adrian wakes up from a coma and goes 'Win!Win!' might be the most embarrassing moment of the entire franchise, and keep in mind 'Rocky V' exists. That's not really the biggest problem though, what bothers me more is that this one just so soullessly copies the original. I know all these sequels have the same premise, but most of them at least get different locations, opponents or other awesome new elements. This one has Rocky fighting Apollo Creed again, right after a training montage that you could pass of as stock footage from the first one. Why still the relatively high rating then? I don't really have an answer to that, apart from that it's 'Rocky' damn it.",6,1,2,19 February 2011
Corpse Bride," Eerily beautiful, but not quite perfect
","'Corpse Bride' is the kind of movie that makes me proud that I've never gotten too old for fairy tales. And as long as Tim Burton manages to keep his head in the clouds, I doubt I ever will. This movie is so soothing, so heart-warming, but at the same time it's also very dark. Take that literally in fact, black is the primary color. The animation is absolutely wonderful, but the movie never tries to sell that as an achievement of its own. Mastering the effects is only useful when you combine it with good writing, and Tim Burton seems to be one of the few great directors that actually seems to remember this. What a beautiful story this is, in some ways 'Corpse Bride' is the kind of movie Disney keeps failing to make. Purely for the sake of nitpicking however, I would like to point that a) the movie seems really short to me (not even 80 minutes) and b) the ending is somewhat disappointing. Apart from that, this thing is pure magic.",8,0,0,30 October 2011
Forrest Gump," Magnificent
","To say it with a clich√©: they don't make 'em like this anymore. 'Forrest Gump' is pretty much everything that was great about 90s cinema and more. It's incredibly long, but it isn't boring for a second. The dialogues are all things at once, one moment they're fast-paced and hilarious and two seconds later they're slow and horrendously saddening. The way the plot develops is truly beautiful, because Forrest Gump is one of the greatest underdogs I've ever seen in a movie. You can't help but feel happy whenever he accidentally writes world history, or just when he misunderstands things yet again and shows his butt to the president. Everything just feels right in this movie, the script doesn't have a word too few or too many. If you haven't noticed, to me this is one of the best movies ever made.",10,1,1,18 November 2010
Notting Hill," Somewhat touching Hugh Grant flick
","This movie basically just connects the dots between all the romantic comedy clich√©s, but at least it does so competently. The standard boy-meets-girl thing is as formulaic as ever, but this time around the actors make it work really well. I also like how the obligatory comic relief character is actually funny here, that's a luxury the average Hugh Grant film rarely has. Hail Spike and all his disgusting ways. Obviously the script is very predictable, and there are some scenes in here that are downright painfully corny ('I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy' definitely comes to mind), but if you have to watch one thing that features Hugh Grant, there are plenty of worse picks that this.",7,2,4,13 January 2011
Nightcrawler," Sick, cruel and disgusting, but somehow the best film of 2014
","Jake Gyllenhaal is not getting an Academy Award for this role, but he damn well should. This is one of the most amazing performances I have ever seen in a movie, I've never seen a character be so uneasy and so disturbingly entertaining at the same time. It's that empty gaze that does it, you keep wondering about the morality of a character that spends his time filming traffic/murder victims in their dying moments just so he can sell it to the news. We know he's doing terrible things, but does he? We understand that he treats everyone around him like garbage, but it seems like he genuinely doesn't. This powerful effect is very much helped by the absence of police interference until well into the third act. It really brings home the point that everyone's okay with Louis' wrongdoings, they even applaud them. Is Louis evil, or just a guy who really likes to follow and cash in on society's (disturbing) trends? The whole ending is just really awful (in a good way), but it's just based on Louis thinking he has a business to run. No lust for blood, no kick out of violence, it's just like he says: he's just doing his job. That whole concept is endlessly fascinating to me, and while I rarely speak for others: I'm sure it will be to you. This is one of the few movies that I just can't imagine anyone could hate. Best movie of the year for me.",9,1,4,25 November 2014
American Pie," Coming to age
","This movie revived the whole raunchy comedy genre, but really it isn't all about bodily fluids. Its many knock-offs never seemed to get this, but the sex jokes weren't the core of this movie. Sure, it's funny when some dude gets caught getting it on with a pie, but that wasn't really the point. The way I see it, it was really about a bunch of guys trying to cope with growing up. Jason Biggs and Eugene Levy master in awkward situations, but their scenes are also incredibly heart-warming, especially the one with the nudie magazines. My absolute favourite part though (apart from the inevitable Nadia scene) comes near the ending, when Jim finally manages to put everything into perspective and tells everyone of. Such a brilliant scene, or maybe I'm just getting soft. This movie has been called the 'Porky's' of its generation, and really I couldn't have said it better myself.",9,0,0,2 March 2010
The Last Legion," Not great, but it's all in good fun
","There are some precautions you have to take when you plan on watching this movie. Firstly, you have to accept that you will learn absolutely nothing about history. This movie is meant to be about as educational as a monster truck show, so no need to complain about the various preposterous inaccuracies. The makers obviously didn't care about facts, neither should you. Secondly, you have to buy that the fierce Roman commander in this movie is played by (of all people) Colin Firth. Nothing against Colin Firth, but no matter for how long he grows his beard, he'll just never look tough. Hell, even the kid he's protecting seems like he could totally take him out. Thirdly, the performance by Ben Kingsley is really hammy, which is funny at first but then really just starts insulting your intelligence. If you can deal with all that, you have yourself a pretty decent off-brand 'Spartacus'. If not well, I guess you have more taste than I do.",5,1,2,9 July 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Just can't get into it
","At last. I've finally gotten through 'Lord Of The Rings', presumably as the last person in the world to do so. I've started watching it numerous times though, but somehow my head just kept tuning out. The story probably isn't the problem: it's about as classic as a story structure can get (protagonist-goal-antagonist), the world they live in might be complex but overall the movie is hardly difficult to follow. The cast is great as well, pretty much everybody's a perfect fit. What can you really do wrong when you get Christopher Lee? But still, I just don't find the movie compelling. The plot moves along so slow in this one, it's three hours long but as the credits roll it still feels like the trilogy has barely begun. There are some amazing special effects thrown around as well, but I'm not going to love a movie because it's incredibly difficult to make. I love movies because they're entertaining, and frankly this first part of the trilogy often just bored me. I guess it's an acquired taste I just can't seem to acquire.",5,2,3,13 October 2012
The Shining," 'Heeeeere's Johnny!' (and then some)
","As much as I love Stephen King, his novel 'The Shining' just never really did anything for me. And as much as I love Kubrick, he can't really get me into it either. I mean, of course 'The Shining' is a good movie. The cinematography is breath-taking (just check out the marvelous opening credit sequence), the acting is great and the multi-layeredness of the screenplay is perfect. But alas, it just doesn't move me. The elevator doors opening, the identical twins, the 'REDRUM' scenes, I just don't find them as creepy as I should. That's kind of a problem, because the actual plot moves quite slow. Once Jack Nicholson (here cleverly named 'Jack') finally turns crazy he sure as hell delivers, but it takes him a while to get there. The last half hour of this movie is the part most people remember, before that a lot of the scenes seem too stretched out and in some cases just plain redundant. 'The Shining' is a classic, just not one I'm particularly fond of.",7,0,0,11 July 2011
American Beauty," Easily one of the best movies ever made
","Confronting, bitter-sweet but nevertheless hilarious, that about sums it up. Lester's midlife crisis gets more painful by the minute, but he is in fact one of the most wonderful anti-heroes I've ever seen. He's the typical guy that can't catch a break, which makes it incredibly fulfilling to me when he actually manages to tell some people of. He's always wished things would have turned out better for him, but they didn't so he works out and buys a sports car. But in the end, he can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of his stupid little life. If that's not beautiful, I really don't know what is. The side characters are all so well-written, so fitting. I particularly like the actress playing Ricky's mom, a character that's just kinda waiting until she can finally die. The climax of the movie featuring Ricky's dad is also a great example of a thorough character study. Not to mention that it's just really funny in a weird way. I could go on and on, but I probably wouldn't end up saying anything no one else has said before. Incredible movie.",10,0,1,13 June 2010
Wanted," It's actually awesome
","I've never really liked theatre runs of loud, expensive action movies but I'm willing to make an exception for this one. Perhaps because it's so loud and fast and flashy and actually ends up leaving an impression on me rather than just staying on the screen and fading out like so many others. James MacAvoy gives his best shot at playing a total loser that in a lengthy fish out of water sequence is beaten up, stabbed and such and such. However, for some reason that can only be explained with otherwise redundant camera trickery he has some kind of 'Matrix'-like superpower which allows him to do a lot of implausible stuff I just accepted in the end. You can't fire a bullet through an entire labyrinth just because you believe in it(or maybe you can,I wouldn't know), but if you really plan on enjoying this movie hell get used to things like this. Even though the conclusion with the circle is even too much for me. Seriously,what the hell? Either way,it keeps you occupied for a couple of hours.",8,3,7,18 July 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Mayhem!
","This sequel if possible makes even less sense than the original, but chances are you won't care at all because it just looks absolutely amazing. This is really James Cameron at his finest, with all kinds of breath-taking effects and action scenes that are about as pure as action scenes can get. CGI can do miracles sometimes, but nothing can really top a good old-fashioned motorcycle-truck chase with constant shotgun blasts. I make the movie sound somewhat dumber than it really is though, because it actually takes some time out for real character development as well. The friendship between an average boy and a robot who somehow learns to have feelings (kinda) could be a movie all by itself, here's it's just a really beautiful side story. Granted, Edward Furlong can be pretty annoying in some scenes, but he's pretty darn tough to hate during the climax. I also really enjoy the villain in this movie, a terminator who just for the heck of it can transform his arms into knives. I don't know why I find that clever, I just do. This is probably one of the best action flicks ever made.",9,2,3,9 November 2010
Apocalypse Now," The horror
","Exciting, groundbreaking, epic, and that's just the opening scene I'm talking about. The Doors playing over a wall of fire, it can't really be beat. This is the movie that makes so many other Vietnam movies redundant. There are no heroes, there is no patriotism, there's just a group of people in a situation they really don't want to be in. And they really want to go home. This is an anti-war movie more than anything. There are no guns and explosions, well there are, but this is a war drama more than an action movie. The pace is pretty slow, making room for a lot of beautiful cinematography. Man this movie looks great. Those shots of their boat hovering over the water, bathing in the sun, so powerful. This movie is also about anticipation. Who is this Kurz? The viewer just really wants to know. The last half hour has a really great atmosphere to it. This may just be the best (war) movie ever made.",10,0,1,3 December 2007
The White Ribbon," Disturbing journey to a very dark place
","Michael Haneke spent more than ten years on this production, which explains why every little detail about this movie is right. From the first frame on this movie grips you with its bare-bones style and unbearable silence. There's no music, long stretches without dialogue, most scenes only use natural lighting so the screen often goes black, but none of that is needed to generate an intensely powerful suspense. This is mostly due to the excellent child actors, who put in very effective performances. You feel sorry for them, but at the same time they're very ominous. Haneke's message seems to be that suppression only leads to more suppression, a scary basic idea that makes for a very frightening film. Rightful winner of the Palm d'Or, and I'm pretty sure it only got snubbed for the Best Foreign Film Oscar because several judges later admitted to never even having seen the movie.",9,1,4,12 November 2014
Rocky IV," Dragoooooooo!
","Rocky's rumbles with Apollo Creed and Clubber Lang were entertaining enough, but in this movie he finally goes for the real enemy: communism! If you thought parts II & III were cheesefests, you were right, but you ain't seen nothing yet. In this movie Rocky Balboa appears to single-handedly end the Cold War, is there anything this guy can't do? This entry has the same ingredients all the other ones have, but all of these ingredients are turned up a notch for the sake of pure awesomeness. The obligatory bigger, stronger opponent? A Soviet-trained Dolph Lundgren. If you can think of any living creature more lethal and powerful than that, stay the hell away from it. The training montage? Really long, really cool, and as 'inspirational' as only the best and cheesiest 80s sports movies can be. Even the inevitable synth pop soundtrack is great in this one. The only part I didn't care about at all in this sequel: the drama aspect. Paulie and Adrian were more than tolerable in the earlier ones, but here they're just bland and lame. The kid isn't interesting either, and the less said about the robot the better. Sorry Sly, but you kinda suck at writing comic relief. It's not too bothersome though, this movie is still incredibly fun.",8,0,1,4 March 2011
Face_Off," Oh John Woo, don't ever change
","If you can watch a John Woo film without being on the edge of your seat, I'm pretty sure you have no pulse. 'Face/Off' is such an inventive movie when it comes to style, the techniques are just dazzling and all the action scenes are well above classic shoot-em-ups. I especially love that scene where hero and villain are standing back to back, Woo already sorta did that in 'Hard Target' but somehow it's even better here. 'Face/Off' is not all action scenes though. The plot, though completely nonsensical, is very compelling as well. It relies heavily on John Travolta and Nicholas Cage being able to switch characters without effort, and I'm glad to say neither actor disappoints. The way they pick up each other's traits is just brilliant. Even the family subplot of this movie is good, and family subplots in action movies are NEVER any good. Usually they're tacked on at the last minute in a desperate attempt to give characters depth, but in 'Face/Off' it's an essential part of the story. 'Face/Off' may be a dumb action flick to some, but it's a dumb action flick with one hell of a heart.",8,0,1,17 August 2012
Collateral," Vincent is one cold mo-fo
","The concept to this movie is endearingly simple: cab driver picks up a contract killer, then tries to figure out how not to get killed. In between he also drives him to places to kill some other people. It's not the greatest of plots, but that's irrelevant when the execution is so great. I always adore seeing Tom Cruise as a villain, this man was made to be evil. Just check out his composure during the nightclub scene, Tom Cruise just has no business being nice. Jamie Foxx is also very good as the voice of reason throughout all the crazyness, he portrays a character you can really side with and you even don't really want him to die. Michael 'Heat' Mann is probably as close to Hitchcock as this generation will ever get, and 'Collateral' definitely contains some real gems when it comes to suspense. To me the absolute highlight is the jazzman scene, I could watch it over and over again for days straight. It's just perfect, the way it's built up is so brilliant. The only bad thing about 'Collateral', the only thing that keeps it from being one of my absolute favorites, is the silly ending. It doesn't fit the movie, and it seems a lot like something the producers came up with long after the script was green-lit. A disappointing end to an otherwise fantastic movie.",8,1,2,11 June 2012
Bad Teacher," Pure filth, I love it
","I think there are two main elements that keep this movie from having a decent rating. Firstly, it's incredibly silly. In my opinion the style totally suits the outlandish story, but occasionally even I needed a break from all the...well, basically from the Amy character. Lucy Punch plays her perfectly, she's so unbearable cheerful that you really can't wait for bad things to happen to her. If that sounds disturbing, well it's just the effect that the movie has on you. Because that was going to be my 'secondly'. It's a disturbing ride, you're forced to side with a character with no morals or conscience because it's just so entertaining to wonder what she's going to do next. If you don't mind either of these things, you'll find that there are a lot of laughs in this one. Particularly Justin Timberlake is fantastic in this (no, seriously), he's not the centre of attention but he should be damn it. His nonsensical 'I hate slavery' speech is probably the highlight of the movie, though there's a lot of competition. 'Bad Teacher' is one of those typical movies that get slammed upon release, but very slowly find a cult following afterwards (and rightfully so).",8,2,4,23 February 2014
Aliens," The perfect horror-action blend
","While the original 'Alien' certainly got under my skin more with its claustrophobic shots, I would say 'Aliens' is at least equally entertaining. What I like most about James Cameron's action movies is that he never looks down on the genre. It's not because he makes action that the movie shouldn't feature well thought-out dialogues, a coherent story and actual characters, quite to the contrary: there's no point in doing awful things to your protagonists if we don't care about them in the first place. The first act is purely about getting to know the characters, that way it actually has some dramatic value when they inevitably get killed. The action itself looks amazing as well, it's incredible what you can do with practical effects if you don't have CGI to bail you out. The alien queen was so huge it needed fourteen crew members to make it move realistically, but the upside to that: it moves realistically, not pixel by pixel. I miss that charm in modern day action movies, but thankfully a movie like 'Aliens' is infinitely rewatchable.",9,1,2,5 January 2016
Tropic Thunder," Funny for a while
","A biting satire of pompous war movies, that's something we can all applaud I guess. I for one love Vietnam films, but even I laugh at their ridiculous pseudo-intellectuality every once in a while. Sadly, the premise of 'Tropic Thunder' wears thin too quickly. Or to put it in a different way, this movie is just too damn long. Robert Downey Jr. is hilarious in the first hour, but then you've pretty much seen it. Ben Stiller and Jack Black, same thing. The movie doesn't really have that many jokes, it just thrives on its outrageous atmosphere that you've guessed it, fades after an hour or so. The only parts that are truly and utterly hilarious are the parts with Tom Cruise and Matthew McConnaughey, they make the thing worthwhile. As for the rest: it's witty, but to me it isn't anything special.",7,0,1,6 March 2011
No Country for Old Men," Unconventional but highly effective thriller
","This movie took a while to really get into, but once I did I was pretty overwhelmed. It isn't a classic fight between the good and the bad, it's more like a brilliant cat-and-mouse game between the unlikeable and the even more unlikeable. I felt bad for Llewellyn Moss, who had no idea about how far over his head he was, but he's mostly the hero because of the contrast with Anton Chigurh. Chigurh is the unstoppable evil, which is mainly apparent in the gas station scene, in which he decides the clerk's fate in a coin toss. It's so random, it has nothing to do with the main plot, but he wants to kill him because he can. That's the frightening thing about Chigurh, he does bad things for no reason. It's a brilliant character, and his cold-blooded antics give the movie a breakneck pace. The pseudo-intellectual ending scene is an anti-climax, but that's pretty much the only criticism I can give.",9,4,6,8 March 2010
The Love Guru," Painfully boring watered-down 'Austin Powers'
","Some comedians can build up an entire career by doing the same thing over and over again, but Mike Myers sure seems keen on proving that he isn't one of them. In my opinion his schtick already started getting kinda old about halfway through the second 'Austin Powers'-movie, maybe 'The Love Guru' never really had a fighting chance to begin with. Guru Pitka may be a new character (actually even that's negotiable), but don't let that fool you: this is basically just a fourth 'Austin Powers'-movie. The jokes all seem like rejected material from previous efforts, and the obligatory sexual innuendo is somehow even more tiresome than the one in 'Goldmember'. To compensate for the fact that none of the jokes work, Myers had a rock-solid solution though: just have Jessica Alba's character crack up at everything. Seriously, I can't even remember any of her lines, just constant unconvincing laughter at absolutely nothing. The most painful role is for Ben Kingsley though, this movie makes you long for the days when he played bit parts in Uwe Boll movies. Even Jim Gaffigan is unfunny in this movie, how is that even done? This thing flopped for good reason. Now where did I put my 'Wayne's World'-DVD?",2,2,5,11 June 2011
Remember the Titans," Worth it for Denzel Washington
","The best parts of this movie are the long motivational speeches by Denzel Washington, who plays that typical sports coach from the movies that we're just supposed to believe can actually exist somewhere (this one's even based on a real person, apparently). I wonder where they keep all those intelligent, well-spoken dream coaches, but let's move on. Apart from Washington's performance, the movie isn't particularly thrilling yet still enjoyable. It works around that old theme of hatred between black and white, unfortunately most of the characters aren't really compelling enough to focus on. Some are however, and it's also just heart-warming to see some of the ignorant rednecks growing more tolerant as time progresses. 'Remember The Titans' isn't great cinema though, the writing just isn't smart enough for it to truly be a classic. Still pretty good though.",8,0,1,9 June 2010
Meet the Fockers," Robert De Niro with fake boobs, at your own risk
","Think 'Meet The Parents', just a bit dirtier. While the original movie had funny situational comedy, this one has a piece of foreskin falling into a fondue pan, which works just as well. Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand are welcome additions to the cast, even though their characterisations are quite predictable. De Niro's character is very conservative, so let's make these guys ultra-liberal, it's kinda easy. Still, the movie has a sort of inherent sweetness, which mainly becomes apparent near the ending. The jokes are also consistently funny. The stuff that was funny in the first movie is also funny here, so I figure fans of 'Meet The Parents' can't possible dislike this one. Decent sequel.",6,0,0,8 November 2010
Saving Private Ryan," Amazing visuals and then some
","Every casual movie fan knows the notorious first 20 minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan', and rightfully so. This introduction is just absolutely breath-taking, World War II has never been so close and in your face. However, a thing that's regularly ignored is that the other 120 minutes are really just as good. The characters are all pretty compelling, even Vin Diesel's performance is very convincing. You really manage to get to know all these people throughout the second act and you can sympathize with all of them, which in a way is kind of a bummer when they start dying on us. Screenwriter Robert Rodat puts in a whole bunch of war movie clich√©s (the inevitable emotional highlight!), but let's be honest, who doesn't love war movie clich√©s? I wouldn't say this is the definitive World War II movie because there's no such thing, but it does provide some really interesting angles.",9,1,2,15 March 2011
The Pianist," It's like Schindler's List only I care
","I don't go as far as saying holocaust movies are vanity projects of directors showing that they too can make an epic.But where Spielberg's 'Schindler's List' was somewhere way in the distance and ages ago,'The Pianist' puts you in the action with the old trick of having a main character you care about.Bit by piece we get to see the downfall of the Jewish community in well,everywhere.Originally they just get discriminated and won't get to do anything to be anywhere,but are still members of society who usually don't get killed.Then it gets ugly.The ghettos,the incredible lack of everything,the random executions,I knew they existed but never have they seemed so sincere on behalf of the makers.What to say about an old man eating what appears to be liquid corn straight of the road?Eventually we learn yet again that the holocaust in fact,really made no sense.We're talking about Western Europe here,and it isn't even a long time ago.People were somewhat educated,thought for themselves when the Gestapo wasn't watching,and still most of them just went along with this crap.I was fearing a 'Night Of The Living Dead'-style ending,but this is based on an autobiography so that would have been impossible.Five years of hate packed in about two hours,and it works.",10,5,10,5 May 2008
The Mist," Decent, but well below Darabont's standards
","Frank Darabont is a director that just really loves his characters, and because of that I figured Stephen King's 'The Mist' would be right up his alley. The entire book is about a bunch of people who don't know each other being stuck in the same place for ages, which sorta resembled...hey wait a minute, that IS every Frank Darabont movie. However, 'Shawshank Redemption' and 'The Green Mile' centered around compelling protagonists and delightfully goofy side characters, while most people in this adaptation of 'The Mist' are just boring. Take Marcia Gay Harden's religious fanatic for instance, how does such a bland, one-dimensional character get so much screen time? Thomas Jane isn't really much better though, and he's the freaking lead. It's not all bad however, story-wise 'The Mist' definitely has its moments. It's pretty nice how the horror is gradually built up, and it also leads to a true killer of an ending. There's lots of interesting stuff happening, it just doesn't happen to interesting people. When you look at this as a Darabont film, it's disappointing. When you don't, I guess it's not bad.",6,0,2,29 October 2011
22 Jump Street," Sequel that fixes all the flaws
","This movie summer is pretty much going to be nothing but sequels, prequels and reboots, but if they add as much to the original as this one does it won't be completely useless. '21 Jump Street' had its moments, but it also followed a boring, formulaic plot and featured extremely repetitive comedy. '22 Jump Street' mostly just ignores its plot (which is...better?) and mixes it up a little. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are also way better in this sequel. In the original there wasn't much chemistry and they didn't exactly play off each other well. Here they're clearly improvising more and they basically make the scenes go whichever way they please. Furthermore, Ice Cube showed up for more than one day this time around, and his stereotypical angry police chief role is just an instant classic. '22 Jump Street' has every telltale sign of a lackluster sequel, but against all odds it's completely worth seeing.",8,1,6,9 July 2014
Unknown," Running in Europe is Neeson's full time job now?
","Judging by the poster and the plot synopsis this movie seemed like a cash-in on the success of 'Taken' (even more so than 'Taken 2'), but I was surprised by the different style and the fact that Neeson is slightly less implausibly bad-ass. He's just an average guy that tries to prove everybody is framing him, he doesn't do much fighting but it isn't required to keep the compelling plot interesting. The story is genuinely well-crafted and gives you a conclusion that you don't see coming from miles away (unless you're amazing at that type of thing). Oh, and Bruno 'hey, isn't that Hitler from Der Untergang?' Ganz is in this, a highly underrated actor that effortlessly adds a bit of class to any movie he's in. In the end things may get a bit unbelievable, but the movie's twist is such a great find that I doubt you'll mind the lack of realism.",8,4,5,24 November 2014
Million Dollar Baby," Boxing movie and then some
","I figured this was just heated-up 'Rocky' but what do you know, it's not. The story seems basic to the naked eye, but it actually turns out to be pretty brilliant once you get halfway or so. This does in fact start out as a true underdog story, and the nobody who becomes somebody out of sheer will power has been done to death. But then you have some more stuff that happens and the whole thing is put in a different perspective. Hillary Swank is pretty good, but this is Eastwood's movie, and not only because he directed. His performance is really intriguing, he's really just close to the stock character of the hard-ass trainer, but he's doing so much with it. And I'm not really much of a fan of presumed emotional highlights but this one really works. Whatever praise it got it deserved it.",9,1,3,2 March 2009
The Evil Dead," That...was cool
","Sam Raimi did something directors rarely do, give the audience what they want. There's no lengthy build-up, that's a start. It can be important to care about the characters, but endlessly postponing action just makes me mad at everyone. Then there is blood and gore, and while being over-the-top is often seen as criticism, it's actually quite difficult to achieve this flaw. You can make any amount of people die horrible, violent deaths, but most of these movies just look like the director got bullied at school. Doesn't apply to 'The Evil Dead', this is really just cool. It's up-tempo HG Lewis really. Incredibly entertaining almost from the first minute until the last, never has a horror movie been more deserving of a cult following. It's kind of a guilty pleasure, just not one I feel particularly guilty or ashamed about. It's not something new, it has never been overly original, but it has never been done better either.",9,1,3,18 January 2006
From Dusk Till Dawn," Gives the audience what it wants
","This certainly is one of the most peculiar movies I've ever seen. It starts of as an everyday Tarantino crime movie with all of his typical trademarks, then suddenly it has vampires killing everyone. Some see the movie as uneven and weird for that reason, but personally I see the vampires as a welcome surprise that add to the surreal atmosphere. They're an extra feature, and a pretty great one at that, because these vampire scenes are really top notch. They're a great combination between over the top violence and morbid humour, a perfect fit for a grindhouse showing. The whole second half of this movie just screams love for the genre, this is essentially a big-budget fan film. They even hired Tom Savini as an actor just because they could. This movie just really gets the adrenaline pumping, which is what I look for in any horror movie, I just rarely find it. The names of Tarantino and Rodriguez raised a lot of expectations, but in my opinion all of them were met.",9,1,2,5 July 2009
Jurassic World," Gives the audience what it wants
","'Jurassic World' doesn't really work as a sequel to 'Jurassic Park', and barely works as a homage. It does however work as a great dumb blockbuster, and I think by this point in the franchise everyone's willing to settle for that. It's a brainless popcorn flick, the kind where the villain is someone who thinks uncontrollable prehistoric monsters can be made into weapons and little kids quip 'I can't wait to tell mom!' two seconds after they escaped a gruesome death. Speaking of gruesome deaths, this movie is chock full of them. The script to the original was obviously a lot better, but this one has almost non-stop action, a surprising amount of variation and a truly dazzling climax. The clumsy set-up of the inevitable love subplot was even a bit too dumb for me (the first dialogue between Claire and Owen is the most forced exposition you'll ever see), but apart from that I was entertained throughout.",8,0,6,7 July 2015
The Hangover Part II," Nothing new, still pretty funny
","'The Hangover Part II' is basically the same movie as 'The Hangover Part I', just in a different city. The plot's exactly the same, and the wacky events will certainly lead to a lot of deja-vus. However: is there really something wrong with that? I don't think anybody is ever going to watch this sequel expecting some sort of surprising variation. It's tough to care, you just want to sit back and laugh at the next stupid thing Alan is going to do. Zack Galifianakis is far from a versatile actor, but he has the one type of character he can play down to a tee. 'The Hangover Part II' just delivers, without doing much more. If you liked the first, you'll like this one too. If not well, it's going to be a long two hours then.",7,0,5,30 May 2011
Big Fish," Very Burton, good anyway
","Tim Burton is a weird phenomenon. They say you either love or hate his work, but I tend to do both. 'Ed Wood': truly a wonderful movie, one of the best I've ever seen. 'Edward Scissorhands': completely unwatchable pseudo-intellectual artsy drivel. I've rarely seen a director that can be so good and so bad at the same time. Either way, 'Big Fish' is essentially just 'Forrest Gump' with a twist, but I'll put it in with the winners. The concept of a man narrating his life through made-up stories is pretty interesting, and gives Burton the opportunity to create another fairy tale world. They're only stories anyway, he can have anything he wants happen. There are times in which you really want to believe them though, if only it wasn't for the giants and werewolves. I personally think the movie's strong point is the ending, it's a time when father and son finally understand each other. Pretty touching stuff. At no point does this movie ever become truly great (except for Steve Buscemi's performance, obviously), but it's a good watch.",8,0,0,18 May 2009
Annie Hall," As real as romance gets
","Has romance ever been captured more perfectly? And furthermore, is there anything more beautiful than the extreme awkwardness that comes with falling in love? 'Annie Hall' is a very unconventional romance movie, by which I mean that it's not as distant as the average movie romance. You actually care about these people, because it appears as if they could actually exist. That's probably why this movie is so effective. The melancholic cinematography also gives it a raw power that is hard to describe. I've never really gotten into Woody Allen's filmography, and his neurotic character rarely stays interesting for an entire movie, but here it fits in perfectly. This is probably his most accessible movie, if not just his best.",9,0,0,28 March 2010
This Is Spinal Tap," The simplicity of a gardening accident
","I have no idea why, but this could be the funniest thing I've ever seen. Spinal Tap is cult, and despite being in ludicrous situations all the time, I think they also quite accurately show us how a rock band works, like a talented version of KISS. The bizarre thing is that the music they play is actually very good. It's like they found some leftover rock clich√©s and made something good of them. The focus is mostly on fake behind the scenes footage though, that classic scene where they can't find the stage anymore always does the trick for me. I also love when they get a sneak preview of their album cover and it's just entirely black. And then there are about a hundred other moments. This is one of the few movies I prefer to see alone because seriously if I have to explain they're not an actual band one more time my head is going to explode and lava will gush out. A brilliant mockumentary.",10,0,3,2 April 2008
Drag Me to Hell," Sinister as only Sam Raimi can be
","Personally I thought movies like the 'Spiderman'-trilogy, 'A Simple Plan' and 'For Love Of The Game' were excellent, but they all shared a common flaw: they made Sam Raimi look like a mentally balanced person. 'Drag Me To Hell' on the other hand wants none of that, it caters to the 'Evil Dead'-crowd and does so very well. There isn't much of a story, but that's pretty much the point. Raimi has always stated he wants his horror flicks to be non-stop fun, and that's exactly what this is. It's a pretty stream of consciousness sort of thing, the feeble plot about Alison 'Big Fish' Lohman getting cursed is just an excuse to come up with as much demented stuff as humanly possible. Put some maggots in a pie and then somehow make it bleed, why not huh? Anything goes here, that keeps things interesting throughout. You never know what's going to happen next, which is pretty damn scary. It's also a plus that eventually the movie works up to one of the the greatest climactic scenes I've ever seen in a horror movie, now that's what I call a finale. Overall this is a great movie that won't let anybody down.",8,28,43,27 November 2011
Saw," Stuff nightmares are made of
","I've never really taken the time to fully get into the whole 'Saw'-franchise, mainly because the word 'franchise' is always sort of off-putting to me. I mean seriously, seven movies in six years? Perhaps the makers can just work really, really fast, but randomly shelling out entries at that kind of ridiculous pace just screams 'cash cow' to me. I might start checking them out anyway though, because the original 'Saw' is nothing short of magnificent. It's gripping and terrifying from the first minute to the last, and it keeps putting you on the wrong track just because it can. There's some stuff in this movie that doesn't make a lick of sense, but that's forgivable because all of it's done in the name of mind-shattering suspense. The acting is also great, particularly by Cary Elwes. 'Saw' is not a movie that leaves you with a good feeling, but who really wants it to? Excellent dark thriller.",9,1,3,4 August 2011
Life Is Beautiful," Or maybe,the holocaust was just some rock festival
","I don't really think people could just run around in concentration camps, or have a nap, or joke around for that matter. Seriously, I was surprised that they didn't have a scene with a sack race. Anyway, Guido, a guy who spends the entire movie laughing like an ass, tries to make the best of the situation and tells his son a story about winning a tank when he gets a thousand points. Kids believe the darndest things. This is supposed to be heart-warming, even though it just plain isn't. The writing is just never really good enough.This movie doesn't really have much going for it in the first 100 minutes or so, but the ending is nice. It's really touching and all. Okay, the power gets thrown in the dumpster because a dead character doubles as the narrator, but it's still good. The idea behind this film is Oscar-worthy, but the way it's done is often just boring and Guido's joking isn't that amusing to me. Maybe others can see the humor is not shutting up but I don't. So overall, 'La Vita e Bella' looks like a missed opportunity.",7,4,9,24 July 2006
A Clockwork Orange," Might as well be Kubrick's finest
","Malcolm McDowall's Alex is easily one of the best leads ever to make it to celluloid, he's truly a thing to see. Alex is just right, the right mannerisms, the right tone of voice, the right expressions. They say no movie can compete with a person's imagination. They are wrong. I've read the book, but this interpretation of it is better than I could ever imagine. Just the inspired narration already gives you the idea that you're watching something brilliant. A lot of the genius to this movie is in the way the violence is handled. Innocent people get beaten up all the time, and Kubrick manages to make it look really beautiful. The classical music is a great touch as well. I watch Kubrick movies mainly for the stories that are always well-developed and the cinematography, but the actors steal this movie. Not that Kubrick's efforts are any less remarkable though. I'm running out of hyperboles, but this is a marvellous work, one of Kubrick's true masterpieces.",9,2,4,24 March 2009
Groundhog Day," They say our love won't pay the rent...
","The story is quite ingenious, it all starts from there. Watching Bill Murray going through the motions of the same day over and over again, is funny up to some point, then it gets increasingly scary. It's just not a very fun situation. I've never really seen the creepy side to that song 'I Got You Babe', but there you have it. The movie doesn't really go for gags, it's just all so wacky and unpleasant at the same time. I don't know why kidnapping a groundhog is funny, it just is. However, it's likely that the real idea is actually a social comment. People don't have time anymore, nothing ever changes, live the day to its fullest, take your pick. That's probably the angle that separates this from a whole bunch of inferior comedies. It's nothing special, but it's nice that's it's there I guess. The ending was the best choice they could made I think, any bigger, more spectacular, more explanatory ending would have just been an anti-climax. Oh, and Andie MacDowell looks quite good in this movie. That ought to be said. Very enjoyable.",8,0,1,26 January 2009
Total Recall," Forgive the clich√©, but they don't make 'em like this anymore
","Ah, the magnificent work of Paul Verhoeven. From time to time I tend to binge on it and plough through his whole American filmography (even including 'Showgirls', when I have the courage) in a day or so, because this man is the absolute master of mixing artistic value, satire and pure unadulterated camp value. 'Total Recall' is an awesome roller-coaster ride of increasingly ridiculous action set pieces. The extreme violence is not quite as raw as in 'RoboCop', but it's cartoonish (yet still gory) style always gets a chuckle out of me. The best part about this though is the casting of Arnold Schwarzenegger in the lead, who delivers his cheesy one-liners with gusto and makes good use of the somewhat clueless glint in his eyes. He really brings home the point that his character has no idea what's going on, comparable to his performance in the much inferior 'The 6th Day'. He's also made a fantastic commentary track of this movie that I highly recommend, where he just basically describes what's happening on the screen with a childish enthusiasm, adding absolutely no behind the scenes information whatsoever. It's just an absolute treat, you won't learn a single thing about how the movie was made but it's still one of the best commentaries I've ever heard. Even without the track though this is a true classic, albeit a pretty sleazy one.",9,1,3,30 November 2014
Rocky," Eye of the tiger
","This is the ultimate underdog movie. I don't know what makes Rocky Balboa so sympathetic apart from the obvious contrast with the big bad opponent, but get this, I think it's Stallone's acting. Some people see him as a hormone-enhanced bodybuilder stereotype who just happened to be around when they needed someone tough. Those people are entitled to their measly, inferior, wrong opinions, but Stallone has got talent. Even if you don't take into account that he wrote the screenplay, hey what the hell I will take that into account. This is a solid screenplay. There are just so many good ideas in there. Balboa is just a great anti-hero. He was milked a lot over the years, but somehow always managed to keep his dignity. Furthermore, there's a great joy in seeing Rocky running around places accompanied by flocks of cheering bystanders. It's the cheesiest thing, but you can sense the euphoria. And let's not forget the undying 'Rocky' theme. Everything about this movie is just so awesome.",9,0,0,22 March 2009
Rocky III," The birth of 'I pity the fool'
","To start of with a very balanced opinion: I'm deeply in love with this entry. Not only do we get TWO boxing matches between Rocky and Mr.T, he even engages in some boxing/wrestling cross-over against Hulk Hogan at some point. Pretty much everything that was cool in the 80s and then just vanished is incorporated here. It's like the storyboard to this movie was entirely made up from kid's drawings, that's how crowd-pleasing it is. The action is a lot better than in the second, but this third one also stands out when it comes to the characters. You care a lot more about them this time, which makes the sentimental scenes so much more touching. Did I mention this is also the debut of the whole 'eye of the tiger'-thing? It totally is, and it was still really, really awesome back then. One of the best in the series.",8,0,0,26 February 2011
The Godfather: Part III," Not on par with the first two, but hardly a waste of time
","Ah, 'Godfather III', the ultimate black sheep. So often criticized, so often ridiculed, so consistently beaten into the ground that I was actually pretty reluctant to see it. When two of your favorite movies of all time are followed by some sort of popular running gag it's pretty off-putting, and you fear it will ruin the character's mystique. Unjustly though, because 'Godfather III' is a very worthy end to this trilogy. Most of what you may have heard is true, but it isn't as bothersome as I thought it would be. Yes, Sofia Coppola couldn't do a decent line delivery to save her life, but at least she isn't really in this thing much. Yes, some returning characters have become completely redundant , but if you leave them out you're stuck with about two original actors (and I'm counting Richard 'Al Neri' Bright, which is already a stretch). It's flaws just don't weigh up to its merits, that's all I'm saying. 'Godfather III' carries all the ingredients I loved about its predecessors, it's chock full of memorable scenes and feature some of the best lines in the entire trilogy. The scene where Michael utters the now legendary 'Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in' is absolutely magnificent, and there's plenty more where that came from. The finale is pretty mediocre compared to the rest, but the movie immediately wins you back with an incredibly powerful ending scene. No better way to end this trilogy, I'm actually talking about both that scene and the entire movie. Don't believe the hype, this final chapter is definitely worth seeing.",8,0,1,16 November 2011
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," Awesome nonsense
","'Tenacious D In The Pick Of Destiny' is rock and roll translated to celluloid, everything about it just kicks you in the face. The plot is all over the place, you just never know where the next scene is going to take you. If you managed to figure out the ending to this movie in advance, I'm really impressed and slightly worried. The acting is also really energetic, Jack Black plays every Jack Black character ever but here it fits best. I also love all the cameos, some faces just show up totally unexpectedly (I won't spoil the surprises). The best part is undoubtedly the music though. Tenacious D might just be the best guilty pleasure band in the history of guilty pleasures. Much like with Spinal Tap, I know it's played for laughs but I just genuinely enjoy their music. This movie is worth watching for 'Master Exploder' alone. Overall 'Pick Of Destiny' is pretty great, even when you're not stoned (though it probably helps).",8,0,0,1 January 2013
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," As touching as movies can get
","What is there really left to say about 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' that other reviewers haven't already said, and in a more eloquent way to boot? By this time it has been well-established that this is a truly great film, with an excellent multi-layered script and an absolutely brilliant performance by Jack Nicholson. However, I think the true strength of this movie is partially in the supporting roles. The supporting cast never turns into lame caricatures of mental patients, all of them give very realistic performances. Their characters are mentally unstable, but they're still real people you can side with. They're likable guys, and they need to be because otherwise the contrast with nurse Ratched wouldn't work out. Brad Dourif, Christopher Lloyd, Will Sampson, Danny DeVito, in my opinion these guys add just as much to the movie as Nicholson does. Furthermore, this film has one of the most memorable endings I've ever seen. It's so fitting, it's so touching, and despite the nature of it it still leaves you strangely satisfied. One of the best movies ever made.",9,2,4,12 August 2011
Army of Darkness," My least favorite of the trilogy (but still pretty awesome)
","I've always liked the serious (though I use that term very loosely) aspects to the 'Evil Dead'-saga a bit more than the comedic bits, so 'Army Of Darkness' was definitely an acquired taste for me. The first one was a pretty straight-forward horror movie, the second one cleverly mixed bone-chilling horror with comedy, but this one is just pure slapstick. And to be honest, I still don't know how to feel about that. I laughed a lot during this movie and some scenes are just incredibly inventive (Ash fighting his evil clone has got to be the highlight), but on the other hand things are getting really self-aware now. The second one was already the sheer definition of tongue-in-cheek, but at the same time it never felt forced. This one does, mainly because Ash is such a cartoon character here. 80% of what he says is supposed to be a clever one-liner, which gets a little tiresome by the end. On the other hand though, are B-movies that much less entertaining if you know the makers are in on the joke? I wouldn't say so, and 'Army Of Darkness' is a movie that's just impossible to hate. It's a dude with a chainsaw fighting zombies in a medieval castle, what flaws can a movie like that really have? 'Groovy'!",7,2,4,26 April 2013
Die Hard with a Vengeance," The ultimate spilling of testosterone
","'Die Hard With a Vengeance' (the title alone puts my adrenaline level to the roof) is so much more than an action flick. Well, no, but it's pretty cool, and I'd say it surpasses the first two, which isn't really common(usually by this time in the series,nobody's trying anymore). This is just what an action movie is supposed to look like, a compelling story with a breakneck pace that gives everyone an excuse to blow things up. The acting is perfect, it's bad but it's like action movie bad. Especially Jeremy Irons' role was quite amusing, with the thick German accent he dragged around. This movie is just really, really cool, that's all there is to say.",9,1,2,10 November 2007
Con Air," So much speed, so much energy
","The most awesome scene in this movie must be that fighting scene where somebody shoots our hero in the arm and he just keeps on walking. This thing has really slapped together a great cast for an action movie. John Malkovich! Ving Rhames! John Cusack! Steve Buscemi! The relevant Nicholas Cage! All in one movie, all in great straight-forward action scenes that remind me of John Woo. The writing is semi-mindless, with an appetite for destruction, but occasionally it shows more depth. Buscemi's conversation with the little girl is another highlight. The plot has been done millions of times, but never really this well. The developments are great, they keep everything dynamic, where most action flicks fade out and tend to drag near the ending. From that angle the screenplay is actually pretty creative. It's a movie that's probably at best in a wide-screen, surround sound, cinema experience, but you could watch it on a cell phone and it would still be cool. In conclusion, 'Con Air' just plain rocks.",9,1,1,27 January 2009
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," A night at the improv
","A comedy that mostly ditches the script and gives the actors their freedom can really only go two ways: it's either going to be really good or really terrible. It just depends on how well the actors play off one another and how long they have to ramble on before a decent punchline comes along. Thankfully, this movie is chock full of fantastic comedians so there was never really much of a risk. If you put Will Ferrell and Steve Carell in a room together you can count on it that they'll have something good in five minutes, and writer/director Adam McKay (without underestimating his input, obviously) lets the magic happen. It also helps that Will Ferrell knows everyone, so there are a lot of amusing cameos in here. They just keep piling on new familiar faces as the movie progresses, without it ever feeling forced. 'Anchorman' is just about as disjointed and filled with non-sequiturs as a movie can get, but in the final act there's even some room for character development and a genuinely touching ending. Infinitely rewatchable.",9,0,1,2 December 2014
The Shawshank Redemption," Pretty much the perfect film
","There's nothing in life more meaningful than endlessly talking about movies, and there's no discussion as entertaining as fighting over which was the best year for films. I always go for 1994, mainly because it produced three movies that are truly unique and show up in every best of list you can imagine. I mean, it's pretty tough to find a person that doesn't have either 'Forrest Gump', 'Pulp Fiction' or 'The Shawshank Redemption' in their personal top ten. While the first two movies still have a considerable group of opponents (to some people 'Forrest Gump' is too much of a tearjerker, while 'Pulp Fiction' apparently glorifies violence too much), 'The Shawshank Redemption' is one of those movies nobody can really dislike. It's a movie that goes beyond matters of taste, the story, writing and acting are so undeniably good that it's tough to come up with a counterargument. Writer/director Frank Darabont is also a fantastic dialogue writer, particularly when it comes to bit characters. You can also see this in the somewhat inferior 'The Green Mile', characters who only have one or two lines say the perfect line on the perfect moment. The amazing performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do the rest. The best movie ever made? It's definitely up there.",10,1,1,15 March 2015
Music and Lyrics," Kind of a guilty pleasure
","Generally I'm not really that into romantic comedies, but it's hard to deny putting Hugh Grant in a 80s pop group is pretty goddamn hilarious. Therefor the opening sequence of the movie is probably the funniest, which isn't as negative as I make it sound. The rest of the movie is typical Grant fare: boy meets girl, charms her with his ineptitude, falls in love, has brief fight, falls in love again. The question is: is there anything wrong with that? Predictability is pretty much a given in these movies, so I'm not going to complain about it. Apparently Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore didn't really get along on set, but I don't think that really shows on film. They genuinely seem to like each other here, good enough for me. Even the ending, which everyone sees coming from miles away, was rather touching. Or is it corny? Bit of both. Definitely one of the better Hugh Grant films, if that means anything.",7,0,0,21 February 2010
Scream," It's cool, it's fast, it's loud
","First of all, 'Scream' is in fact a good movie, but is that really why it was so successful? I mean I'm pretty sure not even half of the audience picked up that this was supposed to be a satire of a bunch of movies they never saw. Really all they fell for was the old slasher formula, slightly updated. Hell it's not a bad formula. As a scary movie this doesn't work, since the killer is not menacing at all so there never seems to be any danger. Because there are just some characters that are not supposed to die, the killer at times becomes unrealistically weak or dumb, and that's something I could have gone without. But it's just so brilliant to have these people waking up in their own slasher movie having to follow a bunch of movie rules to survive, I could appreciate that. This is probably the nerdiest movie to ever make 100 million dollars. And also it's just good entertainment, does that garage door scene ever get old? The big downside to this, obviously, was the whole new wave of slasher. There's only a number of times I can see a bunch of 'Dawson's Creek'-rejects run for their lives while it's obvious who lives and who dies two minutes in. But this, I like.",8,0,0,27 September 2008
Halloween," Meh
","'Halloween', a movie a lot of people consider to be the most suspenseful and therefor best horror movie ever made, just didn't really do it for me. The premise is good enough, but the supposed tension that everybody keeps mentioning, I can't really find it or get into it. I'm really trying to like this horror classic, I'm genuinely trying to be interested but it just isn't working. Especially that scene where Laurie is stuck in the wardrobe, are we actually supposed to be believe she has any chance of getting killed? Perhaps that's the problem, you know exactly who lives and who dies. We see our main girl running, but I know she's never in any danger, because she's the main girl. I see some secondary player who I know won't make it until the end, and it's still not scary. And even though Myers has been in a mental institution for quite a while, he sure takes his sweet time for everything. He could have killed every character ten times during the course of this movie. Maybe it's just dated, but I can't really say that about any other John Carpenter movie. A mystery to me.",5,1,4,20 December 2005
The Silence of the Lambs," Superb thriller
","'Silence Of The Lambs' is really that kind of movie that gets under your skin and lays eggs. Doesn't sound appetizing, but that's pretty much the point. It's a very vile and intense film, it's filled with dark, unnerving scenes that make you feel dirty for watching them. The tension just never goes away, it never gives you a moment to lay back and relax. Anthony Hopkins has surprisingly little screen time, but somehow his uncomfortable presence is always felt. Damn those prison scenes are ominous, downright unpleasant to watch really. Jodie Foster is pretty brilliant too, even with her much-ridiculed Southern accent she still gives a stellar performance. The climax is also everything you expect and more, excellent to say the least. To me this is one of the best and most exciting thrillers ever made.",10,1,1,10 March 2011
Signs," Moving writer's block
","Shyamalan's star began to fade with this pretty disappointing third film, the style is still as well-executed as in his previous movies, and his special style of dialogues still occasionally have that strange effect on me, but the plot is just way too weak to keep things interesting. It's the subtle horror of an alien invasion, in a typical M. Night fashion we don't really get to take a good look at the supposed villains. All of this really does work, but not for two hours. And the customary twist ending doesn't really deliver either, it just ruins things. If you can even call the ending a twist, things just suddenly stop making sense. I know were supposed to be amazingly intrigued by this oh-so mysterious situation and the foreshadowing of the dead wife, but I just can't get there. And was the hint the wife gave really necessary? It's a pretty basic plan, they could have thought of it all by themselves. Perhaps Shyamalan is just too much of a one-trick pony. Get a basic story, add a little mystery, throw logics out of the window, and there you have it. It worked so well in his first two features though, we'll always have those.",6,3,6,12 February 2009
The Ringer," 'South Park' did it better
","It may just be me, but hasn't this movie been made a hundred times already? A guy finds himself somewhere he really doesn't want to be, surrounded by people he doesn't like, but in the end he pulls through and learns to love his new surroundings. Eventually he understands that you shouldn't judge people by yadda yadda yadda, now let's beat some kind of villain. Oh, and there you have the love interest with the asshole boyfriend, right on cue. Perhaps our hero should catch him cheat on her. What do you know, he does. This movie is almost shockingly formulaic, and virtually no effort is made to bring in anything creative. Some people find this movie offensive, but this movie is just way too lame for someone to be offended by. Besides, it's not like the mentally handicapped are actually mocked, at least not enough for one to care. I liked Johnny Knoxville in this movie, but he can't save the bad screenplay like he could in say, 'Walking Tall'. He's still pretty good, but his comedy talent is wasted here. 'The Ringer' might seem controversial from a distance, but in reality it's just really forgettable and uninspired.",4,0,1,20 March 2010
The Producers," Spriiiiingtime for Hitler
","The plot to this movie is really quite interesting, and gives Mel Brooks a podium to go completely over the top with one politically incorrect (whatever that phrase means) joke after the other. The 'Springtime For Hitler'-sequences are pretty hilarious, just so in your face, even by today's standards. Nazis who are singing and dancing are just really really wrong. Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder work well as a duo, but it's really Kenneth Mars who steals the show as the insane German guy stereotype. The whole comedy acting is pretty old-fashioned, by the book even, but this is just the type of screenplay that needs to be done that way. Exaggerated characters and grotesque situations, the system works. I wouldn't go as far as calling it the funniest movie ever made though. Don't get me wrong, it has plenty of good bits(the auditions, for instance), but not all of the material is that great and it does tend to drag at some points, I didn't really care for that. But it's still one of the most inspired comedies ever made.",8,2,3,8 February 2009
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A classic
","Freddie Krueger has been milked pretty badly over the years, mainly because Hollywood has been out of ideas for quite a while, but it doesn't make his first appearance any less intriguing. While in the later sequels, and anywhere else Freddie appeared for some reason, he's more of a horror comedy type of thing, here's he's just a straight-forward monster. The only extravagance he gets in the cool voice Robert Englund gives him, he doesn't take up the spotlights. Wes Craven knows how to handle his creation, and while he's at it he creates a lot of tension as well. His directing has never been better, he even puts in a girl hanging on the ceiling just for the heck of it, just to see if he could pull of that trick with the spinning room. And it makes for a great scene, but then again this thing is pretty much nothing but great scenes. It also has a sympathetic girl next door, which is rare in a horror movie. I didn't even want her to die or anything like that. Pretty groundbreaking.",9,1,2,16 January 2006
Get Him to the Greek," Kind of an afterthought, but funny nonetheless
","When I saw 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' I thought Jonah Hill was criminally underused, and thankfully this spin-off makes up for the damage. There was just so much juice left in that character, and it's all squeezed out here. Granted, it's barely the same character anymore (the obsessed fan schtick is mostly dropped), but the chemistry with Russell Brand is still very much there. And his girlfriend is Elizabeth Moss, that helps. The story isn't that inspired to say the least (trying to get somewhere but encountering troubles, AKA the plot to 80% of all comedies), but the great interaction between our main duo really manages to keep this show on the road. Even if some of the lines fall flat here and there, you just can't stay mad at this movie. Not great, but definitely good for some laughs.",7,1,2,1 January 2013
The Hangover Part III," Bits and pieces glued together, but it works well enough
","When 'Hangover II' came out some people we're pretty angry about it, mainly because they felt like they had paid for the same movie twice. Same plot, same jokes, same 'surprising' twists, I still enjoyed it but at the same time I wasn't blind for its lack of creativity. Luckily, the third one is very different. Somewhat less luckily, this movie is just all over the place. The other ones have clich√©d plot(s), but at least they were as coherent as this genre is ever going to get and had a clear structure to them. This one well, even after you've seen it entirely you're still not sure what the hell it was about. It just doesn't gel that well, it's very fragmentaric. On the other hand though, it does do something that's rare for a part 3 these days: it actually adds something to the franchise. Not only does it have a lot of funny new set pieces (the burglary is definitely one of the best parts of the entire franchise), but it even sorta develops its characters and provides some very decent closure. I particularly liked what they did with Alan, he isn't just a gimmick anymore but actually tries to change his ways here and there (if he feels like it, obviously). The ambiguous relation between the Wolfpack and Mr. Chow is also explored very well, the question whether Chow is a friend or foe pretty much fuels whatever little story there is. I also liked the throwbacks to the previous ones, this can be seen as a standalone movie but probably shouldn't. And lastly, John Goodman is incredibly under-used but at least he's there for a brief while to be hilarious as ever. If you hated the other ones, you'll probably hate this. If you liked the other ones, well I honestly don't know. All I can say is I quite enjoyed it.",7,0,0,2 June 2013
Click," Almost great, but keeps chickening out
","Ever wondered what 'It's A Wonderful Life' would have been like if it contained large amounts of obvious gross-out comedy? Wonder no more, just go rent this one. 'Click' can be extremely touching and heart-warming at times, but then David Hasselhoff gets farted on and you're back to square one. Sandler's character feels how his life has slipped away, remorsefully thinks about all the things he missed but then screw it, let's randomly throw in three dozen liposuction jokes. The movie's often just way too Hollywood for its own good, it has a lot of potential but the makers never have the guts to be truly unpredictable. I guess the fact that's it's such an uneven film wouldn't bother me if the humor was actually funny, but as I said even that's somewhat of a letdown. The material is all just so uninspired and stale: humping pets, fat jokes, kids getting hit in the face with something, old people talking dirty, some of it even seems like rejected material from Rob Schneider movies (if that even exists). Thank God Christopher Walken drops by for a few scenes, pretty much every laugh I remember came from him. The ending is pretty much the final nail in the coffin, but thankfully it also pretty much sums up the entire movie for me: good story with lots of potential, but Hollywood turns it into a boring, predictable, risk-less snoozefest. What a waste.",5,1,2,11 November 2011
The Cabin in the Woods," Works as horror, works as satire, just works
","'Cabin In The Woods' is very much a 'Scream 2.0', constantly playing around with genre conventions and actively mocking how wrong your expectations are. It starts of like any other slasher flick (five stereotypes go to the woods, do stupid things, get killed), but it's always hinting at the fact that sooner or later it'll start doing things differently. And when it delivers, it delivers in stride. The third act is beyond amazing, not just because it's so violent (blood and gore doesn't necessarily make a movie better) but because it surprises you over and over again with new twists while still making sense (within its own realm, at least). 'Cabin In The Woods' is more than just a (past) hype or a gimmick, it's already one of the most original and thought-provoking horror movies of the (albeit still young) decade. It also gets bonus points for featuring the scariest clown in movie history.",9,1,4,10 July 2014
The Nice Guys," Great sleazy atmosphere, great writing too
","'The Nice Guys' has some trouble finding its footing in the earlier scenes, but it becomes incredibly entertaining once it goes completely off the rails. When your story is about two shady characters trying to solve the murder of a porn star in the 1970s, I want everything in the movie to be ugly and slightly disturbing. Shane Black (of 'Lethal Weapon' fame) has certainly managed that, particularly the current Russell Crowe is just perfect for a role like this. The plot is also slightly more interesting and unpredictable than in an average action movie, this movie has enough unexpected deaths to make you genuinely worry about the protagonists. Particularly for Angourie Rice, who just steals every scene she's in. The thing I loved most though is the incredibly dark comedy Black puts in throughout. It's not forced, it's not shocking for the sake of being shocking, it's just there because it's funny and it fits the rest of the movie so well. 'The Nice Guys' is one of the funniest movies I've seen all year, infinitely rewatchable.",9,7,14,13 June 2016
The Breakfast Club," A classic, but maybe not a particularly great one
","The one thing I truly respect about this movie is that it's never boring, despite the fact that's it's pretty much all set in one room and with the same five characters over and over and over again. There aren't really any events to speak of, these guys just talk to each other for the entire movie and somehow it stays interesting. Not that any of the characters is even all that compelling, I think this movie is mainly saved by the acting and the fact that it's so delightfully 80s. I mean, just check out the cast: they've got Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald AND Anthony Michael Hall. John Hughes did not like half work. Also the music our standard cool guy (Judd Nelson) listens to is the kind of stuff that anyone who's not in 1985 would instantly laugh at. 'The Breakfast Club' is truly a product of its time but then again, what the hell is wrong with that? Apart from the stilted ending, this movie is simply very entertaining.",8,0,0,21 September 2010
Goodfellas," Thoroughly bad-ass
","This is one of those movies that's pretty much nothing but classic scenes. Thinking about 'Goodfellas' is essentially re-imagining the entire movie, usually starting of with Joe Pesci. Pesci's is by far the most threatening character in this movie, and the atmosphere gets really tensed when someone gets in his way somehow. He doesn't want to be pushed, and you don't want him to be pushed. The scene where he asks what makes him funny is one of the most uncomfortable moments ever caught on film. This movie often feels uncomfortable in fact. Whenever any secondary character is involved in a conversation, you know something will go wrong. The shady background characters in this movie really drop like flies, this movie has an incredible amount of raw violence and ice cold death scenes. Even by the standards of a classic crime movie, this movie just feels really harsh and unpleasant. Which doesn't make it any less entertaining, by the way, this movie really knows when to move on. I'm not going as far as calling this the best gangster film ever made, but it's up there.",9,1,2,2 July 2009
The Simpsons Movie," Relieved that it didn't suck, but that's about it
","This movie has some incredibly witty moments, but sadly pretty much all of those can be found in the first half hour. That first half hour perfectly captures what 'The Simpsons' were like in their first ten seasons or so, but also cleverly brings in new elements. Also, it has Ralph seeing Bart naked on the street and going 'I like boys now'. I think that moment alone should deserve six stars, but I digress. Then a plot kicks in about Homer polluting a lake and being hated by everyone and the movie really starts dragging itself to the end more and more. From then on there isn't really much creativity left, it's just the Simpsons running from one place to another and some attempts to political satire that come of as rejected material from 'South Park'. I get it, Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn't seem very bright, now move on. This movie is only 83 minutes long, but it really feels like they had to do anything they could to even reach that length. Overall, this movie isn't a total disaster like some have claimed, but I did expect a bit more from these writers.",6,3,4,15 November 2009
High Fidelity," Didn't work for me
","The main weakness to this movie is that John Cusack's character isn't very likable, which makes his relationship troubles rather uninteresting. He might find some luck, he might not, I don't really care. He's way too whiny to like, and the many occasions on which he talks directly to the camera are downright cringe-inducing. Allison married Kevin! I don't care dude. Leave me alone. Another thing that bothers me here is the unstoppable avalanche of pop culture references. Pretty much every band the writers like is mentioned in this movie, which comes of as pompous in a 'hey, check out the obscure stuff we know' kind of way. They try their best at clever dialogue, but then bail on that and figure they can just play some Beta Band music. Generally when a movie has a cult status I can at least see why exactly that is, even if I don't like it. Here however, I'm just dumbfounded. I don't even remember half of it even though I've just seen it. Anyway, I sat through it because there are some good performances here and there, but there's little else I enjoyed.",4,6,15,29 March 2010
