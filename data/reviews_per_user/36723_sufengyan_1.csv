The Sound of Music," Wonders made in love
","People will always watch the films that they are fond of several times, so do I. Just like this one ---The sound of music, which is known to all the world. Really I love it so much that I cannot remember how many times I watch it. Maria, such a pretty and kind name and person for me now, is a tutor, but she love hr student just like her children and give them almost all her love. To free them and bring them out to the nature. She ignores the chitin¡¯s military management on the children, which at last makes leave. Yes, she can do what she like, never gives up or accepts other¡¯s will, even it will make her bad. She distinguishes right from wrong and understand how to maintain her rules .at last, she gains her reputation in the children and the trust and love of the chaptin. It is certain that what the classic is the well-known songs in it, which seems universal. If you ask me how do I think of the music in it, of course I love it. Why not? I cannot help doing so, including the whole movie.",Null,1,8,29 October 2004
