Blade Runner 2049," Fantastic movie
","Denis Villeneuve creates an incredible, immersive world. Ryan Gosling IS Officer K, and his relationship with Ana de Armas's Joi is completely believable yet unique. The musical score by Hans Zimmer & Benjamin Wallfisch is out of this world. Just a great film that I could (and will) watch many, many times.",9,2,9,21 September 2019
