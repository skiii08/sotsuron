"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," An OK show, shows rednecks are everywhere...
","This is an interesting movie, about three drag queens out on a quest to get from Sydney to Alice Springs for a gig. This movie works particularly well if you are familiar with gay personalities as they do fit the stereotype and the parts are well acted. In fact, they do a more convincing job of the drag queen persona then most modern gay comedy movies. This is not a good movie for families or homophobic straight men. Though tolerant men and women will find a lot of comedy in it. And it does take a good bite out of travel in central Australia. The three lead actors are quite famous for many other projects, and none of them are gay. Have fun figuring them out (before researching on IMDb).",7,1,4,30 March 2005
