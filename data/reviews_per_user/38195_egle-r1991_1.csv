The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," The Folly Thus Disappointing Interpretation of the Book and the Failure of the Twilight Continuum
","I have loved the Twilight books and read them quite a few times. And I have watched all the movies up till now. The first Twilight movie was very inspiring and new – I was fascinated. Although, there were a few major mistakes in the movie. Actually, I saw the movie first and then read all 4 of the books. That led me to the Twilight insanity. I have become a total Twi-heart. I was starved for more and I had been sitting on the edge of my seat for the New Moon movie release. New Moon was great, if you talk about the content of the movie and it's adequacy to the book. Also, the quality of filming and directing was really high. The thing that was really not though trough carefully was the overdone vampire makeup (especially the men's makeup, Jasper's in particular) that made them very artificial. Though, the director was really strict on the audiovisual art rules and made the movie easy to follow and understand. The movie was romantic and a bit cheesy bus so was the book.The Eclipse movie was the one which shook me to the core. It was great all the way. Only the development of the story was a bit soupy. But again so was the book. And finally, yesterday I saw The Breaking Dawn Part I. I have waited for this one even more than the previous ones. And to be honest I was deeply disappointed in the direction of the movie. It was so hard to follow and to understand what is happening – day, night, day, night, here's Edward standing here he's already doing something else, there is Bella dreaming, here is the morning and she is getting ready for her wedding. There was no unity and harmony in the direction of this movie. Sometimes things even looked not logical at all. I think that people, who didn't read the book couldn't really comprehend the chain of the action. There are certain rules that help to build the story of the movie in one undivided line and I think the director should stick to them the next time. The most ridiculous part was the wolf pack division. The robotic voices and then Jacob's shouting on Sam really cracked me up. I was laughing from this scene until the end of the movie. And I don't really understand why the director chose to represent the movie in this scary and creepy and gross way. It was not at all like that in the book. To sum up, the failure of the Twilight series has begun. I really hope that the next movie will be a lot better than the last one. Still, I am looking forward for the Part II: it will totally ruin the Twilight series or it will rescue them from the complete absurdity.",3,17,34,18 November 2011
