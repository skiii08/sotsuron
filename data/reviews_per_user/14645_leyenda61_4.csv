The Ring," great premise, but it REALLY needs a sequel
","Okay.  So you've seen this movie.  Is is a great scary movie or are there so many unanswered questions that it was just too unsatisifying.  The answer to both questions is 'Yes'.This movie was a great date flick.  I'm pretty sure that most people understood that the little girl was some 'force of death', like the grim reaper.  Everyone was at the edge of their seats trying to unravel the mystery of the connection of why the killer's modus operandi was confined to killing only those who saw the tape.There were some other technical questions that went unanswered. Maybe on an artistic level, it is better leaving everything up in the air and allowing the audience to theorize their own explanations.  But still, the questions beckon for answers.  The only problem is that in the sequel-happy mindset that is Holloywood, most of us know that most sequels somehow cheapen the novelty and artistic integrity of the original.",8,0,0,25 November 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," no wonder it's doing so well at the box office
","First of all, I really wasn't expecting to be impressed with this movie, even though I am a Johnny Depp fan. Most movies this summer have have been pretty bad, most notably, Bad Boys II.  Jack Sparrow was always two steps ahead of everyone, and I really liked the way that the story tellers didn't reveal was his wily plans were until they came into fruition.  The casting was dynamite, as was the cinematography, writing, humor, and set decoration. If I were to raise some of the films weaknesses, I'd say that 1) It was probably too long and had at least one too many endings, 2) some of the violence was a little too graphic,in particular, the slicing of throats and when the British navy troops were run through the sternum with swords.  I might also have editted out the crying child when the pirates plundered.  It was a little too realistic.  The denoument was a little drawn out, but i like the way that even though the damsel's finance was written as unlikable, they didn't cliche him and make him into the scorned rejected villain. But all in all, I definitely recommend this movie.  Maybe the sequel will be a little more family-friendly, but still, I endorse this film as sequel-worthy.",8,0,1,29 July 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," I don't get it.
","Why the heck is everybody jocking this movie?  Unless you're a diehard LOTR fan , I really don't see what all the big hoopla is for.  Granted, the visuals in LOTR: TFOTR was unlike anything anyone had seen before and it was worth double the price of admission just for that, but honestly, I just couldn't get interested in the story.  I do have to say that Christopher Lee's presence was awe-inspiring and the sets were breath-taking.  I felt that ,visually, I was taken to levels I had never even imagined.But I felt that this installment didn't offer anything new.  It seemed to only draw out TFOTR's worst flaw--endless exposition.  This installment looked to me like a 3-hour montage.  I didn't find anything particularly memorable, except the excellent CGI of the creepy-crawly dude (sorry, I didn't quite catch the name).  It wasn't that there was bad acting--it was more like there was no acting, or rather, no opportunity to act.  It seemed like everyone was either just doing a lot of staring 'out somewhere' because the odds were so insurmountable, or that they were scuffling about in groups of twos or threes headed 'just over the other side of that tall hill or mountain'.Kudos to the LOTR movies for staying faithful to the books, but as a non-fan, (yes, I know, I am probably blaspheming) it all seemed rather tedious and silly.  I thought it was bad enough that TFOTR ended with the Fellowship being chased by a crap-load of Orks (sp?) who are easier to kill than the buffalo in a particularly memorable episode of the Simpsons.   I mean, jeez!  Is this the world's most inefficient army or what?!?!  These Orks are easier to kill than the 'middle-eastern' armies in an early Schwartzeneggar or Stallone movie.  There is just no element of danger. Everything seems just to gosh-darned easy.   TTT ends with a good-guy army of 300 (and eventually some elves) taking on 10,000 Orks.  You just know that the Fellowship will pretty easily overcome ridiculously impossible odds.  Sadly, I could suspend my disbelief and therefore, I could not enjoy this movie.This movie gets the 3rd Bass gas-face!",1,3,9,18 January 2003
X2: X-Men United," worth the price of admission, BUT...
","How was X2?  Ehh...fairly decent.  definitely worth the price of admission, but the movie is not without serious flaws.X2 was thankfully not as boring or lethargic as X-Men, but it still needed a shot of adrenaline.  Even though there was a boatload of characters, i felt that not enough stuff actually happened in the movie.  I felt there needed to be at least two more one-on-one fight scenes and also a good group-vs-group maylay.  Nightcrawler's intro and the Wolverine/Deathstrike fight were great, but I felt they were bigger teaser to upcoming bigger events that just never happened. The X-Men were repesented as a minority sect fleeing their persecutors.  I think that perspective makes for great story-telling, but i think for an action movie, Singer spent too much time having the X-Men on the defensive.  I've read reviews about Marden's portrayal of Cyclops.  Yes, the role was reduced, but I think his brief presense and emotional breakdown of losing Jean were very well done.Lastly, I wasn't crazy about the ending.  X-men versus lots of water. That was about as satisfying as the alternate ending of Blade 1 featured on the DVD.  In the alternate ending of Blade 1, he's up against this 5 story blood tornado.  But the makers reshot the ending because the scenario of protagonist versus liquid just doesn't produce a big enough pay-off to movie-goers.  People go to see a big-budget action movie to see the ultimate conflict resolved in a big action sequence.  Sorry, guys, spewing water just doesn't cut it.  The resolution has to be with the antagonist that faced the protagonist with overwhelming odds throughout the movie, not with a soulness, faceless force of nature that appears in the last reel.There are a lot of other little things that needed tightening up, but enough people have written about them, so I don't feel i need to.  Granted, while there was a lot of room for improvement and the movie was too long to sit through (w/o jetting the the bathroom), i still walked away happy that I saw it.  I think non-comic books fans would be uber-bored, but I must confess, I will definitely pay to see X3 when it rolls around in a year or two. Hopefully, the movie makers will have learned from the mistakes in X-Men & X2",7,0,0,9 May 2003
