The Blair Witch Project," Save Your Money!
","For years critics have agreed that the movie Plan 9 From Outer Space was the worst movie ever made. The Blair Witch Project is a strong contender to take that title. There was absolutely nothing scary about this movie. It was just plain silly and boring, not to mention the bad cinematography. The budget for this movie should not have exceeded $100, and that would only be for film and developing. The movie only proves that with strong marketing you can sell anything.",Null,0,0,22 October 1999
Pretty Woman," Give Me A Break!
",I like Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. But a movie about a prostitute (Roberts) always acting so cheerful and giggly although she cannot pay her rent and an investment banker (Gere) who gives up a multi-million dollar deal because he develops a conscience all of a sudden after meeting Roberts.
