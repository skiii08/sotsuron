It," It didn't meet the expectations
","First of all, there was ridiculous amount of jump scares that weren't even scary, they tried so hard that it lost its taste at some point, story got boring in the first half of the movie it took too much time to combine the stories of the children, everything was CGI and not realistic enough, nothing unexpected happened maybe trailer gave away too much.
