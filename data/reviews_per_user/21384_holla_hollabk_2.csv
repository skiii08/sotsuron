Mission: Impossible III," unbelievably breathtaking
","i just had to tel all the readers how amazing this film is! this movie has everything humour, romance and most of all fantastic...i have to say it again fantastic action sequences that will literally blow you away! i was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole of the film, every time you think something is going to be OK they instantly throw another complication in the mix that keeps the audience gripped and wanting more! i personally enjoyed the way the film began and as the narrative goes back to that point, you think you know what is going to happen next but you have no idea!the plot and performance from the actors is what makes this film superb and i believe this film to be Cruise's best film madei have to give my gratitude to J.J.Abrams for a magnificent job of directing this masterpiece. i especially enjoy his work on Alias which shows through this film with the similarity of Marshall and Benji as the technicians, that deliver the humour to the film/show.i am truly blown away from how great this film really was and i HIGHLY recommend it to everyone, especially to action lovers! trust me this is a film not to be missed!",10,0,1,15 May 2006
A Walk to Remember," Not like any other teen/love story ! ! !
","The first time I ever saw the trailer for this movie, I knew I would love it. I have always wanted to watch this movie but never been able to find it. I recently finally watched it and I absolutely loved it!The storyline is great and they couldn't have chosen better actors to play the roles. I have to say that Shane West and Mandy Moore played the characters so magnificently, the characters were so alive it gets the audience really involved. Jamie (Mandy Moore) is really inspirational as she plays an outcast but she never lets anything bother her, she is happy with who she is and the life she lives. Shane West's character Landon I loved the most for many reasons. I love the way his character changes throughout the film based of the influence of Jamie and how he always goes out of his way to help Jamie cross off the things on her 'life to do list'. This is really lovable! West and Moore have so much chemistry together and this really shows in the movie. Once you see a scene that makes you cry, you will be crying throughout the whole film. The whole film is an emotional roller-coaster that will tag you along the whole way. I became emotionally involved in this film, I couldn't stop crying throughout the film, after the film and every time I think about it I burst into tears! I always get emotional during romance/drama films but this film stayed with me, I have never felt this way about a film, until i came across A Walk to Remember. This film will always be one of the best films I have ever seen. It isn't just a typical teen/love story, it has so much strength and intensity. There are so many key moments in the film (that I don't want to mention because it will spoil it) that make the audience so attached, and this is why it succeeds so much! The acting, music, story are all fantastic! I highly recommend people go and see this movie!!! Just have a box of tissues next to you!",10,1,2,23 February 2005
