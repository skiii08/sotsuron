The Blair Witch Project," It's not the arrival, it's the journey
","I rented this film, so I don't know how well it would show in a theater. On reflection, I speculate that it can't possibly be good. The ending is too much of a slap-in-the-face.But we had a lot of fun watching it. The highlight of the film is watching the flashlight flail around in the darkness, in the middle of the night, miles away from nowhere. You are ready for Heather's powerful flashlight to bounce off of...anything and everything. When it doesn't happen, you go slightly crazy with anticipation. I suspect that folks who didn't like the film, would have to admit that, but only if painted into a corner.But arguing with people and trying to make them like the film, would be ungracious and would miss the point. Should this have been marketed and hyped the way it was? Probably not. Should it have been kept secret so we could all save our money? No way! All in all - if you connect with it, this was a fun flick.",Null,0,2,17 November 2001
12 Angry Men," Benefit of Hindsight
","(Spoilers) I really liked the message of the movie: A lot of times things that look crystal clear at first glance, upon deeper inspection, aren't so clear. The acting was top-notch all-around, especially with Juror #9. The product ends up being not very preachy, which is a considerable achievement given that it's built entirely around a simple parable.With the benefit of hindsight, though, one can see a few things about this that I personally find really disturbing.The question that drives the movie is whether the jurors have properly awarded the defendant the benefit of any reasonable doubt, and as the climax approaches, the attention given to this reaches a fevered pitch. Left behind in the dust, is the equally critical question of whether the defendant is really guilty. There's a scene early on when Jack Warden, the juror who just wants to get the voting over with so he can watch a ball game, meets Henry Fonda in the washroom. The last two lines in that scene discuss the possibility that the boy may be acquitted, even though he is guilty. Fonda says something to the effect of 'that very well may be' or some such, and to my recollection this is the last time this possibility is even considered.The jury may have released a murderer onto the streets. You can make the argument that with the presence of reasonable doubt, this was their job. I agree. But as Henry Fonda walks down the courthouse steps to resume his everyday life as an architect, would it really then be fitting to have the happy 'a wrong has been righted' swelling-orchestra music, as our hero walks proudly among his fellow citizens with his head held high? Doubt or no, conviction or no, this kind of peace-of-mind is not lying in wait for you after your last day on a real jury. There are jurors who want it anyway, and because of that, will not convict anyone. They have seen this movie, and want to be Henry Fonda. I've served with them. It's a pretty serious problem.There is a short speech given by Fonda shortly after he is revealed to be the one juror who wants to acquit. Several times in the speech he makes the point that the defendant is poor, has had a rough background, and has been beaten up a lot. It is not entirely clear where he is going with this, since the movie is supposed to be about what is reasonable doubt, and how the doubt applies regardless of economic class. There is at least one other juror who wants to convict because the defendant is poor; does Fonda mean to say with a defendant who was wealthier, he himself would have voted to convict? That doesn't seem likely at all. But then why bring it up? It means something to other jurors, but it isn't supposed to mean anything to Fonda. The only way it could support any of Fonda's arguments, is if he was making decisions based on the way those decisions made him feel about himself, rather than based on the evidence. This is something jurors aren't supposed to do.Four years after this movie was made, the Supreme Court defined the Exclusionary Rule in Mapp v. Ohio. So by this time, you weren't supposed to convict anyone unless you knew they were guilty beyond any reasonable doubt, and in addition to that, if you knew too much, then you still couldn't convict. During the sixties, conviction became such an unlikely goal even when the evidence seemed compelling, that a lot of District Attorneys refused to make arrests even though they knew a suspect posed a significant danger to society.By the seventies, Americans were so fed-up with the 'justice system failing us' that they began turning politicians out of office in bulk, hoping against hope they could fix what was broken before their own children were murdered or their wives were raped. Between Vietnam and Watergate, this was a third salvo against our fragile faith in government, and it was an erosion of our trust that we don't talk about too much today.What really concerns me is that a little while after this film was made, with the poorest Americans being forced to live among violent people and thus becoming increasingly interested in vigilantism, suddenly we had a huge surge in movies about 'Taking the law into your own hands.' Dirty Harry, Death Wish, and countless made-for-TV projects. In summary, the pendulum swung in one direction, then a few years later, the other. Hollywood got to make money both times.I have trouble getting completely behind this film because it's a concentrated effort, ultimately a successful one, to get that pendulum swinging wildly. If we spent that relatively short amount of time, just fifteen years or so, leaving 'revolution' out of it and reforming our justice system in baby steps, the mistakes of the past could have been avoided. I do not know if it was possible to fix what was broken back then, by doing this -- convictions weren't always carefully considered back in the 1950's & earlier. But a lot of innocent people would be alive today if all those violent felons, in subsequent years, were arrested like they should have been.I would say, if you're going to serve on a jury, by all means rent this because it's a very meticulous and passionate reminder of your civil duty, it makes some great points, and everything in this movie is highest-quality. But also on your required-viewing list would be Primal Fear, the Richard Gere movie. Better yet, watch that one last, so the final scene really sticks in your mind.Nobody should be serving on a jury, if they can't seriously consider the consequences of releasing people who are really guilty of violent crimes.",8,36,60,7 August 2005
"Monsters, Inc."," Fine, fine material, exactly what it was intended to be
","Okay, on the mkfreeberg scale, I don't want to own this movie but I would look forward to seeing it again. I would miss doing something important if someone brought it home via rental, so I could see it one more time. That describes a 3+1/2 star rating, or 8/10. But it deserves at least 9.Someone else said they hated it because their son squirmed through the whole thing. I can relate to that. My son has squirmed through things that were actually quite good, and that I wanted to see. It makes me want to kill him. But that's why God made me the Dad and him the son - I have better taste. Condemning a film for that, is kinda harsh. With this one, if it matters, he was always ready to go out to help me buy candy, and he was always ready to get absorbed in the pictures from the film. He wasn't a pain in the neck at all, even though I'm sure the story went over his head. He HAS been a pain in the neck before...like Sleepy Hollow, which I'll never forget... but that's another story. Probably was my own stupid judgment anyway.All I can say here, is - if you're one of those parents like me, who lose a lot of patience with movies made JUST for the kids when you're paying for all the tickets and popcorn and overpriced soda - this is for you. I'm a thirty-five year old, gray haired old fart, thoroughly out of touch with his feminine side AND his inner child. This thing had me laughing from beginning to end. That's about all that should be necessary to say.",Null,0,1,16 November 2001
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Can't say I'm not disappointed
","The lesson here is simple and useful. If you're watching an action movie where the action hero is just barely awake enough to protect his sweetie, to selflessly throw his body over hers when something blows up, but is too thick and stupid to see something coming that actually has something to do with the story... ...you are watching a chick flick. Like the Mighty Joe Young remake, or Final Destination II. Movies like this are different from Die Hard or James Bond movies, because it's up to John McClane and 007 to unravel the riddle in a mystery in an enigma. Indiana Jones can figure out the bad guy is digging in the wrong spot, so his movie is a guy's movie. Not the case here. If John Connor ever had this ability, he lost it before this movie started or picked it up after it was over. Everything has to be explained to him, while he listens, slack-jawed, then reacts with joy, despair, whatever. He never, ever puts himself ahead of the game, and it's obvious there is a crowd-pleasing rule in place to keep him from doing so.Which would be fine, as far as spur-of-the-moment fun action-adventure flicks would be concerned. But leaving aside the point that this installment arrives after a twelve year wait, there's a huge logical plot hole here. John Crybaby Skywalker Connor is the leader of the resistance and it's worth sending a killer robot back in time, at presumably enormous expense, to rub him out. Why is that? If he gave the resistance life with his resourcefulness, or with his ability to motivate people, T4 is going to have to supply some explanation of how he picked these things up. I would not put my life on the line to follow this man. I would not so much as loan him a couple of quarters to do his laundry.But he's George Washington of the 21st century. He makes the difference between a victorious (or insurmountable) resistance or no resistance at all, and he is shrewd and cunning enough to use time travel to arrange his own conception. It would have taken very little trouble to have him, just once or twice, work his way out of a jam like Michael Biehn did 20 years ago. That would have made all the difference to me.Can plot & character problems completely ruin a movie? Maybe not, and that problem doesn't ruin this movie. But it certainly costs it some points. The time-travel thread in T1 made my head hurt, because I cared enough about what was going on to pursue it. Because of the shabby treatment T3 gave to the story and the characters, it can't ever give me that headache because I don't care that much. I can't say the saga has been ruined, but I can't say I'm not disappointed.",Null,0,0,16 November 2003
The Patriot," Creme de la creme
","Before the end of Braveheart, my ass started to ache against the cheap hard theater seat. I was much less comfortable watching Patriot (at a drive-in), but I noticed it less. I would not have noticed my sore butt, the crick in my neck, etc. etc. even if Patriot was six hours long. That's a great film. Great on all counts. It's four stars. I would go out of my way to buy this film. Braveheart? I'd go out of my way to watch it...not really to buy it.Why is Patriot better? Front-to-back, it is dedicated to dealing with primal human concepts that existed long before we were here, and will endure long after we are gone. After you've seen it a few times, you begin to realize this is not a story so much about American independence, as about a tug-of-war between life and death. The story about the Revolution is a sidebar. Want proof? Watch it beginning to end - at no time does any stretch of fifteen minutes pass, without the advantage shifting from one side to another. Life wins, death wins, back-and-forth, beginning-to-end. This is great storytelling.I think the criticism for playing fast-and-loose with history is valid, but not valid enough to tarnish the reputation of the product. Taking license with history is dangerous, after all, only to those of us who don't bother to read up. Failing to read up is decisional. You don't like how Mel Gibson invents people, covers up things, makes slaveholders look like heroes and decent people look like ogres? Fine. Go read about how it really was, and take his movies with a grain of salt. Everyone else isn't doing that, but if they're being mislead by Gibson's efforts, the deception pales in comparison to what HBO does to them every night. Cut him some slack. There's nothing in Patriot that compares to having an English princess knocked up by a Scottish bandit who really never lived in the same country as she did at any given time, and died when she was thirteen years old.The best thing about this film is you can watch it three, five, ten times or more and still see more detail you didn't notice before - detail meaningful to the story. This is yet another sign of great storytelling, and great filmmaking. Easily the best film of 2000, and every year since then.",Null,0,1,13 April 2002
Independence Day," Shallow people have too much money
","Right around the time this movie came out, I became aware of something that turned me off to movies in general. The problem was not, and is not, that Hollywood thinks we're all stupid. The problem is that parents are giving their very young kids way too much cash on the weekends to get out of their hair for the afternoon. They've created a powerful demographic segment, in the form of their pre-teen offspring who are downtown stuffing twenty-dollar bills into theater cash boxes.And deciding what next year's movies are going to look like.Well, the culmination of this bizarre experiment has to be ID4. The most telling review you could really gather about this, is that everyone who feels the need to 'defend' the film from the obvious criticism, uses the same two lines. One, movies are supposed to be entertaining and not realistic; two, the special effects were awesome.I go to the movies to be entertained, instead of being reminded of reality, just as much as the next guy. But a certain amount of 'Coyote and Roadrunner' physics, just ruins it for folks like me. Sorry. The President in a jet is really pushing the envelope. Yeah, yeah I know he was a Persian Gulf vet and they had an explanation for all this. But why was it necessary? Couldn't you make an even better movie, having the Prez on the ground, biting his fingernails with guilt over sending men half his age to certain death? That's made some good movies; it just takes some effort on the part of the writers, directors and actors. Maybe they figured the 'Living Legend Captain Kirk' avenue was just easier here. Unfortunately, that leaves them pontificating for two hours about how we're all in the same boat, and we'd better kick alien ass together; and then having one guy do everything. Essentially, they seriously contradicted themselves.But yeah, I know nine-year-olds don't care about that, and my money isn't worth as much as theirs.All this may seem like nit-picking, but it interferes with the focal point of the movie. This is a movie built to make you feel good after the closing credits have started to roll, and maybe more than a bit patriotic. When inside your head, you're going back over all the questionable plot points and wondering just what kind of a pig-in-a-poke they just sold you, one interferes too much with the other. So the purpose of the movie is, in itself, a bit of a contradiction. If you want to get in a patriotic mood on the 4th of July, my advice is to read up on the story how our nation was built. Skip this, unless you just want to watch things blow up and go boom.** out of ****, 4/10.",Null,1,2,17 November 2001
From Hell," How plausible is this supposed to be? *(weak spoiler)*
","Well overall, I have no ambitions to own this film but enjoyed it nonetheless. I'd like to see it again, and I would go out of my way to do it. In my book, that's three-and-a-half stars, or 8 out of 10.That said, most of this film is a painstakingly true-to-life - I don't know what the right noun is. 'Documentary' isn't it. It falls just short of that. The more I research JTR, the more impressed I am with the authenticity of the movie. I wish I took the time to read-up about the subject before I saw this.This movie is for people who are familiar with JTR 101. Check out casebook.org, read up on it until you've memorized the victims' names, where they were killed, dates the bodies were found, and God help you, the method & extent of the mutilation. Also do your homework on local geography. These are 'canonical' victims, of which there are only five.Then, you'll be able to enjoy this movie much better. But once that's done, on having the ending revealed you will be burdened with a conspiracy theory that is barely even ponderable, let alone plausible.In my opinion, that is the one glaring flaw of 'From Hell.' What was the point here? The sets are authentic down to, I'd believe, the square foot; and then the surprise ending can be easily debunked in a variety of ways. It's obviously not supposed to be believed by anyone who knows anything about the case.So by the time you educate yourself enough to enjoy this to the fullest potential, you're already taking the subject more seriously than they want you to. Other than that, this was very well done. The movies I've really liked, in the last ten years or so, I can count on one hand. This is one of them.",Null,1,1,11 November 2001
