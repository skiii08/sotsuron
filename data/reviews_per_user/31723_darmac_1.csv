Kill Bill: Vol. 2," - you get what you were looking for.
","let s face it, we all know what we are looking for with a QT film...we get it in this movie. Gore, good scenes and characters that you either love to hate or you think they are over the top. Aside from the tripe that will remain nameless this movie is as good as the rest...of the 2 I liked this better ( with the exception of the animation from the 1st ). David Carridine does a good job playing the character 'Bill' and is the face and the voice of the image of the character partially revealed in the first chapter of the 2 movies. Seemingly timeless and aged like the bark of a weathered tree he seemed....ah just see it...10 line minimum? IF you like Tarantino AND liked Chapter 1 THEN see it.",9,1,2,22 May 2004
