Come and See," A bit heavy-handed
","As a war film it was a nice change from the more Western variety I usually see. Good compositions of war's surreal nature and the consistent style of camera work in showing reactions and not the source was a good touch. What special effects that were used- not so good. But the explosions were first-rate.I guess I was expecting a Peckinpah-esquire twist on 'Cross of Iron.' What I got was the tired Germans bad, Soviets good theme. The Russian perspective on Partisan warfare and its consequences was nice, however. Let's just not forget the Soviet's rampage through Eastern Europe soon after. -Guess that wouldn't make as entertaining a movie.",6,4,28,6 December 2007
28 Weeks Later," Something of a let-down
","I had high hopes considering the quality of '28 Days' and what some of the reviews said, but too much in the movie was contrived. It seemed like the second half was an illogical or unnecessary series of events that were just used to see how much can be thrown into the mix without regard to plot holes and silly decision making by the characters. Glad I hedged my bets by seeing it at the dollar theater.The gore and violence were first rate (they should make movies like this as NC-17 and just go 'full tilt'), but the above issues became too much of a distraction. The acting and directing were fine- the writing should've had a few more re-writes before production.",6,3,6,15 June 2007
The Descent," Tense and claustrophobic
","A bit linear, but for what it's supposed to do (horror/terrror) it succeeds. The realistic, minimal lighting (unlike 'The Cave' or other films where ambient light always seems to come from 'somewhere'- much like guns with the never-ending clips) makes this movie uncomfortable for those with claustrophobia. The gore was first-rate and made more believable by the realistic environment the filmmakers established (unlike the Friday 13th fare). A few things at the end were a bit unrealistic (from a physics and evolutionary standpoint), but the fast pace (minus a slow beginning that didn't quite develop the characters for me to relate to them individually) makes it an original horror movie to see.",8,1,3,18 August 2006
