First Man," Two separate movies in the form of one
","This movie felt like two separate movies, one a family drama and the other how the Apollo 11 became Apollo 11.The first one its good but a lot of tragedy happened to the family lol but it doesn't have a lot to add to the other movie.The other movie shines with the visual effects, are awesome and the score is so fresh. The movie it's cool.",8,1,1,9 January 2020

","A masterpiece. I haven't read the book but now I will, from the things that I saw from Spielberg this is definitely one of the best ones.DiCaprio, Hanks and Walken are perfect in this movie.

Hereditary," Ari Aster you're a genius.
","After a day of processing this movie, I think it's the best horror movie i've ever watched.In this movie Ari Aster makes clear what a great director he is and what a great movie he can pull with 4 great actors. Toni Collete probably gives the performance of her life, Alex Wolff, Milly Shapiro and Gabriel Byrne are awesome but Collete and Wolff are the ones who really shined in this movie. Toni scared the s**t out of me in this movie and i'm probably going to have nightmares.Ari Aster is a genius and I can't wait to see more of him.",10,2,4,5 January 2020
Casablanca," A bit slow but the third act stole the movie

Se7en," Ernest Hemingway once wrote, 'The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' I agree with the second part.
","What to say about this movie? It's a masterpiece. Period.Se7en is very well crafted, skillfully written (Andrew Kevin Walker) and directed (David Fincher), starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Gwyneth Paltrow. This movie is about two detectives, a rookie and a veteran, hunt a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his motives. The creation of suspense and terror in this movie is amazing, it keeps you with the same information that the detectives have and you keep up the investigation.A film about two homicide detectives' (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt) desperate hunt for a serial killer who justifies his crimes as absolution for the world's ignorance of the Seven Deadly Sins. The movie takes us from the tortured remains of one victim to the next as the sociopathic 'John Doe' sermonizes to Detectives Somerset and Mills -- one sin at a time. The sin of Gluttony comes first and the murderer's terrible capacity is graphically demonstrated in the dark and subdued tones characteristic of film noir. The seasoned and cultured but jaded Somerset researches the Seven Deadly Sins in an effort to understand the killer's modus operandi while the bright but green and impulsive Detective Mills (Pitt) scoffs at his efforts to get inside the mind of a killer...It amazingly well constructed with great dialogue between characters and the acting of the 'John Doe' is amazing. The dark construction and design is perfection. The soundtrack also is very good.This movie enters in my top 50 movies of all time for sure. Its worth every second. Bravo",10,0,0,10 November 2019
Fight Club," The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club.
","Fight Club follows the story of the Narrator (Edward Norton) whose name is never mentioned, he is an employee of a car company who suffers from insomnia. The narrator attends a support group of testicular cancer victims and, after convincing them that he too is suffering from the disease, finds an emotional release that cures his insomnia. He becomes addicted to therapy groups and to the farce of posing as a victim, but the presence of another impostor - Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) - bothers him, so he negotiates with her to avoid meeting at the same meetings.After a flight home on a business trip, he finds his apartment destroyed by an explosion. She calls Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a soap salesman she had met on a plane, and they meet in a bar. A conversation about consumerism prompts Tyler to invite the narrator to stay at home. Tyler accepts on the condition that he is beaten. They both engage in a punching fight outside the bar, for the narrator to later move into Tyler's emaciated home. They continue to have more fights outside the bar, which attracts a couple of curious people. The fights pass into the basement of the bar, where a fighting club is formed governed by a set of rules.Fight Club is a black comedy and psychological film that manages to open your eyes to a reality that many ignore after paying attention to the material instead of living their lives. The satire about consumerism goes hand in hand with a dark comedy, touches of drama and suspense about who Tyler Durden is and to what end he does what he has to do. This almost unique piece shows us the wild and anarchist life of a group of 'knights' who don't want to die without scars. It is not an example to follow, nor is it to initiate chaos or to be masters of disorder... Just don't forget The First Rule.",9,0,0,7 October 2019
Memento," Remember
","Wow, Christopher Nolan is truly a genius. Probably one of the best original movies ever made, the screenplay and directing from Christopher Nolan is incredible and he deserved more recognition.This is a rare film because it's going backwards while the black and white scenes go in chronological order and that is a smart move and not an easy one. You need to see this film before you die.Now, where was i?",10,2,3,11 January 2020
Inglourious Basterds," One of the best from Quentin Tarantino
","Inglourious Basterds is one of my favourite movies of all time and i'll tell you why.Inglourious Basterds is a 2009 movie by Quentin Tarantino set in 1941 when the Nazis occupied France. In the first chapter Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) is introduced. Landa is the main antagonist of the film and in the first chapter he is looking for the Dreyfus family in France, however, Landa finds them but Shosanna Dreyfus is the only survivor.One of the first things you notice about the film is the great acting, amazing ambience of France during the WWII, Ennio Morricone's music is extraordinary and the writing and directing of Quentin Tarantino is still spectacular. The 2 hours and 30 minutes of film are worth it.My only problem with the film is the ending of Hans Landa but apart from that the movie is incredible.I think every award that the movie won is totally deserved and I would recommend it to everyone who likes war or dark comedy dramas. It's certainly one of the best movies from the writer and director Quentin Tarantino without doubts.",10,0,4,17 September 2019
Shaun of the Dead," Hilarious but a little bit overrated
","'Shaun of the Dead' a really funny movie but not everything, some of the jokes were a bit forced. Anyways, Simon and Nick have a great chemistry and is what makes this movie great. Edwar Wright first 'masterpiece'...?",8,0,1,14 January 2020
Knives Out," Had a fun time

The Irishman," The king is back
","Scorsese is back one more time for a bit of the old ultraviolence. I gotta say i was worried because the movie is 3h30m long but is worth it if you're a fan. The movie is slow and has to collect every piece of information for the last final hour. The soundtrack is amazing and the thing that shines the most in this movie is how superbly acted is the movie. De Niro, Pesci and Al Pacino together are great, along with Keitel,Cannavale, Plemons, Paquin, etc. Everyone is great and the de-age effects are EXCELLENT, you get confused if you're seeing the real actor or the de-aged version.If you're a fan of Scorsese you will love the movie, get comfy and enjoy it because it's one of the best pictures of the year.",10,2,5,15 December 2019

Ready Player One," Had fun! Sorry nerds
","I don't know why so much people don't like this movie.. i know they skiped a lot from the book but it's a fun movie with a lot of pop culture references! Just have fun!Its hilarious to read all the one or two star review because they are all people who are obsessed with the book, well sorry not sorry but this movie is incredible.The vfx are stunning and what I didn't like about the movie is that end to early!Now i'm going to read the book, definitely.",8,0,0,5 January 2020
Molly's Game," Jessica Chastain kills it.

Shutter Island," On the nature of daylight
","What to say about 'Shutter Island'?This movie is spectacular, Scorsese and DiCaprio are spectacular together and this movie proves it. Leonardo's performance is incredible, at a top level. The directing and visual effects are stunning. I loved this movie and there's a unexpected plot twist at the end. What really shines in this movie are the acting, production design, visual effects and soundtrack.AMAZING.",10,0,1,13 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," GO WATCH IT! IT'S WORTH IT.
","I just got back from the cinema where I saw a Star Wars marathon, the Skywalker trilogy. I have to say that I didn't have low or high expectations, I saw a mix of reviews (more positive than negative but not relevant); and the truth is that it is one of the best films I saw in 2019. The special effects, sound mixing, sound editing, and the score are what shine most in the movie!, the cinematography and production design were also spectacular. I saw a mix of Harry Potter and a little Endgame but executed brilliantly. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley are some of the best in cinema today and their performances are brilliant. Carrie Fisher (RIP) and other cameos did well too.What I can't understand is because there are so many disappointed fans (and some without seeing the movie), it's a good end to this stage and the Skywalker trilogy. Highly recommended for everyone and I recommend seeing it in 3D, it's worth it!",9,31,71,19 December 2019
The Godfather: Part II," One of the greatest films ever made.
","To say that this film is a sequel is a sin.
Al Pacino and Robert de Niro win the Oscar for this film, Robert de Niro's performance as Vito Corleone is perfect, every scene in which this one is perfect. Al Pacino as always perfect and unlike the first film, he is much better.PROS:EVERYTHING. The script, the direction, the cast, the performance, everything in this film is perfect and its 3 hours are worth it.CONS:NOTHING. This movie is perfect.",10,4,4,6 October 2019

Dunkirk," *CLAP CLAP CLAP*
","I mean... what a movie. This is the best war movie I've ever seen in my life, but more than a war movie, it's a survival movie.I will always love Nolan and he will always be my favourite director and writer, everything he writes and does is so unique and incomparable that you are always left with the desire to see more. In this film I didn't know what to expect from him as it was his first realistic film about war but it turned out to be the best I've seen of war in recent times.The Dunkirk evacuation, code-named Operation Dynamo, also known as the Miracle of Dunkirk, was the evacuation of Allied soldiers during World War II from the beaches and harbour of Dunkirk, in the north of France, between 26 May and 4 June 1940. The operation commenced after large numbers of Belgian, British, and French troops were cut off and surrounded by German troops during the six-week long Battle of France.This film is seen from different perspectives and you can see how war can be seen from those perspectives. There are the Fortis (flying), the ones who are going to rescue the soldiers and the people who fight on the beach. All people experience war differently and that's what I like about Nolan in this film, it shows us what each person feels and lives that you even feel like you're there.This film is very claustrophobic (at least for me) and the score of this film is incredible. Hans Zimmer shows us again because he is one of the best composers today. Cinematography is the best and so are visual effects.The cast is impressive and at the same time varied, as Nolan wanted to make this film with young actors and not very specialized. This is the fifth time that Cillian Murphy and Christopher Nolan have worked together and at the same time the third time with Hardy.Cillian Murphy is always a win.In conclusion, I recommend this film to all those who like films about war and Nolan's work. I hope the best of Nolan for TENET that I feel is going to be shocking.",10,1,2,9 October 2019
The Usual Suspects," Why Kevin Spacey was the best actor alive
","This movie is basically a puzzle, I had to watch it several times to understand it. Kevin Spacey basically steals the whole movie and deserved that Oscar. The script is amazing and very well writing (fun fact: Christopher McQuarrie used to work on a police station). The movie is well directed and the editing is very good and at the same time confused. AMAZING cast with hilarious moments.This movie is basically amazing. 10 out of 10.",10,1,1,15 December 2019
No Country for Old Men," That ending is something.
","Boy oh boy, I really was looking forward to watch this movie because I saw the flip coin scene and I fall in love with the script. The movie is amazing and a questionable ending but the cast and acting is incredible.The Coen Brothers are amazing and i'm glad the won 3 oscars that night. What a movie. Congrats Javier Bardem too, that character scared the out of me.10/10",10,1,1,21 October 2019
The Favourite," Awesome
","'The Favourite' is an incredible film; Olivia, Emma, and Rachel are awesome and the 18th century atmosphere is very well design. The script is hilarious with the dark humor and so are the performances, Yorgos directed the movie excellent.But, i don't know, it isn't a 10 for me.",9,1,3,8 January 2020
Foxcatcher," Foxcatcher
","FoxcatcherGood film, not a ten but not bad, tells a story based on real facts and the truth is that overall was very good.The performances were impressive but above all I want to emphasize the performance of Steve Carrell, that kills it, to be an actor who makes comedy and now being in a film about drama and crime is very good. Mark and Channing.In my opinion it's a good movie but it's more like a chill crime movie. Sometimes I was uncomfortable watching Steve Carrell because he was always on time but he was scary.Good film recommended",8,0,0,28 October 2019
A Quiet Place," meh but ok
","To be John Krasinski's debut as a director is not bad, I mean, it's not the best debut I saw as a director and at the same time starring in the film but come on, better than Tommy Wiseau is. I expect more from him for the sequel.Positive:Emily Blunt's performance (for God's sake, it's perfect), cinematography, soundtrack.Cons:Like all horror movies, there are 32 clichÃ©s every 5 minutes and it always starts with some death. Visual effects aren't the best thing and I didn't like them at all, but well, it was a low-budget film and what they raised wasn't bad.Conclusion:It's not the best horror movie at all but it's enjoyable in its own way.",7,1,3,7 October 2019

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," 'Life can only be understood looking backward. It must be lived forward.'
","Beautiful, beautiful and beautiful.This film is worthy, David Fincher returns with his perfect direction and an incredible script by Eric Roth. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life, at first I thought it was going to be heavy and boring for its length but the truth is that it doesn't disappoint for a minute. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are and will continue to be some of the best actors in Hollywood and in this film they prove it, the rest of the cast is perfect and the casting director has my thumbs up.This is a very exciting film, sentimental, touching and the truth is that there are many scenes that can make you cry for example the final when you see how were the last years of life of Daisy and Benjamin.Anyway, this is a movie recommended for everyone and they are going to love what every minute is worth. 10/10",10,0,0,1 November 2019
The Dark Knight," He's a silent guardian. A watchful protector. A Dark Knight.
","The Dark KnightWhat can I say about this? It was simply spectacular, Christopher Nolan again shows that he is one of the best directors of modern times, Wally Pfister (DP) continues to be leaving me with mouths open with his work. Obviously the performances of Heath, Christian, Sir Michael Caine, and Aaron Eckhart are the best. The cameo of the best of the best Cillian Murphy, and of course the soundtrack of Hans Zimmer.It is not time wasted this film, recommended to everyone.",9,0,1,28 October 2019

A Clockwork Orange," As queer as a clockwork orange
","This is my favorite movie and always will be, thanks Malcolm McDowell and Stanley Kubrick.
Alex is one of the best villains in the history of cinema, his intelligence, personality and above all, his tastes are what make him unique; he is violent, the most cultured of all characters and always finds beauty with the music of the great Ludwig Van Beethoven. The narration is impressive and unique, we always see his perspective of things and his creative imaginations.Malcolm's performance in this film I think was the best of his career and deserves recognition as it is also one of the best performances in history.The dialogue, direction and cinematography in this film is unique.Thank you Stanley Kubrick, thank you.",10,1,1,4 October 2019

Zero Dark Thirty," This is something
","Despite all the things in the movie that aren't totally accurate about what happened in real life, this is amazing. I enjoyed every second of the movie and I didn't get bored at any moment.Jessica Chastain is so good in this movie. Nothing more to say, just, watch the movie and don't read or watch anything.",10,0,3,5 January 2020
Joker," Probably one of the best Joaquin Phoenix performances
","I have no words to say, I think this is the best movie from 2019 but only because of Joaquin, you know, the concept of the film is interesting to study specially the character but its slow and the potential wasted of the film made it a bit dissapointing. I give it a 10 because Joaquin was excellent, i mean, he's the reason why everyone is going to see the movie, it you Jared Leto instead this would be one of the worst DC movies ever, and DC is a master in bad movies.The script had the word 'society' more than every movie ever made and the directing wasn't bad but not a Scorsese movie.Well, a 10 because of Joaquin but super overrated and it doesn't deserved the hype.",7,1,2,3 October 2019
Whiplash," Not quite my tempo
","I don't really know what to say about this film, is stunning.Just Kidding Simmons and Miles Teller probably give their best performances and it's a masterclass of a film from Damien Chazelle.",10,0,1,5 January 2020
It Chapter Two," Better than the first one.
","EDIT: I haven't read the book so don't kill me if I got something wrong. Peace.I had low expectations for this film and I thought the first one was going to be better but no, this one was better.Pros:-The casting in this film was very well chosen, my tens for the casting director.-Bill Hader and Jessica Chastain are the best of the movie in my opinion and if it wasn't for them or the jokes the movie would be much worse.-I liked the soundtrack quite a lot although it didn't change much from the first one.-The cameos by Stephen King and Andy Muschietti (director) were good although I was disappointed that Stephen is from Independiente and not Racing Club.Cons:-The length of the film is one of the things I hate about the film and especially if you saw it in the cinema because after 2 hours you start to hurt the tail and no longer know how to sit. The film could easily last 2 hours 20/30.-The way IT died. It seemed to me the biggest stupidity in the world that IT caused so much terror and fear to be killed by being called 'Clown'.Conclusion:IT: Chapter Two is an enjoyable movie even if your 2 hours and 50 minutes feel too much.8/10",8,1,3,6 October 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," interesting idea but...
","As a fan of Agatha Christhie's novels, I wanted this movie to shine but the only thing that shined was the mustache of Poirot. A cast full of stars but Kenneth Branagh didn't give them not even 10 minutes of screen to each of them.Besides that, the movie is interesting and fun to watch. Hope that Death on the Nile (2020) is better.",6,0,0,6 January 2020
Lord of War," There are over 550 million firearms in worldwide circulation. That's one firearm for every twelve people on the planet. The only question is: How do we arm the other 11?
","This movie centers about the rise and fall of Yuri Orlov, an arms dealer who sells to literally everyone. I've got to say this, is the best performance that I've seen of Nicolas Cage. He acts Yuri as if he were created for him. Jared Leto, Ethan Hawke and the rest of the cast are good but Nicolas kills it. The movie has a story-telling perfection, the writer/director Andrew Niccol adapted perfectly and smartly every real life conflict between the countries that appeared on the movie. But it's not all about countries, Yuri has his enemys because he isn't the only one selling arms.What is really good about this movie is the Nicolas acting, the screenplay, the cinematography and the directing. This movie should've won at least an oscar for best screenplay. I'd like to see more of stuff like this for the future because is very enjoyable",10,0,0,28 October 2019

Amy Adams is beautiful as always and I have always love her acting. Spike Jonze directed this movie very good, and the script is amazing and crazy. If you have 2 hours free, watch this movie, is worth it. What you really can see is the art desing and the set decoration, those are masterpieces, the light and colors are very well done.
