The Longest Yard," Remakes: for the ignorant
","Need I say in this review that I hate remakes, especially if the original was a classic? Nothing made today could even come close to the original Longest Yard. The only things there are to gain from a remake are self promotion and profits. Not because they love the movie, but because they want to feed off of what others love.It's all about money. After all, it's much easier remaking something that's already loved, rather than creating and inventing something from scratch and hoping everyone will like it. That is the bane of today's filmmakers, abandoning creativity and taking the shortcut to success. Now they introduce The Longest Yard to a younger, ignorant audience. Where will it end?The first scene tries and fails to capture Burt Reynold's classic Paul Crewe from the start. Not only do we see that Sandler is not worthy, but he really has no good reason to crash his girlfriend's car. Of course it is captured on CNN in a heartbeat when realistically cops these days take 20 minutes to even respond to a call unless it involves a life and death situation.The cons in the original were easy to side with and the Warden and Captain Knauer were much meaner. These 2005 cons are a bunch of lame cocky rap-listening self-absorbed jerks that reflect the 'me' athletes of today. I could not find myself rooting for these shallow inmates.Richard Kiel's original character was copied into being a big dumb bald black fool who had some of the worst lines in the movie. 'I LIKE little Michael!' WTF! The classic character of Connie Shokner was turned into some ugly big-jawed Mexican on steroids. Proof enough here that you can't imitate a classic with stupid wannabes.The gay cheerleader roles were expanded to give Tracy Morgan more air time. A convict is giving out cheeseburgers, how stupid is all this? This whole movie is like watching a WWF wrestling match with all it's brainless chest beating, suitable for rednecks with the brain of a fern. Of course, today's 'MTV kids' will love it! My god, get a life!I saw this at work off a bootleg, thank god I didn't pay for it. I mercifully turned off the DVD before the end, not caring what happened. If this is going to be the sorry result of remakes, the entertainment world is in trouble. I'll give it a 1 of 10 just to knock it lower than the overrated 6.3 rating that the ADD-riddled youngsters of today have given it.",1,18,41,10 October 2005
Fight Club," Violent, lame, Bloody, lame
","Who needs this movie? I sure don't. Looks like generation X or Y or whatever the hell they are called this week love it. I'll say this, it is the perfect movie for young troubled, bored, ignored, misunderstood, ever-changing teens who need to escape from the shadows of their predecessors and give themselves that angry identity of screw the world I'm different.Looks like some reviewers lives are so blah that they need to push the levels of taste until they are totally disgusting and morally wrong. What kind of parents do they have is my question.First of all, punching someone in the face that many times can kill them or at least send them to the dentist for free. What makes the kids of today enjoy this type of behavior, fantasy or not? A lot of shirtless men, sure that's a great reason to applaud this movie for some of the messed up women out there who keep picking violent men as boyfriends and then wonder why. I saw no redeeming value in this movie. It took me for a ride and then fooled me at the end, but if anyone rates this in their top 5, 10, whatever then I can guess their age category. Go to school, get a job, have a nice life and adjust your attitudes. I sure don't have the perfect life but obviously better than some of the messed up kids who like this because I don't need to watch people beat the s*** out of each other for entertainment. I'm shocked by the number of positive reviews for this crap. Get therapy, please.I give this movie a 3 of 10, and that's generous. It sure is not rated an 8 like the score in front reveals. Now I know overall statistics mean absolutely nothing.",3,8,22,29 September 2004
Rocky V," I waited to see it and blah
","Rocky 1 and 2 remain the best. Rocky 3 started with the ridiculous stories and writing. I waited till 1987 to see Rocky 4 and it was so-so. Rocky telling the Russians that they can change? Pretty lame, I watch it now and wince. Let's see... Rocky 5 came out in 1990 and I didn't have any interest in seeing it until it was the only thing on a week ago, 14 years later. Boy was I surprised at how bad it was, worse than I thought it would be.For one thing, I had pictured it being the end of Rocky's fighting and thought he was going to be the trainer for Tommy through the whole movie, sharing victory with Tommy through a manager's perspective as he wins in the end. Boy was I wrong. Tommy quits Rocky and joins Don King's clone. Does Sly enjoy having a big mouthed black nemesis in all his boxing flicks? Okay, 4 out of 5. And why they stick with Pauly the loser is beyond me. Rocky 5 is a testosterone overdose as Balboa ends up in a long overdrawn fist fight with Tommy in the streets as everyone watches. This time Rocky's son does the Adrian look as he watches the news showing it all on TV. I was surprised Stu Nahan wasn't there with the commentary. Rocky sounds as dumb as ever in this movie. Does all the years of leading with his head make him regressively talk even more like an illiterate idiot from New York?",2,6,10,28 July 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Star Whores - Attack of the Clowns
","There have been many bad sequels out there, Scrotum Menace and Attack of the Clowns ranks among the worst. Roll over in your graves Rocky 4 & 5, Charlies Angels Full Throttle, Jaws the Revenge, Police Acadamies, and make room for these clunkers.Lucas, since you are into nipping and tucking and doctoring your other 3 Star Wars films like Joan Rivers' plastic Surgeon, do us all a favor and totally remake these. Give us better actors, less CGI, and less material aimed at the kiddies. Some of the actors you chose are so undeserving it's pathetic.I give these newer ones a 3 out of 10 stars each. Or is it cumulative?",3,0,1,3 October 2004
Empire Records," Tries too hard to be cool...and fails
","Just saw this on a cable channel today and it's one of the worst out there. It's a 90's movie that tries too hard to be cool. It tries to tell the viewer that what these kids are doing and saying are cool - but it's not. It's datedly uncool - the girl that shaved her head to be like Sinead O'Connor - really??? Was this an attempt to be the 90's version of Fast Times at Ridgemont High? I see some similar characters, but these actors can't act, and they don't have much to do in the movie except behave like dumb shallow teenagers. Obviously before CDs became the norm, there's a few nostalgic scenes with a TDK product placement sign and shelves of cassette tapes. It reminds me of Tower Records when idiots take over. Pass on this garbage if you haven't seen it.",3,2,9,26 January 2013
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Another bad remake
","Once again, we are subjected to greed and self promotion as another classic gets copied by today's filmmakers who shamelessly abandon creativity.First of all, let me get this off my massive chest. Yes, it is a REMAKE. The original was made in 1971. The arguments about the changing of the title or that it is closer to the book have no merit. It is a COPY of the 1971 classic with the SAME characters and basic storyline. Johnny Depp's performance falls so far short of Gene Wilder's and this is obvious to everyone. Wilder's wild, eccentric, poetic, unpredictable style was superior to Depp's reclusive, socially-moronic, mumbling, flashbacking attempt. Speaking of flashbacking, was that really necessary? Christopher Lee is a fantastic actor but this is wasted on one of today's ideas of having to pick through the origin of some of the best misunderstood characters in entertainment. Why oh why do people feel the need to go back in time to see Darth Vader, the Grinch, and now Wonka's child highlights when leaving it all alone is much more mysterious?The kids......2005 Charlie looks like an imp with over sized ears. Whenever I look at him I just can't get by those bat-wings! 2005 Verucca, though cute and talented, was nowhere near as bratty as the original. Making 2005 Mike Teevee a video game freak was to be in touch with the times, the original Mike was still superior. The original Violet was more obnoxious which equals better. This new one with the win-at-all-costs mentality falls short.The CG-generated Oompa Loompas were a lame joke. Mass producing that goofy looking filipino was totally lame. Though their songs were taken from the book, I thought the Augustus one was OK but I remain faithful to the original Loompa songs which were far superior, humorous and ingenious. I also remain faithful to the original 1971 movie which filled me with magic and adventure as a child.I also remain faithful to the original in terms of grading. 2005, made for the ignorant who missed the first one, is a failure. 2 out of 10 stars.",2,18,32,10 October 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," Stay with the original
","Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions both fall short of high expectations. Actually, I really didn't know what to expect besides the return of Agent Smith. The evil agent's henchmen were all the wiser in skipping the sequels. I heard that Tank was strongly disliked by his co-stars that he was voted out of the sequel. Lucky him.In the second film, we are introduced to a bunch of new people as the citizens of Zion. Why anyone would want to live among a bunch of wanna be cool twits wearing shades is beyond me. My first impressions were that these people of Zion are just way to cool for me. Any sympathy and caring for anyone in Zion quickly went out the door. Pinkett-Smith (Will, what the hell do you see in her???) has way too much attitude for me to even take seriously. Morpheus regresses from a mysterious leader into a Zion whipping boy and has to take too many orders from too many 'chiefs' who seem to take a delight in revealing how incompetent he is. The special effects were mostly good, except that one scene where one of the rasta haired albino twins jumps on the hood of the car, that had fake written all over it. Surely they could have done that better, couldn't they? The movie had it's moments like everyone's favorite Neo vs. the 101 Smith clones but after leaving the theater I suddenly was not in a rush to see the third.Which brings me to the third. Again, I have a problem with the people of Zion and their terrible attitudes. Did someone take a dump in their Tastee Wheats? My god the leaders were a bunch of grouchy jerks. Why do they behave like such as$holes? All except the Asian guy, who is so silent and so lack of any personality that we really don't care what happens to him either. My favorite part was the train station, kind of reminded me of 'Ghost' with the subway bit. Though I didn't like the part where the Indian woman rudely tells Neo that he doesn't belong here. 'Go back to India - b--ch' should've been his response. Agent Smith goes through a personality change and suddenly Neo's cool mannered nemesis turns into a raging psychotic bloodthirsty killer. Was this change needed? Again, Zion could get whiped out entirely by the 'squiddlies' - and who cares? It's hard to be introduced to these new characters who were never in the original and have any feeling for them besides: WTF are they doing here now? Morpheus, Neo, and Trinity deserved a better fate than to be left in this ho hum city full of losers. I'll take the Matrix covered surface any day.",1,1,2,21 July 2004
War of the Worlds," The bratty kids bring this movie down
","I hate remakes. Despise them. Loathe them. 99% of them belong in the trash, because they are garbage. They're useful only to the greedy money grubbers who produce them. We don't need a retelling, especially when the original was (and still is) fantastic. This is a film that shouldn't have been remade, especially for a 3rd time. Why can't people just enjoy the originals as time pieces, rather than simply having to update them to today's standards? It's completely asinine.Okay, remake rant over. Movie rant on.A friend at work had seen this and said he liked it. In his words it felt like he 'was part of the film,' like he shared the main character's experience. Maybe not the most intellectual review, but it worked to draw me in. I'm ashamed, based on my intense hatred for remakes, that I actually went out and paid to see this.That being said, it did feel like I was experiencing an alien attack as I sat there and watched it unfold. I am not a cgi enthusiast but the effects were stunning. I thought Cruise was okay in this but Robbin's character almost stole the show. Then there were those....kids.Maybe films aren't made to be re-watched more than once, but I find myself able to do this for movies I like. Star Wars, Animal House, Road Warrior, Planet of the Apes, etc, etc...you get my drift. This movie however...I cannot watch ever again. Those kids are so unlikeable, especially the son, that I can't sit through their tirades anymore. Making this movie with a dysfunctional family was Spielberg's stab at life in the 2000's. Some other current movies also like to show angry pi$$ed off teens in the attempt to reflect the times. Well, it doesn't work for me. It would've been better if the bitter resentful son was killed off by aliens early and the daughter's mouth was duct-taped to drown out all the screaming. These factors alone brought down my rating to 3 stars of entertainment value.Also, was it explained the the aliens died from a virus at the end? A few friends who had also seen it said they didn't understand how the aliens died. I knew why because I saw the original many times.Way to screw up a great movie, Spielberg.",3,2,3,26 December 2009
Casino Royale," Royally disappointing!
","I decided to skip this new Bond movie at the box office because I did not like the way Bond movies have become. Any Bond movie after 1983 is total crap, and this series should have died a long time ago to save face.In the early part of Casino Royale there is an unbelievable chase scene. The black terrorist runs and jumps up and over, through and around, and vaulting through holes in the wall like he's Spider-man. What's even sillier is that Daniel Craig, the new Bond remake flavor of the present, follows him step for step. 20 minutes of this chase is ridiculous as this terrorist should have given Bond the slip 17 minutes ago.Judi Dench makes another dreadful appearance as M. Why was there no male M during this time? It's like the producers chose to totally ignore the fact that there was an original M at one point. Dench, who I've always hated as M, resorts to what she does best - chastising Bond throughout the movie. They first brought her in to berate Brosnan for sleeping around in a sorry attempt to bring political correctness into the franchise. 'Bond shouldn't be having limitless sex  GASP!!!' Most idiots ignore the intent  but I see through the guise and refuse to give in to the new films that support this lame idea. Dench and the lines she is given completely ruined the franchise.Back in the day there was less fuss about being a Bond Girl and more talent involved in actually being one. The newer actresses are all tickled to be considered bona fide Bond Girls, a fact that dilutes the integrity of the honor. You shut up and play a bimbo  you don't talk about what an honor it is. The honor goes to the pioneers  not the wannabe's! Hale Berry is sexy, but she is no more a Bond Girl to me than Phyllis Diller  because she takes away the mystery of the role by blabbing about how she always wanted to be one in an interview. Being a Bond Girl is better left unsaid. Let the Bond geeks decide who is worthy.The boring poker game nearly put me to sleep as the producers decided to take advantage of the newest fad that is being shown every hour of the day by ESPN. Sitting on your ass while playing cards is NOT a sport! I kept waiting for this movie to end, and it almost ended 3 times but we were given even more crap to wade through. Bond gets tortured Japanese World War II style  right in the nuts with a hard swinging rope. I'm surprised he could even bed a Bond Girl after these brutal scenes. Is that why he never had kids? And who is that stupid silent bald guy with the big pointy ears? Is he supposed to be intimidating or menacing as he stares at everyone in the villain's lair? Lame sidekicks anyone? This goon was just a nothing.I can't leave out Daniel Craig's looks  it was extremely hard for me to get around those enormous batwings he has for ears. He looks more like Charlie from the Chocolate Factory's Dad with those ears than any Bond. And those two ladies that 'check him out' as he drops off the car - PUH-lease! Why is there no Q and gadgets? Bond the text messager - wow I'm impressed. NOT! Looks like cell phones sell brand names better. Can't get that big money contract for something unproduced like an underwater car. I give this movie a 1 out of 10. While I can watch the pre-1985 Bond movies several times - this one does not warrant another viewing.",1,29,52,26 April 2008
