Catch Me If You Can," Well done
","Spielberg has taken this remarkable true story and brought it to the screen with a bit of embellishment, but not too much. The real Frank Abangale has approved the film.Top notch performances by all, and the 1960's bright colors are perfect. The clothes, the cars--if you're a baby boomer, it will make you nostalgic.In terms of mood, this one is like Spielberg's The Terminal.It's long, but you will not lose interest.Excellent throughout.",9,0,1,4 November 2019
Training Day," Keeps us interested, but the ending is silly
","Washington is phenomenal as corrupt cop Alonzo Harris. For the first half of the film, he keeps us wondering if he's a bad guy or a good guy, in spite of his unorthodox methods. He's actually seems like both. Sometimes he's charming; other times, he's outright despicable. It take a skillful actor to pull off a role like this.Ethan Hawke, as Jake Hoyt, Harris' white rookie partner on his first day as a narcotics cop, is convincing as he wrestles with his concepts of right and wrong--enforcing the law or stooping to the level of the criminals he's dealing with. Alonzo puts him through his paces, big time.The second half of the film goes into dissipation. As Alonzo's actions become increasingly over the top and corrupt, Hoyt, finds himself descending into is own kind of vigilantism. In the ending of the film, his decision to 'do the right thing' is not only misguided, but it causes Alonzo's demise. Ironic.All through the film, I kept wondering how these two cowboys got away with all this stuff without any other cops or their superior officers knowing about it. Pretty hard to swallow. There's one brief scene with Alonzo having lunch with some high ranking police officials who are clearly indifferent to the law, but it's not enough to answer the question of why the two cops are completely unsupervised.The film is fast moving and captivating and will keep you watching, but the final scenes descend into a typical violent Hollywood shootout that rivals Bonnie and Clyde. This movie could have had a better ending. It just 'drops dead,' if you'll pardon the expression. And it doesn't answer the moral question that it raised in the first place. If the middle had been cut shorter, there could have been a better resolution at the end. What became of Hoyt? What about the investigation of the shootout? We get nothing but death and final credits.Still, it's worth a watch for two good performances, excellent camera work, and the questions it raises about police ethics (or lack of them).",6,1,3,5 October 2019
L.A. Confidential," Holds up well after 22 years
","This film was the big sensation of 1997. Re-watching it 22 years later with more of a jaundiced eye, I have to say that it still holds up pretty well._LA Confiedntial_ replicates 50's noir cinema successfully, except that it's in color (but it's very 50's looking color, a nice detail), and it includes the requisite 90's nudity, profanity, and violence that was forbidden in those movies. A lot of the dialogue sounds like it came from a 50's _Dragnet_ episode, but that's appropriate.The performances by Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Danny DeVito, and James Cromwell, as well as most of the supporting cast, are convincing. I'm leaving out Kim Basinger, who plays a blonde bimbo (every 50's noir movie has to have one) who is not greatly integral to the story, just there for sex appeal. Let's face it: She didn't get famous because of her brilliant acting.I can't help but wonder if, in the 50's, all cops beat witnesses and suspects and stuck pistols in their mouths to get information. I'm sure it happened at times, but in this film, it's the norm. Hollywood embellishment, perhaps. I haven't read James Ellroy's novel, so I can't really say. But bad guys are bad guys, and it's fun to watch them get their asses kicked.The multiple plots intertwine without confusing the viewer, and they come together nicely.The entire agenda of the film is about exploring the sleaze, political corruption, and immorality that lies beneath the superficiality and glamour of L.A. That is exactly what noir writers like Chandler, Hammett and others were all about. In various ways, this film pays respect to them all.With all of its affectations, this film is like watching a cartoon. But a damn good one.",9,1,2,12 October 2019
Knowing," What a mess!
","_Knowing_ is a confusing mashup of science fiction, astrophysics, eschatology, prophecy--and, oh yeah, aliens with blonde Guy Fieri haircuts wearing
trench coats.It's also a disaster and an apocalypse film, although the special effects look like something out of a video game.It borrows from _Independence Day_ , _ Close Encounters of the Third Kind_ and a dozen others.Plus, we get to witness Nicholas Cage saying, 'How am I supposed to stop the end of the world?' I'm sorry, but Cage just doesn't do serious well.The ending, although intended to be hopeful, is inexplicable. The whole damn movie is inexplicable. What's with the black stones the aliens keep handing everybody? Why are the aliens affecting the brains of children but not adults? Why does virtually every male movie protagonist have to be a widower whose wife died in an accident? Why would a Hollywood studio spend $50 million on such a preposterous movie?The answers are unknowable. Even more unknowable is why I watched it to the end. I guess I was somewhat entertained and wanted to give my brain a two hour break.Roger Ebert gave this film 4 stars, the max. What was he thinking?",4,1,1,10 October 2019
Non-Stop," Totally silly, but you'll keep watching
","This film has zero plausibility. However, it's so well done, and Liam Neeson is so good, you'll watch it to the end.It's a nerve-wracking thriller popcorn movie, abundant with Hollywood silliness. But you'll get your money's worth.",7,0,0,4 May 2020
Drive," Pretentious garbage
","I'm losing respect for a lot of movie critics. I watched _Drive_ after seeing the 90th percentile Tomatometer ratings and reading a dozen gushing, obsequious reviews about its brilliant acting, cinematography, and atmosphere. I was not rewarded.
_Drive_ is basically a grade B slasher movie pretending to be an art house film. It starts out with an intriguing car chase and a potential developing romance, but in the second half, it degenerates into a repulsive gore fest that undermines any and all viewer credibility.
A lot of people think violence in films can be artistic. Directors like Peckinpah and Tarantino have made millions from it. Nicholas Refn is clearly trying to join the club. We get to witness a man getting a fork stuck in his eye, a knife jammed into a man's throat, and a man getting his head stomped until his head implodes like a pumpkin. Oh yeah, they're all bad guys, but are you having fun watching this? Please explain why. Sorry, folks; its just gratuitous, bloody crap.Ryan Gosling's acting consists almost entirely of staring at people with a toothpick in his mouth. Yes, laconic leading men can be interesting--Clint Eastwood, Bruce Willis, et al. Not here.
It's also shameful to see the great Albert Brooks, who built his career on creativity and comic wit, taking a role as a nasty criminal scumbag. It just doesn't work.Carey Mulligan is not the least bit impressive as the love interest. Other than the fact that she's cute and has a cute kid, there is no plausible reason why Gosling's Driver should fall in love with her. Her character is a cardboard cut out.To make matters worse, we're subjected to insipid techno-pop music on the soundtrack, including a song in the last scene about 'heroes,' which was apparently written about Sully Sullenberger, the airline pilot who saved 155 lives by landing his plane in the Hudson River. This does not compute. Sully was not a violent murderer.Some movies are bad, but they're still well-intentioned, amusing, and entertaining. _Drive_ is just plain bad. There's nothing well-intentioned about it. It's inhumane, gratuitous, pretentious, and nausea-inducing. Do yourself a favor and avoid this one .",2,3,11,15 October 2019
Children of Men," Great story, great filmmaking
","Children of Men grabs you by the neck and keeps you watching through a harrowing hour and 40 minutes. It's evocative of Orwell's 1984, with a bit of Terry Gilliam's Brazil (sans the humor).Based on the 1992 book by P.D. James, the story takes place in a dystopian 2027 Great Britain in which fertility has vanished from the human race. There are no babies or children, and the youngest person on the planet, age 18, has just been killed. All the major cities in the world except London have been decimated. The streets of London are battle-torn--terrorists, warring factions, the military--and it's barely safe to walk down the street.
At the same time, illegal immigrants are being rounded up and put in pens like animals (sound familiar in 2019?).Miraculously, a young woman turns up pregnant, and various political factions want her and her baby. Theo Faron (Clive Owen), a London white collar worker, is contacted by his ex-wife (Julian (Julianne Moore) to help the young woman escape the war-torn country and find safe haven on a ship called Tomorrow.Very little is explained in this film; it's all about the escape. Along the way, we meet Theo's friend Jasper (Michael Caine in a phenomenal performance) and several other characters who assist him (or turn out to be betrayers).The cinematography is astounding, with many long, uninterrupted shots, ala Hitchcock. I'm having a hard time thinking of a movie that has better camera work. You can't avert your eyes.The plot is somewhat elusive, with very little backstory, but director Alfonso Cuaron has wisely chosen to make this a visceral rather than a 'logical' film. He succeeds in captivating us.This is one of the best films of 2006, with a high budget ($76 million), but it lost money because it was not well-promoted. Too far over the average Hollywood-brainwashed moviegoers' heads, I suppose.Quit watching mainstream Hollywood garbage and seek out gems like this one. You will be rewarded.",9,2,3,9 November 2019
The Shape of Water," You have to admit that it's unforgettable
","Visually, this film reminded me somewhat of Terry Gilliam's _Brazil_. Everything looks dated, elaborately cockeyed, and surrealistic. It's a feast for the eyes.Content-wise, the film is rich in metaphor. The negative reviewers obviously have no taste for magic realism, a rich Latin American tradition that Guillermo Del Toro has brought to the movie screen. These same reviewers probably hate the authors Marquez and Borges--or they would if they had ever read anything other than People magazine.Yes, there is a bit of sex and violence. Being somewhat puritanical, I flinched a couple of times, but none of it was salacious or overdone. Del Toro does what he does. The film is his vision, and I respect that.There is really no way to describe this film. It obviously evokes Beauty and the Beast, but it goes way beyond that. Open minded folks and those who appreciate grand cinema will put on their 'best movies' list.The performances by Hawkins, Shannon, Jenkins, Spencer, and Doug Jones as the creature are unforgettable. You can tell when actors know they're participating in something great.",9,0,5,26 February 2020
Heat," Contrived and cliched
","I guess I'm one of the half dozen people in the world who didn't see 'Heat' when it came out. I read all the gushing critical reviews, but I just never got around to it.Watching it 24 years after its release, it struck me as contrived and cliched, with dialogue that sounds like something out of a bad 1940's gangster movie ('The cops are all over me like a cheap suit.' One guy actually says this! And there many other cringe-worthy lines).The cops and crooks are all alpha males; the women are all brainless bimbos--especially DeNiro's girlfriend who, in spite of being a normal 'civilian,' decides to stick with him even after she discovers that's he's a thief and a murderer. This is after about two dates. Good choice, lady.To make matters worse, the movie is interminable: two hours and 49 minutes.There's plenty of automatic weapons fire, scores of wrecked vehicles, and many gallons of blood, if you like that kind of thing.Everyone at the time of the film's release was all hyped to see DeNiro and Pacino together as a bad guy and a cop, but to me, there is no chemistry. The one scene in which they meet in a restaurant and talk is promising, but it falls flat. They recite their lines and try to make it convincing, but that particular moment in the film made me realize how little investment they had in these roles. Just two big time actors collecting their paychecks.Just another Hollywood blockbuster with pretensions of greatness. Meh. It passes the time, nearly three very long hours of it.",4,2,6,20 October 2019
