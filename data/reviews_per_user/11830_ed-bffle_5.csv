Insidious: Chapter 2," Very entertaining
","For being PG-13, this movie was very good. It was funny, witty, suspenseful, and I thought the acting was fantastic. I was even moved at one point, almost tearing up. I personally loved the story--you can simply read the summary because I don't want to give anything away. At first it didn't make much sense but as the movie continued, different secrets unfolded and it was far easier to understand. The special effects were great as well and there were SO many pop outs! Sometimes in film they get tiresome, but I was always jumping with every clang and slam. It was a rather original concept and very well done in my opinion. I have yet to see a truly scary movie but this is by far one of the best I have seen.",7,2,4,19 September 2013
Requiem for a Dream," A beautiful, haunting film
","When I first began watching this I thought it was really strange and hard to follow. To be honest, it's like that for the entire movie. The filming was artistic and new, yet disturbing and unsettling. Overall, this movie is extremely dark. It's definitely not for an immature audience, nor is it for those who dislike sad stories. Oddly, I was painfully satisfied with the end--though I will not share the conclusion. The content is very explicit throughout, from sex scenes to brutality, but I didn't find any of it to be excessively unnecessary. Jared Leto does a fantastic job, along with Jennifer Connelly, Ellen Burstyn, and Marlon Wayans. (It was really weird to see a Wayans brother in such a dramatic film! Nonetheless, he did very well.) I still feel numb from the music that was constantly played, and I will never forget it.",9,1,2,19 August 2013
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Beautiful.
","I just watched this movie for the first time. At first I thought it looked like some cliché high school movie. Of course, twenty and nearly-30-yr-olds play teens, which is rather unrealistic. (I'm still in high school and NO ONE has that nice of a complexion!) I continued to watch as Charlie, played by Logan Lerman, struggles to find friends. I also thought that was silly because this guy is very handsome and he definitely WOULD have friends, even if they'd only use him for his looks. So far, it seems like I hated it. Well, Emma Watson and some other dude befriend Charlie and from then on, the story bursts with passion, confusion, secrets, lust, and a wonderfully brilliant message about 'misfit' teens. I cried at least 3 times throughout this-- granted, I was very exhausted today--but it contained honest humor and emotional connections. I would have given this a 10/10, but 'White Chicks' takes first place. Either way, this movie is incredible and I recommend to everyone.",5,1,1,29 July 2013
Mr. Nobody," Loved It
","I finally had the opportunity to watch this incredible film where Jared Leto, once again, amazed me with his great acting abilities. Though I'm not usually one for the sci-fi genre, this movie was different in that it was exciting, sad, romantic, and REAL. The word 'real' is very relative, but I feel it's appropriate here: Every individual character had a purpose, no matter how much they actually showed up in the movie. Leto's character development was absolutely beautiful and, as usual, his emotional connection was spot-on. The artistic aspect—both in the script and scene editing—is phenomenal as well. I would suggest this to people who like strange and inspirational plot lines with many unexpected twists and turns. To sum it up, it was great.",9,4,6,5 May 2014
Schindler's List," Disturbing, incredible, but...
","I thought this movie was insanely wonderful. It was horrifically accurate and painfully real. The actors were all phenomenal. However, for being a movie about one of the most tragic events in history, there was too much sex. Granted, there wasn't actually a lot, but the unnecessary female nudity of Schindler's sexual partners was a tad distracting. I was hoping to watch a GOOD movie without any need to show women's bodies in a sexual manner. Besides that, it is really amazing and I recommend it to anyone who loves a heartbreaking yet eye-opening movie. Please don't get angry with me for being an arrogant feminist who 'doesn't understand the moral', because I certainly do. It just made me uncomfortable. Although not extremely gruesome, the violence is unforgettable and shocking at times. Still an excellent film.",9,15,24,26 July 2013
