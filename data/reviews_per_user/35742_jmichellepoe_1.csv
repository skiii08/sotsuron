Marie Antoinette," Too Much of the Same Thing
","I saw this film because I am obsessed with French history as well as the art of France. I have a strong background in the French Revolution as well as pre Revolutionary times during the Burbon Monarchy. I think this may be the reason why I didn't care for the film that much. I think she focused too much on the same topic over and over again throughout the entire film... She woke up and got dressed like 3 or four times ate with the king, partied excessively, and did what she did over and over in the movie and the film ends where it really should have began or at least been in the middle of the film when they take the two of them from Versailles to Paris. It was extremely disappointing for me! I don't think the film spent enough time focusing on the state of France during her reign nor her husband really. Most of the film I thought was historically accurate, but could have been elaborated on so much more and still been appropriate for the audience it was intended for, however I thought the ending was where it really started to pick up. I think had we the audience really understood what the state of France was like and how Louis XVI contributed to that we would have connected more so with Marie Antoinette or at least understood her better-- if that makes sense. What I did like about this film was that it very 'hip and trendy' good music a nice mixture of modern music with classical music. The costume design was opulent and I appreciate that more than anything. I think it's important for younger generations to get in touch with the arts and history and this film if anything does accomplish that very, very well. I think it could have been better, but kudos on those two things right there. If you don't mind an OK script and eh... ending then go see this film strictly for the costumes, music, and direction of photography. Absolutely beautiful...",5,2,5,20 October 2006
