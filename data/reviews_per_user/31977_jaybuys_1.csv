The Devil's Advocate," Worth seeing for Pacino
","Pacino, Pacino, Pacino. This man is a brilliant actor and his performance in this film is nothing less than stellar.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the film's other stars Reeves, and Theron.With a cool script and some nice cinematography and effects, this film is definatley worth seeing.  I've seen it multiple times and I enjoy it, I just wish it had a better cast to compliment Pacino as Keanu and Charlize are almost grating at times.  Would've worked better with other actors.7/10",7,0,1,14 September 2001
