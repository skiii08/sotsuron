The King's Speech," Unaccustomed as I am...
","King George VI had a stammer. In the days before broadcast media, this wouldn't have mattered much since kings were rarely heard by more than a small number of their subjects. Once radio, and, later, newsreels with sound and (horrors!) television came on the scene, a monarch's ability to inspire confidence by speaking clearly and authoritatively became paramount.Step forward, then, Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue, approached by George's wife, the woman we all now know as the Queen Mum. She is desperate, almost ready to give up – George already has – and he is a last resort, but he it is who helps the Duke, who in time becomes King, get a handle on that stammer.The difference he makes is aptly illustrated here with two speeches at either end of this splendid film. At the beginning, as Prince Albert, Duke of York, 'George' has to give a speech to close the 1925 British Empire Exhibition that is an ordeal for him as speaker and for the crowd as listeners. But at the end, after an uneven, even stormy, set of meetings with Logue, he makes a thoroughly creditable job, as King and Emperor, of addressing the Empire now at war with Germany. Hokey to end on a note like that? Perhaps – but, in a film of this quality, who cares?The film wins hands down on its performances. Colin Firth as Albert/George is mesmerizing; in the scene where he is telling Logue about the death of his afflicted brother, Prince John, I could not have looked away if someone had held a gun to my head and ordered me to.Colin Firth is, however, merely the first among equals. Geoffrey Rush is nearly as good with a quirky performance as Lionel Logue and Helena Bonham-Carter as Elizabeth, first Duchess of York, then Queen Consort to George VI, is both irritating and excellent. The supporting cast is well up to standard, particularly Michael Gambon who has a minor role as George V; the scene where, with his death looming, that King is too confused to understand what his advisers are telling him is another that stays with the viewer long after it is shown.Less good are Guy Pearce as a rather forced Edward VIII (his 'British' accent is dreadful, but fortunately we don't hear much of it) and Timothy Spall, whose effort at Winston Churchill seems strained at times.Production values are sound. There isn't much music – appropriate in a film where how one of the characters speaks is the main business of the plot – but what there is is well used. The proceedings, sometimes amusing and sometimes moving, rarely drag. I came out at the end both uplifted and moved.Rating: 9/10 - a truly excellent piece of work.",9,4,8,12 January 2011
The Monuments Men," Men Seeking Monuments
","This is an interesting little film, telling the story of a team of artists, art historians, and so on, sent to try to rescue works of art pillaged by the Nazis in the European part of World War 2.As is often the case with Hollywood films, the role played by non- Americans is downplayed. A token Brit and Frenchman are included, but when the time comes to kill someone off, guess which two bite the dust.That said, the film is well cast and the main actors (all men apart from Cate Blanchett) work well together. A nice casting touch is putting George Clooney's father, Nick, as an older version of the same character as George Clooney himself plays, but in a codicil set in the 1970s, long after the main business of the film is over.The script has its moments and the music is excellent. The whole thing ends on a pleasing note of triumph. Yes, much that was fine and good was indeed lost. But so much that might have been lost was not, thanks to the effort made by people like the ones we see here. In the film, President Truman is shown asking whether it was worth it – a very pertinent question. The Clooney character gives an equally pertinent answer – yes, it was.So, to sum up, this is an unexpectedly charming and absorbing piece of entertainment – maybe a bit light for its subject matter, but a mostly enjoyable couple of hours.Rating: 7/10",7,2,3,30 August 2015
Shaun of the Dead," Gory, but has a certain charm!
","Minor British pictures quite often turn out to be little gems and here's another contribution to that fine tradition.Simon Pegg turns in an assured performance as the hapless Shaun, a loser in a dead-end job who knows how to hang on to useless friends, like Ed (nauseatingly well played by Nick Frost), but can't keep his attractive girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) because he can't manage a simple thing like reserving a restaurant table. Then he really finds himself as London is subjected to a plague of zombies.Difficult to fault any of the performances in this film and the soundtrack is well judged, but the main pleasures are in the visual gags and some superb one liners. My favorite among the former were the early scenes showing the deadening nature of Shaun's everyday life and a later scene where Shaun's party, seeking to find refuge at a local pub, encounter a party led by his ex-girlfriend. The groups are mirror images and greet each other as if they were at a vicarage tea party!The ending works well, though some may find it tasteless. It is at least consistent with the rest.Recommended, unless you're put off by gore or strong language. Rating: 7/10.",7,1,2,3 March 2005
Argo," Overrated
","I finally got to see this film when it came out on DVD. And my question, having done so, is: just what is all the fuss about?I was still a callow youth when the actual events on which the movie is supposedly based happened, but I remember feeling really sorry for those taken hostage. But that's the problem with this film. I really didn't feel any connection at all with the 6 people shown being hidden in Iran by the Canadians, before being taken out under fake identities. The scene on the Swissair flight when it becomes clear they have actually got out is nice, but no more. Most objectionable is the politics, with American heroism and ingenuity being talked up, the role of the Canadians being reduced to a supporting act, and the British, who also helped, not being mentioned at all.There are some plus points. The acting is mostly good. The climactic scene as the Iranian authorities chase a jumbo jet along the runway at Tehran airport is fictitious and implausible, but exciting all the same. The music is effective. When all's said and done, though, the film just doesn't deserve the awards it won– but, to be fair, I wouldn't give it any Razzies either.Rating: 6/10",6,8,10,28 July 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Not really a Star Trek film
","As a Star Trek fan of long standing, I went to see the 2009 reboot of the film franchise with some trepidation. But in fact I thoroughly enjoyed it, partly because it held a surprise and had the guts to stick with it.And so, to this year's effort. There are many things to like about it. The performances are mostly good. Benedict Cumberbatch is a striking villain, while Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto do a good job of the reversed Spock/Kirk death scene. It is not slow or boring, and the script has some fun moments.Special effects were good, but that's a given these days. I saw it in 3D, but that didn't seem to add much.I don't remember much about the music, so it was presumably neither good nor bad.But the film just isn't Star Trek, when all is said and done. It is, rather, an action film a la Total Recall with some Star Trek characters and overtones bolted on. It would have been just as possible to make this film with a wholly non-ST cast and a different spaceship.I enjoyed it on that action-film level, but, as a Star Trek film, it is a disappointment. Rating: 6/10.",6,17,36,11 May 2013
Finding Nemo," Lovely
","In years to come, the period from 1989 onward (starting with 'The Little Mermaid') will probably be regarded as a golden age of animation. At the end of this offering, you have to ask yourself, where can animation go from here? I don't know, but I bet that someone at Pixar does.In the meantime, this is a breathtaking job of film-making. The animation is astonishing - the underwater effects are so convincing that, at times, I found myself wishing for a wetsuit. Add to this a clever script, glorious music, and perfect voicing - Ellen DeGeneres, of all people, deserves special mention and I loved Geoffrey Rush's stint as a pelican - and the result is a rather special movie experience.Is there a flaw? Well, maybe it's a bit on the long side for an animated feature.Strongly recommended nevertheless. Rating: 9/10.",9,0,1,6 January 2004
Alexander," Another Classical Disappointment (Spoilers)
","It was with some reluctance that I went to see this movie, but I let myself be persuaded. I should have listened to my instincts.The best to be said about this is that it's better than the ghastly 'Troy' from earlier this year. Also, I was pleased to see it deal, however hesitantly, with the vexed question of Alexander the Great's eclectic sexuality.The first 80 minutes aren't bad and include an excellent battle scene. Unfortunately, the thing then grinds to a halt, with the audience being left to drown in a sea of pompous speechifying (the climactic speech by Alexander in India is particularly excruciating), dull photography, unmemorable music and creaky acting. The least bad performance was that of Jared Leto as Hephaistion, Alexander's male love interest. It's best to draw a discreet veil over the rest of them, including Colin Farrell in the title role.If you haven't seen this already, my advice is that you wait until the DVD comes out. After this year's efforts, it will, with any luck, be a long time before any hot shot director finds it necessary to mutilate another tale from classical history.Rating: 5/10 - all of those five awarded for the first 80 minutes.",5,0,1,3 December 2004
The Others," Good points, bad points
","An excellent performance from Nicole Kidman, plenty of suspense and some good shock moments are the mainstays of this intriguing film. Unfortunately, there probably isn't enough suspense (or story) to fully sustain a film of this length and the ending is rather easy. That said, there's a fair degree of fun to be had along the way and I left the cinema satisfied that my $6 ticket money had been well spent.",7,0,0,20 August 2001
Troy," A terrible disappointment (some spoilers)
","Apart from his excellent turn in 'Twelve Monkeys', I've never rated Brad Pitt as much of an actor and his reliably terrible performance in 'Troy' bears much of the blame for this movie's weak impact. But I did hope the presence of such stalwarts as Brendan Gleeson, Brian Cox and Peter O'Toole might give us something to hang on to. The task, however, proved beyond them. What we're left with is a story where the inability of one prince (Paris, played in dreadfully limp, self-righteous fashion by Orlando Bloom) to keep his hormones under control leads to an avoidable war, thousands of deaths and the destruction of a city and its culture. The rather murkily presented spectacle of a thousand ships taking to sea on a quest for revenge forms little more than background to some massive egos and the actual fall of the city is presented almost as an afterthought. The music is eminently forgettable.To give what little credit is due, Peter O'Toole does turn in a strong and sympathetic performance as King Priam, while Sean Bean is credible, even interesting, in the role of Odysseus. Their efforts, however, are not enough to save the film.It would have been more honest to call the movie 'Achilles' and have done with it. If you must see this one, wait until it comes out on rental.Rating: 3/10",3,44,91,16 June 2004
Ed Wood," A Delight
","Thank goodness this movie has recently been reissued on DVD. If you missed this gem first time around, see it now! Most movie buffs, both serious and frivolous, have heard of Edward D. Wood Jr. If you're lucky, you've seen one or more of his films. They are so bad that they're entrancing, especially his masterpiece 'Plan 9 from Outer Space'.In making a film of Wood's career, it would have been very easy to just point the finger and laugh. There is a little of this in 'Ed Wood', but, for the most part, the film chooses to examine and celebrate rather than mock.The casting is inspired. Martin Landau's performance as Bela Lugosi has been widely and justly praised, but Johnny Depp deserves similar credit for an engagingly irritating effort in the title role. The support cast is excellent, with Bill Murray and Mike Starr (who has the best line in the movie) deserving special mention.As for the script, it bristles with brilliant one-liners. Music is unobtrusive and appropriate. The black-and-white photography aptly captures the atmosphere, both of Wood's own films and of the time when they were made.Strongly recommended then. Rating: 8/10.",8,0,0,5 January 2005
Orphan," Some good, some bad
","I'm a horror film fan of long standing, but there haven't been many good ones of late. So I went to see 'Orphan' with a rather jaded feeling of trepidation.The film partly succeeded in providing a pleasant surprise. It had some genuinely scary moments, I didn't see the solution coming until we were presented with it, and Isabelle Fuhrman's performance was a masterpiece of creepy menace.The real problem is with the adults. There is a desperate lack of originality or even plausibility in their characters. John (Peter Sarsgaard) as the father displays a touching, but utterly moronic, faith in his adopted daughter, to the extent of believing and trusting her rather than his other children or his wife (Kate, played by Vera Farmiga). Kate starts off the same, but at least sees the light eventually. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for her therapist, Doctor Browning (Margo Martindale), an 'expert' who is taken in right from the start and whose only skill is in mouthing the most cretinous platitudes and clichés; if the decision rested with me, this doctor would be struck off.The action, however, is well staged, taking place mostly in an ultra-modern house and a tree house, both providing plenty of corners where villains can lurk and high places where innocents can be trapped or from which they can be pushedA mixed bag then – flawed, but worth seeing.Rating: 5/10.",5,4,8,10 August 2009
Final Destination 2," Ludicrously entertaining (spoilers)
","The first 'Final Destination' movie took an intriguing concept, assembled an attractive cast to realize it, and forged ahead with gusto and its tongue planted firmly in its cheek. The result, aided by an ingenious script, was a highly entertaining film - sometimes funny, sometimes scary, sometimes just good. But it was a concept that could only really stand one examination.The second film is a step too far. Once again, we see an interesting cast playing characters who are slaughtered in various imaginative ways. But at least two of the death scenarios really labor the point to the extent that, by an hour into the film, I was laughing too hard to have any energy left to suspend disbelief.Not wholly unentertaining for all that, but only see this if you've nothing else to watch. Rating: 5/10.",5,2,2,28 July 2003
"Monsters, Inc."," Charming
","A fair effort this. The animation is great and the voicing well done. I can't grade it as high as 'Shrek', however, as the story, while entertaining for kids, doesn't offer their parents much. The music too is distinctly unmemorable. But I did coo at the nice bits and was charmed for much of the way. So it can't be bad! Rating: 7/10.",7,0,1,8 February 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Good, but Looooong! (one spoiler)
","In some ways, this film suffers from the same flaws as the book. Though the producers do (thank goodness!) cut out the ridiculous Tom Bombadil episode, the story meanders and there are too many scenes where you're left wondering what they were for.With that gripe out of the way, it has to be said that the acting and characterization are great, the music is fine and the special effects are simply awesome.At the end, though, I was vaguely dissatisfied, very much aware that I'd watched a long film. A truly great film wouldn't leave that feeling.Maybe parts 2 and 3 will do better. Rating: 7/10.",8,0,0,25 March 2002
28 Weeks Later," Disappointing Sequel
","Danny Boyle's 2002 film '28 Days Later' was a startling and terrifying piece of work, combining interesting characters with a chilling situation and amazing photography, and taking care to provide something at least slightly upbeat for the audience to take home at the end. In other words, what it did, it did well.'28 Weeks Later' is not the worst sequel I've ever seen, but it is something of a disappointment. To begin with the good, it does inherit some of the strong points of the first film as an interesting cast turns in good performances to give us some pretty scary moments.Unfortunately, it just does not know where to stop. The plentiful, but rarely excessive, gore of the first film turns into seemingly unstoppable fountains of the stuff here. A charming scene near the end where a helicopter is used to slice a group of 'infected' to pieces is particularly nauseating. Meanwhile, characters we like are shown dying horrible deaths to no good purpose, and the ending is a real downer. To add to the fun, half the dialog seems to consist of words beginning with 'F'. Perhaps no surprise, given the material, but at times the expletives really do seem to be just padding. The memorable soundtrack of the first film is nowhere to be found here.So, I neither recommend this film, nor advise against going to see it. But if you do go, keep your expectations in check.Rating: 6/10.",6,0,1,11 November 2007
The Village," Satisfactory
","Maybe I've seen too many movies like this. I'd worked out what the catch would be very early on and watching the rest of the movie was simply a case of proving I was right and adding some details.That said, the movie works rather well. Though nothing very much actually happens (until the last 20 minutes or so), the film sustains a pleasurably uncomfortable level of tension for most of its length. In this, it is helped by a splendid performance from Bryce Dallas Howard. The supporting cast, containing such worthies as Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt, is also excellent. Only Joaquin Phoenix seems strangely disengaged; however, his character barely appears in the last portion of the film, so this doesn't spoil things too much.The photography was OK and I enjoyed listening to the dialog, framed as it was in the English of the late 19th century. The music, however, was sometimes intrusive; there are times in all movies when music just isn't necessary, a fact the film makers here seemed not to realize.One to watch nonetheless. Something of a leap of faith is required, but it's worth the trouble.Rating: 7/10.",7,0,1,5 August 2005
The Patriot," The old black and white movies were truer to life than this
","An awful central performance is the mainstay of this hackneyed, cliche-ridden garbage. The ridiculous story, simplistic characterization, and poor staging don't help either. It was hardly worth the trouble of watching all the way to the end, since I knew ten minutes after the start what the conclusion would be. Rating: 2/10.",2,3,6,28 November 2001
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Surprisingly good
","I must admit that, when I heard they were making a 'Hollywood' version of the Swedish film of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, I groaned. Another original ruined. Though the trailer looked promising and Daniel Craig struck me as ideal for the male lead, I settled down to watch it with some reserve. No need. In many respects, it is a substantial improvement. The acting is better, the sets somehow work better, and the soundtrack is appropriate. Best of all, however, is that they stick closely to the original plot, including the very end, which, for some reason, the Swedish version missed off.Those who have read the book and seen the original film will know that they both include some rather graphic scenes of sexual violence. Since the English-speaking peoples tend to be a bit more prudish about these things than the Swedes, I had been curious to see how they would be handled. The answer is, not badly. Though the worst of the violence is not shown, we are left in no doubt about what's happening. Even better, one crucial scene, where Lisbeth turns the tables on her tormentor, is shown more or less in full. Daniel Craig's performance as Blomqvist is excellent, but he is not alone. Rooney Mara is a revelation as Lisbeth. Both are given sterling support by Stellan Skarsgard, Christopher Plummer, and an array of other performers. They handle the well-scripted dialog with conviction; I particularly enjoyed the exchange between Blomqvist and Lisbeth about the string of Bible-related murders, which shows the girl whose disappearance Blomqvist was called in to investigate is just part of a much bigger, nastier picture. Such trimming as was made was mostly well judged. In the original, the disappeared girl is found in Australia, but here they settle for London, merging her fate with her sister's. The legal case Blomqvist was involved with when we first see him is not omitted, but its importance is reduced, removing something I felt was a bit of a distraction in the book and the Swedish film. A very creditable job all round then. Having seen all three Swedish films, I'm now actually looking forward to the remaining English-language remakes.Rating: A pleased 8/10.",8,2,6,16 May 2012
The Butterfly Effect," Surprisingly worth the trouble (spoilers)
","This film requires a leap of faith by the audience, but it's worth the trouble. The reward is an absorbing story, involving characters we can care about.It's not worth going into the illogic and paradoxes in time travel movies. Such considerations hang over all time travel movies, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't be made.A big surprise here is the quality of Ashton Kutcher's performance. I found him convincing and not unmoving as Evan, a man who finds that by revisiting the memories recorded in his journals, he can change the events they recall (and even ones they don't). It probably helps that Kutcher is surrounded by a competent group of actors who flesh out their own characters, and the story, admirably.The script is a bit, er, frank at times and some scenes are rather gory. I didn't find these overdone, however. The special effects are adequate rather than inspired, and the music is negligible.But you watch films like this for the story, and that works. The result is a satisfying, but not great, movie experience.Rating: 7/10.",7,0,1,12 July 2004
Mamma Mia!," A fun nostalgia trip
","It must have been fun to make this film. It was certainly fun to watch it.The story is easily summed up. A young woman is about to get married and wants her father to give her away at the wedding. Trouble is, given her mother's colorful past, she does not know who he is and, having secretly read her mother's diary, she invites the three most likely candidates to the Greek island where she helps her unsuspecting mom run a hotel and where the wedding is to take place. High jinks ensue!This is a simple story, of course, but more than adequate for its main function  to act as a framework for a selection of ABBA's songs to be performed by a cast not known for its singing prowess.The performances are mostly fine. The female leads and two of the males make a decent stab at singing. The exception is Pierce Brosnan. Him, they really should have dubbed. The choreography ranges from exciting to hilarious (in a good way), with the 'Voulez Vous' and 'Does Your Mother Know?' numbers deserving special mention. The setting is great.For people of my age then (don't ask!), this is a thoroughly enjoyable nostalgia trip. It helps if you like (or liked) ABBA and/or have seen the stage show.Rating: 8/10 and a bucketful of smiles.",8,1,4,12 March 2009
28 Days Later...," Chilling (Spoilers)
","Very few movies have ever genuinely frightened me. 'Natural Born Killers' was an exception, and '28 Days Later' is another. If anything, viewing it again recently on DVD had even more impact.Maybe my having spent a lot of time in Britain had something to do with it. During the breathtaking opening scenes set in a seemingly deserted London, I kept picturing the situation that would have led to that. Seeing the main characters trying to survive and come to terms with what had happened, I kept imagining how I would behave in the same situation. Any film that can stir that kind of response has to be worth the price of admission.The characterization is one of the main strengths of the movie, but there are others. Music is used sparingly, but effectively. The use of digital video gives the pictures a pleasingly gritty look, in tune with what we're seeing. Violence is not shied away from, but only portrayed as and when necessary - and is used by the good guys as well as the bad.The original theatrical ending is a bit conventional; the alternative, provided on the DVD, is colder and more hopeless, but more effective. The 20-second time limit - once a person is infected with the rage virus, you have, at most, 20 seconds to kill them before they turn on you - might seem a bit arbitrary, but leads to two scenes of startling emotional impact. The second of these drew a unanimous cry of 'Oh no!' from the audience in the theater where I first saw the movie.Recommended then, but not for the squeamish. Rating: 8/10.",8,0,1,6 November 2003
2012," One of the laziest films I have ever seen
","I always try to begin my film commentaries with something positive, so let's start here by saying the special effects are magnificent. Unfortunately, that should be a given these days, so it doesn't count for much in the movie's favor.In every other respect, except financially, this movie is an abject failure. The story is basically a rerun of the same director's (much more entertaining) 'The Day After Tomorrow', with another disaster, general environmental disintegration, replacing the new ice age of that earlier effort.This might not matter too much if the story were well handled, peopled with engaging/plausible characters, or well acted, but it is none of those things. Instead, we have a number of cardboard cutouts going through the motions of interaction, using worldwide catastrophe as an opportunity to work out their personal issues by babbling the most jaded of clichés.The most infuriating of these scenarios is between the trio of our 'hero' Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), his estranged wife Kate (Amanda Peet) and her new man Gordon (Tom McCarthy). Jackson redeems himself in Kate's eyes with heroics of the kind towards which he has previously shown no inclination. Gordon is then conveniently killed off and, seemingly, completely forgotten within minutes. A pity really because at least McCarthy seemed to be making an effort. Cusack in particular barely seems to be awake much of the time and Peet is just plain dreadful.The only actor who emerges more or less unscathed from this mess is Woody Harrelson. His comic turn as a kind of apocalyptic shock jock, killed while watching the Yellowstone caldera erupt as a giant volcano, breathes some much needed life into the early scenes.I haven't mentioned the music, but it isn't really worth mentioning. All in all, then, it looks like Roland Emmerich just called up the script for 'The Day After Tomorrow' on his computer, changed a couple of the selections, then filmed whatever came out. The result is awful to contemplate.Rating: 2/10.",2,4,7,25 November 2009
The Lives of Others," Strong Characters, Great Performances
","The Stasi existed to protect the Communist state of East Germany from its perceived enemies both external and internal. That state is long gone, as are the Stasi, yet their existence still chills and fascinates.Step forward Florian Henckel Von Donnersmarck with this drama of Georg Dreymann (Sebastian Koch), an East German playwright put under the surveillance of a superkeen Stasi officer, partly at the behest of a government minister who covets Dreymann's actress girlfriend (Martina Gedeck) and who would be grateful if the playwright were got out of the way to give him a clear run at the woman. Unfortunately for the libidinous minister, however, things do not quite go according to his plan.This film's strengths are many - plausible story, subtle and appropriate music, suitably drab sets and camera-work  but it is the performances that really captivate. Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck are excellent, but Ulrich Mühe is simply flawless. We watch as his character, Stasi Captain Gerd Wiesler, makes the transition from unquestioning zealot to sympathetic collaborator who realizes at last that the system he has believed in all his life crushes those who do not fit in with it. It crushes him too, eventually, but in a noble cause that leads to a worthy end and an unexpectedly touching conclusion.I am lucky enough to have sufficient grasp of German to watch this in the original, but, even if you can't, this one will grip you from start to finish. It is a deserving winner of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year in 2007 and is strongly recommended.Rating: 9/10",9,3,3,4 March 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Well...
","... it looks like I'm going to have consign myself to the minority here and state that I was seriously disappointed with this movie. Not that it was actually bad, but there were some very weighty flaws that left me squirming in exasperation.Where to begin? Well, it DRAGGED - oh, how it dragged! The first one did too (though it works better on DVD), but this one topped it. There were pointless changes to the characterization from the novel and the effects were very variable, though the Gollum character was brilliantly realized.I left the cinema at the end feeling even more cheated than with the first installment. I'll probably buy the DVD when it's issued, in the hope that the movie flows better in that medium, as the first one did. It needs to.Rating: 6/10.",6,0,0,31 March 2003
The Mist," Generally mediocre, but what an ending!
","Another review arising from a spontaneous DVD purchase of a film based on a Stephen King story.Some have compared this to John Carpenter's 1980 effort 'The Fog', which I liked, though many didn't. The broad outlines are similar  a small American waterfront town is engulfed by a mysterious mist/fog and a group of figures, some heroic, battles for survival against the hideous monsters the mist/fog conceals.Carpenter's film is wholly supernatural, but this story has a  sort of  scientific explanation, which, it must be said, only partly works. A selection of stock characters whose types we know from other King stories  religious nut, skeptic who won't believe anything even when his nose is rubbed in it, various rednecks and lowlifes, manly hero  are added to the brew.The monsters work best when we don't see them clearly  when they are spectral figures looming through the eponymous mist. Seen close up, they just look silly. The performances are no better than satisfactory, with the exceptions of Marcia Gay Harden, whose religious loony is enjoyably nauseating, the always reliable Frances Sternhagen in a small role, and Toby Jones as the apparently timid supermarket employee who shows a surprising strength when the chips are down. Script and music are adequate.With all this and a rather routine roll of gory killings, this might have ranked as just another mediocre film version of a Stephen King work. But then come the closing ten minutes. The conclusion simply left me gaping at the screen. It is savage and the dreadful irony of what has happened is possibly the most frightening thing about the whole film.Rating: 7/10, of which at least 2 come from the ending alone.",7,4,9,4 February 2009
I Am Legend," Some weaknesses, but well worth seeing
","I have not read the Richard Matheson novel on which this is based, so cannot comment on any deviations between the two.From the point of view of enjoying the film, however, this doesn't matter much. Will Smith turns in an excellent and convincing performance as Robert Neville, a military doctor living in fortified solitude on Manhattan. Neville believes himself to be the last real human left alive after a devastating plague arising from a genetically modified version of the measles virus developed, as we see in a short prologue, by a cancer specialist as a cure for that affliction.Also on the island are various animals and some other humans who have mutated rather than died from the virus. Their sole aim is to kill anyone not like them, but they cannot stand UV light, so cannot come out during the day.The sequences set in a deserted New York owe more than a little to the equivalent scenes set in London that were part of what made Danny Boyle's chilling 2002 effort '28 Days Later' so effective. Unlike that film, however, we see flashbacks (including the prologue, which shows an interview with the cancer specialist, played with eerie smugness by Emma Thompson) that tell us how things got this way.Apart from a rather pat ending, the film is remarkable for its hopelessness. Neville is reduced to conversing with shop dummies and viewing recordings of old news shows. It is when he starts expecting them to answer that we realize the effect all of this is having on his mind.Camera work and music are satisfactory rather than inspired and the CGI effects for the mutants are less than convincing. The atmosphere is great though and sterling work from Smith makes this a movie well worth the price of admission.Recommended. Rating: 8/10.",8,1,3,15 January 2008
The Piano," One of the Most Overrated Movies of All Time
","What with all the hype that greeted this movie on its release, why should I have been surprised that it ended up being such a major disappointment?The best thing to say about it is that at least Ada (played by Holly Hunter) doesn't get to say anything. The script is bad enough anyway and is used to frame a group of characters who are all obnoxious, stupid, or both. The plot has nowhere in particular to go until it reaches a conclusion that is both nasty and contrived.Add to that muddy photography and stunningly unmemorable music and you have a movie experience it's worth traveling miles to avoid.Rating: 2/10.",2,14,28,18 May 2005
Paranormal Activity," Excellent Suspense Piece
","Engagingly played by the young leads, this 'Blair Witch'-type project delivers the goods in convincing fashion. There are not that many shock moments, but a slow buildup of suspense starts almost at once until, by the end, this viewer at least shared in the characters' apparent discomfort.For me, a nice aspect of this was that I did not see the resolution coming until a minute or two before the film showed it. That doesn't happen often these days.The absence of music added to the tension and the film did not go on too long. Two more plus points! All in all, then, a very worthwhile effort.Rating: 7/10.",7,0,1,8 December 2009
Avatar," Not bad, but should have been a lot better
","I haven't seen many films in 3-D since it became newly fashionable. This was the first, and best.The film's technical credentials are so awesome that I'll begin with them. Visually, the film is simply stunning (in 2-D and on Blu-Ray too). Our hero, Jake Sully, is linked to an avatar so that he can penetrate and explore pristine forest on the alien world of Pandora and persuade the native people to move, thus allowing mineral companies in to exploit the planet, some of which is, of course, sacred.He ends up lost in the forest and it is from that moment that the film's stunning visuals really take hold. The light is haunting and the forest's animal and insect inhabitants look truly alive.Accompanying the visuals is some of the loveliest film music I have heard in a long time – maybe since 'Gladiator'. It is haunting when it needs to be, uplifting when it needs to be, sad when it needs to be – at all times, adding to the magic of what we're seeing. I don't buy film music much these days, but this CD was playing in my car the same day I saw the film.Unfortunately, the story has nothing much to recommend it. As I was watching it, I thought ''Dances With Wolves' in Outer Space', a description that seems to have occurred to others too. 'Avatar' contains every cliché and ill-informed prejudice – primitives good, civilization bad – that Kevin Costner's earlier film contained and is just as crass in showing the effect they have on each other. To that extent, it might as well have been made in monochrome. A correspondingly average script doesn't give the actors much to work with and their performances are no better than satisfactory.But it's worth seeing AND hearing all the same. Think I'll watch it again this weekendRating: 7/10.",7,1,4,24 January 2012
How to Train Your Dragon," A Very Nice Film
","This movie has so much going for it that I'm almost ashamed I didn't like it more.As is nearly always the case these days, the animation is splendid. Add to that, mostly plausible, if rather routine, characters, good voice acting, and excellent music and you're on to a winner.Well, almost. Unfortunately, the story, while very pleasant, is pure template (boy befriends cute animal he should be killing and wins over skeptical father and friends - puh-lease!) and the climactic battle scene goes on way too long.But I'm smiling as I write this, which can't be bad - can it? Rating: 6/10.",6,2,8,29 September 2010
War of the Worlds," Pass the clichés
","The best thing about this film is that, though transferred from 19th century London to the US East Coast in the 21st century, it does otherwise at least try to follow H.G. Wells' original fairly closely. For example, the invading aliens use tripods as their fighting machines and there is a fairly lengthy scene in which the lead character (not named in the story but called Ray Ferrier here) is trapped in a cellar with a madman (played, with obvious relish, by Tim Robbins).Unfortunately, in his attempt to inject human interest into the story, Steven Spielberg opts for a set of main characters so clichéd that even Lifetime would be embarrassed to portray them. Ray (Tom Cruise) is our hero, a flawed man and neglectful father whom his wife (Mirando Otto) has renounced in favor of Tim (David Alan Basche), a clean-cut, responsible sort who takes care of her and the two children she has by Ray. Tim, effete rich guy that he is, virtually disappears (of course) when the crisis hits while Ray emerges as strong, loving and caring, taking calamity as an opportunity to redeem himself with his children. Can anyone say 'soap opera'? The special effects, particularly early on, are pretty good, but the music is absolutely forgettable. Meanwhile, the attacking aliens are never actually stated to be Martians, a fact obvious in the original story and that the 1953 film made a point of right from the start, and their reasons for attacking are never identified ('envy' is mentioned, but why do they feel envious?) leaving the film seriously adrift.Dakota Fanning, as Ray's daughter Rachel, is an irritating, glib brat who screams too much! Meanwhile, Morgan Freeman, as the narrator at the beginning and end of the action, sounds half-asleep - perhaps understandably.In all, this is a pretty unsatisfactory movie experience, inferior to the 1953 version and something of a step back for Spielberg. Except financially, of course.Rating: 4/10.",4,1,1,14 July 2006
Ice Age," What a surprise
","Reading the reviews of this film, I was skeptical that it was something I would enjoy. The plot is indeed rather contrived, but the film has a charm that won me over completely. The animation, while hardly realistic, is nevertheless convincing. The voicing is great and the main characters just perfect (Diego was my personal favorite). Good music too. Rating: a rather surprised 8/10!",8,2,3,14 January 2003
"Hail, Caesar!"," Hail and Hearty
","George Clooney isn't an actor I rate particularly high, but, when he puts his mind to it, he really can act. His great performance in 'Good Night and Good Luck' was one example. And here we have another.The movie is set in the 1950s when, of course, the US was in the grip of McCarthyism. Clooney plays Baird Whitlock, an empty headed star of epic films. He is kidnapped by radicals who demand a ransom of $100,000. Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is the studio heavy who has to sort this out, while handling pretty boy cowboy star Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) who has been cast (OK, miscast) in a costume drama, fending off gossip columnists, considering a lucrative job offer, dealing with a pregnant starlet, and so on. On top of all that he's trying to quit smoking.I wonder whether it's easier for actors to play actors playing a part than it is to just play the part. The performances are, in fact, a real strength of this movie. Clooney is engagingly irritating and Brolin turns in a surprisingly sympathetic performance for such a heavy character. I also liked Tilda Swinton in a dual role as two sisters who are rival gossip columnists!The film captures the magic of 50s movies rather well. Scenes from the various movies being made as the story progresses are shown, including a rousing song & dance number called 'No Dames' featuring Channing Tatum. When Whitlock is able to return to work, we get a scene that is set at the Crucifixion and gives Whitlock a chance to deliver a monologue that carries real power – until he forgets his lines!The music is excellent too. So, all in all, a pleasant, undemanding film experience.Rating: 7/10.",7,0,2,13 February 2017
The Shawshank Redemption," Cinema at its very best
","Once again, a DVD purchase gives me an excuse to write about a film I first saw years ago - and, by happy chance, it's a truly magnificent piece of work.Stephen King's work, itself uneven in quality, also has a spotty history when transferred to the screen, whether in the form of a movie or a TV drama. Neither version of 'The Shining' was very good, while 'The Stand' was converted into a TV drama that flowed better than the novel itself, but was unable wholly to overcome or conceal that book's very real flaws.This film is based on King's short story 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption' - a good story that makes a superb film. It DOES drag somewhat in places, but what else can you expect in a film describing events that stretch over decades, but are confined to a very small physical space? For the rest, the acting is flawless, the music is subtle and appropriate, while the photography and script are both excellent. I particularly liked the characterization and portrayal of relationships - not just the Robbins-Freeman interaction, but also the other characters, even the minor ones, who cross our field of vision as the film progresses.There are a number of enjoyable high points and thought-provoking low points along the way - not too many, that would destroy the film's main impact - and the conclusion rates as one of the most gratifying I've ever seen in a movie. In short, unless you demand lots of action of the explosions and chases type, you're going to be enthralled by this one.Rating: 10/10 - the only film I've seen so far to deserve this rating.",10,0,1,5 December 2003
Centurion," Actually pretty enjoyable
","Despite a rather corny ending, negligible music and gore that is, at times, gratuitous rather than helpful or horrifying, Neil Marshall has reason to feel well pleased with this effort.Its main strengths lie in the performances, characters, and script. Michael Fassbender has really come into his own the last couple of years and he turns in another strong performance as Quintus Dias, the eponymous centurion left to pick up the pieces after the IX Legion is decimated in what is now Scotland and its general is captured.Among those 'pieces' are the strong, earthy Bothos (great performance from David Morrissey), the Numidian Macros (Noel Clarke) and the villainous Thax (JJ Feild). The interaction between them and others is never less than gripping. Meanwhile, the plot moves along briskly, leaving us little time to draw breath. I don't think I looked at my watch once.Much as I'd love to quote from the better-than-average script, the examples that struck me are, let's say, rather basic. Hear that script for yourself - it's well worth it.Rating: 7/10 (if IMDb allowed halves, it would be 7.5 out of ten)",7,10,21,28 April 2010
Prometheus," Not Quite A Great Film
","The camera pans across a primeval landscape and over wild water as portentous music plays. Then we see a spacecraft hovering over that landscape. Sort of human-looking beings, dressed in cowled garments (like monks) trek across the landscape to the water. One of them drinks something and it clearly doesn't agree with him since he dissolves, and the residue falls into the water. It was this, we subsequently learn, that kicked off that part of evolution on Earth that produced the human race. Now, in the year 2089, an expedition is crossing space to investigate a barren planet that is, it seems, where these beings came from. They left behind artifacts and cave paintings on Earth so that we would know they wanted us to come. Of course, things turn out not to be as simple as that!Though that quick introduction might make this film sound rather clichéd, it isn't really. There are exciting sequences, awe inspiring ones, amusing ones – everything, in fact, you'd need for great entertainment. Unfortunately, it's stretched over too much time so that the third quarter of the film loses its footing a bit, degenerating into the kind of chase and shoot'em up that was all there was to the third Alien film.It does find its way again though, to give as a thrilling and thought-provoking conclusion. The acting is a definite strength of this film. Charlize Theron, Noomi Rapace, and Idris Elba tackle their parts with gusto, but what really anchors it is a startlingly good performance from Michael Fassbender as the android David. Though he seems friendly and courteous, there is an air of somewhat chilly reserve about him that means we can never quite trust him. Should we? Watch and see!The music is excellent, matching the mostly convincing, even stirring, special effects, and the great camera-work.Rating: 7/10 (15 minutes shorter and it would have been 8/10)",7,0,4,22 October 2016
The Woman in Black," A Pale Ghost
","I don't think there is any medium now that this remarkable work by Susan Hill has not covered. The first version I saw was the very good 1989 TV film starring Adrian Rawlins. Since then, I have seen the excellent, genuinely scary stage play in London and read the book.Now we have a film version, with Daniel Radcliffe venturing outside the world of Harry Potter to play Arthur Kipps, a young, widowed lawyer sent to the wilds of rural England by his employer to break up the estate of Mrs Drablow, a recently deceased client.She, of course, lived in a spooky old house out on an isolated island. And it is here that two quite long, eerily effective passages take place as our hero sees the titular character and experiences various other weird phenomena while alone in the house.Meanwhile, all is not well on the mainland either, with children dying right and left and Kipps given a distinctly chilly reception.The problem with material like this is that, in our materialistic, rational, cynical age, to many it will seem rather silly. When I first saw it, I really wasn't sure what to make of it, in part because the very last scene succumbs to the film industry's eternal weakness – maudlin sentimentality. The acting, however, is mostly good. Daniel Radcliffe isn't bad at all, though his performance is so restrained that at times I wanted to shout at him to wake up. Atmosphere is well created and handled, supported by agreeably creepy music that is never overdone. The locations work too and the camera work is great.But, despite all this, the overall effect is oddly pallid. It was definitely worth trying and nobody is really at fault, but the stage version is still the one that works best for me.Rating: 6/10.",6,0,0,26 November 2012
Shrek," A Delight
","I was a little reluctant to watch this film. So much had been said of how good it was and how real its animation was, I feared it would spoil memories of classics like 'Snow White' and 'Sleeping Beauty', and be anticlimactic to boot. But I needn't have worried. The animation is indeed 'real', but the atmosphere of fantasy is not adversely affected. As for the rest, the story is exhilarating, the voicing just perfect, and the music appropriate and catchy. All in all, a great movie experience. Rating: 9/10",9,0,0,23 January 2002
Vanilla Sky," Good effort, but too long
","What is about some film makers that makes them want to go on and on, even when they've run out of plot? This failing wrecked the, in any case, poor 'Artificial Intelligence: AI' and spoils this, otherwise much better, movie. A shame really, because, up to the last half hour, we can enjoy a story that is absorbing and well acted, if rather convoluted. It reaches a point where we could leave the cinema with a pleasurable feeling of mystery. But no, the film goes on to explain every little thing. Not necessary, folks, not necessary. Rating: 6/10",6,0,0,5 March 2002
Signs," Remarkable
","This is indeed an extraordinary film. On screen, not all that much happens, but the movie is so successful in creating atmosphere and relationships and then watching them develop that I was gripped for the hour and 40 minutes or so that it was on. Excellent attention to detail helps too. The acting, however, is no better than adequate and the ending is rather weak. We've had our fun by then though, so these problems don't spoil things too much. Recommended. Rating: 8/10.",8,0,1,3 September 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Best of the three (spoilers)
","It's been a couple of weeks now since I saw this film and it has faded more in my memory than a truly impressive movie would have.That said, this is the best of the LOTR screen trilogy. In the first two parts, particularly the second, changes were made to the plot and characterization that seemed pointless and added nothing to the story - indeed, they sometimes detracted from it.Here, the changes work better and, with the bit of extra length, the film flows better from beginning to end. Despite being rather long, the central battle scene does not drag and smaller scenes, such as Aragorn's coronation, are mostly given just the right emphasis and screen time. The special effects, of course, are awesome.Minus points: The ending is ridiculously protracted, especially the PAINFUL scene at the Gray Havens. The acting too is very variable: Elijah Wood just doesn't quite click this time as Frodo and Sean Astin's superlative performance as Sam can only partly make up for this. The music too is not very memorable.So, a less than perfect conclusion to a trilogy that has thrilled in some ways and disappointed in others. But it took guts to take on such a monumental task and Peter Jackson et al deserve high praise for the degree of success they did manage to achieve.Rating: 8/10.",Null,0,0,11 February 2004
Moon," Slow to start, but ultimately gripping
","The plot of this excellent movie is easy to sum up. Sam Rockwell plays Sam Bell, apparently a technician nearing the end of a three-year assignment at a mining operation on the far side of the moon. His only real company is the operation's talking computer, nicknamed Gerty. One day, he is involved in an accident on the surface, wakes up in the infirmary - and that's when the story really gets going.There's not much to say about the cast since it basically consists of 98% Sam Rockwell and 2% everyone else. Rockwell handles the challenge of playing the same person twice for much of the film with aplomb, being alternately irritating and sober. The scene where one of his incarnations is bopping to pop music while the other is trying to talk to him about their situation is great. The talker resolves it in the best way possible, short of bloodshed! I think it may have been a mistake, however, to have a well known actor (Kevin Spacey) voicing Gerty. Such things work better – for me, anyway – if someone less well known, preferably kept anonymous, does the job. Then I am listening to what the voice says rather than the voice itself.In these days of CGI and other hi-tech gizmos, the clunky special effects portraying the lunar surface (loved that starry sky) had a certain nostalgic charm. But the sets were great, with just the right combination of technical sophistication mixed with wear and tear.Watching this reminded me of Noah Kadner's high-quality, but depressing, short film 'Today's Life'. Luckily, though similar in theme and temperament, this piece kept the quality, but avoided the depression.Rating: 8/10",8,2,3,11 August 2009
Gladiator," Looks Great on DVD
","I recently purchased this movie on DVD and it reminded me, if I needed reminding, what a great film it is. Its strengths are obvious - excellent acting, including memorable performances from Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and Oliver Reed, an absorbing story, superb music, and interesting photography. The latter was not to everybody's taste, nor were the scenes in Elysium, but I thought both worked rather well, lending texture to what we were watching. The movie is not the most original ever made, but does most other things so well, it can be forgiven for that. Recommended. Rating: 8/10.",8,0,0,14 March 2003
Contact," Excellent and Credible
","The plot development of 'Contact' is rather pat, but otherwise it's hard to fault this film. A startlingly good performance from Jodie Foster is the central pillar of a movie experience that also benefits from an excellent score, good special effects, a clever script and one particularly heart-stopping moment. To be honest, it's better than the novel that inspired it. Recommended.",8,1,3,19 October 2001
V for Vendetta," Strange and Compelling
","I was hesitant about seeing this film at the time of its release - the reviews, after all, were very mixed. But I did pick it up on cheap DVD recently, and glad I am that I did.The film is set in Britain of the future, a fascist dictatorship under the control of 'High Chancellor Sutler' (John Hurt) who seized his chance when the US collapsed into civil war to play on people's fears and establish himself in more or less absolute power.The 'V' of the title refers to a figure wearing a Guy Fawkes mask who turns up at an opportune moment, to rescue the heroine, Evey, who is about to be assaulted by three of the thuggish Fingermen, a kind of auxiliary police force about as unlike the traditional British bobby as it is possible to imagine.The film has many pleasures. Splendid performances from pretty well everybody - particular praise should go to Hugo Weaving, who never shows his face and must act using only speech and body language - a witty script and good use of music all combine well. Its topicality, in these days of the 'War on Terror', is also to its advantage.It is never boring, but often moving. The only thing that spoils it for me is the rather silly fireworks display that blew up the Houses of Parliament. Some might find the result gratifying, but the overall effect was childish.A film well worth seeing nonetheless. Rating: 7/10",7,0,1,5 January 2009
