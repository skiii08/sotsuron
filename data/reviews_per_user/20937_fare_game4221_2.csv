Skyfall," A cast away from the traditional Bond movie structure?
","Seeing it top the box office in its first week and hearing the great reviews on the movie by professionals and magazines, and the admiration at the newly designed, subtle yet powerfully alluring poster - I had high expectations for this third film - and yet I was kind of let down.As the movie began I was engaged immediately as the Bond that we all know began his daring mission. I was engaged in action of the movie, astounded by the feats he enacted, and I was impressed and in awe at the style and the coolness (achieved in the past two movies also) which Bond portrayed in his daily activities - that being jumping onto trains, or being shot at or...whatever else that Bond gets up to.However, after the first hour or so I felt that the typical Bond movie stereotype (espionage, the roles of the seductive lady counter part, the action scenes etc. etc.) were slowly becoming more infrequent. The espionage was still there - of course. But the Bond story could have taken many different turns to make it a much more audience engaging story line - like Silva, his evil part seemed to end rather quickly like the whole 5 names every week thing died quickly, you only got to glance at his high tech computers and glimpse at the power that they had. Another thing that I thought was rather strange for a Bond film was the lady. The seductive lady, which Bond is, of course, attracted to immediately (his fatal flaw) meets him in an instance then dies the next day... she comes and goes like the bullets that he fires out of his gun. Shouldn't the plot, likening to the past movies, kind of follow this fatal flaw of his which ultimate leads to her death (or departure) in the end...? Another little bit which I thought very 'un-Bond' like was the skyfall scene. It is not like Bond to reside in a house waiting for the enemies to come, setting out traps for easy switch on kill-streaks. No, he's supposed to be getting out there on hands and knees and punching the living daylights out of the bad guys.I rated it a six due to its not fulfilling my expectations of that typical Bond movie. Is that what the director was trying to achieve? to be different from the rest - who knows, but it didn't tickle my fancy. The six stars I award to it goes for the great beginning scenes and the brilliant acting by all cast members - they pulled it off smoothly and effortlessly.",Null,8,13,6 December 2012
The Bourne Legacy," Just below the mark
","This movie was more a miss than hit.(NOTE: I haven't watched the previous Bourne Series so I'm only basing it on what I have seen and understood in this movie.)The movie started off like any 'interesting' movie would - with the usual question 'who's that 'unknown' guy in the wilderness and what's he got to do with that secret organisation' that would be usually answered through subtle hints etc. - and it made me feel intrigued but then... as the movie progressed past the intro credits and 20 min later and even into the next hour, the questions still kept coming full throttle ~ 'who is he really?', 'what are those pills he is taking?' (that wasn't even answered until half way through the movie!), 'why are they shutting the operation down - because of some video...w-what?', 'what was the point of the wolves?'(am i looking too deep into that part - I dunno), 'what is the plan 'against' the company now that they've spent the last bloody 2 1/2 hours running?' - these are just a small proportion of the questions that bombarded me while sitting in the cinema.Okay so I make it sound like it was a non-conclusive movie (it kinda was) but it wasn't all that bad. It definitely did not lack on any of those impressive, way over the top (american/hollywood) stunt scenes (and my did that motorbike chase go on for ever) - sarcasm too prominent?From the above, the plot/ progression of the movie was lacking in details. But the actors managed to make it quite bearable. Personally I didn't really like Jeremy Renner in his previous works but I must admit that he actually grew on me. His easy, cool charm and acting style managed to bring some life to the rather empty script/plot. Weisz didn't do that bad a job either. So - she played the science chick to the best of her ability (and quite well too) - but outside the lab she seemed a little clumsy (clearly not an action heroine - motorbike scene... hilarious in all her clumsiness)- but maybe that fits the whole science geek stereotype (?) but she complimented Renner well - you definitely need someone weak to make the impressive big guy look even bigger! =PThe ending of the movie was annoying as it solved nothing really - well okay so they managed to escape, I mean that seemed like the entirety of the plot with, of course,the gun shooting and the crazy motorbike chases where the other guy ( question: was he supposed to be like another crazy drugged up machine/man?) would always come back just when they think that they were free... <ul><li>there was so much happening that the plot kind of got lost in between those shacks and crowded streets.</li></ul>Okay so my review is a bit jumpy but hey, nothing is perfect (am I right Mr Bourne Legacy?)Finally: Story: 4 ~ Characters:5 ~ Acting: 7.5 ~ Music: (too caught up in everything else to really pay attention - my bad!) ~ Re-watch value: Low to medium ~ Enjoyment: 6.5 ~ Overall: 6/10",Null,1,4,4 September 2012
