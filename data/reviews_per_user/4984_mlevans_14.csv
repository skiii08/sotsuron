The Blair Witch Project," A good evening's entertainment
","After intending to see this one for years, I finally did. What had put me off before were all the horror stories-not of witches, but of people running out of the theatre to puke, due to the jerky camera movements. As it turns out, I probably wouldn't have noticed this at all, had I not been looking for it. (Note: I now see, on an IMDb link that this same factor apparently didn't carry over very badly onto video.)What I did find was an intriguingly simple tale of horror. I assume most earthlings know the basic plot-as I have for years before seeing it: Three college (I assume) students making a class documentary on a supposedly haunted woods near a small Maryland town disappear, their video footage being found a year later. I have heard people berate this as being as simply and cheaply made as the type of school documentary it portrays. Some have called it a total waste of time. I fail to grasp their viewpoint.Actually there was a fair amount I did NOT know about the movie-even after watching it. (Thank goodness for the IMDb!) I admit I was a tad freaked out when I saw that the actors all played characters with their own names. Also surprising was that virtually the entire dialogue was adlibbed and that the three cast members knew very little of what was going to be happening to them. It was more a case of improvising and reacting than true acting. Yet it worked marvelously. (I enjoyed the note that Heather Donahue supposedly carried a knife with her out of concern for sharing a tent with two strange guys.) I had always laughed at the `stupid kids' who spread rumors that this was a REAL documentary. Now I see that the producers actually claimed it WAS real when it was first promoted! (Hence, I suppose, the reason for using the actors' real names.)Certainly the movie awoke Hollywood to a realization that big budget, CGI and multi-million dollar directors are not always the answer when seeking a crowd-pleaser. Eeriness, tension, pathos and a good story are all put together for basically the equivalent of a year's salary for many of us. Less was definitely more for Daniel Myrick, Eduardo Sanchez and Gregg Hale and his castaways.",Null,0,1,27 June 2003
Ali," The boxing scenes are brilliant
","Watching `Ali' was certainly an educational experience. I came on the boxing scene just as Ali was making his comeback in the early 1970s, losing to Joe Frazier and then stunning champion George Foreman in Zaire.Muhammad Ali had a charisma that was hard to understand  especially learning how militant he seemed to be, according to the film. In a rural, white, conservative military family, one would not think a loud-mouthed, draft-dodging black Muslim would be the household's favorite boxer. Yet Ali was. Ali remains my all-time favorite fighter. In fact, I largely lost interest in the sport after his retirement  along with the end of public television broadcasting matches.Veteran writer/director Michael Mann puts together an interesting look at Ali, from just prior to his first heavyweight championship fight with Sonny Liston in 1964, to his stunning victory over Foreman in 1974. The highlights of the film are definitely the boxing sequences. Filming a fictitious boxing match is difficult enough; emulating an historic one is nearly impossible. Mann and star Will Smith and his opponents pull it off, though. Smith captures Ali's trademark dancing style (Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee) and makes each fight extremely believable. About the only thing missing from a fight scene was in the Joe Frazier fight. In one of his first fights back after his suspension, Ali faced the champion and suffered a broken jaw early in the fight. He managed to go the distance, in one of the most gutsy performances of recent decades, losing a decision to Frazier. The injury is never mentioned in the film.I now understand how black audiences must have felt for generations, watching virtually all-white movies. Other than Howard Cosell (captured perfectly by Jon Voight), about the only white character is trainer Angelo Dundee, whose role is trivialized to virtually nothing. This is an interesting film with a unique perspective. Malcolm X, considered by a great many Americans of the past 2-3 generations to have been a dangerously bad egg, is portrayed in a rosy hew. Family man, loyal friend, concerned activist, misunderstood Islamic disciple, he seems about as dangerous or intimidating as Floyd the Barber. Somehow I think Malcolm got some major benefit of the doubt, here.It is also a bit disconcerting that by glorifying Malcolm, the film likewise belittles Dr. Martin Luther King and the rest of the peaceful Civil Rights movement. This, we seem to be told, is for little old ladies and Uncle Toms. I wonder if Ali really felt this way in real life.Smith's conversion from Cassius Clay to Ali, though, is most interesting and is something I had never really read much about. I always had the idea that the `conscientious objector' defense was what he had used from the beginning of the draft issue and that he had been sincere in not wanting to fight because of his spiritual beliefs. According to Mann's Ali, the draft is just another form of racism and Ali is simply not going along with it.Ali himself gets fairly even treatment. Seen as a sensitive man who cares about his people and who feels loyalty to his friends, he nevertheless proves to have weaknesses as a husband. I suppose feminists would have protested had this aspect of his personality been glossed over.While Smith doesn't look much like Ali  with an occasional exception from time to tome, others are frighteningly realistic. Mario Van Peebles is a dead ringer for Malcolm X. Voight is a perfect Cosell  obnoxious on the air & a loyal and caring friend off. James Toney bears a resemblance to Joe Frazier, while Michael Bentt, Charles Shufford and Vincent Cook look just like Sonny Liston, George Foreman and Jerry Quarry respectively.Overall, this is a good film. White, middle class America and black Christian America may squirm a bit, in between fight sequences. I suppose that was one intention. The boxing scenes make this one that everyone can enjoy at least part of. Overall, this film goes the distance.",Null,0,1,4 July 2002
12 Angry Men," A true black & white classic
","Like 'Sunset Blvd,' 'Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?' and many other B & W classics, this is one film that could NOT have been made in color -- at least not with the same effect.In fact, it is unlikely that Hollywood would even TRY to stage a movie today in a locked room with 12 individuals spending 2-3 hours together to hash out a trial verdict. Yet Sidney Lumet managed to take this simple plot and produce an enduring and endearing movie for the ages.Henry Fonda, Jack Klugman and great veteran character actors like Lee J. Cobb, Jack Warden, Ed Begley, Martin Balsam & E.G. Marshall make a wonderful array of living, breathing Everyman jurors. (And pipsqueak John Fielder -- Mr. Peterson on 'The Bob Newhart Show' -- is an excellent foil to the bullying Cobb and Begley when he builds up his nerve!) The pace is steady and gradually builds to a climax without any of the Hollywoodish melodrama some 1940s & 1950s films had.Maybe the best thing about the film is the wonderful black & white cinematography. Some of the close-ups of Fonda & especially the old man (Juror # 9) are downright eerie.This is the kind of film and the type of performance that made Fonda what he was. This is a memorable triumph of mid-20th century Hollywood.",Null,1,2,13 December 2001
Elizabeth," European History 101 was never so sexy!
","Not being an Elizabethan scholar, I cannot particularly vouch for the historic accuracy of Shekhar Kapur's `Elizabeth.' After seeing his rendering of the subject, though, I am half tempted to change fields of emphasis as I continue pursuing my MA in history!SPOILERS AHEADCate Blanchett brings the legendary 16th century monarch to life. Only in the closing scene do we see the stoic, white-faced `virgin queen' of the history books. Blanchett takes Elizabeth from a relatively carefree teenage princess on a country estate, to the hardened sovereign, firmly in control of her country and her own fate. In between she displays a wide range of skills, portraying Elizabeth's coming of age in this period of treachery, tricky alliances and fear.While Kapur's Elizabeth later shows her legendary mettle, as well as the hardness of heart to lead a nation in such a time period, she is a real woman. Blanchett's disarming, yet provocative laugh, her brilliant and uncut red hair and her burning gaze bridge the cap between trepid paintings of the monarch and the reputation she had early in her reign as a beauty. Blanchett indeed brings sex appeal, as well as humanity to the role and one cannot help pulling for the naïve, attractive teen to survive among the many perils waiting to ensnarl her.Always persuasive and quick on her feet - and in this case on her knees - Elizabeth is able to convince her half-sister, Queen Mary I (Kathy Burke) to spare her, when she is accused of heresy and treason. She also has a queenly dignity and commanding presence - even before assuming the throne, as when walking through the angry crowd of Catholic `wolves,' as Mary calls them. Her successful appearance before the English bishops early in her reign is wonderfully captured, as her dignity, poise, sense of humor and determination (along with half a dozen of the most ardent bishops being locked in a dungeon during the meeting, unknown to the queen) wins the day.Once she ascends to the throne, Elizabeth faces a whole new set of problems. Which advisors should she trust and what shall she do about her sizzling love affair with Lord Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester (Joseph Fiennes)? On one hand, venerable Sir William Cecil (Richard Attenborough) offers cautious advise, but is steadfastly loyal. The Duke of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston) is another matter. The devious duke is courting both the Spanish and the French and covets the throne himself. Meanwhile, Sir Francis Walsingham returns from exile to essentially act as the queen's body guard. In the end, he becomes her most trusted advisor.Again, it is harder to judge the film, not having the background knowledge I would have on many historical subjects. It was certainly a time of palace intrigue, though, and it is doubtful that Kapur exaggerates the shadowy goings-on.The complicated plot line is also frustrating for someone not well-versed in Elizabethan lore - as is keeping some of the characters separate. It was my second viewing before I could fully discern between Walsingham and Norfolk. On the first viewing I thought it was the devious Norfolk who visited Mary of Guise (a.k.a. Mary, Queen of Scotts) - played most enticingly by Fanny Ardant. Instead it was Walsingham, apparently only pretending to be disloyal to Elizabeth, in order to poison Mary.Despite some confusion for the uninformed (like me), it was a most enjoyable movie. The spectacle of the English monarchy, the fear and anger of the period, the brutality and severity of both civil and religious leaders of the period, and the lushness of the English and Scottish countryside are all captured well by Kapur and cinematographer Remi Adefarasin. The film is rife with romance, passion, action and intrigue. The period dances and entertainment are also most interesting. This film has been well-honored and deservedly so. Its success is not surprising. It captures a number of  PC 21st century maxims, as Elizabeth spurns state control by religious leaders, demands her right to rule as an unmarried female, and stubbornly clings to her love - until she discovers her own reason to turn loose.The cast is marvelous from the enticing Blancett and Ardant, to Eccleston and Fiennes (probably equally enticing to female viewers), to boorish Duc d'Anjou (Vincent Cassel) who unsuccessfully tries to woo the queen. The costumes, settings and backdrops are also first-rate. This is a fine historical motion picture and a very entertaining one. I need to do some research on the period before I could call it my favorite historic drama ever. Assuming its facts stand up to scrutiny, though, Elizabeth is certainly a strong candidate for this title. It is a first rate film.",Null,0,0,9 May 2002
Sleepy Hollow," A magnificent film!
","Nearly two centuries after Washington Irvin's prose first gave American readers goosebumps, Tim Burton has succeeded in giving a new generation the willies on cool autumn nights.Burton and writers Kevin Yagher and Andrew Kevin Walker take Irvin's classic American short story and flesh it out-much like a buried Hessian reanimated from the grave. True, they mainly use Irvin's story as an inspiration, not a blueprint; yet the end product is a film that provides a rich evening of entertainment and chills for today's audiences. Surely Mr. Irvin would have wanted it that way.Instead of a gluttonous, cowardly school teacher, intent on marrying Katrina Van Tassel for her wealth, Icabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is a combination Quincy and Columbo, a late 18th century rationalist and reformer. He is a New York City constable, where his pleas for modern police and judiciary methods keep him in hot water. It is this that leads him to be sent to Sleepy Hallow, a quiet upstate hamlet where all heck has recently broken loose. If this modern scientific malarkey really works, the local brugomaster (horror great Christopher Lee) tells him, make it work in Sleepy Hallow!Intent on solving the heinous beheading of three Sleepy Hallow residents, Crane heads for the eerily foggy village and is immediately kissed (during a parlor game) by a blindfolded Katrina (Christina Ricci). He quickly gets on the locals' bad side by tartly scoffing at their claims that a headless Hessian soldier from the American Revolution has risen from the dead and is responsible for the deaths. His faith in reason and science will put sorely put to the test.SPOILERSIrvin's story, of course, used the Headless Horseman only as a tease. Anyone-even children-reading between the lines realized that bully Brom `Bones' Van Brunt dressed as the Horseman and attacked poor Icabod with a Jack-O-Lantern, scaring him away from Katrina and the Hallow forever. The 1999 tale, however, is no harmless fable of a greedy and incompetent schoolmaster. Here the Headless Horseman proves to be a real entity, raised from the dead by a local who dug up its skull and summons it by witchcraft to do his/her bidding.Burton weaves a wonderfully eerie Gothic tale of horror and suspense as Icabod sees his rationalistic beliefs shattered and overcomes a near nervous breakdown to vow to fight the demon. The cinematography and music are outstanding, as are the backdrops of the Sleepy Hallow and NYC buildings. A real 1799 feel is created by the intricate attention to detail. Even the gnarled trees and stumps in the haunted Western Woods are spooky. No wonder the original Icabod was spooked whenever he had to ride from lodging to lodging at night!Depp turns in his usual first-rate performance as the likeable but eccentric Crane. Facing painful, repressed childhood memories as he comes to grips with the supernatural realm, he shows outstanding depth. Ricci is wonderful as Katrina, lovely, steadfast and a tad mysterious. The supporting cast, including Marc Pickering as Young Masbeth and Miranda Richardson as Lady Mary Van Tassel, is marvelous. Christopher Walken, meanwhile, is quite memorable as the Hessian when he had his head. (In fact he is almost a more frightening figure than his headless corpse is!)A few delicious bits of humorous dialogue are slipped in. (Three would-be Horseman victims are warned to `Watch your heads' as they duck through a doorway to hide from the demon in a windmill. `Is he dead?' Young Masbeth asks after the windmill in which the Horseman had charged has exploded into a ball of fire. `That's the problem,' Icabod calmly replies. `He was dead to begin with!') Still, this is no horror spoof. It is a genuine chill-provider, with witchcraft, secret pacts, murder and betrayal around every bend. Other than Crane's occasionally anachronistic behavior (Entering an apparent witch's lair and announcing that he makes no judgments about her lifestyle is a bit of a stretch!), Burton and his writers succeed in capturing a 1799 feel to the movie.Overall, this is one of the most fulfilling, spinetingly horror flicks I have seen in recent years. Burton and the writers, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubeski, music composer Danny Elfman, and the rest of the cast and crew deserve a solid `A' for this effort.",Null,1,2,10 August 2003
The Alamo," Remember Hancock's Alamo!
","I now have TWO favorite versions of 'The Alamo.' While the John Wayne version will always hold a special place in my heart, I found myself completely captivated by the 2004 version.Both have their strong points. The 1960 version still has its comfortable fit--like an old pair of shoes, ragged but comfy after all these years. Both have magnificent cinematography, great musical scores and memorable characterization. I didn't think anything could challenge my images of John Wayne/Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie/Richard Widmark and Laurance Harvey/William Travis. However, I have quickly (after two viewings) come to be quite fond of the Billy Bob Thornton/Crockett, Jason Patric/Bowie and Patrick Williams/Travis characters.SPOILERS AHEAD!When I first heard of 'The Alamo' being remade, I assumed it would probably be a politically correct diatribe against all things American. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it avoided both that direction and the myth enforcing of the Wayne version. I believe director John Lee Hancock struck a happy medium.I am not enough of a historian of this time period or of the Alamo specifically to be sure just HOW historically accurate Hancock's rendition is. It is clearly closer to the surviving documentary evidence than Wayne's was, however. I like Thornton's interpretation of Crockett very much and agree that his ending was probably much closer to the truth than Wayne's. I am not sure if his actual words to Santa Ana were recorded by surviving soldiers or if they were Leslie Bohem's creation. There seems to be enough evidence, though, to suggest that the Tennessee congressman probably DID survive the actual battle, only to die at the hands of the Mexican troops. Crockett's plucky final moments are just as befitting to a legend as dying with his gun firing.Speaking of gun(s) firing, Bowie's death was also memorable. Patric's ill (apparently dying) Bowie casts a much different light on the old knife-fighter than Widmark's interpretation. Again, though, there is no dishonor in firing with both hands from one's virtual deathbed.Meanwhile, Williams' Travis is more human and much more likable than Harvey's. His rapscallion past was not brought out at all in Wayne's version. Yet his remarks to the men (minus his legendary line in the sand gesture) note that Texas was a new beginning for many of the men. His youth, more than his pomposity, is brought out in the 2004 version.I especially like Thornton's Crockett. This seems to be a much more historically accurate Crockett than Wayne-as-Crockett. In this version he is an ex-congressman, interested in getting in on the ground floor of a new nation--one he understands already has its fighting behind it. Only reluctantly is he dragged into a war. I think this is a very feasible explanation. Again, this Crockett does nothing to dishonor the legend. It merely attempts to separate man from legend. Like Daniel Boone, Crockett actually lived to see himself become a world-wide celebrity, with books and a theater production hugely exaggerating his exploits as a woodsman and fighter. Despite his desire for safety and privacy, he realized that his reputation meant something to many people--and he was willing to fight and die to protect it. Again, I think this is a very believable interpretation of Crockett. I certainly loved his gutsy answer to the Mexican army, playing their infamous 'cutthroat' battle song right back at them with his fiddle. Hancock was right in replaying this moment of the battle at the very end of the film.Speaking of the end, like 'Pearl Harbor,' the film does not end with the fall of the Alamo. It follows Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid) and Santa Ana (played with wonderful aplomb by Emilio Echevarria) through the decisive Battle of San Jacinto. Unlike 'Pear Harbor,' this technique works. Rather than water down the product like the former did, this sequence puts the Battle of the Alamo in perspective.Overall, I would call Hancock's Alamo a real winner. I just wish I had gotten to enjoy John O'Connor and Dean Semler's stunning cinematography and Carter Burwell's musical score on the big screen. O'Connor and Semler worked magic, with gorgeous sunsets, colorful uniforms and the hauntingly quiet, powerful images of the quietly advancing Mexican army during its final nighttime assault. The image of a lone bayonet advancing through the darkness will always be with me.Wayne's version will always be a classic and a comfortable fit. Hancock's Alamo, though, is a truly superb film. This Alamo is certainly worth 'remembering.'",9,4,5,6 October 2004
Duck Soup," The Brothers at their peak!
","In viewing Duck Soup for the first time in several years, I was quite taken, not only by the Marx Brothers' work, but by the strides they and Hollywood in general, had made in a few short years. I had just been reading that all newspapers, maps, etc., that characters held in their first movie, The Coconuts, had to be sopping wet, so the crackling of paper didn't drown out the dialogue in the primitive microphones. From the early `talkies' days of 1929, the studios and the four brothers had come a long way by 1933.The Marx Brothers, director Leo McCarey, and sound man Harry Lindgren showed that they had already mastered sound, in addition to the brothers' wonderful sight gags. I was completely taken in when Harpo (having been warned in a severe whisper by exotic sex kitten Raquel Torres not say a word, while spying downstairs at night, or face a firing squad), begins following the combination to what he assumes is a safe. It turns out to be a radio, loudly belting out John Phillips Sousa's `Stars and Stripes Forever,' to Harpo's horror  with the loudest and most dramatic portion coming after he has battered the radio to pieces! This is a delightful gag and Harpo manages not to telegraph it. Later, when Harpo is sent out as Paul Revere, McCarey again shows his grasp of the modern soundtrack. At first he gallops along to a dramatic cavalry charge tune (the name of which I cannot place). The tune slows, though, as Harpo's horse slows. The camera turns and we see a Thelma Todd look-alike (Who IS she, anyway? She is not mentioned in the extended cast.) undressing in the window. Suddenly `Ain't She Sweet?' replaces the galloping charge, as Harpo's attention is totally diverted (in keeping with his well-established character) from his patriotic duty.Of course this is the Marx Brothers at their peak. Groucho's witticisms and paper-thin attempts at romantic sincerity in courting wealthy Gloria Teasdale (the great Margaret Dumont) are hilarious. `Will you marry me? Did you husband leave you any money? Answer the second question first!' Later, during the battle scene, he yells `We must defend this woman's honor-which is probably more than SHE ever did!' Also during the fight, he applies water to her face after she had been knocked out by a falling light fixture. `Hey, that's our only water!' Zeppo cries, nodding toward the pitcher. To which Groucho sagely points out that `This is our only WOMAN!'  Of course his classic `I can see you leaning over a hot stove. Now I can't see the stove!' is pure Groucho. Zeppo is as solid as ever and Chico & Harpo their old boisterous selves. The `mirror' scene with Groucho and Harpo (disguised as Groucho) is one of the group's all-time highlights (which, of course, Harpo recreated with Lucille Ball years later).The sting of the Hays Code was still in the future and the boys were allowed to run roughshod  and it worked. Unlike later fare, Duck Soup showed the Marxes at their zany, irreverent (i.e., the classic scene with Harpo, a girl & a horse, in bed, with the `shoes' of each neatly laid on the floor, by the bed) best. Could they have maintained their momentum, had censorship not been tightened? Who can say? At least we have a handful of truly inspired Marx Brothers films. This one is probably the best.",Null,0,0,26 December 2002
Pearl Harbor," A Great Movie, Despite Soap Opera Elements
","Although I question whether or not this movie should indeed have been titled `Pearl Harbor,' the movie by this name was nevertheless a splendid one. I question the title merely because dozens of historical romance novels have put equal or greater emphasis on the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, without using this title.A fine evening of  entertainment on video, `Pearl Harbor' was no doubt a spectacular experience on the big screen. I regret now not having seen it at the theater. I would definitely recommend it. Little else can be said without revealing gradual plot lines. Therefore .
SPOILERS WILL FOLLOW!
Whether to try and wed war and romance has been a quandary Hollywood (and other world cinema capitols) have struggled with for decades. Only a few - usually those set in submarines, like `Run Silent, Run Deep' - manage to avoid romance all together, instead focusing on rivalries or friction between commanders and subalterns, etc.Inevitably, history and military buffs bemoan the insertion of any fictitious romantic plotline and characters into the script. Often these are plastic, irritating intermissions between the `good stuff,' such as in `In Harm's Way' and `Midway.'  At other times they tend to mislead the casual watcher and cause much confusion as to fact and fiction (i.e., `Titanic.')Although I haven't gone back to double-check for historic accuracy, I don't think this will be a problem with `Pearl Harbor.' The main fictitious plot line surrounds pilots Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) and nurse Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale). McCawley and Walker are obviously based loosely on real life Lieutenants George Welch and Ken Taylor, who drove over 100 miles an hour to reach a subordinate airfield, from which they managed to take off and make some havoc for the attackers.Of course, Hollywood being Hollywood, a bizarre soap opera love triangle develops and dominates the film when bombs are not falling. Rafe and Danny have been best friends since childhood, with the apparently slightly older Rafe always looking after Danny. This relationship is turned upside down when Rafe is presumed by all (including the military) to have been killed while volunteering in England. Danny, sharing his grief with Rafe's true love, Evelyn, eventually falls in love with her - only to see Rafe return, as if from the dead. Sound corny? Well, I guess it beats seeing McCloud slap around Police Woman in one of the other Pearl Harbor adaptations.In any case, the lovers of war movies and the historians (I count myself among both groups.) never get enough action footage or enough military strategy, amidst the kissing and betrayal. Still, about the only real negative I can say about the love theme is that it takes so long to develop. Still, by the time the Japanese finally get around to doing what the audience has waited for, most of us DO care about a few of these characters to some extent, including the boys' stuttering friend Red Winkle (Ewen Bremner) and his fiancé Betty Bayer (James King). Outside of the nurse-fly boy romance subplot is black USS Arizona cook Dorrie Miller (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), whom I believe is a real life character - or based closely on one. Miller, who had to box to earn respect in the white man's Navy, takes up an anti-aircraft gun on the stricken battleship and earns his own share of glory.This brings us to the other debate on war movies. Is war sensationalized, trivialized or glorified? I would say `Yes and no' in this case. One cannot help but be inspired by the gallant effort of  the two friends and some of their fellow pilots (based closely on real life sequences) to get planes off the ground in the most deadly of circumstances. Col. Jimmy Doolittle (Alec Baldwin) is inspiring in his candor and determination to avenge Pearl Harbor. And, while I have seem more convincing Roosevelts, Jon Voight at least captures the individual determination to strike back that FDR possessed in the black hours and weeks that followed the attack. The nurses, too, find their `finest hour,' after weeks of giving shots and meeting soldiers and sailors on the beach. Amidst flying glass, screams of the dying and gushing blood, Evelyn and her crew show that men weren't the only heroes of the day.Yet I don't think war was glorified or sanitized here. In fact, the special affects, attention to historical detail and some new, brave looks at death and disaster may have given `Pearl Harbor' a leg up on many war films. As torpedoes and bomb hit, ships blow up and sink. Men burn; men bleed; men drown. Zeroes strafe the water for survivors; Zeroes strafe the hospital; Zeroes strafe the pilots racing to their waiting planes. I'm sure on the wide screen a fireman would be out of his seat more than once, as flaming plane fuselages and other debris fly right past the camera.
Director Michael Bay does not shy away from the hellish aspect of war. The U.S. Navy was caught flat-footed and, even in times of preparation, men die gruesome deaths in battle. With `an entire navy at anchor,' in FDR's stunned words, the results are worse. We see men drown; we see men trapped inside sunken ships who will not get out; we see hideously burned patients in delirium as gallant clergymen try to give a last bit of comfort. Bay should be commended for balancing all of the components of the film and coming up with a cohesive and satisfying whole. My only complaint with the video is that the subtitles for the Japanese dialogue are MUCH too small to read on the small screen. (I had to put on my reading glasses and sit in front of the TV like I would my computer, to read them.) Still, that beats having Borris Badenov's voice come out of Admiral Yamamoto's mouth, as it did in `Midway!'True, the Battle of Pearl Harbor and the subsequent Doolittle Raid were dramatic enough that they needed no fictitious love triangle to sell the story. With Hollywood, though, one takes what one can get. What you GET from this film are some spectacular and very accurate battle scenes from angles never before attempted, some earthy, brave portrayals of the agony and hellishness of war, and strong performances by the main characters. I would call `Pearl Harbor' a real winner.",Null,0,1,23 January 2002
Seabiscuit," Seabiscuit is a real treat
","One thing is certain: Martin Scorsese could never have directed Seabiscuit! Scorsese would have been absolutely lost, trying to direct a biopic about decent, genuinely likable characters. That is certainly part of Seabiscuit's magic. Another ingredient is the classic American sports movie motif of never giving up, rolling with the punches and regaining self-respect. When that motif is extended and given the much broader and more poignant association with the nation as a whole, grappling with the Great Depression, one really has a story that grabs and holds the audience.Seabiscuit is a joy to watch for several reasons. In addition to those already alluded to, the film is also exquisitely shot and edited and extremely well-acted. It is also very historically accurate.While director Gary Ross and his cohort on the DVD commentary stress that the protagonists are all flawed, contrary to today's popular Hollywood assembly line style, they are still very decent, likable people. I find it very difficult to avoid using the term 'likeable' over and over in recounting the film and its characters.Start with Charles Howard. Jeff Bridges' portrayal of the self-made auto magnate, turned horse owner is brilliant. He captures all the nuances as Howard fights his way up in true Horatio Alger style, then finds his success empty after his son is killed and his marriage disintegrates. Ross, in his commentary, talks considerably about Howard healing himself as he reaches out to help others in the story.Helping HIM heal is Marcella (Elizabeth Banks), a young beauty, but also an extremely kind, determined woman. I absolutely fell in love with Banks as Mrs. Howard  and considering how highly I regard Howard, I felt good seeing him marry her.Tobey Maguire is brilliant as jockey Johnnie 'Red' Pollard, a down-on-his-luck jockey who has to scrap as a boxer to get by and Chris Cooper is wonderful as iconoclastic trainer Tom Smith. Real-life jockey Gary Stephens, meanwhile, adds realism and a surprisingly natural stage presence as legendary jockey George Woolf.Flawed antagonists? Certainly. Howard finds that his faith in technology and corporate America have left him alone and shaken. Maguire, hurting over the breakup of his family as a youth and his hard knock life, is too proud to accept help at first and has a hair-trigger temper. Smith is a man whose day has passed and one who doesn't connect with others like Howard does. Of course Seabiscuit himself fits this mold.Yet their flaws only make them more real. Together, as Ross notes on the commentary, these unlikely partners help heal each other and the broken down racehorse. Scorsese would be lost with these characters.The film tells the consummate American success story. Just glancing at titles of message board entries, I see that many are quick to pick up on this and dis the film for it. I suppose for those who dislike America, capitalism and/or underdog stories, the film WOULD be a bit disagreeable. Howard, apparently true to his real-life persona, is a kind, caring, fatherly figure of a capitalist. True, not all US business moguls were gold-hearted Daddy Warbucks', but Howard typified the best of this breed. He really believed in the American success story after arriving in San Francisco with twenty-one cents to his name.Promoting Seabiscuit was more an act of spreading his personal gospel of determination and self-worth to a beleaguered country than it was a money-making or ego-enhancing venture.While many readersboth American and foreignmay not want to hear this, this was a story that COULD only have happened in America. And, as we know, it really DID happen there.",9,2,4,15 February 2005
Lawrence of Arabia," Fine film, but I didn't connect
","This is one film I wish I could have seen on the big screen. I get the distinct impression that watching it (with lights on, due to concern about recent eye strain as a grad student) on my 19-inch 1985 TV & $60 VCR simply did not do justice to the film. Even in this format I could tell that it was a visual masterpiece.Peter O'Toole, Omar Sherif, Anthony Quinn and Alec Guiness are superb. It is definitely a classic. Yet I have to confess that I wasn't swept off my feet the way I had anticipated. Best movie ever? And I don't mean one screwball in 100 making this claim, but film lover after film lover seem to feel this way-most of them obviously intelligent film connoisseurs. (It was even immortalized by Billy Joelin fact, every time I looked at the video box, I'd catch myself singing `Lawrence of Arabia, British Beatle mania') I probably need to watch it again when I'm in a different mood. Or perhaps after doing a little research on the real Lawrence.As it was, I came away with quite an ambiguous feeling about the man (as I suppose we were intended to) and somewhat puzzled by some of his mood swings and reactions. O'Toole's version of Lawrence definitely IS that of a charismatically gifted man, bordering on madness. I actually found the Arabs, Prince Feisel (Guiness), Ali (Sherif) and Auda (Quinn) much more likeable and on the level.A few things puzzle me, such as: Was Lawrence TRYING to be captured (walking through a mud puddle, etc.) just prior to being tortured by the Turks? If so, why? Also, why was he singled out of the group of Arabs to be punished/tortured? Or, is this where some of the gay references have come in?Actually I can't find much about the film to criticize; it was obviously very well done. It just doesn't connect with me in a way that many of my favorite films have. I enjoyed Patton, Waterloo and Conspiracy much more. It's probably just me, though. Enough knowledgeable viewers are knocked off their feet by L of A. Maybe on a second viewing I will be, too.",Null,0,2,5 January 2003
Garden State," Braff looks like the real thing
","After watching Garden State, I feel privileged to be one of the earlier riders on the Zach Braff bandwagon. Make that the Zach Braff sidecar.This little gem thoroughly impressed meespecially for a directorial debut. That Braff was also the star of the film makes his work even more commendable. I definitely look forward to seeing future projects by Braff.Crew members compared Garden State's feel to a Hal Ashby film. I would agree (from what limited knowledge I have of Ashby's work) and add that he seems to have a little Lasse Hallstrom, Wes Anderson and Jean-Pierre Jeunet in him as well. Of course we're getting a bit ahead of ourselves. Obviously, Braff will have to prove himself on more than one film and will have to make the transition from indy shoestring-budget promise to major production brilliance like the aforementioned trio did before he can be mentioned in the same breath with such masters.Braff is certainly off to a flying start, though. The semi-autobiographical film has a gentle, lilting feel to itsort of like Natalie Portman's contagious, lopsided smile. Somewhat dark, and yet upbeat, the film is pleasant to look at and listen to and leaves the viewer strangely fulfilled. From the acting to the unique sets to the New Jersey countryside to the interesting wide-angle shots, the film has Braff's signature clearly inscribed on it. It is more than enough to make a film fan salivate over the work Braff may produce in the future.For now, his canon consists of one filman extremely well-make film. Braff teams with Portman to form a memorable couple. Portman is cuddly, spunky and full of vitalityin stark contrast to Braff's numb character during the movie's early stages. Peter Sarsgaard turns in good work as Braff's grave-digging high school buddy. The rest of the cast is very solid and gives the film an almost surrealistic feel to it. Almost in a daze until near the end, Andrew Largemen (Braff) sits stoically through some totally bizarre scenes until Portman's quirky warmth gradually penetrates his hardened outer shell.I would say that if one likes Anderson's work (i.e., Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums), Jeunet's (Amelie) or Hallstrom's (Gilbert Grape, Chocolat, etc.), one quite likely would be charmed and warmed by Garden State. Whatever Braff's future holds, he has already done what many directors never do: produce an original and memorable film.",9,1,2,3 January 2005
Paranormal Activity," Can't quite capture 'Blair' magic
","Ten years ago a couple of guys with a camera and a handful of unknown actors turned the cinematic world on its collective ear. They produced a bizarre gem of a thriller for less than $25,000. Ignoring the somewhat questionable marketing of The Blair Witch Project, the cast and crew showed that a hand-held camera could serve as narrator and that CGI, monster costumes, blood, gore, etc., were not absolutely necessary to provoke fright.That technique in and of itself, however, is no guarantee of producing a legitimately scary film. Owen Peli has followed the same formula in the much-anticipated Paranormal Activity. It is a cross between The Haunting and The Blair Witch Project, we were told for months. Well  the plot, perhaps, is a combination of those two, plus Poltergeist and The Amityville Horror. The quality doesn't quite match most of those others.Overall, I think Paranormal Activity is OK. Rookies Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat turn in stellar work. However, I don't think PA captures the raw emotion and terror of Blair Witch. Chained to the camera-as-narrator device, meanwhile, it fails to evoke Haunting or Poltergeist-like chills, either.I almost wonder if a film ABOUT the couple trying to capture the occurrences on camera might not have worked better, such as in Poltergeist. In the Blair Witch type films, there is always an awkward moment where there is danger, yet someone takes time to grab the camera, ignoring the others' remonstrations to put the camera down. Of course, if they didn't grab it, there wouldn't be a film. Therefore the quest of 'realism' actually brings about a LOSS of realism. (Would it have cost much more money to have one stable camera recording the events as the couple makes their own video?) The film has its moments. It does gradually build up tension as events escalate and both endings are creepy. Still, there just isn't enough going on throughout the film to really keep an audience on the edge of its seat. Maybe if it were filmed in a more eerie, Gothic setting, where the house had some history, as well as the girl, it might hold tension better.The format works, as we have seen, but has its built-in flaws. Blair Witch never seemed to suffer for those flaws. That cannot truthfully be said of Paranormal Activity. Somehow PA misses matching Blair Witch's intensity and frightfulness by half a step.",7,0,0,9 January 2010
Jaws," It's not just 'the best shark film!'
","Seeing people call Jaws `the best shark film ever made' is like calling Princess Di `the best-looking parent of Prince William!' It's factual, but it's certainly darning it with faint praise! (And, other than its sub-par sequels, WERE there any other `shark' movies???)That aside, Jaws is one of those films that started out fairly high in my estimation and continues to climb as years go by. I was actually a tad disappointed when I finally got to see it at the theatre as a 12-year-old. This was simply because it had been the most-hyped movie of all time, up till then. I don't know WHAT I was expecting, but certainly more than a motion picture could ever provide!Later, I admitted that it was a quite good film. After college cinema class, I had to admit that it was especially well-made. As an adult, I came to consider it one of my favorite films. Finally, today, I can look back and call it one of Hollywood's finer moments. I would rate Jaws among the best 3-4 films made since 1970, and, as a recent reviewer called it, `the grand-daddy' of the action/adventure genre. (It was also the first true summer blockbuster!)So much more than a tale of a man-eating shark, Jaws captures the small-town, tourist economy that thrives on visitors. The fictitious Amity is perfectly depicted and Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) is the perfect representative of this mindset. Not a bad guy, just a harried local official, mindful that the community's lifeblood depends on the brief beach season, he is out of his element when that same blood begins gushing up on the pristine white beaches. I won't go into deep details; others have already covered the key points. The then-unknown cast sparkles, the script is magnificent-especially the tremendous USS Indianapolis scene, which adds SO MUCH to the depth of the characters and also reinforces the peril that they are about to face, and the cinematography is outstanding. The live shark footage from Australia, combined with a few limited close-ups of `Bruce,' is a deft touch. Of course, John Williams' music helps make it what it is, too.Little human touches, like the youngest Brody boy imitating his father's every movement at the kitchen table, make the film much more than an everyday horror/adventure flick. Another favorite moment that always makes me chuckle out loud is when Michael (Chris Rebello) is in his new rowboat. Brody (Roy Schneider) harshly orders him out of the boat. Mrs. Brody (Lorraine Gary) scolds Brody for his actions (actually making him change his mind), only to see the painting in the book he was holding, of a shark ramming its snout through a wooden rowboat & scream `Did you HEAR your father? Get OUT of that boat!' :o)There's even a built-in trivia question: `What's ironic about the title?' Answer: `It's about a shark and sharks HAVE no jaws!' Food for thoughterexcuse mepoor choice of words, there, under the circumstances! ;o)This is a must-see, if anyone has somehow missed it.",Null,0,1,11 January 2003
Amélie," I'm keeping an eye out for an Amelie in MY neighborhood!
","Being no scholar of French cinema, I cannot place Jean-Pierre Juenet's Amelie in the proper scale or historic contest among French films. Being a film lover, though, I know it places very highly on my own personal list.Juenet, whose style reminds me of two of my other favorite contemporary directors, Lasse Hallstrom and Wes Anderson, combines wonderful visual imagery and colors, interesting camera angles and editing and a fun pace throughout the film, to bring home a big container of fun. No one can call Amelie a 'dark' film-although, I suppose, that argument could be made in one sense. Overall, the Juenet's work is bright and glowing with innocent optimism, tempered with just a dash of well-meaning cynicism.
I won't go into the plot here and hope to avoid spoilers, but the story is an uplifting one of a young waitress, devoid of emotional support as a child, who stumbles upon a special gift of sharing as a young woman. Like many of Hallstrom and Anderson's characters, Amelie starts out emotionally stunted, due to a lack of warmth from her father and neurotic behavior by her mother. Unlike many of the Norwegian and American's characters, however, Amelie gradually breaks out of her shell, helping others, and finally confronts her own personal emotional glass ceiling.Audrey Tatou is adorable as Amelie, sexy, shy, clever, cowardly, daring and-above all-real. You probably have an Amelie living on YOUR block. (I know I'm keeping MY owns open on MINE!) The rest of the cast is outstanding, too, including Serge Merlin as the elderly `glass-boned' painter and apartment building sage.I had heard the film mentioned often, but had never seen a trailer or read much about it. I have to admit that, just looking at the front and back of the video box (with Tatou's China doll-white face on the front and the Santa Claus figure on the back, I wasn't sure if it was a live-actor film or a claymation project. I know now! lolPlayful, a tad precocious, yet poignant, Amelie might be the best 2001 movie. This is quite a compliment coming from a huge fan of Hallstrom's The Shipping News and Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums. It deserves its praise.",9,0,2,18 October 2002
