Hereditary," Don't watch it alone in the night!
","Those who are scared easily are adviced not to watch it, those who are not don't watch it alone in the night. This movie is perfect blend of old school and new type of horror. You never get the chance to get off the hook. Solid cinematography and storyline. Only minus of this film was slow moving plot in first half, but it definitely finished off in style.",9,1,5,19 May 2019
