The Blair Witch Project," Being original is not enough
","I concede it's an original, but can't overlook the irritating flaws.  By forcing the to actors to 'be real,' they ad lib.  That encourages Heather's shrill line deliveries, and a middle that lags as the crew breaks down into days (and nights) of bickering.  As for who's doing what to whom: Face it, it's a deliberate muddle.  That's why it's scaring so many people.  They're letting their minds convince them something awful is going on when no one can be sure of anything.  Yet, ironically, this cinematic chicanery is the film's strength.  Hitchcock would have been proud.  But he would have made Heather more sympathetic.",7,0,2,23 August 1999
Mulan," Dramatic core undermined by comic sidekicks
","Like 'Pocahontas' before it, 'Mulan' is a sumptuously animated adventure made wobbly by its heavy-handed message against sex role stereotyping.  Yes, we learn, women can stretch beyond their social roles, even fight in combat. Yet, the men are depicted either as noble egotists or dolts.  Worse, Eddie Murphy's comic sidekick dragon is an annoyance, no doubt written because every Disney animated feature must now have a recognizable cut-up to aid their heroines.  Still, the Disney storytelling strength is there.",7,0,1,6 January 1999
The Thing," Underrated, paranoid gut-cruncher
","John Carpenter drops us into the center of a claustrophobic, icy military camp, then unchains a horrific extraterrestrial beast.  Long on gore, the film nonetheless manages to raises the goose-flesh in a more subtle manner: We never know who the monster is.  I know... it's an old musty device.  But it works.",7,0,1,6 January 1999
The Village," Victim of past success
","The problem here is M. Night Shyamalan is a victim of his own success. After the genre-transforming 'Sixth Sense,' with its now famous twist ending, audiences expect Shyamalan to jolt us no matter how intrusive it is to the story.  And he's happily obliged by reworking the formula with 'Unbreakable' (What makes Bruce Willis indestructible?) and 'Signs' (Are the aliens real?).  'The Village' is ultimately one long waiting game.  While it envelopes us in its impeccable recreation of an agrarian society, the plot is hellbent on shattering our preconceptions.  And knowing that, we watch it waiting for the revelations, not engrossed in the tale, despite a star-making performance by Bryce Dallas Howard.When the director finally reveals his hand, the 'twists' are predictable and maddeningly unimaginative.  I expect audiences, who wanted to conceal the end of 'The Sixth Sense' to insure their friends' enjoyment, will be anxious to reveal all to save their friends' $10 for a ticket.It's not that Shyamalan doesn't have a point here. He's clearly making a statement about post-9/11 America.  But the moral is overshadowed by his obligation to shock us.",Null,0,0,31 July 2004
Seabiscuit," Stumbles out of the gate
","Gary Ross's exquisite direction is done in by his ham-fisted screenplay.  We only know Seabiscuit inspired Depression-era America because he tells us over and over and over, like an amateur historian wielding a mallet. 
He wants to create a roaring crowd-pleaser and a reverential slice of America.  He succeeds somewhat at the first, but fails miserably at the second.  Part of the problem is that Ross crams too much of the story into a clipped, cross-cut first act that gives his actors too little room to blossom as real people.  Ross's ripe dialog doesn't help.The film finally kicks into gear when the wonder horse arrives.  But even during the 'emotional' final act, Ross smothers us in teeth-grinding symbolism.But there's no doubt the races are well-shot.",Null,0,1,5 August 2004
The Shawshank Redemption," Well-polished cliches
","The evangelical adoration this film has earned is lost on me.  Like so many popular films of recent years, 'Shawshank' is an obvious, cliche-riddled epic that's won fans because it plays it safe.  Characters are either saintly or satanic.  There's no room for shades of gray.  Sure its sumptuously filmed.  A $50 million budget can do that.  Add the always solid Morgan Freeman, a paper-thin moral about hope, and you've got a film longing to be loved.  Obviously, plenty of people do.But compared to Freeman, Tim Robbins' vanilla performance as the long-suffering innocent (dare I say Christ-like) man trapped in purgatory comes off bland.  Clancy Brown as the sadistic prison guard is the worst cliche of the all.  When you toss in the obligatory prison rapes, the corrupt warden, and James Whitmore (who is very good) as the veteran inmate unprepared for life outside the institution, you've got a predictable film that only snaps to life near its plot-holed conclusion.   
Worse of all, Frank Darabont directs the works at half-speed. This is a painfully overlong concoction.In time, 'The Shawshank Redemption' will be regarded as a well-crafted but shallow prison film.",6,2,5,22 July 2000
Saboteur," Underrated gem from Hitch
","Like 'Lifeboat' and 'Foreign Correspondent,' this contribution to the war effort may preach too much and wave the flag in spots, but its heart is pure Hitch.  Reworking his irresistible 'wrong man' theme, Hitch's use of all-American Bob Cummings is ideal.  Too many viewers confuse Cummings' white bread persona as a failing of the film.  In fact, Hitch uses his lead's lightness to show how even a 'guy-next-door' like Cummings could be tagged as an evildoer.  Hitch then uses Cummings' charm to tap our sympathy. As for Hitch's stylish set-pieces (the Statue of Liberty climax, the shoot-out at Radio City, and the wonderful stop aboard the circus train), all I can say is: superb.",Null,1,5,2 September 2001
