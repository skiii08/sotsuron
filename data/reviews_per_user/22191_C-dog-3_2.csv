Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's a hit!!!
","This movie has remarkable special effects and plenty of unbelievable characters (e.g. Darth Maul and Jar Jar Binks) but I don't think the plot was quite as good as I had originally expected.  I was able to go to a premier in New York city on Friday with my Dad (I saw Natalie Portman and Howard Stern).  The atmosphere and excitement for this movie has never been matched which is why I didn't even find it disappointing.  The fight sequences were amazing especially the showdown between Darth Maul vs. Obi-Wan and Qui-gon Jinn.  I believe that the movie's classic themes, that is good vs. evil and the power of the Force were definitely present here but they just were not as effective elements this time around.  My only other complaint was that some of the special effects seemed to be a little distracting but the amount of complexity in developing some of the shots is unreal.  The fact that Lucas could generate a cast of thousands by using special effects is simply amazing.  I hope the next movie is darker, much like the Empire Strikes Back (one of my favorite movies).",9,1,3,11 May 1999
Edward Scissorhands," Beauty and the Beast.
","Tim Burton has updated an old tale of the misunderstood and scary-looking beast (Edward) and his love relationship with an incomparable beauty (Kim or Winona Ryder).  The tale is modernized (sort of) into a suburbia America setting with 60's styles houses, clothing, cars, and people.  The reason this movie is so likable is simply because it interweave's romanticism and darkness with bits of comedy to relieve the tension of the viewer.  This dark fable puts chills down your spine (e.g. when Edward first steps out of the darkness of the attic to meet Peg) while at the same time fills your heart with an equal mixture of happiness and sorrow.  In addition, Burton's  picture was filmed with great elegance.  Who can forget the scene when Edward is carving the ice sculptor and Kim is dancing in the snow he has created?  The ending of the movie is not as melancholy as everyone believes.  It is revelatory about who the real monster is.  This movie can obviously be compared with other tales of individuals who were also outcasts in their society such as Frankenstein and Burton's other masterpiece, Batman.  This work of Burton's is his personal statement to all pariahs who have ever been spurned by the greater populus.",10,0,0,8 February 1999
