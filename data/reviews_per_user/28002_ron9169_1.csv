The Avengers," Deserving of the Block-Buster Hit Status
","Third highest grossing movie of all-time is none other than the avengers. Now The Avengers is the ultimate popcorn, get all your buddies, Friday night kind of movie. Each character had a distinctive personality and I liked seeing them clash with one another. You're not going to see this as, 'Oh I'm Captain America. Oh I'm the Incredible Hulk. I'm Thor. Hey we just met each other let's go fight evil together.' No, their personalities clash and you really see the characters building relations, arguing, and overall interactions amongst each other.The Avengers is a great adaption of marvel's famous comic books. Starring Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man, Chris Evans as Steve Rodgers/Captain America, Mark Garofolo as Bruce Banner/The Hulk, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Scarlet Johansson as Natasha Romanov/Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as agent Clint Barton/Hawkeye, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick fury, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Colston, Stellan Skarsgard as Dr. Erick Selvic, and I think I've hit all of the high notes, those are the most important people in the movie, at any rate. Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man), you knew exactly what to expect from him and his character due to his starring roles in the two previous Iron Man movies, he still delivers. Captain America/Tony Stark/Chris Evans, again you can kind of know what to expect from his previous film, but there are some changes to his character, because he is now a man 70 years out of his time, this dude is suffering from the worst case of culture shock ever, and he manages to get that across. I was actually fairly impressed with that. He is moodier than he was from the first captain America movie, which is to be expected because everything he knows is just gone. Chris Hemsworth as Thor, again you kind of know what to expect as there has been a Thor movie. He did manage to portray the changes in Thor's character because honestly this guy has suffered some pretty hard blows in the last couple years, and he's more thoughtful more introspective, not nearly as arrogant, just as reckless; still just goes charging in with the hammer. With that said, they didn't do a complete rewrite of Thor, which is good. All in all he did a good job, as expected, which is great. It's what you want anyways. Same goes to say for all the other characters, they deliver.I actually didn't care for the opening sequence too much. Loki showing up, and having the scene devolve to a car chase, felt odd to me. Throughout the film everyone is a smart ass at the expense of genuine dialogue. It's funny the first couple of times but really grates on repeat viewings. Another thing is, if you haven't sat down and watched the previous marvel movies such as: Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captain America, you will not enjoy the movie anywhere near as much as the contrary. That is not to the detriment of The Avengers though, really it's what allows the avengers to be as good as it is, as it can get right into the action. All of the character development, the other stuff that has taken place, origin stories, explanations of characters, who's doing what to whom, back story, and all of that stuff, has already been taken of prior to The Avengers, so you can come into this as a viewer and see these heroes doing what they do best frequently throughout the duration of the film.Great actor portrayals and staying true to the franchise is what makes this film such a hit. The Avengers is that kind of big Hollywood blockbuster that you don't get to often. The Avengers gets a high score in my book, and it is probably one of the best movies marvel has ever made.",8,0,3,15 November 2012
