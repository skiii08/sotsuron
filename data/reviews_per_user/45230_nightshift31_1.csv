The Avengers," simply put Joss is amazing
","I've been part of the Joss verse since (Buffy 1997) - (Dollhouse 2010)so i had no worries this was going to be good but, i gotta say the he still surprised me.the avengers is probably the biggest movie of the year considering the scalemy quick review 'amazing' all characters were well written the team was well balanced no one member really stood out. the part i think we were all concerned with was hulk he's been F****ed pretty bad in the past (i liked Norton's hulk) and in my opinion hulk was amazing he wasn't over sized and just looked great.Avengers is a action packed edge of your seat hart thumping masterpiece this is a must see in theaters.i feel this was Joss Whedons way of showing the people out side of the Joss verse why we love him so. Well done Joss thank you",10,14,28,27 April 2012
