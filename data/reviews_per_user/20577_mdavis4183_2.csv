Iron Man 3," It Sucks
","I was expecting to see Iron Man battle the Madarin and his rings of power. Instead I got a left wing hate corporations hit piece that reduced the Manarin to the rank of fool. This is a special effects movie that ignores and degrades the powers of one of the best super villains.Moreover, they're calling this 'the best Iron Man ever'? Evidently, it's the last Iron Man ever from the way it ends. I was extremely disappointed in this movie. I hope they do better with the rest of the Marvel comics movies in the works.When it comes to honoring the Iron Man of the decades of comics, this travesty isn't even close.",1,18,38,3 May 2013
X-Men: The Last Stand," Killing Off X-men is BAD idea
","FOX tries to kill any chance of another X-men series by killing off Pofessor X and Cyclops and removing Magneto's powers. I'm surprised Stan Lee agreed to this. Jean Grey does become the Phoenix. That is good. But I don't buy the army of mutants raised by Magneto or that Mystique could be so easily defeated. The real Magneto would not expose himself to the 'cure' without a backup plan. Like a 'cure' for the 'cure'.The X-men franchise is a license to print money. FOX must hate their investors to kill the franchise in three movies. Yeah, Halley Berry wanted out, but she's not the most important X-man.Shame on FOX. Shame on Marvel for allowing FOX to create this travesty.",7,1,2,30 May 2006
