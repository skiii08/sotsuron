Blade Runner 2049," Filed under: spectacular movies that lost money but I'm glad they exist
","I had the opportunity to see it in IMAX and I'm so glad I did! That being said, I'm still trying to digest the story. Blade Runner 2049 felt like it progressed with the intricate story laid down by its predecessor. It's going to take a few re-watches to really get my opinion of it set in stone.I'm not going to spoil anything by indulging in the story details; I'm still trying to digest it myself. What I can tell you is despite its complexities, it's actually well-paced and leaves plenty of room for debate and question. It's a unique franchise, absolutely. I mean, how else does one make an effective neo-noir sci-fi movie while being a visual effects game-changer? It's not an easy task, but Dennis Villanueve handles well. I don't feel like it fleshes out the original as much as I had hoped, but it definitely runs with what it has.With regards to its technical mastery of sound and visual effects, oh man. Seldom will you find something that approaches it. It's easily worth the $16 and change to see it in IMAX. For those who are so inclined, I strongly implore you to make the effort to see it in this format. Roger Deakins absolutely nails it. Will definitely be seeing it again in theaters, if only to soak in the visuals and the overwhelming score by Hans Zimmer.Re-review: running length is a delicate task. Too short and you lose valuable plot points, too long and you bore your audience. It's seemingly too long for a movie but too short to expand into a series. For me, it's a detractor, but ultimately not enough to make me dread watching it ever again. Still great.",9,0,11,23 December 2019
First Man," See on the biggest screen you can or don't see it at all
","Full credit to Damien Chazelle for not shying away from realness. The space sequences are mesmerizing, enthralling, overwhelming, sometimes nauseating, and heart-pounding. The human drama is this director's specialty. He masterfully depicts pain without it feeling like torture. He tells it as it is. Yeah, Armstrong isn't exactly a dynamo of a character, but when your task is to land on the freakin' moon without crashing, I encourage you to show me how you'd do it with more authenticity.",8,0,0,23 December 2019
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," You won't see another one like it
",CLASSIC. My first viewing in so many years. Ought to be taught in animation courses and film courses in general.,10,2,2,23 December 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," An absolute gift of a film
","Not that I like lists; they always change. But if you compiled the top 100 animated films, this would easily crack the top 25 for me. An ageless animation style, character depth deeper than the Mariana Trench, and seemingly infinite Easter eggs make you want to watch it again as soon as it's over.",10,0,2,23 December 2019
The Grand Budapest Hotel," What do you know? Ralph Fiennes made me cry
","Gustave H. talks about humanity, though he knows he's not the most sterling example of the species. There's a part at the end where we know he was right all along. Yeah, you can say the movie is largely about a bunch of dysfunctional, quirky morons who all have something to do with a pastel pink-painted, sometimes dilapidated hotel, but you can't deny there's something truly authentic about it all.",10,0,0,23 December 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," The 'Most Tarantino' Tarantino Movie
",The only bad thing about this movie is that we only have one Quentin Tarantino movie left.,10,11,16,23 December 2019
The Dark Knight Rises," I'm content with seeing it once
","Most impactful on a huge screen, and for the memes it inspired. It suffers from studio heads wanting a movie, and the writer/director suddenly having a useless script because their most compelling actor died. So they down a gallon of coffee and churn out something that somehow works, but in less-capable hands would be a travesty. See it once, do the impression of Bane that makes you sound like Sean Connery speaking into a Solo cup, and then leave it alone. It will get worse with every re-watch.",7,0,0,23 December 2019
Incredibles 2," A bit late for a sequel but zero real complaints here
","Not bad for a movie that spent over a decade in development hell. I liked it. I'm glad I saw it. Did it really innovate on the original work? If it did, I didn't notice. But it added depth, and Bob Odenkirk's character was my favorite part, oddly enough. Mr. 'Don't drink and drive, but if you do, call me' found his way into a children's-movie-for-adults movie. Pretty good.",8,2,2,23 December 2019
