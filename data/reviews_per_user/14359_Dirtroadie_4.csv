Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The better half of the two Bill movies
","After almost writing Tarantino off after the first Bill movie, the second one was a pleasant surprise. There is more movie and less manic Kung Fu nonsense. David Carradine is great as the sly Bill and there are lots of great character bits. There were fewer long fight scenes, and there was actually a wealth of that depraved dialog that makes Tarantino films great. The epilogue scene was weak and useless, but what the heck, lots of good films have less than stellar moments. I still wish I could have watched a more compact 2.5 hour Bill movie, but wish in one hand...and, well, you know the rest. I see the second Bill movie ranks lower than the first in the top 250. Popularity is not the same as quality, kids. Learn that, Grasshoppa, and you will stand one step higher on the great mountain of truth.",8,0,1,8 January 2005
The Irishman," Add it to the pantheon of great crime dramas
","On the Waterfront. The Godfather. Once Upon a Time in America. Heat. The Departed. Some of the best movies ever made are set in the seedy criminal underworld. It's a great vehicle for drama and Martin Scorsese is the undisputed master of the genre. Having said all that, I was a little skeptical of The Irishman before I watched it. Its run time of 3 1/2 hours is intimidating and there was a lot of publicity about the de-aging CGI used for De Niro, Pesci, and Pacino, all of whom were more than 74 years old at the time of filming.The run time turned out not to be an issue for me and that is saying a lot. I have to exercise discipline to sit through most 90 minute movies now that I have become so jaded from endless repetition of tropes like jump scares, time travel, toothy monsters, choreographed fights and gratuitous sex scenes. The Irishman is long, but it doesn't wear on your patience, and we should be glad such movies are still being made.The results of the de-aging CGI were mixed. On the positive side, it looked realistic enough and there were no uncanny valley moments. The downside is that it only goes so far. De Niro, Pesci and Pacino always looked considerably older than the ages of the men they were portraying, and the look didn't change much over the course of the main part of the story arc, which spanned 15 - 20 years.One could also quibble about casting choices. The very Italian Pacino looks nothing like the German/Irish Hoffa who was actually born in rural Indiana. It is also hard to see how young Peggy (Lucy Gallina) became older Peggy (Anna Paquin) and the mid-30's Anna Paquin looked too old to be playing the early 1970's Peggy, who would have only been in her 20's. It would be a fair criticism to say that the casting was all over the place and was at its roots a love letter from Scorsese to his old friends and not dictated by what the real-life characters would suggest. Nevertheless, the old pros gave their usual great performances and you will just have to suspend your disbelief a little bit more than usual when it comes to casting.There isn't a lot for women to do in The Irishman, and while it is true that career criminal is mostly a male gig, it is easy to see how women might be annoyed at the overwhelmingly male presence in the movie. One can't help but think that more could have been done, and that is coming from a guy who won't be bingeing the Watchmen series anytime soon.Now that the criticisms are done, it is worth repeating that The Irishman is just a great movie. The performances are great. The writing and directing are great. The criminal underworld setting is a field day for high drama and themes of family, loyalty and morality. The 3 1/2 hour run time makes it a slow burn for sure, but that just means there is more to love. Yet it isn't simply another mafia movie. All of the characters and events that I bothered to research seemed to be accurately portrayed in the movie. I don't know how much artistic license was taken, but I didn't find any obvious discrepancies. And while the words of a psychopath like Frank Sheeran certainly need to be taken with a boulder of rock salt, his confessions haven't been disproved from what I read on the subject.In summary, if you like the genera, then The Irishman really is a must-see. It really is that good.",9,2,5,10 January 2020
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," I liked it, but I don't know why
","The main thing I heard about this movie before I saw it was that it was the most violent movie ever made. Not surprising for a Tarantino movie, but once I saw it the violence turned out to be rather cartoonish, which was, I suppose, the point. Evidently the movie was inspired by, pays homage to, or spoofs Japanese anime cartoons. I really don't care about the connection other than to say that I intensely dislike anime, martial arts movies, and the people who go ape over either. Its all very childish and quite emblematic of the Ritalin generation. Nevertheless, it is a Tarantino film, and it does have oodles of that sophisticated yet disgusting humor that make us Tarantino watchers keep coming back for more. Tarantino could have cut out two hours of tiresome Kung Fu fight scenes and just made one movie, but which would make everyone more money? Hmm? Well, we know the answer. Currently this movie is at #58 in the top 250--a distinction it doesn't deserve, but it does deserve it more than some others on the list.",8,0,2,8 January 2005
Edge of Tomorrow," A pastiche of familiar Hollywood tropes
","Like the repeating time travel story device this movie uses, we have seen this before in Star Trek episodes, Groundhog Day, etc, etc. Sure, Tom Cruise gives us another charismatic performance, and there is a flavor-of-the-month hot blonde half his age to fuel our naughtier fantasies. There are explosions and special effects and technologically advanced yet mindless space aliens.But does any of that make it a good movie? Not to my admittedly limited capacity brain. I suppose I could go into listing plot holes and asking other rhetorical questions about how and why what happened, but things like that don't really interest me that much. What does interest me is dramatic impact and thought provoking situations and dialog. Sadly, there is little of that present in Edge of Tomorrow.",6,1,4,22 March 2015
