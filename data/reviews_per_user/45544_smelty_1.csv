Scarface," violent gang/mob flick
","The potential for greatness existed,but it fell short.It's hard to believe that the heavy hitting talent of Al Pacino was,ironically,the films biggest shortcoming.Pacino's attempt at an accent was absolutely pathetic and ruined my ability to completely enjoy the film.If this major detail can be overlooked,the film offers quality to violent gang/mob films enthusiasts.6/10",6,0,2,27 October 2003
