Skyfall," A confused film full of complete morons
","For me the problem with this film is that it's trying to be two very different things. Bond as gritty realism is good. Bond as camp nonsense is good. This is trying to be both and I don't think it can do that successfully. As a person I am very rational, so I may well find it harder than most to suspend disbelief. I can do it in most circumstances but EVERYONE in this film is a complete moron. James Bond is a moron. M is a moron. The politicians are morons. The police and security are sedated, cross-eyed morons. The baddies are all morons. Every single person working at MI5 is a moron.Yes, obviously you can and will have that implausibly unrealistic situation where trained assassins can't shoot each other with 50 bullets from 10 foot but in my opinion you have to at least TRY and have a reason they can't hit each other. That, I think, is why you have to have Bond on location on his own, so it's one on one or Bond is outnumbered. When you have the story play out in the good guys' HQ, you're basically saying that they're ALL completely incompetent, to the level (and sometimes beyond) the slapstick parodies of the genre like Austin Powers if they can't keep one, unarmed man in a cage, when they all have guns. He might as well have just waved his fingers at them and sent them out for Orange Sherbert because that would have been equally realistic.It's disingenuous, to the point where I'm disengaged and consequently bored. Basically if you paused the film at any point where a decision is made and said 'what's a sensible thing for the good guy to do here?' they'd do the exact opposite, usually to a point way beyond what you think is the most stupid thing possible. The case in point for me: 'One mental case is trying to kill us, what shall we do?' The answer is not 'drive into the middle of nowhere, with no weapons and not tell anyone. That is moronic. What's worst about that, I think, is that it's done from a lazy standpoint where having something look cinematic is far more important than the narrative. I don't think most critics who like this film would let a stand-alone film get away with being this lazy and cynical.I read in another review on here that 'you believe this man *bond* could exist'. Yes, you can. But that's only because there are real people who are also morons. Some of them are alcoholics. Some of them can fight. Some of them may be able to hold their breath under ice cold water for about 2 minutes whilst triangle choking someone, without going into convulsions, having recently been shot with radioactive bullets.A few other quick points. - As has been mentioned elsewhere, jumping someone in the shower that you've barely spoken to, who's lived their life from a pre-teen sex slave, is not cool. It wouldn't be cool if she wasn't a sex slave. - Bardem was charismatic but still, none of the hacking plot made any sense either, as has been pointed out in the highly ranked reviews. - The opening credits were great.But again, to sum it up, either you're going for gritty realism, or you're going for completely nonsensical slapstick. If you're going for realism, don't make some of the most intelligent people on the planet into complete driveling idiots that couldn't make a sensible decision if their nonsensical, not-even-caricatured (because a caricature at least has a foundation in reality), lives depended on it.Why it's most disappointing though; the film did not need to be this stupid and nonsensical. You can have just as much fun but make it at least tenuously believable. Chase them into the Home Alone lair or something - don't have them choose to go their of their own accord. It's not that difficult.So if you like this film, never be snooty about anything like Harry Potter or Twighlight because in the context of the world this film exists in, this Bond film is infinitely more stupid and nonsensical than either of those films. However, if you aren't a snob and just liked it for the nonsense it was, that's all good! My girlfriend is one of you and she's alright with me. :)",2,52,96,9 December 2012
Armageddon," Possibly the stupidest film I've ever seen
","Hey, Mr Bay, I've got 5 words for ya! 'Michael, space is a vacuum!'<ul><li>You can't have fires burning in space. - You can't bank a space ship using wings in space because there is nothing to bank off. - Most poignantly, there is no noise in space. So why is this film so loud?! Bang! Shout! Bang! Boom! Eplode! Shout!</li></ul>This is a film about space and there is absolutely no regard for anything to do with how space works. This film is so dumb that it's the equivalent of doing a film about Olympic diving and having the 'hero' belly flop off the side of the pool and get all 10s to win the gold medal. If the film wasn't so boring, then you can suspend the disbelief but urgh, it is just so dull. The script is terrible, there's no jeopardy, there's no logic anywhere, the acting is awful, the scenery looks like something out of Thunderbirds. Definitely in my 10 worst films ever. It's a shame because I had always wanted to see this film and had expectations that it would be at least middle of the road.",1,4,7,4 January 2012
The Island," My name is Neo.... I mean Lincoln
","This is a dreadful film. I don't know if it was always dreadful or if it's just aged badly in the last 7-8 years but in 2013 (where apparently we'd be half way to having flying trains), it was garbage.First off, the plot is a mish mash of rip offs from other films, visually in particular a complete rip off of The Matrix. This film wishes it was The Matrix though; rather it's The Matrix if it was written for Nicholas Cage. Everything gets explained about 3 times, when really none of it needs explaining because it's so blatantly obvious. The cast for some reason speak the action as if it's a film for the blind. Run! He's coming! I need to swing around for another shot! Oh, he missed! Go! Go! We need to run!All unbelievably boring and obviously full of chase scenes in which things explode for absolutely no reason. My (least) favourite being when a massive truck did a cartwheel because it drove into a giant dumbbell. And just on the date, why did they set it in 2019? This always confuses me about sci-fi films. This one in particular is set just 14 years into the future from the filming date, yet they have flying trains and bikes and the ability to clone humans since, apparently 2015. In the real world, an extension to the London-Manchester-Leeds, non-flying railway got announced and that won't be ready until 2030. 20 years. I mean seriously, just set it in 2060 or something. Just as for the title of my review, I can't believe they actually said 'My name is Lincoln', during a climactic fight scene with the bad guy. Seriously? Whoever wrote/ripped off this script and entire plot must have no shame. Just that one line knocked this down another point from a 3/10 to a 2/10. Still, they probably got paid a fair whack, so if people really don't care, fair play to them, I suppose. How this film's user review first page is full of good reviews though, I have no idea.",2,2,7,5 April 2013
