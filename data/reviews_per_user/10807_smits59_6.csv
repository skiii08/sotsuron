Skyfall," Not good, hardly Bond, but enjoyable.....
","Skyfall is one of those films that has a lot of flaws. For quit a good list of these flaws please see Vijay Dinanath's review. Also nowhere close enough tongue in cheek to be a classic Bond. Also not enough heroism; I don't want to spoil anything but why did the girl have to die? And yet, I enjoyed the total experience of the movie. Mostly because it somehow has a mellow tone. There is no more gore then necessary which is quit an relief from all those way over the gore-top movies. Skyfall is way better and much more enjoyable than any Christopher Nolan movie. Yes it has flaws, lacks logic and humour, but I loved most of it, so 9/10.",9,0,3,13 March 2013
LÃ©on: The Professional," No brains preferred
","Leon is a well acted but poorly written movie. Portman and specially Reno give an very good performance. But Besson fails at every level. The story is nothing less then stupid. OK you get sucked in for about an hour but then the last bit of credibility is lost. Only if you are prepared to believe anything, there is a flick left. I won't go into spoilers but if you believe that when you go give two policemen a headache the whole police-force collapses then this is a great movie. It's just as believable as The Fifth Element but pretends to be much more. If Besson had kept to making a farce it could have been a great movie! But his attempt on 'feelings' makes it an absolute no-brainer. Enjoy but don't think.",6,4,9,30 December 2011
Quantum of Solace," No Bond, but who cares
","Quantum of Solace has close to nothing to do with the James Bond of latter days. This James Bond is not an English scoundrel in a fun world. He is just an silly American action hero with an English accent. But as action flicks go; this is not an unpleasant movie. Poor plot, pointless villain and lack of love-interest for Bond are made up for by an action packed roller coaster. So if you expect an other true Bondmovie you will be disappointed. But for an evening mindless action entertainment this is just fine. Daniel Craig plays an fine action hero. There's a lot of production even though the CGI is sometimes a bit too evident.",8,1,3,15 October 2012
Ex Machina," No big surprise
","The saying Ex Machina is missing a word: Deus, or God. The movie Ex Machina is missing a surprise. The story is about; when is a machine a life form. Some reviews have given this film many stars because of the originality and surprises in the story. But if you've ever read anything by a little known writer by the name of Philip K. Dick, you know; Blade Runner, Jurasic Park, there are no surprises in this movie. Not even the ending. The acting is not to bad but the roles are very stereotypical, unless you've never read mister Dick of course. And there is no action and too little humor to save the movie from being mediocre. Nice idea, been there, done that.",6,0,1,11 September 2015
The Dark Knight," What a joke!
","When a write this, this farce of a movie is ranked 10 in the top 250. Has anyone who rates this movie so highly actually seen it? The timing in almost every action is so unbelievable wrong. Anything happening a split second earlier or later would not have lead to the outcome portrait in the movie. I love comics and the don't have to be logical. But if you a make an illogical movie please make is obvious that you are making a farce. There is no logic in a house that just has been raided by the thugs to be proclaimed as 'the safest place in Gotham'. just a few scenes later. Don't make everything as realistic as possible, make a comic-movie. The badman-series where lovely to watch because they understood this to be true. OK, the acting is not to bad but almost all the action is horrible predictable.",2,6,11,1 May 2010
Moon," What a stinker
","Moon is an incredible bad movie. Un-original, bad continuity, horrible acting. How can this stinker of a movie score so high on IMDb? Everything in this movie has been done before and has been done better. In an other movie an other computer behaves outside of it's program. But in the other movie (2001 of course) there is a reason. In Moon there is not, it just does. In Moon the lead character does not wear a spacesuit in his buggy. That is of course unless the script has the buggy break down later on, then he wears his suit. Oh, and the main character is very vulnerable, unless he has to stow away as cargo that is shot at 25 G's into space then he becomes superman. No more about this movie; it's a extreme stinker. It would even stink on the airless moon.",2,7,19,21 June 2013
