The Incredible Hulk," Pointless
","I just finished Hulk, expecting something similarly entertaining than Iron Man or at least F4. I was disappointed, and I wonder how bad Lee's attempt really must be if this is one is considered the better one.There is nothing original or surprising in this movie. It's made with absolutely no spirit at all, bland as a mouthful of flour. The story is extraordinary simple, the acting is wooden and characters act stupid more often than not (even the non-hulky ones), the music sounds as if stolen from any number of previous movies.Sit this one out and wait for yet another sequel, one day they have to do it right.",Null,4,7,21 September 2008
