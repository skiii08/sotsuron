Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I Give Up
","Am I supposed to think it a coincidence that Jar Jar sounds so much like another floppy eared cartoon in a live action film? Could he be a more blatant homage to Roger Rabbit? I actually prefer big rubber aliens that don't move to these goofy animations. Switching back and forth between live actors and cartoons of the same actors in impossible situations is even worse, for example, cartoon Qui Gon jumping into Amidala's ship to escape fight with Maul. Don't get me started on Jabba, big rubber alien much better again than cartoon. It seems when poor Greedo died the best alien effects died with him. As for immaculate conception of Ani, I did suspect a ruse. I thought for sure we would discover that a Sith had raped her and she'd blocked it out. Thankfully the movie has continuity with previous films by placing great actors in supporting roles, and amateurs as leads. Hopefully a different director will take the reigns in future, someone who remembers the original vision of the classic hero's journey depicted for the first time in space.",7,0,1,3 January 2006
