Hereditary," There is something called logic...
","I am 45 years old and I am a movie buff. I can stand mistakes in movies, I can stand bad performances, I can stand bad special effects, I can even stand bad jokes. But if there is one thing that I can not stand is when directors, screenwriters and/or producers believe that those who watch the film don't have a brain. Well, apparently many don't work but some of us have one that works properly... I don't know how the laws are in the United States, but in my country if I accidentally kill my sister, decapitating her, I am quite sure that my life would be a complete disaster for several months due to the rigorous police investigations.However, nothing happens in this film, not a single mention of any investigation, no police, no detective, nothing at all...
The mother tries to burn the book and the sleeve of the shirt begins to burn. She tries to put out the fire in her shirt and she does not get it. Any human being with a pair of neurons takes off his shirt or looks for water, but no, she takes the book out of the fireplace and extinguishes the fire in the book. Nice logic...
Ok, for a moment I will continue the game and suppose that my neurons have died each and every one of them and therefore I can't think clearly and I will ignore those two facts.
The movie is boring from start to finish. It does not scare at any time. There is nothing in it that has not been seen other times and therefore it is completely predictable.
I have scored it with a 1 only to equate the mindless who believe that this is a masterpiece. If it were not for them I would have put a 3. So bad is this 'movie'.",1,4,10,26 December 2018
