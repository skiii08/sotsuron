The King's Speech," Typical Sunday afternoon movie
","The King's speech' is a type of movie you can watch at Sunday afternoon after lunch . When the ending credits will appear,you will be probably sleeping at that time . When you wake up you won't even remember what kind of movie you were watching . You will move on with your life just like nothing had happened at all.This movie is neither funny or sad . It isn't boring , but it isn't very interesting either. It isn't empty , but it's not too deep either . I can't say it's a bad movie , but I can't say it's a good movie either . For me a good movie is something that stays with you . Something that makes you think or makes you cry or laugh . I like movies that I can remember despite I haven't seen them for long time.'The King's speech' is a 'meh' movie for me . I don't necessary regret watching it , but I've got a feeling that I could use my time more wisely . The movie was mildly interesting and I'm sure that after few days I will forget about it completely.Colin Firth , Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter were all great. They deserve their awards. 'TKS' is nicely photographed by Danny Cohen . The costumes and art-direction are top-notch. The screenplay and direction aren't bad , but I don't think they deserved the Oscar nominees.Overall this movie is not a disaster , but it certainly didn't deserve the title of 'The best movie of 2010'. I give it 5/10.",5,2,6,15 June 2013
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," More of the same
","*SPOILERS * SPOILERS * SPOILERS * SPOILERS * SPOILERSThis sequel is a combination of the elements from previous movie plus many cliché elements. Once again the screenplay will make our heroes to go from place to another just for the sake of the movie going. Once again the action scenes will suck . Once again the music will be unimpressive. Even the final treasure chambers will look terribly familiar to the first movie.Add to that an annoying character of main heroes mother (really ? Father wasn't enough ?) , the boring Ed Harris as the villain , the irritating 'we need the second chair ' and the obnoxious final . So , in the labyrinth full of traps only villains die ? None of the heroes will even break a finger ? PLEASE. And the last second change of heart for Harris character was PATHETIC. Even more pathetic than the 'President is a noble man and cool guy ' cliché that 'National treasure 2' uses with no shame at all. And don't forget about 'they broke up , but will be together once again' cliché.The good things ? Once again the humor is real good. Justin Barthe is still great as comic relief and Diane Kruger is still cute. Nicolas Cage sucks still.I give it 3/10.",3,0,0,11 August 2013
The Incredible Hulk," Nothing incredible in this movie
","This is a reboot of Hulk franchise after not quite fair negative response from both audience and critics of Ang Lee 'The Hulk'. 'The Incredible Hulk' goes completely different way than Ang Lee . This is no drama with serious ambitions , but simple and mindless popcorn action flick.The obvious problem lies in the screenplay . The story is predictable , full of clichés and the characters are barely written . Maybe that's the reason why the actors can't show anything interesting. There are some nice jokes here and the movie has many easter eggs for Hulk fans (cameo of Stan Lee , cameo of Lou Ferrigno , the jokes with pants , the 'Lonely man' theme). The bland direction from Louis Letterier doesn't help either , just as the rather awful CGI.Edward Norton is a good actor , but she doesn't show here anything that any other actor could show. Tim Ruth is terribly weak and almost becomes a parody of himself. William Hurt is nice as the general Ross , especially considering that he's stuck in a very one-dimensional role. The worst performance of the movie certainly belongs to Liv Tyler . Not only she's been cast as the scientist Betty Ross , which is unbelievable , but her over dramatic performance gave me many laughs.The fans of Hulk were rather pleased with this one . Other viewers will be rather disappointed with this quite boring movie . It's got nothing to impress the audience – no substance , no interesting action. A pretty forgettable movie only for die-hard comic book fans. I give it 2/10.",2,1,3,30 November 2013
Requiem for a Dream," Primitive drama for MTV- generation
","*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS'Requiem for a dream 'obviously has got strong acting . Jennifer Connelly shows much more talent here than in her awarded performance in 'Beautiful mind' ( by the way it was good performance) . Ellen Burstyn was rightfully nominated for Oscar for her performance as the mother of main hero. Jared Leto isn't bad either and Aronofsky deserves some respect for turning Wayans into a serious actor (at least for one movie).The music by Clint Mansell is a classic by now . Strong , haunting , memorable. As a visual experience 'Requiem' is also attractive . The montage took a lot of work and time to look so impressive . They should nominate 'Requiem ' for best editing.Putting aside the technical strengths and good acting , ' Requiem for a dream' fails as a movie for me. The whole thing feels like a MTV drama . It's loud , colorful , sometimes shocking and as deep as average music video shown on that channel.Many people who praise 'Requiem' admits that they have seen the movie only once , because they were to afraid to watch it again . I strongly recommend that you should watch this movie at least 2-3 times . If you watch it only once the shock might fool you that you have seen something deep and thought provoking . If you watch it again you will notice how cold , calculated and mechanical this movie really is . Drugs are bad – says Aronofsky and that's really the only thing he has got to say . Everything else is just a distraction.The characters are barely written . The relationship between Leto and Burstyn , love between Leto and Connelly , friendship between Leto and Wayans – it's all incredibly thin and barely touched . Connelly's character is an terrible cliché – daughter of a rich people , she feels unloved because her parents care only about money , she feels lonely , her parents are far away and left her with a guardian , bla bla bla . If it wasn't for Connelly I wouldn't care about her character at all . She was able to bring some soul into such lame character . The movie also never explains or develops Wayans past ( one flashback with his mother and that's it ? Really ?) same as never gives the viewers a little bit more information on Leto's and Burstyn's family life.'Requiem' also has got some serious plot problems . Connelly is a daughter of rich people. They give her lot of money , yet when she needs the money the most , in critical situation of the story , they 'magically' disappear not leaving any trace where they can be . The powerful drug dealer that rules the whole town has incredible money and power . Yet , he's not able to find a girl for himself !? That's a chance for Connelly to get some money ?! In real life he would be surrounded by at least few girl's , but not here . Here Aronofsky needs to break Connelly's character emotionally , so he crates two terribly unrealistic situations for a large dramatic effect.I think it's stupid that Leto kept injecting drugs in ONE PLACE OF HIS BODY . Even when his arm is ALL PURPLE AND LOOKING F****** TERRIBLE ?! Seriously , how stupid is that ?! I'm not a junkie , but I wouldn't never do that . I've seen also a documentary about junkies . They inject drugs in different places on the body to prevent danger . They aren't retarded as the movie suggest. And it's no way possible that doctor in hospital would call police first and not take care of the sick arm first . I also 'love' the description of America in this movie. EVERY doctor , cop or prison guard is a cold blooded sadist or uncaring bastard at best . So you see , our heroes are living in such OPPRESIVE country that they HAD TO become junkies .The ending of the movie is basically an marathon of torture for each hero. Aronofsky plays with viewers emotions in a rather primitive way (4 tragedies combined together instead of one). 'Saw' has more subtlety. Funny thing – on repeated viewings , when the element of surprise is gone , you will find that there's no heart , no real emotion hidden in 'Requiem'.I give it 5/10 . Maybe the pure shock will keep some people away from drugs . That's a good thing . Except that , 'Requiem' is more of MTV video instead of art . Style over substance . More shock than a message. Movies like 'Naked lunch ' or 'Fear and loathing in Las Vegas' are better movies about drugs.",5,3,5,4 August 2013
The Expendables 2," Good tribute to old school action movies
","'The Expendables 2' is a slight improvement over the first movie. It's very funny , very charming B-class movie that is proud of what it is. A big , funny , nicely made summer blockbuster that wants to entertain as an action fairytale. People who don't like this movie because it's unrealistic , cheesy and over the top forgot one thing – it was INTENTIONAL . The movie is a great love letter to old school action movies . To the movies that were full of testosterone . When one hero could defeat a whole army . Where one-liners and jokes were brilliantly cheesy and bad . Where heroes were larger than life and so were the villains. The movie keeps joking about itself and makes countless references to classic action movies.Stallone has been replaced by Simon West ('Con air') as the director. It's a good decision , because his direction is superior than Stallone's from the first movie. 'Expendables 2' is full of energy , and never boring or too serious for it's own good (another flaw of the original movie). There are some moral dilemmas here , but thankfully they aren't heavy handed and give the movie some kind of heart and depth.The movie makes a better use of the all star cast. Dolph Lundgren is great as comic relief . Jason Statham has two really nice fights. Jet Li appears for only first 15 minutes , but was able to show his fighting skills. Stallone is more convincing as the leader of the group. Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger who were wasted in the first movie actually take part in action and give us their charisma and famous one liners.The newcomers are also fun . Chuck Norris is adorable when he makes fun of himself. Jean Claude Van Damme is really good as the villain and definitely a better choice for that role than Eric Roberts.There are some flaws. One new hero isn't really that interesting and the subplot involving him left me cold. Van Damme doesn't have too much time . Some jokes are rather flat. There is a love story here that is definitely undeveloped and feels unnecessary.Plenty of cartoon violence , destruction and carnage. Big explosions . Lovely silly dialogue . I felt like a kid once again. They simply don't make them like this anymore. It's a shame. Too many action movies are dead serious and this one was a welcomed change of style.If you like 'Commando' , 'Cobra' , 'Tango and Cash' and so on you'll be satisfied . If you like more serious action movies , please go somewhere else. I give it 7/10.",7,0,0,28 July 2013
Source Code," Idiotic movie from beginning to the end
","*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS I didn't liked Duncan's Jones previous movie 'Moon' which had positive reception , despite my opinion that it was poor man's '2001 Space odyssey'. This movie is even worse . 'Moon' at least had good acting , music and art direction. 'Source code' doesn't have anything to defend itself.The story obviously has been inspired by movies like Groundhog day' , 12 monkeys' , 'Memento' , Deja vu' or Inception'. It's hard to find something truly original nowadays , so the lack of originality isn't a sin here. However the fact that Jones managed to create a dull nonsense based on such good movies is something that cannot be left without a comment.One has to remember that real life Source Code isn't a computer program. In the movie the source code is a computer program which creates a worm hole to plug any consciousness into other similar parallel universes it can locate based on its input data. Here we have all the minds on the train whose last 8 minutes of existence have been recaptured to locate the exact time, place and event that the army wants Gyllenhaal's consciousness to be plugged into.The problems here start from the beginning. How can you create an entire fully-interactive alternate reality based on somebody's memory ? MEMORY by definition is s something fixed that can't be changed or interacted with. How do you create an alternate reality at all ? Creating alternate realities and being able to recover the last 8 minutes of a dead person's memory are two concepts that have absolutely NOTHING in common. Those are two SEPARATE ideas badly combined together. The plot's ideas are far-fetched and they're not even consistent or logical. It's impossible to suspend disbelief.At one point we learn that 'some part' of the main character's brain is 'still functioning'. It would be absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to undertake the complex tasks he does with only 'some part' of his brain. And why the army won't tell Gyllenhaal what's going on ? They send him time after time after time without telling him about the situation ! How he or anybody else in his situation was about to solve the mystery without any information ?! It's not until five Gyllenhaal's failure they decide to tell him about the program , bomb , terrorist , his situation and what they want from him. Jesus , it's like sending a recruit to war without any weapon or training WHY does army and Gyllenhaal think the person detonating the bomb is ON THE TRAIN when it blows up ?! They know about the second attack , so it's obvious that the person responsible couldn't blown himself up. No solid reason is ever given for why his commanders are so incredibly sure the suspect was even on the train ANYWHERE CLOSE to that 8 minute window he keeps visiting to begin with Other issues – Jake Gyllenhaal is an SOLDIER ?! God save America ! The love story between Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan not only is morally wrong , but also completely forced , unbelievable and unnecessary. The terrorist is just one man who was able to CREATE ATOMIC BOMB BY HIMSELF. I know it's possible to create a bomb by yourself, but NOT an atomic bomb (without skills , money or equipment) ! And how do you sent SMS from one universe to other ?! This film is a whodunit and the guilty person in this movie is obvious from the beginning. The question is answered by the first candidate the audience suspects, but the last the protagonist bothers checking. 'Source code' suffers from being repetitive since Gyllenhaal repeats the same 8 minutes over and over again. The characters are uninteresting and rather dull. The movie doesn't have any heart , despite the lame subplot with hero's father. The acting is terribly bland , special effects mediocre and the dialogs completely forgettable.What is the meaning of the movie ? That we should appreciate every second of our lives ? that there is a parallel universe to ours ? That we should be nice for each other ? This comes from a 'visionary' director ?! It's terrible cliché . The ending is lame , totally unconvincing and denies the 'logic' of the universe Jones created (not that there was any logic in this movie from the beginning) . Terrible movie that pretends to be smart . It's not science fiction , but BULLS*** FICTION. I give it 1/10.",1,2,10,20 September 2014
Catch Me If You Can," A movie worth catching and watching
","This movie is based on real story . Since this is a Hollywood movie probably some things were changed , but that doesn't really matter . What is important is this movie entertains . It's long , 2 hours and few minutes , yet it's never boring . It's set during the 60's and 70's and the humor in 'Catch me if you can' reminds me humor from movies from that time. My favorite joke is the 'knock, knock' joke from Hanks.The opening credits sequence is brilliant. It's one of the best opening sequences ever. DiCaprio fits in his role well with his boyish look .Tom Hanks is nice as the grumpy FBI agent. Christopher Walken steals the show with his performance as the charming , always optimistic father of our hero. He deserved Oscar nomination. It was also good to see Martin Sheen and Amy Adams. Jennifer Garner appearance was rather pointless.The tricks that DiCaprio uses look believable . I can only complain that he acts a little bit stupid during the second half of the movie , but maybe that's how it was in the real life ? Anyway the movie provides good fun . There is some depth here . Both DiCaprio and Hanks are lonely people who have nothing more than their jobs . Spielberg also tries to explain why Frank Abagnale Jr. started his criminal career . His explanation sounds logical – he was running away because he couldn't deal with his parents marriage problems (He was 16 years old then). 'Catch me if you can' is a well made fluff entertainment. I give it 8/10.",7,2,3,8 November 2013
Iron Man 3," Why I didn't like Iron man 3'
","*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS 1. A dark and gritty movie about Iron man ? I was skeptical before I saw the movie and sadly my fears were confirmed. What works for grim heroes like Batman , Daredevil and Punisher doesn't work for light and colorful character like Tony Stark. All those deep themes like 'You betrayed your beliefs' or 'Terrorism is bad' were just unconvincing and annoying.2. The 9/11 references worked well in 'The Dark knight trilogy' , but here they feel completely forced and unnecessary.3. The love story between Tony and Pepper is TOO melodramatic.4. The whole Tony suffers insomnia and panic attacks after the events of 'Avengers' on paper seems like a good idea , but it was very heavy handed here. Not to mention that all those panic attacks 'magically' disappear after the kid gives Tony advice 'You're a mechanic. Build something'. Despite all the bad things happening later , Tony doesn't show any sign of panic attacks to the end of movie.5. The idea of showing that Tony is a hero without the suit is good , but was badly done. I mean when Tony fights with the mutant woman or defeats the guards in Miami it's simply unrealistic. When and where he did learn to do that ? Bruce Wayne had martial arts training , but Tony Stark didn't. Yet , he defeated the guards and woman without any problem in style of Jason Bourne. For further insult near the end of the movie Tony shows that he can't shoot at all.6. Tony announces his home address ON TV FOR THE WHOLE WORLD TO KNOW. I understand he was mad at Mandarin at that time , but this was simply STUPID. He endangered himself not only Mandarin , but also to journalists , fans and other people. He wouldn't have any kind of privacy after that.7. Tony's mansion is well equipped with wonderful gadgets and technology , yet it doesn't have any kind of security. No alarms , no force field , no nothing .8. When somebody attacks your home you have to fight with him wearing a prototype suit that will almost certainly fail you at the most unwanted moment.9. I find it totally unbelievable that Tony and Maya survived the missile attack. Pepper had the suit , so it's not strange that she survived , but the others should turn into pieces of meat.10. Quaillan motivations for revenge on Tony Stark seems to be based on the fact that Stark wasn't nice to him. I'm sorry , but that's just lame.11. The twist with Mandarin was rather predictable. Mostly , because Ben Kingsley wasn't one bit convincing in that part. Sure , when the 'secret' was out he was good as the drunk actor , but not as Mandarin.12. Quaillan as the main villain isn't really interesting , despite good performance by Guy Pearce. It would be much better if Mandarin really was the main villain and a faithful one to the comics.13. I'm sick of another Hollywood movie when the president of USA is basically saint.14. Gwyneth Paltrow in black bikini and with superpowers defeating the main villain ? PATHETIC.15. Don Cheadle just like in 'Iron man 2' proves here that he doesn't fit the part of Rhodes/War Machine at all. Terrence Howard was MUCH better.16. Tony had AN ARMY OF IRON MAN'S all this time , yet like a lost idiot he called them at the very end ! Why ?! He could called them from the moment the kid repaired Jarvis . At least one of them . It would certainly made things easier for him , but NOOOOOOO.17. Tony had to wear electromagnet in last two 'Iron man' movies to survive because there was no other way for him to live. Here , 'magically' , without no explanation he simply removes them thanks to an operation. HOW ?! I thought it was impossible to do ?!The special effects are good , the humor is nice and the acting is solid , but otherwise this is a completely disappointing sequel. The story is dumb , the action scenes lack excitement and the movie takes itself way too seriously. I give it 4/10.",4,0,3,9 April 2014
Deja Vu," Bad time travel movie but fairly entertaining
","The acting here is very decent - Denzel Washington , Val Kilmer and Jim Caviezel are all very OK. The film is a nice eye candy which isn't strange considering that this is a Tony Scott movie. There is also a nice and quite inventive car chase that happens in both past and present (watch the movie and you will understand what I'm talking about).The screenplay is however poor. * Why an Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms agent is investigating terrorist activity and a murder scene, which should surely be the province of the police, FBI or Homeland Security. * The terrorist has no motive for his madness * US government has a time machine that needs a lot of energy just to send a piece of paper in to the past (it knocked out the whole city power). Yet when Denzel goes back in time the problem is miraciolusly solved ! * Denzel is so strong he only needs a couple of hours to recover from dying * Denzel only needs to wash his wound to stop it from bleeding * Why send Denzel instead of sending a note to the police from the past ? * The movie ends with a paradox that is very confusing to explain or understand (look the IMDb FAQ for this movie).It's fairly entertaining , but dumb and mostly predictable movie. I give it 3/10.",3,0,1,31 December 2013
Unbreakable," Great tribute to and deconstruction of comic books
","'Unbreakable' was a movie that many had high expectations after the surprising success of 'The Sixth sense' . The movie was met with mixed reactions . The next movie 'Signs' also divided people and 'The Village' can me called a breaking point of M. Night Shyamalan's career. His next movies became more and more worse and right now hardly anyone takes Shyamalan seriously. It's sad , because I really think that 'The Sixth sense' , 'Unbreakable' and 'Signs' while are not without flaws , are certainly good movies . The first two are great and deserve to appear on 'the best movies ever' list . 'Unbreakable' might be the best of Shyamalan movies . It stands better on repeated viewings than 'The Sixth sense' . The ending is more logical and unpredictable and the whole movie doesn't seem to really too heavy on the surprising ending than it's famous 'older brother'. It's like a cherry on the top of delicious cake rather than the main attraction of the movie. The somber mood stays with you and whole picture really feels like a work of art , not entertainment. It does have few things in common with 'Sixth sense' (Willis , atmosphere , twist endings , supernatural undertones) , but please watch it as an completely separate movie.This movie takes time for buildup of atmosphere, strong character interaction, and it's heavily centered on characters and their psychology. Shyamalan might be the best director since Hitchcock with his ability to create suspense. Fall on the stairs , drowning in the swimming pool , the fight – those scenes are really breathtaking and magical.'Unbreakable' walks a fine line between being realistic and comic bookish. This movie precedes 'Batman begins' as the first superhero movie grounded in reality. It is however a psychological thriller , not an action movie. What if superhero did exist in real life ? Is Jackson's character right about Willis ? Shyamalan gives the audience many subtle hints that will become clear if you watch the movie again. There are many clever visual symbols , dialogue lines or camera angels that are references to comic books. They are also hints foreshadowing the ending of the movie. If you are a comic book fan you will probably notice them quicker than the rest of audience. As for the ending that was often criticized – it's perfect the way it is. It's a deconstruction of comic book logic. What happens here is what would happen in real life. It's pretty much goes against comic book fans expectations , just like the whole plot of this movie. It's sad that people weren't ale to see this.Bruce Willis (for the second time in a row works with Shyamalan) creates a completely convincing portrayal of average Joe with depression and family problems . There is a aura of sadness around him and that's says something about his acting skills. He's certainly more capable actor than the typical tough guy he often plays. What Willis does here is so subtle that many half-intelligent viewers will say that his not acting at all. Samuel L. Jackson is creepy , mysterious yet sympathetic at the same time. He's got a great chemistry with Willis (just like in 'Die hard with a vengeance'). There's something bizarre in him (in a positive way). As for the supporting characters Spencer Clark is great as Willis son and Robin Wright Penn is solid as Willis wife.Director of Photography Eduardo Serra did a great job . He used dark, slightly blue colored filter for most of movie time to create an haunting atmosphere . The movie does look really like a comic book with some of the camera angles. James Newton Howard also deserves praise for his silent , yet powerful soundtrack. The music during the fight is quite chilling.'Unbreakable' is a movie about many things – about dysfunctional family, how comics have shaped popular culture in the 20th century and became modern myth , it wonders about the origins of evil and good , what it means to be a hero , about destiny and self realization. Too bad that the potential franchise was killed by the inpatient audience . Today , people get bored very quickly . If only they knew what they miss I give it 8/10.",8,0,0,30 November 2013
Kickboxer," The Muscles from Brussels goes to Thailand
","This is one of best Van Damme movies right there with 'Bloodsport'. In some ways I like 'Kickboxer' even more than 'Bloodsport'. It's a simple revenge story that makes a good use of Van Damme's fighting skills. In this movie we explore the martial arts fundamentals of Muay Thai. It's the national sport of Thailand, where the fighter will condition his body so that his arms and legs become weapons capable of delivering blows, kicks in particular, that are three times as powerful as that of any ordinary martial artist. He'll also use his feet, fists, shins, and elbows too. It's the de facto fighting style for mixed martial arts.The acting here is a mixed bag. Van Damme is very hammy and Dennis Alexio has no talent at all . On the other hand Dennis Chan is a good copy of Mr. Myiagi from 'Karate kid' as Xian Chow and Haskell V. Anderson III is fun as Winston Taylor a retired Vietnam War veteran. Let's not forget about Michel Qissi who is unforgettable as the main villain - Tong Po. Tong Po is mistakenly billed as playing himself (on the film's credits). Qissi can also be seen in two other Van Damme movies 'Bloodsport' and 'Lionheart'. He also appeared in sequel to this movie - 'Kickboxer 2'.There are some really cool scenes here - Van Damme training with the dog , the drunk fight in the bar , Van Damme and the palm , final fight with the hands bound with glass. The soundtrack here is unfortunately forgettable and can't compare to the one in 'Bloodsport'.I give it 6/10. 'Kickboxer' is a cheesy , lighthearted , entertaining little action movie. A small classic. Co-directed by Mark DiSalle and David Worth it's well paced with nice fight scenes. The producers decided to franchise out this series. Other movies are unwatchable. Stick with this fun little time waster.",6,2,2,11 September 2018
Iron Man 2," Thin story saved by special effects and humor
","Iron man 2' is full of ideas that are undeveloped . It's a shame , because there was potential here. The writer starts a subplot and leaves it not really going anywhere with it. The health troubles , conflict with the army , problems of loyalty , Vankow's desire of revenge The movie doesn't explore any of this subplots and they are all too quickly resolved.There is no real plot here. There's a bunch of ideas thrown together in hope that somehow they will make a good story. The more I think about it the more I realize that 'Iron man 2' had only one real purpose – introduce Natasha that will be important in the 'Avengers' movie. Ironically , her presence here is pretty much pointless (except looking pretty and some action near the end of movie).The movie doesn't know what to do with it's characters. Ivan Vankow and Justin Hammer who were supposed to be main villains don't really do anything through entire movie. Vankow has two fight scenes and that's it . For the rest of movie he is constructing a weapon , while Hammer just waits. Vankow isn't one bit interesting or scary character. His motivation to attack Stark doesn't have any real importance to overall story. The writer could also do much more with Justin Hammer.The performances are good with the exception of Scarlett Johansson and Don Cheadle. Johansson is boring , while Don Cheadle is very stiff. I missed Terence Howard . The plot is thin with some plot holes. I also couldn't buy the new element. I know this is a comic book movie , but that was just stupid.'Iron man 2' is a disappointing sequel. The thin story is saved by the humor and brilliant special effects. The movie was obviously enjoyable enough to be a box office success. The next movie was even dumber than this one despite a more serious attempt at writing a story. 'Iron man 2' at least doesn't take itself too seriously and works as popcorn movie. I give it 3/10.",3,2,4,21 June 2014
Rocky V," People love comebacks ? Well , not always
","The idea of making a fifth movie about Rocky Balboa was very risky. The story was already getting thin with third movie and the forth one is watchable only when you don't take it seriously. This fifth movie reunites Stallone and John Avildsen (The director of original 'Rocky') together for the first time since 14 years . After the over the top 'Rocky 4' this one was supposed to be a back to the roots. A serious drama.Unfortunately this movie is a failure. The direction of Avildsen is very cheesy at places (Rocky remembering Mick , the hip hop soundtrack , pathos in the final fight). Most of the problems come from the screenplay. The characters of Rocky , Paulie and Adrian haven't really changed and to watch for the fifth time the same characters acting the same way is just annoying. Not to mention that Stallone . Young and Shire overact in their dramatic scenes here. And 'Rocky 5' does feel similar at times to 'Rocky 2' (the money problems , becoming an ordinary person once again).The story on paper looks good , but as a movie it's a cheap morality story about loyalty, greed and father-son relationship. The screenplay isn't subtle with dealing of all those things. It's hard to believe that Rocky would forget about his son so easily and gave everything to Tommy. Sure , I understand why he did it (because he was in that way still fighting on the ring) , but it feels just too convenient. Same goes for his conflict wit Tommy . The whole potential is killed by sappiness and morality preaching. Not to mention the black and white morality. Tommy Gunn is one-dimensional asshole through all the movie . He could be a tragic figure (he's got a troubled past) , but the one dinner talk is just too little . The boxing manager George Duke is also annoyingly one-dimensional villain.The good things are the funny dialogues and as always the music by Bill Conti. Also , the fight scenes are done well and the movie isn't boring. All in all it's just too little to save this unwanted and unnecessary sequel . Thankfully , 'Rocky Balboa' was a great farewell to Rocky. I give it 3/10.",3,4,9,16 November 2013
Public Enemies," Another disappointing movie from Michael Mann
","After 'Miami vice' this is another bad movie that Michael Mann made lately. I was expecting something like a mix between 'Heat' and 'The Untouchables' . I always had a soft spot for movies set in the 30's . Add to that a cast involving Johnny Depp , Christian Bale and Marion Cottilard and no wonder that my expectations were high.Ugh. Where should I start ? First of all the movie looks UGLY. I HATED the use of digital camera. It was already bad in 'Miami vice' and 'Collateral'. Here it completely destroys any mood . The atmosphere of the 30's is gone , despite nice costumes and art direction. I couldn't forget that I was watching the movie because of that f***ing digital camera. Not to mention that the action scenes look terribly fake and lack any excitement.The screenplay is rather bad. The movie never gives us any good reason to care for Depp. His character is rather unlikable from the beginning to the end. The whole Robin Hood theme is never explored. Bale is stuck with a role that is completely dull . He doesn't have too much screen time and Mann doesn't really seem to care about him . We only get a post epilogue information about Pelvis that I couldn't care less about. I also found it hard to care for Cottilard's character for some reason. The story itself is never particularly interesting or surprising. There is one stupid scene with the police station.Depp and Cottilard are OK , despite the fact that their characters are VERY underwritten . Bale gives a bad performance , but in his defense his character is so boring and uninteresting that I felt sorry for him. I've heard that Bale was in conflict with Mann during making the movie and maybe his limited screen time and ad performance is a result of that ? The opening jail scene and the ending scene are quite nice and the best thing in the movie. Everything else is just filler. The result is one boring movie that can't be compared to 'Heat' or 'The Untouchables'. It is however slightly better than 'Miami vice'. I give it 2/10.",2,1,2,20 September 2014
Oldboy," Stupid and disgusting
","*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS* I don't know why this movie has such high rating . Maybe it's because Quentin Tarantino likes it , so people feel like they have to like it too ? Who knows. I heard rumors that Hollywood wants to make an American remake of this one . Spielberg is supposed to be the director and Will Smith the main star . I can't imagine that , but hey . The whole world is getting crazier with each day , so why not .The movie is based on comic book I haven't heard or read . It's manga , so expect a lot of kung fu fights , shouting and twisted psychology.I treat 'Oldboy' as a thriller . When I'm watching a thriller I'm expecting logic . I don't know if the viewers who liked 'Oldboy' treat is a some sort of fantasy , but for me it was a total disaster in terms of realism and logic.1) Our hero is a prisoner . He's been locked in a apartment . In the middle of the city . The WHOLE building is a prison , where EVERY apartment is basically a cage. And I thought that when you kidnap somebody you hide him outside of the city limits or something like that 2) Our hero for 15 YEARS EATS THE SAME MEAL for breakfast , lunch and dinner . What about vitamins , proteins and so on ? After a week he would be sick . After a month he would probably die . Yet , he's alive and in good health . Magic , I guess or he's a terminator.3) You can't hypnotize anybody AGAINST HIS WILL . You need the patient to cooperate with the hypnotist.4) You won't learn kung fu if you will be PUNCHING THE WALL WITH ONE FIST FOR 15 YEARS.5) I guess eating live octopus is a deep symbol of something 6) You can rape a woman in the elevator and walk away with no problem . Despite having at least two witness , the police wont be even searching for you.7) The love between our hero and the most important female character is nonexistent , despite what the movie tells us 8) Our hero is in the same age as the villain . They went to the same school , same year , same class . Yet , our hero looks like 40 or 50 years old , while the villain is maximum 30 years old. Judging by the look our hero could be his father ! 9) The sex scene is one of the most awful sex scenes I've ever seen.10) You can defeat army of opponents with no problem , yet when you are angry one guy will defeat you without the problem.11) Who's that woman ? Why she helps the villain in the beginning ? Why she helps the hero in the end ? Does she have personal reasons ? 12) The ending message is beautiful – incest is good as long as nobody knows about it. Brother and sister or father and daughter should LOVE EACH OTHER NOT ONLY EMOTIONALLY , BUT ALSO PSYCHICALLY What is wrong with you people ? What about logic or good taste ? This movie feels like an adaptation of one of those porn fan-fiction that Internet is full of . Incest appeared before in one famous movie from the 70's , but that movie never said it was a good thing ! That's the only 'message' I saw . The authors of the comic book , the creators of the movie and the fans of the movie need to be locked in mental hospital.I give it 2/10 , because the music is beautiful.",2,10,24,21 July 2013
Insomnia," Conscience never sleeps
","This is important movie in Nolan's directing career . After the success of 'The Following' and especially 'Memento' (two low budget thrillers) he got a chance to direct a big budget movie . He had chosen to create a remake of Swedish thriller – 'Insomnia'. It's not really hard to understand why . The Swedish original deals with themes and elements that Nolan talks about in his movies – the obsession , useful lie , morally ambiguous main hero , thin line between good and evil , women catalyst the plot , hero losing his grip on reality and the feel of neo-noir movie.It's interesting that this is Nolan's only movie that wasn't written by him . Every other movie he made was either written by him or co-written . Here Hilary Seitz is the only writer , although Nolan did consult the screenplay with him. I haven't seen the Swedish original , but from what I've heard this movie isn't a shot by shot remake and few things were changed. For more on the changes you should see the IMDb FAQ .'Insomnia' seems less impressive compared to Nolan's earlier and later thrillers . Maybe because it feels like a rather conventional story . While other Nolan's thrillers either explored unknown grounds ('The Prestige' , 'Inception') or were told in creative non-chronological way ('The Following' , 'Memento') here 'Insomnia' feels very un-Nolan like. Maybe it's because Seitz is the writer . The dialogue don't have that certain rhythm or British humor . Many little plot twists that change the situation don't appear here . The story is rather linear (with the exception of flashbacks) . Some people even don't know that this movie was made by Nolan.It doesn't mean that 'Insomnia' isn't worth watching . Hell no. Since this is a cat and mouse game between cop and killer , where all the cards are put on the table from the beginning , Nolan tries different things here . The movie is much slower than his other movies . This time is all about the mood. Wally Pfister captures the cold beauty of Alaska well . The thriller is also very atmospheric and manages to capture how main hero is losing his grip on reality thanks to insomnia. There are two great scenes here : the shootout and the chase scene.The movie relies heavily on the psychological tension between the hero and the villain . Without good actors 'Insomnia' would fell apart . Here , Al Pacino gives one of his better performance , especially in recent years , as the tired of fighting injustice cop . This movie also shows Nolan's sixth sense when it comes to inspired casting – Robin Williams. Before 'Insomnia' and 'One hour photo' people would laugh at the idea that Williams would play a criminal . Here , he gives he's character some truly disturbing creepiness hiding under quite sympathetic face. His character comes out like a cynical weirdo who doesn't seems to notice that he's doing bad things. The chemistry between Pacino and Williams in on of the strongest things in the movie.Hilary Swank seems to not have as much screen time as she needs and her character isn't too expanded . Too bad , because she feels quite crucial to the story . Also , the ending is kinda a letdown in that way it's not impressive and feels uninspired.'Insomnia' is a good thriller that asks important question : how far would you go to defeat evil ? In a way it's a take on Dostoyevsky's 'Crime and punishment'. I love the metaphor here – conscience never sleeps . Just for that 'Insomnia' is worth watching. Nolan's weakest movie yet is still a good movie. I give it 7/10.",7,1,2,23 August 2013
500 Days of Summer," The best romantic comedy ever made ?
","This is a strong candidate for the title of best romantic comedy . Unlike most of the movies of this genre it has at least something to tell . It's deeper and has something to say. It doesn't have the same generic plot – X meets Y , they fell in love,there are trouble , there is conflict , love wins all , the end. It is REALLY FUNNY and more mature than typical Hollywood product.This movie feels real. Joseph Gordon Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are stars , yet they feel like real everyday people. The idea for movie is simple , yet genius . One of them believes in love, the other not . Can they be happy together ? Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel have great chemistry together and give solid performances. They relationship feels real and makes you care for both of them.The movie makes a great job of mixing humor and sadness . It shows the beautiful and ugly sides of love. It's a good thing that the story isn't told in a linear way . It makes a point how we want to remember some good things and how we intentionally forget about bad things. The editing is really good . The movie is quite nicely photographed. The direction by Mark Webb is full of life. The scene with Gordon Levitt walking around to Hall and Oates 'You make my dream' is AWESOME.The film shows the good and the bad of love, relationships, and life. It ends realistic . It's very funny and very sad at times movie . It's cute movie and great debut for Marc Webb. I recommend it for everyone, especially for people who don't necessary like romantic comedies (like me). I give it 8/10.",8,1,2,30 November 2013
X-Men," Less than stellar , but still nice
","'X-men' offers the viewer good special effects , nice action and decent story . The movie suffers from the fact that this is kinda origin story, yet there is too little time to explore the X-men universe . In comic books there is endless time to explore characters and introduce them to reader . Here we get to know only about the few of them – Xavier , Magneto , Wolverine and Rogue. Others like Cyclops or Jean Grey are barely introduced . Some are just instrumental characters like Sabertooth or Storm . The characters aren't too complex , because time doesn't allows for that . Yet , thanks to the actors their likable and memorable. With the exception of Halle Berry as Storm (she seems too young and not too charismatic ) the casting is top notch . Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen seem to be born to play Wolverine , Xavier and Magneto.There is nice love triangle here and good friendship/rivalry relationship between Wolverine/Cyclops/Jean Grey . Some things were changed here compared to the comic books. Still , the changes were good and logical (such as with the costumes). The special effects are unfortunately quite outdated by today standards. The whole movie feels like a TV episode - pilot for a TV series instead of epic science fiction action movie. The action is nice , but nothing really spectacular. It feels like Bryan Singer (famous for 'Usual suspects') doesn't feels confident with them. The story is rather thin and the whole movie really feels more like an introduction to the world of Xmen than anything else. Thankfully , in the sequel the action , story and special effects were improved.It's one of the first of new wave of comic book movies. It's not one of the best , but not one of the worst either. I give it 6/10.",6,0,1,11 August 2013
Zodiac," Searching for killer
","Searching for the killer is like searching for the meaning of live – hard job with uncertain resultsMany viewers complain about the length , but I think I understand what the writer and director were trying to accomplish . You see the search for Zodiac took years. The movie tries to capture that feeling of passing time and that's one of the reason for the movie being so long. The very detailed investigation is the most interesting aspect of the movie . It's hard not compare 'Zodiac' to 'Se7en' . The latter is obviously superior. In 'Se7en' you can feel the presence of killer everywhere and he both scary and mysterious. Here we know that he is somewhere out there and that he is killing people , but he isn't even half fascinating like John Doe. 'Se7en' also was happening in one town , which felt and looked ugly , was a character of it's own and had a very claustrophobic feel about it. Here the killer seems to be working in whole country , which makes the movie less scary. We have three heroes here – Jake Gyllenhal , Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo. The movie keeps switching from them and it's hard to connect emotionally for the viewer with one of them . It also doesn't help that Gyllenhal (who probably has the most screen time of them all) is very bland , a true boy scout indeed . Downey Jr. is better , but he gives another 'I'm a blasé jester' performance (which works for Iron man) . The best performance here comes from the underrated Ruffalo , who gives a subtle portrayal of mild mannered man tired of the constant chase.The movie has some thrilling moments , but it's more of a drama . It's a story about people who lived in the shadow of Zodiac, who by chasing him somehow gave a meaning to their life. 'Zodiac' doesn't end like a movie , it ends like a real life – nothing is resolved for sure. I see this as a tribute to the people who are trying hard to catch a criminal , protect the people , work in the shadows and rarely (if at all) have any reward from the faith or society. Is it worth it ? Why do it ? You have to look for the answers yourself.I give it 7/10.",7,0,0,31 December 2013
The Adventures of Tintin," Spielberg brings back his magic
","I've never read a Tintin comic book . I remember watching a cartoon about Tintin when I was younger and that I liked it . I was worried about this movie , because we all know how 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of crystal skull ' turned out to be Not to mention this is Spielberg's first movie done completely in 3D , if I'm not wrong . He never did animation before (he was a producer of a few animated movies), so I had my reservations .Thankfully , Spielberg does not disappoint with this one . All the magic and charm you expected in forth Indy movie appears here . I felt like a little kid again . Thank you , Mr. Spielberg . It's not that good as the original trilogy , but definitely more fun that 'IJATKOCS'.The animation is top notch . The pacing is very good – never too slow or too fast . The characters are obviously colorful and interesting . There is also plenty of humor and action . There is no blood , so it's a great movie for whole family. There is one great chase sequence . The dog is cute and the captain is very funny.Good job . I give it 8/10.",7,1,2,4 July 2013
The Expendables," Good old school action movie but with a room for improvemet
","'Expendables' earned much money thanks to the big names and nostalgia. This is not a movie that lives to the incredibly high expectations of action fans. I still would rather watch 'Commando' or 'Tango and Cash'. There are some flaws here that stop it from being great. Yet it's a good movie. Stallone is not a bad director , but here he doesn't always do good job. The movie drags at times , especially in the first half . 'Expendables' also feels too serious and too dark for it's own good. The moral dilemmas are very heavy handed . It feels like Stallone wanted to do his version of 'Seven samurai' at places. Yikes. Thankfully there is some great macho dialogues and jokes here . The action scenes themselves are well done.'Expendables' is a movie that truly lives only during action scenes. The action scenes are done in modern way with a lot of quick cut editing , CGI blood and explosions. I have to say I was hoping for more old school approach. The CGI looks horrible at places. The editing is sometimes too quick , but overall the action scenes are quite powerful. The mayhem at the end is something you just don't see in modern action movies.The plot is both simple and underdeveloped. The story was told before and is very overused by now. Stallone and Statham have the most screen time , while other characters struggle to find their place in the story. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis appear for 5 minutes and only talk. They don't take part in any of the action. What a waste ! Mickey Rourke seems like a pointless character . He makes one important , but terribly lame speech that made my head hurt. Thankfully Dolph Lundgren and Jet Li are entertaining as the crazy drug addict and always complaining karate fighter. The movie lacks good main villain. Eric Roberts or the general Mendoza don't seem really menacing or interesting. Brian Tyler provides an energetic soundtrack. There is plenty of one-liners and in jokes references. The movie is rated R and makes a good use of it - a massive body count, loads of bone crunching action, explosions, bad guys getting gruesome payback.Hollywood just doesn't make them like this anymore. I like the sequel slightly better , even if it wasn't perfect too. Thanks to Stallone and others for some good old school feven if it's not as good as it could be). I give it 6/10.",6,0,0,26 December 2014
Shutter Island," Botchered thriller by Scorsese
","I didn't read the book on which the movie is based. From what I've heard it's a great book . This movie is definitively not great . Anyway , the movie had advantage on me with the fact that I didn't knew anything about the story. The basic facts I knew sounded promising and despite that Scorsese in last years haven't been in good shape , I was still hoping for a good movie. It seems that not always you get what you wish for.The movie doesn't work for few reasons . First of all – Leonardo DiCaprio . I'm sorry , but he just doesn't fit for a guy with troubled past . He doesn't look manly enough . Also , he overacts too much . He shouts and makes a 'I have troubled past' face too often . His role required subtlety he just wasn't able to give . William Hurt would be perfect for this type of role.I don't know was it DiCaprio overacting or Scorsese clumsy direction , but I was able to guess THE BIG TWIST after 40 minutes of the movie . Even if you aren't too clever , you should figure out at least in the half of the movie. If you haven't figure it out till the movie reveals the twist to the audience , it's done in so lame way that my head hurt. The whole revelation feels like Scorsese is explaining the twist to someone retarded. It's annoying and done in terribly amateurish way.Scorsese directs the movie badly . If I didn't knew that Scorsese was directing this movie , I would thought that it was made by one of those MTV-generation directors , like Bret Rattner. The movie should be dark , scary and emotionally engaging . Yet it comes out as flat , cold and Hollywood type of dark stuff. From what I've heard from the readers of the book they were heartbroken with the ending . Here it comes out emotionally empty . The movie just seems to flow from one scene to another in a soulless way. I was watching it , not experiencing it like I should.Mark Ruffallo gives a nice performance here , just like Jackie Earle Haley and Max Von Sydow. Ben Kingsley seems to be bored . There is some fine art-direction . The music is annoying. In the end you can follow the second interpretation what really happened . Not that movie is worth re-watch.I give it 5/10.",5,2,5,19 August 2013
Ocean's Thirteen," Return to quality
","After the disappointing Oceans 12' this one is a pleasant surprise. The magic is back and it was once again fun to meet with Danny and his gang. It's not as good as the first movie of the series , but it's fun anyway.The story is simple – Danny and gang want to avenge Reuben who was hurt by evil Bank (Al Pacino in good form). Their plan is complicated and they will have to face many obstacles. Sometimes the story is illogical in few places and little predictable. It is however much better than the overloaded story in 'Ocean's 12'.If you enjoyed the first movie , you should enjoy this one too. The acting is very natural and the dialogues are witty . Quite a lot funny moments (Oprah !)The directing is top notch. Movie looks and sounds good. The old cast is back with the exception of ladies (Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta Jones).Good entertainment in old Hollywood style. I give it 6/10.",6,1,2,21 June 2014
Rocky II," Rematch of the century
","After the success of Rocky' Stallone tried to establish himself as a serious drama actor . Unfortunately , neither 'F.I.S.T.' (which I saw and I think is nice) or 'Paradise alley' came close to the success of Avildsen's movie. Stallone was kinda forced to return to Balboa , if he didn't want his career to end.It's hard to think something new in the movie about boxing . 'Rocky 2' certainly lacks the freshness of original and feels like a copy . Once again Rocky has trouble in everyday life , there is training montage (hell , TWO training montages) and epic fight at the end. The movie does gets too sappy at times . The movie doesn't have anything to add to characters audience already met.It doesn't mean that it's a bad movie . 'Rocky 2' feels very realistic in terms of story . Loosing hard earned money , failing into obscurity, becoming a sell out – those a serious real life problems that do feel important here. Stallone is director here and he handles some of the dramatic scenes really well ( for example Balboa talking with Mick about going back). The training scenes feel inspirational and the main fight is exciting. There are some good dialogues here and jokes (the talk in the church about condominium).'Rocky 2' doesn't comes close to the first movie. It isn't that well made and it's not that deep. It doesn't feel inspired . Still, it's a solid craftsmanship and a good sequel overall. I give it 7/10.",7,1,2,30 November 2013
Predator," The hunter becomes the prey
","Predator' is a classic action/science fiction movie and a worthy rival of Alien'. It's not as arty as Scott's movie , but it has other qualities. You could say it's a mix of 'Aliens' and 'Commando' . It's action movie , horror and science fiction in one. It's definitely one of the most popular Hollywood blockbusters in history. It could be very easily a dumb b-class action movie , but thankfully it was done by professionals and remains one of the best movies of 80's and best movies ever.The original concept for this film originated as a joke. Someone said after watching 'Rocky 4' that Stallone's next rival in 'Rocky 5' will be an alien , because the defeated all human opponents . The mandibles of the predator were the idea of James Cameron ('Terminator'). Interesting thing – Jean Claude Van Damme ('Bloodsport') was cast to play Predator , but he was quickly fired and replaced by Kevin Peter Hall – experienced actor who played many monsters in his movie career thanks to his impressive height.It's a true macho movie full of manly men and no love story in it. There is no substance here , just pure adrenaline. Who could forget great one liners such as 'I don't have time to bleed' or 'If it bleeds , then we can kill it' and . 'Your one ugly motherf****r' .The heavy artillery is also cool - ultra-destructive Gatling gun or Predator's blades and shoulder gun. Add to that a great jungle that gives a true claustrophobic feel to the movie. It's probably the best jungle in the history of cinema. Funny thing – the whole movie was made in studio.Most people remembers Arnold performance here with the classic and incredibly funny 'Get to da choppa' and 'Stick around' one-liners. The truth is this is one of Schwarzenegger best performances . His low-key performance works really well and he is definitely a man who could defeat an alien hunter. There is also great ensemble cast here that includes : Carl Weathers (Apollo Creed from 'Rocky' series) , Bill Duke ('Commando') , Sonny Landham ('48 hours') , Shane Black (writer of 'Lethal weapon' series) , Jesse Ventura (' The Running man') and the Predator itself – Kevin Peter Hall ( 'Harry and the Hendersons'). Watch out near the end of the movie – you will see Kevin Peter Hall without the costume (he plays a black helicopter pilot at the end of movie).Director John McTieran directs the movie with astonishing suspense and brilliant pacing , something he also shows in 'Die hard'. Alan Silvestri's legendary musical score also helps to keep the tension and makes sure that the audience are on the edge of their seats at all times. . The jungle as I've already mentioned is a very original and great setting for the movie.The Predator's unmasked face is a real accomplishment in make-up effects , just like the whole invisibility trick rightfully deserved the Oscar nomination for best visual effects. The Predator itself is a fascinating creature, scary and full of mystery. A worthy opponent of Alien indeed.The only bad thing is the fact that the movie never really explains what Predator was doing in the jungle and we didn't get to see Predator's ship . The ending also leaves much to be desired in terms of believability , but that's a minor issue.'Predator' is a simple movie with simple plot done in wonderful way. It holds very well on repeated viewings . It has likable heroes , great villain , catch dialogues , memorable scenes and overall it's a top notch entertainment. I give it 8/10.",8,1,2,23 February 2014
The Matrix Revolutions," The gibberish sequel number two
","*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERSRevolutions' . Why revolutions instead of revolution ? I think I know the answer . I agree with people who support the 'Matrix in matrix ' theory . That the real world itself is just another matrix , another form of control . It's the only way for the movie to make sense.Anyway , this long awaited sequel is a little better than 'Reloaded' . It has a little bit less of gibberish dialogue . The pacing also seems to be a little better . Special effects are great and almost all the action scenes are enjoyable (except the final fight between Neo and Smith). Unfortunately , 'Revolutions ' fail because of one simple reason – the conclusion of the whole trilogy is  no conclusion at all . The only message that this movie seems to have is a tribute to faith . Any kind of faith . Of believing in yourself and your beliefs no matter what. Faith . And the true heroism isn't about punching and winning , but about making sacrifices. It is reflected in the words and actions of not only Neo , but other heroes ( Niobe , Morpheus , The kid ). This actually would be good enough substance for many movies , but not for 'Revolutions' . We were promised that the third movie will be a Holy Grail , that it will show us the meaning of live or something like that  In the end after all that hype , millions of dollars and hysteria the ending message seems to simplistic . Was there a real reason to make the 'Matrix' sequels ? Did they had this conclusion prepared or they felt that they need to figure out something and they came with this ? You could do a great movie about faith and heroism without special effects , big budget and hype . The ending result seems like a disappointment. People are still trying to figure out about what the sequels were all about.'Revolutions ' also has other problems . EVERY character that dies here has a long pathetic speech . The love story between Neo and Trinity that was so important during the trilogy wasn't believable or convincing even for a moment . The movie just like 'Reloaded' suffers from too much style over substance , so in the end it feels very kitschy when Agent Smith and Neo are fighting like it was 'Dragonball Z'. There is also too much pathos and very little of real emotion. The movie doesn't add to much to the Matrix universe . It feels like they run out of ideas.Disappointment . In the end it feels like I've been cheated and the whole thing is just a shinning piece of s***. Maybe 'Reloaded' and 'Revolutions' are deep philosophical movies and I'm too stupid to understand them . In my defense I'm not the only one who felt I was watching a philosophy lesson by Michael Bay. I give it 2/10.",2,2,3,4 August 2013
Pitch Black," Vin Diesel versus aliens
","'Pitch black' isn't a cheap imitation of 'Alien' . Is it inspired by Ridley Scott movie ? Yes (look at the ship design and the creatures design). Does it try to build something new ? Yes. We have hero an sci-fi horror movie combined with survival drama. It isn't exactly original , but it's well done to give us enjoyable movie.The director David Twohy beautifully employs many different colors, shades and intensities of light which set the mood and lend a unique feeling to the film itself . The movie is well paced and has some 'wow' moments and a heart as well. It switches from drama to action to horror very naturally.The special effects are more than adequate, despite the fact that this movie didn't had a big budget.Along with Fast and furious' this is Vin Diesel's most known movie . A star is born ? Yes. Vin Diesel acts really well in the role as Riddick – an anti-hero bad-ass convict. He's got a magnetic presence. And Diesel doesn't trivialize the character, as could so easily be done, by giving him a 'heart of gold' .We also have other interesting characters with unique quirks and mannerisms such as Lewis Fitz Gerald antiques dealer , Imam (Keith David) the Muslim guy , pilot Fry (great Radha Mitchell ) , Johns the cop , Jack the boy . Every character is complex, three-dimensional, with conflicting traits so you never quite know who's good and who's bad.The relationships between the characters are interesting and the movie is a good sci-fi drama driven by the characters.A really solid , emotional , and not stupid piece of entertainment . I give it 7/10.",7,0,2,1 November 2013
Hugo," Nice family friendly entertainment and nothing more
","I like 'Hugo' . I like it much more than 'The Artist ' which for me is incredibly dull , boring , heartless and soulless movie. At least you can feel some heart in Scorsese movie. Still , I don't think 'Hugo' deserves such high rating. Coming from master of cinema this is just a decent movie.From technical point of view the movie deserved all the Oscar awards and nominees . 'Hugo' looks good , even if the CGI is too visible sometimes. You can find many more or less subtle references to old movies ( For example 'Safety last' – it's even on the movie poster) . The acting is good . Only Sacha Baron Cohen seems to be miscast . He is rather annoying instead of funny . Not to mention he can't give his character true depth that is required in the final of the movie.The biggest problem however is the screenplay. This movie is nothing by generic family friendly movie. It's not too deep. It's ABSOLUTELY predictable . There are no surprises or twists. It was hard for me as an adult to watch this movie , because every message is told loud and straight to the audience face ( The broken machines are like people who lost their dreams etc. etc. ). I think Scorsese made a movie for kids not adults. This is not necessarily a bad thing , but Scorsese lacks the sensibility of Steven Spielberg to direct this kind of movie. The movie didn't left me cold , I felt something , but I wasn't in tears or anything like that.For a movie about movie magic there isn't too much magic here. I give it 7/10.",7,0,1,26 May 2013
Warrior," Good movie , but seriously people
","Get this out of IMDb Top 250 , because it's rather embarrassing that this movie has such high rating . I like it and it's definitely quite well made movie . Still , I can't stop wondering why people love this movie so much . Is it because the new sport such as MMA is rather more popular now than boxing ? Maybe.Anyway , there isn't nothing here that you didn't see in one the 'Rocky' movies . With the exception of Hardy's mysterious past the movie is very straightforward and rather predictable from start to finish. The movie also failed to really explain what the conflict between brothers was all about. I understood the conflict between brothers and father . The movie takes it time to explain that to us and that's a good thing . Unfortunately , the whole explanation of conflict between brothers takes only few seconds and is rather unconvincing (at least for me). In the end it felt very rushed and it's a bad thing , because it was important part of the movie.'The Warrior' feels also strangely like a commercial for MMA . You don't have money ? Go to MMA. You want to repair your relationship with father ? Go to MMA. You want to forgive your brother ? Go to MMA. You want to relax after hard day in job ? Go to MMA.Thankfully , this is also a movie about winning self respect and achieving forgiveness . It's obviously directed with passion . Sometimes even with too much passion (the last 5 minutes of the movie full of pathos) . There is lot of energy during the fights . The mysterious past of Hardy is intriguing to the end of the movie . Nice dialogue . And definitely good acting.Nick Nolte is phenomenal in a heartbreaking role of ex-alcoholic father. He deserved the Oscar nominee . This must be the best performance of his career . Joel Edgerton is good as the mild mannered teacher fighting for his family . Tom Hardy is even better as the black sheep of family . There is lot of anger, mystery and tension in him. Jennifer Morrison is nice in her love of loving wife , even if she basically repeats her performance from 'House MD'.It's a good movie . Overrated , but good . I give it 7/10.",7,1,5,7 August 2013
Heartbreak Ridge," This is what I call a feel good movie !
","Eastwood rarely disappoints . This one is pure fun 80's style . It wouldn't have been made today – it's too politically incorrect . People are swearing , there is no 'America is bad , war is bad 'message , the soldiers are portrayed as human beings not mindless killing machines. The movie sends a 'win with yourself' message without being sappy . Actually it's one of the funniest movies I have seen. A great war comedy. There are many one liners and situations that are worth mentioning , but I just don't have time to write them all. My favorite is the joke with the waitress at the beginning of the movie and the t-shirts. There is some action in the last 30 minutes of the movie.It's fun to see how Eastwood's character interacts with his recruits and other people . Clint really fits the role of old fashioned soldier . It's good to see a REAL man in the leading role – something which is so rare in today movies. I also have to mention Mario Van Peebles as the adorable hippie rock singer Stitch. It's strange he didn't made a big career . He's charming and talented. Marsha Mason is lovely as Aggie.The movie is lighthearted fun , yet it wants the audience to respect the veterans , because nobody who wasn't at war can't really understand them . They are too often unappreciated and subject of jokes and attacks from society . No , this is not a pro-military movie . Even if it is considering how many anti-army and anti-war movies were made this one is a refreshing change . It's unpretentious fun , people , just like 'Top gun' . It was made mostly to make the Americans feel better , but the amount of USA patriotism here is small , so everyone can enjoy it . Don't look for meaning of live and enjoy it .I give it 7/10.",7,1,2,1 November 2013
Rocky IV," Incredibly entertaining silly fun
","The plot of Rocky IV' is very simple. It's basically the same plot as in 'Rocky 3' with small changes (Apollo instead of Mick , Ivan Drago instead of Clubber Lang). Unlike other movies in the series 'Rocky IV' isn't a sport drama – it's too silly for that , too cheesy to take itself seriously. It's more of an unusual action movie with boxing in it. It's more like 'Commando' than original 'Rocky' . If you're ready to accept it , prepare yourself for fun. The movie was a huge success – 'Rocky IV' was the highest grossing film in the Rocky series, taking some $300 million worldwide. After watching the movie it's not strange to see why. It's a product of it's times , but still very entertaining today.Yes , the Russians are portrayed stereotypical here and in reality, Soviet Heavyweights were not allowed to box professional fighters during the Cold War , but who really cares (except for Russians of course). 'Rocky IV' is largely a metaphor for the tensions between America and Russia which existed in the Cold War. Drago is Soviet Union – stronger and cruel , while Balboa is America – weaker, but with more heart and stamina. The famous line 'it's better to watch two people trying to kill each other than twenty millions' actually has meaning here. Communist and Nazis did use the sports for their propaganda and very often in real life politics and sport were entwined. 'Rocky IV' has a strong anti-communist message, which I appreciate unlike other viewers. Communism was a terrifying system that treated people like puppets for the needs of communist party (Drago here is no exception). 'Rocky IV' also has got a simple , but honest (at least to me ) message that people should look past their political beliefs and try to find peace on Earth. There is also some interesting commentary here on man vs machine and dehumanization of society because of technology (Paulie's robot).The movie is far from being realistic , but I have to defend it a little. First of all it IS possible for a boxer to die during boxing match ( Benny Paret vs Emile Griffith in 1962) . Second , it is possible for a crowd to cheer for the opponent when he wins their respect ( in football/soccer when a player of the opposite team shoot 4 goals in one match the crowd gave him a standing ovation). Third , Rocky's unconventional techniques have a logic behind them. Rocky isn't using technology or steroids , because he doesn't think that's honorable . He makes it harder for himself intentionally and he succeeds . It's not the technology and money , but heart and talent what really count. The training sequences are top notch , great to watch and inspiring. The training techniques and technology that Drago has in this movie were considered science fiction in 1985 , but now they are a standard . And it's true that in communist countries steroids were often used.Stallone was in great physical shape in 1985 as he made both 'Rambo 2' and 'Rocky 4'. That's all you remember from his performance . Talia Shire , Carl Weathers and Burt Young gave good performances as their repeated their roles from previous movies. Brigitte Nielsen (Stallone's future wife) is OK as the wife of Drago. The real star here is however Dolph Lundgren ('The Punisher') as Ivan Drago. He was a perfect choice. His physically incredibly intimidating and definitely one of greatest cinema villains.This is the only Rocky film where the music is not composed by Bill Conti. James Brown 'Living in America' , Robert Trepper 'No easy way out' ( one of the best montage songs ever ) , Survivor ' Burning heart' , John Cafferty 'Hearts on fire' – the soundtrack here is just fantastic. Stallone's makes a great use of the songs and Vince DiCola's music ('Training montage' is incredibly catchy) . He shows a talent worthy of great music video director here. When the music appears it's incredibly inspiring and powerful. The fights scenes are appropriately brutal and unrealistic , but that's what they are so fun. It's an ultimate David versus Goliat fight.The movie is full of memorable , if not silly dialogues and one liners. Who could forget 'If I can change , then you can change then everybody can change' . Other famous lines : 'If he dies, he dies' , 'Hit the one in the middle' , 'I will break you'. The 'hit the one in the middle' exchange, actually did happen in real life fight during the Max Baer-Max Schmeling heavyweight fight in June 1933 .It's definitely a classic movie and a symbol of the 80's – over the top , but wonderfully entertaining. If I had to rate it for it's pure entertainment value I would give it 10/10. However since this is an odd entry in a solid series of sport dramas I give it 6/10.",6,3,7,23 February 2014
The Usual Suspects," Who is Keyser Soze ?
","The title comes from a line in the classic film 'Casablanca' (1942), where the corrupt police chief, anxious to cover up the murder of a Nazi officer, tells a subordinate to 'round up the usual suspects,' meaning that the police should find a bunch of random criminals to be questioned. In the film, the usual suspects are five small-time crooks who are brought together in a police line-up on trumped-up charges. Funny thing - the idea for this movie started only with the concept of a movie poster of five of guys in a lineup.'The Usual suspects ' is a modestly-budgeted piece . All the actors worked for less than their usual fees. It shows you their dedication to the project and seems impossible to make this film today , when almost every movie has a 200 mln budget. This movie doesn't have budget , but it has the thing that is really the most important in a movie – screenplay.The ending is one of the most memorable scenes in movie history . It's very simple and very effective . Simply unforgettable , when the truth hits you like a ton of bricks. The quote from the French poet Charles Baudelaire 'The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he did not exist' appears in this movie and it's definitely one of the most famous lines in movie history.The story seems convoluted , but in the end makes perfect sense. It grabs you from the start with the mystery of what happened in the docks. There are more mysteries and twists along the way until the very end. Like every good criminal this movie does lose it's magic on repeated viewings , yet not quite. On repeated viewings you can see many clues you might have missed . You will also notice how well written the dialogues are.Kevin Spacey gives quite possibly the best performance of his career as fast-talking yet shy con artist crippled by cerebral palsy. He deserved Oscar . The rest of the cast shines too - Gabriel Byrne , Benicio Del Toro , Kevin Pollak , Chazz Palmintieri and even Stephen Baldwin. The music by John Ottman is underrated . It's very elegant and moody score. Bryan Singer directs with confidence and energy , never allowing the plot to be confusing.The only bad thing I can say about this movie that it's only a game . There's nothing , no message , no substance underneath this brilliant construction. It's just a pure entertainment and intelligent fun with the viewer , but who said that's a bad thing ? I give it 9/10.",9,1,1,31 December 2013
Die Hard 2," What's the problem ? It's a great sequel
","*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS I don't understand the complains about 'Die hard 2 : Die harder' . The first movie was almost a perfect action movie . It was obvious that sequel will be weaker , yet 'Die hard 2' is a very satisfying sequel . It follows the formula that worked so well the first time : one hero - one place - many terrorists , wife in danger , nobody listens to him except a black guy and everything happens during Christmas . There is not a bit of new idea here . The only change is the new director – Renny Harlin , who took over John McTiernan (who was busy with 'The hunt for Red October') . Harlin is a solid craftsman and he directs the movie professionally. The screenplay was once again written by Steven Souza and with a help from Doug Richardson.I'm amazed by the complains about the violence and swearing . Look people , this is R rated movie . If you can't stand the heat , stay out of kitchen. Maybe people who are obsessed with political correctness forgot about it , but in REAL LIFE people swear . A lot. And there isn't a single scene of unnecessary violence here . When you're fighting for life you don't exactly have time for subtlety. If you're looking for mindless violence watch one of those stupid 'Saw' movies. And for god's sake there is no plot hole with the planes . You want to know why the airplanes didn't tried to land on other airports ? Because they had too little fuel and the weather was too bad. So , they had to stay in the air.What I liked ? Bruce Willis is back as the wise cracking John McClane . So is Bonnie Bedelia as his wife. Reginald Veljohnson appears in a small episode as Al Powell. There are one dimensional , but fun characters : John Amos as the idiotic chef of airport security Carmine Lorenzo and Tom Bover as Marvin the wacky janitor. Souza has a sense of humor and there is a plenty of moments to laugh . The action scenes directed by Harlin are exciting and fun. The screenplay offers also some nice twists.What I didn't liked ? I could live without the naked tai chi . There is one scene with the grenades that makes my head hurt. Those have to be the slowest grenades in the movie history. I don't understand why the airport crew cooperated with the terrorists , even after the terrorists lost their equipment and couldn't blackmail the airport anymore. Also , the movie lacks a really good main villain compared to Alan Rickman from 'Die hard' or Jeremy Irons from 'Die hard 3'.Anyway , it's a good continuation of McClane's story . There is nothing new here , but it's well executed. In the end it's one of those rare satisfying sequels. I give it 8/10.",8,2,2,26 August 2013
District 9," Quite good , despite bad writing
","The best thing about 'District 9' are obviously the special effects. They are VERY impressive and help you forget that your just watching a movie. The idea for this movie isn't exactly new ('Alien nation' from the 80's was first) , but still makes for an interesting and quite original movie . The action scenes are done well and entertaining. The acting is decent.The movie is obvious allegory for apartheid /racism. We see peoples lack of empathy , ignorance and sometimes pure cruelty (the scene with burning house with alien eggs). It's even quite frightening to see black people being hostile towards aliens. The vision of humanity's reaction to aliens is pessimistic , but unfortunately realistic one. This is no 'Independence day' or 'Close encounters of third kind'. The movie works best when it concentrates on human's nature. It's too bad that 'District 9' very quickly concentrates on special effects and action. It too easily becomes another 'innocent man on the run' movie , only with aliens. More depth , less action please.The screenplay is rather mediocre. The story is really simple and after 5 minutes you can easily guess what will happen and who will be important. The characters are terribly thin . The main hero is one-dimensional unlikable asshole . His change of heart isn't one bit convincing. We have also awfully cliché characters like evil father in law , evil soldier/mercenary (who is strong and stupid) or evil gang lord. Even the main alien characters are lame – kid alien is basically a sweet child , while the big alien is 100% boy scout.What is worse there is some stupidity here . The main hero doesn't seem to understand what 'hiding in plain sight' means and is acting VERY irresponsible . Anybody with half of brain wouldn't make the same stupid mistakes he did. There is also one quite big plot hole involving entering the city.'District 9' is quite good movie , but overrated. The idea begs for something more complicated than simple action movie. It begs for something like 'Blade runner' or 'Brazil'. The authors of this movie had good idea , but in my opinion they wasted it a little bit. It's a good movie , but could have been a LOT better. I give it 7/10.",7,2,2,26 August 2014
Days of Thunder," Shameless copy of 'Top gun'
","Tony Scott directs this movie with energy . The movie looks good. The song 'Show me heaven' by Maria McKee is great . There romance here works better than in 'Top gun' , mostly because Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman become a couple during filming and soon married each other. The acting is fairly decent.However I've already have seen this movie back in 1986. It was called 'Top gun'. I think it's offensive if somebody tries to sell you THE SAME STORY all over again only with minor changes. I like 'Top gun' because of it's cheesiness and nostalgia. It's a minor classic that it's enjoyable when not taken seriously.This is not a horrible movie , it has good elements , but I don't really see what was the point of making it other than to grab audience money without putting too much effort. for that I give it 2/10.",2,2,5,16 February 2016
The Pianist," Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
","*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERSWhy this movie was made ? What's so interesting in Szpilman's story ? Nothing . I really mean nothing . They could make this movie with original character and it wouldn't change a thing . What's the point of the movie ? What's this movie is all about ? This is a story of one guy who survived war . That's it. The main hero is hardly a hero in any sense of that world . He's hardly a character. He's more like an object . Instrument that goes from one hands to another hands . This must be the most inactive hero in the history of the cinema . There isn't a single moment when he did something for others ( his family doesn't count). He's got no personality at all . The Oscar for Adrien Brody is a scandal . FOR WHAT ?! For one sad face through whole movie ?! He did convince me that he's a pianist . There's one good scene here when Szpilman 'plays' on piano. It doesn't change the fact that ANYONE could play what Brody plays here . Even a guy from street like me. One of the most undeserved Oscars ever. The nomination for Oscar would be too much for his 'performance'.'The Pianist' wastes time to show us scenes of Nazi's killing Jews and destroying Warsaw . I'm sorry , but it takes much more to touch my heart than showing simply bad people doing bad things to good people . Also , since our hero is an empty character , then why should I care if he's struggling to survive ? I didn't care for him for a moment. In the end the entire movie seems pointless and empty.There is a great Russian movie ' Sudba cheloveka' from 1959 . It tells a story about a guy that lost everything during a war. Yet , he never give up . He kept helping other people when he could , even if it could cost him his life . It's a hunting movie about man that survived psychically and emotionally a nightmare of war . It's touching and strangely uplifting . Watch it and then watch Polanski's 'masterpiece' and you should notice how empty and lacking heart 'The Pianist' really is. One more thing . Some people in Warsaw were against Szpilman , some were neutral , some helped him . It's sad that in the end the movie seems to tell us that a German officer was the person responsible for Szpilman's survival. Really ?! Another 'Good Nazi ' cliché in Hollywood movie ?! In the ending credits there is only note about what happened to that German officer after the war. There is no information about the Polish people who helped Szpilman . Why ? If there is no information about their post war life , the movie should inform us about it. In the end it seems that Szpilman didn't give a f*** about people who saved him . Talk about disrespect. The German officer didn't risk anything at all . The war was already over . The Polish people who helped Szpilman risked their lives and lives of their families. They should be mentioned here.We shouldn't make movies about people like Szpilman . It's not a bad thing that he wanted to survive. Everybody wants to life . Still , there is no lesson for us – the audience from Szpilman's story. We should make movies about Irena Sendlerowa – true humans , true heroes.I give 'The Pianist' 2/10 , because of beautiful music (Chopin).",2,7,19,11 August 2013
X-Men: The Last Stand," Chaos instead of epic conclusion
","It was a double tragedy that Bryan Singer decided to leave X-men franchise to direct Superman returns' and left it in the hands of Brett Ratner . 'Superman returns' sucked badly, while Ratner murdered X-men . There is strong possibility that if Singer directed the third part of X-men it would be at least decent.The story is all over the place. There are 5 or 6 story lines from the comics collapsed into this movie, none of them working at all. Like 2 or 3 movies were made and just cut together. The characters either disappear (Nightcrawler) or appear (Juggernaut , Multiple man) without any explanation . New mutants are introduced without developing their character or even their motivation one bit. Important characters get killed very quickly without any emotional impact on the viewer . Other like Angel are simply pointless. Jean Grey is badly developed and so is Magneto.The cast seem to be unmotivated . Only Kelsey Grammar as The Beast and Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut shine. The action is not bad and so are the special effects. The movie is definitely not boring.The first movie wasn't bad , the second was great and this is simply bad sequel . Not necessarily the worst comic book movie ever , but what a wasted possibility for heart wrenching epic finale... I give it 2/10.",2,1,2,19 August 2013
The Mist," Nice , but fails half the way
","*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS It's third movie by Frank Darabont based on Stephen King book (The other are 'The Shawshank redemption' and 'The Green mile'). It's the weakest of the three , but not necessarily because the book is not as great . No . The book itself was solid and it should been a solid movie. The problem is mainly with the adaptation.Let's start with the good things . The movie works really well when it concentrates on the people in the shop. You could cut the tension with the knife. Also the first two meetings with the monsters are really scary. The overall acting is good. The big beast at the end is REALLY IMPRESSIVE.OK , now the bad things. Thomas Jane is a weak actor and gives a poor performance. The CGI is very outdated . It looks incredibly bad , like from some cheap computer graphic program. I find it rather unbelievable that old religious fanatic who everybody treats as crazy woman takes over control in the shop so easily. And what's with Stephen King and his anti-Christian sentiments he likes to put in his books ? The movie also struggles to say some message . It wants to be anti-war , anti-religious , anti-capitalism all at once. In the end it's all muddled and unconvincing.Darabont makes mistake by trying to scare the audience too hard. For example in the book the fact that the rope broke was scary enough. Here we also see blood and even a piece of body on the end of rope. In the later half of movie this over the top method of scaring audience becomes really annoying and kills all the thrills. It kinda turns the movie into a parody of itself.The nail to the coffin is the ending. It was supposed to be terrifying and heartbreaking . It ends predictable , unintentionally laughable and stupid. How does that woman survived , when everyone else who left the shop was attacked and killed ? How is it possible that they didn't heard or saw the army tanks and trucks ? How the army was able to get there ? Shouldn't the beasts kill them ? Overall , it's not a bad movie , but it could have been so much better. I give it 5/10.",5,0,3,10 September 2013
The Bourne Legacy," A shadow of the original trilogy
","'Bourne legacy ' is a movie set in the Bourne universe with a new character as the main hero. Tony Gilroy is both the director and writer this time . He was also the writer of original trilogy , so you can say that the franchise was left in the hands of family . The movie is a different story compared to the one you can find in the book of the same name (which wasn't written by Ludlum , by the way).The story here isn't really interesting . It's very linear and there aren't any twists or surprises . However , the biggest problem is the direction by Gilroy . It lacks energy and the pacing is clumsy . Gilroy tries to imitate the style of earlier movies , but his action scenes are terribly lacking excitement . I've never been a huge fan of the quick-cut fights in Bourne trilogy . Still, Liman and Greengrass made them enjoyable . Here they are so badly done I could barely see a thing before they were over. Even the car chase lacks speed . Ironically the best scene of the movie is the shout out in the laboratory , when our hero doesn't appear yet. There is some real tension and emotions that you won't find in the rest of the movie.Good performances by Rachel Weisz and Jeremy Renner . The love story between them is done really well and in a convincing way . Edward Norton is a disappointment – he isn't bad , it's just the fact his role could be played by anybody and the effect would be the same . So why bring good actor for a minor role ? I was also good to see old faces once more and listen to Moby's song.Compared to previous three movies this one is a obvious disappointment. I give it 4/10.",4,1,5,4 July 2013
Event Horizon," Nice copy of Alien'
","This is the best movie of Paul WS Anderson – the guy responsible for such classics as Mortal Kombat ' , 'Alien versus Predator' and few other stinkers . It's obviously inspired by 'Alien' with a little bit of 'Hellraiser' and 'Solaris' . It's a really nice movie that makes you wonder what happened with Anderson later . Why he became a creator of such crap movies ? Good performances by Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill. All the crew members are recognizable and likable . There is a traditional black guy-who-is –comic-relief and you know what ? He's actually funny. The art-direction is beautiful in some places (the chamber). I really liked one camera angle when the camera spins around – it looked really cool. The special effects hold up good after all those years.The movie scares quite nicely the audience with some disturbing images that won't leave or head for some time. It's a fun sci-fi horror movie that doesn't add anything new to the genre , yet provides a solid entertainment.I give it 6/10.",6,0,2,1 November 2013
Caddyshack," Classic , but I like more sophisticated movies
","When I think of 80's comedies I usually think about movies like ' Police academy' , 'Trading places' , 'Back to school ' , ' National lampoons vacation' , 'Beverly Hills cop' or 'Ghostbusters' . Somehow I didn't got to see 'Caddyshack' until last year. This movie has been called on of the greatest comedy movies of 80's and beyond. To be honest I think the movie is a little bit overrated ( probably because of the cult status it has). I didn't enjoyed it as much as I expected . I would rather watch one more time one of the movies I've mentioned above.It doesn't mean I don't like the movie at all. The problem for me is that a lot of the jokes fall flat. There is plenty of 'low' humor , over-the-top humor and at times also quite vulgar humor. I think I like a little bit more sophisticated humor. On the other hand I like the fact that this movie is not politically correct . I laughed hard at some of the jokes that will be probably offensive to other people ( For example – Rodney Dangerfield tells his Asian friend ' This is a rather exclusive club , so don't tell anyone that you're a Jew' ) . The parody of 'Jaws ' is priceless. Gunga Allunga. Overall , I had good time , but it's not necessarily my type of comedy.There is also a little problem with the screenplay. Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe) is supposed to be the main hero of the movie , yet he ends as a supporting character. He isn't even on the movie poster ! There is a love story between him and Maggie (Sarah Holcomb) that I've found rather boring and unnecessary . One could wonder wouldn't it be better for the movie to get rid of his character . Most of the jokes are otherwise provided by the so-called supporting characters that obviously and easily steal the whole show. I like the fact that the movie feels improvised , but the writers should make the story a little bit more focused.Acting is definitively a strong side of 'Caddyshack' . Chevy Chase , Bill Murray , Rodney Dangerfield and Ted Knight – each one of these actors fits his role PERFECTLY. All those characters are very charismatic and memorable. Chase plays Ty Webb - a rich and lazy guy with a Zen philosophy of life. Dangerfield plays Al Czervik – obnoxious , rich businessman from Czech Republic who's got no taste whatsoever. Murray plays Carl Spackler – retarded gardener who's trying to kill pesky ( but cute) gopher . Oh , by the way the obviously mechanic gopher was created by George Lucas. Last but not least Knight plays Judge Smails – hysterical and arrogant owner of the golf club. Other actors also give fine performances. It was also good to see Cindy Morgan (Lacey Underall) naked.The soundtrack is great . Kenny Loggins songs are catchy , especially the main song – ' I'm alright ' . Other artists are : Eddie Cochran 'Summertime blues' ,Earth Wind and Fire' Boogie Wonderland' , Hilly Michaels 'Something on your mind' , Journey 'Any way you want it ', The Paul Collins Beat 'There she goes' , Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky 'Waltz of the Flowers - Nutcracker Ballet' and Bill Murray (!)'Ballad of the Green Berets'. All those songs are great as well. The original music made by Johnny Mandel is very jazzy and nice. The musical scenes are beautifully choreographed and the music is excellent.This movie is better than any movie mad by Adam Sandler or Farrelly brothers , but I like other 80's comedies better. Still , if you like this type of humor you will probably enjoy yourself. I give it 8/10.",8,0,1,26 May 2013
Ip Man," Great martial arts movie
","I'm not necessary a fan of kung fu movies . There is something about them that turns me off. So , I had my reservations about watching this movie. I'm happy that I was wrong. I had a good time . Fans of kung fu movies probably will be in heaven . Yet I recommend this movie to everyone who don't likes kung fu movies – give it a try . You might be pleasantly surprised.'Ip man' is based on real life story , yet I don't know how much of what I've seen is a product of imagination and how much of truth is here. In the end it doesn't really matter. I was afraid that 'Ip man' will have a strong Chinese propaganda in it . Thankfully the movie is told in a universal way , so every viewer from around the world will be able to relate to the story.The fights look fantastic. The music is very epic at times . The acting is good. 'Ip man' is an interesting mix of kung fu movie and war drama. There are good portions of humor and they are well placed ( the fight in the house) . The drama is also affecting . The main hero is mild mannered man , who uses violence only when necessary . He's a very sympathetic character.'Ip man' is not necessarily my cup of tea , but it's a good movie. Watch it – you won't regret it. After all this is a movie about a guy who was mentor of Bruce Lee. I give it 8/10.",7,0,0,10 September 2013
Victory," The best movie about football/soccer ?
","To enjoy 'Victory' or 'Escape to victory' (as it was called in some countries) you should watch it as a lighthearted war comedy. As a serious drama this movie fails . 'Victory' is actually based on real story (see the IMDb trivia for this movie) . The authors of this movie originally wanted to make it a serious drama and a sad movie . To be honest I would love to see the serious version of this story . In the end they decided to make the light version . Maybe they felt the 80's were coming ? If this was made in the 70's it would be as serious movie. Every dramatic conflict that appears here is emotionally flat and the whole movie just shouldn't be treated as a serious one.Anyway , I like what we got here . The movie feels like a mix between 'Rocky' and 'The great escape ' . It gives the whole picture a sense of freshness . It's also probably the best movie with/about football/soccer (depends from where you are from) I've seen.The characters here are rather empty . Michael Caine , Sylvester Stallone and Max von Sydow are the only actors who have got something to play for . They made their one dimensional characters enjoyable. Caine is a smart leader , Stallone is a wise guy and von Sydow is a gentleman. Other characters are truly instrumental . The football/soccer fans will be delighted to see many legends as the prisoners , including Pele and Bobby Moore . I'm proud that Poland here is represented by Kazimierz Deyna.Bill Conti gives the movie very fun and uplifting music score . The football match itself feels very natural . It's well photographed, realistic and emotional . It has something that other football movies failed to capture – the beauty of this sport. The last fifteen minutes of the match is indeed done in real life time.There are two really great movie scenes here – one with the radio and the second with von Sydow standing up. Yes , in the end the movie becomes a little kitschy , still it works a sort of fairytale to make you feel better. It has certain charm and is quite well directed by famous director John Huston ('Maltanese falcon').If you're in a mood for some lighthearted entertainment and you like football or Stallone (or both ) this is not a bad way to spend your time. I give it 5/10.",5,2,2,4 August 2013
The Artist," Heartless , soulless , dull and boring  Disappointment
","I love movies of Charlie Chaplin , Buster Keaton , Harold Lloyd . I love 'Metropolis' , 'Pandora Box' , 'Gabinet of doctor Caligari ' and so on I'm not saying that I'm an expert in silent era movies , but I 've seen enough of them to recognize a good one.'The Artist' is first silent movie made in many years. It was supposed to be a great tribute to silent era and something more sophisticated than most of modern movies. Unfortunately , in my opinion this is only a gimmick . This is a trick . A movie aimed to win Oscars without any real importance or artistic quality.From technical point of view the movie deserves his awards – it looks like it was made back in 1920's . The cinematography , the art direction, costumes , film editing - they all are top notch. There are two great scenes involving sound (one in the middle of the movie , one at the end) . The music is good too , not great , but good. The acting is decent and that's it . I don't see anything special in performances of Bérénice Bejo and Jean Dujardin . Oh , and the dog is lovely.The biggest problem is with the screenplay and direction. The movie pretends that it says something important about cinema and actors , but good old 'Singing in the rain' did it MUCH BETTER. Also the movie is completely soulless and heartless . The movies of silent era maybe weren't complex , but they certainly had heart and soul . They had a childlike sensibility that could make you laugh and cry. 'The Artist' by comparison feels like a plastic. It has no charm , no humor (maybe with the exception of dog – he gave the best performance in the whole movie) . The story feels lifeless . It moves slowly , too slowly and quickly becomes boring . The directing is so awful you could wonder if anyone was directing this movie at all. Emotions ? None . Substance ? None.I don't think that Michel Hazanavicius REALLY UNDERSTOOD what those old movies were about . 'The Artist' feels like a cheap trick to impress the audience. Better watch one of those movies I've mentioned in the beginning of this review or any other TRUE silent era movie . Not some empty copy. This is movie about nothing . This movie is nothing.I give it 3/10.",2,2,5,15 June 2013
Where Eagles Dare," Epic action/war movie
","Good old Alistair MacLean . I love his books and the movies based on his books are often great too. 'Where Eagles dare' along with 'The Guns of Navarro' is the best movie based on his book. It's a simple story about a group of British and one American commandos trying to save American general from the hands of Nazis. The general has important information that can change the fate of whole World War II. His kept in a heavily guarded castle. Of course the story gets complicated I like that 'WED' feels like a real life instead of typical Hollywood action movie . There are no one-liners , love stories or too much humor ( Ironically, all those elements appears in MacLean book). There story takes itself seriously , but not too seriously. The movie is based on three characters played by Richard Burton , Clint Eastwood and Mary Ure. The others are more or less a fillers. In the end it doesn't real matters , since the plot is interesting and action engaging.Richard Burton Quito possibly gives the best performance of his life here. He TOTALLY dominates the screen . He's so tough, charming , bad ass that he makes look Eastwood bland . Can you imagine that ? Eastwood is reduced to a supporting player and nobody can't really complain about that . I've never thought I see a movie with Eastwood not being the ultimate bad ass on screen , but here it is ! It doesn't mean that Clint is bad here . He's good as a supporting character and he does get some cool action sequences here too . The movie just doesn't allow him to be as bad ass as in his later movies , but considering how awesome Burton is in this movie I doubt anyone can't complain. Mary Ure is nice as the woman spy.The movie is long (almost 3 hours) , yet never dull . The movie moves slowly and I can admit that most fun appears after first hour . 'WED' takes necessary time to set the story and since there is quite a lot plot here the viewer shouldn't be bored pay . From that moment the plot twists and action will amaze the viewer to the end of the movie. The last 45 minutes is non-stop action full of shootouts , fights and chases . The director Brian G. Hutton turns that part of the movie into exciting marathon of violence. What he does here for action movie is what Hitchcock did for thrillers . It's a spectacle , but not in mindless way. 'WED' is a believable action movie where a group of few people defeats the whole army. The modern action movie directors should take notes how to create great action without tons of money , CGI and quick montage. 'WED' is a proof that less is more – the scene with Burton fighting for life with two bad guys is better than all those kung fu fights combined together.I really like the art-direction here – the castle , the village , the camps. The movie is quite nicely photographed by Arthur Ibbefson and the music by Ron Goodwin is subtle , yet very effective . The special effects hold up pretty good considering their age. Unlike most action movies I regret that I haven't seen this one in cinema.A truly satisfying experience for all action movie fans and not only . I give it 8/10.",8,2,4,7 December 2013
National Treasure," Wait , THIS was a hit ?!
","*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS To be honest I don't know why 'National Treasure' was a hit . On other side , I don't know why people are still complaining about the quality of Michael Bay movies , yet his movies keep making money. Somebody has to watch them  Maybe I'm too harsh for 'National treasure ' . Compared to 'Transformers' series , this is actually a decent popcorn flick for one night. I guess people missed a good adventure movie since 'Indiana Jones and the last crusade'. 'NT' is better than Spielberg 'Indiana Jones and the kingdom of crystal skull' , so let's start with the good things about this movie.Diane Kruger is cute in this movie . Justin Barthe is great as a comic relief . The humor is probably the biggest strength of this movie . It's really funny and well placed . Jon Voight and Sean Bean give nice performances . Also , the art – direction is good.The bad things ? Nicolas Cage . A hero of adventure movie should be charismatic and likable. Harrison Ford in 'Indiana Jones ' movies ? Yes . Michael Douglas in 'Romancing the stone' ? Yes. Nicolas Cage here ? No. Just NO. He is boring and lifeless . He seems stiff and nervous through all the movie . A big miscast . I was also disappointed with Harvey Keitel who seems like 'I just came for few minutes and when I'm done just give me the money as quick as it's possible'.The action scenes are TERRIBLY LAME . The music is uninspired . I was able to guess some of the riddles before our heroes and I'm not even American . The plot is kinda predictable in few places and there aren't too many surprises here. Not to mention that the riddles seem to throw our heroes from one place to another just to keep the movie going. The characters also act illogical – The FBI should be at Voight house almost immediately after they identified Cage . It's a standard procedure , people ! Also , the villains at one point allow our heroes to escape , despite the fact that they need them . Near the end of the movie they also fall for an obvious lie. The movie also should end 15 minutes sooner. It was annoying in the end.Overall , you could skip this movie and watch something else , but if you want to watch it , it's not that bad. I give it 4/10.",4,0,3,11 August 2013
Rocky III," Good third movie
","I think Sylvester Stallone should end the story of Rocky here . It would be a fitting end for the most famous boxer in history of cinema. I like forth one , but as a entertainment movie . 'Rocky 5' was a misstep and it's good that 'Rocky Balboa' ended the franchise with style. Still , I think that three Rocky movies were more than enough. Oh well , I can't do anything about it.'Rocky 3' works really well as a third act of Balboa's story . It's not just another movie in the franchise . For me , it brings the story to full circle. In first movie we are introduced to Rocky, a boxer that has to fight both in the ring and in life for everything . He doesn't even dream of fame , yet he gets a chance from destiny to change his life . In second movie he changes . He wants fame and money . He loses himself . Thankfully he is able to realize that and comes back to his old self. 'Rocky 3 ' is a story about a man who lost his touch . He's the same likable , honest , good guy we met . Yet he's different. He lost his passion , his hunger , his magic (for lack of better word). He's burnt out . This is something many of us can relate to . We don't know what is the reason that our beloved director has stopped making good movies or why our favorite band can't record album as good as before . Nobody knows . It's hard to achieve success , but it's even harder to life with that success . To not fail . To not become a shadow of himself. 'R3' is a story about how hard is to come back to the top . It's kind of a prophecy for Stallone who disappeared somewhere in the mid 90's and came back triumphant in 2006 with Rocky Balboa. It's also a story about defeating your own fear .Mr.T who plays Clubber Lang represents a new generation of boxers – young , violent , aggressive , with no respect for anybody and anything. In a way he's a darker version of Balboa. T gives a good performance . He's different than Creed and memorable , so Stallone did good job with finding a worthy opponent for Balboa.Sylvester Stallone , Burgess Meredith , Burt Young , Talia Shire and Carl Weathers bring back the good acting they shown us before. Watch out for Chino 'Fats' Williams in small episode of drunk homeless man and for Hulk Hogan (sic !) as wrestler Thunderlips . 'Rocky 3' works as a solid sport drama . I could live without the boxing match between Stallone and Hogan . It belongs more to 'Rocky 4' and doesn't fit in to overall serious tone of the movie . The fights are exciting and quite realistic, especially compared to 'Rocky 4' (it's still a movie, so you need some suspension of disbelief) . The direction is solid . The training montage is inspirational and don't forget about great song 'Eye of the tiger' by Survivor (it was nominated for Oscar).I give it 7/10.",6,2,3,21 July 2013
The Untouchables," This movie needs and deserves more respect
","It's sad that such a great movie is ranked near the end of the IMDb Top 250 list and struggles to stay in it (not that IMDb Top 250 makes sense anyway) . I don't think people realize what a small piece of art this movie is and treat it as mere entertainment . Also, when talking about the best 80's movies people often forget about this pearl . Life's unfair.'The Untouchables ' is a gangster movie , yet you shouldn't compare it to 'Godfather' , 'Godfather 2' , 'Once upon a time in America' or 'Goodfellas'. The reason is simple – it's a different kind of a movie despite it has gangsters in it. The movies I've mentioned more or before more or less tell the same story of hero raising to the top of the criminal world and then falling into hell . 'The Untouchables' is more of a  western . It's a story about group of people that couldn't stand the injustice in their city anymore and decided to fight with it by all means necessary. Yes , it's very entertaining , but it has a lot of heart and substance too.As one of the heroes says everybody knows where evil hides , it's just nobody wants to do anything about it ( out of fear , apathy or corruption) . To fight evil you have to be even more ruthless than the criminals . You have to sometimes do illegal methods (torture , blackmail). You have to get dirty if you want to keep the streets clean . You have to be brave , because it might cost you family or life . That's the whole movie is about . It's all in the story of Elliott Ness . When we first meet him his a honest and idealistic , yet unexperienced and soft rookie when it comes to fighting crime . Through the movie he will become tough , charismatic and confident crime fighter.I don't agree with opinion that characters are one dimensional . Ness (Kevin Costner) as I've mentioned earlier changes through the movie . Malone (Sean Connery) is a true mentor for our heroes . He's bitter and lonely old man when we meet him . Later , he will become a father figure for the rest of group . He's wise , strong willed , cynical and determined . Stone (Andy Garcia) is a young rebel with a softer side. Oscar (Charles Martin Smith ) works as a good comic relief , yet people forget he's also intelligent and brave. Al Capone ( Robert de Niro) deep down is nothing , but a simple primitive street thug , yet he hides it under his gentleman behavior.Sean Connery quite probably gives the best performance of his career . The Oscar was deserved . I'm not a fan of Kevin Costner , yet he fits the role of Ness PERFECTLY . Along with 'Silverado ' it's his best performance . He's character could be very boring since he is so noble and all , but Costner makes him a true human being you can care for. Robert de Niro has a rather small screen time and many complained about that . Still , he plays Capone with obvious irony and that makes his character memorable.Let's not forget about Billy Drago (Frank Vitti) , Richard Bradford (Mike) , Jack Kehoe (Payne ) and Patricia Clarkson ( Ness wife) . They all give solid support to the main stars of the movie . The music by Ennio Morricone is BEAUTIFUL .'Four friends ' , 'The Death theme' , ' Al Capone's theme ' , ' The Strength of the righteous ' and 'The Untouchables' . Beautiful tracks . I need to get the soundtrack . Along with Basil Poleudoris music for 'Robocop' this was the best soundtrack in 1987 . The art direction-set decoration and costumes are wonderful. The movie looks very elegant and takes you right into the prohibition era. David Mamet created a screenplay with incredibly stylish and memorable dialogues . Along the way there are also some surprising twists and good character development . Brian de Palma has outdone himself with the direction . He gives the audience brilliant shootout scene (obviously inspired by 'Pancernik Potiomkin') , great chase scene and assassination scene . I loved the first person perspective in one important scene and the various camera angles through the movie . It's also worth noticing that 'The Untouchables' is one of few movies that shows how violence hurts and affects lives of the characters , just like in real life it would. I cry during this movie about 4 times , but I'm not gonna spoil the movie . Awesome . I give it 9/10.",9,1,2,25 July 2013
The Matrix Reloaded," Gibberish sequel number one
","*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS I still remember the excitement when I was waiting (just like the rest of the word) for Matrix sequels . I can't say I'm Matrix maniac , but the Matrix universe that was crafted by Wachowski brothers ( well , now brother and sister ) had so much potential that one could expect great things to come . Sadly , the sequels turned out to be not only not as good as they should be , but also made people seriously doubt the quality of the original movie.'Reloaded ' gives us more of the Matrix universe . We get to see Zion – humanity's home . We are also introduced to few new characters that are either the part of Matrix – The Architect , Serafin, Cluemaster , Merowing , Persephona or human inhabitants – Niobe , Zee , Captain Mifune.We also learn few more things about the story of Matrix – this is the 6th version of Matrix , The Chosen one is just another form of control , The Architect is the father and The Oracle is the mother of Matrix and that Agent Smith is getting out of control .The movie seems to flow in a simple way : a little bit of action – a little bit of philosophy – a little bit of action - a little bit of philosophy . It feels too mechanical and it's annoying after a while and on repeated viewings . Not to mention that the action scenes are strangely flat and unexciting . The only action scene that is truly superb and can compare to the visual beauty of the first movie is the highway chase . Everything works there . There is tension , fun , visual beauty and even humor. From what I've heard it took them a lot of money and time to make it work , but it was worth the effort . Too bad that is the only action piece worth watching . The other action scenes feel generic (at least by Matrix standards ) and are often incredibly forced into the story – for example , why Neo is wasting his time fighting copies of Agent Smith if he could just fly away ? The fight takes a few minutes and is rather unintentionally laughable. Another forced action sequence is at Merowing's home when Persephona helps our heroes , yet she calls her husband for no real reason , so the movie can put another action sequence. On the plus side the special effects are definitely impressive even after all those years.The movie tries to build the relationship between Neo and Trinity , but I have to say it just doesn't work for me . It came out of nowhere in the first movie and despite more screen time here it still feels fake and unconvincing . Even the sex scene doesn't help. Not to mention that Wachowski also put a cringe worthy 'orgasm scene ' and the subplot with Persephone that wants to be loved , so 'kiss me like you would kiss her' . Yuck.First movie had some tendency to be style over substance . Here , it's ALL style over substance . 90% of the dialogue is some gibberish pseudo-intellectual speech that pretends to be meaningful . It's obvious when you look at the talk between Neo and The Architect . They should put some subtitles there to explain what the hell The Architect is talking about. Funny thing – The Architect actually says simple things only in a rather confusing way . For example – Architect won't say 'You love Trinity so you won't do it' . Instead he says something like 'By the chemical reaction of the neutrons in your brain I can see that your subconscious already made the choice you're brain isn't willing to accept ' . LOL . Add the fact that he's not the only one here walking and talking about God-knows-what and prepare your head for two hours of pain.The movie ends with interesting cliffhanger, but it can't save the movie from the fact it's a disappointment. Putting aside the gibberish dialogue , action scenes , special effects, and the muddled details of this universe , there's nothing underneath this movie . First 'Matrix' was a brilliant metaphor of the world we are living today. 'Reloaded' feels like an empty bridge between part one and part three. The part three was supposed to be the conclusion 'Matrix' fans were waiting for. Too bad it was also a failure.I give it 2/10.",2,2,4,4 August 2013
The Departed," Better watch the original – Infernal affairs'
","Talk about undeserved Oscars  This movie definitely didn't deserved them . It's a sad thing that Academy decided to honor Scorsese with Oscar not only so late , but also with movie that didn't deserved it one bit . It's even more sad that so many people think it's a good movie . I disagree with that opinion.The movie suffers from bad acting from the three leading stars : DiCaprio , Damon and Nicholson. Matt Damon doesn't act at all . He just is in this movie . He breaths , he has open eyes and he speaks. That's it. Jack Nicholson plays his part in such way that would fit Burton's 'Batman returns' . He's overacting . He's campy , cheesy and not one bit dangerous. Unless you think that killing and eating a fly makes him dangerous . DiCaprio is also overacting , but at least he's switching from being 'very nervous' to 'very angry' from time to time. And who the f*** casts Anthony Anderson in a serious role of cop ?! That fat and unfunny piece of meat sticks out here like a sore thumb. The supporting actors are surprisingly much better than the trio of stars . Alec Baldwin , Martin Sheen and oh my God Mark Wahlberg give the best performances of the movie. I wasn't surprised by the fine performances of Baldwin and Sheen . I didn't expect Wahlberg to give such a good performance as the tough asshole cop. It's his best role since 'Boogie nights'.The movie has it's share of rather ridiculous twists that are hard to swallow . There is a big plot-hole involving a certain object that seems to be important for the story for almost 70% of the movie , yet it strangely disappears and none of the characters seems to care ! Not to mention the indestructible cell phone.The movie is badly directed . Scorsese fails to recreate the psychological tension of the original, so he uses the simple way to do it – by making characters shout very often and punch each other . The wonderful sense of sorrow and tragedy that you could feel in the Asian movie is also gone . Instead there is a lot of loud music . And the shootouts look absolutely terrible , like something that Michael Bay could direct.The movie ends differently than 'Infernal affairs ' and it's a really bad thing . Not to mention that the whole symbol with the rat is just pathetic . In the end you might realize that you have just seen an empty and bad cop thriller. I give it 4/10.",4,3,4,19 August 2013
Man on Fire," Good action/thriller
","Man on fire' is a good movie that ranges in tone from sentimental to brutal . It's the second adaptation of A.J Quinnell's novel with the same title . The first was made in the 80's . Denzel Washington is great as Creasy , a former CIA assassin who searches for redemption . He's got a death wish and he tries to find meaning of life in Bible and alcohol . A friend (Christopher Walken ) finds him a job in Mexico City as a bodyguard . He has to protect Pita (Dakota Fanning) – daughter of wealthy family from kidnapping . Mexico City in this movie is a grim and unpleasant place where almost every day people are kidnapped . If you thought that only movies from 70's and 80's were able to show big cities as hell on Earth you're wrong. Kidnapping , violence , greed , corruption – it's all here. No wonder Quentin Tarantino likes this movie. Anyway , friendship is growing slowly between Creasy and Pita . The relationship between them kinda reminds me of the relationship between Natalie Portman and Jean Reno in 'Leon'. Creasy becomes a father figure for Pita and she in return brings some joy in his life. Tony Scott (RIP) was able to capture those intimate moments beautifully. Washington and Fanning have a great chemistry together. You have to wait for some action until the half of movie , when the tragedy occurs . The first half of the movie feels like a melodrama ( a good one I must say ) , while the second half turns into detective story (Creasy is searching for answers and eliminating bad guys ) . I was all in tears at the end.Washington gives a very emotional and engaging role . Creasy tries to appear stoic for the whole world , but the viewer is able to feel his pain in smallest gestures or words . Fanning makes Pita an incredible lovely , easy-going but also quite mature character . I'm surprised she didn't received Oscar nominee for her role.Christopher Walken, Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, Mickey Rourke also appear in this movie and give a solid support . I wish we could see more of Walken's character . He's good in his role , but I still feel he was kinda wasted in here.Tony Scott makes this movie more than just a simple 'revenge movie' . His able to capture the drama , while still making the movie entertaining and never boring despite it's quite long time. The screenplay written by Brian Helgeland is intelligent and gives 'MOF' a feel of 70's movie . Some of the dialogues are wonderful and very memorable : -'A man can be an artist. In anything, food, whatever. It depends on how good he is at it. Creasey's art is death. He's about to paint his masterpiece'. -'Forgiveness is between them and God. It's my job to arrange the meeting ' <ul><li>'I am the sheep that got lost, Madre ' </li></ul>Paul Cameron's cinematography is stylish , while the Editing by Christian Wagner has clarity. I still think the movie is too flashy for it's own good . It was probably supposed to create a chaotic feeling matching Creasy's emotions. I understand that , but it was over-used . After some time my eyes were tired and I was really glad for every scene without flashy visuals . Oh , and the movie is half an hour too long.There is some raw brutality in this action drama . The scenes of carnage and violence are both intense and suspenseful . There are some nasty murder and torture scenes here. Good music too. Overall , this is a good movie from Tony Scott . I give it 8/10.",7,0,0,22 June 2013
Army of Darkness," A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court by Sam Raimi
","That's what I thought when I first saw the movie . I wonder why didn't they call it 'Evil Dead 3' ? After all it's part of that story . Oh well.The movie is definitely not for everyone . It moves fast , real fast . The characters are barely written . And of course the wild sense of humor won't please everybody . You have to admire Raimi's imagination. The whole movie feels like a crazy mix of cartoon + horror + grindhouse movies.Bruce Campbell rocks as Ash in his macho performance . I can't imagine any other actor playing this part. Yes , sometimes he overacts , but the whole movie has that hiper-active feel to it. The music by Joseph LoDuca is great and the special effects after all these years still look quite good .Compare to two previous movies this one is rather light in terms of violence . Some people might be disappointed with it. Anyway , I had fun . My favourite scene is in the mill.I give it 8/10. Mark Twain would be proud. Watch out for Sam Raimi in a small role of knight.",8,2,3,24 July 2013
Con Air," Loud , brash , over the top action movie extravagance
","'Con air' defines the term 'popcorn movie'. It's an action film designed strictly to entertain. The film is over-the-top with over-the-top characters, dialogue and situations that are just too unbelievable to happen in real life. It's done DELIBERATELY . 'Con Air' is pure cartoonish excess from start to finish . A genuine escapism. At no point does this film ever take itself seriously. I cant help but feel that people who didn't liked this movie haven't realized the joke.The movie was inspired by a newspaper article about a plane that transports convicts. The story does have resemblance to 'Die hard'. Anyway , the story is rather thin , full of holes and the characters are one dimensional The screenplay however deserves praise for the dialogues and colorful characters.Direction by Simon West is great. He has a quick-cut, music-video sensibility . The film moves along at a brisk pace, cheerfully glossing over its own improbabilities, you might even not notice the plot holes because things are happening so quick. West manages to cut from one story arc to another with a certain amount of skill, keeping each arc from completely snowballing into something unmanageable. West keeps you on the edge of your seat with the non stop action. There are multiple destructions of all kinds throughout the film and countless explosions. From one devastating climax to another devastating climax. At the end you'll be left breathless and your senses stinging with over-stimulation. The corny emotional sequences, however, ring completely hollow.There is a hell of impressing cast here : John Malkovich ( superb as crazy bad motherf***** Cyrus The Virus) , Steve Buscemi ( a brilliant pastiche of Hannibal Lecter with his Garland Greene) , John Cusack ( nice good guy) , Ving Rhames ( great as intellectual black racist) , Danny Trejo ( good as sadistic rapist Johnny 23) , Dave Chappelle (the first and only time he was funny – as Pinball) and finally Nicolas Cage ( a weird mix of Jesus and Rambo , but it works).Also the lesser known actors deserve applause : Renoly (as the gay prisoner Sally Can't Dance) , Colm Meaney (as the asshole cop) , Mykelti Williamson ( as the always suffering Baby O) , Rachel Ticotin ( as tough guard Sally Bishop) and Monica Potter (as the loving wife Tricia Poe).The movie is full of great dialogues and one liners . Here are some of my favourite quotes : 'Define irony: a bunch of idiots dancing around on a plane to a song made famous by a band that died in a plane crash.' And 'Insanity, I'll tell you what insanity is: spending sixty years working in an office only to end up in an old folks home to die an undignified death while trying to get to the toilet – that is insanity' . Who could forget 'Put the bunny down' or 'He's got the whole world in his hands'.Non stop action and hundreds of classic one-liners, what's here not to love ? 'Con air' it's an endlessly re-watchable genuine action movie escapism. Lynrynd Skynryd ' Sweet home Alabama' is a song that reminds me of this movie . Simple , unambitious , fun and charming . Just like 'Con air' . I give it 7/10.",6,0,0,16 August 2013
American Gangster," Nothing new or too deep , but very entertaining
","American gangster' is a gangster movie that doesn't add anything new to the genre . It's weaker than classics such as 'Godfather' , 'Godfather 2' , 'Goodfellas' or 'Casino' , yet it's a strong movie on it's own . To be honest it isn't pure gangster movie . The story of cop Richie is just as important as the story of gangster Frank . In a way the movie reminds kinda Michael Mann's 'Heat'. The movie is long and epic . The whole picture has a 'French Connection' feel. It's an entertaining portrait of late 60s-early 70s Harlem and America. Lots of drugs , Vietnam war , desperation , world where cops are as dirty (or even dirtier) than gangsters. As Richie says at one point of the movie all those cops , judges , lawyers , district attorneys are really too happy with the fact that drugs exist , because it gives them work. Lawlessness and organized crime exists because of the mutual benefit that the gangsters have with the law . No one, including the law, wants it to stop. The movie offers real-life look into the narcotics business top-to-bottom and across the board. It also shows what it means to be a cop and to strive for something.The story is based on true life of Frank Lucas who here isn't a stereotypical black gangster gone wrong , but instead an elegant, intelligent man who rises to the top. Denzel Washington shines here . He's menacing , confident , cold and feisty. In my opinion he did a good job making his character different than the bad guy he portrayed in 'Training day'. 'American gangster' is also a story of Ritchie Roberts , a cop who defeated him. He's character is much less interesting , since he's basically a boy scout , yet Russell Crowe manages to create a likable character . He was able to convince me about the pure innocence of his character. Roberts and Lucas may be operating on opposite sides of the law, the one thing that both men have in common is a strict code of ethics that separates them from their opportunistic colleagues.The movie also has interesting supporting characters . Josh Brolin turns in an outstanding and memorable performance as Trupo, a decidedly sinister and shady cop . Ruby Dee rightfully deserved the Oscar nomination for her role of Lucas mother . It was good to see Cuba Gooding Jr. in a good movie with a good performance for a change. Chiwetal Ejifor makes a believable side character. Armand Assante gives a god performance as the mob boss. 'American gangster' is truly engrossing and captivating picture that I did not once find it boring or slow at all. The pacing to was just right to have enough of a character study going on, but also enough to keep audience interested and entertained. Ridley Scott did a great job as the director . He also improved as an action director - police raid scene is really great. This movie is a good addition to the genre of gangster movies . We haven't yet seen a really good movie with black gangster until this one. I give it 6/10.",6,0,1,1 November 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," The legend ends with a bang – don't listen to haters
","Do not compare 'TDKR' to 'TDK' because it's completely different movie. It's a simpler story , more character driven , slower paced and the most comic bookish movie in the trilogy. Realism and real life logic gets replaced with comic book logic at some point. The series were never really 100 % realistic , but this movie requires sometimes a lot of suspension disbelief from the viewer.The first 40 minutes is busy jumping between characters new and old, and setting up many sub-plots. Storytelling takes time to get to the main plot . The movie leaves the viewer with many blanks that he has to fill on his own. That's why many people were complaining about the plot holes that don't actually exist. If you think for a while you will find answers . Other flaws - very dialogue-heavy , underwritten character of Miranda Tate and undeveloped romance between Miranda and Bruce , some cheesy scenes. I liked that Bruce Wayne had a lot of screen time , but some people might have problem with not enough of Batman.I loved Tom Hardy's Bane . His menacing voice that sounds like a mix of Darth Vader and Sean Connery . He speaks in a calm manner like a philosopher and is intimidating to everyone. Bane has a raw physicality rarely seen on the big screen. Look closely at his body language (eyes and gestures). It's an intelligent beast. While not as fascinating as Joker it's definitely memorable and entertaining villain with tragic back-story.Anne Hathaway never looked more beautiful and sexy than here as Catwoman . Her mannerisms and voice perfectly captured the character . Her morality is as flexible as her body. She's feisty , sly, dangerous, charismatic and unpredictable. She has a troubled past but also conscious and wants something more out of life. She and Batman are soul mates- so different , yet so similar. The romance between them is one of the better I've seen. The chemistry between her and Bale is great , you can see the sparks flying.'TDKR' feels more like a drama , with action in the background . The mid air stunt , bike chase and the takeover of Gotham are quite impressive. The fights are the best in trilogy and full of emotions. Nolan leaves the best for the finale – the last 30 minutes are absolutely breathtaking. It's really epic with the two armies , heroes, villains , truck chase and a bomb. The climax is thrilling. The last 5 minutes are very touching and fitting end for great saga . The whole movie has a lot of heart.It's a story about masks , pain , trust , redemption and hope. 'TDKR' makes a social commentary about economic inequality , capitalism and Occupy Wall Street movement. Capitalism is flawed , but a flawed system is better than anarchy lead by populists . The movie is a warning to the world to search for some solution before it's too late.Cinematography by Wally Pfister (his last movie with Nolan) is still great . Hans Zimmer (without James Newton Howard this time) repeats most of the music themes from previous movies , however the new ones (Bane and Catwoman theme) are really cool. The special effects deserved Oscar nomination. Only editing seems to be clumsy at times.There are countless nods and references to classic comic books stories – 'The Dark knight returns' , 'Son of a demon' , 'Batman year one' ,'No man's land' , 'Knightfall .... A lot of inspiration of the story is out of classic 'Tale of Two Cities' (1859) by Charles Dickens , about French revolution. Movie fans will be reminded of 'Metropolis' , 'Superman 2' , 'Rocky 3' , 'Batman returns' and even 'Batman' with Adam West (!) .This movie divided people and suffered death from many nitpicks. I was very satisfied with Nolan's conclusion to Batman legend. It's not without flaws , but the good definitely outweighs the bad. It keeps the high level of quality of whole series and gets better with each view. It's better than people say. I give it 8/10.",8,3,7,18 May 2015
Blade Runner," Who am I ? Where do I come from ? Where I'm going to ?
","This review is based on Directors Cut version – the version with no voice-over and no 'Hollywood-ending'.The film is loosely based on 'Do androids dream of electric sheep' (1969) by Philip K. Dick. There are several changes to the original book which itself was very surrealistic. The spirit however of Dick's book is still here. The film brings in some ideas that improve on the book and writers Hampton Fincher and David Webb Peoples deserve some praise. Philip K Dick himself approved of the film , although he saw only the opening 20 minutes of footage prior to his death on 2 March 1982. It's interesting that Ridley Scott and one of the writers David Webb Peoples never read Dick's novel. 'Blade runner' was the first time that Dick had been adapted to film.'Blade runner' asks the same question as the book – What it means to be a human ? Philip K Dick read diaries written by S.S. men and was shocked by the sheer cruelty and lack of empathy he found in them . He thought that those Germans didn't deserve to be called humans , despite the look like ones. That's where the idea for book came from.'Blade runner ' requires patience and full attention from the audience. There is little action here and the movie is very slow paced. The story seems very simple , almost thin on the surface , but underneath it there's a depth really seen. 'BR' is so full of themes and symbols that it's impossible to catch them all on first viewing . I've seen this movie five times and I'm still discovering new things on repeated viewings. It's just as deep as '2001 : Space odyssey', but far more entertaining and involving emotionally thank Kubrick's movie. Who could forget the unicorn at the end ? 'Blade runner' is a visionary movie. It pretty much pioneers much of the vision that became a Cyberpunk genre in publishing. William Gibson , considered a pioneer of that genre with his 'Neuromancer' (1984) almost gave up writing , because 'BR' had so much of his vision in it. 'BR' is a rare case of movie prefiguring a trend in literature. 'BR' also inspired many movies with it's vision of killer robots ('Terminator' is the most known and the best of them all).It's one of the most visually beautiful movies I have ever seen. The level of detail on is amazing, even though much of it is often seen on screen. It gives you the impression that what you see is only the tip of an iceberg. The future we see is an abstraction of the present. Los Angeles in 2019 is an overpopulated city, with flying cars , non-stop rain , extremely diverse culturally (punks , Chinese , Jews and Hare Krishna living together in one metropolis) and full of commercials (Atari , Coca cola). Designer Syd Mead and FX wizard Douglas Trumbull deserve every penny the studio paid them for this piece of art. The special effects are genuinely AMAZING after all those years and the movie has dated incredibly well .The music by Vangelis fits the movie perfectly . It's so mythical and dream-like , with a touch of 80's feel as well. It's one of the greatest soundtracks ever . The movie gives the viewer a haunting melancholic feel and largely thanks to the superb music.'Blade runner' wants the audience to think about the impact of technology and capitalism on human society , dehumanization in world ruled by corporations and media , meaning of life , personal identity , destructive nature of humanity , lack of freedom and polluted environment.Harrison Ford ('Raiders of lost ark') is great as a burned out detective with a weakness for drinking Frank Deckard (reference to Descartes). His lifeless performance fits the movie perfectly . His dull , bored , cold character that slowly during the movie will rediscover (or discover ?) his humanity thanks to the replicants. The real star is however Rutger Hauer ('The Hitcher') as Roy Batty. His fantastic performance is perfect – he managed to capture all of human emotions : child-like sense of wonder , fear of death , raw brutality , deep love , need for beauty. His not a simple villain , more like anti-hero who is in a way a portrait of whole humanity. The third main character is Rachel played by Sean Young ('No way out'). While very sexy and a obvious nod to femme fatales from noir movies , Young also makes her character a very delicate and likable.The supporting performances are great too . Edward James Olmos ('Stand and deliver') is really creepy, mysterious and memorable as Gaff (who could forget his little paper figures) . M. Emmett Walsh ('Few good men') makes a nice cynical police chief. Daryl Hannah (Kill Bill') has some Harley Quinn personality in her Pris. Joanna Cassidy ('Who framed Roger Rabbit') is strong as Zhora , while Brion James ('48 hours') is menacing as Leon. Joe Turkel ('The Shinning') is a true gentleman as the intelligent Eldon Tyrell.This is the best science fiction movie ever made. It might be the best movie of the 80's and it's a strong contender for the title of the best movie ever made. Ridley Scott is talking now about making a sequel . Considering how awful 'Prometheus' was ( a semi-prequel to 'Alien') I hope this will never happen. I give 'Blade runner' 10/10.",10,0,5,31 December 2013
Space Jam," I loved it as a kid ...
","Michael Jordan . Bugs Bunny . Together in one movie . Which kid could resist that ? I still remember how I laughed as a kid , when I was watching this movie for the first time. I did watch it at least a couple of times and I still have good memories regarding it . So , I was surprised not in a positive way when I saw the not too good rating (5.9) of 'Space jam' here on IMDb. Also while surfing the web I often found not too many pleasant comments from other people about this movie . It gave me motivation to find some free time to watch 'SJ' and confront my childhood's memories with reality. After all many things that we've liked as kids aren't that good when we look at them from the point of view of adult.So , I've seen the movie for the first time since childhood . And you know what ? The film itself lacks either the energy or the visual invention that the Chuck Jones originals had. For visual humour, it tends to substitute one-liners and lame pop culture in-jokes.'Space jam' not only has Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny in it , but also Wayne Knight ('Jurassic park') , Bill Murray ('Ghostbusters') , famous basketball players ( Larry Johnson , Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing ) and all the Looney tunes characters . 'Space jam' also introduces original characters to the audience – the aliens ( Moonstars) and Lola . I must say that I love Lola . She's a great original Looney Tunes character . She's a wonderful partner for Bugs , yet she has her own personality. I wish that Warner Bros would use her in the future , especially if the will make new Looney Tunes cartoons. The aliens are also nice . Moonstars look funny as the caricatures of famous basketball players . The certainly are memorable villains , just like their boss.The animation looks alright to me . Only the CGI alien amusement park has dated badly . Joe Pytka directs the movie like a normal movie with some cartoon elements in it instead of choosing Joe Dante way in 'Looney tunes back in action' and making it a live action cartoon. In terms of acting Bugs and team are the best . Murray and Knight give a fun performance . Jordan and others are OK since they basically playing themselves.The soundtrack is good with great songs like : R. Kelly ' I believe I can fly ' , Seal 'Fly like eagle ' , Coolio , LL Cool J and Method Man 'Beat them up'.'Space Jam' is a feature-length expansion of a Pepsi commercial that paired Bugs Bunny and NBA star Michael Jordan. It'sa disappointment. I give it 3/10.",3,6,13,2 October 2013
Bull Durham," Good fun not only for baseball fans
","This is unfairly forgotten sports comedy . It's far better than the more famous and overrated 'Major league'. I'm not exactly a fan of sport comedies , but this one is one of the best I've seen.The movie really heavily on the trio of stars : Kevin Costner ('Dancing with the wolves') , Susan Sarandon ('Dead man walking') and Tim Robbins ('The Shawshank Redemption'). Each of them shines here. Costner is charming and very likable as the smart and bitter old baseball player. Sarandon is incredibly funny as the woman obsessed with baseball and sex . Robbins is very convincing as the incredibly talented , but stuck up young baseball player.I like that this movie doesn't follow a typical 'from zero to hero' story that is so often (TOO often) seen in this type of movies. Instead we got here a story about love triangle between two baseball players and baseball fan . The movie is a character comedy and it's fun to see how the characters interact with each other and change during the movie. There is great chemistry between them.I love the wisecracks from Costner's mouth , Sarandon is HOT and Robbins is adorable when he throws into the bull.There is some great music here . Soundtrack is full of great songs like: Bill Haley and The Comets 'Rock around the clock' , Edith Piaf 'Non , je ne regrette rien' and 'La vie en rose' , Ike and Tina Turner 'I idolize you' , The Everly brothers 'When I will be loved' , Los lobos 'I got loaded' and Joe Cocker 'Woman loves a man'.The only thing that I didn't like is the religious approach to the baseball. I'm not a fan of baseball and I couldn't really relate to it, but the baseball fans probably will be happy.A very pleasant , charming and enjoyable comedy. Good way to spend your time. I give it 7/10.",7,1,1,31 December 2013
Signs," People who believe and the ones who don't believe
","'Signs' is a movie that divided people even more than great and underrated 'Unbreakable'. It isn't a 'War of the worlds ' or 'Independence day' type of movie . It isn't really about alien invasion. It's about faith and losing it . The aliens are only catalyst for that theme. It's a movie about human condition.The idea of making a serious movie about faith based on aliens and crop circle in plantation is very risky . I think that while not everything worked in the end , Shyamalan actually comes victorious . 'Signs' does fall apart in the end . The logical questions about aliens that audience have aren't answered and the final twist is rather laughable. Still as a drama it succeeds. Shyamalan leads his heroes masterfully. We really care about them and can imagine ourselves in their situation. Shyamalan never fails to create suspense too. There is a great tension here and some of the scenes are really scary . Why ? Because Shyamalan wonderfully plays with viewers imagination and he knows that what you don't see is what scares the most.James Newton Howard's score is great , while Tak Fujimoto's photography is sublime. Good performances from Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix.I'm hoping that Shyamalan will be able to make once again a good movie. It would be shame for such good director to end his career too soon. I'm still waiting and hoping for his comeback. I give it 7/10.",7,1,2,30 November 2013
Beowulf," Not bad , but why not live action movie ?
","The CGI is good , sometimes great in this movie. Grendel is actually scary . Grendel is a lovely creation, oozing slime and blood, and wrecked with pain. The dragon and the witch are also impressive. The only and biggest problem are the faces of the characters . They look fake and completely devoid of emotions . It kinda destroys all the hard work of actors . The gave their best and certainly Anthony Hopkins , Ray Winstone , Robin Wright Penn and Angelina Jolie deserve compliments. By the way the CGI Jolie looks HOT , really HOT .I don't know if this movie is aimed at kids or adults . Personally I think it's a much more suited for adults . There is violence , erotic images and a serious issue like responsibility that might be too hard to understand for children .I don't understand why Beowulf is naked in one moment of the movie , so the movie makers had to work hard not to show anything of his 'family jewels' to the audience . Also , despite that the CGI is really good I was wondering why Zemeckis couldn't make it as a live action movie ? I'm pretty sure that it wouldn't look worse than what we have here.A nice movie for fantasy fans . Brainless pure entertainment. I give it 5/10.",5,0,1,1 November 2013
The Sixth Sense," I see dead people and I see a wonderful movie
","It's sad that the career of M. Night Shyamalan went so wrong . After the brilliant ' The Sixth sense' he made great and underrated 'Unbreakable' and flawed but good 'Signs'. He lost his touch with 'The village' and every next movie he made was worse and worse. Now his name is some sort of joke and people criticize even his best movies . 'The Sixth sense' is an object of many attacks with 'overrated' and 'boring' being the most popular words from the critics of this movie.This movie was inspired by episode of TV series 'Are you afraid of the dark ?' . It's a cross between 'The Exorcist' and 'Ordinary people' . It explains why the movie is both really scary and heartbreaking. It relies on imagination and psychology to scare you . It's really scary despite the PG-13 rating. Actually 'SS' is really a thriller full of many small twists and fantastical finale. Some people say that since the guessed right the finale it means the movie is bad. That's not true (Hitchcock's 'Psycho' is a masterpiece despite rather predictable ending). It is impossible to make a twist totally unpredictable. While I agree that there is a stretch in terms of logic the finale is still incredibly clever – the movie doesn't keep any important facts in secret , it's our point of view that fools us. A movie must work on its own terms before springing a surprise. This movie certainly does.It works as a thriller , as a horror , but more importantly as a drama. You care about what happens to Cole Sear and Dr. Malcolm Crowe . You want everything to workout for Cole and his mother. There are many heartbreaking scenes in this movie – the broken window in the shop , the talk in the hospital , the talk in the car and the confession from Dr. Crowe to his wife.Bruce Willis gives an great performance against his macho image , Haley Joel Osment is extraordinary , Toni Collette is underrated for her superb performance , and the performance of Donnie Wahlberg mustn't be forgotten.The directing by Shyamalan is superb - excellent use of colors , mirrors and shadows, the lighting, eccentric camera viewpoint, psychological tension Screenplay is rich , full of great dialogue and incredibly realistic human interactions . Who could forget the famous 'I see dead people' line.Don't listen to critics . Great art defends itself. I give it 9/10.",9,0,0,7 December 2013
Looper," Disappointing time travel movie from start to finish
","*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS 'Looper' is one of those movies that promises much because it seems to be based on interesting ideas , yet the ending result is terribly poor. Why this movie received positive reviews is beyond me The plot of this movie just isn't as good as it seemed on paper . If you think for a second it all falls apart . This story was written by someone who does not comprehend even the basics of time travel problems and paradoxes. There is a certain suspension of disbelief in any time travel movie. You can forgive one or two plot holes and odd paradoxes in films about time travel but there are just far too many here and they are all far too obvious. However, they DO establish certain rules about time travel during the film. When a movie breaks it's own set of rules it's just BAD WRITING. The whole premise of a 'Looper' was never satisfactorily explained. I don't buy that in the future it's impossible to get rid off a body in the future because of the tracking . Seriously , there ALWAYS was and will be way to deal with that problem , especially for the mob. * It's never explained HOW mob is able to time travel. Did they invented time vehicle or stole it ? * Mob has got a time travel machine and uses it ONLY to get rid off the bodies ?! Why not use it to take over the world ?! * Why does the mo needs the loopers ? Couldn't they simply send somebody back 10,000 years, or to the middle of the ocean ? * Why send ALIVE person through time ? Kill that somebody in the future , then send his dead body in the past. Done. No risk of failure. * Furthermore why not send a paper with somebody's name to the past and have an assassin to kill that person in the past ? * Why did they always get THE SAME looper to close THEIR OWN loop? The had at least few loopers to choose from* Why even have more than one looper ? * Why the mafia boss who owns the city lives in some underground basement ? * Why are the telekinetic powers of most people so weak, but the power of the Rainmaker so strong ? * Why is everyone using civil war era firearms prone to jamming, when there are plenty of high tech weapons around in both eras ? * Why won't the Rainmaker simply use telekinesis to kill the loopers ? * How come a guy who kills for a living suddenly has a cry baby heart and goes out to protect people ? * The ending doesn't make sense . Young Joe kills himself, which erases old Joe from the time line. So all the criminals he killed and the loopers are okay now? How is the kid STILL wounded ? Joe couldn't have lived to meet the woman in China and eventually travel back in time, which means he couldn't have ever caused his past self to meet the Rainmaker. The Rainmaker would have grown up and taken over the world in the same way he did before, and Bruce Willis's wife would still be dead.This movie is insulting to the audience. At one point Bruce Willis screams 'It doesn't matter ! ' as if trying to make a pathetic excuse for all the plot holes and inconsistencies.Putting aside that 'Looper' is illogical movie and you have to turn off your brain to watch it , it's just a dull movie. The future world was incredibly poorly realised. The directing and editing were utterly terrible. Most of the time it looked like the director was trying to be stylish, instead of actually making a good film. The pacing is horribly disjointed. The film moves very slowly .'Looper' has all the pretense of being an edge of the seat sci-fi thriller, but then proceeds to bore you to death, and continually tries to pull on heart strings without having earned the right. Neither old Joe or young Joe are particularly likable. You have no REAL reason to care about anybody . The movie lacks interesting dialogue and there is virtually no action. When it happens it's SO UNINSPIRED without a small bit of excitement.'Looper' borrows elements from many movies : '2009 Lost memories' , 'Terminator' , '12 monkeys' , 'Matrix' , 'The One' and few others. I wouldn't mind it if the movie was able to make something interesting of them , but unfortunately this is not the case here.The movie doesn't have anything interesting to offer in terms of visual style or music. The acting is OK . Joseph Gordon Levitt ('500 days of summer'), Bruce Willis ('Die hard') , Emily Blunt ('Adjustment bureau') and Jeff Daniels ('Speed') aren't bad , but their acting is simply bland and forgettable like the movie itself. The problem is also that all the characters are barely written and impossible to care about. The change of heart by young Joe is simply unconvincing.'Looper' is stupid and dull movie. Avoid it. One of the biggest disappointments of 2012. I give it 1/10.",1,3,6,23 February 2014
The Great Escape," Epic escape movie
","This movie is based on real life story . For dramatic purposes some things were changed , yet it isn't a complete fiction . The movie manages to be both entertainment and a honest tribute to the real-life prisoners.The cast includes stars like Steve McQueen , James Gardner , Charles Bronson , Richard Attenbourgh and James Coburn. No Oscar worthy performances here , but more than solid team work makes it a pleasure to watch . Each character has got it's own personality and is memorable. The dialogues are full with sly sense of humor ('There's a madness in this method' , 'I'm watching him. I'm a lifeguard') . The whole movie is full of gentle and effective humor ( for example McQueen and stolen keys , McQueen and potatoes) . The screenplay is good , with believable and clever solutions to problems of prisoners (What to do with the sand ? ) .This movie is a war comedy , yet it has a heart. The movie becomes more and more serious the closer the end . Unlike most of today's Hollywood movies the drama here is connected with the comedy completely naturally.'The Great escape' isn't a depressing drama , but it never forgets about the humanity of it's heroes . There is fear , loss and paranoia here too. There are two really heartbreaking scenes here – the motorbike chase and the sacrifice of one of the prisoners . In the end the movie asks important question – was it worth it ? It REALLY depends on your point of view.A true classic. Epic in it's length (2 hours 42 minutes) , yet never boring . Satisfying both as entertaining comedy and drama. I give it 9/10.",9,1,2,7 December 2013
Moon," A movie just as empty as the space itself
","There are some good things about 'Moon'. Sam Rockwell ('The Matchstick men') deserves some praise for his performance. I would even say it's an Oscar worthy performance. He captures many different emotions of his hero (loneliness , boredom , depression , anger , psychosis) and gives a true one man show through all movie. I also liked Kevin Spacey ('American beauty') as the voice of robot.Clint Mansell delivers a gentle music that has something magical in it , something which screams 'SPACE'. His music is one of the strongest points of the movie. 'Moon' is also visually good looking . The special effects are few and well used. The art-direction reminds me of '2001 : Space odyssey' and that's a good thing.All of these doesn't change the fact that 'Moon' is dull , shallow , boring and pretentious movie. Some people were fouled by the fact that there are no explosions or too much action here and that the movie is relatively low budget. For some people that already means that a movie is ART. That this is a philosophical science fiction movie worthy of Stanley Kubrick. That's completely not true. I have seen few philosophical sci-fi movies in my life – '2001 : Space odyssey' , 'A Clockwork orange' , 'Solaris' , 'Stalker' . You could also add to them 'The Matrix' and 'Inception'. All of them ask philosophical questions , while the last two are also very entertaining. 'Moon' is definitely not an entertaining movie . It's also not a deep movie , even if it pretends to be meaningful.It's not about the fact that the story here is almost completely predictable and I have guessed the whole mystery after twenty minutes . It's also not about the fact that 'Moon' left me emotionally cold.It's about the fact that the whole movie PRETENDS to ask important questions , but it never really asks them . It's a movie where the viewer see what he wants to see. Some people will say it's a movie that asks what it means to be human , some will say that it asks about the morality of scientific experiment , some will say that it is about computer/robot becoming human , some will say that it's a heartbreaking story about loneliness and a deep allegory for whole humanity and so on and on 'Moon' is a movie about nothing. Get over it. There is no deep message or any substance here. It's just a quite well made trick to make you believe that there is some deeper meaning here while there isn't. Don't waste your time and better watch one of the sci-fi classics of Kubrick or Tarkovsky . They are deep and definitely hard to watch , but not boring movies. Why ? Because there is subtle message hidden underneath them. You could also watch 'Inception' or 'Matrix' – entertaining , high budget , commercial yes , but also deep movies.Don't let anybody full you that this pseudo-art is a deep movie. I give it 4/10.",4,3,14,23 February 2014
Donnie Darko," It's a very , very mad world
","'Back to the future' meets David Lynch – this is the way 'Donnie Darko' could be described to somebody who hasn't yet seen this movie . A movie too uncommercial and ambitious for mainstream Hollywood has become quickly a cult movie and gained fame. You will either love it or hate it. I love it.At it's heart 'DD' is a story about dysfunctional family. Donnie is intelligent , independent and sensitive teenager that can't communicate too well with his family , friends or teachers . It's a teenage drama told with honesty that is hard to find . It's easy to see that Kelly writes about something he did experience too. Not only Donnie isn't understood , but also Chinese girl Cherita , teacher Karen and his girlfriend Gretchen. It's a story about search for meaning of life , fear of death , looking for God , destiny and free will. All those subject are treated seriously and with subtlety. Jake Gyllenhal gives a performance of lifetime as emotionally troubled teenager. He portrays so many different emotions of Donnie with talent never found in his other roles. It's a performance that deserve at least an Oscar nomination. His real life sister Maggie Gyllenhal gives him solid support playing his sister. Patrick Swayze gives an interesting performance as the fraud Jim Cunningham. Drew Barrymore (who is also one of the producers of the movie) gives a surprisingly for her mature role as the teacher Karen. Bet Grant shines as fanatical teacher Kitty. I also admire Jena Malone for heartbreaking performance as the delicate Gretchen. 'DD' has a fantastical soundtrack , which includes songs like : 'The killing moon' by Echo and The Bunnymen , 'Head over hells' by Tears for fears , 'Notorious' by Duran Duran , 'Love will tear us apart' by Joy Division and especially 'Mad world' by Gary Jules and Michael Andrews. All the songs are well placed in the movie. The sequence where 'Mad world' appears is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen.Richard Kelly directs this movie in a fantastic way. With the help of atmospheric music by Michael Andrews and creepy photography by Steven Porter he creates a movie that is really dark . A true haunting sadness and mystery seems to be everywhere. The movie has soul and heart . It's sad , scary and full of black humor. It's art , not entertainment despite using a pop culture imagery (time travel portals , scary figures). It's also a tribute to the 80's (the action takes place in 1988).'Donnie Darko' can't be a masterpiece , because of one problem . Richard Kelly wanted to give the viewer as much freedom as possible to make his own interpretation of what is going on. The movie is open to interpretations – it was a dream , Donnie's imagination , God's interference , time travel paradox or side effect of pills. Kelly achieved that by hiding from the audience information necessary to really understand the movie the way it was always intended. The fact that the Director's cut and the official website exist is a proof that Kelly himself admits of failing to make 'Donnie Darko' a self-contained medium. Without most of the information from 'Philosophy of time travel' (it is expanded in the Director's cut) it's not strange that many viewer's weren't able to understand the complex story .It doesn't change the fact that 'Donnie Darko' is one of the most original , ambitious and thought-provoking movies I've ever seen. Richard Kelly will probably stay a one-hit wonder director . I doubt he will anything even half as good as 'DD' in the future. It doesn't change the fact that he created something that deserves to be admired – drama about loneliness , pain and fear told by using science fiction. I give it 9/10.",9,0,3,30 November 2013
Law Abiding Citizen," One of the worst movies ever made – endless stupidity and nihilism
","*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERSHollywood often makes very bad movies that insult viewer's intelligence. Take for example 'Transformers' (the whole series). I guess that sometimes people don't care for quality and just want to have some mind numbing dumb fun. There are movies fun despite being dumb and sometimes so dumb it's fun. The worst kind of movie for me is one that is incredibly dumb , yet thinks it's smart and has something important to say. 'Law abiding citizen' is that type of movie. It's not surprising considering this movie was created by Kurt Wimmer – responsible for the horrible 'Equilibrium'.On paper the story doesn't look bad – it's a classic story about man who lost his family , the justice system fails him so he decides to deliver justice on his own. It's been done before with good results – 'Death wish' , 'Punisher' and many other movies. 'LAC' pretends to be intelligent crime drama when in fact it's a retarded macho fantasy for the most primitive viewers.I can understand when a movie asks for suspension of belief . I can't accept when movie asks to abandon common sense, logic, intelligence , wisdom to make the movie work. Wimmer also doesn't care about police procedure, law and reality. The movie doesn't make sense from the very beginning.* Our main hero is an ex CIA assassin who lives in dangerous neighborhood. I guess that they don't pay him enough money to live in better place or at least to have better security. * Thank God in real life it's not as simple to enter somebody's house just by knocking to the door * The two thugs are acting and talking to our hero like this was supposed to be some kind of revenge ? They are acting like they know him and something more is going on , yet it was just a robbery ? I thought they were send by someone to kill him and his family for some reason. We didn't even get told why they wanted to kill Gerard and his family. * Ex CIA assassin is surprised that the justice system is flawed * The thugs are obviously guilty of murder since there was a witness who saw them invade his house and there was the presence dead bodies regardless of who did the actual killing. There was NO NEED to make a deal . The thug who raped our hero's wife left blood , sperm , hair and other traces of his sin and the police CAN'T PROVE IT WAS HIM ?! So Jamie Foxx needs to make a deal with one thug to punish the other ?! Pure idiocy. When someone dies in the commission of a felony - it's felony murder, usually the same as first degree murder for all participants (though not necessarily capital murder). So the initial and main plot device just doesn't work. * The word of killer in the court is stronger than our hero's word and the other thug's word. * Gerard waited 10 years for revenge . Talk about patience * Gerard is ex CIA assassin but his plans are simply unbelievable * The killer shoots at the police despite that they haven't seen him * The scene with 'sleeping cop' is just laughable * What was the point of recording the slaughter ? What was the point of sending DVD to Nick's house ? No real point in 'giving Nick a lesson' *All the city gets locked because of few killings ? *It's all Nick fault , but he gets a promotion *In prison nobody is smart enough to install camera or guard to keep an eye on him *Gerard built the tunnel leading to a prison and he simply walks out and walks in whenever he wants. *Why does Nick thinks that Gerard's investment in Panama has to do anything with the killings ? *The security of Philadelphia city government doesn't know how Gerard looks. No comment *Gerard installs bomb with delay ? Why ? Nick says they can't move it because it will explode. Yet he gets the bomb to the prison before Gerard ?! HOW ?! *When bomb explodes it doesn't burn the bed on which Gerard is sitting. The flames are surrounding him like an fallen angel Seriously , one of the worst endings EVER.The antihero Nick gets absolute redemption which is just pathetic even for such bad movie. The whole concept of justice has been prostituted into far fetched macho fantasy. There is no intelligence at work here , only stupidity and some predictability. There is no character you could care about and no good acting either.'Law Abiding Citizen' is far removed from anything of merit. The fact it has good rating on IMDb (7.4) scares me. Do really people have such bad taste ? I give it 1/10.",1,7,11,21 June 2014
V for Vendetta," Things I learned from V for Vendetta'
","1. EVERY priest is a pedophile . Or a sadist. 2. If you love your country automatically it means you're a fascist. EVERY patriot is a fascist. 3. EVERY homosexual is smart , sensitive , beautiful and so on. Homosexuals are the best people in the world. 4. If you don't like homosexuals you're a monster that hates them. 5. If you don't hate homosexuals and you just don't like them , you're still a monster. 6.When you're a dictator it's only normal to allow yours biggest enemy to send thousands of costumes . Because you are a dictator that controls EVERYTHING , except post offices. 7. When somebody cuts your long hair it's incredibly HUGE TRAGEDY . So big you have to cry. 8. If you want to make your hero look smart he should say things so obvious as :'Violence can be used for good' . Because the audience it's too dumb to know that .9. One facial expression and a lot of shouting is enough to make you a menacing dictator (shame on you John Hurt ). 10. When you're Natalie Portman you don't have to act in a movie. It's enough that you are in a movie . People will still say you gave good performance . God knows why. 11. Bullets in slow motion were cool ('The Matrix') , so let's put knifes in slow motion into movie. It doesn't matter it looks incredibly cheesy , like from video game . The director thinks it looks COOL . 12 . Put some unnecessary and unbelievable romance just because people like movies with some romance in it. 13. Put some anti-Bush propaganda in the movie , because you can't put anti-Thatcher propaganda that was in the comic book. 14. When you don't have anything smart to say use a cliché slogan – TV lies .Don't expand it .That's enough. People will still think you're movie is DEEP . It doesn't matter that movies like 'The Network ' or 'The Running man' had so much more to say on that subject. 15. Put a lot of pathos into your movie , so people won't be bored. MTV style rocks , right James McTeigue ?!The movie isn't boring and Hugo Veaving gave a good performance (voice). That's all good I can say on Wachowski's primitive movie based on less primitive , but still bad comic book by Alan Moore . Long live left-wing propaganda ! I give it 3/10.",3,5,10,22 June 2013
