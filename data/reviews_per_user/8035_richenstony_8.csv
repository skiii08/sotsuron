Skyfall," Over-Hyped Trash Biggest Regret of 2012 turns out to be Biggest win
","I was so so so upset when i called round all my local cinemas to book this only to find the only seats available where at the front point blank in front of the screen. Me and my wife just left it and waited for a DVD release.How good was it that we waited! What the hell is with all these directors trying to make a franchise into something its not! As sophisticated as bond is its certainly not bond without its romantic clichés and exploding pens. The whole film entirely pure dialogue and yeah i love dialogue but not 143 minutes of it! Its the end of a era and the end of my bond childhood ever being revisited on the big screen again. Bond is no longer bond , a lot of people argue these bond movies are the closet copy to Ian Flemings book and i have to agree they are. But if we have been brought up with Jetpacks , Exploding pens , plastic explosive tooth paste , villains with jaws made out of pure steel , and fantastic looking women why on earth would someone want to change that!I really do hate the fact someone has taken my childhood hero and turned him into something hes not. All I've ever asked from the franchise is the following!1: Kick ass starting scene (Casino royal delivered in that aspect)2: Gadgets , How can we not have Gadgets? So is bond to good for his gadgets now? Its pure bs! No one reading this cant deny when you saw those gadgets you got goosebumps and couldn't wait for bond to use them!3: Attractive women , Beauty is in the eye of the beholder , i be holding nothing for the last 3 films.4: The car! Same with the gadgets , we need to be introduced to a new car every film.. Whats the bloody point of the franchise without the cars with gadgets? Im actually get annoyed just writing all this.It seems to be what i like to call , the Nolan era of films! Everyone's talking and no one shooting. RIP BOND. You may as well of taken the plunge into a dark abyss with M.",2,8,18,31 December 2012
Iron Man 3," This isn't Iron man , Its SOILD CRAP
","Truly one of the biggest let downs of the year. I went to see ironman fight a bunch of bad guys , not get depression and anxiety attacks over the events that took place in The avengers film. Where all human granted , but Tony Stark is on a higher level than the rest of us. His super Intelligence really does contradict his emotions in this film. The level of action in it is so poor , i mean i timed it at 31 minutes worth of decent action and even then that wasn't to a high standard.Why is it every film i choose to see in 3D ends up being a massive let down! I hate having that feeling in the back of my head craving a reboot already , because its absurd to think this brilliant film franchise would need one. But the 3rd installment was just complete pants , it made no sense and it just baffled me how a script like this was allowed to be acted out and put onto the big screen without a second thought for the Junkies who crave to see the creations of Tony Starks work. Its exactly like seeing the new bond films remove all the gadgets and trying to turn the franchise into something its not. MATURE!I hope the Thor sequel prevails because this crap has really upset me.24 pounds 42 pence for 2 adult tickets!Refund please MR stark i know your good for it!",3,8,16,2 May 2013
Horrible Bosses," I didn't think anyone could write a decent comedy these days , I WAS WRONG
","For the first time in nearly 3 years i can finally say something that's modern and in this century has made me laugh i cant get over how amazingly blunt the jokes are in the show , and that's what i think the writers went for in this film BLUNTNESS , every joke in the film hits you like a ton of bricks there isn't one scene that didn't have me in fits of laughter it was just fantastic. Jason Bateman again showing the world he can act and telling his critics to go swivel on his middle finger by how great he was in horrible bosses.I personally rated every single actor in this film as Grade A , the acting was just superb! If you want a good laugh and a good night out go and see horrible bosses , best 8 pounds 50 I've ever spent! Oh on a side note , something totally off topic! As the film ended in the cinema i got up and went down the stairs leading out of the cinema , i looked back for my mate who was taking his time , and everyone was still sat down watching the blooper reel , when it ended everyone saw me alone at the bottom of the stairs noticed my T-SHIRT and i quote my T-SHIRT SAYS! FAT PEOPLE ARE HARD TO KIDNAP.Entire cinema laughed! :) Great day Great Film , Great Audience.",8,114,160,3 August 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," If Dobby wasn't in this movie it would of failed
","Just got back in from a viewing of the deathly hallows part one , all things considered it was a reasonably enjoyable film , but it did drag , and at times you just wanted to keel over and die from boredom , you barely see Voldemort , you barely see the fights between the Death Eaters and the other wizards , it was just a 2 hour snooze fest.But wait! Dobby makes his return and what a return it was! Possibly the best thing about this movie was dobby everyone was cheering him on , a very well scripted CGI character that warmed everyone in the theaters heart.All in all i hope part II is better if its not , they have brutally killed off a film genre of its own as well as the many young hearts who have followed it.Was nice enjoying the film with my sister though :)",6,3,6,20 November 2010
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," A clear cut message to Teenage girls.
","New moon shouldn't even be mentioned on here.The twilight saga as a hole is Sexist to women , surprised some of you dumb girls don't understand that.The books are terrible and yes I've read them and both films are even worse , they lack being original , there's nothing new that's being done with twilight that pulls itself away from other romantic films.Its full of cliché's and random plot holes.Thats me being nice by the way.Now im one of these people like i said before who's actually read the books and seen the films , and i can tell you here and now , i love every single genre of movie out there and i especially love romantic movies , but this SAGA if you will is so bad at showing what true love is it makes me want to pull my arm off just to have something to chuck at the director and author.All in all , this film is for teenage girls without a brain cell to boot.Have fun...",1,6,17,21 November 2009
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Ultron was a stand up comic
","Got back from a midnight release this morning , and i didn't want to review the film straight away as i wanted it to sink in to brain. Having said that my opinion hasn't really changed as much as i would of liked it to.Joss whedon , in a lot of ways has pretty much lied to the audience about his own film , its not overall shocking someone trying to promote the film by setting up a few custom truths , but i think the fans deserved better from him , so lets start with a few bullet points.1: Ultron in the terms of evil robots go , is up there with a more heavily depressed WALL-E , hes way way to slapstick for a super villain in this , this was supposed to be dark and tonight i saw the Disney side to things.2: Romanov is a nice character but who ever agreed with Wheadon to make her a main character or the center of attention for this blockbuster was out of their depth , giving romanov a more visual back story is fine , but the romantic element with banner and herself was again Disney's BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. Romanov would never let feelings get in the way of THE JOB.3: Hulk little to no screen time , really frustrating this having just brought my hand hulk cup ready to cheer the green bastard on to smash! I think i timed it at 20 minutes probably less! Banner spends to much time moaning about hulks destruction and not about going bananas and helping , you would think now he has some control over being the hulk and being Bruce banner he would be happy to get angry! He knew scarlet witch was messing with his brain and i know bruce is a gentle soul , but hes also smart enough o know when it wasn't his fault!4: This film wasn't set up for civil war , Thor grabbed Tony by the throat , END OF WAR... that was the only act of punishment Tony got for making , LOLtron. And he didn't have a darker side in this film , he was just a lot more impatient to get the ball rolling with protecting the earth. So that was just a big big big let down! In fact the screen time in the first movie with loki's scepter manipulating them all on the boat was more intense than this entire films disagreement with stark and loltron.5: Just another Thanos scene :/ 3 movies , 3 hints. Still no lengthily scene with Thanos in it. I was hoping for a end credit sequence with Phil or spiderman , was that was a bit of let down to.But to sum up , the film does have its good side. It wasn't a complete let down it had parts where i was laughing out loud and also had parts where the action sequences where pretty epic , it deserves no less than a 7 because a lot of work has gone into the movie to make it work and it does work , but it could of worked a lot better :/.",7,17,36,23 April 2015
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Just skip to the last 20 minutes!
","~~~~~~~~~~~~~Please note , im talking about the end of the film , do not continue reading , if you want to see the entire film~~~~~~~~~~~~Transformers 2 : Revenge of the fallen is without doubt one of the weirdest actions movie ever made , now im all for actions movies that don't make much sense , but this movie made no sense it was filled with random plot holes and really odd actions sequences that had no real relevance to the story at hand , but i sat here and i have just literally watched the entire film , overall the first 2 hours where OK , but the end was absolutely immense , the last 20 minutes was the spark the last film had , the auto-bots had hardly any dialogue in the film until the end and that's all i wanted , i wanted to see the relationship building between sam and the auto-bots , and you only actually feel that towards the end of the film , the fight between optimus and the fleet of decepticons was fantastic not to mention the great pun lines he gives them when he crushes them into a million peace's.So basically , if your thinking , well i want to watch the hole film to understand the end , don't! Just watch the last 20 minutes and it will feel not only like you haven't been cheated out of your time , but it also feels like a small episode like back in the days :)",6,0,5,26 September 2009
Fast Five," Fast And Furious , Lame and slow
","Words can not sum up just how bored i was whilst watching this today in the cinema , it was without a doubt the worst film I've seen all year , and i love the fast and furious franchise it was so boring and dull and the plot was just lame , its supposed to be about underground street racing gangs knocking off other people for money and merchandise , instead we see a bulky bald headed guy run around with his breasts out for 2 hours saying , YOU FAMILY , YOU FAMILY , the script was just poor and you see none and i mean none of the Proper racing , just when you think your about to see a kick ass drag race the director pulls to a cocky shot of them already winning the suited up car , because these guys are just to good to loose.... -.-If you ask me , and I'm surely doubting you will , this movie has absolutely nothing to do with cars or the fast and the furious , its about them trying to evade the law without cars! I thought that was the point of these films , to show us cool cars and cool stunts with cars , pulling a safe out of a wall in the middle of Rio and dragging it 15 miles isn't exactly what i call a decent insight to the films premise.Here's how i define the franchise not including this film:Nice cars , Detailed descriptions, of what make the cars good , Nice Illegal ,street races, Japanese women in skimpy skirts holding up the flags.That's all i ask out of films like this , but instead its pulled away and and attempted to try and be more sophisticated and its failed in my opinion.My sister enjoyed it , but she lacks braincells , and anyone else who enjoyed this film is short of a few themselves , i actually fell asleep a bit in the cinema my sister had to punch me awake because i was snoring.",3,15,32,22 April 2011
