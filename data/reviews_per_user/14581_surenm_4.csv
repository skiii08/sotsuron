Howl's Moving Castle," A wild and surreal trip into the mind of a master.
","I think this is possibly Miyazaki's most intriguing movie. All of his other films are very linear and even though their highly varied worlds may be visually stunning and highly creative, I feel the dreamy world of Howls Moving Castle is by far the most captivating, bizarre, and imaginative of all the worlds Miyazaki has ever envisioned.What I love about this movie is that it's highly emotional without a great deal of logic or plot or story to get in the way. In this way the film is simple, pure, and extremely beautiful. It is as if the characters go from one emotion to the next, in a world that is as random as one's own dreams. Some people have complained about the lack of plot or story or serious character development, but even though the characters are fairly static, their emotions and the physical changes they undergo as they go through these emotions brings out a higher truth that is seldom given such artistic and natural freedom.I think this is a very smart movie in many subtle ways and it's one that I look forward to watching again on the big screen and then on DVD. Although it flirts from theme to theme to theme with a kind of animated attention deficit disorder, the landscapes and utter unabated surrealism left me stunned and never bored.Also, from a quizzical character design perspective, Howl is certainly one of if not the most beautiful characters that Miyazaki has ever created. Howl is an interesting departure from Miyazaki's more classical wabi-sabi anime style that most of his heroes and heroines are drawn in as Howl is definitely a very contemporary bishonen.If you're looking for quaint settings, dynamic characters and a very involving character or plot driven story, you're not going to necessarily find them here, but you will find an equally stunning and pleasing movie if you let yourself go and enjoy this passionate, heartfelt and surreal Miyazaki dream.",10,309,353,20 March 2005
Avatar," The Future of Entertainment
","Avatar represents the future of entertainment, both production, distribution, and exhibition. When the technology moves to video games it will represent interactivity as well.As a technological and artistic movement it is rated 10/10 and is one of the most important films made in the last twenty years and is as revolutionary as Toy Story or Star Wars.Judged only on the critical literary merits of film, including plot, story, narrative, characters, subject, genre, etc. it is rated 7/10.Avatar is a very solid film and presents a message that although somewhat trite and heavy handed when presented to educated liberal minded people, is sadly needing to be brow beat again and again these days into the walnut sized dinosaur brains of the blunt skull denizens crawling around the barbaric red states.In cinematic terms: The Green Movement meets Pocahontas, The New World, Dances with Wolves, and Starcraft.One theme on the soundtrack is very reminiscent of Willow. James Horner's signature sound is audible from the very beginning.JC's love of manga and mecha is very clear, right up to then grand finale which is a really intriguing reflection of the final battle in Aliens.Sigourney Weaver ties a lot of the film together and her voice dominates every scene she is in.My only complaint is that I think JC should have done even more with the back-story and especially the science, and for a three hour film, it could have been another hour or two and I wouldn't have cared at all. It was certainly epic and the only way to see it is IMAX 3D. If you saw this film in any other format or on any other screen it would be an immediate 6/10. Bigger is better.Half the fun is the total immersion that is only accomplishable by IMAX 3D and JC's brilliant direction of every aspect of what you see, hear, and feel. As groundbreaking if not more groundbreaking than any other JC film to date. A milestone in entertainment and technology that absolutely cannot be missed.",7,1,6,21 December 2009
Gangs of New York," Big! Big! Big! Nothing...
","Sorry Martin, this wannabe 'Titanic' didn't do a thing for me...I don't want to say this is simply a film for the masses about the masses but that's the way it turned out: a big fat mass of masses for masses.That said, without spending too much time, I belive the film fails honestly because Scorcese is attached to it.If this was a film made by any unknown director or some greenhorn, I would have no choice but to applaud the effort as the EFFORT is tremendous.  But, when you look at the body of work and more importantly the intelligence and multi-level approach of Scorcese's other films, this film completely fails in comparison.Somewhere along the way this film was butchered, (pun intended) whether it was by the studio, by Scorcese, or by the batch of writers who's conflicting visions and machismo keep bobbing up and down throughout the story.  I believe Scorcese (or the studio) tried too hard to make a film for 'today's (young) audience' instead of just making (or letting Scorcese make) a Scorcese film.  Sure, perhaps many of today's brainwashed and dumbed down proles might not get it, but the film would have entertained the large following this director has cultivated over his many years behind the camera.  If the only story he wanted to tell was a nobody wins revenge tale without redemption, flanked by an extremely shallow and cookie-cutter romance, then why waste all the time and money with 1860's New York? Whether or not Martin is actually washed up or still possesses his own magical abilities with a camera I cannot say, but it seems that whatever his original vision was, someone went through it (violently) with a cleaver.It's interesting though, as a comparison, the actual base human story of 'Titanic' has the same cookie-cutter romance elements as 'Gangs'  yet it is crystal clear that the FOCUS of 'Titanic' is on an IMMACULATE portrayal of both the ship itself, the passengers, and the events that took place -- an accurate portrayal of history is the most important factor.  'Gangs' does not present that same sharp and exacting historical focus to any degree, instead bits of chopped up pseudo history and gruesome violence are thrown around for a bit color in an otherwise monochromatic, by the books, and boring love story.Bottom line: I can hear this bomb falling right now...  Half my theatre left after the 2 hour mark, some before, and that was on opening night.",1,41,79,21 December 2002
Donnie Darko," Actually, it's not that dark...
","This film is simply too highly rated because people are trying to take it apart and make 1000 meanings out of a story filled with meaningless McGuffins and Red Herrings.  If you want to understand the film as a film made by a man, have a look at this explanation for some insight into DD...*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*I went to USC Film School so I can comment with some credibility on production students like Kelly.  Take a quick look at this and you can see how USC production film student psychology explains much of DD that is a mystery to the rest of the world.  First, read Richard Kelly's brief little bio and personal quotes on his IMDB page.  Then, think about this: USC production students, especially those that spend $60,000 on a grad film that is a monstrosity of sci-fi and camp and mad scientists and teleporters are people who are trying to make 100 different films inside the scope of one big short film, DD is exactly this kind of thing: a glorified big short film.  It is always a goal of every production student to one-up your colleagues and friends and to make a better 'film to end all films' - whether it be on the student or USC graduate level.  If you take this philosophy of filmmaking and place it on a film like DD it starts to make a lot of sense.For instance, Donnie Darko is not about time travel, it is not about God, it is not about philosophy, it is not about love, it is not about Frank, Gretchen, Cunningham, Grandma Death, small towns, suburbs, Chinese girls, Sparkle Motion, violence, bunnies, channels, gym teachers, portals, choices, mental illness, Drew Barrymore, or anything else for that matter.  And last but not least it is certainly not about Donnie Darko.  It IS about Richard Kelly imposing 1000 different ideas, which, each in their own right, are intriguing and might make an interesting short or perhaps a feature.  But when you put them all together into an under 2 hour film like DD you end up with a real mess, a very entertaining roller coaster mystery mess that keeps you guessing, but still a big mess.  I saw Darko in the theater when it came out and it was fantastic and I was really freaked out, I also enjoyed Star Wars Episode 1 IN THE THEATER.  Then I saw Donnie Darko again on HBO two years later and the writing on the wall was clear: it wasn't about anything I had previously tried to rack my brain thinking it was about.  It is just a collection of McGuffins that serve no purpose other than loosely tying ideas, characters, and scenes together using more Red Herrings than a Hitchcock film, the whole film itself is a Red Herring, it is a film that was made because a film based on that material and those ideas could be made and entertain an audience, and Drew Barrymore would get a part.People like to say this is an example of a 'non Hollywood crap movie' but in the end it IS just another Hollywood movie, it is simply a compilation of a bunch of sci-fi B.S. that makes no sense on purpose, some religious wondering, and some overly emotional human responses to life, all thrown together in a blender and put together in an 'Indy' style.
My advice, if you see a movie in the theater and you think it is the greatest film even made, see it again on the small box at home, if it is AS GOOD OR BETTER, then it's a great film, but if it falls apart big time (Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace anyone?) then you'll know you're really seen the film for what it truly is.",8,0,0,1 August 2003
