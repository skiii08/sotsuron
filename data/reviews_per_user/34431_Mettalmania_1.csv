Hereditary," Sigh
","The hype isn't real. This movie is a yawnfest. I heard som many good things and was looking forward to friday night scare-time, but instead was served this sorry excuse for a horror-flick. About an hour into the movie, nothing had still happened! I really wanted to end my misery but as a movie-fanatic, I take pride in finishing movies. Just take my word for it, this one aint worth it!!",1,1,3,2 November 2018
