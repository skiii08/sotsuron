","'You might laugh yourself sick, but you may not respect yourself in the morning'(MSN.com). This quote regarding the movie is so true!! I laughed my ass off half the movie, but i also gasped about the same amount of time. I mean being a 20 year old i guess the raunchy humor would make any college student laugh hysterically, however any intelligent person may also regroup for a second and realize that what they were laughing at is in some way offending themselves. I mean while some of the anti-semitic remarks and scenes were humorous, i was also quite offended by some of them being Jewish myself. I mean idc if Cohen is Jewish, it's still pretty offensive. I'm kind of disappointed at myself for laughing at anti-semitic jokes. I mean i can't lie, i liked the movie to a point. I mean stupid teenage boys probably loved all the stupid nudity and wrestling and perversion, but in my opinion in was disgusting and unnecessary. It was like watching Jackass or some other stupid reality TV show. Again, overall this movie is hysterical, but it really makes you rethink your own beliefs and possibly even regret laughing at things that are actually offending you. It actually makes the audience full of jews, anti-semites, evangelists, southerners, etc. look like idiots because it's like they're actually laughing at jokes directed to offend them.",7,3,9,3 November 2006
