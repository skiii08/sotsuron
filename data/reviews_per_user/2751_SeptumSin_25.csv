Lucky Number Slevin," This is what 'The Usual Suspects' and 'Pulp Fiction' should have been
",Kay well Slevin is having a very very bad day. He goes down on his luck and eventually is pulled into a gang war that he isn't even supposed to be remotely involved in. To top that a very high profile assassin is involved. What will happen to our hero? Will his bad luck last forever? I like thing simple at times but then again there are times when a movie's complexity impresses me. This is a movie that has a very complex plot and nothing is as it seems. The acting is very nice and it is always nice to see some of the big names like Morgan Freeman and Bruce Willis strut their stuff in this film. If you are really into the action I apologize as it is mostly talk and speculation but still it is a very good movie and there are still plenty of bodies that pile up. If you would like a clever movie then this would be a good one to see.,7,1,6,23 December 2008
Akira," Fast & Furious
",This is one of the ground breaking anime in America. This movie is pretty much what started the Anime craze as we know it. This movie is about a group of bikers that stumble upon a government experiment. The voice acting is very good both in Japanese and English. I typically find Japanese voices grating but this was very good when it comes to the interactions between characters. Now the big question is 'why 5 of 10?' Well I do find that the story though interesting ends too quickly and the ending it self is quite disturbing (Sorry can't explain in detail due to harm of spoilers). Anyone that is into anime should @ least rent this movie. The movie does have some defining features and plenty of action just try not to keep high expectations that this movie has garnered and it will be an enjoyable experience.,5,6,10,31 January 2006
Shaun of the Dead," whooo
","Well now her's a bit of a little comedy Well let's start with Shaun a typical guy with a dead end life and an idiot friend dragging him down. He's having problems with his friends, family, job and love life. So how can we fix this? Have a zombie Holocaust. It truly is the best way to sort out your life.Well really and truly this movie is quite funny but it takes a few watches in order to really get it fully. At first the movie appears to be more horror but as you watch it again you notice more and more of the comedy edge through. It truly is one of the more interesting comedies I've seen and for that it deserves good props. Though outdone in comedy by Hot Fuzz it truly is a well done film worth multiple watches.",8,0,2,30 November 2008
Alexander," Not as bad as one would have you believe
","I don't know why so many rated this movie so bad but I shall continue with my honest take on this film.Kay, this is the story of Alexander the great as interpreted by Oliver Stone. Well we have our hero seen growing up instilled with the lovely values of conquest instilled by his barbaric father and witchy mother. Well after growing up he went right through to the conquest for himself working on taking over most of Europe surpassing the travels of the gods and heroes themselves into lands previously unknown. Things eventually catch up to Alexander and well I'll try and save the rest for your viewing pleasure.One of the issues in this film that I believe is responsible for some of the negativity relates to the whole gay sex angle. Well Oliver Stone wished to work on a historical statement basically saying that the people back then wern't as homophobic as we are now. He may have gone over the top but I don't think it was as overboard as everyone said it was. I didn't leave the film thinking 'ooh gay sex film'. I mean shoot people loved Brokeback Mountain and that showed way more in terms of gay relations than this film. Of course those of you who are major history buffs will not get to enjoy an exact history experience but I've learned since watching the Disney Version of Pocahontas that really a movie can be enjoyed without full historical accuracy.If you like movies like Braveheart or Gladiator you will very much enjoy this film.",7,0,1,30 November 2008
Home Alone," A Christmas Classic You should give a chance
",This is a really good family film so long as you can get through the slapstick.Home alone is pretty much as it says. A family decides to go to Paris for the holidays. Unfortunately in their rush they left one small thing behind...their youngest son. Now he not only must take on the task of managing the house but he also needs to outwit some burglars before they take over. Will he get through the holidays alive? This movie is kind of looked at as a simple slapstick movie but in truth all of the slapstick is pretty much in the last 10 minutes of the movie. The rest of the movie is a pretty nice and touching Christmas tale that covers the areas of family and togetherness. The acting is fairly decent in this film and the characters are pretty likable. The music is very well done and the setting really gives you the feel of a true Christmas classic. If you haven't watched this film yet then definitely check it out.,8,1,2,7 December 2008
The Polar Express," Believe!
",This movie stars a little boy that has difficulty in believing in the Christmas. Then he is confronted with issues that give him a chance to truly seek out and test these beliefs. Will he find joy in the Christmas spirit? I really think this movie is a beauty and I definitely understand why it is shown in IMAX so many times. This movie really needs to be seen in IMAX to truly get the full enjoyment. I really enjoy this film but it took me a few times to really get into it. Tom Hanks ends up playing like 10 characters throughout the film and the acting is very good. I believe that you will enjoy this film this year if you get a chance to see it.,7,0,2,23 December 2008
Die Hard 2," Pretty good but more of the same
",Well here we go again...Die Hard 2 is pretty much the first movie but set in an Airport. If you love the crawling through air ducts the gun fights and the funny quips of our favorite hero then here we go. John McClane is a very unlucky man during the holidays as when he is just about to meet his wife at the airport terrorists attack and yet again he is pitted against an evil genius in a no holds barred action fun film.So with all things considered it is a fun movie and really and truly if you liked the first movie then you will like the second. If the movie wasn't practically the same thing as the first movie I'd give it a higher rating. You ever wonder why the guy never runs out of clips? The Action is a bit heavier than the first movie and things are slightly more intense so it can be said that this movie is pretty good but it does sacrifice a bit of the acting.In the end another action fun film for the holidays but if you are planning on flying anywhere this film isn't recommended.,7,0,2,1 December 2008
Alien vs. Predator," Something that is fund to watch but not your high quality stuff...
",Out of the Sci-Fi pictures today there are few that are quite as memorable as the Predator and the Aliens. When they go head to head this seems like it would be a match made in heaven...well it was an interesting fight to be sure.Introducting in the red corner the Aliens a race of multiplying killers with little in mind other than laying their eggs in your chest and watching the gore start to pour out. In the Blue Corner we have the Preditors a race of hunters that take their work very seriously with high tech weaponry that would make Robocop seem tame. But oddly enough we have another group of fighters in the fray the human targets! Ever the victims of these two warrior races.I wonder why it seems always necessary to throw in a few token humans to kill. This movie would have been just as enjoyable (If not less disturbing) with just the Aliens and the Predator. These humans are a bunch of explorers trying to unearth an ancient temple of some sort which has them end up in the middle of a fight between two nasty sci-fi critters that don't care what gets in their way.The effects on this movie and the combat scenes are very good and exciting to watch but the plot is cheesy and any person expecting anything really good from this (though I can't say why) will be disappointed. But if you like combat and gore then this is a good movie to watch. My suggestion though is to rent this one first.,5,0,1,5 March 2006
Across the Universe," A truly inspiring picture
","This one got upgraded after my last viewing...There are a few films in a lifetime that can bring true emotion into the forefront and plater it to the screen, Across the Universe is one of those movies.The Movie Stars a young artist named Jude as he traveled to 60's USA. They come into contact w/ issues such as the war, race riots and other things as their very friendships come to difficulty. The movie is a musical using various Beatles songs in order to get the point across.The actors are mainly fresh faces and yet the acting and singing was done really well. I am usually very critical of actors trying to sing in a film I remember how sickened I was by Moulan Rouge which I still say is a terrible movie due to the low quality of the singing. These actors are very good at singing and the people in charge are not star stunned.When I first watched this film I went to theaters as I figured by the commercials it would be an entertaining drug ride, and indeed it was. What I wasn't expecting was a deep story that was very well put together and imaginative. The songs for the most part are executed very well and the imagery is very much stunning. This is one of the first films in a long time that had my attention fully from start to finish.Due to fears of spoilers I won't say anything more about the film. If you can you should definitely check this film out with an open mind. It isn't just some sixties drug trip romance...",10,2,4,13 November 2008
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," not as bad as I would have thought
",I've been avoiding this movie like it was Catwoman and many of the things I've read about it reminds me of the fact. In truth however this isn't near as bad as I've heard. Maybe the whole thing about low expectations...The movie starts out with the group right where they left off in the first movie and how they are starting to fight with each other's values as some are trying to settle down while others are heating things up. Meanwhile a planet destroying fiend is making his way towards the earth and an old villain shows up to try and shake things up.This movie was predictable and it was indeed a fairly brainless action film. Many of the points made were not bad when it comes to comic book movies and it was enjoyable to watch. The battles were fun and even if the other characters don't fit their old school comic book character types the main four have the chemistry down right. Over all if you get a shot at this in the $5 bin I say go for it you'll have a liitle fun.,6,2,4,16 September 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Truly the real Best Picture of 2008!
",Brad Pitt in a role that is a real inspiration to all in this tale of self exploration and true drama.Benjamin was a strange case as he was a child born with an odd condition that left him aging differently than other people in the world. Growing up with others dying around him he managed to gain a unique view of the world in light of his condition.This film pretty much is a remake of Forest Gump in most aspects which is one of the reasons that this one has an 8 instead of a 9. This tale shows many adventures of our hero over his lifetime and Brad Pitt's portrayal of this character rivals Tom Hanks in his portrayal of a similar character type. With him and his counterpart Cate Blanchett they get along well together making the interactions very smooth and enjoyable overall.In the end the message of enjoy life in the moment gets across well and this movie is very much one of the more enjoyable films of that year.,8,1,2,27 December 2009
The Nightmare Before Christmas," A whimsical musical that puts the 'spirit' in Christmas
","Halloween Town continues to produce the scariest of holidays to their leader Jack Skelington there is something missing, until he stumbles upon the cool world of Christmas where he realizes that this is the time to try out for a change. Will things work out for Jack or will it all lead to disaster? This film is very strange and hard to forget. The animation is very creepy much like Tim Burton himself in many things. It is one truly unique musical that should be seen by everyone at least once. The characters are well acted and this is probably one of the best of Tim Burton's films. Most of Tim Burton's work is of course creepy and such but most of it seems kind of sterile without emotions. Here that quality is not as pronounced and this makes the film far more interesting overall. If you see any of Tim Burton's works then this is the one.",8,1,2,16 December 2008
A Bug's Life," Good but keep an eye out for better
",Well now as I'm cycling once again alphabetically through my movies I come through to one of the first Pixar flix in my collection 'a bug's life' Well I not only watched the movie but this time I went through all of the special features as to not miss a thing. Seeing as this is the movie that came after the Toy Story movies I must say that they have come a ways with the technology...or at least I realized this once I watched the special features on the disc that told me so and pointed out all the little things that I didn't realize before like all the leaves moving and the different shadows and the hair on each bug's back....Really and truly this is Pixar and I don't feel that the animation quality should be the major judging point on this film as that is sure to be top notch. The story is where things really need to come into play. Well This story follows an ant that isn't quite getting along with the other antz in that conformist thing that they like to do. (Also seen in the plot from the movie Antz which now that I think about it is kind of creepy with both films coming out so close together) Anycase our hero ant has to save the colony that treats him like trash against evil bully insects that are out to extort them for food. This adventure brings up a cast of colorful and friendly characters that have many comic moments throughout the film.Overall the story is about working together to accomplish something that couldn't have been accomplished alone. Good lesson overall but still not extremely high class.In the end if you strip away the technological glitter A Bug's life is a charming little family movie with a plot that is entertaining but nothing highly innovative. Still worth a watch and if you are a fan of Pixar like I am you won't be ashamed of having it in your collection though I feel it is the weakest of the Pixar titles.Best wishes hope you enjoy the film.,6,0,1,10 November 2008
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," here we are again
","Well Here we go again...Well our favorite family is once again on a vacation this time to sunny Florida. They get everything together but seem to lose their son yet again and this time in New York. Again he has to survive alone and must work up the nerve to confront the criminals he so enjoyed humiliating last time.Well this time we have pretty much the same thing in a much broader environment. The New York setting makes the movie seem a little fresher than just having everything over again but at the same time they decided to beef up on the whole slapstick portion making the movie much more of a slapstick film than the first one. The music and characterization of the other actors is still fairly good and the movie still has a nice warm Christmas film. This one, however, still leaves you feeling like you're watching a warner brothers film and after seeing this one you really don't want to see any more. Thus we end the Home alone experience. At least as far as I'm concerned. Enjoy this hit but be sure to watch it during the holidays, otherwise I'd only watch it if you enjoy the roadrunner cartoons.",6,0,2,7 December 2008
A Beautiful Mind," A little rant on a great movie
",What can I say I like movies about Mental Health. This movie is about Professor John Nash who currently teaches mathematics @ Princton University. This man is one of the greatest minds in the world even winning the Nobel prize for his efforts.So what separates this story from any other boring biography piece? Well that would be the fact that Dr. Nash has a Mental Health Disability. Now I'm not going to ruin things for you if you want to see the movie but I will say this...it is really well done. Ron Howard engineered the film in such a way to keep you guessing even when you feel you have a handle on things. Russell Crowe definitely gave the best performance of his life here. I still have a hard time believing that he gave the performance in the film. Jennifer Connelly also gives a good performance winning her the Best Supporting Actress Oscar. In the end I have to say there is little wrong with this movie....From a Mental Health Therapist point of view I still have some hesitance in showing it to the population I treat as the tendency to glamorize things and even seems to point of even saying that the man managed to beat things by taking care of himself and not accepting treatment where the book shows the opposite effect. I do try and point out that the man still takes medications to this day. Either way there is no better illustration of mental illness in my eye so if you haven't seen this film then you really should.,9,1,3,9 November 2008
Die Hard," A True Classic
","Now there are many action films out there but ther5e are few that hold the classic nature of the first Die Hard Movie.This movie stars John McClane, a New York Cop trying to win back his wife over the Christmas holidays in LA. Unfortunately this conflicts with the plans of terrorists that are out to make his life a living hell.This movie is a true classic with a lot of action and a lot of cool catch phrases that are easily recognized today. Aan Rickman is almost always good in anything he acts in and his portrayal of the terrorist leader Hans Gruber is very fun. Bruce Willis is of course hard to forget with his own brand of humor it makes this particular movie quite enjoyable and more than just any other action movie. The plot isn't anything new but the concept at the time was so props given to this.If anything this holiday season check out Die Hard if you haven't if you like action then you won't be disappointed.",8,1,3,1 December 2008
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Boom!
",Ah yet another wonderful action movie for the Christmas season...John McClane is having a really bad day. He wakes up on the floor with a hangover and now he's forced to follow the whims of a psycho terrorist with a grudge. So he gets to drive all over new york with his new friend Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson) and have a good ol time with plenty of explosions! BOOM! I would think this best describes this movie. They definitely have tried their best to be innovative here by moving away from the basics which sadly I felt was a mistake as this makes the die hard movie pretty much just another action movie and takes away the formula that sets it apart from many other action types. I would say that this movie is a little bit fun and I do definitely enjoy the interaction between Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson. The two actors do a good job playing off of one another and make the movie much more fun to watch. All the showy explosions and car chases really are more boring than entertaining these days. All in all this movie is better than average but not a cut above by any means. If you wish to complete your look at the Die Hard Series then by all means watch this film.,6,0,0,3 December 2008
WALL·E," Truly a great film
",I really think that Pixar is the home of true quality films and this is definitely one of them.Wall-E is a robot that is left on earth to clean it up while the people on planet are away. So he and his pet roach work hard everyday until they have a new arrival that turns everything on end and sends Wall-E on the Adventure of his life.Like all the Pixar films this is a very beautiful picture. The acting is very good as most of it in the beginning is very limited and it is amazing that a world of emotion can be put into one or two words. The Plot is very enjoyable and the movie is well suited for people of all ages. If you want a good time you should definitely watch this film it is very much re-watchable.,9,1,4,4 January 2009
The Terminal," America is Closed!
","This movie stars a fellow that came in from his country to see the United States. Unfortunately for him his country had a coup and he no longer has the authority to go into the United States but he no longer has the authority to go back either. So now he must strive to survive in the terminal but with forces working against him will he ever get to live out his dream to see New York City? Will he ever be allowed to go home? We shall see...This movie is a very imaginative and funny comedy and is very much a feather in Tom Hank's Cap. His acting job was very much suited for this film and though many critics say that it was over the top I believe that he was quite convincing in his portrayal. I really enjoyed the chemistry between the actors and the film was very smooth and easy to follow. The only problem with this is that the end could have been better, but I'll let you sort that out. If you wish to see a good comedy then this is one of the things that should be on your list to watch.",8,0,1,27 December 2008
Raging Bull," It is amazing what an additional viewing will do
",Well let me start by saying that all movies that I review have to be watched twice before I feel I can give them a proper review. Many movies go up and down in rating with a second viewing and sometimes one doesn't quite catch the point with that first view.This is definitely the case for the movie Raging Bull. In short it is the story of a boxer and his rise to the top of the championship world as well as his inevitable fall from grace.When I first saw this movie I said 'Ah Robert Dinero and Joe Pessie playing the wise guys again' and kind of just let the move flow by. I felt bored by it. So my initial thought was 'What's the big deal?' The second viewing was hard for me as I have a considerable amount of films to watch but I pulled myself back to it and was very pleasantly surprised. Dinero works well with the part that he was given and truly pored himself into the role. Though the actors were not really going outside the box for their acting the intensity was very top notch. The movie ia a long one but you can get engrossed into the storyline. Shot in black and white it lends an element of age to the film that also gives it an extra plus in the art department.On the downside the movie can get away from you and leave you with that bored feeling if you arn't working to pay attention. I also have a hard time watching the anger on the screen that Dinero is so good at.In the end this is a movie that is worth it so long as you make sure to have the energy to go into it. If you work with this film you will definitely not be disappointed.,8,1,2,29 August 2010
Iron Man," Truly a Blockbuster
","Man! I don't believe it's too overrated but still...OK we start the movie with Tony Stark, a multimillionaire playboy, alcoholic, weapon making genius. He's not carrying what happens until something comes about that changes his mind and makes him make a super suite to combat world terror. Thus Iron Man was born.This is yet another great action film with predictable plot and a big fight at the end. Comic book fans will like this movie as it is fairly accurate to the story of Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent with the part of Tony Stark I doubt it could have been played better. The only downer of this movie is the fact that it's still just another blockbuster with predictable plot but I'm fine for more of the same but it won't get above an 8 no matter how cool it looks or is acted out.",8,2,3,30 November 2008
Tombstone," A pretty good western from more recent times
","Ah the old west...we always romanticize about its wonders with all the sex alcohol and murder going on but we somehow make it though having it look like something out of a black and white Disney fairy tale. In more recent years the westerns have been darker in nature especially so after the Clint Eastwood era. Tombstone is somewhere in the middle of all of this.Well we are welling the story of Wyatt Eart and Doc holiday taking on the outlaws of the OK Corral. We have all the things that make our western's fun such as the violence and the drinking and the sex (well more implied). It also tends to have the oddly clean feeling that we got in the other old day westerns were most of the heroes cleaned their suits regularly and not like the Clint Eastwood type westerns where everything is covered by a level of dirt.The acting was very well done though I really wasn't' that impressed by Kurt Russels performance it like his character was more wooden than the others. Of course he was probably overshadowed by Val Kilmers spectacular performance of Doc Holiday, only Robert Downey Jr. Could have played the character better.The movie is easily watchable and though it clocks a little over 2 hours in length we can forgive it as you are entertained most of the time. The action is good but not overwhelming so you tend to not get bored easily.Is you are a fan of the old style westerns or like a little more gutsiness behind it this is a good movie to enjoy.",7,0,1,16 September 2010
Beowulf," Good old fashioned animated violence
","Well another of those have to see films, Beowulf is a computer animated film based on the tales of the last days of Beowulf. The story follows Beowulf as he comes through and slays monsters takes on kingdoms and enjoys the spoils...In the end I had a little trouble taking this movie seriously. Even though they try to dress it up with a whole lot of blood (and I do mean a lot) and violence I have a hard time taking this seriously. I don't really understand why as I keep fighting against the whole 'hard to take animated films serious' but I kept picturing shrek for some reason. I do feel that they tried a little too hard to make the movie more raunchy. Still in the end it is a good die hard action film and has subject matter that is enjoyable to most fantasy buffs...me included.Anycase this is a good movie that many fans of fantasy violence can enjoy.",6,0,0,11 September 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Really...?!
",Kay here is another film that is strangely different from the typical...or maybe not Can we say Action Film? Yup this movie is definitely an action title. Well we have our newest Die Hard film in New York with our favorite hero having to protect a computer geek with the fate of the world in the balance. Only Bruce Willis and his geeky sidekick can take on the evil computer terrorists before they do their nasty terror thing.OK this movie is waaay over the top. I mean like cars flipping through the air and ramming into helicopters and the many many explosions and gun fights. All that being said many of the complaints friends have made is 'I'm computer savvy and it is impossible to do any of the stuff in the movie with computers like they say'. Well I'm not computer savvy so I can believe it to be possible and that allowed me to enjoy the movie. Wizard magazine said it best in a letter written complaining about why spiderman's glove never gets stuck to his webbing when he shoots it. 'Suspend your disbelief!' I mean you were willing to suspend that disbelief for all the near escapes all the times the enemy comes back from attacks that would kill normal people and you're gonna complain about a little inaccuracy about what people can do with computers? This movie is a fun action film but it is a fairly good addition to the Die Hard series much in the spirit of the previous films. Live on Die Hard!,6,1,2,30 November 2008
Aladdin," A true Disney classic
",Well now back in the early ninties Disney released the classic retelling of Alladin and the Genie from the classic stories told long ago about a man finding a magic lamp with an even more magical genie that will grant his master anything that he chooses.This adaptation was really well done and I must give Disney props for actually taking the male hero in the tale and making him into something more than a two dimensional prince character. The songs are enjoyable and the voice acting is very good. Robin Williams excels and the Genie and truly is the biggest of the stars in this film. The other voices are well done and fairly well memorable and the movie itself is a great enjoyable fun.If you are wanting to make a Disney Collection the one is not complete without this film.,8,1,1,25 November 2008
