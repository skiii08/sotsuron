The Blair Witch Project," Overhyped and not that great
","Whilst this film is unquestionably scary and convincingly acted, it lacks any substance and is very uncomfortably cut off at the end.  Nothing is done to bring the viewer 'back down' afterwards, and this left me feeling that I'd been used...  The cinematography was appalling, with continuously shaking pictures that left me feeling utterly nauseous throughout the film, and well after it ended.  I'll be watching for the convincing actors in future films, but equally I'll be watching out for films directed and written by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez in the future, and consciously avoiding them.",1,0,2,14 August 1999
The Fifth Element," Clich√©d, predictable, and verging on plagiarism
","...how on *earth* did this rubbish get nominated for an Oscar? Don't waste your time on The Fifth Element, just watch the movies it steals every single idea and plot-line from. Take a liberal dose of Blade Runner, throw in a splash of Brazil, a good shake of Star Wars, salt with some Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and top off with an oh-so-trite James Bond ending.A complete and utter waste of time, and Tucker's character has to be one of the most annoying in cinematic history - and is also one of the most blatant of the plagiaristic ripoffs in the movie, being an almost exact copy of the character Max Quordlepleen from the Hitchhiker's book 'Restaurant at the End of the Universe'.Truly shameful.",4,12,26,7 September 2006
Being John Malkovich," Utter drivel
","Slow, boring, nonsensical and self-indulgent, this must be amongst the most over-rated films of all time. At the end of the day, this is a film which it is fashionable to rate well, and pretend that it meant something to you - and hence you must yourself be as clever as this film desperately tries to be. Unfortunately it fails. 'Being John Malkovich' isn't clever, it is contrived.",2,4,9,15 December 2002
Now You See Me," Incredibly contrived, lazy script wastes the acting talent
","Now You See Me starts off promisingly, but sadly spirals downhill very quickly. Nonsensical 'magic trick' after nonsensical 'magic trick' goes completely unexplained, and save for one minor trick near the start of the movie, the explanations behind those few for which explanations are attempted become more and more nonsensical. Few films ask you to suspend disbelief to this degree, and the rare few which do are universally terrible.There is a great cast in this movie, and although the CGI is often mediocre, the cinematography is of the standard you'd expect from a mainstream Hollywood film. And yet, all is wasted because of a plot with gaping holes in it, the size of the Holland Tunnel. No attempt is made to fill them in, either. You watch scene after scene, asking yourself why you're even continuing, and hoping above hope that all will resolve itself in the end.It doesn't. The ending is even more childish and ham-fisted than the rest of the movie. Now You See Me is a staggering disappointment, and it all comes down to one of the weakest scripts in recent memory.What a shame.",5,9,15,19 September 2013
Pearl Harbor," Great fantasy, lousy history...
","As a work of complete fiction, Pearl Harbor works quite well.  The plot is fairly interesting, albeit with a fairly slow and drawn-out start to the love story. The special effects are truly stunning - they're believable and there are a lot of them.  The problem is, Pearl Harbor isn't supposed to be a work of complete fiction - it is supposed to be a history of a real event, interwoven with a fictional love story.It is here that Pearl Harbor fails, in the worst possible way.  The retelling of Pearl Harbor is one-sided, one-dimensional and hence utterly false.  This robs the film of its purpose, and for me destroyed any emotional impact of either the historical or the emotional/fictional aspects it entails.Probably the worst thing with this film is the intense racism it contains. From start to finish, the Japanese are portrayed as hateful, thoughtless robots with the exception of one character who's portrayed as doubt-filled - but only because he believes the attack may not benefit Japan.  Of course, the American side is depicted as heroes and heroines every one...A few examples of this disparity: pretty much without exception, every single Japanese character in the film has a grimace, scowl, or look of death on his face; Americans are given all of the 'good' emotions (laughter, happiness, sadness, fear, etc. - but never hatred). Whenever an American dies, we're treated to a display of the humanity of the dying character; whenever a Japanese person dies, we see little if anything. (For example, only once do we see a Japanese pilot when his plane is shot down. He falls from the plane but the camera ignores him - he is, after all, only Japanese, not human). Americans only shoot planes and bomb buildings; people aren't 'involved'.  Japanese are depicted as shooting at people instead of the planes they're standing next to; at drowning sailors instead of the ships they're drowning alongside. The whole film is set alongside US flags, US children playing, even Santa Claus gets an appearance. The only thing missing is the apple pie... The Japanese people, by contrast, make only two tiny appearances - some kids playing with a kite in the background of one scene, and a Japanese lady walking in the grounds of a house in another.I've never been tempted to walk out mid-film before.  I was strongly tempted with Pearl Harbor, but didn't because I felt I shouldn't judge the film without seeing the whole thing.  Now I've seen it, I find the result to be a very, very poor retelling of a historic event.  See it as a work of fiction, or don't see it at all!",3,0,0,29 May 2001
The Transporter," ...and then it all fell apart!
","The Transporter seemed like a good, solid movie for about 95% of its running time.  To be sure, this is a movie where you must surrender disbelief before you walk into the cinema, in the genre of films like the Die Hard series and many modern Asian martial arts movies. Facts don't get in the way of a good story, and in a good story such lapses can be easily forgiven. This is sadly not one of those films, though.  I can only presume that the budget ran out, and deadlines did their damage, because after what seemed promising through almost the entire movie quickly turned into a shambles with one of the weakest endings I have ever seen.  I won't spoil what happens, although the ending could hardly be any more spoiled if I tried - suffice to say that you will leave the cinema thoroughly disappointed, and perhaps even tempted to try for a refund.As the film progressed, I'd been expecting to want to buy it on DVD if only for some funny scenes, alongside its impressive special effects and fight scenes (which borrow heavily from the movies of Jackie Chan in places).  As I left the cinema, though, it was with the knowledge that even if I received this film on DVD free, I'd sell it to get something better with the money. That would not be a difficult proposition.",4,0,0,15 October 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," Beautiful but empty
","The five-word summary: Visually spectacular self-indulgent claptrap. I understand that the book is very good, but standing by itself this movie is absolutely and utterly meaningless.  The entire 'plot', such as it is, could be described in six sentences or less. The visual imagery is stunning, but towards the end gets extremely repetitive. The music is beautiful, but the sound-effects are absolutely diabolical - at points it seems as if there are less than ten separate sound effects used in the entire movie, repeated ad-nauseum.It defies belief that this movie is so well-rated on IMDB.  I can only draw two conclusions - either the book is great, and people are willing to forgive the fact that this movie cannot stand in its own right for anybody who's not read the book first, or people vote this movie up because they want to feel clever and believe they found some hidden meaning in a movie that basically has none.",2,11,21,5 September 2003
Signs," How can the creator of Sixth Sense make a movie this bad?
","This is the second Shyamalan movie I've seen, after Sixth Sense.  That was a good movie - this isn't.  The two movies are literally the exact opposite of each other. Where Sixth Sense is clever, unpredictable and intense, Signs is patronising, condescending, thoroughly predictable and painfully slow.Realistically, the plot of this movie should have consumed no more than about ten minutes, and was padded out with scenes that wanted so badly to be suspenseful - but weren't.  That was probably partly to do with the weak plot, but equally to do with the laughably bad special effects, that belonged in a 1970s movie.I wanted so well to like this after being so impressed with Shyamalan's past work.  I couldn't like it, because it was a mediocre, wishy-washy movie made even worse by the hype that preceded it.Don't waste your time - any B movie running on cable for free is likely to be as good, if not better.",4,1,1,30 May 2003
The Deer Hunter," Possibly one of the most over-rated movies of all time
","The Deer Hunter claims to be a film about war, and to believe the hype you might think it was a good one.  It is, unfortunately, neither.  The film consists of a series of disconnected, almost unrelated scenes - you're never given the time to form any emotional attachment to the characters.  Huge swathes of time where this could happen - time that would be the meat of any good movie - is completely skipped in what seems to be an attempt to prevent that bond from forming.Without emotional attachment, the film is boring, trite and cliched.  An obsession with a Russian Roulette theme doesn't make a good movie, and that (apart from some fair acting when dealing with the truly terrible script) is about all the Deer Hunter has. The real question here is how this movie has appeared in the IMDB Top 100 movies (99th at the time of this writing) when it doesn't have a coherent plot, has only average acting and really has no story to tell.There are many much, MUCH better war movies out there.  Give this one a pass, and try any of the others - whatever you choose, it is bound to be an improvement.",2,21,40,1 February 2002
