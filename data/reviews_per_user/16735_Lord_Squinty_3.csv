The Blair Witch Project," My all time Worst Film EVER award (and thats going some)
","So bad I don't know where to start.. My worst film ever - and I've owned over 1,000 films in my lifetime - including gems such as Megashark Vs Giant Octopus. (Which I'd rather watch again than this...)I'll go for the short version as it's so old now.If you want to watch a scared girl in the dark in a ten - take your wife / GF camping and hit the outside of the tent. Exactly the same as what this film is.Even my younger sister (for reference is now in her 30's and is still scared by the flying monkeys from Wizard of Oz, laughed this film off).A good advert for the power of marketing over content, but nothing else.",1,19,36,13 August 2010
The Usual Suspects," My Favourite movie of all time!
","This is quite simply my favourite movie ever. Why? Because it gets better every time you see it...SPOILERS!!!!!You watch it the first time and go 'OOhhh, oH! He's Kayser!'Then you watch a second time - I heard it best from Bryan Singer (possibly on DVD interview) First time you see Kevin Spacey in the police station - he looks bored. Second time you see Kevin Spacey in police station - you see him examining the bulletin board. Same performance, different point of view.I must have watched this film 20+ times now, and still try to figure out exactly what went on - I now think I'll never know. Because Kevin Spacey is telling the story - it could ALL be lies, but some of it MUST be true (eg The body being found on the beach - is it as he says or some other guy he's offed and uses this story to cover up?I've just read the lowest reviews of this film, and Wow..., Just... Wow. Comparing this to Scream is like comparing Sherlock Holmes to CSI. They both solve crimes right? No. And I think these people are doing this film a grave disservice or are a bit miffed that they didn't guess the end. I guessed Screams killers no problem, the fact that she got chased up the stairs and then instantly attacked in the upstairs room gave away the fact there's 2 killers.. from then on its easy elimination. (my dear watson =) ) This is a completely different game than scream - its not even in the same ballpark as scream as far as films go. (I like Scream BTW) Its like comparing Scream to Goodfellas. Totally different films and genres. As for the guy that thought that this film was rubbish because 80% wasn't exactly as you saw on screen, but thought fight Club was, well .... Maybe you should watch fight club again, and try to stay awake for the ending this time eh?END SPOILERS!This is one of the few films that gets better every time you watch it. Watch it once and you will think you know what you watched. Watch it twice (or more) and you will realise you didn't see what you thought you did...Classic (and highly under-rated!)Squinty",10,1,1,13 August 2010
Inception," 9.1!!?? Hmmm..
","I'm confused. I admit it, but maybe I'm dreaming. How did this film ever get 9.1 rating!?Rubbish. Pure and simple. So many plot holes, poor story, most obvious plot twist I can remember.On a plus note, once they actually got around to entering the dream, It was pretty good (full of plot holes / inconsitancies, but others have covered these). My problem was - by the time they actually stopped mucking around and got in the dream - I couldn't care less. I was so bored, I'd rather have spooned my eyes out =(I sat in the cinema just thinking 'I just don't care anymore...'SPOILER! As for the whole limbo nonsense - did it need that??? And please, don't anybody tell me they never saw the end plot twist coming from about an hour away! Which also brings me to - If it was his wife's totem, why did it work for him? END SPOILERSRubbish - spend your money on something better.Squinty",Null,9,15,13 August 2010
