The Blair Witch Project," The Artisan Marketing Project
","SPOILER:The Blair Witch Project is NOT real, in fact, people, it isn't even a good film, let alone a horror classic.  Classic horror films don't need a marketing scheme (brilliant as it may have been) to lure teenagers onto the website months before the film is released pretending that it is actually based on real events. First of all, if it was based on real events, it would not be shown in movie theatres; it would be a police record. Second, there was no UNCUT version that many people were led to believe: it's just a MOVIE. The promotional gimmicking that Artisan did prior to release was a stroke of genius; unfortunately the movie did not live up to the hype. If you make an independent movie, at least have SOMETHING happen. The camera work was so deplorable even if there was SOMETHING there in the woods, you wouldn't have seen it anyhow. The acting was unbearable; the ending was non-climatic and made me realise that teenagers were actually PAYING money to see this uninspired piece of horse manure.",1,2,4,10 December 2002
