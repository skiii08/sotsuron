The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Francis Lawrence did it again.
","10/10 STARS! Francis saved this series. The Hunger Games's shaky camera bugged me. But now, Francis came to the rescue. I'm not a great fan of the splitting, but I still loved it. I got the chills every time a scene is done powerfully. It does feel like a set-up for the next part but that doesn't really bother me. Some complain of the lack of action and unnecessary dialogue. But I never got bored and the action felt necessarily distributed. The dialogue was interesting and didn't feel unnecessary. The ending (though I expected it) broke my heart and was just so well done! The way this series is going, Mockingjay Part 2 will be epic. If you complained of the lack of action and haven't read the books, don't worry, cause Part 2 is packed with action. The only thing that bothers me is that we have to wait a whole other year. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 came out in July 2011, with Part 1 coming out in November 2010. They don't need to make us wait a whole year! Well, the only thing we can do is wait.",10,23,61,27 November 2014
The Hunger Games," Great adaptation but with a few pros...
","8/10 STARS! I am a great fan of the book trilogy and was looking forward to this one. It was a 98.5% faithful adaptation and really liked it, but there are a few pros. 1. The editing. It was too chopped out and felt a bit like a Youtube video at times. 2. The shaky camera. It bugged me! Right when the action scenes come up, the camera shakes like if there's an earthquake or something. We couldn't get to see the good stuff. 3. The atmosphere didn't quite feel like I wanted to feel it. Maybe because of the editing and shaky camera, it didn't feel as awesome and science fiction-ish as reading the book. Still, I liked it. My favorite scenes (the destruction of the Career's supplies, the mutts, the feast, the fire, Rue's death, the reaping) were really well done. So it really was a good solid film with great performances that got two stars taken out due to it's editing and shaky camera.",8,1,6,27 November 2014
Orphan," Very disturbing, and thrilling!
","Loved the movie, it's just so disturbing and thrilling and suspenseful, the opening scene is very perturbing as the baby covered in blood and the husband taping her as the poor woman miscarriages is disgusting and chills me. Now I really loved Esther and I really clapped in the theater when she dumped the bratty girl down the slide. The fluorescent paint is a good touch. Now people should realize the movie has a whole sexual climax and the movie's theme is about Esther trying to find her sexuality. We find that out on the twist when we realize she was a 35 year old girl with dwarfism and she wanted to find her sexual manners around men who think she is a girl. And I was really disturbed when the men found the fluorescent paintings in the walls with she and him having sex and all of them are dead except for them. The only reason I gave it an 8 was because of the 2 hours with 3 minutes length and had an unnecessary long character development which almost had me sleeping in the movie theater but then I got woken up by the intensity that followed the the boringness.",8,7,9,2 June 2013
Divergent," Amazingly Good! Of course, it's got flaws...
","Divergent is another movie that joins the sci-fi YA genre. It's been compared to The Hunger Games multiple times, but I think they're not entirely similar, aside from being of the same genre. The world is very interesting. A dystopia disguised as a utopia. People live happily and in peace. Till a conflict arises between two factions and Divergents begin to get hunted down. It's got a lot of action and tension and danger for the main lead. The acting was not Oscar- worthy (though Shailene Woodley had her heart-breaking crying moments) but it wasn't horrendous. By the middle it felt like it dragged on a little bit but it pulls you in immediately. Like in the book, the is-dangerous-being-divergent thing wasn't fully explained and the world-building was not the best (though those who read the books know the origin of the faction system is explained till book 3). The climax was really good and we get to see Shai kick ass with her mother. Kate Winslet delivered a great performance as the baddie also. All in all, Divergent is an amazing movie with all the right touches of action, romance, humor, and intrigue. Since I'm a book fan, I am going to check out Insurgent, the second installment, but even if I haven't had read the books, I would have still wanted to watch it, to know what's coming next.",9,0,2,7 December 2014
Evil Dead," An improvement to movies nowadays.
","I liked this movie, and don't understand why people hate it because there is no Ash, and i mean, it is a remake so you need new characters because it is a re-imagining. Now the no CGI thing is great and it is so chilling. Now i will make some pros and cons for this movie:Pros:1.The 0% CGI 2.The blood rain 3.Natalie deadite 4.the tree rape scene. I mean is so improved. 5.Jane Levy's acting.Cons:1.The opening scene 2.No character development, it just feels rushed. 3.The cheesy dialog 4.How weak the Abomination was 5.Deadite voices",10,4,17,26 May 2013
The Evil Dead," Good and scary but hate how beloved it is
","Yes, this is a good movie and love how Sam Raimi did this movie with such a low budget, but even though it was scary and fun to watch i don't understand why is so beloved by people, I mean it's just a cliché-demon movie with nothing so special, I liked it but it's the same cliché thing and I always enter Bloody Disgusting and see people with a shelf filled with toys collection and movie and magazines and posters abut the Evil Dead franchise. Another thing is, this movie is full of goofs and that irritated me, I mean when Scotty was hitting Cheryl with the ax to put her in the cellar and you can see it is not Cheryl but a doll that is doesn't look like her, I know it is a low budget film but they could either use a foam ax or don't show Cheryl. The part were Linda spits blood and her face is covered with blood when Ash takes her outside the blood disappears from her face, and you don't need a mega budget to just leave the blood in her face, I mean it's a low budget film but doesn't mean that the blood will be removed, that means they forgot the next day they came back to shoot the film",6,0,1,28 March 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Best thing ever!
","10/10 STARS! This movie was so amazing! I read the books, and was a tinsy bit let down by the shaky camera and editing of the first movie. I really liked that one, but I don't know how I could have handled the other movies with that. And then, Gary Ross was replaced by Francis Lawrence. And for God's sake, that saved the movies. The atmosphere felt just like when reading the book, if not better. The soundtrack was beautiful and some scenes were so well done that I got the chills (District 11 scene, Cinna's death, the rising to the arena, jabberjays scene, destruction of the force field, Katniss staring angrily at the screen). Everything wrong with The Hunger Games was fixed here. Jennifer Lawrence's acting is getting better and she did a terrific job. Can't wait for the other movies now that Francis Lawrence is directing them!",10,0,13,27 November 2014
