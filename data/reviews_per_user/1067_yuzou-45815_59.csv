Ford v Ferrari," nice
","It 's not a god, but it 's a movie I love so much emotionally. The Ken Miles shaped by Bell is such a perfect character, is a master of thoughts, and the loss of the world will not pollute him. He doesn't need to prove anything to anyone.",8,2,2,20 April 2020
Iron Man 3," okay
","Very good entertainment popcorn, various explosions and metal sounds impacted by steel, plus many thrilling passages, this time the little carrots staged several melees. Then from time to time come a funny little paragraph, accompanied by Downey's comedy performance. You can't ask too much, but it basically does what an entertainment movie should do. Part of the implantation in the mainland is really too rigid, basically free from the story.",7,0,0,18 March 2020
Gravity," Not perfect
","The picture is slightly new. But it is not as good as 'Prometheus' in terms of magnificence. In the 'silent vacuum', various sound effects are full of annoying. More than 20 years have passed since the Cold War, and the Russian missiles, satellites, and vodka are still conscientiously appearing everywhere in Hollywood movies where they are needed.",7,0,1,13 May 2020
Se7en," nice
","Gloomy and desperate. Christianity uses Satan 's seven demonic figures to represent seven evils: arrogance, jealousy, anger, laziness, greed, gluttony, and lust. A perverted religious killer does not even kill a chicken, but he finds a basis to carry out a creepy murder on people. What could be more terrifying than the act of being a devil alone? Line: 'This is a beautiful world, and it is worth fighting for. I agree with the latter sentence",8,0,0,3 May 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," nice
","Help me, I never thought it would look so good, even Jiang Wen and Zhen Zidan were not embarrassed. Although I haven't seen Star Wars, I really get the blood of this series. I hope that all commercial film directors, everyone this year, learn from this film ps. The leading lady is very handsome, and I believe in love again.",8,0,1,1 April 2020
Captain Marvel," nice
","It 's much better than expected, and it can be said to be the best Marvel solo movie after 'Dr. Strange', which used Marvel 's unsuccessful content to reflect a new charm. This should also be the first time that Marvel heroes have discovered who they are and seek self-awareness. It has a deeper meaning in the packaging of female subjects. Of course, the most happy thing is a lot of tribute elements. The Klingon people in Star Trek, the flying feelings of 'Aspiring Clouds', the subway pursuit of 'French Drug Network', a stunning glance at 'Vulgar Novel', and a third of 'X File', completeness Very high and burning ~",7,1,2,17 March 2020
Knives Out," nice
","It belongs to the kind of good-looking movie, which is regarded as the best detective inference movie that Hollywood has seen in these two years. The whole reasoning and reversal design are very careful, and you really can't guess the truth until you reach the final step. There are several types of conversions in the middle, which are also very thoughtful. The performances are also very unique, yes.",8,2,3,5 April 2020
The Irishman," ok
","First of all, it is worth confirming that the actors are all excellent in acting, but although special effects are used to restore the 70-year-old to a younger age, it seems that the age is very big. I have a period of sitting and falling asleep. The history of the United States is not strong for domestic audiences, so I have to look carefully to see the famous hall. If I look at it again in the future, I might change it again.",7,1,2,27 April 2020
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," okay
","One of the most successful works of the film adaptation game, the action is changeable and gorgeous, the disadvantage is that there is no sequel, no difficulty, of course, Wolverine is so strong ~",7,0,0,22 March 2020
Thor: Ragnarok," good
","One star gave me a short-acting hammer that reached its peak, almost giving me a physiological response on the spot; one star gave Blanchett a foot-buckling show; one star gave a few retro and very powerful electronic soundtracks. Everything else is Marvel-style stupid. Routines are full of entertainment and almost forget them after leaving the cinema.",8,3,6,28 March 2020
Shutter Island," good
","If you just look at this movie as a suspense movie, then at the end you will most likely feel clichÃ© and uninteresting. For me, this is more like a fable movie full of love. It 's not important whether the protagonist and the sentimental protagonist are sick Maybe the author himself is an idealist",8,0,1,16 April 2020
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," very good
","This sequel was repositioned as a spy action movie with great success. The melee combat is very good. The story is closely related to the first episode and accelerates the progress of the Marvel Universe. , Overall, at least ten times better than the first one.",9,4,4,19 March 2020
Tangled," ok
","The first half was splendid, but unfortunately the successor was weak.
The 3D picture is very beautiful. Personality and character modeling are quite outstanding. The two cute creatures, horse and lizard, made me thump in one heart. That beautiful scene on the lake is beautiful! However, overall I am still a bit disappointed.",7,0,0,11 May 2020
Doctor Strange," very very very nice
","The first Marvel movie I watched more than action. The protagonist finally stopped using muscle or money to win, but annoyed the CRY villain with IQ! !! The character build up is very powerful, why a scientist who does not believe in fantasy can become a brain magic wizard, and this psychological transformation process is convincing. The lines are great. They explain a lot of philosophical ideas behind the scenes without humor. I come to bargain !!!",9,0,0,20 March 2020

","I laughed a lot and I was very happy. Lip sync's laughter mixed with latino style laughed to death :) Paul Rudd has a few shots that are very handsome and flaming. He has forgotten that he was still an 'old virgin' with the male god. The heroine is so handsome! However, the previous stage of the literary opera was a bit too long, but it was not enough to enter the climax. Someone nearby told me something that reminded him of 'Interstellar' hahaha.",8,0,0,18 March 2020
Justice League," okay
","The look and feel is not as good as Super Bat, at least that part is still a little cold and forceful. This one looks like a freak product, as if the decision-making layer is confused when it is building the future of DC, and it wants to be cool and think about the market. Part of it is still a serious pretense, but it has not been fully implemented; at the same time, some jokes are added casually, and the story is simpler. The entire video was a sequence, everyone hurriedly appeared, assembled, fought, and ended. I look forward to the protagonist of the second egg.",7,6,9,28 March 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," very nice
","Human nature and other creatures have their own vulnerabilities, so even if they choose good, they can also be vulnerable to other directions, just like the Queen of the Forest. What is more terrible is that the evil means are used to achieve the purpose of goodness. Essentially, the poison is used to attack the poison, and the evil is used to resist the evil. .",9,0,0,13 April 2020

The Amazing Spider-Man," very good
","It's not just old wine in new bottles, the careful thinking of the director Xiaoxin adds a lot of loving details to Spider-Man, and the overall rhythm is smooth. Although the first-person perspective in the trailer is just a glimpse in the movie, 3D is excellent Visual effects are first-rate. Sister Stone has a faint Icon gas field, the most praised is Garfield, the acting is excellent, a pair of big watery eyes are lovely and charming, and the slender figure in the tights is really beautiful! !!",8,1,1,25 March 2020
X-Men: Days of Future Past," nice
","Premiere, super cool hero blockbuster, two timeline parallel narratives, many characters, laughter and heavy balance, although the plot is not as good as the first battle, but the effect is beyond, the small details to the big scene are all there; Fan Ye doesn't make many appearances but is very attractive; the ending is the moment when fans scream; the end of the full subtitles has a shocking egg",8,0,0,27 March 2020
Saving Private Ryan," nice
","This movie, adapted from the true story of World War II, gave the audience a strong shock. The plot of the story is touching because it taps into the inner world of ordinary soldiers. Hearing was also impacted during the viewing of the movie. The war scenes of the Battle of Normandy, the bloodshed footage, and the magnificent sound effects made people feel as if they were immersed in the scene, and they heard a sound, which left a deep impression, which triggered Reflections on war cherish peace even more.",8,0,0,4 May 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," ok
","Probably a movie with extremely high knowledge reserve requirements for fans, it is indeed comparable to the ultimate battle in the sense of the history of pan-film. The test preparation is not as good as mine. It is also hearty to watch the last 30 minutes. If the front stalk is unreachable, it may cause a lot of urine spots, and intuitively Bruce Lee 's passage may be risky in the mainland.",7,0,3,15 April 2020

Schindler's List," very nice
","This is not just a plot, but also a comprehensive victory in technology, footage, editing, acting and soundtrack. Expression is a skill, not determined by the script and background. All of this is caused by the skill and luck of the director. It is unquestionable, but it can be encountered-'Schindler's List' can be described as thick and thin. And the background of facts, Schindler 's own matter is still controversial, but the film has been interpreted and qualitative in front of people all over the world, which shows the great influence of the media",9,0,1,29 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," so so
","To be honest, I am not satisfied with this one, which is much worse than the rumored Grand Theft Auto One. So many high ratings in North America seriously suspect that the emperor's new clothes can't be moved. The story processing is simplified. I really ca n't talk about the motivation of some two roles, especially criticizing the heroine 's acting skills, it 's almost the level of the dragon mother 's possession, and the second Asian female hero can finish it. The best movie is only when Luke Skywalker returns.",7,0,10,29 March 2020

","Wolverine's curtain call performance was very literary and sensational, and of course the bloody index also broke the table. Superheroes who are tortured by the aging disease must be as beautiful as autumn leaves even if they die. Professor X made me cry, Oh Charles ...",8,1,1,11 April 2020
Avengers: Age of Ultron," good
","Generally speaking, it didn't reach the first experience that I wanted to make people feel right away. Both funny and flaming are not enough, which should be the weak law of the sequel movie. The appearance of many characters is dazzling, but they are still distinct. Jarvis and Vison are amazingly fit, and there are not many twins. The emotional drama of widow and Hulk is the softest moment. The existence of Ultron is slightly lower. Not fierce enough, the captain swears Thor Thor hammer joke throughout.",8,2,3,26 March 2020

","It's so good that I didn't waste a second.
Great work, instead of fighting in literary films, it is better to raise the standard of commercial films like this!",9,1,2,30 March 2020
Midsommar," no
","The uncontrolled stacking of visual symbols further exposes the lack of scheduling, and the result is a keen view of the Nordic folk culture. The trailer's performance of Jiyue made me expect too much, and the director actually failed to make a smooth transition from 'dark horror' to 'bright horror'. . The development of the hostess's grief has not been properly expressed (repeated walk away + tears + malicious), so that the final expression imitation is slightly inexplicable.",4,7,10,7 May 2020
Pulp Fiction," nice
","The masterpiece of the non-linear narrative film. The structure is ingenious and meaningful, with wonderful dialogue. Everyone in the film has beautiful qualities, but they are hopelessly going to darkness and confusion. Each paragraph has no beginning and end, a complementary structure, and the beginning and end are connected, suggesting that the plots in similar movies in reality always happen and never stop.
Line: Why do we have to keep talking nonsense to maintain the atmosphere? Only when you find a truly special person can you shut up and enjoy a moment of silence.",9,1,1,25 April 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," okay
","Maybe I am a bit disappointed because I like the first one too much, especially those humorous and cute humorous jokes. It is simply the recycling of the first humor. It is nothing new and looks particularly dry. Even the sensational and nostalgic golden songs seem to meet Barely deliberately. However, visual effects and art design are still worth a look. The whole movie may just be two or three games can barely persist for a week and then forget.",7,0,0,21 March 2020
Thor," good
","Pretty good comic movie. The background of the Nordic myth is quite flavorful! The special effects of Starry Sky, Asgard and Tree of Life are really beautiful and gorgeous! Brother and brother's love is so touching! All the settings that have been completely in line with the tortured text are there! There is also a glimpse of the big cute little bow and arrow eagle eyes! If you fall in love with the male lead, tell him yourself!",8,0,0,22 March 2020

Joker," very nice
","This is not a good 'clown' movie, because it departs from the chaotic and unpredictable nature of the role of the clown, giving the clown a tragic but traceable cause. But this does not prevent the film from becoming a good movie. This is a crime film that is out of the superhero-like surrealism. Mind fucks the audience all the time, until the final climax. The unique performance of Jacques Phoenix gave this clown a tragic artistic personality full of contradictions and pain. I can already foresee him sweeping the awards season. Just like the crime classic 'Taxi Driver', 'Clown' is the only choice of this era.",9,2,2,3 April 2020

","Very surprised, this unknown female director gave a lesson to all male directors: how to have both big and small love under the premise of ensuring the scene and visual effects. The emotional drama was just right, the final battle effect was also good, the girl next to him was sobbing, this time finally pulled back a city for DC. But the biggest flaw is that the villain 's appearance is really ugly, and the drama is instantaneous ... And, what is the comment in the comments about the Virgin?",8,4,8,25 March 2020

","In the face of insidious, deep, and wise eyes, and in the face of kindness, doubt, and immature eyes, I also saw a trace of confusion and contradiction, a loss of understanding of human nature, and a defense of the contradiction between my inner world and deviant behavior.

X-Men: First Class," nice
","The credibility of the first battle lies in a solid script and the setting of the era background. He abandons the superhero movie mode that has been misled for the sake of creating visual spectacles. In order to understand the complex cognition of the mutants, humans, and humans in the original work, they seek the self-orientation of the speculative tradition. The movie has nothing to do with the comic of the same name, there are some mysterious and ultimate mashups (WHAT IF?)",8,0,0,24 March 2020

","The ending painted eggshell is still very interesting. Wolverine also belongs to an over-exploited character, and the whole film is entangled in the past pain and undead confusion.

","This is a rare and easy science fiction film. The film deliberately weakens the most common fears of the science fiction film about the future and the unknown universe, but talks about people conquering the sky and science to save humanity.
