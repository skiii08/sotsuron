The Avengers," Nice, but not THAT good.
","This was a long anticipated movie that teams up multiple superheroes for the first time and confirms MCU completely. The last five MCU movies have all be leading up to this. And it's here now. So, is it good?I like it that they tried making a comic book cinematic universe and teaming up all those superheroes. In fact, I love that idea. And it got very good ratings and I liked the movie. It was fun, it was well done, the dialogues were well written and it was so cool to see all these heroes working together. And also, Alan Silvestri's score is very good and it's one of the best superhero movie themes I've ever heard. But the story, the similar problem I had before, just wasn't big or epic enough. It felt like a special longer TV episode with huge budget. The plot was just too simple for such an epic idea and most of the main plot happens in one day. It's not messy at all but that's because of the thin plot. And even when there are in danger there are still humorous parts, so when there are some emotional moments, they don't really fit in. There is a death of a side character somewhere in the middle and everyone is so sad about it, but I could barely remember his name, so it did nothing for me. But it's not about the actors. The acting is great and everyone shines in their roles, but I still liked Tom Hiddleston as Loki the most. Also there is a recast of one character, Hulk. He's played by Mark Ruffalo and I think he's also pretty good in his own way. Ruffalo is closer to the comics, but Norton's grounded approach was very good and it shows us how badly affected he is with his 'gift'. And one more flaw, enemies were to easily defeated in my opinion. Aside from Loki's plan and all the fights between them in the first half, The Avengers never really faced anything that was a really big threat and they got out of every danger too easily.Very fun, very well done movie and the first superhero team up movie and that's way it gets so much points from me, but I was just slightly disappointed because of the lack of challenge to the heroes and the weak plot.",8,0,1,29 June 2016
Blade Runner 2049," All those generic movies will be lost in time like tears in the rain. This is not one of those movies.
","Blade Runner 2049 is a sequel to a 1982 dystopian sci-fi classic Blade Runner. It's directed by incredible Dennis Villenueve (Arrival, Prisoners, Sicario, Enemy, I think I said enough) and stars Ryan Gosling, Jared Leto and Harrison Ford who is returning here. I'm not going to tell you anything about the plot because I find it better going into it blind, so I will get to my thoughts on this.I've heard a lot of people call the first one overrated, but I love each and every cut of it, so I guess you can say I was pretty hyped for this. And with the talent attached to it, my expectations were nothing short of great. And this movie actually managed to live up to those expectations. I've had a blast watching this. I have so much more respect for Sony now because it took bravery to put this much effort and money in what's essentially a big budget art film. Don't go into it expecting an action movie. The trailers might sell it as one, but there is only one longer action scene at the end. I'd say even the first one had more action. But, that doesn't take away from the movie. I just sat there in the theater and sunk into this gorgeous movie. If you love neon lights with a soundtrack filled with synths like I do, just go for it, you will love it. Visually, it's one of the most gorgeous movies I've ever seen, if not the most gorgeous. It also gave us more of this world that's disgusting and so beautiful at the same time and one that you can just get lost in. Loneliness and isolation are one of the major themes here (as the depression that comes with it) and the world is like a reflection of that. It's very slow, but the slow pace adds a lot of depth here. Honestly, I wish it was longer. There's quite a lot of ambiguity (don't expect to get much answers to the questions from the first one) and some loose ends left in the plot. But they are left by the subplots. And those subplots are not our lead's story. They only helped drive his story and it makes sense that they were unfinished. It might bother some, but it didn't bother me. It's like that for a reason. Who knows, we might even get another one. If they continue like this, I'm all in for it.I wish they make more movies like this. Because this was brilliant and now it left me wanting more. I still don't know if I prefer this or the first one because both are kinda their own movies and I love them both equally in different ways. It's a slow- burn, but a very enjoyable and beautiful slow-burn.",10,10,22,17 October 2017
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," It's an okay movie, but the split was really unnecessary.
","When I heard they were going to split the last book in two movies, I was really disappointed. They said there is too much story to fit in one movie. Yeah, right, and I'm Lady GaGa. I still tried to look on the bright side and remembered how the book felt rushed at times and maybe the story will have more space to breathe. But here, it kinda seems like the story was forced to breathe very deep. Too deep. This isn't a bad movie at all. It's just too stretched for it's own good and turns out to be a total cashgrab. It's very well done and 'The Hanging Tree' sequence with the dam scene was one of the best moments in the series. The plot doesn't really go anywhere for the most of the screen time. There's the District 8 part, some rebel scenes and the movie's third act. That's it. But the third act is awesome. That part wasn't really that intense in the book and that's when they showed the potential and some creativity. The book is in first person POV, but the movie isn't and that's the good thing because in the book we hear about some exciting stuff, but in the movie we actually get to see it and that's really good and the third act is mostly what made me like this movie. If you didn't read the book, the twist ending will definitely get you and you will want to watch the next movie immediately. One more problem I have with this film is that Katniss simply isn't an interesting character anymore. Tears, nightmares, traumas... I know she's been through a lot and I can understand that she's stressed and that they should show it in the movie, but they show it way too much. There was this scene when she's dreaming and I was like: 'And this was necessary because...' In conclusion, this movie is still pretty much okay and will totally make you want to see the next one.",7,1,4,21 November 2015
The Incredible Hulk," So different from other movies in MCU that it almost seems non-canon
","Iron Man was a great start of Marvel Cinematic Universe that gets you excited to see more. The second outing is The Incredible Hulk which stars Edward Norton as Bruce Banner a.k.a. The Hulk. Hulk appears in some other movies in MCU, but he's never played by Edward Norton again and is replaced by Mark Ruffalo, and also Hulk never looks the way he does in this movie again and all that makes it seem like Marvel decided to ignore this movie. Which is strange, because this movie is actually pretty decent.It's not as good as most of the MCU movies that are out by now, but what I liked about it is that they actually tried something different and this is probably the only movie in MCU's Phase One that actually took itself completely seriously. Who says it always has to be cheesy with jokes in the middle of the battle? Characters are fleshed out pretty well and Norton's portrayal of Hulk shows us what being Hulk really is like. It's not cool, it's not awesome. In fact, it's terrible. He doesn't want to be this way and I think it's very well shown. The Hulk also looks very menacing and scary and the villain, Abomination, even more. But still, no matter how much mayhem he causes sometimes, he's just misunderstood and I heard Norton was involved in some creative process, so that was probably him. The problem with this movie is that the story itself isn't memorable enough. At least for me. They had a good idea, showing how Bruce Banner struggles with Hulk, but they could still do more with all that. The effects also don't look as believable as they should and considering how big the budget was, it's not really a good thing. But one more good thing is that it's not setting up anything except in the last scene so it's not distracting and this movie can be easily seen as a stand- alone.The movie itself isn't bad. It tried to have a more serious approach and that made me appreciate it a lot. The problem is that it's just not that memorable and that's the reason while it's almost the weakest movie in MCU.",7,0,1,27 June 2016
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Actually decent
","I still remember the first time I tried to watch this movie. I was 13 when I watched the original trilogy for the first time and I loved it. I wasn't really interested in seeing the prequels as I heard they are not good, but then I caught this one on TV few months after watching the originals and I barely made it through the first half and then I stopped. I absolutely hated it and even called it the worst movie ever for some time. Then there was the entire hype for The Force Awakens and I decided to watch them all before seeing The Force Awakens, doesn't matter if I don't like some of them, I'll watch them all. So, after watching the original trilogy, it was the time for this one. I was kinda bored at the beginning, but later realized that it's actually not bad at all. The effects look a little dated, but a lot of them were practical, so I'll forgive them. The acting is nothing special, just good enough to not be bad and Ewan McGregor probably gave the best performance and he's one of the very few who stand out. But what really made me like this movie is the villain, Darth Maul. He's one of the coolest villains ever and is my favorite Star Wars character so far. Too bad he's so underused and I really hope they make a spin-off (in my opinion, he's a much more interesting character than Boba Fett) about him or bring him back in the new trilogy. Ray Park also nailed the role even with only few lines (from what I heard, it wasn't even his voice), but he's really intimidating and I could talk about his character all day but I'll stop now to say more about the movie. And the award for the worst comic relief ever goes to Jar Jar Binks! He's one of the biggest reasons people hate this movie and you'll see why. And while everyone is talking about him, everyone forgets about Sebulba. Gosh, that underrated a-hole! He's the most annoying character in every movie ever! These two were also a big reason why I used to hate this movie. Looking on the directing, Lucas didn't do the greatest job ever, and considering he was also a writer of this movie, and looking back at A New Hope, we all know he can do much better then this. But still, it turned out okay, could've been better, but it's not the worst in the series. The worst in my opinion comes after this, with Attack of the Clones. But I'm not gonna say much about it here, I'll leave that for it's own review.",6,6,8,26 December 2015
It," It is pretty good, but a bit too conventional
","It is a new adaptation of Stephen King's novel of the same name about a mysterious entity that shows up every 27 years to feed on children. Sometimes in the form of something they are most afraid off and sometimes just in the form of the clown and then this group of kids tries to put an end to the whole thing.I had extremely high expectations that only increased when I heard about all the great reviews. And it's by no means a bad movie, but it certainly is a bit of a disappointment. The story isn't very faithful to the book, but it mostly keeps to the spirit of the novel and contains the essential elements. Adapting that book onto the screen is no easy job, so I'm gonna be a bit forgiving. One thing this movie nailed though is the characters. That's the best thing about this movie. The characters and the performances. Every member of The Losers Club has their own personality and everyone stands out. But still, not entirely (Mike was very underdeveloped). Still, everyone shines in their roles. And Bill Skarsgård is incredible as Pennywise. He's not always terrifying, but he did a fantastic job. I thought both him and Tim Curry in the 1990 TV miniseries were great in their own ways. And they both fit their versions perfectly. Since 1990 version is more of a fun Halloween movie, Curry is a lighter and sillier spin on the character. But this version is darker and creepier, and so is Skarsgård's Pennywise. The characters are a joy to watch, they absolutely nailed that aspect of adapting. And, as I said, it's not easy to adapt this book. But I think they were playing a bit too safe here.The cosmic horror aspect of the book was one of the most fascinating and terrifying to me, so I was really wondering how they would translate that to a movie. The problem is, they didn't even try. And that's why it feels a bit too ordinary and conventional. If that part was done right, it would have been amazing. Maybe they are saving that for the second part of the story, who knows? In case you didn't know this was only half of the story and the book has a part when they are kids and when they are all grown up, 27 years later. I hope they are saving more mature and creepy parts for the sequel. Also, I was very disappointed by the horror aspect as a whole. The opening scene was very disturbing and creepy, but the movie just doesn't retain that atmosphere. I wanted this movie to get under my skin and give me shivers, but you just don't really feel that sense of dread. You've got some fun scenes with jump-scares, but it's never really as terrifying as I expected it to be. And something the director doesn't realize (same mistake can also be seen in his previous film, Mama) is that the more you show the monster, less scary it becomes. And Pennywise is shown way too much. He's creepy at the beginning, but eventually becomes just fun to watch. And that's not really a good thing for a horror movie.But nevertheless, this is still a fun and enjoyable movie that I will definitely be coming back to. They got most of the characters, themes and story on point, but the scares are where this movie really disappoints. What was supposes to be a unique, refreshing and terrifying experience turns into a fun (at times laugh-out-loud funny), but too ordinary and conventional experience. Still, I had a good time and will be coming back to it. It just wasn't what I expected.",8,6,10,17 September 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rogue One:A Well-Thought But Poorly Executed Story
","Rogue One is a first spin off in a Star Wars franchise and a first movie in Star Wars Anthology series. It's set right before 'A New Hope' and shows how the rebels stole the Death Star plans. It's directed by Gareth Edwards, the director of Godzilla (2014), which I loved, bit still I didn't feel a lot of excitement going into this, but I did expect it to be pretty good. And it actually managed to disappoint me.It's not entirely bad, I will say what I liked about it first. Darth Vader, he shows up in only two scenes, but boy does he make an impact in those two scenes. We are reminded of why he is one of the best villains ever and the scene near the end, shows us the Vader we all missed since episode VI, but never got. Well, we've got it now and that scene at the end may quite possibly be the best in the series. The movie has some visually wonderful moments and the action is well- handled. The story helps close a plot-hole about Death Star from a New Hope, I really appreciated that. And now I have a new favorite droid in the series - K-2SO. That guy is brilliant. If you love sarcastic and sassy characters like I do, you will love K-2SO.The sad part is, those are probably the only good parts. Darth Vader is great, yes, but he's barely in the movie at all. Instead we get an extremely uninteresting and paper-thin villain. And why waste such a good opportunity? I'm not asking for Vader to be a main villain, but if you have a chance to put him in the movie, use it a bit more. That's too good of an opportunity to miss. And yet they miss. I just talked about uninteresting villain, and the rest of the characters aren't much better. Some of them may actually end up being interesting if they aren't immediately killed and we're moved to the next plot point. I didn't even care about the main character. We barely knew who she was too. We're just watching things happen before eyes, but we don't feel it. At least I didn't. And how could I? The story itself is good, but it's so poorly executed and fails to grab any interest. Except if you only want to see action. The movie also had re-shoots. And it shows. It really does show. Everyone complained about Suicide Squad for that, and no one complains about this. I'm not a DC fanboy, so if I sound like one, I apologize. But I liked Suicide Squad. It was choppy, yes, but it wasn't terrible. It had the charisma, it had the appeal and it was a lot more fun. Here, nah. There is barely anything interesting about this movie and how this story was executed. We just jump from a plot point to a plot point like nothing happened. The movie just doesn't have any soul. It has a few highlights that don't stop it from being a disappointment. If you just like expensive action sci-fi movies, let alone the quality, sure, enjoy. But this was not my cup of tea.",4,2,4,31 January 2017
Iron Man 2," God, that was fun!
","Whenever someone mentions Iron Man 2, they usually call it bad or say something bad about it. But I think it was actually pretty good and I had so much fun. I guarantee, you won't be bored for a second.It wasn't better than the first Iron Man, but it was better than The Incredible Hulk. It's lighter than The Incredible Hulk, but darker than Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. shines again in the leading role and this time we is developed a lot more than in the first one. In the first one, he is shown as this cool, funny scientist who becomes a superhero, but what I liked here the most is that we get to see that he is no more than just another ordinary human with his own personal conflicts. We get to see who Tony Stark really is. This movie also brings us some new faces: Scarlett Johansson as a super-cool female hero Natasha Romanoff a.k.a. Black Widow, Sam Rockwell as one out of the two villains is really annoying but that's probably the way his character is supposed to be so I don't blame him, with the other villain being played by Mickey Rourke. And why Rourke was decent, he was just that typical Russian villain you see in many Hollywood movies. And also, Terrence Howard was recast and Don Cheadle got his role and I can say that Cheadle may even be a bit better. Some people say that a big problem of this movie is that it's setting up MCU too much. But if you ask me, that kinda had to happen eventually and they made it fit with the plot so it isn't all over the place.Overall, this movie was very entertaining and it's also probably the best of the 'weaker' MCU movies so far.",8,1,2,27 June 2016
The Hunger Games," Better than you would expect
","I'm a book reader and I liked the book very much so I had high expectations for this movie. If you think this is another boring teen movie with sci-fi and fantasy elements, you're wrong. The story is pretty interesting and it's also great as an adaptation. While it's not as brutal as the book, it has almost every plot point and book fans will not be disappointed. The story will probably remind you of Battle Royale, but it doesn't make this movie bad. Performances are great and it really feels real. Some people complained about Gary Ross' direction and all that shaky cam. While I'm not the fan of shaky cam, it kinda worked here because it doesn't look like typical sci-fi blockbuster and it gave a more realistic note to the movie and it also helped cover up some more graphic moments in the movie. I didn't really like the visuals and it's still hard for me to believe that the budget was 78 million dollars but I could deal with it. After all, this is a very good and emotional movie and very faithful to it's source material.",8,1,4,18 November 2015
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," From a fairy tale to epic fantasy!
","This is a REALLY unpopular opinion but I think the first book was kinda overrated. It was too short and felt a bit rushed but that's just my opinion. The movie was faithful to the book bit there was one massive change. The book (and the BBC series) felt more like a fairy tale but they made the movie so epic! Some people may call it overlong but I loved it and honestly, I think it wouldn't be as epic if it was 90-120 min. CGI is incredible and everything looks so realistic! And young actors were great as the Pevensie children. Liam Neeson gives a powerful voice performance as Aslan and Tilda Swinton was pure evil as The White Witch.Jim Broadbent didn't have much scenes in the movie but he was really likable and his character will be better introduced in the rest of the franchise. Book readers will know. The beginning of the movie throws as straight in the action while introducing the Pevensies running into shelter during the World War II. The movie may be a little depressing at the beginning until they go to Narnia. Narnia is really beautiful and while it's the cold winter in the first half it still feels beautiful and the second half is spring and that's way this movie is the best to watch around Christmas and Easter. It's both magical and incredibly epic!",10,0,0,1 September 2015
Point Break," So much hate just for being a remake
","Guys, this is a good movie. Obviously, it's not as good as the original, but that was pretty clear from the beginning. I didn't expect much from this movie and one afternoon I was really in the mood for going to cinema and decided to give this movie a chance. At least it looked good for cinema so I thought I couldn't go wrong with it because I'll at least have fun. And I was very pleasantly surprised!The original movie is awesome and one of my favorites and good thing about this one is that it tried to be something different so it's not just same thing again. While the original is just surfing and skydiving, this one is focused on extreme sports much more and if you are going to see it for surfing you won't see much of that because it's only in two scenes (but still very good scenes). The movie is very well shot and action scenes are eye candy. Actors are not as good as Patrick Sawyze and Keanu Reeves but they are pretty good.People are criticizing this movie way too much just because it's a remake but there are still flaws. There is almost no character development at all. Maybe just a little with two main characters, but the rest are so forgettable they might have as well put dummies instead of actors. And also a few plot holes, but if people forgive all those ridiculous moments to the Fast & Furious franchise, I'll do the same with this, and also, this is in my opinion a better movie than Furious 7.This movie is not boring at all and it's full of well done action sequences and it's absolutely worth watching. I will not even call it a guilty pleasure, because I'll always defend this movie when someone starts complaining about it. If you don't mind remakes, you'll probably like this. And if you don't like remakes, then just don't watch this, simple!",8,1,6,11 January 2016
Spotlight," Just decent
","After seeing all of the best picture nominees this year, I have to say this is my least favorite. It's a good movie, that's for sure, but I wasn't really blown away by it.This movie is incredibly well written and especially acted (I want to point out Mark Rufallo and Liev Schreiber) and the story was very interesting. But still, when I finished watching the movie, I just didn't have that special feeling I get when I watch a great movie. It's not boring at all and it's not afraid to go into details, it's very realistic and sometimes it even feels like you are watching something real happen. This did happen and at some parts you really feel like you are watching that and not the movie and also some parts are really messed up. It's never shown, bit you are shocked just by characters talking about it which is great. But I just didn't find myself so invested in the story.It's a very well done movie, but to me it feels like something is missing and till the end of the movie, I wasn't that interested anymore, but I think many people will like this movie.",7,4,6,16 February 2016
Thor: Ragnarok," Way too funny for it's own good
","Thor:Ragnarok is already the 17th movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the third Thor movie. It's directed by Taika Waititi (Hunt for the Wilderpeople) and stars Chris Hemsworth, Cate Blanchett, Mark Ruffalo and Tom Hiddleston. In this one Thor faces Hela who wants to take over Asgard, she casts him out and this time he's thrown on a completely different planet where he reunites with Hulk and tries to build a team to stop Hela.This movie is very funny (even though there are a few forced jokes) and light-hearted. But is that necessarily a good thing? I'm not saying this movie should be humorless. But they really went over the top with this one. I'm used to Marvel joking around, but they usually know when to get emotional. Not here. I mean it's freaking Ragnarok, that's supposed to be really, really epic! And at least serious at the end. The movie is really anything but epic. Just when things starts to get serious it seems the writers chicken out and guess what, here's another joke for you! Would you look at that? Isn't that hilarious? Ha, ha, ha! Don't get me wrong, I laughed at quite a lot of them, but sometimes it really seems like they were trying way too hard. Characters are very goofy. A bit too much. To everyone thinking they got everyone right here, remember this. Thor is a god of thunder. A freaking god, not some random funny dude! I'm not saying he should be serious, Thir never was like that, but this is way too much. There are maybe two or three actually kinda serious scenes in the entire movie that are pretty good, but then it all turns to silliness again and those scenes feel like they belong to a different movie they continued making a spoof of. I know that all this might sound like I hated the movie, but it's far from that, I'll get to the pros now. This is probably the most stylish MCU ever got. Regardless of the silliness it's probably the most creative direction we got from Marvel yet. Even though it could have been more, but that's on the writers. We get this colorful fantasy world with a lot of synth-wave music popping up in the background. And two amazing uses of 'Immigtant Song' by Led Zeppelin. The acting is pretty good and you can see the actors enjoying themselves in the roles. Also, the ending was pretty surprising, but just as many parts of this movie, was ruined with constant jokes. There were a lot of surprising and entertaining cameos, I loved those as they added fuel to the fun that this movie was.All in all, while it's good, I thought it was a huge disappointment since in my opinion this story should have been handled a bit more seriously. I did get tons fun and laughs, but it's not what I wanted from this movie. This was supposed to be epic. I expected one of the best MCU movies, but honestly I thought it was closer to the weaker ones. But it's the best one of the Thor movies. And it's still a lot of fun with a little deviation in style that felt necessary to freshen the franchise up a bit.",7,1,4,10 November 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," 'Friendly-neighborhood' is back on track!
","Spider-Man:Homecoming had a lot of reasons to be bad. It's a second reboot in 5 freaking years, the very spoilery trailers, and there seemed to be over- reliance on the MCU with Tony Stark looking like he has a major part in the story (which kinda disgraces Spidey as a character, since he always manages on his own and that's what makes him such a great character). Well, thankfully, it only seemed so. Because this is one of the best Spider-Man movies.To be honest, I never hated The Amazing Spider-Man movies. Yes, the second one was really weird, but I didn't really hate that one either. I just thought they had a lot of greater potential to reach, so when they quit with that series and decided to give it a reboot in the MCU, I was a bit skeptical. I really liked Holland's performance in Captain America:Civil War, that was a great start and even after two actors, Holland managed to bring the character of Peter Parker in another unique way (and that's the case in this movie too). But, based on the trailers, I didn't like where the whole thing was going. Spidey movies always had a unique feel to them and this looked like just another generic Marvel movie that doesn't even respect its character enough. It turns out, this is probably the best depiction of the character yet. Maguire wasn't much as Spider-Man, but he was a great Peter Parker. Garfield was a great Spider-Man, but too cool of a Peter Parker. Holland works beautifully as both. And that whole Tony Stark thing, he's really not in the movie that much and Peter gets around all by himself, just like it should be. The performances were all very good if not great and the characters are very likable, but one actor I would like to point out is Michael Keaton as the villain, The Vulture. He is incredible. Quite possibly the best Spidey movie villain yet. He's not bland, nor over the top. He's just the right amount of menace. And it's fantastic. There is even a certain plot twist that will make him all the more menacing, you will see for yourself. I also loved how, while the film might not have the feel of the rest of the Spidey movies, it doesn't have that same old MCU feel either. It has its own thing and it rocks.But still, since I gave it a 9, there are some drawbacks I would like to point out. There are still some characters that are changed way too much. They don't even feel like the same characters, but I will not reveal who exactly. It's not that they are bad, but it just didn't feel right. Also, in order to add some more humor, I guess, Spidey is one bit too clumsy. And when he's in action, he should (mostly) slay it. And also, I get it that showing the origin for the third time already would be a drag, but they just threw it away, so we have a complete lack of origin. If in some case you don't know origin, don't expect to get it here. I was hoping there will be a creative way to show it again in a fast way (like in The Incredible Hulk) or at least mention it. But nope, it's completely left in the air.Still, let alone these minor flaws, this was a surprisingly very good and fun outing with a lot of respect to the source material and a unique feel on its own. Looking forward to see more!",9,2,7,31 August 2017
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Almost a masterpiece
","Now this is an unpopular opinion, but I think this movie is a little bit better than A New Hope. A New Hope was a very good movie, but something felt missing there. The Empire Strikes Back was a masterpiece, and this one is also very good, but flawed. I think almost everyone agrees that the main problem here are the Ewoks, like I do. They are cute little fellas and everything, but they just don't fit into this movie and makes the story too light- hearted while it's actually pretty serious and it is shown in parts with Luke, Vader and the Emperor, and I think that part is a bit underused. Seriousness is what this movie lacks. Not to be completely dark and serious, but more like the previous movie, and the Ewoks don't help. And it's also laughable how easily can Stormtroopers be killed. I mean, like, Ewoks beat them down in a few seconds. What??? Luckily, those were the only bad sides here. Humor works really good for the most of the time, especially with C-3PO and R2-D2. I love them. The action is well done as always and while there are many goofy and light-hearted parts of the movie, it has some very serious parts which I mentioned above that are really well done. Luke Skywalker has really developed as a character and now he's one of the coolest characters in the franchise. Here we also get to see a more human side of Darth Vader and he has never felt so vulnerable, especially with the arrival of the new big bad:The Emperor. The actor who is playing him (I can't remember the name, I'm really sorry) was so awesome. Just the way he moves, the way he speaks, his face expressions, everything was just great and just enough not to be goofy and that's one of the best performances in the series. Overall, this is a satisfying fast-paced finale of the original trilogy, and while not as good ad it's predecessor, and considered by many people to be the weakest in the original trilogy is still a great movie and one more timeless classic.",9,1,3,26 December 2015
Suicide Squad," Ignore the critics. If you're interested at least one bit, go see it You won't regret it.
","My expectations were very high and this was my most anticipated movie of the year. I've been waiting for it for more than a year. And now it's finally here. And it was well worth the wait.Some critics call it worse than Green Lantern and last year's Fantastic Four. Well, that's where critics become haters because any person who says that is crazier than Harley Quinn. This movie ISN'T that bad. In fact, if you're a fan, you will love it. If you don't know much about the source material or DC Comics in general, the least you will think is that it was fun. Think Guardians of the Galaxy, DC version. Without space or aliens. And it's got an awesome soundtrack too. The critics say both that the plot is thin and that it's overstuffed. Just there you can see that they are just nitpicking. I'll be honest, the plot IS thin, but like the plot of The Avengers isn't. And yet, no one mentioned that. And it's still a good movie (to me not as good as everyone says, but okay). And this is even better. At least it is to me. It kinda depends if you like DC or Marvel more. But still, if you prefer Marvel, you will think this was at the very least entertaining. There were clearly some disagreements between the director and the studio because the studio wanted a more light-hearted and funnier movie, while Ayer wanted it to be darker and it isn't very well balanced and that's the reason why the movie feels choppy at times. The first half is full of dark humor and while there is some over- exposition, it sets up the characters very well. The second half is a bit more serious, but that was necessary to add some more emotional weight to everything. Maybe it does seem gloomy at times (I was, honestly, never bothered by that because that's what DC is and I don't see why everyone has a problem with that), but even tho I liked Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, I will admit and say that this movie has something those two movies didn't have. The appeal. And the main reason for that is the best thing about the movie:the characters. They are well written (a few of them are kinda paper thin, let's take Killer Croc for example) and every actor nailed the role he or she played. And by the way, don't expect to see much of The Joker. Leto killed it and he captivates every time he's on screen, but he's on screen for probably 10 minutes in total. But even tho everyone was great in their roles, the biggest star of the movie is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. I just couldn't write this review without mentioning her. I can't wait to see more of her and Leto. And also Jai Courtney as Captain Boomeramg nailed it. If you didn't like him before, you will still like him here, trust me. Also, if you were worried about the PG-13 rating, stop worrying. When you see the movie, you will see that it didn't even need an R rating. R rating would probably just make it look kinda pretentious.Basically, if you're interested, go see it and ignore the critics. This is the best DCEU movie yet and if you're a fan, it's guaranteed that you'll love it!",8,98,220,5 August 2016
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," It has some nice moments, but also some horrible moments
","The Phantom Menace was a disappointment, but still not bad. This would be terrible if there weren't some nice moments. First let me tell you about those. Ewan McGregor is even better now and also kinda sounds like Alec Guiness. That chase at the beginning was awesome, the part on that rainy planet even better, the meteorite scene similar to the one in The Empire Strikes Back, and some fights at the end would be great if the CGI wasn't so obvious in some parts. And also, while many people didn't like this new CGI Yoda, I really liked him and he's so cool, especially in that duel scene at the end. The first half of the movie is really slow and while the Obi-Wan part is good, the one with Anakin and Padme was awful. The part on Tatooine was okay and that is probably the only part of the movie where Hayden Christensen was decent. The dialogues are embarrassing in some scenes (I don't like sand) and someone should've told Lucas that he isn't writing a Shakespearian play! It's just so cringeworthy my face turned red. The romance between Anakin and Padme feels so fake and forced and so awfully done it made me lose faith in George Lucas. But he's the reason this franchise exists so I forgive him. The second half is a little bit faster, but my interest was already lost and I didn't even follow most of it. At least Jar Jar was only there for a few minutes. So, if there wasn't for some good action scenes this movie would suck. It's actually solid this way, but remains the worst movie in the franchise.",5,0,3,27 December 2015
The Lost City of Z," Advertised as thrilling, but it's pretty much just a biopic...
","The Lost City of Z is a movie about a British man at the beginning of a 20th century who goes to expedition in Bolivia, but finds more than he was looking for and that grows into an obsession. It stars Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Tom Holland. Judging by the trailers, it looked like a grounded and thrilling adventure movie, but it's really not that. It's pretty much just a biopic, actually.I knew that it's based on a true story, but I thought it was a bit more fictionalized version of it. Maybe it really is, I don't know. But if it is, then it could have been a lot better. As you see, I don't know some of the facts about the movie. That's because the movie didn't grip me enough to actually be interested in all that. It's well-shot, extremely well-acted (particularly by Hunnam and Holland) and it does have it's interesting moments, but with the bad pacing and aside from the main character and some of his family no one is really developed. So I couldn't really connect to the characters. For example, Robert Pattinson's character is a large part of the story, but do you know much about him? Not really.The movie does have this character arc for the lead and I liked that, but I still feel it was a bit overlong. Not all of it felt really necessary, but there were some really emotional moments with the characters that actually were developed and those at least felt kinda earned.While it can get interesting, it's sluggish pace and some flat characters make it less exciting than it should have been. But there are also some beautiful moments that make up for it.",7,0,0,10 October 2017
Captain America: The First Avenger," Warming up for The Avengers
","Captain America:The First Avenger is the fifth movie in the MCU franchise and it's a bridge to the final movie in Phase One of MCU, the one five movies have been building up to, The Avengers.This movie is slightly above average, but it's still nothing remarkable. It's fun, it's very good looking and they nailed the retro feeling. The casting of the hero is perfect once again and Chris Evans plays the role very believable and at the beginning of the movie, when Steve Rogers a.k.a. Captain America is still all tiny and skinny, I couldn't believe it. It looked so realistic and then suddenly he's huge, but it looked so believable I didn't suspect it for a second. Hugo Weaving is as good as he is in any other villain role and we all know he plays those quite often. And there is also a slight connection to Thor, the Tesseract. And it all just builds up to The Avengers and this movie is probably ignored by many because by that moment people just wanted the avengers to assemble already. And also, one more thing about this movie is that if you're not familiar with the comics, there is a big plot twist waiting for you at the end.This movie is fine, it doesn't really have much flaws in my opinion, but it's just nothing impressive really. I don't even have much to talk about this one, so I guess that proves it.",7,0,2,28 June 2016
Baby Driver," A unique, stylish bomb
","Baby Driver is a movie about a young getaway driver who listens to music on his earphones almost all day, every day because it reduces the buzzing in his ears caused by a childhood accident. It's directed by Edgar Wright and stars Ansel Elgort, Lily James, Joe Bernthal and Jamie Foxx.From the very beginning, I could tell this was gonna be something fun and I ended up having a blast with this movie. The way the scenes match the music makes it almost feel like an action musical and it's truly refreshing to see, especially with such hypnotic action. At the same time, you can tell how much heart is put into this film. It seems like everything was done with so much care and everyone is enjoying what they're doing. And it sure is an enjoyable experience, this is one of the coolest movies recently and one of the most re-watchable this year. Every actor is great on their own, the story brings a familiar premise in a new way, the direction twists it further and the soundtrack is great. The pacing is even and while it does occasionally slow down, it's not felt, I was entertained every second.I have nothing but words of praise for this movie and I'm happy to say it's one of my favorites of the year. With it's blood-pumping action and a stylish direction, it's a good time guaranteed.",10,0,5,27 November 2017
Justice League," It is a let-down, but still judged a bit too harshly
","Justice League is the 5th DCEU movie and all four of the previous ones were building up to this one (and it should have been more). So much set-up in the previous movies and did it pay off? No, it didn't. But is it bad? Definitely not.First, let's talk a bit about the history of DCEU. Unpopular opinion here, I liked all DCEU movies so far (yes, even Suicide Squad, I'm gonna get so much hate for this), but I do realize it's very flawed and could have been done a lot better. Almost every movie was a missed potential, including this one. The main problem is that Warner Bros. worries too much and listens to criticisms more than it should. There's nothing wrong with listening criticisms, actually it can be a great thing, but WB gets very confused about them. Man of Steel worked okay, aside from some lack of development and a bit awkward pacing, I thought it worked. BvS was damaged by the editing. Of course there were more flaws like an overstuffed script with too much set-up and some scenes that had good ideas, but poorly executed. Maybe it could have been glossed over easily if they didn't cut it down so much. The extended version isn't perfect, but it's an improvement (even though the theatrical version wasn't as horrible as everyone was saying, it had style, it had ideas, it was different and was a spectacle). But that was supposed to be the movie to release. Then they panicked and listened to some really unfair criticisms about it being too dark. Not every movie has to be an action comedy, we have Marvel for that. And that led to crippling Suicide Squad. I still think it's entertaining and I like it for all it's flashy fun. I just had such an amazing time with it, I just couldn't hate it. Even though I see its flaws, but they didn't ruin it for me. Wonder Woman was finally, a success, so there was a lot of hope here. Aaand it feel a bit flat on its face.It's not bad, just slightly above average. It provides some epic moments, but it falls into mediocrity, because WB got afraid of making risks. They cut it down, so it's not overlong, but it only ended up feeling incomplete. Long doesn't necessarily make for overlong. So it all feels very rushed and at times like you missed a few scenes, even though you didn't. Humor was hit-and-miss (miss more often than hit), so injecting that much humor and copying Marvel was a really, really bad idea. Some is okay, sure, but don't make it feel so forced. The characters are very underdeveloped, if they didn't want to introduce them in their own movies, then give them more time in this one. These are just some really bad creative decisions. Another thing DCEU surprisingly doesn't nail at all is the villains (even though I'm in the minority who liked Jared Leto's Joker), as much as DC usually does. And Steppenwolf is the worst of them all. He's a CGI abomination who looks like he wandered in here from some PS3 game. He looks as bad as Incubus, but he's an even lamer character. There's barely a motivation, just a typical power- hungry alien and actually, you barely notice him. There's not one redeemable quality. Not one.Now let's get to the positives. It's very fun and has some really epic moments that show what could have been. The actors fit their roles, the characters as underdeveloped as they may sometimes seem, are okay presented and each one has something to do or some unique quality to them. The plot is a lot more clear and cohesive than BvS and only so slightly less thin than The Avengers. And has some gorgeously shot moments with beautiful cinematography (Gotham City looks amazing). The score by Danny Elfman is a bit forgettable, but has some surprising nods to some older DC scores. So, all in all, there are a lot of cons, but I think the pros outweigh them. Once again, a DC movie is judged to harshly. It's not great, and it's definitely ruined by the studio, but it's entertaining and considering how production went, it could have been worse.",7,2,4,21 November 2017
Man of Steel," Okay start to DC Cinematic Universe, but it could've been better
","Considering I like DC a little bit more than Marvel (but I still really like Marvel), my expectations were pretty high. I don't read DC and Marvel comics, but I really enjoy watching movies and TV shows or even playing video games based on their comics. I've seen all the previous Superman movies and I probably liked Superman II the most, and close to it is Superman Returns which I consider really underrated. This one is also somewhere in my top 3 with those 2, but I don't know exactly where. The movie is pretty good, but I kept feeling like they could do much more with this.Many talented people worked on this film and Henry Cavill is the most perfect Superman ever. I doubt there will ever be anyone better than him. He looks like Superman and he also gave a great performance. The characters feel much more human in this movie than the previous ones. While they could use a bit more character development, there is at least a little bit more of that now. Many people complained about the movie being too dark and too serious, but to me that was a very good aspect of the film and one of the main reasons I liked this movie. Who says superhero movies can't be taken seriously? I think it worked great and if it wasn't dark, people would probably complain that it's ripping off Marvel. They always have to complain about something. And also, the score is amazing and while this is an unpopular opinion, I liked it even more than the one from the old movies. That one is a perfect superhero theme, but this one takes it to another level. Just listen to the track called 'Ideal of Hope' from this movie and I guess you will understand what I'm talking about.Okay, those were the pros. Now the cons. The story and pacing hurt this movie the most. The story is kind of like the first two Superman movies combined in one story. Just even more simple. Many scenes are very well done, but the story is just too simple. It should have been something new, something bigger, but instead there is Zod again (and this version is really annoying). And also, the pacing is all over the place. Mostly because of the flashbacks that are all over the place. And the climax was overlong and too explosive. There is just so much unnecessary destruction. The CGI is great, don't get me wrong, but the whole third act is a little bit too much.This movie is pretty good, but they could do much more with this and I hope the DC Cinematic Universe ends up being great. I'm still pretty much positive because this is just the first movie and they can easily fix the flaws.",8,0,1,5 March 2016
Split," For two hours, you will forget how to breathe
","Split is a film directed by M. Night Shyamalan. It stars James McAvoy as this man with 23 personalities who kidnaps these young girls and they try to escape. Shyamalan's career is quite a story. With his first few movies ('The Sixth Sense', 'Unbreakable'...), he was hailed as the new Spielberg and had a bright future. Then, all of the sudden, he starts releasing some bad, bad movies ('The Happening', 'The Last Airbender'...). Then he redeemed himself with 2015's The Visit which was quite a refreshing thing for the found footage genre and it took everyone by surprise. That gave a bit more hope for this one when it was getting released. And now we can finally safely say that Shyamalan is back on track!I've always liked Shyamalan as a director. He had some horrible movies, but still, he was one of the only ones who mostly had original stories and ideas with movies and that alone makes me respect him. I expected this to be good, but it took me off guards. It's his best since 'The Sixth Sense' and I'd even go as far to say that it's even better. It has a small opening scene and then it throws you straight into action to assure that you're following. Then, after that, you get to know the backstories and characters little by little. And each new reveal, pumps up the anxiety of this film. From the first few minutes, Shyamalan assures that he has our attention and the feeling of uneasiness grows throughout the movie. Visually, the film looks beautiful and cinematography is fantastic. But even though everything impressed me about this film, there's one more particular thing that blew me away and that's James McAvoy. He has to get recognition on the next awards season. It would be a crime if he got snubbed. Let's just hope he doesn't get overshadowed by someone who got a certain accent right or who perfectly portrayed a mental breakdown in one scene because McAvoy does it all here. He was incredible and boosted up the creepiness in some scenes. The rest of the cast is pretty good too, but all of them are overshadowed by McAvoy. And also, you might know Shyamalan is known for twist endings. Trust me, you WON'T see this one coming.I have no flaws with this film. I loved absolutely everything about it. It's for now my favorite movie of 2017 and it's likely to stay that way. But, you never know.",10,5,16,20 April 2017
Divergent," Give it a chance. It's actually really good.
","Many people call this a rip-off of The Hunger Games and complain about it all the time. But hey, The Hunger Games is a rip-off of Battle Royale, so what? It's still pretty good. And is this good? Yes.This movie has more haters than it deserves. It may be long, but it's still fun. The story is OK but nothing outstandingly original. But it's still pretty interesting. The acting is decent. Nothing amazing, but nothing bad. Miles Teller is probably the best in his role. I'm not a huge fan of the books. The first book is the only one I really liked, the second one was decent, but the third one was a mess. And that spin-off about Four's character wasn't anything special either, but I really like the first book and I really like this movie. It's a pretty faithful adaptation and those who liked the book will be satisfied, I can guarantee it. It's very well done and it doesn't have that much of The Hunger Games vibe because it's less depressing and doesn't take itself so seriously, which is probably a good thing in this case. And one more good thing about it, the ending of the book isn't changed a lot but it's made to feel more complete and not a cliffhanger because that would be bad if the movie was a flop.This movie may get a lot of hate, but it's actually a really good movie. Is it a masterpiece? No. Not at all. But is it fun? Hell yeah! If you were planning to watch this movie, do it, it's not incredible but you won't waste your time.",9,0,1,11 March 2016
Dunkirk," And I thought Split was the most intense film of the year...
","Dunkirk is the 10th movie of one of the best directors of the generation, Christopher Nolan. That alone was a reason to get hyped about it. It's about a real life event in WW2, the Dunkirk evacuation. No character backgrounds, no specific interactions, just that event alone from three perspectives, the dock (one week), the sea (one day) and the air (one hour). And they are all shown in parallel.There is barely a character with at least some background, but still, Nolan somehow manages to create such intensity and anxiety, you will spend 100 minutes at the edge of your seat, barely breathing. One of the concern about a film was its PG-13 rating, but it doesn't even need it. It doesn't take only blood and gore to express the horrors of war. It can help, yes, but Nolan didn't need it. The performances were very good too. I was a bit skeptical about the casting of Harry Styles, but he gave one of the best performances in the movie. And there is also one more thing that helped build the anxiety, and that's Hans Zimmer's score. Of course, I expected no less from Hans Zimmer, but once again, he surprises with the always present clock-ticking noise that increases the sense of urgency. And when all that anxiety is over, it gives us some beautiful moments for the very end.With no blood and no character development, this incredibly shot film will keep you on the edge. Definitely worth a watch. My favorite movie of the year so far.",10,4,11,31 August 2017
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Turn the page 394.
","In my opinion, this is the best one in the series which is odd considering this is my least favorite book in the series (it's still awesome tho). Cuarón was probably the best director this franchise had and it's a shame that he directed only one movie in the series because he captured the magic perfectly. This one was even darker than the 2nd one and I remember how dementors freaked me out as a kid but it's still nothing compared to sequels. Young actors are much better this time, especially Radcliffe. He really surprised me. Watson and Grint did a really good job too. And there is so much new actors in this movie and ,oh my god, they were brilliant. Emma Thompson was hilarious as prof. Trelawney, Timothy Spall in role I'm not gonna mention because, spoilers, and, man, Gary Oldman did such a brilliant job as Sirius Black. Michael Gambon was really good as Dumbledore but still not as good as Richard Harris (R.I.P.) who really was Dumbledore from the book. The effects also look much more realistic in this one and the flight scene with a hipogriff was spectacular and remains one of my favorite scenes in the entire series. At the end, I must say that this is the best Harry Potter movie and one of my favorite movies ever!",10,1,2,31 August 2015
Get Out," One of the most original horror movies lately
","Get Out is Jordan Peele's directorial debut and it's about a young black man whose white girlfriend takes him to meet her parents. There is a lot racism going on and he starts getting more and more paranoid.I really can't describe the plot of this movie very well without spoiling too much and that's because of the one problem I have with this movie:awkward pacing. It's a bit of a slow-burn until the very end and then everything is resolved very quickly. It's still well-done and intense, yes, but the pacing makes the whole thing feel a bit off. There is also a comic relief character that was given way too much to do. He wasn't annoying, he was actually pretty funny, but his constant appearing gave us some way too sudden tonal shifts. Now while I'm saying all this, it probably sounds like I didn't like the movie, but I really did. I didn't think it was perfect, but it was an interesting ride.The premise itself is pretty smart, I just felt that more could be done with more psychological parts of the movie. Even though the plot structure isn't the best, the dialogues are very well written and backed up by very strong performances. Main character is well developed and you really care about him, which makes the whole situation even more intense. Through the first two acts, not much really happens, but you can't help but feel that sense of dread. Then things go down. Actually, it has a similar structure to The Wicker Man, just with a less disturbing ending.This movie has its flaws, but that didn't stop me from enjoying it because it won me over with an intense atmosphere and nail- biting climax.",9,10,19,19 July 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," It's very entertaining, very funny and visually impressive, but not much beyond that
","Pirates of the Caribbean:Dead Men Tell No Tales is a fifth movie in Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean series with Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush returning, but also some new stars Brenton Thwaites (The Giver, Maleficent) and Kaya Scodelario (The Maze Runner) and the great Javier Bardem as a lead villain Salazar.Just like every Pirates of the Caribbean movie, it's a good time guaranteed once again. It's a visual spectacle and it's full of witty dialogues and fun action sequences. The actors are clearly having a great time in their roles and it's a joy to watch them (even though Jack Sparrow is turning into a parody of himself), but all that put together didn't make for a memorable enough experience. It was fun, but not captivating enough. It's not one of those movies you will remember much when you get out of the theater. It's a good time while it lasts, but it won't stick with you. At least it wasn't as uninteresting as On Stranger Tides. And by the way, don't get too hyped up about that Paul McCartney role. He's in the movie for less than a minute and feels awfully shoehorned in. But maybe he will have a bigger role in the future. Still, I don't think he was necessary here, as much as I appreciate him.Yes, you will have fun, but you will forget about it eventually. It's still not as good as the first three movies in the series.",7,2,4,12 June 2017
Logan," The Wolverine we all waited for
","Logan is the 10th movie in the Fox Marvel Universe and the third and final movie in The Wolverine trilogy and also, sadly, the last time we see Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. But everything must come to an end. It's directed by James Mangold, the director of The Wolverine (2013) and is loosely based on a comic book story-line Old Man Logan.It's really sad to see Hugh Jackman leave this franchise. He didn't even look much like Wolverine from the comics, but he introduced Wolverine to the new wave of fans and his portrayal brought something new and something great to the role. And here, he offers the absolute best of this role. His young co-star Dafne Keen shows one of the best child acting I've seen lately. If you're a fan of Stranger Things, she will remind you a lot of Eleven. And Patrick Stewart also does the best for last. It's Xavier we've never seen before, but he's lovable.The movie is very gory and I love it. I'm glad to see that the R-rating trend is going strong. While MCU is generally better than this franchise, Fox takes risks and that's why I have respect for them. That makes this franchise more interesting. Also, the whole movie feels a lot like a western and I thought that kind of atmosphere fit very nicely with the story. I just have a few minor flaws. They didn't stop me from loving the movie, but I have to point them out. Someone will be bothered by them more than I was. An uninteresting villain and a bit of anti- climatic ending. But the fact that it was anti-climatic doesn't mean the emotional bar wasn't raised high. You will be getting a lot of feels here. I just expected more sense of closure, that it would go down a bit more epic. But this felt kinda realistic and like a lot bigger gut punch. You will see for yourself.For everyone who wanted a good, bloody and intense approach to Wolverine, here you go. But it can as well be enjoyed on its own.",10,2,7,27 April 2017
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Could've been better
",This is a good movie but it could've been so much better. The main problem is that it feels incredibly rushed. The book is the longest in the series but the movie is one of the shortest in the series. They cut out every subplot and some of the main plot too and it feels completely butchered but if you watch it on it's own it's okay. It's fun and it also has some really dark moments and the ending is heartbreaking. You will see it for yourself. The actors are great and Daniel Radcliffe is absolutely amazing and he became a great actor in this movie and continued to be great. But the new- comers were also great. Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood and Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge took my breath away and I don't think they could find actresses who would do those roles more perfect. You will hate Umbridge more than any other character in the series. Same with Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange. She's probably the most insane and psychotic character in the series. One more thing I can praise are the effects. Now it all looks completely believable and action sequences are eye candy and the climax is one of the most thrilling parts of the franchise. The movie was pretty good on it's own. Rushing was the thing that hurt this movie really bad but even if it's the weakest movie in the series it's still worth watching.,6,0,0,12 September 2015
Don't Breathe," Good, but kind of a let-down for me
","Don't Breathe is a second movie directed by Fede Alvarez, the director of the 2013 remake of Evil Dead. Evil Dead was surprisingly very good and a fresh take on a story while paying homage to the original. Knowing this is by the same director, it got me even more excited. It's about three young burglars who decide to rob a seemingly helpless blind old man. But they had no idea who they were messing with. So, did it live up to the expectations. I hate to say this, but not really. At least not mine.The movie isn't bad, it's another good twist on home invasion movies, it's got an amazing cinematography and sound design and Stephen Lang is terrifying as the villain of this movie. The problem is, it's not as intense as I hoped it would be. The movie itself is called 'Don't Breathe', and the trailers made it look like this man is something like freaking DareDevil. But no, he can't hear every breath in the house and he's just a regular blind man with some nice skills. I know it sounds kinda stupid to complain about villain not being a super-villain, but that's how the trailers showed it and it made the film lose the sense of paranoia to soon. After a half, I just kinda started losing interest and I never really felt like I was at the edge of my seat. It wasn't boring, that's for sure, but I expected some more anxiety and the villain being a bit more powerful.That's pretty much all I have to say about this movie. Everything else about it is solid, okay, but nothing remarkable. I'm not saying it's not worth watching, it has nice style to it, but if you decide to skip on it, you won't be missing anything special.",7,0,3,22 October 2016
Beauty and the Beast," I didn't want it to end.
","Beauty and the Beast is the fourth of the live- action Disney remakes after Maleficent (2014), Cinderella (2015) and The Jungle Book (2016). So far, I thought they were okay, but none of them impressed me. This one, however, did.The original might be my favorite Disney animated movie. I'm not sure, but definitely in the top 5. But I do have some sort of a connection with that one and when you go analyzing it has a lot of deeper and important messages. Like all Disney animated movies, the original was magical and I wondered if it would translate well on live-action. The previous three live-action remakes were alright, but they took away so many details that made the original so great in order to make it more realistic. But who cares about realistic in a fairy tale? Thankfully, this one kept the magic of the original and expanded the whole story in order to fill in some plot holes and it worked very well. I wasn't bored for a second. In fact, I just didn't want it to end. I was sucked into this beautiful, magical story and to this day I can't stop thinking about it. Especially since this story is so relate-able to me (I relate to Belle so, so much and I'm probably not the only one). I just got sucked into the magic and I never let it go. And the musical numbers only added fuel to the magic.The actors really got into their roles. I was really happy to see Emma Watson in this role since she's pretty much the heroine of my childhood (I grew up with Harry Potter) and I think she did a really good job. Dan Stevens is also very good as Beast and I liked how they gave him a sarcastic side. But the one who truly steals the spotlight is Luke Evans as the main villain Gaston. He's disgusting and fabulous at the same time and I'm sure they couldn't cast a better actor for that role. Everyone is so into it, and it's wonderful to finally see that much heart put into a movie. CGI might not always be believable but that doesn't make the movie any less gorgeous. The story is well expanded. They kept to the story of the original while adding something new to it.All in all, I absolutely adore this movie and I'd even say that it's better than the original. There were a few times that I was close to tears of joy and I left with a big, big smile on my face. I will definitely be coming back to this one over and over again and I recommend this to everyone. I haven't felt this much magic in a movie since Harry Potter ended.",10,2,11,28 April 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," I'm surprised. This is my favorite MCU movie after Captain America:Civil War.
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a 15th movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Time flies, huh? With all bigger comic book movies coming out in 2017 I was actually the least hyped for this one. There were some reasons to worry. Usually when a sequel tries to outdo the original by going bigger, it turns into a mess. And I'm happy to say that wasn't the case with this one.The plot is actually rather straightforward but it's how it's done that matters here. The characters are all likable and well fleshed-out, the dialogue is witty and well-written (except for a few cringy jokes, but those tiny parts are easy to forget), the actors give their best in their roles and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing! First one was also entertaining, but it just didn't really feel as good as this one, you don't have that sense of a team and friendship in the first one because they were still introducing to each other and getting together. Here, the chemistry is real. And now that you know the characters, it's a lot easier to relate and feel for them. The emotions are strong with this one, trust me. Also, if you're looking for answers you didn't get in the first one, you will get them here. And finally, another great villain. Not forgettable like in many MCU movies.So, in short, I said everything I wanted about this movie. The plot may be simpler than the predecessor's but this one is so much more enjoyable, heartwarming and emotional. You will want to come back to this one more than the first one. At least I know I will.",10,7,12,20 May 2017
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Classic!
","The very beginning of a classic film franchise that many people (including me) call a big part of their childhood. When I was a kid, I loved this movie and watched it over and over again. I probably know all the lines in the movie. Then, when I was 14, I watched it again and this time, after reading the book (which is awesome, by the way) and while I enjoyed it as always because all the beautiful memories I get, I found some flaws. Most of them are about differences from the book but we can all say this part is one of the most faithful ones to the book. I will not say much about child actors considering that they were still unexperienced.Looking at them, I must say Emma Watson did the best job as Hermione Granger and Tom Felton was also really good as Draco Malfoy and he just makes you want to punch him in the face which is a good thing looking at his character. Now about adult actors. I think Maggie Smith did the best job as Harry's strict but awesome professor McGonagall. And I'll have to mention Alan Rickman that was really intimidating as professor Snape. I will not mention cast anymore because in my opinion everyone did good. Effects were fine for early 2000s but it doesn't look so good today. But there are some scenes that are still as thrilling as in 2001. But the most brilliant thing in this film is John Williams' beautiful score which totally brings me back to childhood and makes everything more magical. So, when you put everything together, it's a really entertaining fantasy every family should watch and the start of a great adventure.",7,0,1,31 August 2015
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Not really faithful as an adaptation but good on it's own
","The book was one of the best and most intense in the series and while I think they left out too much the movie was still epic. Dumbledore bothered me the most. I mean, what? When did Dumbledore get so hyperactive? Where did that wise, calm Dumbledore go? But, about the ending, they totally nailed it! This ending is a big game-changer in the series and when you see why, you'll be shocked. After that, nothing is going to be the same again. It's gut-punching and also terrifying for children. But enough about the ending, you'll see it for yourself. CGI is great and now it really looks realistic. The dragon and underwater scenes were spectacular! And don't get me started on the maze. There are also some teen problems in this movie. Obviously, they are not kids anymore but it's really fun to see them grow up. The Yulle Ball part shows that the most. About the actors, I can only say something about the new ones because the others are great as usual (except Gambon who wasn't bad but over the top). Brendan Gleeson is great as Mad-Eye Moody. And David Tennat was scary in a good way. John Williams isn't the composer anymore but Patrick Doyle did such a great job in this one. While Williams' score was more magical, Doyle's was pure epicness and makes everything more intense. And Mike Newell, as a first British director in the franchise was great. While it could've been more faithful to the book (but then it would be really long) it's still awesome and epic.",9,1,3,1 September 2015
Thor," OK, but they could do more with this
","Thor is the fourth MCU movie, coming after Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2. It's about gods, so you would think this would be incredibly epic, but it's not really. The story doesn't feel big at all and barely affects anything, so it feels like it only exists to introduce us to the character.It's not bad, it's enjoyable, it's entertaining, well shot, visually pretty impressive, pretty funny at times and they nailed the casting once again. Chris Hemsworth is a perfect choice for Thor just like Robert Downey Jr. for Iron Man. But the one who really stole the show for me is Tom Hiddleston as his brother Loki. He is the best villain MCU ever had so far and I think it will remain that way. He fits the role perfectly and he also seems to have a lot of fun playing it. Kenneth Branagh is the director this time and this is probably one of the most well directed MCU movies. Also, visually the movie is beautiful, one of the best looking MCU movies. So, what went wrong? Once again, I'm saying the movie is pretty okay, but this isn't supposed to be just okay. I think they could have done a lot more with the story. It has a good character arc and everything, but it just doesn't feel big. Even tho there were some emotional parts, it still just doesn't help. It remains just kinda okay, but nothing more. And there should have been more. This way it feels like this movie's only purpose is to introduce us to some new characters and it shouldn't be that way. And while the movie is well done and everything, it's just not as good as it can be.",7,0,2,28 June 2016
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," The most underrated movie in the series
","I don't know if it's because I watched this one first when I was 7 and it's the reason I fell in love with the series or because this one was the most faithful adaptation, not only in the series, probably one of the most faithful adaptations ever. Child actors are a little older (and better) in this movie, the atmosphere is really magical and adult actors as great as always and I don't even have to say anything about the score. This one is probably my 2nd favorite movie in the series. Effects look a bit fake at some parts but aside from that, everything was perfect. When I saw the first movie after reading a book, I liked it, but it felt kinda rushed. In this one, everything was great. It had all plot elements from the book (I think), it was darker, more thrilling but this one may scare the children a little (boo, spiders!). From new actors in the series, I was overwhelmed by Kenneth Branagh as a new arrogant professor Gilderoy Lockhart and some of his scenes still make me laugh out load. Not only him, but Shirley Henderson as Moaning Myrtle too. All in all, this is a really enjoyable fantasy and one of the most faithful adaptations ever.",10,1,2,31 August 2015
Kong: Skull Island," Turn your brain off and enjoy the ride
","Kong:Skull Island is the second movie in a new rebooted Universal monsters universe, the first being Godzilla (2014). I loved Godzilla and I think I loved this one even more.Everyone says that the movie is bad because most characters are one-dimensional and you don't care about them. That's true. But look, why would you want to know all of the human characters backstories and feelings when you're watching a freaking monster movie? People today are forgetting how to enjoy movies. Not everything should be watched by the same standards. It's kinda like criticizing Moonlight for not being funny and you decided to watch it as a comedy. Think about it, there's really not much difference. Unfortunately, it's starting to look like every movie today is being criticized for not being funny, but whatever. The characters might have been bland, but that doesn't make the movie any less intense. And trust me, it's INTENSE. There are quite a few scenes that will make you anxious especially if you're afraid of bugs or lizards. It's also surprisingly very gory for a PG-13 movie. I was very pleasantly surprised. It's not the PG- 13 'violence' that you see in movies all the time lately. This movie is shockingly brutal and one of those that push the PG-13 rating to the limits. And Kong. Wow. Kong has never been this bada$$. Seriously, he's so freaking cool and the design of other monsters is quite good.All in all, when I put it all together, I suggest that you turn your brain off and let yourself be entertained. If you like movies about giant monsters, you will love this.",10,5,9,27 April 2017
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," This one is actually great!
","The first two movies in the prequel trilogy weren't horrible, but had so many flaws. This one isn't as good as any movie in the original trilogy, but if you ask me it's pretty close. This one is actually very well done and special effects don't look so fake now and give us some really epic scenes, especially in a movie's climax that will keep you at the edge of your seat. Here, George Lucas proved that he can still do it and I was really satisfied with this movie. The acting was the best the prequel trilogy gave and Hayden Christensen isn't so wooden and annoying anymore. Here he's actually pretty cool and shows that he has potential, but Ewan McGregor remains the best part of the cast. You really believe him to be young Obi-Wan and that's very well done and he also has some very heartbreaking moments with Anakin at the end. One of the biggest flaws in the prequels was all those political conversations. Just lots and lots and lots of talking that makes you want to fall asleep, but thankfully, Lucas listened to his fans and it's reduced here. It's still present, of course, but not as much. Romance between Padme and Anakin is a little bit more believable here, but still not enough and that's one of the biggest flaws here, but the blame is more on Attack of the Clones in this case. Everything is executed very well and leading up to the original trilogy is very good, even tho it does create some plot holes, but in Star Wars you can explain almost everything with the Force. And one more good thing for Jar Jar haters, he appears for only like, a second. Hooray! But there is one more thing they messed up in the ending and I'm not gonna spoil anything but that one awful line (NOOOO!). While the first two movies in the prequel trilogy were disappointing, this one makes it all better. Not everyone will like it, but as a big Star Wars fan, I must say it's a nice and intense ending for the prequels.",9,83,96,27 December 2015
The Big Short," Good movie, but don't watch if you have zero interest in economy
","First time I saw this movie, I didn't understand anything at all. Maybe a little bit. On the second viewing I understood it much better, but I had to be fully concentrated.I'm not interested in economy so I don't know much about it, but on the second viewing I even got more informed about it. The acting is maybe the best thing about this movie and while Christian Bale got nominated, I think Steve Carrel's performance was the best. Gosling was great too but Bale and Carrel were batter. I had no idea Carrel is such a good actor and I was really surprised about him. And the movie is also very well written. It dumbs everything down which really helps if you don't understand what are the characters talking about. Ot doesn't hurt the story at all because it's done in such a clever way to explain to the audience and I really liked that. And also pacing is really fast so if you understand what's going on, you won't be bored.At the second viewing I realized that this is a very good movie, but it's still on the 7th place on my list of this year's Oscar nominees ranked (the 8th one being Spotlight). But if you are not into economy and you want to watch this movie, get informed about it first because otherwise you will barely understand anything.",8,1,2,20 February 2016
Wonder Woman," Indeed, one of DC's best
","Wonder Woman is the fourth movie in the DCEU and the first time the character of Wonder Woman (a.k.a. Diana Prince) gets her own live-action movie. There were reasons to worry. DCEU has had three chances and they blew each one, why would this be different? Well, it just is. They actually put their heart in this one.Even though this is coming from a person who liked all the previous DCEU movies (don't judge me), this is well worth your time. I didn't really find many big flaws and I'm aware of the flaws that the previous DCEU movies had. They just didn't bother me so much. The dialogues are fun and at times hilarious. Seriously, the first half is quite funny. But the too sudden tonal shift may bother some viewers a little because the first and the second half almost feel like two different movies. But they are both equally heartfelt and enjoyable. They just should have been put together a bit better. But it still works and delivers on the action, emotion and entertainment. Think first half Marvel, second half DC. But both at their best. The first half is funny, entertaining, mostly lighthearted and is a good set-up for what's to come. The second half goes a bit darker, but it's not Batman v Superman level of dark, there are still occasional bursts of happiness (there is one gorgeous dance scene). Still, even though it's dark, it's hopeful and gives a lot more depth to the movie with its themes. From a visual perspective, it's alright. The CGI could be better, but it's okay, some might be bothered by the overuse of slow motion, but I was cool with it. But, everyone who didn't like the bleak colors of the previous DCEU movies, than this is your cup of tea and it helps lift up the atmosphere into something more hopeful. Gal Gadot is beautiful, charismatic and perfect for Wonder Woman, she just felt so natural. And Chris Pine is at his best for now. Sometimes a great comic relief, sometimes just a very strong character. Another thing I really liked about this is how it shows tolerance. Usually with this kind of movie, you would expect massive feminism, looking at men from above etc. But this movie really doesn't do that. It's equal to everyone and that's one of the main reasons I love it. It shows tolerance.Overall, this is a very uplifting, entertaining and heartfelt film which was just what DC needed. Warner Bros. finally let things happen the way they should and it turned out wonderful.",10,11,28,7 June 2017
Fifty Shades of Grey," Not completely awful, just kinda lame
","After hilarity Jupiter Ascending was, we get these few weeks later. This movie isn't as horrible as Jupiter Ascending, but it's far from being good. But still, what would you expect from an even more hilarious book?I'll admit, the trailers were pretty good with a cool soundtrack and it actually looked promising and exciting in some parts, but no. There are 5 or 6, I can't remember, really short sex scenes with really toned down nudity and no one will be satisfied with them. For guys, Dakota Johnson just isn't attractive enough and for girls, they won't see Jamie Dornan's junk and end up being disappointing. I'm aware that this isn't a porno and wasn't supposed to be, but it could be a little more juicy because that's kinda the reason everyone went to see this movie and regretted it. The plot is very faithful to the book and considering that nothing really interesting happens in the first book aside from all that sex, this movie will probably be boring to you. But, like Jupiter Ascending, you can watch it with your friends and laugh at it. The cringe-worthy acting and writing are so bad it's hilarious. Okay, the actors weren't THAT horrible. They did what they could, but the script was awful and that's the main problem. The blame for that is probably on E.L. James because she was given too much freedom on set and you could even say it was written and directed by her.Sam Taylor Johnson did a decent job as far as she could and the movie is actually very well shot and the soundtrack and score fit the movie very well. But, Danny Elfman, what are you doing here? You deserve so much movies that are better than this. They must have promised him a lot of money. But at least he gave the movie one more positive side.I'm not calling this movie a complete garbage, it does have very few good sides, but it's still fun when you watch it with your friends and laugh your a*s off, but it's just lame. Maybe the sequel will be better and less embarrassing because more stuff happens and everything, but we will see.",4,1,2,3 January 2016
Iron Man," A movie that started an evolution of movie franchises.
","This is probably one of the most important superhero movies because it launched a franchise that would inspire a lot of other franchises to expand to cinematic universes. This started MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe).If not the first cinematic universe, it's definitely the one that popularized the idea. But through the movie it doesn't even seem like it's setting up something big and that's why the story has space to breathe which is a great thing. It has a lesser- known Marvel hero because Marvel has sold out their most popular heroes at that time. Spider-Man to Sony, X-Men and Fantastic Four to Fox etc. It also stars Robert Downey Jr., who sank really deep down at that time so there wasn't as much of a possibility for this movie to succeed, but they definitely tried and when the movie came out, the tables were turned. Robert Downey Jr. redeemed himself as the charismatic and witty scientist Tony Stark. He shines in the role and it seems like it was created just for him and no one else because trust me, after him, you will never be able to see anyone else as Tony Stark. The plot is typical for a superhero origin movie, but it's done in such a good way that it keeps you very interested. Jeff Bridges is very good as the villain in this movie and he's the second biggest star of the movie. After Downey, of course. It does include a little bit of foreshadowing, but it's nothing to distract you from the plot and those who are not familiar with the source material won't even notice it. But the post-credit scene shows us the biggest purpose of this movie, it shows us that it's just a start of something bigger and the post- credit scene is MCU's big bang moment.Not many people expected this movie to be this much of a success. It has everything necessary:it's entertaining, it has good performances and visuals, it has a charismatic main character who is also a different kind of superhero and, the most important thing, it launches a franchises that won't just change superhero movies, but franchises themselves.",10,0,1,26 June 2016
Mother!," It came from 1 to 10 for me in the matter of hours. That's how strange it is.
","mother! is a new movie by a visionary director Darren Aranofsky (Requiem for a Dream, Noah, Black Swan) who has never shied away from shocking the audiences and causing controversy. That's why I think he's one of the most interesting directors working today and his films are always talked about when they come out, doesn't matter if they bomb or not. It starts Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem as this couple living alone isolated from the world in this house and then some people come up and ruin their peace.I'm not gonna say anything else about the plot because it's just so much and it's hard to describe, so the less said the better. I gotta say this is quite possibly the most unique movie experience I have ever had. Before I start talking about the movie itself let me tell you a story about how I watched it in order to make some points about it. I knew this was going to be something else, but I didn't expect it to disturb me this much. I'm not one of those who get scared by movies. Some rare ones did scare me, but not much. And this is not your usual kind of fear. This is just pure uneasiness and disturbance. First half is interesting. Now that I reflect upon it, I remember how easily I got sucked into this nightmarish world. I just got lost in the movie. Then the third act came up and all hell broke loose. And when I say hell, I do mean hell. Pure, nightmarish chaos. And being an ambivert, it really was a nightmare for me. And I could only imagine what it must be like for introverts. I've also seen it in the middle of the week and at the end of a busy day, so that might have affected the way I saw it. But you can have the most wonderful day and this movie will still disturb you deeply. And close to the end there was one particular scene that was just too much and me and my friend walked out feeling sick and I was in a state of a small shock through the rest of the night. That night, and in the morning, I hated this movie with all my heart and soul and wanted to give it a 1/10. But what extremely bothered me is that I couldn't stop thinking about how well everything works in it. I spoiled the rest for myself on Wikipedia and then managed to somehow watch the last 10 minutes online. And now I think it's one of the best movies of the year.This is a masterpiece. This is Darren Aronofsky's Mona Lisa. I still can't stop thinking about this movie. It's symbols, allegories, plot and directing. It's masterfully directed. A constant use of close-up will make you feel slightly harassed after a while and it certainly adds fuel to the feeling of unease. And the third act is the best depiction of chaos, nightmare and hell I've ever seen on film. At first I thought I never wanna watch it again. Now I think I'm gonna watch it quite often when it comes out on blu-ray. It's a horrifying masterpiece that is also backed up by extremely strong performances by absolutely everyone starring in this movie. Horror is term used so easily today with horror movies, but this was true horror for me. I loved it. Like a poem, it's full of metaphors and there are so much ways to interpret this and there is almost no way to literally interpret this. But it's beautiful and chaotic at the same time.Wow, I don't remember the last time I've FELT a movie this intensely and I don't remember the last time a movie stuck with me so much. It made such an impact on me and I certainly don't remember hating this movie and loving it not even a day later. It jumped from being my least favorite movie of the year to maybe even being my favorite movie of the year. If not that, definitely one of my favorites. Just don't watch if you're weak at disturbing movies, you might get traumatized.",10,1,5,27 October 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Much better than the critics say it is
","As much as I love both DC and Marvel, I love DC a little bit more and I was super excited about how DC Extended Universe would turn out. Man of Steel was the first movie in the universe, but this one really starts it all. Man of Steel was a start, but it was left a stand-alone movie just in case it fails.Man of Steel was pretty good, but it could've been better, but this is actually much better. I loved it, but there are some flaws, I will talk about them first. Scenes that are setting up the Justice League feel really out of place and I think that the whole Justice League thing should have been placed at the very end of the movie, including the files about the members because that part was so awesome, it would be a pity not to include it. Just not in the middle of the movie because it distracts you from the main story. And also, there are some plot holes and some subplots that just show up and disappear, and I think Wonder Woman should have been featured more throughout the movie and be in the main plot about Batman v Superman because this way, when she appeared it felt a little bit out of place and no one was like 'Who is she?'. And also, there are so many dream sequences, I think the movie would work well without them. Jesse Eisenberg is kinda annoying as Lex Luthor, but he seems to have so much fun playing the role, for me it was so much fun to watch him.Now the good stuff. The action is fantastic. The visuals are absolutely amazing. It was incredible. The fight between Batman and Superman wasn't as long as some people expected, but it was breathtaking. And I'm so glad Ben Affleck proved all the haters wrong. I never really saw what's so bad about him playing Batman. I had faith in him from the start. And now I can tell everyone that I was right. And Jeremy Irons is the most awesome Alfred we could possibly get. And while setting up the future movies should have been reduced, it was really exciting to see the parts that did that.This movie is flawed, I understand that. The plot is a little messy, but that doesn't ruin the absolute spectacle this movie is! Now I'm even more excited for DCEU. I recommend you to go watch it in the cinema, it's an incredible experience and you won't regret seeing it at least for the visuals.",9,13,24,2 April 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Great comeback!
","What a hype! And it actually payed off. This movie turned out to be absolutely worth the wait. There are some flaws of course, but not every movie can be like The Empire Strikes Back. I personally got exactly what I was expecting from this movie. Great, but still, not better than the original trilogy.J.J. Abrams is directing this one and I had a lot of faith in him because I loved his Star Trek and Super 8 was pretty good too. I find it great that they decided to give young talents a chance. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and J.J. Abrams himself. And they all did a great job! No matter about my first expectations, the closer the release was, the more hyped I was!Now, more about the movie itself. The effects are great! Star Wars is back and it has never looked so good! The characters are very well fleshed out and you really care about them. The score is beautiful as always. John Williams is a genius! The script is also very good and dialogues aren't cringeworthy like they used to be in the prequels. The combination of the old and the new is perfect and there is just enough nostalgia, but not too much.Some people say plot is just a rehash of A New Hope, but there is also some of The Empire Strikes Back, and I'm perfectly fine with that. The only problem I have is that I feel like Disney marvelised it a little, and few times I felt like I'm watching Guardians of the Galaxy, but there still was that classic Star Wars feel too and one more thing that was very well done is that one big reveal at the end. So emotional and the beautiful score, oh my god! The only problem is that it ends too soon, but it totally leaves you waiting to see more.While this wasn't the best Star Wars movie, it's a great new start for the series and I'm looking forward to the sequels and spin-offs!",9,6,22,30 December 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Incredible!
","The first one was very good but this one blew me away! Catching Fire is my favorite book in the series and one of my favorite books ever so I had even higher hopes for this one and I was not disappointed. This one is also very faithful to the source material and that is very good. Actors are as great as always and the story is much more intense now. While Ross' directing was good in the first one and gave a more realistic feel, I prefer the new director, Francis Lawrence. Everything looks better and it feels like a much bigger thing and there are also some very good shots. The visuals are stunning and the arena part is very well done and will keep you at the edge of your seat. Some people will complain that the first half is slow, but it's really important in building up the second half. You get to know all the consequences left by the previous one and look deeper in Capitol and rebellion. The second half is when things start to really move. Rebellion becomes bigger and bigger, we meet some new characters and then it becomes non-stop action. Then there's the twist ending that will totally leave you hanging and you will really want to know what happens next. If you liked the first one, you will love this one!",10,2,7,18 November 2015
Life," Starts of good enough, but turns as bland and generic as possible
","Life is a movie about a group of astronauts who find a life on Mars and examine it on their ship. The life form named Calvin, eventually grows, escapes and starts killing everybody.It had potential to be interesting, and it was for the first 30 minutes or something. It looked like it was setting up something and fleshing out, but ends up killing off all of the well-developed characters and living us with the blandest ones. And, developed or not, everyone is stupid. I'm talking Prometheus level of stupid, if not more. Only that was a way better and more creative movie. This turns out to be such an illogical, clichéd and generic experience. It's clearly one of those movies you forget about the next day. The end was at least surprising, but the twist felt a bit unearned when the shock wore off.I don't even know what to say about this movie anymore. There's really not much to talk about. It's quite possibly the biggest 'meh' of the year.",5,2,4,15 September 2017
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A timeless classic
","A New Hope is one of those movies that will never be forgotten and will be watched over and over again and never get old. It's beautifully shot, the use of practical effects is breathtaking and everything feels realistic. That's the best thing of the entire movie and not just entire movie, probably the best thing of the entire original trilogy. Characters are relatable, but it just feels like they are not fleshed out enough, but more of that will come in the sequels. While I really like this movie, I don't consider it a masterpiece mostly for the reason I said in the previous sentence. There are just good guys and bad guys. I know they have that charm, but it's just not enough to me. Now more about good sides, the movie isn't boring for one second. The action is very well done, the story is simple and it's perfect to relax. While some scenes are action-heavy, some of them are pure beauty (the double sunset scene is one of my favorites in the series and also one of the most iconic). And what I like the most is what a universe it establishes in just 2 hours and is yet to be expanded in the sequels. Usually big universes like this are made in books or TV shows, at least successfully, but they made such a huge one in just few movies and expanded it with animated series and comics. Back in 1977, before the release, who could expect this would become such an iconic, timeless and immortal franchise. No one took this seriously on shooting except George Lucas and few more people. The story of making this movie, inspires me very much and makes me believe that even when you're hopeless you can succeed in achieving what you want. And, just one more iconic thing that can't go unmentioned is John Williams' brilliant score and after watching a movie you will catch yourself humming one of the tracks from the score. While this movie has flaws, it's still a classic that will never be forgotten.",9,1,2,19 December 2015
Deadpool," The best superhero movie after The Dark Knight
","2016 is a year full of blockbusters and comic book movies. Marvel and DC are the most popular here and they are both preparing spectacles for this year. This is the first one out of six. But I wasn't as excited about this movie as much as I was about Suicide Squad, Batman v Superman, Civil War and even X-Men:Apocalypse. I expected this movie to be pretty good but I wasn't super excited. And when I came out of the theater, I was blown away! This is the best superhero movie after The Dark Knight and the best Marvel movie.After awful Fantastic Four reboot, Fox kinda got a bad rap, but they totally knew what they were doing with this one. Screenplay is just awesome and I hope it gets nominated at the next year Academy Awards. It's full of clever 4th wall breaks and hilarious lines. Ryan Reynolds fits the role perfectly and fans have nothing to be afraid of. We already saw him in X-Men Origins:Wolverine, but he was criminally underused there and butchered to the point that at the end of the movie he was no longer Deadpool. Thankfully, it doesn't happen here, and why would it? It would be absurd if they did that in his own movie. The villain is a great challenge to Deadpool and is played perfectly. An R rating also helped the movie a lot and if it was toned down, it just wouldn't be as great as it is this way and it would butcher the character once again, so it was a very wise decision to have an R rating.This was one of my least anticipated superhero movies this year, but it will probably end up being the best and I doubt any of the others will top this. It's so much fun and you won't be bored for a second and it's very well written. And also, if you're a parent, don't bring your kid if it's younger than 13 or anyone who can't bear violence.",10,5,14,15 February 2016
John Wick: Chapter 2," Stahelski took the style of the first one and boosted it up to 100%
","John Wick:Chapter 2 is a sequel to a 2014 movie John Wick which stars Keanu Reeves as a titular assassin who tries to live a normal life, but his past comes back to haunt him.The first one was a big surprise for me, I loved it. The plot was simple, but it worked. But the style is what made the movie. It was the most comic-booky movie that year that wasn't even based on a comic book. It's the same case here. The plot isn't much, actually it was even better in the first one, but the style is what makes this movie stand out. I tend to be very forgiving on style over substance, but it's not like there's no substance at all. The story is in it's place (except for one surprise cameo of a certain actor I'm not gonna mention since it's a bit spoilerish, but it feels kinda shoehorned in) and it gives us more. It shows us more of this world in a more detailed way. Something every sequel should do. But again this movie isn't so praised for its substance. It's praised for its style. And it has every right to be. What you saw in the first one (especially the club scene from the first one) was just a taste of what you will see in this one.This is a perfect example of what a great sequel should be. Upgrade upon the first one, go bigger and better, while not turning into a mess. Now I hope the third one is also as great as the first two and this will be one of my favorite trilogies ever.",10,6,11,19 June 2017
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," One of the best movies of all time and the best in the saga!
","A New Hope was a very good movie, but something was missing. The plot wasn't the best, the characters could've been more fleshed out, but this movie has everything. It's one of those that are absolutely perfect. The acting, the effects, directing, plot, everything was just perfect. The acting is great and these characters were already likable in the previous movie, but here there is much more chemistry between them, they feel like they are real and you care about them much, much more. George Lucas isn't directing this time, but Irvin Kershner did a great job and directed the best Star Wars movie of all time! About the effects, I mostly think the same I thought about the previous movie. They are ahead of it's time, they aged well, and it was all practical, but it's so hard to believe. John Williams made a perfect score to the movie and here we are introduced to a theme of the Empire. There is especially that one unforgettable scene when that music plays and it fits perfectly. The plot is emotional, intense and that twist at the end will stick with you for a long time (of course, if someone didn't already spoil it to you). It's foreshadowing the next movie and sets it up in such a good way that it's impossible to top it. While the other movies have their flaws, this one is flawless and watchable over and over again. An absolute masterpiece!",10,1,2,22 December 2015
Alien: Covenant," Even though it may seem like a familiar formula, it's still quite intriguing
","Alien:Covenant is a sequel to 2012's Prometheus and another in a series of prequels to 1979's sci-fi horror classic Alien. It's not as much of a Prometheus sequel as it is the Alien prequel, but it's a very interesting watch.Like Alien and Prometheus, this was directed by Ridley Scott who once again brought us this franchise in the new light. Even though plot may seem a bit generic, there is still some kind of a new feel to it. I can't describe it. It's a bit of Prometheus and Alien, but at the same time it's neither Prometheus nor Alien. I suggest you go into it with an open mind because whether you expect a Prometheus sequel or Alien prequel you will be a bit disappointed. It doesn't really give as much answers as we expected, since Prometheus is such an enigma of a movie (but that's what made it even better for me), but it does provide some. And that's where my main drawback with this film comes in. It tries to ignore events from Prometheus. Which is sad to see because even though not everyone will agree with me, Prometheus wasn't a mistake. Alien 3 and Alien:Resurrection were mistakes. Prometheus most certainly wasn't. Maybe some themes will be brought up again in the future films. I guess we will have to wait and see. But it resolves some plot points from Prometheus way too easily, like they just wanted to get it done, and it feels a bit lackluster-ish. Especially since Prometheus felt so grand and larger than life. Okay, I'm starting to mention Prometheus way too much, but I had to in order to explain my problem with this movie. Now let's get back to Alien:Covenant, shall we?Once again, it's visually gorgeous and while the main plot feels like we've seen it before, Ridley Scott makes it a unique experience once again. Katherine Waterson is pretty much a replacement for Sigourney Weaver, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, I think that's great. You probably won't see it that much in the movie's first third, but that's mostly used for building up. It's not the first time we've encountered the slow beginning in this franchise. Once things really get going, all hell breaks loose. It's intense, it's scary, it's creepy, I loved it! It was a hell of a ride and I can't wait for the next one now or at least see this one again.This felt refreshing and different from our usual blockbusters even though the plot could have been more original, but it's yet to be expanded in the next movies of the series. And that's safe to say since it still retained some of the themes from Prometheus even if it didn't answer all the questions in a satisfying manner. It made the movie deeper and more interesting and after this, I guarantee, you will want more.",9,38,74,20 May 2017
