Miracle," Really good
","I had a hard time understanding what was going on at first, but after a little bit it made sense. Herb (the coach) pushed the team till they were about to break but by doing that it forced the team to learn from each other. It made them a family and a great team. When they were playing against the Soviets it was very intense to watch. But I ultimately enjoyed it very much and I highly recommend this to anyone.",8,0,0,25 April 2019
Captain Phillips," Alright
","Without knowing the history it's a decent movie. The actors were great I love Tom Hanks and the majority of his roles. But a lot the scenes in the movie didn't actually happen, or in the way it was conducted. The scenes towards the end I think are because I would have a mental breakdown if that happened. Also I would never be completely alright. A fair amount of it is Hollywoodized but if you like that stuff you might enjoy this.",5,0,0,9 May 2019
42," 42 is my new favorite number
","I thought that you his movie was amazing to not just watch, but learn from. A scene that was small but powerful was when a white boy yelled profanities only because his dad was. It showed that the environment can create a less desireable character. The movie was about a baseball player named Jack 'Jackie' Robison. It showed his experience both on and off the field. As well as how deep the ignorance some people can stoop to. I didn't know anything about Jackie Robison other than he was a great ball player. I'm glad that I watched this to see how great of a person he was. Robison was able to turn the other cheek, despite attempts from couches and players trying to get a reaction. It makes me happy that at least a few of his teammates defended him when this happened. One of my favorite scenes from the movie is when one of the reporters said 'they have a longer heel bone, so that gives him an unfair speed advantage'. The second he said that, Robison hit a home run and the other reporters laughed at his statement. I have seen the main actor (Chadwick Boseman) in one other film called Black Panther and Harrison Ford in many others. I think both are very fine actors and can make a connection with the audience. I completely loved this movie and would watch it again if I had the chance. I really like the fact that they didn't sugar coat anything, they showed the reality of what was happening. I completely recommend it to all of my friends and any one who is thinks about watching it.",10,1,2,5 February 2019
Remember the Titans," Great movie
","I usually don't watch football movies, but this one in particular I thought was great. The movie wasn't just showing a game, it was showing a team coming together. When they desegregated the high school there was a struggle in the beginning. But during the football boot camp they were forced to come together. And doing so created not just a team but a family, many of the team members continued to be friends as well. Also when the team was winning game after game, it made the town look at themselves and what they were doing unto others.",10,0,1,11 April 2019
Hidden Figures," Loved it
","I think that this movie is amazing, I rewatched it a few times because it's that good. It's a history movie which I like about even more. The plot of the movie based off of historic figures in the NASA program. Specifically Katherine Johnson, Dorthy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson; theses women were geniuses in their field and made it possible for other African American women to be in important roles. Seeing this movie inspired me to do some more research on the three women. To me they were a force to reckoned with, because they wanted change to make it possible for everyone to be who they wanted. Other civil rights movement movies show the the unfairness of what was going on at the time. I appreciate that because the majority of these films don't sugar coat anything. My favorite scene of this film is an example of this. After coming back from the 'colored' bathroom, Kathrine Johnson's boss asks her why does it take so long. She replies that she had to go to the bathroom. She adds on that all of the bathrooms in a mile radius of the campus are 'white'. So she has to go across campus to relieve herself, she also says the rules are ridiculous saying that she can't even afford pearls. Because 'colored' people don't even get paid enough, she continues on venting her frustration on the staff that it doesn't help that they can't even refill a coffee pot because they are too afraid to touch it. This scene hit me really hard because I find what they are doing to her is very ridiculous. I was able to connect emotionally with the movie and I think that's important. I totally recommend it to anyone who is thinking about watching it, it's both entertaining and you do learn something.",10,0,4,7 March 2019
Selma," Very emotional movie
","I loved watching this movie, it really got me and I was able to connect with movie. One of the scenes that hit me hard was when they walked to the local court house, they were met with barricade of officers. they immediately went on their knees and put their hands behind their heads, but one of the elders struggled with this. So the sheriff decided to beat him because the man was being 'defiant'. This lead to a woman hitting the sheriff to get him to back off from the elderly man. It lead to total chaos and everyone getting hurt. That scene hit me really hard, because I can never understand that level of brutality. It was a great way to emotionally connect with the audience by making them feel empathetic for the characters, and being able to connect with them is really important to me. It helps me to 'become one' with the movie.",10,0,3,1 March 2019
Thirteen Days," Hard to keep up with
","The movie was interesting, but I had a hard time following the story line. I usually enjoy historical movies and what events they are based off of. I have a harder time watching politician based movies, but that is just my opinion. The movie was going by very fast kind of skimming over what was happening during that time period. The only thing that I understood was who is who and a general idea of the events that described in the movie.",3,1,6,26 February 2019
Back to the Future," Great movie
","I personally grew watching this movie, so I always get a bit nostalgic. One of my favorite scenes is when Marty-main character- plays the guitar. It starts out with the blues but morphs into rock. The main plot of the story is that a kid goes back in time and accidentally messes up a few things. Which he then later has to fix or his life will be all messed up. The movie was set in the 80's then changed to the 50's when Marty goes back in time. What was interesting to me about the history was one, their clothes, and two their day to day life. I have seen a lot of movies set in the 50's and few are my personal favorite. Obviously a lot has changed when it comes to our daily life, but a few things have stayed consistent. Like high school for example had almost stayed the same. The director of the film is Robert Zemeckis, I have not seen any other movies that have been directed by him. I know two actors that are in this film, Christopher Lloyd and Michael J Fox. Christopher Lloyd was Doc Brown and Michael J Fox was Marty, I have seen both of them in other movies. I love both of these actors and I think that they do an amazing job in this movie as well as others. Another favorite scene of mine is the Marty on skateboard vs Bif and truck scene. I think how they shot it as well as editing is hilarious.",10,0,0,30 January 2019
