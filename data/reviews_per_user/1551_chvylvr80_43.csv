Scarface," Great movie but given more credit than it deserves
",Scarface has got to be one of the most overrated movies ever. It's a great movie don't get me wrong and Al Pacino turns in one of his best performances ever. The movie has been elevated to a level that it doesn't deserve however. The rap community in particular have made this movie almost a blueprint of how to make it in this country. That isn't the lesson of the movie but there you go.Al Pacino is really putting on a show here and his performance should have won an Oscar. The rest of the cast also turns in fine performances but Al carries the film. Scarface never seems to lag or threaten to turn boring. Riding with Tony Montana is a thrill ride that doesn't slow down until the film ends. The best part of the movie remains the closing when we get to say 'ello to Al's little friend. The whole film is good though and it's a classic. It isn't the greatest movie in history like some people say but it's pretty good. Bottom Line: Scarface is a kick ass movie but it isn't the Citizen Kane of gangster films like some people say it is. Make your own decision,8,0,1,12 January 2004
Gremlins," A great 80's critter comedy
","Gremlins isn't a incredible movie that you rave about. It's just a funny, charming movie that you can watch over and over. The cast doesn't make a big impression. (Zach Galligan got far didn't he) The direction by Joe Dante is servicable and keeps the film moving. This movie doesn't bother with subplots and just show the quiet town of Kingston Falls being torn apart by the Gremlins. Gremlins started the little monster movie genre, spawning a bunch of inferior imatations. (Ghoulies anyone?)Most people remember Gremlins fondly and I'm one of those. It's a fun flick and perfect for the whole family. Bottom Line: Gremlins is not an award winner, but fun and scary all the same.",8,0,1,15 September 2003
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A disgrace to the original films
","This was the most anticipated film of all time. Imagine the disappointment when it came out. This movie was insultingly bad on so many levels. George Lucas seems to think that CGI would make the Star Wars franchise so much better. Wrong! The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones were mere shadows of the first three movies. Movies he has also seen fit to put his revisionist hand on. Someone needs to stop Lucas before he screws up Indy 4. The film does have good special effects. This is it's only good point however. The cast doesn't have the charisma of the old one and Ewan Mcgregor was a bad choice for Obi-Wan. Jar Jar Binks sums up everything that is wrong with this film. It was made for the kiddies who weren't even alive when Star Wars came out. It completely forgets the Gen X fans that have made Star Wars so big and Lucas so much money. Bottom Line: A betrayal to the fans and to the world. You must see it if you haven't. I know you must. It needs to be seen to put the originals in the proper perspective. You know, classic film vs. hackneyed 'prequel'.",4,1,2,16 September 2003
Training Day," A great cop thriller
","Training Day kicks ass. Denzel Washington turns in one of the greatest performances of his career and this movie never lags for a second. Some cop films make the mistake of getting too deep in the plot and leaving things like acting and action by the wayside. Training Day achieves the perfect balance. Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke play well off each other and you end up liking each character. The supporting cast does well but it's Washington and Hawke that you are watching. Scott Glenn is good as a drug dealer that's a friend of Washington. The film takes place over the course of one day and what a day that is. From shooting it out with gang members to finding out just how dirty a cop Denzel is, Ethan Hawke finds that his first day on Denzel's beat is a very dangerous one.Bottom Line: I highly recommend this movie. If you haven't seen it yet you're missing out. A first class cop drama/thriller.",9,0,11,10 February 2004
Se7en," Probably the greatest murder story ever
","Seven's quality puts it so far beyond most of the 'cops on trail of deranged killer' genre that it comes out as a true jewel of cinema. Everything about seven is perfect. It is art captured on film. This movie is a bright spot for all of the stars who worked on it. Brad Pitt never gets the credit he deserves for his acting because he's a pretty boy and the press is a lot more interested about how he and Jennifer are doing. That's a shame because he is a talented actor that isn't afraid to take chances with both the roles that he picks and the characters that he plays. That is quite rare in the A-list world. Morgan Freeman is a great actor. You can always count on him to do what he does best which is play a wise veteran that has seen it all. Kevin Spacey is another great actor that has great range and really puts life and personality into his characters.
The real talent of this movie, excluding the actors that brought it to life, is the director David Fincher and the writer Andrew Kevin Walker. Fincher's talents for making a visually stunning film are now well known and he often brings a dark patina to his work. Andrew Kevin Walker must have some incredible demons living inside him. Either that or one hell of an imagination for bringing the intricate story of Seven and the plan of John Doe to life. John Doe's plan really is twisted and I won't be spoiling it here. Suffice to say I have never seen so evil and complicated a plan in a movie before or since. The cinematography of the film is dark but beautiful and throughout the film it is either night or raining or both except for two very brief moments. It is such an emotional movie that you can't keep from being caught up in what is happening. Do you understand and sympathize with what John Doe is doing or do you think him a mad killer that must be stopped.Bottom Line: If you haven't had the opportunity to see Seven yet then you must at least rent it. It is so damn good that I know you will like it. The only reason you wouldn't is because you're just too damn fragile to take something this hardcore.",10,482,585,15 October 2003
The Big Lebowski," I didn't know movies could kick this much ass
","The Big Lebowski is one of the Coen brothers' best movies so far. I can't believe that more movies aren't this funny or original. Hollywood needs to take a lesson from the Coens and start making quality films instead of churning out crap like Gigli and Legally Blonde. The Big Lebowski is perfectly cast. Jeff Bridges IS the Dude and I've never seen him more comfortable and at home in a role. John Goodman's Walter is one of the funniest and most conflicted characters he has ever played. Everyone in the movie does well, Philip Seymour Hoffman deserves praise for his proper, endlessly smiling assistant Brant. The soundtrack enhances the feel of the film and fits it perfectly. The humor and innate weirdness of the movie only furthers the genius of the Coen brothers. Bottom Line: So funny, so great, so Coen, if you don't like this movie I'm sorry but you don't know what GOOD is.",10,0,1,26 September 2003
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," The funniest movie in years
","South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut is simply a long episode of South Park with everything that they can't do or say on TV. That said, Matt Stone and Trey Parker went out of their way to make this movie as dirty and offensive as possible, they succeeded and the movie is much better for it. If you're small-minded, uptight, or easily offended this movie isn't for you. I thought it was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Just when you think they won't say that or go there they do and this movie pushes the boundaries of good taste. It's a classic. The musicals grate on your nerves sometimes but some of them are funny. Bottom Line: If you can stomach this movie, you'll love it. If you can't, why are you reading about this movie you prude!",8,0,0,16 September 2003
Blade," One of the best vampire movies
","The Blade series is a shot in the arm to vampires movies, action movies, and sci-fi movies put together. Blade remains one of the best comic book adaptations and the best black superhero. Wesley Snipes is perfect to play Blade since he has the look and physical ability to pull off the roll and since brotha Snipes isn't really given the credit he's due, this is a great vehicle for him.The fights in Blade are the best things about the movie. Plenty of swordplay balances out the gunbattles so there is something for everybody. The soundtrack fits each scene perfectly and like the sequel's, it's a great techno soundtrack. The tone and look of the movie is dark but that enhances the look and the feel of this kick ass movie. There is not much slow time and the slow time that there is is dedicated to explaining some of Blade's story. The supporting cast also does a fabulous job. Kris Kristoffersen, Donal Logue, and Stephen Dorff fill out their characters completely and all are accomplished actors.Bottom Line: Although bested by Blade 2, this is still a great movie and the DVD is filled with great extras. A must have if you like action films.",9,0,1,20 October 2003
X-Men," The best ever comic adaptation
","X-Men succeeds where so many other movies that are based on comic books fail. They don't stay true to the original story or look. Although this is hard to do with a film, Bryan Singer and the cast of X-Men have done it. X-Men may not feature all of the X-men, but those that do make it to the screen do not fail to impress. The best mutant and best acting by far is by Wolverine as played by Hugh Jackman. Jackman makes the character his own and I can't see anyone else playing the role. Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, Ian McKellen, and Patrick Stewart all turn in flawless performances, lending depth to their characters without decending into camp. The special effects are dazzling and the cinematography helps make this film candy for the eyes. With the success and quality of it's sequel and no end in sight, I smell a franchise on the way. Bottom Line: X-Men is a great movie hands down. You need to have this in your collection if you like comic books or action/Sci-Fi movies.",8,0,0,17 September 2003
The Terminator," Arnie would be nothing without this movie
","The Terminator is the beginning of Arnold Schwartzenegger's rule of Hollywood and it turns out all of California. The Terminator is still his best role to date. Arnold does a incredible job of playing the unstoppable Terminator. Linda Hamilton was never what you'd call talented and Michael Biehn never saw the success that he deserves.James Cameron's greatest talent lies in creating great setpieces and backdrops for his stories. He also has an eye for action, and The Terminator has plenty of both. The makeup effects are a bit primitive even for the time but they were cool then and they still work now. The Terminator's vision is always been a cool effect to me but it is used sparingly in this film. The action and gunplay are some of the best ever seen in an Arnold or Cameron film and that's saying something. Bottom Line: The Terminator is a classic that doesn't get old and never gets boring. At least when Arnie is onscreen.",8,0,1,14 October 2003
Taxi Driver," Yet another Scorcese masterpiece
","Martin Scorcese is one of the world's most talented directors. If you're reading this review then you know this already. This is one of his earlier efforts but that doesn't mean that this film lacks power or quality. It's a shame that more movies aren't like this. Robert De Niro plays the Anti-hero Travis Bickle, the typical everyman, with skill and intensity. Jodie Foster shows her early acting chops as a prostitute that Travis fancies. The city of New York in the 70's is practically a character in the movie and is shown in all it's gritty glory. Travis grows tired of watching the human scum polluting the city get away with everything and decides to take matters into his own hands. The result is a view of the transformation of the character that De Niro handles with aplomb. The movie deserves all the kudos that it gets in the media and is well worth viewing. Bottom Line: You can't call yourself a movie fan and not have Taxi Driver on your shelf. Movies this good are rare and worth appreciating.",8,0,1,29 August 2003
Full Metal Jacket," Mind-blowing war drama
","Full Metal Jacket isn't the best overall Vietnam movie but it does the best job of capturing a Marine's journey from Boot camp to the Nam. The first half of the movie, set in the Marine training barracks of Parris Island, are spellbinding in their power and raw brutality. This movie is not for the faint of heart and makes you glad you didn't join the Corps. R. Lee Ermey is perfect as Gunnery Sargent Hartman, a role he used to fill in real life. Although he has proven himself a capable actor in later roles, this is the role that put him on the map and it remains his signature and best character. Matthew Modine plays the protaganist Pvt. Joker with grace, humor and humility. Versatile actor/God Vincent D'Onofrio plays Pvt. Pyle with such skill that his performance is painful to watch at times. The rest of the supporting cast is great as well. Kubrick takes on the war genre with skill and turns out a true masterpiece. He is probably one of the greatest directors ever. Bottom Line: If you like war movies and you haven't seen Full Metal Jacket, I pity you. Go buy it. You won't want to give it back if you rent it.",8,0,0,15 September 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Another insult to humanity
","Attack of the Clones confirms that George Lucas has completely lost his mind. Now there are lots of Star Wars fans that love this film and will gladly eat any Star Wars crumbs that happen to fall from The Great Lucas's beard. They gave the movie 10's and glowing reviews blah blah blah. I'm more subjective and under the impression that anyone, no matter how great or important, can do a horrible job. Lucas has totally screwed the pooch on The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. One can only hope that Episode III is better than these two wastes of film stock. Like the first film, Attack of the Clones's only saving grace is the special effects. The rest of the film is a disgrace to the original trilogy. Bottom Line: This film sucks, I want my money back.",5,1,2,16 September 2003
Fargo," It's as good as everyone says it is
","Fargo is the first Coen brothers movie to really attract some critical and box office success and the first film to start attracting the attention that the Coens' should have been getting all along. Fargo is yet another of their twisted fairy tales that can be watched over and over and you never get tired of it. Coen regulars Frances McDormand, Peter Stormare, and Steve Buscemi all do a fabulous job. William H. Macy does his character so well that this role will follow him the rest of his career. The sets and scenery perfectly portray the bleak midwestern landscape. Like other Coen films, this movie blends seriousness and humor to keep the mood light and keep the film from being a bland downer. There are better Coen films out there but this remains one of their best. Bottom Line: It's a great movie and one well worth buying. If you haven't seen it yet you're missing out.",9,0,0,13 October 2003
Léon: The Professional," A true Professional
","Leon must be the greatest movie about a hitman. Luc Besson perfectly tells the story of Leon, a lonely man that only has his work to keep him busy. This film is a lot more than just a gritty story about killing though.
Jean Reno is an underrated actor and quite charming. He brings Leon to life and adeptly shows his transformation from soulless killer to a man who realizes that life involves living and loving and not killing. Natalie Portman does a fine job of being the object of Leon's affections. Although some people see this movie as having barely veiled pedophile overtones, all of the scenes with Reno and Portman are innocent and nothing is implied I think. Gary Oldman pulls off an incredible performance as the evil, corrupt DEA agent Stansfield. His performance is over the top but it's great fun to watch.The gunfights in this film are some of the best ever captured and make this movie a great action film. Leon truly is a professional. This movie keeps you in your seat waiting to see what will happen next.Bottom Line: This is a great, although sometimes disturbing film. If you want to see how the Europeans pull off good cinema, look no further.",10,0,1,24 October 2003
The Bourne Identity," Just wasn't diggin this one
","This film just reinforced a feeling I had that some directors think that it is entertaining to keep the audience confused and lost throughout the movie. This hard to follow and quite boring waste of film stock employs Matt Damon who I don't really like but whatever, he did a decent job of not getting on my nerves at least. Bottom Line: I could have lived without seeing this. This movie doesn't warrant a further expense of energy from me.",4,1,2,10 March 2003
The Thing," the greatest horror film ever
","The Thing is destined to go down in history as one of history's greatest horror films. John Carpenter shows again that he is a talented and underappricated director. The Thing itself manages to be both scary and wonderfully creative. Kurt Russell shows one of his best performances as the scared yet determined protaganist MacReady. Wilford Brimley, Keith David, and Donald Moffat also display fine acting. John Carpenter's soundtrack is suitably weird for the movie, and Rob Bottin's monster effects stand up great even in this age of CGI. This movie will scare the crap out of you if you aren't already desensitized to this sort of thing and the tense plot leaves you wanting more. Bottom line: This is a incredible film that needs to be in your library. Get it now and remember, Man is the warmest place to hide.",10,0,1,4 March 2002
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Worthy addition to the series
","Terminator 3 continues to offer great sci-fi action in the tradition of it's predecessors. Arnold is starting to look a little old but he still fits in arguably the best role of his career. Nick Stahl as John Connor continues Eddie Furlong's tradition of being an annoying brat that you wish the Terminator would stop protecting. Claire Danes isn't given much to do, and the T-X is both beautiful and deadly. The movie delivers as far as great effects and action sequences are concerned but tends to lag when the story focuses on John. Overall it's something that should be seen in the theaters, all the summer blockbusters should. Bottom Line: It's a good flick and the DVD promises to be filled with extras. Buy it and complete your Terminator collection.",7,0,0,10 July 2003
U-571," Historically inaccurate but good sub movie SPOILER ALERT!
","U-571 isn't Das Boot but it will satisfy war movie lovers for now. The effects and the sets are very well done but the characters are a different story entirely. There is very little in the way of good acting, even considering the caliber of the cast. Character development is almost nonexistant. The only good thing about the character development is they kill Bon Jovi. He should stick to making music that sucks and should stay away from lending his suck talents to movies. The U-571 itself looks very good and realistic and the DVD shows the construction of all the sets and the sub. Matthew McConaughey does an average job and I can say the same for Bill Paxton and Harvey Keitel. I was expecting more action. There is some action but I was expecting more. Bottom Line: It isn't a classic, but it is entertaining.",7,0,2,8 October 2003
The Shining," King + Kubrick = Art
","The Shining has to be Kubrick's best film ever. It's creepy atmosphere is one of the film's greatest strengths. I absolutely love this film, being that it is based on my favorite book. Many people criticize this film for not being a good adaptation of the book and this is true. The film is not a great adaptation of the book because many subplots, plot points, and scenes in the book are left out. However under no circumstances does this diminish the power of the film. The interior sets are very well made and quite spectacular. The Overlook and many of the characters pictured therein are exactly how I pictured them in the book. All the performances in the film are great. Jack Nicholson does classic Jack as Jack Torrance. Shelly Duvall is nothing like her character in the book, but she still manages to make her part work. Danny Lloyd provides a good and not an 'annoying cute child' part as Danny Torrance. The late great Scatman Crothers plays a perfect Jack Halloran. It's a great shame that Mr. Crothers is no longer with us as he was a fine, charming actor. His charisma is such that I consider it my loss that I had never known the man. The Shining is a showpiece of direction and cinematography. A beautiful and eerie soundtrack contributes to the film's unearthly feel. This film certainly earns it's place on the Imdb Top 250. Bottom Line: The Shining is one of my very favorite movies of all time and it is a incredible film by any standard. If you haven't seen it yet see it and if you haven't read the book yet then read it. It really completes the picture of the story. This film is a cinematic masterpiece. A work of art.",10,0,1,24 September 2003
Duck Soup," The Marx Brothers at their best, and that's saying something
","Duck Soup is a comedic masterpiece. In fact, I'm going to come out and say right now that the Marx Brothers are the greatest comedians in cinematic history. You can argue if you want, you're wrong. No one can craft comedy like the Marx Bros. and they unfortunatly are not getting their due with the younger generations. Duck Soup is probably their best film. The jokes come fast and furious and you never stop laughing. All Marx Bros. movies have many trademarks and each brother plays essentially the same character in every film. You may think that would get old but it doesn't. Marx Bros. movies have little in the way of plot but that's ok because it isn't needed. All the Brothers need is a setting and they wreak havoc wherever they are. Margaret Dumont is the romantic foil for Groucho in several of their movies and she does a fine job here. In case you were never blessed with seeing one of their films, Groucho is the master of the put down and his quick wit is unmatched, Harpo is the mute trickster, Chico the scheming Italian, and Zeppo the handsome straight man. All of the Marx Brothers were very musically talented and show off their talents in all of their films. Bottom Line: if you haven't seen any of the Marx Brothers movies, see this one first and then go and see them all. And then buy them all. You won't regret it.",10,0,0,10 July 2003
Apocalypse Now," This movie is art
","Apocalypse Now is one of those movies that you can't take in all at once. It takes repeated viewings to appreciate the full spectrum and breadth of the film. Rarely has a film so spectacular and awe-inspiring been made, especially in regards to a war film. This movie boasts a stellar cast, intricate yet simple plot, emotional soundtrack, beautiful locations and cinematography, and a firm grasp of the horrors, weirdness, and confusion of war. Martin Sheen gives what is perhaps the best performance of his career. Marlon Brando provides a suitably eerie and mysterious air. Robert Duvall deserves special praise for his over the top portrayal of Col. Kilgore. The entire cast is wonderful but these three characters stand out. The journey up the Mekong river by the four man crew of the PBR and Sheen is at times funny, exciting, sad and soul-searching. The end of this film is one of the most atmospheric that I have ever seen, and borders on art. The 45 minutes of footage that has been restored to the film are for the most part,worthwhile additions. The French dinner scene however, slows the pacing of the movie and drags on pointlessly. It is the only complaint I have about this masterpiece. Bottom Line: Apocalypse Now might just be one of the best movies ever. If you haven't seen it yet you owe it to yourself to experience this one of a kind film.",10,1,1,4 September 2003
Aliens," Game over man! Game over!
","I've been putting off reviewing this movie because I didn't think that I could do it justice but I've decided to start reviewing my extensive collection in order and Aliens is one of the first on the shelf. Aliens is THE best blend of action and Sci-Fi that has yet been made. If you like war movies or action movies or Sci-Fi then this is the movie that you've been waiting for. It is easily the best of the Alien films and the best movie that James Cameron has put out. That is saying a lot but Aliens is no ordinary film. I won't go into the plot because if you wanted to know that then you can look elsewhere on the Aliens page but suffice to say the story promises much and delivers in spades. Everyone in the movie makes their character work from all the Colonial Marines to Sigourney Weaver (Ripley) herself. I will always know Paul Reiser as the scumbag Burke and Bill Paxton will always be Hudson no matter what else either of them do. The set design and prop design of this film are a sight to behold and the makers of this film succeeded in making whatever point in the future this movie is set in come to life. (Throughout the Alien series, there is no mention of date, I'm sure there is a tiny reference somewhere but I'm obviously not hardcore enough to sniff it out. If somebody knows let me know.)The design of the Marines armor, weapons, and vehicles delivers special praise because I can really see Marines in the future looking like they do in the film. That they still use projectile weapons is something that I won't even try to get into here. At least they're caseless. The aliens themselves are the greatest contribution to the world that H.R. Giger has ever made, his weird art nonwithstanding. The bio-mechanical look of the aliens is a great design. The whole look of the movie is simply incredible. Bottom Line: This movie rules, buy it and put it on the mantlepiece in a lighted, dust-shielded alcove. Then worship it in a pagan fan-boy ceremony. Or better yet just leave it in the DVD player all the time.",10,0,0,22 August 2003
The Exorcist," One scary masterpiece
","The Exorcist has been called the scariest movie of all time and I'm inclined to agree with that. The Exorcist is the best movie that William Friedkin ever made, and that includes The French Connection. It's hard to describe the atmosphere of the film without seeing for yourself. You get the feeling that something isn't right. Even in the beginning, before you have even seen Linda Blair, you get this feeling of dread. Not many films can do that.
I wonder sometimes why Linda Blair never went on to fame and fortune after The Exorcist. She does a fabulous job as Regan. Her performance is even more amazing considering her age (12) at the time. She had to endure some serious tortures for the role and her acting in the film is shocking. The rest of the cast: Max Von Sydow, Ellen Burstyn, and Jason Miller all turn in credible and emotional performances. Special attention must go to Jason Miller (Father Karras) since this was his first film. The subliminal effects, makeup effects, and sound effects all turn The Exorcist into something otherworldly. When you watch this movie, you get the feeling that Satan might very well exist and he might even have had a hand in making this movie. At the very least he had a hand in destroying Linda Blair's career. Bottom Line: This masterpiece should be on every movie fan's shelf. If you haven't seen it yet then you've really missed out. Oh yeah, in the new version with restored footage, the spider walk scene scared the living @%#$ out of me. And I'd seen the movie countless times.",10,1,2,16 October 2003
American History X," A masterpiece that hits hard
","American History X is Edward Norton's showpiece. It is the film that shows the world that Norton is the De Niro of our time. Transforming himself in the intelligent skinhead Derek Vineyard is a textbook example of great acting. His co-stars, even Eddie Furlong, combine to make this movie a great one. The message of the movie is not subtle but hits you right in the face with reality. People hate, and that hate can be turned around to hurt you in the worst way. This film doesn't lag for a second and every frame is loaded with meaning and emotion. This isn't a movie for the faint hearted and if you don't like what you are watching then it will be even harder for you to digest the fact that there are people out there just like every character in the movie. I think that everyone is racist to some degree and this movie has you both agreeing with what Derek has to say but at the same time thinking that you're not in the same boat as he is. You don't hate like he does. Well you may not but you can't help but be moved by his saga. Bottom Line: This movie deserves the place that it has on the top 250 and if you haven't seen it yet then you owe it to yourself to check it out. If you have seen it then go and see it again.",9,1,2,7 May 2003
Pearl Harbor," Bruckheimer and Bay must pay for their crimes
","This movie takes an incredible premise and stomps the life out of it. This movie should have been called Love on the Beach. The trailer makes it like it's all about the attack. This is wrong. For the first hour and a half you will be treated to Ben Afleck trying very hard to be tough, Kate Beckinsdale trying even harder to be the strong woman, and Josh Hartnett trying to avoid becoming Freddie Prinze Jr. Then finally you are hit with THE GREATEST BATTLE THAT YOU WILL EVER SEE ON FILM. This scene shows that the past 1 1/2 hours that you p***ed away was not in vain. Every angle is explored as the Japanese wreak havoc on the US fleet. The CGI Zeros look incredibly real and you are treated to Cuba Gooding Jr. fighting to find a reason why he signed on to do this film. Getting behind a dual .50cal AA mount would be enough for me but I'm straying here. Anyways, Jon Voight turns in the best acting in the movie as FDR. Unfortunatly the B twins figured we wouldn't be interested in seeing how the Japanese went about planning the attack. Minimal attention is paid to them in the film. A suitably sappy score underlines this sorry excuse for a war film and I felt cheated as I walked out of the theater. Bottom Line: Buy it if you like the Pearl Harbor scene, otherwise just let your girlfriend rent it and tell her to call you in when the bombing starts.",4,0,1,4 March 2002
Alien vs. Predator," AVP haters don't know what they're talking about
","Well after about 13 years of waiting I finally saw AVP on opening night. I was very pleased with the outcome. Leading up to the opening of the film, the net (IMDB included) was full of fanboys talking all kinds of trash. W.S. Anderson sucks, this movie will suck, blah, blah, blah. Well they are wrong! I don't know what the Comic Book Store guys of the world were expecting, but the movie kicks ass and don't let anyone tell you different. AVP haters are the same kind of people that worship the ground George Lucas walks on while at the same time ripping the new movies for 'not being like the originals.' Whatever. I've said my piece now on to the movie. MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD The first 30 minutes or so is a bit slow, as they need to lay down the story and introduce you to the future dead humans. Wisely, the movie doesn't concentrate on the humans too much as Anderson knows who are the real stars of this show. The Predators make their entrance into the movie with a look onboard their ship as it approaches Earth. Their computer displays are all projected in 3-D, probably so they can see them with their infrared vision. The infrared vision by the way is a bit changed from the first two movies. It's more refined and not as blurry as the original movie's vision. More computerized is the best way I can describe it. The Predator's weapons are the same as in the first two films with the exception of this throwing star with retractable blades that is at least as badass as their plasma cannons, which by the way you won't be seeing as much. The Alien/Predator fights are really spectacular although in a few sequences you can barely see what's happening as everything is moving too fast and the camera is really zoomed in. It reminded me of a Godzilla movie at those moments. Still, the power of these two heavyweights is awesome to behold and both the Aliens and the Predators give and take in this battle. There are casualties on both sides, just about all the humans die,(of course) and despite the PG-13 rating, there is plenty of violence and blood. At least of the glowing green and acid kind. The Predators didn't make much use of their cloaking devices in this one. It didn't help them too much anyway. You come to see this movie for the stars, not for the acting,(sucks) or the storyline(minimal). By the way that the votes are going so far I would say that you are either going to love this movie or hate it. Oh, I almost forgot. They set it up for a sequel. I won't tell you how but it looks pretty cool. This is the best movie to come out since Dawn of the Dead. F***** awesome!!!!!!!!",9,0,0,14 August 2004
Saving Private Ryan," The greatest war movie ever
","For better or worse, Saving Private Ryan has got to be the greatest war movie ever filmed. Far from being some artsy fartsy effort. This film is as hardcore as they come. The 20 minute beach landing scene should show you that this film isn't for the faint hearted. Spielberg has really outdone himself with this movie.The battle scenes are unbelievable. For accuracy, blood, violence and length they are unmatched as far as my experience can say. The beach landing, the assault on the radar site, the heart pounding final battle, all of them are superb portraits of both combat itself and the men involved. All very intense and bloody. If you love movie battles then this is the film you've been waiting for. Some might call this film porn for action junkies but it is more than that. Beautifully shot and orchestrated, Saving Private Ryan is ultimately a tale of the men in combat rather than the combat itself. Unlike a lot of war movies, in Saving Private Ryan you actually care about the characters and don't just look at them as bullet catchers. Bottom Line: This film should be in everyone who calls themselves a movie fan's collection. This movie is not to be missed and should be mandatory viewing in schools.",10,1,2,21 October 2003
The Transporter," An action packed thrill ride
","The Transporter renews my faith in action movies. You don't need incredible effects to up the action quotient like The Matrix, you just need to have lots of chase scenes, shooting and fights. That is what The Transporter provides. Jason Statham should become a box office darling based on his square jawed good looks alone but he also can carry a film. The Transporter doesn't have great acting or plot or anything, it's just solid action. The soundtrack is great and provides a great backdrop for the action. The fight scenes alone are works of art. There are a few 'yeah right' moments, but overall it's a very competent action movie. Bottom Line: If you like action, you'll love The Transporter.",8,0,0,5 September 2003
Ghostbusters," They're coming to save the world!
","I've memorized large portions of Ghostbusters dialogue from watching it so much. I love this movie and have pretty much had it on play for the last 15 years. Why do I love it so much? Well, first of all there hasn't been many good pairings like the Ghostbusters. Now Ernie Hudson was never really part of the group in this movie, in the second one he was more integrated into the fold. Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, and Harold Ramis are a brilliant comedic pairing. The chemistry between these 3 characters is warm and funny. The special effects are good for the time and contribute to the film rather than make up the majority of it like so many films today. Bill Murray especially laces his dialogue with wisecracks and this is one of his best roles. This movie is a classic and I think they should be making a third. Bottom Line: Ghostbusters inspires a cult like few movies. This kind of success is deserved only by the best movies with wide ranging appeal. Ghostbusters is one of these films.",9,0,0,16 September 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tarantino has outdone himself SPOILER ALERT!
","Kill Bill Vol. 1, to say nothing of Vol. 2, is the best film that Tarantino has made so far. Since QT is so versed in different film genres, it is fitting that he had to pay homage to martial arts films. This is the best martial arts film I have ever seen although I must admit I have limited experience with the genre. Everything about Kill Bill is unbelievable. The powerful soundtrack by the RZA that completely fits and compliments each scene. It's perfect and I think I'm going to have to get it. The masterful performance by Uma Thurman, I think an Oscar is not out of the question here. Daryl Hannah surprised me with her acting because acting is not a skill that she is known for. Vivica A. Fox on the other hand, was the same person that she has played in every movie and I was glad that she died early. Lucy Liu was also good although I don't think she is a particularly good actress. Sonny Chiba turns in a great guest appearance and Chiaki Kuriyama....wow. I think that this girl should get her own movie. Evil schoolgirls are not something you see every day. It came as no surprise to me that she also starred in Battle Royale. Although I have not seen Battle Royale yet,(can we get a US DVD release please!!!) I know of it's reputation. This film pays the proper respect to the Kung Fu movies of the seventies down to the vintage opening of the film. Vol. 1 is divided into five chapters and chapter three is the only one I had a problem with as it is entirely in anime and I despise anime. It was well done, I just don't like anime. Michael Madsen's character Budd is not really in Vol. 1 at all and the same with Daryl Hannah's character. We'll have to wait to see them in Vol. 2. The violence that everybody is going on and on about is not as bad as I thought. I thought that some of the blood gushing was actually a little cartoonish but this is how films were done in Hong Kong and so Tarantino is remaining faithful to that. The showdown with O-Ren Ishi's henchmen was shot in black and white I think because if it were in glorious blood soaked color it might have A. turned fragile American audiences off and/or B. gotten Kill Bill stamped with an NC-17 rating. Bottom Line: This movie kicks so much ass and I think it beats the Matrix at it's own game. Go see the best movie of 2003. You won't be able to wait for Vol. 2. I sure as hell can't!",10,0,1,12 October 2003
Black Hawk Down," The greatest battle scenes ever
","This is not the greatest war movie. A great war movie has more than action. A great war movie has reflections about what it all means and war is hell blah blah blah. Now skip all that and let's get down to the most straight to the point war movie ever made. Black Hawk Down takes about 30 minutes to set the story and then it's just about solid action from that point on. Gun battle after gun battle, it's Rangers vs. Somalians in the best war action ever caught on tape. There isn't much in the way of character development or soundtrack or acting or anything, but we don't really want to know a whole lot about these bullet catchers. Just watching them fight for their lives is enough. Ridley Scott is one talented director. He hasn't done this good since Blade Runner. Bottom Line: If you like war movies, guns, action, the military, or American history, this deserves a place on your shelf.",8,0,0,25 August 2003
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino's best so far
",Reservoir Dogs is that rare movie that can be watched over and over and over again and you never grow tired of it. Tarantino's gift for writing great dialogue is never more evident than it is in this film. The dialogue is what makes his movies so great. The characters talk like real people instead of sounding like they're reading from a book. Reservoir Dogs doesn't show you most of the action but prefers to involve you in the panicked recollections of the thieves as they try to suss out the rat amongst them. Great performances by all involved and a K-tel ready soundtrack help make Dogs a great movie to watch. This film is arguably the movie in Tarantino's bag that has the smallest scope. It doesn't take place in a lot of places like Jackie Brown and has a smaller cast of characters than either Brown or Pulp Fiction. We have to wait until the release of Kill Bill Vol.1 and 2 to see if he can top his first effort. Bottom Line: Brilliant moviemaking from the modern crime master. If you haven't seen this then you really need to step away from the computer and go get it. If you have seen it and you don't have the DVD special edition then you may be forgiven for your sloth at not picking it up yet. Go get it. Mr. Blonde version if you please.,9,1,3,26 September 2003
Enemy at the Gates," interesting yet tedious
","This is a good movie but one that is a bit long. The love story between Jude Law and Rachel Weisz distracts from telling the mostly true story of Vassili Zaitsev, Russia's greatest sniper during WWII. The duel between Law and german Major Konig, played by Ed Harris, is long but still manages to be tense. Harris and Law's scenes are the best parts of the movie, everything else is just filler. Bob Hoskins turns in a good performance as the future premier of the USSR, Mikhail Krushchev. I wasn't as impressed by this movie as I thought I would be. While the scope of this movie and the battle scenes are quite impressive, this film ends up being somewhat bogged down by the ponderous love story that was made up by the producers to attract a larger female demographic. Bottom Line: Check this movie out, but rent before you buy.",5,0,1,10 March 2002
Die Hard," An action packed experience
","Die Hard shows us what kind of movies Bruce Willis used to make. Fun, exciting, funny movies. Now he makes crap, but Die Hard was back when he was in his prime. Die Hard has some of the best action scenes ever and has you pulling for John McClane all the way. Alan Rickman is great as the horrible uber-villian Hans Gruber. The setting of this movie in a skyscraper really lays out some good settings for action and this movie delivers. Bottom Line: A great action film and one of Willis's best.",8,1,3,11 September 2003
Bram Stoker's Dracula," the most faithful adaptation of the novel
","Bram Stoker's Dracula is most faithful to the original story and the only Dracula movie I'm aware of that takes notice of both the sexual tension of the Victorian era and the love story that Dracula presents. Dracula is a fine film that shows off the talents of all it's actors save one and the talent of Francis Ford Coppola.The one actor to screw up his character is Keanu Reeves. They made him look like he was from 1898 all right but he has trouble bringing his character to life. That comes as no surprise to me because I've always known that he is a marginal talent that has his looks to thank for his fame. He is really Ted in every movie. In The Matrix he was Hacker Ted, in Speed he was Cop Ted, in Point Break he was FBI Ted, and in Dracula he is Victorian Ted. The fact that Keanu sucks shouldn't distract you from the great performances of his fellow actors though. Gary Oldman is probably the most underrated actor ever. He is a master at accents and is a completely different character in every movie he's in. Oldman plays Dracula without a hint of camp and with all the emotion that the character demands. Anthony Hopkins is another talent that fills the screen with his good but a little over the top portrayal of Dr. Van Helsing. Winona Ryder, Sadie Frost, Richard E. Grant, Bruce Campbell, Cary Elwes, and even Tom Waits all turn in masterful acting jobs.The visual aspect of Dracula is it's greatest strength in my opinion. The spectacular sets really bring you into the story. The elaborate and beautiful costumes by Oscar winner Eiko Ishioka are incredible. The original score is quite moving and fits the scenes that it is in perfectly.Basically what I am trying to say here is that Dracula is the most well made vampire movie and the best told Dracula story ever. It is told lovingly by a director who is a master of his craft and a cast that relishes their roles. Except for Ted, er Keanu Reeves.Bottom Line: It really sucks that this film has not received the Special Edition DVD treatment yet, as the current DVD has no extras at all and not even a trailer. If you haven't seen it then rent it, see it, fall in love with it, and then wait for the Special Edition to come out. It will eventually. Look how long we had to wait for Indiana Jones.",10,2,3,15 October 2003
The Cannonball Run," a fun filled race across the US
","The Cannonball Run has been vilified by many critics over the years but I love this movie and have been watching it ever since I was little. This movie is what happens when a bunch of movie stars who just happen to be close friends in real life decide to make a movie just for fun. The plot is simple enough, race from one end of the country to the other for a million dollars and avoid the law on the way. The cast is jammed with big names and just about everyone in the movie that has a speaking part is a star of some stature. This movie is simply great fun and has a lot in common with the rest of director Hal Needham's films,i.e. Smokey and the Bandit. I can't really say that this film is full of great acting because the entire cast horses around through the whole movie. Jackie Chan makes his first appearance in a American movie with this film and both Hal Needham and writer Brock Yates have cameos. Don't expect a lot in the way of plot or acting or effects or anything like that and just enjoy the ride. The outtakes at the end of this and Cannonball Run II are hilarious and it makes it more fun for me anyway to know that this movie was just like a big meeting of old friends. Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. are great as Blake and Fenderbaum respectively. Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise anchor this film (they're the main characters)and the give and take between these two make them one of the best comedy teams I have ever seen. Bottom Line: Buy this flick, drag it out every once in a while, and have fun watching it with family or friends. A truly fun movie to watch.",9,38,48,8 March 2002
The Emperor's New Groove," The funniest Disney film ever
","The Emperor's New Groove has two qualities that separate it from the rest of the Disney animated pack: humor that can actually be enjoyed by someone over the age of five and only one musical number and it's at the beginning. That's the appeal of this film. Most animated Disney films both in the past and now have just too much singing in them. Not everyone loves singing animals so Emperor's is a good movie for those of you who didn't like the squealing songs of Aladdin of The Lion King.The cast is what really makes this movie funny. Great writing coupled with the talents of David Spade, Eartha Kitt, John Goodman, and Patrick Warburton make this movie a laugh riot. Some of the jokes are geared towards adults so mom and dad won't be bored while watching this flick. Bottom Line: This is a good movie and one of the funniest ever made by Disney. It's good for all ages.",7,2,4,16 October 2003
Blade Runner," The best Sci-Fi movie ever made
","I'm always nervous when writing a review of a well known and respected movie that is dear to my heart. I'm afraid that I won't do the film justice. Ok, here I go. Blade Runner is the greatest work of both Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford. Harrison plays beautifully the part of Deckard. Deckard is not an invincible hero but a regular man who can sometimes screw up or be a bit of a coward. He's a normal guy, and Harrison shows us his sadness and regret. Rutger Hauer is perfect as the poetic Roy Batty, desperate to experience life a little longer. I could go on with the rest of the cast but every person in this film does Oscar caliber work. The vision of Los Angeles in 2017 is both beautiful and depressing. Spectacular sets and matte painting abound. The mournful score enhances the mood of the film, and the story is simple yet brilliant. Ridley Scott proves to be a great director and really shows us what a work of art this film is. It is a pity that the movie did badly on it's debut but no one accused the American public of having taste. Bottom Line: This movie is sheer art and to miss seeing this film is missing one of the great films of not only Sci-Fi but history. A classic and a masterpiece.",10,1,4,11 September 2003
X2: X-Men United," Blows the first one away
",X2 has everything that X Men lacked. Most notably this is more screen time and fight scenes for Wolverine. Hugh Jackman makes a great Wolverine and I can't see anyone else in the role. Nightcrawler is the coolest mutant (except for Wolverine) introduced so far and his teleportation ability is visually dazzling and helps him do things no other mutant can. Colossus's cameo is cool but he should have been given more scenes. Hopefully in X3 he will be given more. My only complaint is that the film runs a bit long and drags in some spots. A few cuts would have kept this movie tighter and more concise. The effects in this movie are spectacular and are one of the movie's greatest strengths. I hope that the X Men films just keep getting better. Bottom Line: This is a must see in the theater. You have to see it on the big screen and then do your duty as an American and buy it on DVD.,8,0,0,5 May 2003
The Thin Red Line," A beautifully shot but boring film
","The Thin Red Line aims to be the most beautiful war epic ever shot, and considering that this film was once originally 6 hours in length, I can certainly believe it. What this film has in spades is reflections of how horrible war is and many frames of the beauty of nature, trampled by man's horrid conflict. What this movie lacks is the money shots. What I mean by money shots is the combat sequences are for the most part short and sterile. If you're looking for violent and thrilling combat scenes look elsewhere.The first battle scene when the troops try a frontal assault up the hill is the best scene in terms of combat. An arguement between Elias Koteas and Nick Nolte is a well acted and dynamic scene. It just doesn't get your blood rushing though. The battle sequence is so long that it loses some of it's momentum and energy. The cast of this movie is one of the biggest and most accomplished ever assembled. The fact that some of the biggest names are onscreen for only a few minutes is pretty misleading to the viewer. George Clooney and John Travolta's scenes might have been bigger but what we see is what you could loosely refer to as a cameo. Plenty of great actors fill the ranks. You just don't see most of them for very long. The way this movie is filmed is very scenic and beautiful. You get the feeling that shots of grass blowing in the wind and flowers floating in gentle streams and the waves of the ocean at dusk shouldn't really be in a war movie. You would be right and wrong. On one hand, these shots show how important and wonderful life and nature is and how ironic it is that there is such slaughter and suffering in so beautiful a place. The other hand though, is that when audiences go to a war movie, they want to see combat. The Thin Red Line is sorely lacking that critical component.Bottom Line: A well done, finely crafted film. Failing to deliver on the action and it's sometimes brain numbing 3 hour length are things you might want to consider before viewing. We can only pray for a Special Edition DVD to show us all those cut scenes.",7,1,2,21 October 2003
Goodfellas," THE best mob film ever
","Goodfellas blows The Godfather away. You read that right. The Godfather is a bloated, wheezing blob compared to this tight masterpiece. The real jewel of this film is the incredible cast, everyone turning in Oscar caliber performances. Goodfellas is one of those movies that you can watch hundreds of times and never get sick of it. Ray Liotta's narration gives you the lay of the land on the story and never grates on your nerves. Martin Scorcese's direction is a thing of beauty and Joe Pesci's performance is the best of his career, even considering he played basically the same character in Casino. A great soundtrack and dazzling cinematography make this film a national treasure. Bottom Line: The power of this film cannot be underestimated and I wouldn't be out of line by saying this is Scorcese's best film. Truly a masterpiece.",10,0,0,16 September 2003
Beetlejuice," This movie rules
","Beetlejuice has got to be one of the most unique and entertaining characters ever put out in the movies. Michael Keaton does a great job as Beetlejuice although it is said that he hated the character and regretted doing the movie. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis do a decent job but Keaton is the one to watch. Winona Ryder, Jeffery Jones, and Catherine O'Hara do an equally decent job but as I said before, Beetlejuice is the one to keep your eye on. With a great soundtrack by Danny Elfman and Tim Burton's bizarre talents at the helm, Beetlejuice is a classic that you can watch over and over. It is a shame that a sequel has not been made. Bottom line: A great comedy and one of Michael Keaton's best performances. Buy it now, thank me later.",8,1,2,4 March 2002
