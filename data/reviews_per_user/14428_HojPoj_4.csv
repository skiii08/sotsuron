The Blair Witch Project," Definitely worth seeing...one time is enough..It stays w/you
","I saw this movie the week before the nation wide release.  With the SciFi Channel and the www.blairwitch.com giving the background to the Blair Witch, it is easy to mistake this move as non-fiction.  Even after I knew it was fictional, I was still enthralled with the movie.  I left it forgetting that it was fake.The shaking of the camera is not that bad, kind of like hearing traffic outside the door...you tend to phase it out.  There are times, however, that I got a smirk at something that was supposed to be scary....AND there are times that something trivial scares the heebie jeebies out of me.I definitely recommend viewing the www.blairwitch.com or the SciFi special before watching the movie.  You will enjoy it more.Overall I give this movie a lot of credit for its originality.",7,1,1,31 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," C'mon....It's Star Wars! What more do you need
","I went in with the highest expectations.  I was a bit disappointed at the lack of character development.  But this isn't Citizen Kane.  The movie accomplished its goal: A fairy tale for all ages.  True Jar Jar Binks annoyed the older crowd, but the little kids (target group) liked him.  The older crowd liked Maul, while the younger kids did not.I recommend reading the Terry Brooks novel after watching the movie (or before) it will fill in some gaps.",8,0,0,31 July 1999
The Mummy," A Great Adventure
","A pleasant combination of Drama, Horror, and Comedy.  The Special effects are eye catching.  I recommend this movie, and would own it when it comes out on DVD.",9,0,0,12 May 1999
The Matrix," An exciting film
","The Matrix is an exciting movie with great special effects.  The premise is a good one, and for the most part was  achieved.  This movie could be viewed on a couple levels:  The action thrill ride, or on a more social commentary of society.  Either way you view this movie, the experience of watching it is profound.",9,0,0,12 April 1999
