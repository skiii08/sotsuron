Blade Runner 2049," They done good by my view!
","When I heard they were going to do a sequel to 'Blade Runner', I cringed. I love that movie, all variations, even own the soundtrack. When I heard 'Ryan Gosling' was gonna be the lead, I cringed harder. Nah a fan.... That sumbitch redeemed himself. If I were going to write a sequel to 'Blade Runner'? THAT movie, would have been it. With Messianic overtones, visuals so stunning, and volume so LOUD I had to put plugs in my ears, because it shook. THAT movie...was the closing chapter on it. AND!!! AND!!! The fact they had a minor visual reference to the movie 'Soldier', and referenced plots from that movie? Beautifully done. And Robin Wright? I know she can act, but dang 'Jeenee', you rocked as 'K's' boss. If you liked 'Blade Runner'? You MUST see this movie. Must. Especially if you remember details from the first, because it enhances this sequel to the point you could watch them back to back. Ridley Scott, and his team deserve some Oscars on this one. Not giving a plot point, or a spoiler... Tears in rain. Beautiful plot twist.",9,1,4,3 December 2017
