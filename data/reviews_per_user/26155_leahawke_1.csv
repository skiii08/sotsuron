The Avengers," Quite possibly the best comic adaptation I have ever seen.
","I am a HUGE Marvel fan. While I haven't read most of the comics in years I still enjoy the characters. Stan lee is a genius and it is wonderful to see his creations coming to the big screen and NOT be a poor, bad acted, cheesy, knock off. This movie, says it all. It shows everyone exactly why they love these comics. And that is simply that we can all be more than the sum of what we are, or perceive ourselves to be. The prior movies are also very close to my heart. Iron man sold me on Robert Downing Jr. again as an actor and someone who can rise above. RDJ personifies Iron Man perfectly, there is no other actor that could ever come close. The turmoil he has in this movie, the battle between his ego and doing what is right despite personal loss is, well, it's a work of pure art. Chris Hemsworth once again shows the world that a man can play a god. He does it with grace and strength, and with my humble opinion; a human element, knowing that while he is stronger than all of his counterparts physically (except Hulk) he is also weak. He gives a character that could have easily have been a 'I am better than you because I am a god' a sense of humanity and humility. Thor is a protector of earth, and he protects her with a fierce resolve. Mark Ruffalo, while I was a bit disappointed that Ed Norton would not be playing Hulk, I was happy and thrilled with the choice. Mr. Ruffalo shows all aspects of the Hulk with smooth, fluid motion. The anger he has to contain, the control he has, he should teach a class on anger management. He shows what I believe to be a true Hulk. The human that fights the beast within. Who among us can say we don't have a little of that in us? Chris Evans, he was the Torch, a cocky, show off that loved the lime light. I was worried about him being a soldier, THE soldier. When I saw Captain America I was blown away by his scope. Something he continues to bring to this movie. He portrays The Captain as a soldier, a soldier out of time. And yet he is quick to adapt, and lead a group of people that you wouldn't imagine could be a team. He honors Captain America with his portrayal of him. Jeremy Renner, I haven't seen many of his movies, but the ones I have I have enjoyed immensely. He took a character that could have easily been just a side note and made him shine. Showing the elements you would expect to see in an assassin. I truly hope that we get to see a solo act for him, I think it would be worth it. Scarlett Johansson continues to portray The Black Widow with skill and grace. She is beautiful and deadly, the perfect Black Widow. Maybe a movie with her and Jeremy Renner? Something to think about. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury was inspired. And in this film you actually get to see more than just Nick Fury popping in for some advice giving and then popping back out. He shows that Nick Fury is a bad ass to be reckoned with. Even standing up to those in charge when he knows their decision is wrong. Clark Gregg, aka Agent Coulson, I will tell you the truth here, I thought he was nothing more than a filler, but he nearly stole the show for me. He did an incredible job, and has in all of these films. He shows an agent that is direct and very much a 'man in black', but then you find that he, well, he has the biggest heart. And he delivers it with a fantastic dry wit. The entire movie was bound together effortlessly with poise, and that sense that we as lowly humans will not back down in the face of impending death, but will fight it until there is no more of us.The last person I want to mention is Joss Whedon. I LOVE this genius, this man who can seamlessly put danger, action, and humor together. He did it with Buffy, Angel, and Firefly. I admire his work to the point that I will watch anything, and everything of his. He was the perfect choice for this, and I can' wait to see what he comes up with next.The overview of this movie is simply, words can no do it justice. It was not just a movie, it was truly an experience. You are sucked into the story, shown by so many different aspects. I have been disappointed with some of the comic movies, X-men:Final Stand, comes to mind (someone please tell me, WHERE in the X-men comics did Charles die? Last I checked he didn't). And with those disappointments comes that lingering feeling of doubt that the movie will not live up to it's hype. I was thrilled that not only did The Avengers, live up to its hype. It surpassed it. I have only one humble request, that the next one have Spider-man, and Wolverine. I recommend this movie to everyone, as it is the personification of why we go to movies, and why this business is a multi-billion dollar one. That we all need to escape our tired lives for a little while and be swept away to a world where, just for two hours, everything makes sense. The bad guys always lose, and the good guys win, with style. :)",10,9,18,27 April 2012
