Come and See," Awesome, haunting, horrifying
","I habitually use the IMDb to find treasures I might not have seen in my day-to-day movie watching, but am rarely as pleased as I was when I found this film.Come and See is the story of a young man who joins the Byelorussian partisans in their resistance to the invading fascist hordes during World War II. The title comes from the Book of Revelations, according to the director in an introductory interviewed contained in the two-disc DVD I saw.The film is based on a group of incidents observed by A. Adamovich during his youth. Director Klimov also grew up during the Patriotic War, but in the Stalingrad area.Filmed exclusively in Byelorussia, the movie has a wonderful feeling of versimilitude, due to the real locations, the naturalistic acting, the wonderful costumes (many of which are authentic WWII issue uniforms, apparently), and the overall somber tone. Special effects are minimal, most are 'in camera.' Most effective of all may be the scene in which the boy hero and his mentor steal a cow and are then shot at by the Germans -- who are never seen until the final forty minutes or so of the film.Highly recommended, especially if your notion of the War on the Eastern Front is derived from 'Hogan's Heroes' reruns -- with the comedic threats of getting Sergeant Schultz sent to the Eastern Front as punishment. Even _Stalingrad_ was not as gritty and real as this film.",10,5,8,17 May 2006
The Birth of a Nation," Great film -- bad history
","Like JFK, this is a GREAT film, but TERRIBLE history.  Griffith's overt racism -- not unusual in its day -- overwhelms the technological masterpiece it must be recognized as, but like Reni Reifenstahl's Triumph des Willens (1934), it *must* be seen to complete any student's education in film.",8,3,7,10 December 2002
Insomnia," It's no Memento
","Good, run-of-the-mill thriller by a director we expect more from, after the memorable Memento.  Nice to see Robin Williams playing the anti-Patch Adams, though -- almost as big a switch as Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast, or Henry Fonda in Once Upon a Time in the West.Pacino is, as always, excellent, and WITHOUT a single scene of overacting! Remarkable, that. Overall, I give it a 6.  Above average, but no award-winner.",6,0,0,19 October 2002
A Bridge Too Far," Better in 1977
","When I first saw this, in the summer of 1977, it was the Greatest War Picture of All Time -- except for Patton, of course, which isn't even in the same class.  It is grotesquely dated now, although I think it's all the fault of the music.Ironically, I own the soundtrack on LP and was a big fan of it at the time -- perhaps that's why I'm so sensitive to it now.  But today it strikes me as bombastic, and a throwback to the kind of music you'd find in a 40's WW2 extravaganza.Disregarding the music, it's a good film.  The explosions, as was the style until Saving Private Ryan, are way too flashy -- bright orange blossoms of pyrotechnic orgasm punctuate every battle scene.  Aside from those and the music, a fine fine film.It's a faithful version of Cornelius Ryan's epic account of Operation Market-Garden and the Battle of Arnhem, directed with gusto and honesty by Richard Attenborough, whom I believe is a veteran of the battle.  The casting is brilliant, except maybe for Ryan O'Neal, who plays the boyish Jim Gavin, well, *too* boyishly.  (O'Neal was 37 during filming, and Gavin was the same age during the battle, but Gavin had two years of battle-hardening under his belt -- his boyishness was relative to older soldiers, not to Hollywood stars!)And aside from the clunky repro German tanks, and the over-obvious use of roll bars on the Kubelwagens, the machinery assembled has rarely been exceeded.  Look at all those Shermans!  See the beautiful C-47s! (Even though it's fairly obvious not that many of them were airworthy, after repeated viewings.)  Watch the Dutch Air Force parachute into their own country, standing in for the British 1st Airborne Division, its Polish contingent, and the American 101st and 82nd Airbornes!  Technically, everything looks great.But the jarring music takes away the versimilitude on a regular basis. Turn it down!Maybe a Special Edition DVD could be produced, separating the music and offering a version sans music, in addition to the 5.1 vs. 2.0 soundtracks... or maybe just a version with the damn music a little quieter.
Lots of maybes.  With those improvements, this would be an eight, but as is, I rate it a 6 on the 10-scale.",8,0,1,21 November 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Best since Empire Strikes Back? Yes!
","If only Hayden Christensen was a better actor, this could have rated a nine-point-nine! He wasn't bad, but like Sofia Coppola in Godfather III, he just wasn't intense/tragic enough for the role. He did get the man/boy-on-the-verge-of-a-breakdown-because-he's-in-love down very well, but his episodes of rage seemed more like Psycho-boy than a young man slipping under the influence of the Dark Side. Mark Hamill, not exactly Olivier himself, did far better in Empire and Return, with the same kind of moral faltering.The effects, of course, were excellent. It's easy to see *why* Lucas apparently wants to remake the first three before releasing them on DVD -- they pale in comparison, even if the battle scenes themselves rival many of those in Clones. Natalie Portman's Padme Amidala was beautiful, intelligent, and well-played.Christopher Lee was excellent as the evil Lord Dooku (I don't think I have that right) -- and he gets to reprise and improve upon his magical fighting skills first displayed as Saruman in Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring.Frank Oz and the geniuses at ILM gave Yoda a reality not understandable without seeing the film. His climactic fight with Dooku was exciting and 'believable,' if that term even has a place in Star Warsiana. Within the Star Wars galaxy, here's my ranking: 1. Empire Strikes Back 2. A New Hope 3. Attack of the Clones 4. Return of the Jedi 5. The Phantom MenaceWithin all moviedom, an eight.",3,0,1,20 November 2002
Pearl Harbor," 'I don't see why people hate this movie...'
","So many 'reviews' of movies *everybody* hates, like this one, begin with that expression.  Obviously, these people don't read the reviews they disagree with!  If they did, they might get a clue as to why so many people feel so strongly in a negative way about the film in question.  If not, they can read this summary:Bad script.Bad acting.Bad history.Bad dialogue.Bad pacing (or was there any?)Bad direction.Bad music.One the other hand ... ... good CGI. ... good sound effects. ... good sound recording. ... good editing.Now I promise: No more comments from me on this most dreadful travesty, from the most talentless director since Edward D. Wood.  At least Ed Wood had a passion for his 'art' -- Bey only seems to have a passion for his paycheck.",1,27,53,29 June 2004
Pearl Harbor," The Good, the Bad, the Pus-filled
","Yuck!  Okay, in more detail:  The acting is atrocious.  The story is cliched.  The dialogue is unlikely in extremis.  Only the special effects are worthwhile.  They're nearly perfect -- although I don't think Michael Bay's preference for green Zeroes (for artistic purposes) justifies their overabundance (the Kate torpedo- and high-level-bombers were in an olive green mottle; the Val dive bombers and Zero fighters were almost exclusively in the Imperial Japanese Navy's blue-grey [almost a dove grey]).  Can fighter jocks be retrained to fly twin engine medium bombers, on the whim of the CO?  Would they want to be?  I doubt the Army Air Force could have spared experienced fighter pilots in the spring of 1942, and besides, all 16 pilots and 16 co-pilots on the Doolittle raid are accounted for: none of them was a recently re-trained fighter pilot, and none of them had been at Pearl Harbor.  And none of them were Welch or Taylor, the two American pilots who made it into the air on 7/12/41.  The modern warships masquerading as pre-WWII warships look as out of place as an M-16 in the Civil War.  Their bows are way too sharp, the biggest giveaway.With all that money to burn, this movie does a disservice to history, to war movies -- even to Romance.Avoid at all costs!",1,0,1,6 January 2003
JFK," Great movie but bad history -- RE-REVIEWED
","'I don't want to quibble over details. Read Gerald Posner's _Case Closed_ for the (probable) truth of the matter, but as a film, you may never see anything more dynamic and manipulative.'Like 'Birth of a Nation' (1915), this is history 'written with lightning,' and as Wilson intended, that can be taken as either a positive comment or a negative one. Like Griffith's racist tirade, 'JFK' is full of misconstructed and ill-conceived ideas, and tells its warped story in a way many another filmmaker would envy. Stone is controversial -- as Griffith was -- and for good cause. But he's a dynamic, original talent. All his films -- 'The Hand' excluded -- bear witness to this. 'JFK' may be his piece de resistance.' -- 2002In the six years since I wrote the above comments, I have done more reading on the assassination of John Kennedy. Of course, in assessing a film it must be remembered that even the most documentary-like of documentaries is a fictional construction. In other words, the truth of what the film is depicting should not be brought in to the discussion. For example, you can't fault 'Pearl Harbor' (or 'Tora Tora Tora,' for that matter) for getting the history wrong, because it is only an entertainment, and cannot ever hope to emulate the reality of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Writers and directors make choices about what they present us, even if it's only one take rather than another. Furthermore, feature films are, on some level, an art form, even the really bad ones like 'Pearl Harbor.' That being said, the truth of what happened in Dallas just after noon on November 22, 1963 should not, by rights, be allowed to influence one's perception of a feature film. But because 'JFK' was and remains so popular, the reality of the case should be mentioned in any responsible discussion of the film. From the beginning, there have been people who believe there was some sort of conspiracy involved in the murder of JFK. The simple fact is, there was not. Read Gerald Posner's 1993 _Case Closed_ for a relatively easy restatement of that, with convincing details... or if you're ambitious, and can stand his sarcasm and condescension, read Vincent Bugliosi's recent _Reclaiming History_. Bugliosi has a substantial chapter about this film that refutes the crap Stone presents as fact. Everyone one who believes in this movie's conclusions should read this chapter, if not the entire 1,600 page book. Frighteningly, 'JFK' had a 'study guide' prepared for its use in classrooms. The fact that Stone is glorifying a DA who not only abused his power in an effort to get and remain in the public eye, but was also possibly insane, should preclude this film being used in anything other than a film theory class. It is NOT history (although it's probably a good version of how Jim Garrison himself might have remembered his 'crusade' against Clay Shaw), it is a tour de force of the filmmaker's art. Even the acting is good... one just wishes an 'A-list' director would film the JFK assassination without the conspiracy crap to both muddy the waters and confound the viewer.Conspiracies are fun to believe in, but they're not a part of what really happened that day. I have downgraded my rating of 'JFK'. Despite its technical mastery, the way this film has warped the public's perception of JFK, Jim Garrison, Lee Harvey Oswald and Clay Shaw, I cannot honor this film with a high rating, any more than I can honor Leni Riefenstahl's Nazi propaganda piece 'Triumph of the Will'. The shear evil of the latter film knocks at least three points off it. 'JFK' loses two points and now gets a '4'. 2 February 2008",4,6,21,27 August 2002
Patton," Still the finest biopic of all time!
","Buck Turgidson.  Ebeneezer Scrooge.  Bert Gordon.  Georgie Patton.  What do these characters have in common?  You know.  George C. Scott's Oscar winning (albeit refused) role as General George S. Patton was the performance he will be remembered by, despite a career full of wonderful characterizations.  He captured Patton's sensitivity, anger and rage, emotionality and wilyness like no other actor has ever captured any other's character.No less an authority than Omar Bradley, played by Karl Malden and acting as Technical Advisor, said Scott got Patton spot-on, except that his gruff baritone was several octaves lower than Patton's tenor. 
Franklin Schaffner never topped his direction of this film -- although he came close in The Day of the Jackal.  MacArthur?  Fuggidaboudit. 
The battle scenes are good -- great, even, given the style of the times. (Not realistic, of course, next to Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers, but still exciting, loud and flashy.  And what more do you really want from a battle scene?)  The history is quite accurate -- the soldier slapping scene, condensed from two incidents, was almost word-for-word how it happened, according to several secondary sources.  The subplot involving German lieutenant Steiner is gratuitous, but gives the viewer some details on Patton's character and biography that might have made the movie appreciably longer if shown.  And it was a clever device to show the progress of Third Army, when casualties and numbers of towns taken are toted up.  This film is based almost entirely on Francis Coppola's screenplay, and an excellent one it is.  Coppola got The Godfather based, I think, more on this screenplay than his direction of Finian's Rainbow.  I believe Scott's performance will be long remembered as one of the all-time great film performances.",10,1,5,20 November 2002
Mulholland Drive," Good Lynch, but no Eraserhead
","This one may be the closest to Eraserhead of all Lynch's work.  It's strange, wonderful, weird, wild, sexy, funny, violent, and non-linear. 
And no, I don't mean to imply there was anything sexy in Eraserhead, but there is a sexual undertone to all Lynch films, including The Elephant Man (though I don't recall such an undertone in Dune or The Straight Story ...). In this one, Twin Peaks and of course Blue Velvet it is front and center, an indelible part of the 'story,' such as it is, as a whole.For those seeking a truly Lynchian experience, this one's hard to beat -- but I'd generally recommend it to his fans only.",6,0,0,7 July 2003
Titanic," Neither as good nor as bad as you've been told
","If only James Cameron could write dialogue!  This is a well-produced fictionalization of the Titanic and her maiden voyage, with all the historical details just right (well, except for some really minor stuff ...).  The romantic story overlaying it all lends poignancy and drew in the crowds, in record numbers.  The performances are, by and large, good-to-excellent, except for Leonardo DiCaprio, who did much better in his earlier movies (up to and including The Quick and the Dead), and Billy Zane, who's never been able to do more than look like a movie star.Cameron is a great director of action, and a good visual story teller.  Too bad he's such a control freak, he ought to allow someone to re-write all his dialogue so that it sounds like humans talking, not T-1000's. 
I give this a 'five' only because the 'seven' it's currently averaged at is too high.",6,2,3,21 October 2002
Die Hard," My favorite Christmas movie
","Within the action/adventure genre, this is tops, a ten.  John McTiernan proves himself the best director in the field, cemented his reputation in Hunt for Red October, and maintained a different kind of momentum with Medicine Man.Bruce Willis did a great job in his first Movie Star role. 
The best urban Euro-terrorist blow-em-up ever!  Ten for the genre, eight overall.",8,1,2,19 November 2002
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Very funny -- but very stupid
","If you're in the mood for just plain stupid humor, this is the movie for you! Will Farrell brings his brand of earnest smarminess, along with the cheesiest mustache since Jim Carrey's in _Me, Myself, and Irene_, to his role as the eponymous Ron Burgundy.The 70's is brought to hilarious life -- everyone smokes, the San Diego sky is clotted with smog, there is no such thing as 'sexual harassment' as an issue - it's just a way of life. It's like the goofier side of _Boogie Nights_.Recommended if you're tired of seriously good movies!",7,3,4,19 July 2005
Platoon," Still excellent
","This is still the best, most realistic film about the horrors of the Vietnam war.  It captures the madness like Apocalpyse Now, the brutality like Full Metal Jacket and the loss-of-innocence angle like no other. 
It could do without the melodramatic 'good sgt. vs. bad sgt.' subplot, but then again, the casting-against-type of both Berenger (known for his good guys up 'til then) and Dafoe (known for his bad guys)was inspired. 
One thing I can't *stand* about this film is that goofy (and fake-looking) shot of Berenger rearing up like King Kong, silhouetted against the exploding napalm while a Skyraider comes through and 'saves the day.'  That one shot has struck me as false from the first time I saw this.  For that alone, a downgrade of two points to a seven of ten.",8,0,1,12 December 2002
Amélie," Magnifique! Or something like that.
","I doubt I'm the first person to see this as yet another version of Jane Austen's _Emma_, but that's what it is: Do-gooding, romantically inclined girl helps others (although in _Emma_ she's more a match-maker than a general do-gooder and avenger-of-wrongs), is too shy (or in Emma's case, too busy meddling with others) to pursue (recognize) her own potential romantic match, until pushed into it, somewhat, by others.  In _Emma_, it's her step-half-brother-or-something, in _Amelie_, it's a kid who used to get beat up in school who she 'cute-meets' while walking through a Paris railroad station.But enough Film School criticism!  Maybe it's not the perfect 'date movie' -- too many subtitles for that -- but it probably would be if you spoke French.  Charming, *very* funny, off the wall, and -- dare I say it? -- original.  Highly recommended.",9,0,3,8 January 2003
The Sixth Sense," yeah, but ...
