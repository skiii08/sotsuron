Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat should not be missed......
","Borat is by far the funniest movie I have seen this decade. At 82 minutes, the movie is on the short side, but it makes up for this by packing every single minute with gut-busting, roll-on-the-floor laughter. You will be unable to believe some of the outrageous and totally over-the-top things they do in this movie. Another strength of the movie is that despite Borat being an idiot, he is a very endearing character. Borat is a biting satire, using Borat to show the idiocity of racism and hatred. The great thing about this movie is that it has something for everyone. It has intelligent satire, smart dialogue, dumb slapstick humour and everything in between. A word of warning though - do NOT see this movie if you are offended easily - it is easily the edgiest R-rated movie ever made.",9,4,13,4 November 2006
