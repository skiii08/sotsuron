The Ring," disturbing, unsettling and downright creepy.
","I first watched this movie with a couple of friends. To be honest, I was expecting a teenage, slasher flick, I was proved wrong.The film circles around a cursed videotape that causes it's viewers to die in seven days. Investigative journalist, Rachel Keller, begins to uncover the secrets of the videotape, and must race against the clock to save herself.The movie was very unsettling and disturbing, which worked more effectively than some teens getting slashed with axes. The videotape was nightmarish and disturbing, and the images will stay with you long after the movie. The setting was gloomy and atmospheric, which enhanced the mood. Naomi Watts portrayed Rachel perfectly, her emotions are believable and haunting. So if you are looking for a horror flick to watch on Friday night, be sure to watch The Ring, just make sure to watch it at night with the lights off.",9,80,92,24 December 2008
Final Destination," A Standout for it's Genre.
","When I first heard of Final Destination, I was quite skeptical. I was kinda expecting a teen slasher flick with a phsyco killer, but I realized the killers in this movie could be a mug, a bus, a bathtub and a bottle of vodka!, yes, death itself is the maniac killer of the film!The movie circles around Alex Browning, a teen going to Paris with his classmates, but he has a premonition of a deadly explosion in mid-air, he decides to get off, forcing six of his peers off. But in their shock, the plane exploded, just like his vision. After the accident, the people who got off soon begin to die in bizarre accidents, convincing Alex and his peers that death itself is after them, reclaiming the souls that avoided their fate.The film gave me goosebumps and kept me interested throughout. This was, to me, the perfect horror-suspense flick, with an original plot, exciting pace, shocking deaths and believable performances from Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Sean William Scott and Kerr Smith. Although some questions where left unanswered, the film still kept me on the edge of my seat.So if your looking for suspenseful thrills and inventive deaths, Final Destination is the ticket for you!!!9/10",9,0,1,15 July 2009
