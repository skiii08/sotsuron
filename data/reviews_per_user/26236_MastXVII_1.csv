Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great Fun!!
","Wow, Episode I is without a doubt the most entertaining movie I've seen in a long while. All I can suggest is not to get hung up by all of the negative reviews out there condemning it for its poor script, that Lucas has lost some of his 'magical touch,' etc. Go out to see it to have fun and I guarantee that you will not be disappointed. For extra enjoyment, dress up as the Star Wars character of your choice and act like an obsessive maniac at the theater, wielding your lightsaber like a certified Jedi knight. People may look at you funny, but you'll have a blast (I, of course, would never commit such an act, er...). Seriously, Star Wars has always been a great series, and I certainly feel that Lucas has successfully continued that trend through Episode I. Elitists out there will knock it for it's occasionally cheery atmosphere, and compare it unfavorably to the darker Empire Strikes Back. But you know what? I don't care. As long as each Episode continues in the same vein as its predecessors as fascinating, unbelievable tales, then I'll be happy -- which is why I'm so looking forward to Episodes II and III. Congrats to Mr. Lucas for coming up with another great film.",10,0,1,19 May 1999
