Walk the Line," A plane walk with rolling coaster actors
","It's a long (two hours-and-something) walk the one James Mangold put us through, but it's worth to take the ride since Johnny Cash sings in your ears all night while Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon show us what acting is about. The movie has a simple story: the life of a music legend; the actors put some good magic on while Mangold walks with the camera nearby. The director never lets the story or the actors take over the movie or slip away, and the time flows. Mangold doesn't take risks on screen and delivers (that will keep him in the world of blockbusters movies), but it doesn't make him - now - a director worth following.",6,0,0,23 August 2013
Django Unchained," Django Unchained: Dlame - The 'D' is silent
","Nobody cares, all right, but I have to confess a thing before starting this review: the 'Dlame thing' isn't mine, it's a friend of mine that said so, a genius short analysis if I might say. I would stop this writing right there, with that word but IMDb needs ten lines at least, so let's get a bit deeper into the subject. The movie is watchable, and that is a good news because Tarantino is still far above the average, actors are pretty good but only Mr. Jackson and Mr. Waltz reach a high level and the plot stick you to the chair: vengeance on racist. What is missing? Editing! What happened when the camera got back to the rental house and the computer got turned on? Nobody knows but I believe it messed things up. The editor changed and the work isn't good. Who's fault is it? No clue, because in movie making 2+2 is equal to whatever.",6,1,3,24 August 2013
