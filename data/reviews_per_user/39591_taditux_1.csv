The Equalizer," Political movie...
","I give this movie +3 for effects and sound track.There was no story. Actors don't have personality's. And worst thing with this movie? brain washing ???We got Russians as Bad guys ??? Ohh really. We have Black guy as hero, which will save the day ??? It can't be more political then this... And on top of that, main actor is Steven Seagal in black guy body.I hate Steven Seagal movies they are so dumb always. Sorry if i offend someone. I would gladly take my time back, and do nothing, nothing is better then watching this movie.",3,12,24,6 October 2014
