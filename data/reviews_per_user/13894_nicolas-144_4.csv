Black Swan," Black Swan is the ballet version of Showgirls (all text is spoilers)
","When i heard that the ballet manager (V.Cassel) called himself a prick during the audition, i remembered right away the so cruel audition from paul verhoeven's showgirls ; When i've seen N.Portman touching herself I remembered right away the strip scene when Nomi is 'dancing' @ cheetah club,,,whoo this movie is getting hotter & hotter...The way Portman's learning the black-swan thing & somehow looking forward to the perfect ballet is quite the same way Berkley (in showgirls) is willing to do anything against her main obstacle : herself...I'm a guy alright, i guarantee I'v been as much embarrassed in Black Swan than in Showgirls whether you are with a relative,friend or even your girlfriend, to see a nice girl fingering in a big cinema screen for 2 minutes (B.SWAN) whoooooo fortunately the cinema is off light so no one can see ur red head :) but at the end, you get out of the theatre, u surely say to yourself than this was a great movie.",10,1,3,13 February 2011
Iron Man 3," ***Marvel's in his heaven, all's right with the world***
","Good = special effects and surrounding sound mix in cinema and Miguel Ferrer cameo (always reminds me robocop) Bad = everything else : screenplay, dialogue, runtime, villains,soundtracks, casting, the budget, the connections with avengers and previous iron man movies. Result = 1 billion at the worldwide box office and i hope lots of rotten tomatos. Tagline: Unleash the stupidity behind the title Consequences: not even sure willing to watch avengers 2 or other marvel movies. Maybe gonna give a chance to Thor 2 though,,,and make second thought on upcoming robocop remake if they do not push the button too far from the original.",3,4,6,14 May 2013
Fast & Furious 6," Surprising villain / Diesel & Rock / Fast 7
","Just watched it in France, gonna admit it is just explosive and best action movie so far this year: Well balanced timing, good fight featuring Rodriguez, a great tag team tornado match for the grand finally. Don't even think about story line because this kind of movie can make you believe anything as long as punchlines from each characters, punches from the main ones, put a step further to the never seen before one of a kind car chasing (e.g tank vs old cars / aircraft vs muscle cars) You have to remember a wrestlemania like match feat. Rock/Diesel which is as good as Superman/Batman fighting together. Over the top : ending preparing the Fast and Furious team Vs The Transporter : 2014 great year upcoming...",9,14,26,28 May 2013
Fifty Shades of Grey," Just like Showgirls ! Awful movie which will be cult in 10 years
","All audiences laughing from the fall of the virgin mindless girl to the butt slapping, from the erotic punchlines to the last scene in the elevator, letting us at zero shade needing to watch the sequel.Nearly no seat available in the theatre, to watch 2 hours of pointless story, no searching, no acting, no drama, no hot scene, only nice cars (thanks Audi) and oh hairy parts : disgusting after or before a st valentine dinner.You wont be excited after the movie, you'll be smiling because it is so funny after all.Oh and by the way, Showgirls value a 10 out of 10 of course. Thanks Paul Verhoeven, your movie wont be defeated.",9,5,19,14 February 2015
