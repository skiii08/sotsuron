Minority Report," A Big Disappointment!
",Steven Spielberg's Minority Report is the second movie in a row that I have left the movie house feeling very disappointed.  The other movie being AI. I felt MR was searching for direction the whole time and never knew what direction it should take.  At one point I thought they were just trying to be cute with a couple of Indiana Jones type scenes with the tense but slightly humorous John L Williams score and then off into another direction. Great FX but these days that is never enough.  I found serious flaws in this movie.  I am also shocked with the rating most people have given this movie.  In my opinion and that is all it is. I try to see every movie and would not give this movie the rave reviews most have given it. Probably should have been left as a short story.  6 out of 10 at best!,1,4,8,26 June 2002
