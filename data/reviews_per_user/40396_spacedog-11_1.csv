Marie Antoinette," What the...
",This is really quite a good film. While Coppola's Lost In Translation was the most overrated event of it's year it seems Antoinette is going to be the most underrated film of this year. Dunst immortalizes the tragic teenage queen. She embodies this spirit and is being unfairly ridiculed. It is a MASTERFUL performance as is the rest of the cast's!! People who cannot get into this type of film will like this. Reason is the cast is just splendid and the script does not overwhelm with a lot of historical bloating. Do not listen to the haters on this. I guess they wanted a history lesson but me I wanted to be beautifully entertained! Off with Their heads!!,9,3,6,22 October 2006
