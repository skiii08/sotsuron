Alien 3," An Amateur Review: Alien 3
","This movie gets a lot of bad rap from people who highly favor the first two. And for good reason. The people that bash this movie had a right and they are entitled to their opinions because when this movie compared to the first two....it sadly does not stand very well. Let's take a step back for a minute.Alien was a revolutionary horror movie for its time. It had the right mix of Horror and Suspense put in. As well as a terrific since of claustrophobia. The feeling of being cut off from the world and that anything could pop out from around the corner. The acting was terrific the characters were lovable and heck you could even connect with a lot of them. There was real terror in the air.Aliens was also a big surprise to the movie going audience because it was just as good as the original (in my opinion). It took a whole different turn with things. It was just simply a horror flick anymore it was a awesome action movie. Guns and gore galore!! With super awesome characters with likable personality (and yes to an extent even Bill Paxton's character). It had a lot of issues being dealt with especially by Ripley...big issue most notably of course is Motherhood. This movie is definitely a watch if you haven't seen it...anyways on to the main movie.Alien 3 had a lot on its shoulders to begin with just right off the bat. How can one still be able to keep the audience interested after two magnificent films? Well, lets quickly look at the negative aspect of it. It's the beginning. It starts off with the ship containing Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and Bishop and it crash lands on to a 'prison planet'. This is all due to the cause of one alien egg that was on board. First question...how the heck did it get there? Well the movie doesn't really offer and explanation to how it happened we are just suppose to go with it really. And with this happening it makes 'Aliens' pointless. Guess Ripley didn't have to go back for Newt..she was just gonna die anyways. As well as helping out Bishop and Hicks. Bishop is in the film but only for a short while and he doesn't really offer much to the movie but still it is nice to see him. The second problem is some of the characters. The first two movies have memorable characters that had personality and depth. This movie has characters that for the most part go unnamed and right i can't tell you the names simply because i don't remember. I remember the main black guy...the one bald guy that survives...the a''hole leader....and the leader of Weyland Inc. oh yeah and Ripley of course. But that is the only things i cant truly find wrong with the film that really bug me. Other than that i throughly enjoy the film. The atmosphere is dark and gritty. I really feel sheltered off from the world and the total lack of technology really sets in as you get a great perspective of the world around you. The acting (again my opinion) is pretty good. Especially from Ripley herself. The music also sets a pretty eerie tone for the movie as well...most of it being choir music especially the opening scene which sets the mood immediately. This movie was also the first theatrical directorial debut of David Fincher. A Director way ahead of his time and who goes to make such great movies like Fight Club, Seven, Panic Room, Social Network, and of course the most recent remake of Girl with The Dragon Tattoo. Anyways the point I get at is that this film is definitely worth watching and deserves a higher rating than it has currently that is why i give it an eight outta ten. Oh yes and the finale of this movie is fantastic and is where the series should have ended but sadly continued on to make...gulp...Alien resurrection....which plainly sucks...a lot...anyways that's my amateur review of Alien 3...hoped it help ya some...this Amateur Reviewer...signing off.",8,1,1,2 January 2012
