The Incredible Hulk," This movie absolutely blew me away
","WOW....thats all I can say is WOW. I mean holy crap, this movie was so intense. When i first walked into the theaters i didn't know what to expect.(i just saw it today too =]') But boy when i walked out i was just shocked. The movie does take time to get into the big story which i like in movies, and i like how you see Mr. Tony Stark. I also thought that battle at the end was just downright brutal. It was SO much better than the Eric Bana's version. For Hulk fans, you have a great movie right in front of you.They also set up for an Avengers movie, and i cant even say anymore. This movie just blows you away.",10,4,7,14 June 2008
Titanic," This movie is SO boring
","Wow, when i saw this movie (even though i was young) i though it would ACTUALLY be good. Well, was i sorely mistaken. It's like 3 hours of these people trying to 'fall-in-love' when the ship they are on is sinking and everyone around them is dieing. There's another thing, not to be morbid or anything, the BEST part is when the ship is sinking, and for you folks out there who haven't seen it, you have to sit through some boring crap for a long time. There are 3 maybe 4 good parts to the movie. The beginning, then everyone is boarding the ship. For some reason it looks cool, When the giant funnel falls and kills Jack's friend, when the giant dome busts with water, and when the ship snaps in two.So for you folks who haven't seen it yet, i told you the best parts, find them on you tube. Now you owe me, i saved you 3 boring hours of your life you would never have gotten back if you saw it.",5,5,8,14 June 2008
