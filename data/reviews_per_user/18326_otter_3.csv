The Devil's Advocate," Pacino goes OVER the TOP!!
","At first this movie seemed like a decently-made, moderately realistic portrayal of the conflicts in the life of young defense lawyer, marred only by the casting of Keanu Reeves as an intelligent person. But as soon as he's hired away to New York by big shot Al Pacino, things begin to get more interesting... no, make that more melodramatic.For the first hour or two the movie keeps a good tension going as Keanu and wife Charlize Theron find their values, integrity and happiness stripped away one temptation at a time; and their seemingly perfect lives slowly become a living hell. But it's about the time that it becomes obvious that everyone around them is already there that the movie begins to slowly inch over the top.  About when Charlize had hallucinations and whined 'they stole my ovaries!', and Keanu attended a funeral where his co-workers groped each other instead of mourning, and Pacino made some Holy Water boil and laughed like Boris Karloff ('Bwhahahahahahahaha!!') at the ceiling... I stopped thinking about issues of temptation and started giggling - and that was just when the movie got lively.Pacino comes into his own in the last half hour, proving again that there's nothing on Earth more watchable that a big ham actor having the time of his life. He doesn't take it at all seriously, this where he has center stage and all his best lines, and he booms them out with fervid amusement. I've never seen him overact so badly except in 'Looking for Richard' (where he ably demonstrated why nobody's paying him to play Shakespeare), and there the excessive broadness could be excused on the grounds that he really filming a stage role. No excuses this time, it's just plain overacting! As for the other performances, they range from competent to Keanu Reeves. As for the lovely Keanu... I will only say that he... cannot hold his own against the raging torrent that is Pacino, and that the dreadful bogus Southern accent doesn't help him to appear to have more than two neurons to rub together.And just when you were having some major fun with Pacino ... you're deflated by the kind of tacked-on ending that studios insist on when they think the story's right and natural ending will hurt the box-office.  Still, worth a look if you want to be entertained.",Null,0,1,28 April 2000
Meet Joe Black," Brad Pitt strikes again!
","Brad Pitt kills this movie. The movie is slow, it's long, it's almost silent, but those aren't necessarily movie-killers. No, to really kill a movie, you have to get the leading role completely, utterly wrong - like here.It's basically a remake of the old movie 'Death Takes a Holiday', where Death assumes human form, and falls in love. The old movie was from the early days of sound and consequently clumsily made, but had a gothic romanticism that makes it still worth watching. The new version tries for a bit of the same, and came close in some places, but you can't do Gothic Romanticism with a blank like Brad Pitt at the center of the film. It could have been a good film with a decent leading actor, the director had the courage to try for the kind of stillness and quiet that makes the smallest nuances seem vital (a la 'The Innocents' or 'The Sixth Sense'), and for stretches of the film it actually works. It does get you to actually get into the relationships between the characters, the silence really does draw you in - when it works.But some actors can't stand that kind of scrutiny - Brad Pitt being one. Death was written as having a mix of utter innocence (new to humanity and all that) and terrible depths - which HAD to be played by an actor who's at least capable of registering feeling in a close-up! For this movie to work at all the endless close-ups needed to be fascinating - we needed to watch the thoughts, feelings, and depths playing through Death's eyes. But neither thoughts, feelings, nor depths play through Pitt's eyes, nothing plays through Pitt's eyes, except a vague awareness that he looks good. All the close-ups of Brad looking clueless (the closest he can come to innocent) do not fascinate, instead he looks deeply stupid!If you want to see a good movie with Death as a character don't see this, see 'The Seventh Seal' or the original 'Death Takes a Holiday' or Woody Allen's 'Love and Death'... or even 'Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey' Â– which is a way better movie than this.",Null,1,2,1 January 2001
Jerry Maguire," Made by yuppie scum, for yuppie scum. DIE YUPPIE SCUM!!
","Big cheese sports agent Tom Cruise is struggling to find meaning in his lucrative shark-in-a-suit, love-em-and-leave-em, what's-my-client's-name-again existence. In a fit of what passes for normality in this movie he writes a 'shocking' Mission Statement and loses his job. His only supporters are his sole client Cuba Gooding Jr., and lowly clerical worker Renee Zellweger, who works for him for apparently no salary, takes him home to her sister and sickly little boy, and of course falls in love with him. Of course Tom has to redeem himself and prove he's worthy of Renee by the most meaningful challenge the writers could think of (one that's undoubtedly near and dear to their hearts) - getting his overpaid client millions and millions of dollars instead of just millions of dollars.The first thing that I can't stand about the movie is that it's deadly serious about all those buzzwords and management fads that make my teeth crawl in real life. Like how Tom loses his job over a Really Important Mission Statement - have you ever known an actual working human being (not a yuppie) who takes those things seriously? And the way Tom constantly uses the phrase 'Customer Service' to make his firing worthwhile and give meaning to his shallow existence. In the real world 'Customer Service' has an entirely different meaning: It's a terrifying buzzword that inhuman managers use to mean 'I don't just want 8 hours of work from my employees - I want to control every aspect of their behavior, I want to micromanage away their individuality, I want their very souls!'. And the writers seem to think it's inspirational.Tom Cruise is as slick and shallow as Cameron Crowe's direction, all dazzling grins and big-eyed vulnerable looks photographed from the most flattering angle, his usual Star performance. The supporting cast is excellent, in fact much better than the two leads. Bonnie Hunt as Renee's bitter sister has all the good lines and shares scene-stealing honors with five-year-old Jonathan Lipnicki, a genuinely cute child actor, and the lively and charming Cuba Gooding Jr. But it's Renee Zellweger's `Dorothy' who delivers the other killer blow to what might have been a good. better film. The character is the most annoying female lead of recent years. She's introduced on an airplane where the audience is supposed to feel sorry for her because she has to fly coach! Where she isn't given ONE glass of champagne, oh da poor widdle ting!  Face it, her character is truly gullible and dimwitted, and like many badly written female characters, never talks about her own needs, just what she can do for Jerry.  She's not a written as a person, she and her kid are just there to allow Jerry The Jerk to show his vulnerable, caring side - in relationships that are 100% All About Him. (Plus she strongly reminds me of some real-life women who act vulnerable and self-sacrificing, and are in fact manipulative bitches)In short, if you like this film you probably are or aspire to be the kind of yuppie who inspired the catchphrase 'Die Yuppie Scum'. Let this movie serve not as entertainment, but as a test and a wake-up call. If you enjoy it at all, or identify with Tom, or even go through the whole film without ever once wanting to hit any of these people - change your life immediately! It may not be too late for you to rejoin the human race!DIE YUPPIE SCUM!!!",Null,0,4,4 January 2001
