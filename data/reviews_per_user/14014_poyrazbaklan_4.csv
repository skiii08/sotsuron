Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," do not judge a book by its....never mind
","OK, first of all I haven'r read the book, but I know it is from the same writer that gave us pride and prejudice and zombies so I can easily say it has the same amount of silliness contained within. It is just that taking random pieces of history and rewriting them with supernatural is kind of a good idea, if done right. Not here. Lincoln vs the zombies is very...very stupid. Granted it has good special effects and some minor star power does not give it the gusto that you may expect from a one time flick. It does have some action, a little comic relief and some plot but it doesn't have anything else. It can be summed up as, boy knows vampires exist, boy learns how to fight them, he grows up, then becomes president(that is a spoiler, Abe Lincoln becomes a president) and fights some more vampires. Oh and he literally becomes the president in just one scene, it is like in five minutes its ten years later and he is running the country, civil war and all. And the south is so evil they employ vampires, too. In any case you can watch it with a couple friends and beer but there is not much fun to be had.",4,0,2,23 December 2012
The Bourne Legacy," Great addition to Bourne franchise
","I actually had not much hope for this film. The Bourne trilogy is over, the case is closed and there sjould be no more movies, right? Wrong. Expectedly, after Treadstone is compromised due to Jason Bourne's actions, other super agents are left to fend for themselves. I actually don't understand the clandestine government organizations that spend millions on these superhuman agents and then pull the plug in the slightest danger and try to kill them all. I mean, relocating them or even giving them other assignments would be enough but noo they have to send men after them in order to keep it all a secret. I first thought Jeremy Renner(who I doubted would be a good addition to the action genre, and now he kind of makes me take my word back)would be replacing Matt Damon. But then I found out that this is more of a side story and actually liked the plot. The movie starts out slow but then after the first half exponentially picks up the pace and ends with a great chase sequence in Manila. Rachel weisz is impressive as the lab geek, and Edward Norton is well cast as the ruthless investigator. I also hoped Stacy Keach would have more screen time but it was apparently cut down due to the films long running time.(a little more than 2 hrs)The duo of Renner and Weisz does not have the same electricity between them but they still act well and the action shots, most of them looks like they were done in one take, are very good. And the final, rather mysterious super agent antagonist was very well cast. The only thing I did not like was the action takes soo long to pick up but I guess it was necessary to see what has become after Bourne raised a sh.t storm among the government organizations. Give this one a chance, you won't regret",7,10,15,6 December 2012
Here Comes the Boom," incredibly average
","First of all, when you hear Kevin James, the lovably clumsy chubby guy, doing an mma movie, you no doubt will have doubts. It sure is a comedy but how will he pull it off? Will it be about him going in the cage and doing slapstick routines or maybe the movie will fit the fight scenes in a montage and focus on the comedic parts. Apparently it's not, James sure pulls it off and although it is kind of unbelievable to see him do roundhouse kicks, the fight scenes are decent to watch. Yet, the rest of the movie..just...isn't. This has been done before, in the perfectly average nacho libre, which in turn was inspired by the true story of Fray Tormenta. People are wrong about complaining how the jokes in this movie aren't funny, because there are hardly any jokes at all. It is rather set up as an inspiring movie, just short of drama, with some scenes of james falling down or getting punched, just to make it more comedic. Other than the 'teacher needs money for school so he fights' setting, there is no story to speak of. I think the producers just thought about putting Fonzi, Kevin james and mma fighters in a room and waited for hilarity to ensue, and it just didn't happen. Though henry winkler is a little over the top with his devoted music teacher attitude and including Bas rutten is also a nice touch, the rest of the movie is in shambles. It is not bad, it just isn't a comedy, or simply not good enough.",4,7,13,13 February 2013
Sinister," The trailer gives away all the scares!
","I had high hopes for Sinister. Its trailer looked scary enough with decent actors (and Ethan Hawke) and some terrifying jump scares. The main evil, Bughuul, is horrible enough with his looks and the murders, so I jumped in the chance to see the movie. But alas! The scenes in the trailer consists of the only scary scenes in the whole movie. There is definitely nothing else, the remaining 85 minutes consist of Ethan Hawke slowly going crazy and his relationship with his wife(who I might add is somehow scarier than Bughuul with her non-stop complaining and whiny discouragement) deteriorating. Sure there is an evil on the loose and going after this man's family but I would rather see the scary scenes than watch what this does to him. Long story short, when you see the trailer, you have seen enough.",4,0,2,2 December 2012
