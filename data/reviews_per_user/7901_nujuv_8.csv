The Avengers," Blockbuster tosh from mega nerd Whedon...
","****SMALL SPOILERS**** I'm simplifying, but only a little bit.This guy - on track record - should not be able to make films like this.He seems to fly in the face of convention - a man who appears to have an absolute passion for comic book nonsense, yet still comes up with twists of character AND manages to squeeze several massive egos (in terms of character and I dare say actors) onto the same film AND ALSO gets Disney to pony up a mega budget to do so.This just does not happen.And just to give two fingers to movie execs and critics alike - it is well written, chock full of jaw dropping set pieces and well acted.Please note some of the best performances are from people in tin suits and glittery Halloween costumes. That's how good it is.It makes you suspend your disbelief and get drawn in to a very strong parallel to modern politics - who exactly are the 'villians' anyway? - whilst managing to keep cringing moments of sentiment - see any Michael Bay flick - pretty much at arms length.Most notable are moments of the Whedon trade mark - from Firefly in particular - where he totally goes against viewer expectations with regard to conflict outcomes.Loki vs the Hulk is particularly brilliant on that front.It's a big movie. It's completely over the top comic book action and a small miracle it is as good as it is.My only gripe would be a few cheesy lines and the old US cliché of 'English accent = skinny villain' thing, but this is one hell of an action movie and a pretty good film in it's own right.AND I don't even worship Marvel stuff. Horay for fat nerds everywhere.",8,1,5,6 May 2012
Underworld," bad gone lazy
","Controversy and lawyer bait aside, this film pulls on every cliche in the books and fails to bring anything new to the genre.  Beckinsales' character is hopeless as the poor little rich assasin.  Even before the 'revelation' about her hatred for lycans (?) comes out, a seasoned cornball junky will see the scene coming and probably even guess the words - never mind the 'twist' at the end.Wolf effects are good, vamps seem to be portrayed as gun totting goths with huge clothing budgets - nothing new or imaginative is added to one of the most intriguing horror characters in history.  This is a real lame duck. If it wasn't for Kates paint on togs, I'd have walked.  badbadbad.  And the brainless voiceover - sweet mercy...",Null,0,0,20 September 2003
Public Enemies," what you want will limit this...
","... and Mr MANN appears to be getting lazy.This film looks great. As usual, MANN shows an obsession with gritty violence and gun play. DILLINGER is a legnedary character, and unfortunately there is 0 effort in answering questions about his character or deeper motives.I cant emphasise enough how good this film looks.It just about carries it, but it shouldn't.This is a major movie about a major period in US history......and it seems more concerned with gunplay and period buildings.The characters - including DEPPs' turn - are very shallow. There is very little development and it is hard to care about them either way.Damn shame.",6,0,2,5 July 2009
The Thing," why Oscars will never recognise horrors is EFFIN beyond me
","SMALL SPOILERS This film is an awesome film.AN - AWESOME- FILM Never mind the mind blowing, age defying special effects.Never mind the horror/sci fi concept of a creature that violently copies its' victims.Never mind the homage/remake factor of paying homage to 'IT CAME FROM...' style movies.THIS IS AN AWESOME FILM! The script is tight and gives a convincing frame to the visual shocks.The cinematography plays tricks and entices and confronts the viewer.The soundtrack is underscored, yet foreboding - enhancing the action.The performances are solid - swaying between cliché and convincing in a totally competent manner.It ticks all the boxes for an awesome FILM. Because it is an awesome film.First and foremost.Horror and sci fi are sadly sidelined. An awesome film is an awesome film. Not for the squeamish, but see it.",10,10,15,26 April 2010
The Departed," no goodfellas
","I folk can remember the impact of Scorceses (spellink?) Goodfellas and a fine (if violent) film it is. The Departed will probably be hailed as a return to that fine form, but I hope folk are paying carefull attention, because apart from a few notable one liners, it really is too much the remake and not an individual film.The story is complelling enough, but not enough twist potential is made of the rich characters created in this version - which has always been the directors strength. Jack Nicholson, however, seems a bit reigned in, leaving acting credits to Leonardo for the main cast, but the supporting cast pulls some surprising irons out of the fire. Alec Baldwin as the furious sweaty police captain and Martin Sheen as the proverbial good cop show there is more to casting than who is popular at the time.Good but not fab.",7,1,3,8 October 2006
Sherlock Holmes," much better than i expected, me old china plate
","Very good.I thought this - from the ad - was going to be a steam punk atrocity + ghosts and monsters running around, sort of capper.The look and feel is great - dirty and grimy across the board, with some great touches with regard to Holmes' analysis of situations coupled with a darker observation on his 'appetites'.The best bit of this film is that it stays true to the original stories - I can say no more than that without ruining it.A major leap for Ritchie - he seems to have being trying to continue a franchise (Lock Stock..., Snatch, etc.) for so long, and failing, and has suceeded in creating a new one against numerous odds....psychological recovery, six months.",8,2,5,27 December 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Merchandisers! Merchandisers on wings!
","Well, if I see another Hollywood moomoo-kerching movie, please kick me in the nuts. It was kind of inevitable that I would be seeing this thing. Come to think of it, this film is likely to be seen by most of the planet - is there a point in reviewing it at all? Folk will see it regardless. Oh well... Saying this film continues where the second movie finished deserves a slap, but in case the first two missed you it's worth saying that this the last of a trilogy of stories by JRR Tolkien. It is remarkable as a project, as it has taken 8 or so years to be made. It was originaly meant to be one film. Just goes to show that some movie companies couldn't see money in a bank. It concerns the fate of a fictional world called Middle Earth, which sits on the verge of a peacefull age of mortal men (if they can pull themselves together) or slavery and destruction under a long forgotten sorcerer called Sauron and his associates of focused villainry... and there is this ring which has the power to bend all peoples to the wishes of whoever wears it - but only Sauron can wield it without going insane, as his will is part of the power of the ring.The stories have a wonderful strength of creating compelling characters and situations that wouldn't be out of place in a religious creation myth or saga. They have a weakness in that too much history is crammed in (there would have been a lot more - see Silmarillion), making reading them very labourious in places. So far, this negative hasn't come across too bad in the films. The first one seemed to skirt around some of the meatier parts of the story (racial friction and old alliances), and only came alive at the end. The second had a much better pace and more interesting things going on in the character department, and the third one?It begins strongly with a reiteration of Smeagol/Golom's bitter-pathetic character, and tells the story of Minas Tirith pretty well. It kicks off with some compelling battles (seems more tied in with the story than 'ooo, look what CGI can do' which dogged the second flick) and metaphors of human greed and insecurity with the (unfortunately ham city) Steward of Gondor. The whole deal with Shelob (not for arachnaphobes) is perfectly timed - not the 'run-run-run - SCAREY SCAREY - run-run-stab' caper I was fearing.But I say these things as a Nerd of the Rings. As a film, it amazes me in that where it succeds in making fantasy hokum (eg: a ring that controls minds) an endearing concept, it fails in making the lead characters - the nine of the fellowship - seem like they have anything in common when there is nothing chasey-fighty going on. Only Frodo and Sam beat this trend. I have an alarming theory that a lot of the character development in these films is only visible in Special Edition DVDs. I imagine that this is out of presumptions of what will sell to the punters and that more cash can be made from these Special Editions. The main thing that makes me concentrate upon this apparant trend is that a key scene with Saruman (Cristopher Lee) was chopped from the start that would have made the movie make greater sense in places. With my cynics hat on, ther were several parts of this film that seem to be missing bits that would be only realy missed by those that have read the books - but still would have made the film richer and more balanced.It feels a bit patchy in key places, but very strong in others - which always amazes me (and p***es me off): just because there is some wonderful skill and imagination put into some parts, film makers can't just botch and gloss over other sections of film. As a bonus, it never digresses from what I feel is the main theme of the books - togetherness and understanding is strength, and answers to great problems can be found in the most insignificant of places. Naivities or truisms, anyway. Annoyed and elated was I as I elbowed my way out of my local multiplex. Visions of impossible war Oliphants meeting Elven smartarse tactics and warriors from beyond the beyond filled my imagination. Thoughts of whether Ian 'I'm gay you b*****d' McKellen will win the much coveted Best Wobbly Lip in a Wizard oscar and was Frodo copping a feel of Sam's ample buttock played upon my mind as I compared it to my expectations. It stuns, it amuses, it inspires, it falls short - but who cares? You've already decided to see it anyway. One franchise to rule them all...",Null,0,0,19 December 2003
V for Vendetta," not in the slightest bit what so ever what I thought it would be like in the slightest
","***tiny spoilers, perhaps****Woooooo oNIce of the Wachowski Bros to make up for ballsing up the Matrix (first is the only one I recognise for all time - the other turned into the worst movie franchise ever... I should save ranting for the boards). Being a fanboy, I am sad to have missed the original Alan Moore comic (its what they are - deal with it). I think it was something to do with the grinning Guy Fawkes reminding me too much of the whole batman/joker thing... wasn't too fond of Batman at the time... thought it was a rip off... but that's my problem. I've heard bits of the story have been tinkered with, but this film deals with some seriously heavy themes and any off the cuff comparrisons to the Man in the Iron Mask, Phantom of the Opera, Spartacus etc do it a discredit. It acknowledges it's sources and pays homage by giving them a somber twist, the end result is a tale of holocaust that can't be highjacked by comparisons to WWII. The London setting is still refreshingly odd and the look and feel has a convincing air, with just the right tint of something is well wrong here. It reminds me of Brazil - for perhaps obvious reasons - and I would urge people to see both of these films as they give a vision of what any controlling system is capable of if allowed to go to extremes and I hope will encourage people to have a stake in society, rather than turn a blind eye or throw their toys out of the pram when things go wrong. To much for a movie? I think not. As is a theme of in this film, it is a function of art to point at truths with fiction, Or something like that.Looks great - Weaving, Rea and Fry are brilliantly cast and give fine turns accordingly, though Mr Hurt is under used and the character is somewhat hamfistedly done - but the mood and script make for a compelling and haunting movie that could have been soooo bad. How they got lines like 'I had three years of roses' to work has got to be some sort of miracle. Fine fine stuff. See it.",9,2,5,18 March 2006
