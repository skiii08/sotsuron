Casablanca," Don't wait any longer!
","A friend of mine was shocked to hear that I, at 24, had not seen this movie. She practically made me borrow a copy and see this on video.>What can I say, I should have seen it a long time ago. The setting is wonderful, the acting superb. If there ever were two lovers in the world, Bergman and Bogart are portraying them. It makes you wish you had a moment where you could say: We'll always have Paris...",10,1,1,20 April 2000
The Usual Suspects," Check your trivia knowledge...
",I'm not even going to comment on the enormous twist to this story. The story of Keyser Soze is great but I will focus on another part of the Film: All the rip offs and references alone make it worth watching. You notice something new every time. I showed it to my English class (being a teacher...) and most of them loved it...  and since they had seen different films the discussion about references went on for a very long time. A recommendation to all you teachers out there!,8,0,2,20 April 2000
Amélie," As feel-good as it gets
","This movie is an injection of energy and joy. Amélie is a wonderful girl with an alternative upbringing which forms Amélie into the inventive girl she is. After giving a man some of his youth back, Amélie decides to bring happiness and justice to anyone she can help. She both fails and succeeds. But when it comes to her own happiness, she needs a bit of help from her friends...The actors in this film are marvellous and I would like to praise the supporting actors who I find are making a tremendous performance. Everyone from the failed writer to the man of glass.",9,1,3,25 October 2001
