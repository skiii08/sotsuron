The Ring," Ring around my soul-sy
","I never saw this in the theatre because I was a fan of the Koji novel and thought the Ringu series kind of was...ummm...lacking. On a recent Saturday night, bored in my flat, I decided to give her a look. And what a sexy beast this film is. The script is a mess, but the visual style of gore verbinski has made me a believer of anything he directs. The horse/boat scene alone is worth ten pounds...some sequences freaked my knickers and I wondered how this got a 15 certificate over here. Overall, this is an outstanding visual feast. The acting is top notch and Brian Cox is a delight to see in most anything. Naomi is as beautiful as ever and Martin Henderson seems to be a decent up and coming actor as long as he stays away from dreck like that motorcycle flick he did a couple years ago.",10,0,1,20 April 2006
The Sixth Sense," phucking ripoff of a classic novel
","shame on you m. night for ripping off richard matheson's greatly superior novel and not giving him reference. You are a hack director that creates nullifying films that the masses are brainwashed through your slight of hand. Disney has seen the error in their ways of falling for your false three act structure of films and has happily cancelled your contract. Woohoo. How much did you settle out of court for stealing the children's book and claiming 'the village' as your own? Curious to know. Why does Hollywood continue to buy into your blasphemous film-making? I cannot understand why you have no original thoughts in your head. It's almost as if you're cutting and pasting great films, story lines and themes. Please stop doing this or at least acknowledge your source material.",1,6,16,25 April 2006
