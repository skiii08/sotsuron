Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great-looking, otherwise empty
","Something about PHANTOM MENACE seems unfinished.  With all the time and much of the money in the world, Lucas has fashioned a movie which engages the eye much more than the heart (except anger, perhaps justified, at the shameless exploitation manifest in Jar Jar Binks).  Palpatine is good as a sort of Iago, coming off as the most fully realized character -- which is not saying much.Lucas was brave to make what is essentially a socio-political film about taxation and blockades, but he should have salted the thing with characters we might actually care about.  Nobody is bad here, but no one really has a chance to shine, either.  Harrison Ford jumped off the screen in the first -- er, fourth -- film, and Alec Guiness was very impressive; here, the players are rather dull and flat.  This hurts.Perhaps all this will be more interesting in retrospect, when the second and third installments are released.  Still, the movie needs to be able to stand on its own, and this one, with some pleasures, is oddly lifeless.",5,0,1,21 June 1999
The Big Lebowski," Unexplainably entertaining
","This movie means absolutely nothing, goes absolutely nowhere; the pitch hovers somewhere around vulgar, and every character is a flake.  How, then, is it so entertaining?Jeff Bridges holds the thing together like glue.  He plays the unflappable Dude -- who gets flapped aplenty -- with such wit and grace that he pulls off plenty of schtick, making this cartoon utterly believable and convincing.  (Oh ho! -- he writes checks for less than a dollar!  He smokes a joint and says 'bummer'!  He lives to bowl and yet never rolls!)  The Coens were dead right to cast Bridges; any actor who misstepped would have sunk the ship.Even still, a quarter or more of the scenes don't work, but what does is very entertaining, very funny.  Probably as much foul language per frame as GOOD WILL HUNTING, but at least here it seems to make sense; the Coens don't cram it into everyone's mouths unilaterally.",7,1,2,2 July 1999
Memento," haunting and powerful
","I'll be a gentleman and not spoil anything, but I would like to address a criticism I've heard, which is that MEMENTO is a hollow exercise lacking emotional substance.  I think the film is haunting, and that would be enough, but when we reach the denouement -- the beginning of the story -- we see that Nolan has something powerful to say about how rage can motivate us to do the things we do.  There's a series of decisions Leonard makes in that scene which he knows he'll forget, and those decisions are recognizably human, and there's some terrific reverberation, particularly to a scene in which Natalie goes out to a car to wait.  Obviously I'm being obtuse, but those who have seen the movie will know what I'm speaking of, and probably agree.  I was stunned and thrilled by this one, and my friend and I had a great time hashing things out afterward.  And you know, we still don't know for sure on some points, and that's great.",9,0,0,2 April 2001
L.A. Confidential," wildly overrated
","The most overrated movie since LEAVING LAS VEGAS.  Wildly improbable plot turns, especially the bedding of the hooker.  A ridiculous contraption. Take a gander at the memorable quotes page for this entry; if that looks like good writing, I've got some leftover Shane Black screenplays for sale.Comparisons to CHINATOWN indicate that, well, the reviewer is just desperate for something as good as that classic.  A double feature would swiftly reveal this to be the hollow pretender that it is.",3,11,29,30 June 1999
Sleepy Hollow," has its problems, but pretty terrific
","(This review includes spoilers.  Not MAJOR spoliers, but spoilers nevertheless.)SLEEPY HOLLOW may not be quite great, but it's pretty close.  Burton works with one if his better - if somewhat conventional - scripts, and that helps; if there is a dash of Simpson/Bruckheimer plot device, at least there's none of the muddiness of Tim's BATMAN films.  Johnny Depp is terrific as Ichabod Crane - seems this very versatile actor can do little wrong - and his humorous scenes somehow blend nicely with the very creepy Horseman moments. Usually, directors strain to achieve horror/comedy and it doesn't quite come off; SLEEPY HOLLOW manages this well.  The campy elements work fine.Some of the scenes - I'm thinking particularly of the flashbacks - aren't necessary and slow the pace slightly.  But other details are terrific: the Horseman has a terrific signature flip he performs with his sword just before he strikes; I imagine we can thank Ray Park for that. 
-- The Horseman.  Burton and his actors (more than one play the part) manage to make this villain a fully-formed character.  Indeed, I believed him more after his beheading than before.  The first time we see him leaping horseback from his lair is astonishing; the charging tilt of his sword is beautiful and frightening -- almost noble in determination.Much has been made of the cinematography, and rightly so.  The film is shot in dusty, washed out earth tones and purples, and I enjoyed seeing the occasional dashes of color - one book among a pile drawing the eye.  And the splashes of color: yes, the blood does stand out, and this one's not for the squeamish; I was cringing and curling away from the screen more than once.An interesting note: there's the fashionable Christian-bashing going on (why are ministers always adulterers, torturers, or child molesters?), yet a house of God is the one place the Horseman can't enter.  Doesn't stop him, though; this is a crafty Hessian from Hell.",8,0,0,25 November 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The worst Star Wars film to date
","I'm stunned that so many people like this movie.  Lucas has linked a few psuedo-set pieces together, drained all of his actors of the least shred of charisma, and used horrible dialogue, motivation, and plot advances as the mortar.  Yes, an awful lot of the dialogue from the earlier movies was poor, but folks like Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Alec Guiness, James Earl Jones, and Peter Cushing made it work.  Here, none of the story works -- everything is absolutely on the nose.SPOILERS:  There are huge problems with the characters behaving inconsistently with the framework.  Amidala needs to go into hiding and so hands her vote over to the one person who has proved most unreliable in the past?  Anakain was a fiesty but basically okay kid in PHANTOM MENACE, and now ten years of the universe's most elevated spiritual training has turned him into an insufferable, reblious brat?  Obi-Wan stumbles onto a planet which is hatching a conspiracy, and the aliens basially just lay out the welcome mat and guide him through everything, entirely unsuspicious of his obvious ignorance? -- after they haven't seen any money or had any communication with their employer in ten years?  Yoda suddenly turns into a rabid ferret, incredibly agile and limber, only to sigh and return to limping about with his walking stick when the fight is over? Monsters just happen to attack the prisoners' chains first, freeing them for a fight?I could go on and on.  This was the first Star Wars movie in which I was actually bored the entire time.  The only thing that kept me from walking out was that so many people had written about the last thirty minutes or so being incredible.  It wasn't, except in terms of hubris.  RETURN OF THE JEDI was a silly, hammy mess, but it had drive; PHANTOM MENACE was terribly flat, but it was at least interesting; ATTACK OF THE CLONES is empty, soulless, and visually packed in a way which cries desperation.There is one moment of wit -- one.  Obi-Wan encounters a man in a bar selling deathsticks (subtle, eh?).  He performs his mind trick on the man, sending him home to rethink his life.  That was funny, and that was all.",3,0,0,30 June 2002
Forrest Gump," overlong, one-idea movie
","I suppose that because FORREST GUMP uses fantastic technology to trot out its one joke and gimmick again, it gave the illusion of somehow being original.  The feather and the feather only is great in this movie; the rest is capable at best (Hanks' performance, some of the cinematography) and hackneyed at worst.  This is the sort of movie, like THE SOUND OF MUSIC, which cues its sentiment so strongly it's insulting.  It's interesting to take a movie like this and compare it with something like BIRDY (which has certain thematic similarities); BIRDY's premise is so much more far-fetched, and yet the movie has an authenticity GUMP can't manage.  Almost everyone involved here has done better, if not stellar, work elsewhere.",4,1,2,2 July 1999
Cast Away," good idea, wobbly execution: spoilers?
","The premise for this one intrigued me, then I went and saw the darned thing. Hanks gets stranded and we see his ingenuity as he figures out some survival skills and befriends a volleyball; this seems to take place over a period of maybe a week, maybe a month.  Cut: four years later, and he's the master of the universe, Crusoe-style.  It's a jarring leap, and I felt a little cheated.  Sure, I could fill in some gaps and surmise this or that, but... Then he's off the island on a treacherous journey and loses his volleyball.  Sorry, but I never fully bought that, and when he's screaming furiously and choking sobs over this loss, I had to wonder why he never developed a similar affection for the photo of his fiance.  Just a thought. His return and reconnection with the fiance (Helen Hunt) are absolutely awful.  Hollywood and Hanks are actually expecting her to break up her home to run off with him; when Hanks realizes she won't, his tone is accusatory. Not to worry; there's another dame, another tide rolling in, so he can trade off.  Yech.",5,0,2,23 December 2000
Being John Malkovich," Interesting; pretty far from great
","BEING JOHN MALKOVICH has an interesting premise with implications it follows unerringly.  It also has an unfortunate core of unpleasantness -- a cast of characters almost entirely with negative qualities, ranging from pathetic to evil -- which hurts quite a bit, I think.  I don't wonder that these folks would be desperate to shuck off their own personas for fifteen minutes, or that their own morality would allow them to exploit Malkovich; what would have been interesting is the idea of the decent person seduced by such an idea -- that might have led to a Hitcockian setup in which the hero is often 'punished' for being bored and wishing something, anything, would happen. 
There are funny jokes and great touches here and there: Malkovich tries the portal himself to hilarious effect; Diaz's character bumping her head and she moves murderously through a doorway.  Overall, the movie is overrated probably because it succeeds in not being stupid, and there are genuine surprises.  Could become a cult film, or be properly revisited and dismissed much as WILD AT HEART was.",5,1,2,30 October 1999
Pearl Harbor," unbelievably poor in every way
","I just lost three hours plus travel time on this movie, so I'll be brief here to spare myself a bit.I'd read the reviews and properly lowered my expectations because a couple of friends wanted to see PEARL HARBOR.  Even those lowered expectations weren't met.  This souless thing... yeesh.  Blows every opportunity it has. It saps the buildup toward the Japanese attack of any mounting sense of dread, manages to make four love stories unbelievable (including Ben and Josh's -- hey, folks, 'best buddies' is a love story whether you like it or not), makes the full-on attack pretty tensionless, and insults the first decorated black soldier by pinning it on him while he's still alive.  Jon Voight is pretty good as FDR, I'll say that, but even his makeup in his first scene is bad enough to be pretty distracting (it smooths out later).My buddies wanted to see it for the action, and we all came away disappointed.  The cinematography is mostly expert, though the decision to use a flawed lens in a key hospital sequence was, well, flawed.  It muddled things to have characters drifting in and out of focus as they moved about in the frame, and rather than evoking (as TRAFFIC did), it distracts.  Brave idea, though.I dearly hope I've put someone off seeing this.  My sacrifice will have been worth it.  And if you've decided you'll just wait for the video, I'd strongly suggest not even bothering then.  It really is that poor: poor of imagination, poor of craft, poor of humanity.  With an epic war movie and love story, this kills.",2,0,0,26 May 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," fine, fast, and funny
","The wire work takes a little getting used to; sometimes it seems unintentionally comic.  The times when I was most sold on it where when a character would race up the side of a wall, spinning, the wall suddenly the plane which the ground would have been.  This makes the most sense; if, to whatever degree, we're dispensing with gravity, then why is all of the flying simply up/down rather than on other planes?That aside, the story is quite good even if I have some reservations about the ending.  That ending probably reads differently to Westerners than Easterners; what we see as a final selfish act might be considered noble halfway around the world.  Regardless -- good acting (especially by the fellow who plays Lo) and a good dose of humor throughout keeps things pumping.  Good stuff, among the year's ten best.",8,0,0,23 December 2000
The Insider," Probably the best of 1999
","I dallied for so long before seeing THE INSIDER, and, especially after seeing it, I have no real idea why.  Was I afraid of a socio-screed against cigarette companies?  Al Pacino acting up several storms?My advice -- having now seen it twice -- is to view this one while it's still in the theater.  This is the sort of intelligent, gripping movie Hollywood produces when it's at its best.  Like QUIZ SHOW, DONNIE BRASCO, CITY HALL, and SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER, THE INSIDER has a tight, tight script, moves at a great pace, offers an insightful story about humans, and has terrific performances and cinematography.  Michael Mann pushes the quasi-documentary camerawork perhaps just a bit too much for some tastes; I thought it was terrific.  A very deep nod of approval to Russell Crowe.  This is the sort of subtle acting that I don't think most folks realize is so special.  He details his performance so beautifully, even pushing up his glasses perfectly in character.  I could see both the reserved southern gent in him as well as the man who has a problem managing his anger.  The only time it doesn't completely work -- and I would suggest it was a writing and directing problem -- is in a scene in which he is badgered to get on the telephone. His sudden explosion is more a movie mannerism than a glimpse of reality; little matter, though, as he quickly makes the scene work.  A terrific performance from Christopher Plummer, too.  (And Al does fine, keeping the ham largely off the plate.)The only movie that touches this one in 1999 is THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY (or, much more arguably, TOY STORY 2 and THE STRAIGHT STORY).  THE INSIDER is more than worth checking out; it's something of a treasure.",10,0,0,11 February 2000
Quiz Show," brilliant
","I'm not sure why I'm so surprised that Redford made such a great film; ORDINARY PEOPLE is compelling, and certainly a showcase for great acting. But QUIZ SHOW is superlative.Much of the thanks can go to the screenwriters, who have fashioned a script which is fascinating, full of great scenes, rigorous, and propulsive.  The opening scene sets up the conundrum: we are a people who often smirk at what we're being sold (either in media or by other salesmen); still, we buy it, knowing full well it just ain't so.Paul Scofield is astonishing; Ralph Fiennes is outstanding.  Rob Morrow's accent is unstable, but otherwise he's not bad.  Redford's direction -- in spots, influenced by Scorsese (who has a good cameo) -- is nice and tight. Very good production design, as well.A very wise decision was made to move the father/son confrontation (the son's confession) from a restaurant to the father's classroom.  The Shakespeare-toned verbal sparring is wonderful, and when Scofield protests 'your name is my name!' the impact is formidable.  Later, when the parents are standing by their son after his testimony, a reporter notes that the academics are meeting to discuss whether or not to let Charlie go; Scofield's brave face crumbles in such a way that we see the father hadn't even really considered this possibility, and a new nightmare is beginning to unfold.QUIZ SHOW is a movie with fierce intelligence.  It succeeds wildly because it isn't some bland, filmed thesis; it's a fast, smart piece of real entertainment.  One of the best films I've ever seen.",9,3,5,28 April 1999
Shrek," not bad, but, jeez, settle down, folks
","The animation is pretty terrific in Shrek, but the story is fairly straightfoward, marginal stuff.  I don't know why critics and audiences trip over themselves to overpraise stuff like this and Chicken Run (which was a smidgen better than Shrek), and God, don't get me started on Spy Kids, Leaving Las Vegas, or L.A. Confidential.  I simply have to think that the audience isn't as saturated in film and plot as I might be, and critics are so desperate for anything worthwhile that The English Patient starts looking really, really good.Okay, so that's getting more personal than I usually like to be, so let's get on to the movie itself.  Naw, let's just summarize: if you can grab a matinee and keep your expectations in check (the Emperor wears SOME clothes), this is a decent amusement.  That's about it.  I burst out laughing once, precisely (a certain scene involving a bird and its nest of eggs), and caught a few grins here and there.  Word has been spread that the delight of Shrek is that it constantly does the unexpected; I simply can't agree.  That sort of mania happens precisely once (see above); everything else I saw coming before I'd bought my ticket.  It does its thing fairly well, but the main attraction here is the rendering process.",7,0,0,21 May 2001
Before Sunrise," lovely, engrossing
","There was a fellow whose home videos invariably annoyed me.  One day I realized why; each time a conversation began -- something beyond 'Hi, mom!' and waving -- the tape would cut and the next scene would begin.One begins to wonder -- does this person even LIKE people?  Apparently the stuff of real life seems too dull for some, and they need Entertainment; the amperage on that entertainment has to keep going up and up, also, because we develop immunity toward all of our fixes.  Thus, we wind up with ARMAGEDDON, GODZILLA, et al, or soap opera hysterics; everything pushing the envelope just so we can feel a little (and recognize a movie's cues to us).I thought BEFORE SUNRISE was great not as a reaction against that, but because it's so obvious Linklater and his actors give a hoot about human beings.  Yes, some of the dialogue -- which is very, very sharply observed -- is silly and pretentious; these are kids who want to impress each other, like each other, and enjoy 'deep thoughts.'  It reminded me so much of college: that thrill of ideas, possibilities, yearnings.
The movie looks beautiful and is terribly romantic.  Thank God Linklater is savvy enough to play out some conversations in long takes; a cumulative effect and rapport is built between Delpy and Hawke, their pinball game, and us.  They're both movie-star beautiful, but for a while, they're just regular folk.Kubrick and Hitchcock may be better directors than say, Linklater or Levinson, but their cold formalism does make one wonder what grudge they hold against people.  The Coens seem to be warming as well -- FARGO and THE BIG LEBOWSKI bespeak a new affection in their clever hearts.  But, for my money, give me a director who loves people -- a Sturges, a Lubitsch, and, yes, Linklater -- and their works will shine in a way that some geniuses' never do.",8,2,4,7 May 1999
The Sixth Sense," Mellow suspense film. Spoilers.
","I hadn't seen the trailer and don't care much for Bruce Willis, so it wasn't until this last weekend (and a slew of Oscar nominations) that I plunked down matinee money to see The Sixth Sense.  I knew there was some Big Secret Twist and the tag line ('I see dead people'), but that was all I knew.Without spoiling anything, I've got to say that pretty soon into the movie I had figured out the twist, and I thought it was so obvious that I assumed there must be something more; halfway into the movie I realized, nope -- the writer director is saving this up for his big revelation.  That was a letdown.Dispensing with that, I thought this was a decent enough movie.  The character study made this probably the most mellow suspense movie I've ever seen, but that was fine.  The movie rightly lets its emphasis fall on the young boy who is far more interesting than his doctor, but this also leaves one of the holes large enough to drive a truck through: the disintegration of the doctor's marriage so quickly after being shot is presented as an incongruous 'given;' that was my immediate tip off that there was only one explanation.  The movie also plays a little coy with its supernatural rules ('they can only see what they want') so that the dead can move a physical object (a coin, videocassette box, a piece of jewelry) but then, maybe not (the desk barring the door).The main reasons I decided to see the movie were 1) check out Haley's performance and 2) there's just not much else out there right now.  All of the performances in the film are good, but Haley Joel Osmet and Toni Collette, as the boy's mother, have a couple of scenes together which are terrific.  Neither one gets to exhibit a great deal of range -- not their fault; it's written into their parts -- but they more than make due with what they're handed.  Osmet and Collette's final scene together in the car is absolutely fantastic, wrenching stuff.A side note: Osmet is in far too many scenes to be considered a supporting actor. Perhaps that's just my perception because I was quite interested in his character and predicament, but as I think back, he still seems to have about equal screen time with Willis.  I haven't noticed that anyone else picked up on this, though.",7,0,0,14 March 2000
Sin City," empty, empty, empty
","SIN CITY is an okay movie, but bothersome. It's just empty, vigilante nihilism, basically, except for Bruce Willis' character. It's a set-'em-up, knock-'em-down kind of movie -- establish protagonist, establish villain, establish heinous deed(s), kill villain heinously; next story. The three main stories which make the lion's share of the movie are also pretty similar, so it gets repetitive and feels too long. There are lots of acts of violence, but for the most part they're very cartoonish, so we can squirm happily and know that nothing's really at stake -- certainly not our notions of the world or anything.This is the part that bugs me: stuff like this and Kill Bill are these constructs, these exercises, just as much as something like Wimbledon or Summer Catch are. It doesn't bother me so much that we as an audience will go see a fluffy romantic comedy as it does that the better directors in the machine are now cranking out vengeance scenarios with witless but kind of inventive brutality, and that's our popcorn. I'm not thrilled with what that says.There's nothing there; it's not like the constructions of, say, the Coens or Kubrick, which you can argue are cold, but at least are recognizably informed by life and thought; this stuff is informed by movies, basically, so you get hallmarks of characters without any fleshing out which really lets you get lost in that world. There's not a lot to think about when it's over (except how empty it is). And I know the argument against wishing for more is 'it's just entertainment.' Well, okay: then that turns it back to us. What are we seeking out as entertainment? But, yeah -- I bought my ticket, so I contributed. I should have gone with my instinct.Yep -- it looks good, but that pleasure disappears pretty quickly. It's not Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow -- which was ridiculous in a whole other way -- but it suffers a similar effect: good technology just can't take the place of a gripping story. If this movie had been as cleverly plotted and populated as, say, Blood Simple, and we actually gave a damn about the characters except as action figures, it could've been a masterpiece; it had all the elements except for some bad acting here and there (Jessica Alba, and especially Michael Madsen, who is just awful).It's just sad.",5,24,48,2 April 2005
