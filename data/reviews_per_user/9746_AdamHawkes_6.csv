Later he listens to the record and he is surprised at his own eloquent voice. After that he trusts Lionel and starts the therapy. That is the way they make close friends.I like the characters of this film, especially Lionel. He is apparently rude but this is his way he communicates with patients. He relieves others' mind by talking frankly. I like such an attitude very much. If there are doctors who are like him, I also see them.This film is based on the real story of the relationship between King George VI and Lionel. I think it is brilliant and moving. After I watched this film, I really decided to cherish my close friends. The life that has the best friend must be wonderful. This film makes me think of that.",10,0,0,30 September 2013

Schindler's List," The film that should be watched
","During World War 2nd, Nazi was persecuting Hebrew. In such a situation, there was a man. Though he was German, he sheltered a lot of Hebrew by employing them as workers of his factory. He is Oskar Schindler. This film shows the story about him and what we must not forget forever.I have watched this film three times. When I did for the first time, I was an elementary school student. So then I couldn't understand anything about the film. But now I can and think it is worth watching so much, because it teaches us a lot of things that we should know. What Nazi did, of course, is very cruel and must not be repeated. We has to remember not only this but also people who did something merciful to help someone on the edge of death. They stand for justice, I think.The film has a lot of terrible scenes, so it is hard to see them. But they represent what happened in the real. Therefore I tried not to miss the portraits and remember them.Oskar Schindler is one of the people I really respect. If you don't know him, please watch this film.",Null,19,31,29 September 2013

However all he wanted to do is know what his father really is. The relationship of Will and Ed is getting worse but Ed's disease makes it changed.This story is fantastic, amusing and moving. The film has all of them so I had been excited while I was watching it. There are several stories and each of them is related to the others. Taking it into consideration, the stories are elaborate. It is one of the reasons why this film is interesting.I think that Ed doesn't make up his past. Though, of course, he doesn't talk the fact, he tries to tell his life to his son and everyone in his way. If only what someone says is big fish for the others, he only knows what it means. In fact we may be deaf ears to his story.",9,0,0,30 September 2013
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Brilliant Memories
","Joel has a quarrel with his girlfriend, Clementine. She, somehow, forgets her memories about Jim. So he tries to make up with her but he can't. He gets angry and he also deletes his recollections about the time when he has lived with her. While they are being wiped out, he regrets asking the hospital which is specialized in brain to make him oblivious. He struggle not to forget the memories in his consciousness.At first I can't understand this story because the time and places changes one after another. It is an elaborate work, which is due to the director and casts.This story is so unique that I am excited with it. If memories can be deleted in the real, I do not want to do so. Because past is becoming more and more brilliant as time goes by, I believe. Even if it was hard then to put up with what you had experienced, several years later it will be one of the great or important things.This film may give us a chance to reconsider the relationships with people who we love. We need to review our history to find something really important.",9,0,1,29 September 2013
Departures," Thinking of death is thinking of life
","Daigo works as a cellist of a orchestra in Tokyo. But suddenly it breaks up and he loses his job so he and his wife, Mika, goes back to his home. There he finds a help-wanted ad for 'travel agents'. He thinks it means travel agents as the name but it is, in fact, embalmers. That is to say, the travelers are 'bodies' that goes to the other world. Fortunately or unfortunately he starts to work as an embalmer but his friends and wife are against his job. He himself has a difficulty thinking which job he should takes, a cellist or an embalmer. He, finally, makes up his mind.I began to think over mortality after watching this film. Being dead and being alive are too abstract to understand. But they are the closest to us, I think. No one does not face them in life. Everyone has chance to die so it is very important if we regard it as terrible or as great. The answer depends on situations because the way human dies is different from one to one. However the job of embalmers is a great one and necessary. Embalmer is far from dirty work. Thank to them we can leave for the next world beautifully.Please watch this film and reconsider mortality and life of ourselves.",10,0,0,29 September 2013
