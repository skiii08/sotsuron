Casablanca," Amazing...absolutely amazing!
","Though it had taken me a number of years to finally see this movie I found it far surpassed any other movie I had ever seen, and no doubt ever will see. This film is one of the crowning achievements in Film Noir as well as Bogart's career. This will forever be my favorite movie of all time. Though my mother had watched this movie again and again I had never actually taken the time to sit down and watch it. If you've yet to see this movie and you're here, reading this comment, I strongly suggest you get it immediately, and I'm sure you'll find you share an similar opinion to mine. Oh, and I suggest you get the black and white version; the color version ruins it.",10,1,3,17 October 2006
