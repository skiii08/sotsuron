Despicable Me 2," Entertaining, funny movie that falls right into the middle ground
","Although I enjoyed the first Despicable Me, I can't recall any funny scenes aside from the old scientist having a slow scooter. I think the main scenes that I'll remember will be the I swear rendition by the minions and their general craziness. Also, the youngest adoptive daughter, Agnes, has an absolutely adorable voice and is in the same vein as Boo from Monsters Inc.The movie has some really colourful animation and a somewhat straight- forward plot. However, plot is constantly moving with the minions always providing their unique form of energy. Definitely recommend it as a fun movie.",7,0,0,6 December 2013
Insidious: Chapter 2," Not as fresh and suspenseful as the first
","I was a fan of the first insidious and it gave me some genuine scares with the Darth maul look alike, but they lost the creepiness effect by showing too much of him. I finally got around to this one and it didn't have nearly the same effect as the first one. This could be due to the fact that it used the same formula and many aspects have already become clich√©. In multiple instances, I could predict what was going to happen and when a cheap jump scare was going to occur. Also many of the creepy ghosts almost became funny based off of their attempt to be creepy. There also was the added forced comic relief by the duo, which seemed very out of place.",5,0,0,7 November 2015
A Star Is Born," Compelling acting and dynamic soundtrack
",This was a movie that had a lot of buzz throughout its run. The two leads deliver strong performances with Bradley cooper in particular showing his acting and vocal range. The big name supporting actors also give great performances. The soundtrack is impeccable with some standout numbers. The Arizona song may have displaced shallow as my favorite from the movie.,8,0,1,22 August 2019
Don Jon," Energetic, Fresh take on the 20-something relationship crowd
","There is no doubt that Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one of the most talented young actors in Hollywood. He has impressed me in his past roles in Brick and Inception. In this movie he portrays a twenty-something from New Jersey who grows as a person from an immature kid into a man. The movie started off very strong for the first 25-30 minutes, with Scarlett Johansson doing an admirable job as his New Jersey girlfriend. I particularly liked how the pervasiveness of sexuality in the media was shown. From the Hardy's commercial to various music videos and models on TV. The rest of Don Jon's family were also great, and I wish we could have spent more time at the dinner table with them. Julianne Moore played a much larger role than I had originally expected, and did a great job helping Jon grow as a person.I thought the sister character constantly being on her phone aside from one line seemed a bit out of place. That kind of character is more apt to pop up in a quirky comedy. Also clocking in at an hour and 23 minutes, it was fairly short. This is positive in that I think the movie was losing steam. The negative aspect is that we don't really get to see what happens with the Jon and his new love interest. However, I could understand why that was left open-ended since Jon's addiction to pornography was the focus rather than the actual girl he ends up with. One tiny part that showed Jon's growth was when he chooses to go to the basketball courts and change his routine from just weight training. I thought that was a nice subtle way of showing how he had grown as a person that wasn't only focused on his old ways.",7,4,5,20 December 2013
Midnight in Paris," Beautifully shot and transports you to a different time and place
",Anyone who has visited Paris and finds themselves feeling that they miss the city should definitely watch this movie. It manages to capture that palpable atmosphere of the city from the get go and then transports you right into the 1920s. The great artist of the era are effectively played by prominent actors with Dali and Hemingway standing out in particular. Marion cotillard is great playing the muse and captures the essence of a Parisian beauty with mystery and beauty. The Themes of longing for life in a different era is something that I personally fond myself relating to and the way in which the story resolves itself is very satisfying as you see the protagonist grow. Also as a North American I was able to relate to how Gil finds a certain magic to Paris or Europe that other people do not appreciate. The dialogue between the actors of the modern era isn't as snappy as you come to expect of woody Allen films but it further shows why Gil longs for a different time.,9,0,0,3 July 2016
Molly's Game," Chastain delivers a powerful performance with an excellent Sorkin script
","I caught this movie on TV and was immediately drawn in and felt that I needed to watch it from the beginning. I from the initial few minutes that I caught of the film, I immediately knew that the sharp dialogue and script, that this would be a captivating story. The script has typical Sorkin pacing, as each character delivers their lines. Chastain delivers a solid performance and after seeing interviews of the real molly bloom, it's clear to see that she studied the character she would play. The movie tends to spoon feed the viewer when her father becomes her therapist and states what was obvious to a keen watcher, but I could understand why the choice was made to be direct. Overall, the story and script with solid performances by the leads makes for a great movie.",7,4,7,30 October 2018
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain America cements its position as one of the best cinematic heroes
","The first Captain America movie set up a great backstory to Captain America, and the Avengers made the Captain even more likable. This movie shows just how cool the Captain can be. One of the standout points of this movie was the amazingly realistic fight scenes. During each fight, as a viewer, you could feel the impact of each punch and kick. Plus its interestingly realistic how the Captain literally runs from point A to point B, and also runs through each fight. One of the nitpicks of the movie was how with the Nick Fury story arc. There's a certain reoccurring pattern that you can observe in the Marvel movies, and it takes away some of the tension. Also, it really seemed that Black Widow was trying too hard to have quips.",9,0,1,10 August 2014
American Hustle," Great mix of comedy and excellent acting
","Watching this after 12 years a slave was an excellent choice since you can't help but be absorbed in this light-hearted movie filled with stars. Bale once again loses himself in the character as he is barely recognizable as the overweight, balding con-man. Amy Adams also delivers as his partner in crime, while wearing a wardrobe that would make Princess Giselle blush. Not having watched any of Jennifer Lawrence's award nominated performances in the past, I was worried that she might stick out like a sore thumb amongst the great actors. I was wrong, and she absolutely delivered at the same level as the rest of cast. Bradley Cooper also showed that he has some range, and had a great Louis CK impersonation. De niro, Renner, and Louis CK are all very good in their roles. The only thing weak about the movie is the plot and script, which wasn't as tight as could be. I felt that you are drawn to the strong performances, but there is no synergistic effect in terms of story. But after having read in the trivia section about how Russell encouraged improvisation by the actors, I could see why the movie feels like it does. Fortunately, he used that as a strength of the movie. I forgot to add that the movie has an amazing, almost Scorsese- esque soundtrack. Plus the camera work had some very cool shots where it would quickly move in on the actor's expressive face from a distance. As well, although Jennifer Lawerence was good, I still don't think that she deserved the Golden Globe. Lastly, the ice fishing story was great.",9,0,6,1 March 2014
Rush," Well-acted movie with solid acting by the leads
","I had never heard of the actual rivalry of Niki Lauda and James Hunt prior to having watched this movie. However, I now feel compelled to start watching Formula 1 racing or at least do some Wikipedia research. The cinematography and filming of the racing scenes was done in a very vibrant manner. The pistons firing, gears turning, and constantly changing camera angles made the scenes very captivating. Chris Hemsworth did a solid job as Hunt, but I think that Bruhl stole the show in his role as Lauda. The mannerisms and speaking style with the overbite made him the more enthralling character over Chris's Hunt. Olivia Wilde plays a minor role with a very convincing British accent in her limited screen time. This is an excellent movie for both racing fans, and non-racing fans alike.",8,2,2,16 January 2014
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Different take on a familiar story
","At this point, we've been through multiple reboots of the spiderman franchise, so any future movies need to change the typical formula. This movie fits the bill perfectly. I didn't know anything about the spiderverse and had only seen the previous spiderman movies and 90s animated series. The movie immerses you into the comic world through lively action and cool editing. Although many people claim it's the best comic movie yet, I still think it falls short in that category, but it is an entertaining film. One of the aspects that holds it back is that the other spiderman characters from the other spiderverse are more intriguing than Miles Morales, which makes you wish it focused on them more. However this could simply be due the target demographic being teens who could relate to Miles better.",7,0,2,22 March 2019
Salt," Underwhelming movie that delivers some thrills
","I finally watched the movie after seeing it being played on TV multiple times. Even seeing the trailers many years ago, it never struck me as a movie I must see. However, after hearing many people mention favourable things about the movie, I thought of giving it a chance. Angelina Jolie gives it a strong effort, but is ultimately limited by the necessary physicality of her role. It sort of takes you out of the moment when Jolie is fighting multiple Swat officers and other thugs. I understand that it is her role in the movie, but she doesn't strike you as someone who could beat up these men. I also thought that the law enforcement agencies were particularly inept in being able to apprehend Salt. Her dressing up as the Russian major was also too much of a stretch as something that wouldn't turn heads. Salt's husband also seemed to play a smaller role than I would have thought. There were many plot holes like how the police and CIA didn't immediately clue in on the fact that Salt used the spider venom dart and not an actual bullet.",4,0,3,16 February 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," Powerhouse performances by both Leto and McConaughey
","Admittedly, I didn't know anything about what the Dallas Buyers Club was prior to watching this movie. I did however know how HIV and AIDS were viewed in the 80s, and I think that this would be a very accurate representation of that. Most of the publicity has been given to the performance of McConaughey, but I think Leto has not received the public attention that it deserves in spite of the Golden Globe victory. Aside from physically losing a lot of weight, the accents and mannerisms are spot on for both actors. The movie effectively shows a very tumultuous time in the 80s, and how things once were. The bullriding scene at the end definitely has symbolic value, though I'm not exactly sure what it means aside from how Ron lived his life possibly.",9,2,2,26 January 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Great action, performances, atmosphere and story continues the X-men saga
","After X-men First Class, the X-men franchise was given a breath of fresh air. This movie continues the same level of of quality story telling and great characters. The beginning of the movie and future scenes felt very similar to the bleak future portrayed in Terminator, after judgement day. The streets are littered with bones, the skies are dark, and sentinel carrying ships are tracking down the X-men. The main cast members are all back, and once again McAvoy, Fassbender, their older counter-parts, and everyone else are totally in character. Although Jennifer Lawerence wasn't given much to work with in the first one, she definitely holds her own with some great talent. I feel that the last X-men had Fassbender steal the show, in this one, McAvoy steals the show with his portrayal of a broken Professor X. I also liked how the time travel technique was different from most other movies. Some really cool mutant powers were introduced, such as Blink with her portals and Quicksilver with his superspeed.SPOILERS BELOW (mini-criticism)The after-credits scene seemed very unpolished, and almost had video- game level graphics for the special effects. I'd prefer that directors simply withhold these kinds of teases, when clearly they don't have the time or resources for the correct effect. A similar problem existed for Thor 2, which had a very cartoonish after-credits scene that may be corrected in Guardians of Galaxy.",9,1,2,25 May 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Script, animation, music and heart make for a fantastic sequel
","When I watched the first How to Train Your Dragon, it was a pleasant surprise that blew me away. The expectations were high this time around, and the movie did not disappoint. The animation is top notch, with scenes that transport you to flying amongst the clouds. The excellent soundtrack is also back, with 'Where No One Goes' by Jonsi being a standout track. Fortunately it is used many times in the film. There are some emotional punches that I won't spoil. Also, I like how the film further uses characters that have been maimed. Something that you was a surprise Hiccup's peg leg in the first movie, and continues in this one. I definitely will be looking to the next part of this franchise that appeals to all age ranges.",10,2,5,21 November 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Beautifully shot in typical Wes Anderson fashion with stellar cast
","This movie contains most of the typical cast members from Wes Anderson movies and has the same quirky feel that his movies typically contain. The sets are very beautiful, and certain scenes have an almost animated aspect. The movie also has some very funny characters, with Ralph Fiennes absolutely stealing every scene he is on screen. The relative new-comer portraying Zero also does a great job with his many scenes opposite of Ralph Fiennes. The re-occurring poetry scenes were hilarious as well as the Prison scenes. My only minor gripe with the movie was that the flashbacks gave it an uneven pacing. It would have been more effective if it was just set in the past.",8,1,3,1 July 2014
Frozen," Amazing animation, heart-touching story, and catchy musical numbers
","One of my pet peeves with both live-action and animated movies is that they can never get snow right. This was the first time that I have been impressed by the animation effects of the snow, ice and everything else. It's nice to see that Disney can make a computer animated movie that rivals anything by the other major studios. I was originally a little put off that it would be a musical, but after having watched it, Let it Go has been stuck in my head. It's also interesting that they chose to go with a non-Disney resolution to the major problem. The characters are all lively and funny, with the setting portrayed beautifully. With one of the coldest winters in recent memory for Greater Toronto Area, it's nice to see a fantastic winter movie.",9,6,11,9 May 2014
The Lion King," Technically amazing with emotional impact
","It goes without saying that this movie had some big shoes to fill. The original is a classic that is the Disney movie of a generation. Although this isn't a frame by frame remake, it follows the original very closely. The CG effects are breath taking, and the animals are seamless. Despite the strengths of the film, there are some drawbacks. The emotions aren't as strong as the original, which could be due the advantage of being able to emote stronger with animation instead of the real life based animals. Also some of the action scenes and chase scenes are a lot more disturbing with real looking animals",8,0,1,15 March 2020
22 Jump Street," Follows the same formula as the original and it works
","Right from the first scene, the chemistry between Tatum and Hill is palpable. I wouldn't be surprised if many of their scenes contained a large amount of improvisation, based on how well they work together. The movie makes it no secret that the plan is to follow the same story as the first movie, since they make frequent mention to it in the set up of the plot. Aside from the two co-leads, Ice cube plays a much more prominent role and is great in his larger role. I feel that the movie is about 20 minutes too long, and drags towards the end. As well, some of the age jokes by the roommate across the hall and the bromance jokes do fall a little flat. Although not as good as the original, it is still very funny and is a great comedy.",8,4,11,26 July 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Uneven pacing and storytelling, that wastes some great performances
","The Amazing Spiderman never really found its stride, and this movie suffers from the same problem. This is really a shame, because Andrew Garfield really embodies the Spiderman character and Jaime Foxx tried with what he was given. Even though nobody would ever believe that Peter and Gwen are 18 year-olds, that isn't the main problem. The real issue stems from trying to jam too many characters into a single movie. Three villains were not really necessary, and movies can seldom handle 2 main villains (Excluding TDK). The volatile relationships of Peter Parker at this point have become too clich√©, and is a reoccurring plot point in every Spiderman movie. The action scenes standout.",5,3,8,6 August 2014
Event Horizon," Interesting concept, but has undeveloped characters
","I've heard this movie come up oftentimes when it comes to really good science fiction movies. I think that this movie would been more impressive if watched in the 90s, but you can see how this could have been a major source of inspiration for movies like Sunshine and other science-fiction movies. There are also a few scenes that are oddly and unintentionally comedic, such as with Cooper in space. Regardless, some of the establishing shots are very impressive as well as some of the special effects. The movie draws a lot of parallels to Sunshine, but this movie stays truer to a typical horror movie, so it is understandable that it isn't as strong of an overall movie.",5,1,2,10 August 2014
Prisoners," Intense drama-thriller with powerhouse performances by Jackman and Gyllenhaall
","This is a 2 and a half hour movie that takes the viewer on an intense viewing experience. Jackman shines in his role of a father who has had his daughter abducted. Gyllenhaall plays a more subdued hotshot detective, and also delivers a very strong performance. It would have been nice to find out more about his character since he doesn't fit the typical mould of a detective with the neck tattoos and tattoos on his fingers. However, that would have detracted the focus of the movie. The constantly rainy and overcast weather also gave it a very depressing atmosphere that worked well with the nature of the plot. Melissa Leo and Paul Dano both impressed in their supporting roles. The use of some camera shots was very memorable with the way the framing. The framing of Paul Dano's character's eye in the shower stands out in terms of framing. The only thing that prevents me from giving this movie a higher score was the script was not as powerful as the directing and acting. In retrospect, I can recall shots and scenes that stand out but not any specific lines.",9,1,2,21 December 2013
Elysium," Overrated movie, with a heavy-handed message and too many plot holes
","To start, I was a big fan of the originality of District 9 and thought that Elysium would be another cool original Sci Fi movie. After watching it, I couldn't help but think of the countless plot holes and nonsensical aspects. Off the top of my head: the robots are hit with radiation for no reason, Elysium doesn't have a defence system other than a person firing RPGs from Earth, the robocop guards of one of the richest men in the world have none of the cool weapons we see in the armory later. Also, the whole idea of providing medpods to masses doesn't solve problems of overpopulation and crime that still would plague Earth.The only reason I gave this movie a passing grade is the wonderful performance by Sharlto Copley. I would describe it as an almost psychotic T-1000. Absolutely loved his South African accent and slang (Boykie!).",5,1,2,1 December 2013
La La Land," Delivers a fantastical take on a classic story
","This film has a surreal, dream like feeling that persists throughout the movie from the opening dance number to the big number at the observatory and the big finish. Stone and Gosling carry this movie as the two main leads and both impress with their dancing and performances. Stone in particular shines, whereas Gosling is a more stoic and brooding figure. Although the ending caught me off guard, I think it makes more of an impact. The costumes, cinematography, and energy is top notch and it makes for a unique experience",8,5,6,8 March 2020
The Disaster Artist," Strong performance and movie worth weak ending
","Having watched and enjoyed the room for all its cringey glory, I was curious to see what the disaster artist had to offer. It seems that's James franco performances are normally hit or miss and this is definitely a hit. He truly carries the film along side his brother with James immersing himself in the character of Wiseau. I like how the movie focused on developing him as a character rather than just a caricature of himself. Admittedly, I doubt know much of the character that David Franco played, but his character seemed very flat and simply a spectator in the story. The only major gripe I had about the movie was that the ending was very corny and out of place. Knowing that the initial reaction to a film of this quality would be confusion and disappointment, it seemed out of place for all the audience to start laughing. It seemed like a very rushed and sudden ending that may be a sign of an inexperienced Franco directing.",7,0,0,21 July 2018
12 Years a Slave," Powerful film that is tough to watch, but needs to be seen
","This is truly a movie that I doubt anybody could watch more than once. The entire cast shines in this movie, with Fassbender delivering a bone- chilling performance as the cruel slavemaster. Although 2 hours and 15 minutes long, it feels much longer due to the bleak outlook of the main character. Every member of the cast delivers a stellar performance in this cast, with particular mention to Paul Dano who has shown once again how far he has come from the Girl Next Door days. I also appreciated that they added the character of Benedict Cumberbatch to show that there were certain people at that time that were not completely against slavery nor cruel as Fassbender's or Giamatti's character. It was important to show that these kind of people existed at the time, and acted as enablers of slavery, without actually demonizing them. Steve McQueen, also does a great job using the cast and creating some great shots with excellent cinematography. One of the shots that stands out is after Solomon has been kidnapped and how the camera simply focuses the dark, deep whirring of the propeller of the steamboat. I found it almost similar to how a certain, sometimes mundane detail is focused upon in terrible nightmares. One minor nitpick would be the presence of Brad Pitt. In spite of his important role as producer, I feel that another actor should have been given his role. It seems way too perfect to give the A-list star the role of the only moral character in the whole movie.",9,3,6,1 March 2014
Joker," Phoenix delivers a powerhouse performance
","Considering that previous joker films have been great to excellent, this movie had big shoes to fill. There's a certain level of anxiety and awkwardness with this movie, which is what is needed. You can see Phoenix's character almost hitting his breaking point in multiple occasions and when he finally does, it is enthralling",8,2,2,20 March 2020
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Great action movie with fast paced action throughout, but weak ending
","The movie starts off by re-introducing John McClane, and immediately takes off with non-stop action. Samuel L Jackson has great chemistry with Willis, and they really work with each other. Even thought the movie was made almost 20 years ago, due to the dependence on mainly practical effects, it still looks good. The one major downfall of the movie was the ending. It is too bad, since that is what the viewer will remember. It could have been easily re- mediated if they went with a less typical Hollywood-type ending, and that would also have been in line with everything else in the movie. Also, the water riddle was solved way too easily by John, and the editing of it didn't even show how he randomly arrived at the answer.",8,4,4,10 August 2014
The Conjuring," Genuinely scary movie that doesn't rely on cheap scares
","I find that horror movies are mostly not effective at scaring me. This was very different than traditional horrors that rely on either gore and blood or jump scares. This movie moreso relied on atmosphere and the creepy setting. Since most of the movie takes place in one house, the director uses many interesting shots and camera movements to keep the setting engaging. The actors all portray their characters effectively, with only Livingston looking out of place. This may be due to me only seeing him as his Office Space character forever. As with most horrors, I feel that the ending is a bit weak since we actually see the main villain directly. Regardless, this is an excellent horror movie that is better than another recent horror movie, Sinister, by not having the cheap jumpscares. Minor nitpicks would be that the doll never really scared me, and the beginning seems comedic and out of place with everything else. Also why have a museum of evil in a house with a young daughter?",8,0,0,13 April 2014
The Croods," Surprisingly a funny and visually beautiful adventure
","I didn't expect much going into this movie. I feel that it was sort of overshadowed by the large summer blockbuster releases. I vaguely remember the trailer advertising it as a cave man family vacation. It was however more than that. It sort of went under the radar, and I think that works to its advantage. Some of the scenes of the forest were very reminiscent of Avatar, with bright colours and interesting creatures. Although the ending and end credits song were very upbeat and happy. (End credit song is very catchy in the way that Tarzan songs were catchy). There was one dark moment that truly stands out, when Grug is left by himself in the cave and paints his family in a circle of his outstretched arms. If this was a dark and macabre film, they could have ended Grug's story at that point and faced the ire of angry parents and fans. However, I do prefer the happier route that the director chose. As well, the action scenes were actually very exciting and intense. You really can't go wrong with Nicholas Cage as your lead voice actor, and his characteristic talking style adds to the story. Overall, give this movie a shot and sit back and just take it all in.",8,0,0,22 November 2013
The Greatest Showman," Spectacle and great music
","On the suggestion of watching this movie due to its strong soundtrack, I thought of giving it a chance. The cast is strong with Hughe Jackman doing most of the major lifting as the main protagonist. I liked Michelle williams character, but feel she was underused. I also felt jackman's motivations seemed forced. However the main draw of the film was the costumes and song and choreography, on which this movie delivered.",7,0,0,8 April 2019
The Purge," So bad, that it prompted me to write this review
","When I first saw this trailer, I was intrigued about this idea. However, after seeing how they executed it, it leaves a lot to be desired. The main issue with this movie was how both children were so poorly developed. The fact that the son just randomly let in a stranger without any plan afterward made no sense. Plus the kids would randomly just storm off after giving their father a hard time regarding what he was planning to do. This is definitely one of those movies where you scream at the screen. They could have developed the motives for the children's strong opinions, rather than them just staring at their father in disgust.",2,1,2,27 September 2013
Godzilla," Destructive action with monsters that have weight
","Godzilla is clearly the main character of this movie, which is a welcome change from 1990s Godzilla version. Although you don't see much of Godzilla, there is a big payoff with the climax. The movie had a much darker atmosphere that was reminiscent of War of the Worlds with a lot of ash and grey skies. The Halo jump scene had a gritty sense of realism that was one of the standout scenes. I also liked how the movie didn't mimic King Kong in one of the major scenes, when it could have easily done so. Rather it handled that scene in a much more enjoyable manner. A minor criticism of this movie was that the rest of the acting was not up to par of Cranston. Other parts of it, like the train scene, felt very reminiscent of Battle LA.",8,6,11,17 May 2014
What We Do in the Shadows," Ridiculous, hilarious, and full of heart.
","I heard about this movie on Reddit, and after looking at the trailer, it looked promising. However the actual endearing quality of the characters only truly cones across in the movie. The three main vampires are truly the heart and soul of this movie. Each one has a very unique personality and there are some instant classic quotes such as the werewolves and not swearwolves scene and the spaghetti scene. The lead vampire does an amazing job as the lead and you can't forget about stu. Parts of it very dark comedy and the excessive gore causes a mix of disgust and comedy. It is a truly unique movie that may be polarizing but if quirky comedy is your thing, then you'll love it.",9,1,3,7 November 2015
The Hangover Part III," Some laughs, hopefully they let the series rest for now
","The same cast is back for more shenanigans, but without the same effect. Alan has become a caricature of himself, and it really seems like they're making more movies just for the sake of it. The laughs are few and far between, and the movie simply doesn't have the energy of the first part. The post-credits scene just seems thrown in to leave a possibility of a sequel, and was not necessary. John Goodman's character could have added a lot more to the story, as we've seen him in other comedies. Leslie Chow also has the same problem of Alan, with having become a caricature of himself. I would recommend this movie to fans of the hangover since it has the same cast, but not the same comedic value.",6,0,1,29 September 2013
Annihilation," Beautiful movie that lacks an effective ending
","As a fan of Alex garland's past work like ex machina, I was immediately interested in this movie upon hearing that he was involved. Natalie portman portrays the role of a professor who is trying to cope with a recent tragedy well, and the rest of the supporting cast also does a good job in their roles. With recent movies like Ghostbusters trying to go with all female main cast members and not achieving success, this movie shows that it can be done. I had not even noticed it was an all female cast until somebody else pointed it out to me after having already watched the movie. I think that's a sign of good casting and the actors are perfectly chosen for their roles. The shimmer is truly beautiful as creates a vibrant world. I wish more time could have been given to exploring the worldand characters. The movie also has some very creepy scenes and a haunting score that reminds me of under the skin. Ultimately the ending of the movie is the main issue. I understand that it was meant to be open to interpretation, but this wound up being very confusing and seemed to be more of a demonstration of cool visuals rather than actually bringing closure to the story.",6,0,2,10 September 2018
Incredibles 2," Action, comedy and excellent animation
","Being a big fan of the first movie, I was excited to see if this movie could meet the high bar initially established. Although it didn't have the originality of the original, it was a bet fun movie. It's apparent that the animation technology has drastically improved, and the movie once again shines when all the superheroes team up to use their powers together. I understand that this movie has elastigirl as the central character, but she's not as engaging of a main character on her own. Maybe next movie could feature the entire family a bit more.",9,2,2,21 January 2019
Her," Interesting concept for a movie, driven by strong performances
","With people being increasingly connected to technology, this movie deals with a future where it is possible to have an OS as a significant other. I also liked how the movie showed a future that wasn't that foreign to us, with just minor changes in fashion and city infrastructure. Phoenix's acting is what truly carries this movie, as he portrays a person who is damaged from his past relationship and is a tentative with starting a relationship with the OS. He does an excellent job of showing how he grows throughout the movie. Scarlett does a great job of using her unique voice as the voice of the OS. Amy Adams is always a welcome addition to any cast, and does well in her supporting role. I feel that the movie slightly lost momentum after attempt with the surrogate, which was cringe-worthy. As it should have been. I think that the change of pace may have intentional since it coincides with the events of the movie.",8,0,1,9 May 2014
