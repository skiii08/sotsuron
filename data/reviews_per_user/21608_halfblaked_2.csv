The Ring," Grow up people... The Ring is awesome and you know it
","Ok, first of all, The ring is by far the best horror movie in the past 20 years.  There is absolutely no arguing that.  The direction is great, (it mirrors Kubrick's direction of The Shining), the acting is awesome, and is wonderfully crafted into a climax that is one of the most memorable moments on film.  I haven't seen the original, however I do feel that all the people complaining, and criticizing it because of the fact that it is a remake should grow up, and realize that new movies can be commended. The Ring shows a type of horror few movies can pull off... Psychological terror.  This movie should make tons at the box office, because of word of mouth alone,  despite all the mediocre reviews its getting from the critics... only because its a remake.  I wish people could realize the brilliance of this movie.  I also wish people who feel important criticizing a movie could grow up and admit they were scared. Yeah you heard me.SEE THE RING!",10,0,0,19 October 2002
Spider-Man," Are you serious?
","Being a big spiderman fan, i was expecting one of the greatest super hero movies ever.  Boy was i dissapointed.  I can honestly say that this was the most dissapointing movie of all time.  First of all, during the movie, i kept telling myself that this was a 'comic book' movie, and that the dialouge would be pretty bad.  I just kept telling myself that, and I can only tolerate so much.  But oh my god, there are so many dumb lines, I can't even explain.  Most of them are cliched, which doesnt bother me too much.... its a comic book movie.  But its amazing how many stupid things that were squeezed into the script.  My other complaint was the wrestling thing... with his costume.  If he had just appeared with his sleek, tight, spider man costume than that would of been cool... but instead they stress that he cant do that and make him wear that stupid nike clothes, and like a freeking ski mask.  Then all of a sudden it shows him wearing his new costume... Please someone tell me how he made it?  iF you know please email me... Someone explain the hundreds of other ridiculous things that happened in this movie... please, I just dont get it.  I know this a franchise, money making movie, whatever... but why after the entire movie of peter whining how much he loves MJ, does he just say 'i cant?'  Man that is a complete waste of the movie... it defeats the entire purpose... there is absolutely no closure... god why was the movie so bad?-the very best part is when he jumps on the car... and at the very end when he's swinging around. And oh yeah, there is 2 fight scenes IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE.  Both of which were not even choreographed well.  At best this movie gets a 6/10, only because of that car scene.",1,5,13,4 May 2002
