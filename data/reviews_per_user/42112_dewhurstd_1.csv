The Sound of Music," This is an excellent movie
","This is an excellent movie and a must see for all you old movie fans. After watching this movie for the first time in many, many years and I loved it all over again. Just watching it with my family made it all seem very real. I really liked the time when the children and Maria are in the meadow and Maria teaches all seven children how to sing, using one of the classic songs Do-Rae-me-fa-so-la-tee. I also like the concert at the end before they hide in the Abby. I recommend this movie to all people especially old movie lovers. This is an extremely great over all for movie for the whole family to enjoy, and a must see. This movie will live on for many, many years to come.",10,2,8,29 June 2006
