Casablanca," great movie
","I grew up in yorkville area of manhatten, n.y. and was just 8 years old when I and about five hundred other kids from the neighborhood saw casablanca. when rick tells conrad veith that he 'doesnt advise the Germans to invade certain sections of new york' our theater always exploded in patriotic fevor. We felt we could beat any invader that had the nerve to cross the east river and come into our neighborhood. thats the way we felt about our country at that time, I am 65 years old and I must have seen casablanca at least 20 to 30 times and I still get that same feeling I got back then. I consider this movie a national treasure and a work of art that could only have been made in the good old U.S of A. it will live on forever.",10,2,3,2 January 2005
