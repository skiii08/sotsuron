The Ring," A very Scary Film
","Spoiler Alert 'The Ring' WOW!!! what a scary film!!!! This Film was marvlous it was the best film I have ever seen!! My favourite part had to be when the lady watched the video and she had to find out all about it!!!!! It was scary when you saw the little girl who was murdered. Also when they put in flash backs of the victims of the murder by the tape, who had blood and all sorts of nasty things on their faces.  But the Scariest part had to be when at the end when the girl came out of the TV when the man was watching the video!!!!!! I would give this film a 10/10 for a Good, scary, exciting and terrifying video!!!",9,1,1,13 September 2003
