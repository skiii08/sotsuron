Scarface," This is how you do it large
","What a film! I have seen this film so many times I can flip into montanna mode at the drop of a hat. No other film comes close to this. Stylish, brutile, symbolic, revolutionary, a true master piece for every one involved. I dont think people actually relise how influential this film is. When I go to see a film, or any of my friends go to the movies, its always 'was it as good as scar face', always comparing the feeling i get when the last shot closes in the film. To finish, if you havent seen this film not only must you live under some rock in outer mongolia, but your missing one of, if not the finest films ever made.",Null,0,0,6 June 2001
The Usual Suspects," And like that.....hes gone!
","This is to all those people that rubbished this film.  You wouldn't know a good film if it jumped up and hit you with a left hook Dela Hoya would be proud of.This film is in my top five, and if you put titanic or any of those teen slashers in front of this, then damit this film wasn't made for you.  Get on with your life.In my opinion most films lick balls compared to this. If you haven't seen it stop reading and get out a get yourself a copy, you won't be disappointed, and if you are, you're a weirdo!",Null,0,1,2 September 2003
Heat," 249th, what the f*!k.
","I can not believe this film is ranked higher in the imdb top 250 films. This film should at least be in the top 5.  How can films like 'fight club', 'singing in the rain', 'some like it hot' be ranked higher than Heat, not to mention a host of others.  It's a total travisty, and it also shows that people wouldn't know a classic film if jumped up a pointed a M-16 in thier face.",Null,1,2,10 July 2003
