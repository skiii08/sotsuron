United 93," See it, that's all, just see it
","The best film I've seen in years. For some weird reason, great new films that are smart, brainy, disturbing and/or controversial are talked to death while few people actually go see them. Especially if it's something to do with world events or history. See how small the numbers were for 'The Right Stuff' or 'Glory' or 'The Crucible' or 'Good Night, Good Luck.' 'Shindler' and 'Brokeback' made money due to ENORMOUS positive press and outrageous blessings from critics. 'nuf said. Just see this new film It's not 'too soon' and no, you're not too fragile to 'handle it.' Most of you sat through 2 hours (many did it twice or more) of Christ getting beaten savagely to death... comparatively, this is a piece of cake.",10,1,3,19 May 2006
