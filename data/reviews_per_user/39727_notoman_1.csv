Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A true classic
","What defines a classic? I say that a classic is a movie that stands the test of time... a movie that, as you watch it repeatedly, becomes appreciated more and more. I saw The Phantom Menace on opening night... at first, I was a bit disappointed. I am a big fan of the Star Wars movies, and I must say that I expected quite a bit more from Lucas. The plot, character generation, and script did not strike me as very intriguing or magical... the way I admired those of the first trilogy. However, the second and third time I saw the movie, I began to truly appreciate the movie. It really is a movie that is worth seeing more than once... there is so much more to appreciate and enjoy. The music seems to fit the scenes much better (the song Duel of the Fates is absolutely terrible to listen to by itself... but it fits the lightsaber battles quite well), and the characters begin to feel more 'alive.' Though many people think that The Phantom Menace really wasn't up to par for the Star Wars series, I think that it is a classic that will be enjoyed by generations of viewers.",10,0,0,5 June 1999
