Hereditary," Over Hyped And Falsely Marketed
","The thing is, I was REALLY looking forward to this movie. I was hooked from the first time I saw the trailer. The marketing and editing of the trailer was brilliant. It made me feel as though this was the next big thing in Horror movies. I felt hyped to see this movie! I even made jokes to my fiancee that I was going to be holding onto her, all during the movie and not to tell anyone if I ended up screaming or crying too loudly. I did not scream. I did not cry. I mostly laughed. Oh Zod, how I laughed out loud at this movie! That's when it clicked in my head that I had been suckered in by Hereditary...The problem with this movie, in my opinion, isn't that it's a bit slow in pace or tone; nor is it that the movie bait and switches the hell out of you---NO! The problem is that Hereditary believes its own hype; explains nothing and pats itself on the back for getting, to what equates to, a Participation Trophy! Listen, this movie isn't entirely bad or unwatchable---it has some great acting, scenes and ambiance---but it doesn't know what it wants to be. Honestly, it works better as a Drama, Suspense or Thriller but not as a half baked Horror film. Here are my thoughts on Hereditary; both good and bad:The Good:The acting in this film is very good (except for the dude who played the son) and believable. The mother gives very real reactions (mostly---she can over do it a bit) and you can feel her emotional exhaustion. The little girl who plays Charlie is very good in her role and I hope she continues to do other movies. She wasn't in the film for very long, but she did her best with what she had to work with. Most of the shots were used very well and added to the suspense. I even believe the director used a similar shot from The Shining in one scene. When Charlie dies, I felt horrible for the child. That was my emotional attachment to the movie. I was invested in the character and I was surprised when she was killed off, so early in the film. Regretfully, this is the end of the positive praises I have for Hereditary.The Bad:Oh Zod, where do I begin? I'll start with the obvious: THIS FILM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH GENETICS! Watching the trailer, you might believe that the film is about a little girl, possible mentally ill or with supernatural powers, due to her genetics (why else call the damn thing Hereditary?!), that is getting out of control or is in some kind of peril. Or something along those lines. What you REALLY get is a film that has ZERO to do with this child (who the film maker makes the focus of the trailer!), ZERO to do with genetics and all things hereditary and an ending so stupid, it gives Mother! a run for its money! The movie does address (very poorly and vaguely) that some mental illness does run in the family and that the mother has even (unintentionally) tried to kill her children but at the end of the day, it isn't needed or important because the Big Bad here is Zhuul or Satan or some Devil King (who, I swear to Zod, wears a cheap looking Jugghead Crown)!
I mean, imagine that for two hours, there's this guy who keeps talking about how he hates rice. This rice has done something to this poor guy, no doubt. Rice has to play into this story somehow! Then all of a sudden, the devil comes and kills him, puts on a stupid crown and leaves. The end. WHAT ABOUT THE DAMN RICE?! That's what this movie was. A bunch of talk and no good explanations. Speaking of which: Why? WHY?! That's all I could say after viewing this. Why did they make Little Charlie appear to be troubled, just to kill her off with no pay off? Why does the mom or any of the others in the family not know that Grandma is in a cult? Grandma was said to be this private woman but she literally leaves the mom nothing but Occult items! Why does the son cry like a cartoon baby? Why does the mom let a small teen go to a party with much older teens? Why does Charlie hide candy? Why does the dad go from being comforting to not having it overnight? Why was Charlie the grandma's favorite (assuming that she believed this was the Devil King) and not the actual MALE child? It's like she bent over backwards for this Devil King dude! In the end, there's just more questions; questions that lead to more questions and questions I never thought I'd ask. The bottom line to me is that people are going to walk out of the film thinking that the mentally ill are evil and are satanists and all that type of Stigma. I know it's true because I heard it myself! They used mental illness as the scapegoat for a cult movie. That's all Hereditary is: A movie about a grandma, who was a devil worshiper, who believed her deity was her granddaughter but wanted to be a boy, so somehow she kills her favorite grandchild so that her deity could then go inside her 2nd favorite one. Or something like that. It's STUPID!6 out of 10 for effort...",6,11,27,14 June 2018
Edward Scissorhands," Hardcore Fans Only
","Admittedly, I dislike Tim Burton. Sometimes, I really hate Tim Burton. I don't mean the director---I mean, the actual person. Tim Burton is just so, 'Ooh! Look At Me! I'm Different Than Everyone! No One Understands Me! I Was Bullied As A Kid!'. I feel like some of his 'torment' was self inflicted in a way. There's nothing special about Tim Burton's origin story. What makes Tim Burton special is the amount of pity he gave himself and the inflated ego it gave him. What's this assessment have to do with the movie, Edward Scissorhands? Well, it doesn't take a genius to know who the title character is based on...Edward Scissorhands is a dark and gothic fairy tale that makes little sense; has very unlikable or uninteresting characters and will only be liked by Tim Burton and every Emo kid that gets off to cutting to the image of Tim Burton. We start off with a grandma telling some kid about Edward Scissorhands. Edward lives in a dark, creepy castle, on a dark, creepy hill above a little, happy, light filled town. No one seems to notice this until a woman decides to sell makeup one day. Vincent Price plays his father (inventor) who dies before finishing him. That is to say, he gave him scissors for hands instead of regular hands. This is funny to me, since, in the movie, the inventor actually has a plan for this, and human like hands are on it, as like the 8th step. Okay, what the hell?! 'First, I shall put scissors for the hands! Then I will go get latex mold! Then I will make a pair of hands from said mold! Then I shall call my best friend Tim! Then I will watch Beetlejuice! Then I shall sharpen the boy's scissors! Then I will remove the scissors! Finally, I shall install the hands!'. WHY THE HELL WERE THE SCISSORS EVEN NEEDED?!! So then Edward goes to live with the makeup lady and her family. No one questions or is freaked out about this guy dressed in bondage with scissor hands. Well, they are and they aren't. They're not really concerned for the right reasons, I should say. They kinda just wanna know if the makeup lady is doing him. Edward can cut things like grass, shrubs and hair and that makes him valuable! No one has ever thought to do these things before! If it wasn't for Edward, people might have never cut their own grass or hair! Also, the daughter, who's known him for 5 minutes is now in love with him...for...reasons?! I mean, they haven't had any connected in any way; they haven't had a deep conversation; they know nothing of eachother but they're in love, I guess. Tim Burton does not know how life works. So now the boyfriend is mad and wants to kill Edward for getting his girlfriend all hot and bothered. The town people want Edward out of town now because they heard an unconfirmed rumor. Grass and hair be damned! So Edward runs home to his spooky castle, impales the evil jock boyfriend (admittedly, he did suck but he was also so unlikable and boring and miscast that you don't care) and never returns. Twist: Grandma was the daughter all along in horrible old person makeup!Tim Burton seems to think everyone who is not Tim Burton is the same. We're all bullies. We're all jocks. We're all mean. If you aren't pale, lonely or like the color black, you must be a bad, stupid or lesser person. If you don't live on a spooky mountain, in a spookier castle, well, guess what? You suck! You don't understand the pain of having pain! I like some of Tim Burton's work, like Big Fish and even the Batman films (though flawed). I like his movies where he leaves his ego and 10 year old self at home. Edward Scissorhands is a love story to himself, and for himself. Unless you're a hardcore fan of Tim Burton's work, you won't enjoy this film...",4,0,10,28 March 2019
Mother!," Tried Way Too Hard!
","I first heard about Mother!, while listening to two people talk about it on a radio podcast. They were talking about how shocking and controversial the movie was; mainly, the ending. I saw it in a Red Box one day, and figured my fiancee and I would give it a whirl. I wish I hadn't. I really, really wish I hadn't...The movie is riddled with biblical and religious overtones and themes. Each of the characters represents someone or even something in the bible. An example of this for instance, Mother is actually the Earth. You know? Like, Mother Earth? I bet the writer/director thought himself especially clever for that gem! I'm not religious---I'm an Atheist, in fact---but even I thought this fellow Atheist was too damn preachy! The movie is self indulgent and not needed. What's more: seeing people break a baby's neck and then eating it is not smart or artsy or anything. It's shock value. It's more on the lines of, 'Look At Me!'. I don't agree with religious aspects and such, but I also don't go out my way to impose my non-belief beliefs on people. This is what the movie is: The ultimate imposing of your right to believe in something. Someone's hatred disguised as art. To be fair, the sink was interesting. The sink was my favorite character...",1,0,3,14 December 2018
