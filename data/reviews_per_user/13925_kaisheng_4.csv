Howl's Moving Castle," Many Parallels with Spirited Away
","I just saw this movie yesterday and I haven't felt this way about an animated movie since 'Spirited Away' (albeit the latter left me much more in awe than the former, since it was the first of its kind).This movie had many of Hayao Miyazaki's other movies' trademarks. Lush landscape, endearing characters, haunting soundtrack (courtesy of Joe Hisaishi), great attention to details and all the little quirks, which brings a smile to one's (mine, at least) face.Its been a while after 'Spirited Away' was shown, and 'The Cat Returns' has been rather disappointing, so I was really looking forward to it. And I am glad to say that although I felt that there weren't any breakthroughs in 'Howl's Moving Castle' (HMC), it was on par with 'Spirited Away' (SA) and 'Princess Mononoke' and it was most certainly satisfying.Spoilers!!!! However, there seemed to be many parallels (coincidence??) between HMC and SA, which seemed kind of bizarre since SA was an original story while HMC was adapted from a book by Diana Wynn Jones (I most certainly will be paying my neigbourhood bookstore for it!).In HMC, Howl made a deal with Calcifer and it was up to Sophie to find out and help break the enchantment that held them both since they can't tell anyone what it is. On the other hand, Sophie herself was cursed to look like YuBaba (from SA) by the Witch of the Wastes and only Howl could help her, but she could not mention it to anyone else. In the process, she fell in love with Howl. What was revealed to us in the end was that Sophie actually witnessed the event where Howl and Calcifer met and signed the contract with each other, and told Howl to wait for her to help them break the enchantment.In HMC, there were also many interesting characters, most notable was the Scarecrow named Turnip and the dog (can't remember what its name is).In SA, Haku made a pact with YuBaba to become her disciple, in the process losing his true name and ended up being her henchman and doing all her dirty job. Chihiro stumbled into the enchanted world and had to become a servant in the land to save her parents through Haku's help. Haku helped her remember her real name. Along the way, Chihiro helped Haku remember his true name and he reveals to her that he once saved her when she was a child drowning in a river. They too fall in love.In SA, there was the child of YuBaba when he got turned into a fat rat (which has since spawned many soft toys) as well as the crows and the workers which helped Kamaji with the coal.Similarities aside, I enjoyed both movies. I've been a sucker for stuff like that since I was a child. I thoroughly enjoyed Neil Gaiman's 'Stardust', which I think Hayao Miyazaki would make a fine adaption as well.Furthermore, in HMC, Miyazaki explored the idea of war (the 2 countries of the world were involved in a war), making HMC a tad darker than SA, showing the destruction and mayhem brought about by the fighting.All in all, this movie is the best full-length animated feature I have since in 4 years (since SA). It definitely has more heart and soul than any of the Disney and Pixar features. Whilst it is true that 'The Incredibles' can dazzle one with the CGI and their American-centric wit while Shrek 2 entertained the masses with (by now dated) popular wisecracks, it is the eternal message of hope and love that will transcend time and technology, making HMC and SA timeless milestones.",9,9,13,27 February 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," Nothing more left to say
","Well, I just saw The Matrix Revolutions and I must say, the movie definitely overwhelmed me with the special effects. Nothing short of impressive.However, for the people who expect some more insights, or nuances and subtleties of what the Matrix is, there is none. This time, its just the fight to the last man for the city of Zion. Every man is fighting for freedom. It is a war waged on many fronts. Zion, Neo, the Matrix, Trinity, Morpheus, Niobe, they are all fighting in one way or another. It is indeed a dark time. As they say, everything that has a beginning has an end, I might say, everything that needed to be said, has been said. This is just one roller coaster ride to end it all. Some might say that instead of going out with a bang, Matrix ended with a thud.I say that looking at Matrix Revolutions in its on light, it fared pretty well. The purpose of the third installment just seeks to put an end to the story (although I wonder how long it will be laid to rest, the next Matrix movie may not be written by the Wachowski bros? Maybe Neil Gaiman?). Given the development of the story, it seems the only logical conclusion.",10,0,1,11 November 2003
Spider-Man," Fantastic Spidey Action!
","Went to the movie with high expectations and the movie gave me what I wanted and more! The unfolding of the plot was somewhat true to the comic although it was very much watered down. Yet, this is expected since the comic was multi-faceted and it would be unreasonable to expect the scriptwriters to include every single sub-plot and detail. The adaptation was just apt.
Getting Tobey Maguire to play the part of the unassuming dorky Peter Parker was a good choice. He was excellent in his acting. However, William Dafoe's talents were under-utilised. His great calibre in acting was not fully developed in the film since his facial expressions were not visible under the green goblin's mask. Yet, these two actors did a fantastic job! It was a pity that Kirsten Dunst with her talent played a somewhat minor role in the movie.The visuals were eye candy with swift spidey swinging action! (And not to mention occasional TARZAN style screamin'.)It was great fun!The humour was good, and there was progress in character and relational development.A must see, especially for Marvel Comic fans.",8,0,0,1 May 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," The Matrix is Perfect in its Imperfection
","Matrix Reloaded is as fantastic as the first. If not even more so, if I might add. The sequel was just mindblowing and I am not talking about the special effects.Watching the movie the first time, I felt overwhelmed by the special effects and wasn't able to enjoy the subtleties of the movie. It seemed like too much emphasis had been placed on the effects (although I am sure many people flock to watch Matrix Reloaded for it). I came out of the movie rating it 6.5/10. 'What a letdown,' I thought. I was disappointed. This wasn't the movie I waited for 4 years to see! Sure, I enjoyed the highway chase scene (that will go down in history to be the greatest chase scene, bar none), who didn't? But I expected more from the Wachowski Brothers.It was when I was watching it the second time around that I realised how mindblowing the plot was, or should I say how ingenious the construct of the Matrix was! The irony of it all is that the Matrix is perfect in its imperfection. And many things said in the beginning of the movie will come back to haunt us towards the end. This movie needs to be watched at least twice for one to be able to grasp the full implications of whatever the characters did and the consequences that result.Here's to Matrix Revolutions in November! See you guys then!",8,0,0,19 May 2003
