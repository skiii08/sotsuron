Captain Phillips," As usual for Tom Hanks
","Very interesting film/story. Despite the fact that there are quite a lot of such films with hostages, but it does not negate the fact that each of them can be watched with pleasure if it is done well, if the actors played well. And this film is exactly like that. I really liked the rather emotional ending, I did not even expect that it would affect me that way.",9,1,2,19 October 2018
It," 'One time shot'
","Interesting story that prove genre horror, but totally absurd behavior of the characters. There is a difference between simple trying to make some little foolish for the maintenance of the plot, and banal stupidity of behavior like 'That kid cut me with a knife but we will not go to police - we will buy some tablets and bandages'.",7,0,0,2 January 2018
Captain Marvel," That Cat is the main 'star' of the film.
","Marvel films are an entertainment show. They never claimed any deep and elegant art of cinema. Their essence is a simple interesting plot, some jokes and sarcasm, heroes and superpowers, and of course, many spectacular and beautiful scenes. And before that moment it always worked. This was its value as a fun movie that can give you some 'cinematic pleasure' ...However, in this film, everything went wrong. I will not talk about the fact that it was many... no, a lot of 'cinema missteps'. I will talk about thing that gave main value to Marvel movies and here are dead: In this film we don't know at all what this war is for and why it is being fought, shameless and rude behavior of the main heroine, which the entire film served under the sauce of smiles and chuckles. Super intelligence of world where it's soldiers have to be act without emotion behaves like average emotional person from Earth. Nick the whole movie exposes like some idiot and clown. The main characters who have just met behave as if they have known each other for 20-30 years. All that humor, behavior and attitude is felt as if the film was made crumpled and in a hurry somewhere. Like all things that were in that film were just in one same day!
I am disappointed in this film. Marvel broke borders in theatricality.",7,2,2,9 June 2019
Passengers," Day after day...
","Not a bad and interesting story, adequate graphics, but what for me personally was the most enjoyable in this film, so it's to observe the design of everyday life. I really liked how different interfaces work, service robots and other stuff.",8,1,2,25 September 2018
Us," Not a good implementation of a pretty good idea.
","The idea of the film is quite interesting, but the whole film seems to be somehow broken. Such a feeling, that they didn't particularly think about how to implement this idea, but simply wrote such a scenario, which first came to mind. The only interesting part of the film, albeit partly it was expected, is the last 10 minutes.",6,0,0,28 May 2019
The Secret in Their Eyes," Beautiful representative of the drama genre.
","Despite the fact that I'm not really a fan of this kind of films, but I consider this very worthy. Especially impressed and liked the end.",9,0,0,3 October 2018
Creed," Successful attempt to extend the story
","In this film, I saw all the patterns that are inherent in boxing / fighting movies. But they are all intertwined well and in the end create a good continuation of what seems to be a complete story, but with a different thread. Particularly pleased with the unconventional film finale.
In general, if you did not watch Rocky, there is no tight binding, you can watch this movie separately.",8,2,3,27 January 2019
Aquaman," Is it really DC film?
","Marvel films for me have always been bright, colorful and funny. While the films of DC were dark, serious, to some extent brutal atmosphere. That is how I divided these 'universes'. Up to this time. Aquaman is interesting, BUT! very colorful, romantic comedy with fireworks at the end. Was it really a DC movie?",7,0,1,22 April 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Barely squeezed
","The farther from the first parts, the more mediocre the plot, behavior and logic of the characters. The last part is a carousel of all kinds of fireworks, jumps, and pathos in poses and words, and other movie clinches that already . Yes, it was very beautiful visually, but no, it was very often stupid in behavior of the characters and storytelling.
Many times in this film I caught myself thinking that certain things happen excessively fast, chaotically. I will not say that the film was bad, but I will say that I am sincerely glad that this story is finally finished.",7,5,12,30 March 2020
Bohemian Rhapsody," Truly Rhapsody.
","I would not call this film any kind of heartbreaking, with a deep meaning or an 'epic picture', but this is really a kind of very strong film. Such as biographical films about some strong persons can be. Formation, development and problems of their band are shown here well... including their leader of course. Freddy was an epic person, no matter how he was treated ... and whatever his sexual orientation.",9,1,2,5 November 2019
Bird Box," 'The Happening' from other side.
","Generally, this film does not show anything new. If in the past I hadn't watched 'The Happening', it would have been possible to put a slightly higher rating. But, their sitting in the house and rafting on the river had somehow boring. The idea of entities promised to be interesting, and even if the film is unanswered at the end, it is sometimes more correct than to write just something at the end, but with so little information about the entities makes this idea boring for the viewer.
Average movie to watch at once and forget.",7,0,2,21 March 2019
Armageddon," Movie for every taste.
","My favorite movie, as it is a comedy, a tragedy, and fantastic. That film is filled with emotions, good suitable music throughout that movie. By the way, it was my favorite music composer too - Hans Zimmer. I advise this film especially those, who like good 'old school' cinema. But it, as well, will appeal to those, who grew/grows in new time after 2000-th. I revised this film four times on TV, as a child, three times on computer with friends, and girlfriend. I'm sure, that it will not be the last time I will have a desire to see this amazing film. Alone, or with someone. I also recommend, if you have a good monitor/PC, you must download this film in the best quality you could find.",10,0,2,20 April 2014
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Fresh but not without 'Hollywood foolish mistakes'.
","The first half of the animation looks impressively interesting and fresh. And there I was infuriated by only one obvious stereotyped moment (taking an important object in a dangerous situation), it was just overly trite and stupid even to maintain the plot. But it was nothing compared to very positive emotions ... right down to the middle of that cartoon... Then everything went downhill template stupidities. It seems that until the middle was the creation of the creator, and after half the creation of stupid market heads. scenes - bright fireworks, long snotty dialogues, obvious dramas. Tipping points. By itself, in the right situations, all this is interesting, but thrown into one pile - 'bad taste' and 'circus'.
As a result, it was, in general, interesting, for which rating is 8, but no more.",8,0,1,18 March 2019
Apocalypse Now," Deep and dense atmosphere
","A great play of actors and camera angles, great music and sounds in precisely selected places. And of course the plot. That story and style of storytelling... very high quality work at a high level. This film deserves its rating.",9,0,0,24 October 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Interesting ending with extended snots
","An interesting film and quite successful conclusion to the story with all the main and third-party hero lines involved to this point. But there are two minuses: soooooo boring and unnecessary stretching of dialogues and meaningful looks at each other which stretch the film even more... and a completely artificial looking drama where they tried to show it, especially with inappropriate jokes that are considered normal for Marvel's films in another situation, but at this drama they spoil it additionally.
However, this does not spoil the overall impression of the film, which I was pleased with.",9,9,17,16 August 2019
Climax," Trash
","A grotesque, tasteless attempt to expose a trash work for something like 'a movie is not for everyone'. This addictive nonsense is not able to reach even the minimum level of illustration of any problem. They twitch the whole movie (dances?), they moan something about 'something is wrong' and 'build sideways looks' to each other. That's all... Oh, yes, some naked boobs. And some words about gays.",1,6,13,16 March 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," First part was great
","If not the immortal stupidity of the actions/heroes in films, it would be a great movie(thinking out loud: just a couple of seconds it was necessary to wait, you idiot). And sometimes I felt like relevant in the previous films jokes, here often inserted just to fill the airtime. In all other respects - an excellent film.",9,1,5,4 August 2018
Get Out," There is no limit to a human abominations
","At first, the film was a bit boring, but over time, in its own way, intrigue gained momentum and captured the attention with its main idea. How much people can be disgusting, and it was interesting to see in this film how sophisticated there are their ideas and opinions regarding their importance and disregard for others.",8,0,3,31 October 2018
Aladdin," This film in itself is relatively normal. But no more than that.
","The first half of the film looks like a very bad attempt to imitate the original Aladdin, with very flat and dumb jokes and very strange songs. Because what sounded in the film, my language will not turn to be called songs. There is such a thing that many creators do not want to understand: what looks beautiful and interesting, and appropriate in the drawn form in cartoons, will look wretched and 'wooden' in the performance of live actors.
However, the second half of the film already looked normal. Not good, but just fine. Having corrected the idiocy of the first half, it still did not stretch himself out so much that one could say that he was not ashamed of having pulled that original story from the past.",7,0,2,5 September 2019
The Lion King," Unforgivable and unfairly low rating.
","When I saw the rating, I expected to see a typical adaptation of an excellent story with disgusting or mediocre drawing or the introduction of the author's vision of this adaptation. But I was incredibly surprised that this work was very interesting and on very high quality done. It almost completely repeats the original story with a slight correction for the 'realism of the film' VS the 'animation capabilities of the picture'. And Those who justify their low rating by saying that in this film 'there is no such soul' and so on, just forget about that last thing.
Ignore rating, try to watch yourself.",8,3,7,13 December 2019
