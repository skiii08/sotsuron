The Avengers," very good movie cant wait for second installment
","i thought this was a very good movie but it would of been a lot better if they had the original hulk inside the movie, i didn't think the new hulk does any justice, looks abit fake to be honest plus edward nortan is a much better actor. the effects for the old hulk was also better, other then that the story line was great and it was good to see all those characters in 1 movie, cant wait for the second movie, it should be even better then the first, hopefully some new characters will be introduced into the movie, if you are a marvel fan you will not be disappointed. i got a feeling the next installment of the movie will have something to do with red skull as i don't think he was killed but only sent to the future. overall very good movie i rate it at least 7 out of 10",7,2,6,16 October 2012
