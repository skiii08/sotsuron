It," Made me miss the original
","For transparency sake let me say that the Original 'It' was one of my favorite movies as a kid. It was my first scary movie ever at the age of 12 and I must have watched it at least 5 times. I was so excited for this new reboot but ended up being so disappointed. It in no way does the original (or the book, which I've also read multiple times) justice. The clown is not scary at all. The jump scares are boring and I found myself waiting for it to end. The children have no characterization or personality beyond Bill. The chemistry between Ben and Bev which was so clear in the book was missing here and it honestly just made me miss the original. Frankly boring film.",5,0,1,26 October 2019
