Marie Antoinette," Marie-Antoinette or a big fuss for not much
","Dear all, I just finished watching Marie-Antoinette... well, where should I start? It was long, dull, very peasant actually. Even if I do understand and agree with Sofia Coppola point of view about Marie-Antoinette's temper and character, the whole film is long very long except when you start awakening helped by the music. You can even say that about some of the cast, they seem very out of place and bored. About Kirsten Dunst, she's perfect for the part as a naive and immature princess that suddenly became queen of France. She's very dull making the film last forever. Well, hopefully you had more fun than I have... Wish you so... It's such a big fuss for not much. MiarkaTo cheer you up, I recommend you watch Lost In Translation... Way better without the historic costumes",4,27,58,25 May 2006
