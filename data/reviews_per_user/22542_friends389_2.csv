Mission: Impossible III," Brilliant
","The best film I have seen this year. It was absolutely brilliant. It was the best film out of the three and the effects and the stunts were brilliant. My favourite scene was in film was the Vatican scene, the ways that they did some stunts and the different ways of doing spy tactics were good. There was his old team mate who is in every film and the new team mates were very good but I think that Johnathon Rhys Meyers could have done a Amercian accent instead of a Irish accent. The ending was very good with the twist at the end of the film with the girl in the maskOverall it was the best film of the year and Crusie has done another good job",10,0,1,9 November 2006
Hot Fuzz," Not so Funny
","Hot Fuzz is one of the best British films ever made, but it wasn't that funny. I saw it a couple of days ago not really expecting what to see. I sat down and the film began, the start was not funny there was no crying with laughter in the film. Then the film progressed and I started to laugh and laugh till I was in tears. But the humour wasn't proper British humour it was all a bit Americanised which was slightly annoying.But overall a very good British film, and Nick Frost was the best actor in the film because he has a natural talent to be funny. And also I can't wait until SimonPegg's new film Run, Fatboy, Run comes out.",9,1,4,28 February 2007
