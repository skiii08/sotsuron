The Lobster," Best part was at the beginning
","The best part of the movie happens within the first ten seconds when a donkey is shot, and that was the only time I felt any emotion. It doesn't get much worse than this. I know the acting is meant to be robotic but that comes off just like you would expect it to. What's the point of A list actors and then have them act poorly on purpose? The subject matter might be somewhat provocative but it doesn't carry the entire movie. I can really imagine people walked out of this. This movie is horrible and boring and I think these good reviews have to be made up. Please I'm trying to save you from wanting to do what happened to the donkey. Stay away.",3,45,79,19 December 2015
