Mission: Impossible III," slightly better than a total waste of time
","Very disappointing. The action scenes (90% of the movie) were so exaggerated that I couldn't suspend enough disbelieve to enjoy them.As in previous MI films, I left the theater trying to figure out the plot. The people you thought were bad guys all the way through the film are suddenly good guys at the end without clear explanation. And the major plot element (the rabbit's foot) was never explained.It looked like when they got into post-production they realized they had only bad takes of some vital scenes, so they just left them out! I wish I'd stayed home and read a book.That said, I enjoyed this film for more moments than either MI 1 or MI 2. Tom Cruise's character was more human and realistic (except for the impossible stunts) than in the first two films.",3,0,0,19 May 2006
