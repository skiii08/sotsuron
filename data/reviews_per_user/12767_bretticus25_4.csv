Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Disappointed, but understanding...
","I expected a LOT more out of this movie, and I think that Lucas had better get something going with this, or the next one might not be as profitable. It was more of a kid's movie, and the creature with the floppy ears that stayed with the Jedi throughout the movie was annoying more than anything. The plot tying in the trilogy lasted about 5 minutes in all, and I expected more of this. If you haven't seen this movie, and expect it to be like Star Wars, then you will be disappointed.  The drama just isn't there.  Too much uncalled-for humor that wasn't in the first film is in Phantom Menace.In a nutshell, it wasn't a waste of my time, was a decent film, with EXCELLENT effects, but thank God I wasn't caught standing in the long lines waiting for a ticket!",6,0,1,20 May 1999
The Butterfly Effect," Better IMHO than the ratings...
","I thought that this was a great movie.  I am into the weird genre, and this one really sparks the frontal lobe.  It is a trait of the deep thinkers in humanity to find those distinct crossroads of choices in our lives and contemplate them.  Contemplating alternate paths of our lives is very interesting to me.  This movie examines that concept, and does it well.  In the end, I was found realizing that the main character (Ashton) truly loved her (Smart) by the ultimate choice that he made. This is a great 'must-see' for you who enjoy the weird and strange.",9,0,1,8 February 2004
Vanilla Sky," This movie doesn't live up to the trailers....
","I hate to say this, but this could have been a good movie.  All great movies that shock in the end give some sort of hint throughout the movie that allows the viewer to formulate a hypothesis as to what is happening.  Not this movie.  It starts out great, then tragedy strikes, then the movie descends into chaos, and then an explanation of the chaos.  I actually thought that Tom Cruise's character was going crazy.  This is a viable and sound explanation, for there are many people that go crazy and hallucinate. I thought that it was a true portrait of insanity.  I could have lived with that explanation.  However, the ending was far worse.  I won't spoil it for you, but if you want to save some money, ask someone, and you'll see what I am talking about.  Don't see this film.  You will thank me later.",1,0,3,10 January 2002
Goodfellas," One of my personal favorites...
","This movie, to me, is what mafia life was all about.  It didn't over-dramatize anything.  The language, the ruthlessness, the lack of trust; this was a great film.  I especially liked the aspect of how that the main character was taken from being a young boy through his life into the present.  I liked the aspect of how that they were close knit.  To me, it was kinda like a little anthropology study of a strange type of community.I would recommend this movie to anyone that is interested in what life in the mafia is truly like.  It may seem graphic, but that is what makes it good.  There is no sugarcoating.  On the other hand, they don't dramatize it to the point of losing its luster either.  It is a 10.",10,0,0,15 February 1999
