Ford v Ferrari," It´s a film without emotion.
","It´s a film without emotion. Well filmed and with some of the best actors in the world, it practically transmits nothing. Love for cars, calling cars as if they were women, being moved by engine revolutions, have nothing to do with the current times of silent, electric and non-polluting cars. But above all they do not transmit anything, family situations, servility towards bosses, nor, how did he say any emotion.",5,3,8,2 February 2020
