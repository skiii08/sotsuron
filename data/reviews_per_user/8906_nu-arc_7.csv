"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Colourful.Creative And Stylish!
","When I watched this film this evening, I found it so hilarious, colorful, creative and very stylish. This is a very good film which tells you how colorful and creative gay people and Drag Queens are. And, of course, their wacky senses of humor and how cool they are to hang out with and such good friends you can make out of them. And, the usual which is revealed in gay movies, that stupid HOMOPHOBIA!! But in this movie, it makes fun of it. Homophobes are so small minded and so pathetic towards these gifted people. My god, this lets off to us how homophobes should grow up and leave the gay people alone! Anyways, this is one stylish movie. It is a true work of art!",8,0,1,17 December 2006
Kung Fu Panda," Beautiful!
","This was a cleverly produced, computer animated film! It had a brilliant concept which is suitable for all ages and be understood in many different ways from all ages. For children, it's fun and cuddly adventure and heroic action and for the mature level; it's deeply spiritual as it deals with one to never abuse one's power, never to stop believing in something, someone or oneself and everything happens for a reason.This film, however, is so powerful as it deals with one's spirits light and dark, the greatest ways of addressing ones' problems, nothing is impossible, people envy one another when they cannot be like him or her; and then, are respected once that task has been fulfilled. This is definitely a must see!!!",10,0,1,14 December 2008
Akira," 'Akira'.
","I heard about this film when I was reading a book which I had brought recently which was called 'Cinema Year By Year'. And I was dying to see this motion picture, and I got my chance to watch it last night.I could not believe my eyes when I watched Akira. The graphics were incredible and, that was not all, the entire movie was hand drawn. It sounded too crazy to be true, but it was!So realistic and very precise! And I did not believe it had a 1988 film release. AMAZING!! And the music was so wicked, it suited the movie for sure. Those thud sounds created a still and unknown atmosphere of the future Tokyo alright.If any of you out there are wanting to see it, you'd better. And you will be astonished, astounded and amazed.",10,2,5,17 December 2006
The Other Boleyn Girl," Incredible.
","A film with impressive cinematography and suspense which is built around the kingdom of Henry the 8th. There is a sensation of change which is about to happen. There are displays how England changed over the centuries and what rules ruled over the country at the time. And, vile consequences too if someone stepped out of line. The people, who were no different in behavior with the modern world also hated change; especially when Anne Bolyn decided to tell the King to divorce the Queen.This film,overall, was very factual; although fictionalized; it was very suspenseful and sensational. Enjoy!",7,0,0,6 January 2009
Brokeback Mountain," Shattering!
","This movie had romantic scenes with two cowboys falling in love. It was so sweet! And then, came the shattering moments. Annis (Heath Ledger) feared for Jack (Jake Gyllanhaal)that they will end up dead if they lived together as a couple. My God! That scene when Annis was 9, he was shown a dead man with his penis chopped off for being gay!! Shocking! And then, when Annis retrieved a letter from Jack that said he was deceased! According to Jack's wife, he died from a popped tyre but Annis believed that Jack was gay bashed!! And I could believe that, but it was easier to believe that he died from a popped tyre because, that was too shattering to believe in! But whatever happened to Jack, it just meant that Annis's and Jack's relationship was over! And after watching this film, it had such an effect on me and it made me cry for 4 days! Good Lord, Mankind....",10,19,23,2 October 2006
The Nightmare Before Christmas," We All Want To Try Something Different.
","Tim Burton's 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' was an enjoyable, poetic and musical film.And it was more than what I expected, I just thought it was probably a Christmas that went upside down for no reason. When in fact, the creatures from Halloween Town decided to do Christmas instead of Halloween. And the results, were shocking! LOL! There were so many shocks and scares on such a jolly occasion.The movie impressed me when I saw all the holiday occasions: Valentine's Day, Easter, Christmas and Halloween. This impressed me because, this was how Jack the Pumpkin King got to see what Christmas was about, behind that Christmas door, there was a blazing Jack O'Lantern for a sun in Halloween Town and 'Lamp O' Lanterns' for lam-posts. And, a Boogey man who likes to Boogey in that glowing lair of his.If you are studying animation, I suggest you watch 'behind the scenes'. It will be helpful if you are trying to create an animated film with plasticine models.",10,2,3,20 February 2007
Drag Me to Hell," How It Would Be Like To Be Plagued?!
","How would it be like to be plagued?!Terrifying, terrifying I tell you. Gypsies, I must say have always been a mystery to me (I don't know about others) and that is why people create these films about gypsy curses like Stephen King's Thinner for example. A fear might murk within us about making these mysterious people angry as they have been persecuted by society and thus might take their anger out of those of high power; just like what happened between Christine Brown and that sinister Gypsy grandmother who plagued her with a demon who would drag her to hell for not allowing the gypsy to keep her home.I don't want to spoil the rest, but this movie was so intense; and there are very disturbing parts to watch which may offend sensitive viewers. Tell me, would you kill in order to survive or would you rather be dragged to hell. I'd rather be dragged to hell. Watch the movie and you'll understand.",9,2,4,6 November 2009
