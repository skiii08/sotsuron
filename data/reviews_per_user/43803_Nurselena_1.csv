Hereditary," It had such potential ...... *spoilers*
","I have been waiting for a great horror movie. I spent $6 to rent this movie because everyone said it was 'amazing'.
 I want to start this by saying that Toni Colette deserves an Oscar for this and if I was her, I would have signed up for this movie too. The actors could not have performed any better than they did. Gabriel Byrne has been a crush of mine for decades. That being said, I wish I had saved my money. The writers should be ashamed. 
Halfway into this movie I was convinced that this was a piece about the devastation that mental illness can have on a family. We are given hints about the illness that runs in the line, such as Grandma's DID and Uncle's schizophrenia. As the movie continued and the 'visions' occurred, I thought the big twisty reveal would be that daughter and grandson have mental illness, triggered by horrible accidents and the terrible repercussions of watching a loved one slip into dementia and die. But, shame on me for thinking this movie would be intelligent. The big reveal is a Satanic pact that turns the son into a vessel for a Demi-god or Demon?!? Screw you, guys. Mental illness that is unchecked or ignored is so much scarier than supernatural garbage. Not to mention, your audience is much smarter than what you give us credit for. 
Stop the movie before you see the last 10 minutes. Trust me.",5,0,0,8 September 2018
