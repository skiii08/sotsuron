The Rock," An *action* movie...
","Some people think that this is a terrible movie. People say that the point of the car chase was to destroy things. Of course it was! The Rock is an *action* movie. You are supposed to see thing blow up, people shot, cars being crashed. As for the fact that the director changes camera angles often: it adds to the action. It's a boring action movie seeing one shot of an explosion. You want to see the thing being blown up, and then the people's expressions as they run away.To sum up my thoughts: It's an action movie, not a drama. Judge the movie according to its genre.",8,3,3,14 August 2001
