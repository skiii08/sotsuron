United 93," Exceptional and cathartic
","I hesitated watching this great movie. But now I'm glad I got up the nerve to sit through this exceptional piece of art.Greengrass walked through a minefield and created a masterpiece with this movie. His nomination for Best Director at the Oscars is so well deserved.I find myself viewing this movie again and again, I can't get it out of my mind. You've probably heard the many descriptions about how Greengrass's touch is pseudo-documentary in tone and style, a fly on the wall approach. We literally can't tell which players in this movie are actors and which ones are the real thing (with the exception of Ben Sliney and others).The depiction of the plane's passengers is heartfelt and subtle. Even the terrorists are fleshed out in such a way to provide greater insight into the evil things they did that day. Jamie Harding is excellent as the youngest terrorist who is so obviously filled with such self-righteous fanaticism that he, along with the others, could see the evil they were doing as somehow justified and an act of Allah/God. The looks on the faces of the players on the ground remind me of my own reaction - stunned disbelief and shock. Can this really be happening? It is enormously emotionally satisfying to see the passengers fight back as they do, as I hope I would do if I were there on the plane with them. The final moments of this movie are absolutely gripping and unforgettable. I can't imagine a more accomplished, more fitting treatment of the September 11th tragedy than this one.",10,3,5,28 January 2007
Brokeback Mountain," New American classic love story
","I was lucky to get a ticket to the second screening of Brokeback Mountain at the Toronto Int'l Film Fest in September, months before the well-deserved hype kicked in. This is an absolutely beautiful movie. From a gay man's perspective, the love story was both satisfying and heart-breaking.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal give equally moving and accomplished performances, although the story tends to focus more on Ledger's character. Heath is note perfect in this role. I didn't detect a false moment once from him. Regardless of whether or not he wins the Oscar, his performance in this movie will be watched and admired for years to come as a landmark in acting. I truly related to his character's internalized homophobia. Every gay man has been there before. In many ways, he represents the embodiment of shame and self-hate, a product of his American, western culture. The flashback showing his father take him as a boy to look at the dead body of some murdered gay man should be shown to every Christian fundamentalist out there who ever argued (and continue to argue) that homosexuality is a choice and that gay men and lesbians are nurtured by their environment. I've seen the movie three times now, and Heath brings tears to my eyes every time - he's so good. Jake is also incredible, sweet, nuanced, loving. He had the difficult part of being essentially the 'love interest' rather than the main character. By the end, he personifies the tragedy of hopes that never come to be - as captured perfectly by Lee with the cut between the flashback of Jake's longing and beautiful face next to Jake 20 years later worn down by the weight of dashed dreams, wondering what could have been. This is one of those movies where you find that you fully appreciate both performances of the two men, Heath and Jake, equally, but perhaps one before the other over time. I was first blown away by Heath's performance, which seemed to eclipse Jake's performance - but over time, I've learned to truly appreciate what Gyllenhaal did here and how utterly perfect his portrayal really is. The other performances in this movie are all first-rate, especially Michelle Williams who is the portrait of vulnerability in this movie. She deserves all the accolades she's received for this performance. Anne Hathaway did well too with very little screen time, but knocked it out of the park with the phone call scene at the end (incidentally, the only scene her character even had in the original short story.) The movie should become both an American love story classic, as well as a gay classic. Glad to have someone of Ang Lee's talent take on a project like this. What an amazing man he is!",10,713,1032,12 September 2005
The Queen," Exquisite, subtle, compassionate, extraordinary
","Helen Mirren's performance will likely win her an Oscar and she is most deserving of one for this role. You literally forget you're watching Mirren in this film - so subtle and so effective is her portrait of the living monarch. She manages to humanize the public figure, but still maintains her considerable dignity and mystique at the same time.Kudos to Stephen Frears for making so many intelligent choices in his direction: while the real Royal family might not appreciate the attention that this film presents, I would highly doubt they would take great offense to any of their portrayals in this film. It is honest and classy, without being exploitative.I especially appreciated Frears' decision to almost show nothing of the boys, William and Harry. We only see Charles comforting them the night of Diana's death, and catch glimpses of them once or twice more, but absolutely no dialogue. In a film that delves into the inner minds of the main players at such a tragic time, it was a classy choice not to turn the boys into film characters for this plot. It wasn't necessary.Instead, we focus on the real heart of this film - the tension between conservative tradition and modern sensibilities. The contrast between the Queen and PM Tony Blair is a perfect metaphor for this conflict.But it isn't all cut and dry, of course. The Queen is also portrayed here as stubborn and perhaps a little naive about the growing public mood sweeping the world following Diana's tragic death. Little of the Queen's well-documented and well-founded disdain for Diana is emphasized here. For those with a strong sense of history, we understand already what happened between Charles and Diana and how things went so poorly.The best scene in the film - when the Queen's jeep gets stuck in the river on her Balmoral estate and she spots a beautiful stag nearby. Later she learns the stag has been shot dead by hunters and she goes to see the body at a neighbouring estate to pay her respects in a way. What a beautiful metaphor! I have little doubt that this film will be seen as one of the best of the year. In addition to Mirren's Oscar nomination and likely win, I see 'The Queen' having an excellent chance at a Best Picture nod and many other nominations, including screenplay. Well done to EVERYONE involved.",10,1,2,17 October 2006
