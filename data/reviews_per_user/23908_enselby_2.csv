Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Phantom Turkey
","Ok. For a start, let's get this Jar Jar issue out of the way. Kids may have loved him. Some adults may have loved him. However, the way he was employed in the movie was somewhat contradictory. One minute we are expected to be feeling how overwhelmingly hopeless the big battle is. The next we are forced to witness Jar Jar's clown-like prancing among the throes of battle. How can Lucas justify such a contradictory. scene. I am not totally anti-Jar Jar. In some calmer moments i could see his comedic appeal. However, the battle scene felt like the gory first ten minutes of Saving Private Ryan, but with Jim Carrey flopping around doing misplaced Jerry Lewis routines.Darth Maul. Sorry, simply not terrifying. Darth Vader, now you could imagine that he would kill women, children and babies. Darth Maul. No. I would have been more scared had he been played by Arnold from Diffrent Strokes. Darth Arnold. Ewan Macgregor- one of the most lifeless performances from an otherwise accomplished actor. The script- probably the worst thing about The Phantom Menace. Contained about as much passion as a list of ingredients on the side of a can of beans. Awkward, and quite bewildering. Pod race. Cracking cinema, however. Though that scene seemed more the domain of Spielberg than Lucas for my money. George Lucas. Once a most promising director, but clearly not up to the task. It was obvious that he hadn't directed for far too long (which is a shame, considering he was capable of such a masterpiece as American Grafitti- a wonderful film). Finally, The Phantom Menace is a good enough kids film. But because if its primarily juvenile appeal it will never attain the epic quality of the three original Star Wars films.  See it, though. It's worth the ticket price at least.",Null,0,1,6 May 2000
Man on the Moon," Shock horror- Carrey in dramatic acting scandal!!
","I never really saw Taxi when i was a kid. Never knew of Kaufman's cutting edge exploits ('happenings') aimed at the American public. Also, i've never been much of a Jim Carrey fan, finding what i perceived as quasi-Jerry Lewis posturings just a little bit irritating. However, after viewing a couple of films i decided that was a little harsh. After seeing Man on the Moon, i realize he is an awfully gifted artist. Playing someone in a biopic isn't that difficult in itself. All it requires is an adequate enough amount of mimicry- an impersonation almost. For example, Val Kilmer's Jim Morrison comes to mind as a good charcterization, but with no actual life to the character. Carrey, however, one sensed there was a person underneath all those masks of Kaufman. He had splendid support from some actual members of the Taxi cast playing themselves. Courtney Love, in this, her second film for the excellent Milos Forman, shines- herself somewhat of a dramatic surprise in The People vs Larry Flynt. I should like to see Carrey get awards galore for this film, though i somehow think it won't happen. It would be a shame to see his promise unfulfilled, tossed aside for the Ace Ventura kind of films. My one regret was that i was never more aware of the real Andy Kaufman when i was younger. I like to think i'd have laughed then aswell.",8,0,0,7 May 2000
