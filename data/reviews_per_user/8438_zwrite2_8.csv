Ali," 'Ali' misses essence of Ali
","It's difficult to comprehend how 'Ali' can be too long and incomplete, can feature an excellent portrayal of the world's most charismatic person and be boring, and have many riveting scenes, but fail as a drama.Yet, 'Ali' is incomplete, boring, and a failed movie. The reason is that the movie misses a large part of the essence of Muhammad Ali.'Ali is often unfocused and unclear, bouncing from topic to topic and spending too much time on things like Ali's womanizing and an incredible 46 minutes in Zaire while ignoring large parts of his boxing career and inaccurately portraying some of his and The Nation of Islam's history.The movie should have focused on four areas where Ali was distinctive  his fight against the U.S. military, his religion, his personality, and his boxing ability. The movie includes a lot of material on all four of these subjects, but has a severe point-of-view problem.You can't understand the essence and impact of Ali without scenes which show how America viewed him. He was arguably the most HATED person in the USA for a few years in the 1960s and, perhaps, beyond and is now one of the most admired and popular people in the world. The transition was a result of Ali being extremely courageous, brash and charismatic.Yet, you'd never know from watching this movie that Ali was hated by the general public. Here is how I would have presented Ali and his distinctiveness:HIS FIGHT AGAINST THE MILITARY: I would have started the movie with Ali standing up to the U.S. government in 1966 when it drafted him into the Army and ended it with a scene showing how popular he became, perhaps the 1996 torch lighting ceremony at the Atlanta Olympics.Thus, I'd emphasize the powerful evading-the-draft scenes in 'Ali,' add scenes that showed how Americans viewed him during the Vietnam War, and include flashbacks with Ali winning the Olympics and world title, experiencing the evils of segregation, and gravitating toward Islam.Returning to live action, I'd show how Ali sacrificed the three-plus best years of his boxing career because of his strong principles. Interspersing Ali's legal battles with evidence that Americans avidly supported the Vietnam War in 1966, but opposed it by 1971, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Ali, could convey how perceptions of 'The Greatest' changed.HIS RELIGION: I'd be more explicit and accurate about how Ali joining The Nation of Islam contributed to Americans' hatred of him.The movie needed to explain the religion and Ali's theology more clearly (Ali saying 'I'll be who I want to be, not what you want me to be' doesn't cut it) and show how Americans regarded Malcolm X, Elijah Muhammad, and the religion itself as racist and dangerous. I'd also cut out the government spook nonsense and accurately explain the Malcolm-Elijah tiff (Malcolm was expelled for condoning JFK's assassination) or drop the subject.HIS PERSONALITY: The movie did a good job of showing Ali's personality, but not how it offended millions of people. I'm too young to recall the war debate, but I remember how my father despised Ali in the 1970s because he regularly bragged about himself and denigrated others.Americans despise the selfish, arrogant athletes of 2008, but Ali's personality was far more selfish and arrogant than Barry Bonds' and others. 'Ali' should have illustrated how Americans were turned off by Ali's personality by emphasizing his conflict with Joe Frazier. Millions sided with the hard-working, soft-spoken Christian. He still hates Ali, who called him a gorilla.HIS BOXING ABILITY: Ali was unique. He transformed the image of a profession dominated by inarticulate brutes who attacked and attacked because he had incredible defensive abilities, evasiveness, footwork, dancing, and athleticism as well as very fast hands.The movie shows little of his dancing  and certainly gives no evidence that this was distinctive. 'Ali' needed to include perspectives of boxing analysts who could explain to viewers how truly great he was. It also should have had a five- to 10-minute 'Raging Bull'-style summary of his dozens of victories that weren't even mentioned.Interestingly, the boxing scenes were absolutely fabulous although they didn't convey the essence of Ali. They were extremely realistic unlike the rock 'em/sock 'em robot scenes of 'Rocky' and other movies which show Boxer A smashing Boxer B 20 times in a row before somehow Boxer B comes back as if he hadn't been hit at all. I was so impressed by the 'Ali' boxing scenes that I was tempted to go back to my review of 'Rocky' and deduct a point.Where to cut? Well, Ali's womanizing was NOT distinctive. A huge percentage of famous people womanize. Ali was too interesting to dredge up his relationships, and they detract from the more interesting elements of his life. Yes, he said he was religious. Grow up America. Religious people cheat too  and always have.As for the 46 minutes on Zaire, if the Ali-Foreman battle was that interesting, it should be a separate movie. Wait a second. It was  'When We Were Kings.' Forty-six minutes here is pointless repetition. Also: I don't care about Bundini Brown's personal problems. He should have been used to illustrate how he helped Ali become a quasi-poet.As I said in my first graph, the movie has many positive elements. Will Smith, for example, has Ali's cadences and attitude down pat and deserved an Oscar nomination. He doesn't quite convey his charisma, but no one can.I give 'Ali' a 6.ZWrite",6,2,3,14 March 2008
Glory," Great history lesson illustrated by fantastic storytelling
","'Glory' is a great movie with strong, multifaceted characters who have numerous intriguing conflicts. More importantly, 'Glory' is a very important movie.I'm a History aficionado, but I knew nothing about the story of the first all-African American regiment of Civil War soldiers  a 600-person regiment led by a handful of white officers. More movies like this should be made because they can, frankly, help make the American people smarter about history and spur them to learn more.It's true that the individual African-American soldiers in 'Glory' are fictional people in the middle of the portrayal of actual events, but the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Regiment was real. If I find out that the writers had in-depth information on actual soldiers, I'll be disappointed. In the meantime, I'll praise the history lessons imparted by the movie.'Glory' does an excellent job portraying the different kinds of whites and blacks who lived in the Civil War era  abolitionists, anti-black Union soldiers, corrupt Union officers, educated free blacks, uneducated blacks, and blacks who were understandably angry and rebellious after years of slavery and other moral outrages.Although the individuals portrayed are fictional, their character types can be used in a classroom to teach Civil War history. 'Glory' is not exactly 'JFK'  an abomination that has dishonestly taught ignorant young Americans lies about history.'Glory,' though, would be a great movie even if it wasn't a valuable history lesson. The movie is a storytelling masterpiece. It does a splendid job of introducing the main characters and focuses on just the right amount of people  four black soldiers and three white officers. All these characters are strongly developed, and the writing lures viewers into following their progress.The strong characters set up a long list of interesting character conflicts that dominate the movie and kept me riveted. My list includes the regiment's white abolitionist commander vs. his deputy/lifelong friend, the commander vs. a white officer who harshly disciplines blacks, the commander vs. an educated black man he knew in Boston, an angry black man vs. the educated black man, and the angry black vs. the leader of the blacks portrayed by Morgan Freeman.Each of these conflicts is bolstered by well-written dialogue that often includes dramatic and intriguing confrontations.There are also at least three supporting characters in the Union Army that the lead character, Col. Robert Gould Shaw (played by Matthew Broderick), has conflicts with as he fights for the rights of his African-American troops to have adequate equipment and fight the Confederates.In addition, there are group conflicts that fit seamlessly into the plot  white officers trying to train black soldiers, blacks fighting to be treated as equals, white bigots vs. white non-bigots, Union soldiers and officers persevering despite Confederate threats to execute them for race mixing, and the North vs. the South.Actual letters written by the real Shaw are used as voice-overs. They give an insight into a man who is empathetic to blacks, has hopes and fears about the Civil War and his regiment, and makes observations about his soldiers' off-the-field culture and camaraderie. His letters make his behavior even more interesting as he evolves into a commander who is often tough toward his trainees.Although Col. Shaw becomes strong and principled, the evolution of the educated (Thomas) and angry black (played by Denzel Washington) men are even more interesting. Thomas evolves from a privileged man who is a terrible soldier into a profile in courage who overcomes gun wounds to save the life of his personal enemy, Washington, and becomes an outstanding warrior.Washington is in one great scene after another as he evolves from a selfish, angry man who initiates fights into a war hero who learns how to channel his excessive energy. I generally don't comment on acting, but Washington is spectacular. He earned his Best Supporting Actor award!! I felt like I was watching his character, not him, particularly as he maintained his composure while staring at Col. Shaw as he gets whipped in one of the five best movie scenes I've ever seen.Washington's intensity in the whipping scene and others (fighting for equal pay, challenging racist white soldiers, lecturing Thomas) leaps off the screen. Sean Penn is a very good actor, but I'm consciously aware it's him when I watch him, and I get the impression he's calibrating how intense he can be without losing his credibility.'Glory' was even better when I watched it for a second time. I was tempted to give it a 10, but there were a few inexplicable alterations to actual history (Shaw's death was more dramatic in real life), there were minor pacing problems, and I was disappointed that there is not a scene at the end that showed which of the main characters survived. Did they all die? I give 'Glory' a 9.ZWrite",9,0,1,9 March 2008
The Caine Mutiny," Flawed movie, but some very gripping scenes
","Humphrey Bogart's performance in 'The Caine Mutiny' was the second-best of his career. Only his performance in 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,' one of Hollywood's best-ever, was better. And, yes, I did watch 'Casablanca.'Bogart's outstanding acting makes the movie's gripping scenes even more compelling. The best scene is his falling apart on the witness stand  a sort of subdued version of Jack Nicholson's memorable breakdown in 'A Few Good Men.' The other great scenes were when Van Johnson takes over command of the ship as Bogart vacillates during a typhoon and the hunt for the missing strawberries.Throughout 'Caine,' the writers do a good job of showing how Bogart's Captain Queeg is an incompetent officer and one of those petty jerks everybody hates  a compulsive authoritarian who tries to make up for his lack of substance by focusing on rules so he is always right and everyone else is wrong.The confrontation between Bogart and his subordinates, the disputes between the officers about what to do about Queeg, the transformation of the Van Johnson character, and the canniness and cowardice of the Fred MacMurray character are also positive elements in the movie.All this makes the ending absolutely infuriating. Jose Ferrer's speech is beyond ludicrous. It's based on two premises  MacMurray was the brains behind the mutiny and the mutiny was unjustified. Half the movie is about MacMurray laying the groundwork for the mutiny so Ferrer's conclusion is news only to himself.The second premise is just dumb. Bogart had acted incompetently and cowardly at sea twice before the typhoon  and blamed others for his mistakes. Ferrer's declaration that Johnson would not have had to act against Bogie during the typhoon if officers had months earlier accepted their captain's plea for help  and Johnson agreeing with Ferrer  makes no sense. Lives were in danger during the typhoon. Period.The conclusion has the stench of U.S. Navy censorship.I noticed that many IMDb posters rip the romance between the young officer and his girlfriend. This is interesting since there are countless 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s movies with unconvincing romances that appear to be patronizing attempts to win over female viewers, and many of those romances are barely criticized.The romance in this movie is less distracting and time-consuming than many others. At least I can see what the writers were trying to do  make us interested in the young officer so we viewers care about what happens to him later on. This works up to a point. It ultimately does NOT work -- not because the romance is uninteresting, but because the officer's character is NOT developed. He is an uninteresting observer for most of 'Caine,' and he is a milquetoast when he takes stands on principle later in the film.Robert Francis' lack of development in 'Caine' compares unfavorably to the transformations of Jack Lemmon and Charlie Sheen in 'Mister Roberts' and 'Platoon.' It doesn't help that Francis is not a good actor.The writers should have spent more time developing Francis' character instead of using 35 minutes before Bogart enters the movie or they should have downplayed Francis and focused on Van Johnson instead.I gave 'Caine' a 7.ZWriteP.S. -- By the way, nominating the actor who played Queeg's predecessor instead of MacMurray for a Best Supporting Oscar is preposterous.",7,12,15,17 September 2007
Chariots of Fire," Movie should have been less 'boring'
","The debate about 'Chariots of Fire' has always been whether it is boring. As a young man, I thought it was very boring. As a middle-aged man, I found it far less boring this week.Let me suggest, though, that the debate should be far more substantive  whether the writers did a good job of portraying the two main characters and the rivalry between them. If the answer was yes, 'Chariots' would have been much less boring.The movie has three problems: 1. ERIC LIDDELL'S PORTRAYAL: This man was fascinating. He sacrificed his life while in his 40s because he was a Christian missionary in China. Yet, he is NOT portrayed as fascinating.We're told he wants to be a missionary, but we should have been SHOWN this. This could have been done via flashbacks to his childhood when his parents were missionaries or via his missionary work if there was any. Speeches to Scottish lads just don't convey his zeal. Instead, we see a relatively cardboard-cutout portrayal of a very religious person.2. HAROLD ABRAHAMS' PORTRAYAL: I'm Jewish. There has been virtually no discrimination against me, but my father and others of his generation have told me stories that were far more interesting than anything Abrahams went through in this movie.The stories I've heard were about discrimination in 1950s New York City. It is not credible that Abrahams didn't suffer far more bias in 1920s England. Snide remarks by snotty old men and Abrahams' plaintive wail that was mocked by his girlfriend just aren't interesting. The writers should have found out about the anti-Semitic incidents that undoubtedly occurred.3. THE LIDDELL ABRAHAMS RIVALRY: Liddell won one race and Abrahams was upset about it. They barely talked to each other!! It's hard to believe their rivalry couldn't have been more vividly portrayed. Did they like each other? What did they say to each other and about each other? There was relatively little tension between them.Confrontations make plots less boring. Two of the best scenes in 'Chariots' are Abrahams telling officials that he won't fire his coach and Liddell telling them he will not run on the Sabbath. The movie would have been much better if Abrahams and Liddell had confrontations regarding their religion with others and personal tiffs with each other.I had one other problem with 'Chariots.' After watching it, I researched whether Abrahams and Liddell won medals in races not portrayed on screen. They did. In the course of this research, I noticed that NO hurdler named Andrew Lindsay medaled in the 1924 Olympics. Upon further research, I learned Lindsay does NOT exist.I understand that writers often take creative license with the truth. I read 'Schindler's List.' In the movie, there were at least a few incidents where the Itzhak Stern character did things that in real life were actually done by others. This was understandable because too many characters can confuse viewers and introducing them can waste lots of time.However, Stern was real, he was portrayed accurately, and the incidents involving him were close to accurate. Other incidents like Schindler rescuing an employee from a train heading toward a concentration camp did occur although it was not Stern who was rescued.What the writers of 'Chariots' did in fabricating a person when they had several British runners, some of them medalists, to base a composite character around was UNFORGIVABLE.After watching 'Chariots of Fire,' I gave it a 6. But, I penalized it one point afterward for making up Lindsay. My rating is 5.ZWrite",5,8,16,2 January 2008
Rocky," Childhood favorite holds up
","As a teen, 'Rocky' was my favorite movie. It was, in fact, the first movie I saw without my parents. In college, I ran up the Philadelphia Museum of Art's stairs a la Rocky.The David vs. Goliath theme is so appealing to a student that I thought over the years that I probably overrated the movie and ignored many of its flaws. That judgment was reinforced by my knowing that endless sequels had made Rocky a caricature and Sylvester Stallone did not become a quality actor. In retrospect, I thought the characters were too broad and stereotypical.A few days ago, I analyzed the movie for the first time. I was stunned. I completely forgot how good the beginning of the movie was!! Director John Avildsen did a superb job of conveying the grittiness of Rocky's Philadelphia neighborhood and the sadness and despair of his life. I was interested in the character from the start as he fights for a $50 prize, roams the neighborhood alone, and is thrown out of his locker because he failed to fulfill his potential.Stallone is outstanding portraying Rocky as tough and dumb, but likable. He refuses to break the thumbs of a man who could not pay his loan shark boss and tries to help a man lying in the street and a troubled girl. Frankly, I did not recall the depth of Rocky's kind-hearted tough guy character.I didn't forget the excellent conflicts and dialogues between the major characters  Rocky, girlfriend Adrian, her brother, manager Mickey, and boxing champ Apollo Creed. However, the scenes depicting Rocky and Adrian's first date were even better than I recalled because Talia Shire is very convincing portraying a woman afraid to be with a man and Stallone's pangs of loneliness on Thanksgiving and awkwardness around women are very endearing.I must admit, though, that I recalled Rocky's rejection of Mickey's offer to manage him as a dialogue. In fact, it was two monologues  and the movie's best scene. Each monologue brilliantly captured the talker's frustration that no one had ever helped him achieve his goals. Mickey spoke first, begging Rocky for a chance at age 76. Rocky responded by essentially kicking him out of his apartment and venting at a door. The scene meant more to me in middle age than it did as a teen.But, 'Rocky' is definitely flawed. I found Adrian's post-first date transformation from a near mute afraid to enjoy life to a vibrant, articulate woman now that she no longer wears glasses as absurd as I did in 1976. And how did her vision improve? Contact lenses were costly then.There are two boxing-related flaws that I didn't notice in 1976. One is that I've always thought the match was on July 4 and Rocky trained like a maniac for seven months. Since the match was on Jan. 1, his transformation into a freakishly-conditioned Superman is less plausible.I've also always thought that Creed won easily because the announcers were astonished that Rocky stayed on his feet. I never noticed that the result was actually a 2-1 decision. The focus at the end of the movie was rightly Rocky lasting 15 rounds and then looking for Adrian rather than listening to the result. The fact that the match was actually close detracts from the excellent ending.'Rocky II' was pointless. 'Rocky III' was better than 'II,' but essentially about a celebrity that I didn't care much about. I never watched the others, but it's refreshing to know that the first 'Rocky' was as good as I remembered it. I gave it a 9.ZWrite",9,1,1,7 November 2007
Hoosiers," Too formulaic to be great
","If 'Hoosiers' was the first movie I'd ever seen, I'd give it a 10.This movie has all the elements of a great story. It's, on the surface, an exciting movie depicting a shorthanded boys basketball team from a tiny high school that is inspired to overachieve by a middle-aged coach seeking redemption. Most viewers surely root for the players and coach.In addition, 'Hoosiers' has, on the surface, many very interesting external and internal character conflicts. The coach, played by Gene Hackman, battles the town's old-timers, who are resistant to outsiders and anyone with new ideas and methods. The coach also battles players unaccustomed to working hard on defense and passing as well as a teacher/assistant principal who is more interested in academics than sports.The stories of a drunk ex-basketball star being given a chance to be an assistant coach and a star player who won't join the team until he respects the coach are also, on the surface, compelling.'Hoosiers,' though, is not the first movie I've seen. In fact, I've watched plenty of movies that have excellent stories like 'Hoosiers' does, but also have way more depth beneath the surface. In short, this movie is way too formulaic and unsurprising to be great.How was 'Hoosiers' unsurprising? As I watched Hackman's character meet and argue with the teacher played by Barbara Hershey, I jotted down a prediction that they would have a romance. Check. As I watched the principal tell Hackman that Jimmy, who was not on the team, was a great player, I predicted that he would return to the squad and lead it to the championship. Check. And, obviously, I knew Hackman would win over his players and the town.Nevertheless, 'Hoosiers' would have been outstanding if it had depth and more interesting characters. 'Rocky' was formulaic in many ways, but it had quirky characters who were developed, surprising and compelling scenes, and passionate dialogue.'Hoosiers,' though, didn't thoroughly develop characters like Jimmy and the assistant coach played by Dennis Hopper, dealt superficially with subplots, and had dialogue that had the feel of trite coach sportspeak rather than moving in-depth conversations.Defending the film's formulaic nature by saying it's based on a true story just doesn't cut it because it is NOT close to being non-fiction. In fact, I wonder how people came to believe the movie was based on reality.Wikipedia's list of differences between reality and 'Hoosiers' is very long. This might be typical, but the movie's two major premises differ from reality. The real coach was not a hotheaded middle-aged single guy and Milan High was a preseason favorite, not an underdog.I know my review focuses on the negative. This is because I am trying to make the point that 'Hoosiers' had a chance for greatness, but came up short.The truth is that 'Hoosiers' is still a pretty good movie. I give it a 7.ZWrite",7,2,4,24 July 2008
Paths of Glory," The best movie that I previously never heard of!!
","I watch about 100 movies per year, but I NEVER heard of 'Paths of Glory' until I recently saw it on a list of great movies.It is the BEST movie that I have never heard of and one of the best movies I have ever seen!! I'm stunned that I knew nothing about it.As an anti-war movie, 'Paths of Glory' rivals 'All Quiet on the Western Front' and 'Dr. Strangelove.' It has one great scene after another. Most of the scenes consist of two- or three-person conversations that include very smart dialogue, sharp character portrayals, and conflicts that induce viewers to root for some people and root against others.During the movie, I became depressed when something bad happened to the good guys and happy when something bad happened to the bad guys. I can't think of too many movies that were written so well that I reacted this way.I know many people, including myself, don't like military movies with so much action that you can't follow who has been killed and who is winning. This movie wisely has only about 10 minutes of (World War I) battlefield scenes and the result is crystal-clear.Instead of scenes of mass killings, the writers and director Stanley Kubrick focus on the confrontations between high-level and low-level officers, an unfair court martial, and a farcical trial. The results of the action convey vividly how military leaders care more about themselves than the heroes who fight for their nation.The movie also wisely has one central character played by Kirk Douglas. He is outstanding as a very principled and strong mid-level officer who essentially represents the perspective of viewers like ourselves. Like Douglas, we want to express moral outrage as the plot unfolds.I almost gave this movie a 10, but I thought the ending was too sudden. I wanted it to continue. I'm also on the fence about whether I preferred this movie to either be about English soldiers or French soldiers with French accents or left as is with French soldiers who are clearly not French.I swear I'm not normally a cheerleader for movies. In fact, I think I gave a movie that came out at about the same time a 1. The fact that Gigi won a Best Movie Oscar and 'Paths of Glory' received zero nominations is a stain on Academy Award voters.I gave 'Paths' a 9.ZWrite",9,9,12,13 April 2007
Jurassic Park," More science, less adventure needed
","The very concept of dinosaurs coming back to life is so fascinating that 'Jurassic Park' had the potential to be one of the best movies ever. At minimum, it should have earned a 10 rating.Unfortunately, director Steven Spielberg and the writers did not spend enough time teaching us  perhaps, via the film's children  about dinosaurs. Instead, there are too many dumbing-down scenes with dinosaurs relentlessly hunting people and humans doing all sorts of incredible gymnastics to stay alive.On the plus side, the movie has several 'wow' moments involving gentle dinosaurs. The special effects are tremendous. When the characters first saw dinosaurs on the island near Costa Rica, I felt as awestruck as they did. Later, we see a dinosaur born in a lab, Laura Dern's character helping a sick dinosaur, a dinosaur eating plants a few feet away from Sam Neill's character and the two children, and dozens of gazelle-like dinosaurs sprinting away from a massive meat-eating predator. These scenes were spectacular.There are also a couple of interesting scenes focusing on the mean carnivorous dinosaurs. But, the meat eaters just don't stop chasing the humans. The action goes on and on and on. The longer these scenes go on, the more 'Jurassic' evolves from a fascinating science fiction story into a trite action-adventure.I'm for action-adventure, and liked that the plot included a greedy computer expert played by Newman of 'Seinfeld' conspiring to steal dinosaur DNA. Newman's comeuppance was enjoyable, and 'Jurassic' was better because his behavior caused the dinosaurs to escape from their habitats and go after innocent people.But, there were many times that I wanted the pace to slow down and listen to the dinosaur experts played by Dern and Neill discuss the various species of dinosaurs. I also wanted to see more scenes with different species interacting with each other, more everyday scenes of dinosaurs doing whatever dinosaurs do, and even more scenes of the people interacting with the gentle dinosaurs.Spielberg, I think, missed a wonderful opportunity to educate the public in an entertaining way. An excellent movie would have balanced education and entertainment, but 'Jurassic' took a mid-story turn toward entertainment, and I wasn't particularly entertained.The dinosaurs the movie focused on were more like people obsessed with winning. As far as I know, animals chase their prey, succeed or fail, and then look for other prey. They don't fail, but then spend hours looking for the prey that escaped from them instead of looking for other prey. If dinosaurs are that smart, I would have liked to hear the dinosaur experts discuss what else they could do.Spielberg deserves credit for inserting personal touches in the middle of his action-adventure and developing the Neill character from a child-hater into a child-lover although his quick transformation was a bit implausible. I also liked the comic relief of Jeff Goldblum's character, but the writers needed to explain better why a statistical theorist/philosopher was in the movie in the first place.I also think that the Richard Attenborough character was too much like the Dr. Frankenstein character. Here, was a brilliant entrepreneur who spent years pursuing his dream of re-creating life. Then, as soon as his experiment goes awry, he  like Frankenstein  wants to abandon his dream. The ending would have been better if viewers were left thinking about whether dinosaurs coming back to life was a good or bad thing instead of watching a black-and-white anti-dinosaur position.I cast an 8 for 'Jurassic Park' when I initially voted on it, but the more I think and write about it, the more I conclude it deserves a 7 instead because it really missed an opportunity to be great.ZWrite",7,4,7,28 July 2008
