Hereditary," The only thing scary about this movie is the amount of money I wasted on it
","My grandpa and I went to see this. We believed the positive reviews so thought we should see what the fuss was about. Where do I begin, the beginning of the movie is extremely boring and provides nothing interesting to keep you interested let alone awake. It's not just bad but it's not even believable. If you killed your sister you'd just go up to your room and sleep. REALLY. Toni Colletes performance is extremely overacted. One moment shes all lovey dovey then she's an insane psychopath. This movie has no plot and the moments where it builds up you may think something scary is about to happen but nothing ends up happening. My grandpa and I were embarrassed when we walked out of the theater. It's too bad we can't get that waste of a 2 hours back. For those of you saying this is as scary as the exorcist then you haven't seen good horror. The only thing scary about this movie is wasting your money on it",1,3,7,12 November 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Pretty good
",I thought this was a good sequel to expand the pirates universe. No it's not perfect but it was enough to satisfy me.,8,0,0,6 May 2020
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A fun adventure
",This is probably one of my favorite movies definitely in my top 10! This is by far the best pirates movie made. Has a great story great characters you can invest in and has captain barbossa as a fantastic villain. 9.5/10 I recommend it,10,0,0,6 May 2020
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Not the best not the worst
",I'll start off by saying this would easily be an 8 or a 9 if it wasn't so long. Its almost 3 hours which I felt it could've been shorter. Some parts are hard to get through but it makes up for it with the last 45 minutes with an amazing climax and resolution.,7,0,0,6 May 2020
