The King's Speech," THE KING'S SPEECH (Tom Hooper, 2010) ***1/2
","Though I have had it for some time, I decided to watch this the day after its Oscar triumph – since I had an inkling THE SOCIAL NETWORK (2010) was not going to make it (I was still surprised that the director of that one, David Fincher, lost out to a newcomer). Like most viewers, I am wary of a British costumer (though the period in this case was not too far removed from the present) but, since this came in the form of a history lesson (apart from the nominal human drama), the result proved more palatable than usual. That said, Hooper's directorial style here seems to rely a lot on unusual angles (even if these were not really necessitated by this type of genteel fare).The major contributing factors to the film's success are a witty script (by 73 year-old David Seidler, who also emerged a winner at this year's Oscars) and, of course, the ensemble acting from a variety of thespians. Colin Firth is the stuttering King George VI – the virtually 'uncontested' recipient of the Best Actor Oscar (in a role typically favored by the Academy). Nominee Helena Bonham-Carter appears as Firth's understanding but feisty wife, ditto Geoffrey Rush his iconoclastic speech therapist (he and Firth, incidentally, had already appeared together in another Best Picture upset i.e. Shakespeare IN LOVE [1998]) – in a way, his role here recalls his own Oscar-winning turn as a schizophrenic pianist in SHINE (1996), while his Executive Producer credit guaranteed the film end incongruously on a close-up of himself! In support are Guy Pearce as the somewhat immature King Edward VIII (who was forced to abdicate the throne because of his illicit affair with an American divorcée'), Derek Jacobi as the pompous Archbishop Of Canterbury, Michael Gambon as the confrontational King George V, Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill, Anthony Andrews as Former PM Stanley Baldwin (who also tendered his resignation in view of a tolerant attitude shown towards Hitler's European offensive), and Claire Bloom as the Queen during Gambon's rule – oddly enough, I failed to recognize the last two mentioned! The premise is simple enough: Firth's speech impediment threatens his role as the country's regal voice (brought to the fore with the advent of radio and, though only the Duke Of York, he was forced to assume this responsibility due to Gambon's final illness and Pearce's controversial private life). Though he had tried every manner of quack doctor, his wife is adamant that he overcome this problem – eventually, he goes to an Australian who thinks nothing of his patient's rank, treating him as an equal and calling him with the diminutive Bertie. For this reason, the two start off on the wrong foot but then settle down to business – via vocal coaching, incorporating tongue-twisting phrase and swearing(!), and physical exercise – only to clash again over what appears to be Rush's meddling with affairs of State, before the ultimate 'miracle' is performed. In fact, the King gets through his all-important address to the nation when war breaks out virtually without a hiccup, pardon the pun. The best scenes are the afore-mentioned dissolution of the 'partnership' set in a park, the Coronation rehearsal which also involves the scheming Jacobi's revelation that Rush has no medical qualifications (he is a 'failed actor' who learned his 'craft' assisting shell-shocked soldiers during WWI!), and the predictably stirring finale – both in view of the sentiments in the statement being read and, of course, Firth's personal accomplishment.",8,0,0,5 March 2011
Black Swan," BLACK SWAN (Darren Aronofsky, 2010) ***1/2
","I had first read about this at the time of its Venice Film Festival presentation, where the picture was (unsurprisingly but rather misleadingly) compared by many to Dario Argento's supernatural shocker SUSPIRIA (1977). Consequently, I went into BLACK SWAN (nothing to do, of course, with the classic Tyrone Power swashbuckler from 1942) expecting more horror elements than were actually on offer, but I was still very much impressed with the end result. Back then, the movie was not really talked of as the Oscar contender it is clearly shaping up to be; still, two-thirds of the way in I was perhaps ready to consider it overrated myselfthat is, until the last act kicked in and took the film to a whole new level! Needless to say, given the ballet milieu, parallels to The Archers' THE RED SHOES (1948) could not be avoided (it even contrives a similarly tragic denouement!). However, many another individualistic film-maker's style has also been applied to Aronofsky's effort: from Roman Polanski (with shades of REPULSION [1965] being especially felt throughout) to Davids Cronenberg (due to its adopting his trademark 'body-horror' device) and Lynch (the whole plays out like one of the director's surreal trips into the human psyche, and MULHOLLAND DRIVE [2001] in particular).Being one of the major contributing factors to the film's success, a word is obviously in order now about the cast. Naturally, we begin with Natalie Portman: hers has aptly been described a courageous performance – in the Isabelle Adjani POSSESSION (1981) mould – not least because of scenes involving masturbation and lesbianism; having just recently watched Chloe Grace Moretz in LET ME IN (2010), I could not help recalling Portman's own prodigious start as a teen in Luc Besson's LEON (1994). I do not think I have ever watched Mila Kunis in anything prior to BLACK SWAN, but the favorable notices she has been getting for this role are well-deserved – managing to leave a mark even when the show clearly belongs to Portman. While Vincent Cassel is better than usual here, he is hardly in the same class as Anton Walbrook from THE RED SHOESand since his character promises us a visceral re-imagining of the Tchaikovsky opus, I was ultimately disappointed that the unfolding horror proved to be of the 'all-in-the-mind' variety! Barbara Hershey's possessive mother, then, lends the film a distinct CARRIE (1976) vibe. As for Winona Ryder, I guess one needs to commend her for being such a sport in accepting the role of a has-been; incidentally, the scene where Portman returns to the now-crippled Ryder the 'mementos' she had pilfered when star-struck of her emerges as its most poignant moment.Performers driven to the edge for the sake of art (and fame) has long been a cinematic staple, but it has rarely been done so vividly and with such tremendous punch; truth be told, I have always wondered in films like these just how talented actors could be made to play down their gift in scenes where they are not supposed to meet their on-screen taskmaster's standards, or whether the artist behind the camera at times needed to exert himself as much as the one in front of it in order to coax what he was striving for out of his cast! Reflection, too, plays a pivotal part in the narrative: mirrors are omnipresent, while several characters deliberately look alike (so that Portman often sees herself in others!) – preparing one for the bravura sequence where the heroine undergoes a 'literal' metamorphosis from her guise of White Swan (i.e. gauche, virginal) into the Black one (embodying malevolence and seductiveness). No less important, however, is the disquieting score – which, apparently, consists of a variation on 'Swan Lake' itself played in reverse! Having watched all of Aronofsky's feature films, I would probably rank this as his finest yet – with THE WRESTLER (2008), his acclaimed previous release, placing close behind it. On the other hand, I am not over-the-moon as many others are about the rest of the director's work – finding PI (1998) too muddled, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM (2000) too depressing, and THE FOUNTAIN (2006) too ambitious for their own good!",8,4,19,22 December 2010
The New World," THE NEW WORLD {General Release Version} (Terrence Malick, 2005) ***
","Few directors can film nature the way Terrence Malick can which, coupled with James Horner's mysterious yet evocative score, make this epic feel closer to Werner Herzog's AGUIRRE, THE WRATH OF GOD (1973) than THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS (1992) - to make it has been compared. Besides, the weird ritual scenes when Colin Farrell is first captured by the natives, seem to have strayed in from APOCALYPSE NOW (1979)!! However, impressive visuals - including the appropriately savage battle scenes - aren't enough to offset the general pretentiousness - which also affected Malick's previous effort, THE THIN RED LINE (1998) - that results from the relentless voice-over (which becomes alienating after a while, and is usually muffled to boot!) and especially its disorientating fragmentary style (which does no favors to individual characterization or the sweeping narrative, and is filled with inexplicable jump-cuts!).Q'Orianka Kilcher comes off best from the large cast, since she appears throughout the entire film - whereas Farrell more or less vanishes during the last third to make way for Christian Bale. Christopher Plummer is commanding in his brief but pivotal role, but David Thewlis is wasted as a sneering villain - while John Savage's role as a demented priest and that of Jonathan Pryce as King James I barely register! THE NEW WORLD originally premiered in a 150-minute cut (the General Release Version loses some 15 minutes), which only played for one week in selected theatres in the U.S. Ironically, this happened when I was in Hollywood at the end of last year and, had I known it would have been re-edited, I'd have made my utmost to catch this alternate edit of the film before it disappeared, perhaps forever!",7,2,6,2 June 2006
Howl's Moving Castle," HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE (Hayao Miyazaki, 2004) ***
","Prior to this, I had only watched two of Miyazaki's celebrated animated features - PRINCESS MONONOKE (1997) and SPIRITED AWAY (2001), though when I was in Hollywood recently I missed out on TCM's retrospective of his work - and, as with those films, HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE (which, incidentally, I had failed to catch on the big screen when it premiered during the 2004 Venice Film Festival, due to all the shows being sold-out!) is a great showcase of the Japanese master's visionary genius; however, it also features his typical faults - to me, at least - of presenting an over-ambitious (and overly weird) plot line which, due to its excessive length, tends to overstay its welcome and ends up in being an overwhelming (if not necessarily memorable) visual experience! As usual the detail is immaculate and the scale of the whole thing impressive - but what really holds the film together, for me, are the amiable anthropomorphic characters (Turnip the Scarecrow, Calcifer the Fire Demon and Heen the Dog) rather than the 'human' leads, the villains, or even the elements of fantasy so prevalent in this particular film-maker's admittedly unique brand of art.",7,1,3,18 March 2006
Walk the Line," WALK THE LINE (James Mangold, 2005) ***
","This is the best of the recent spate of musical biopics - BEYOND THE SEA (2004; about Bobby Darin), DE-LOVELY (2004; Cole Porter) and RAY (2004; Ray Charles) - with excellent leading performances, period detail and individual dramatic sequences. While I'm not all that familiar with Johnny Cash's discography, his music is effectively utilized throughout - and surely one of the most impressive feats of the film is that we're hearing Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon's own voices during the songs! Still, even if the film is based on true events, the plot offers little variety and basically alternates between clashes with Father, touring engagements, the blossoming romance between Cash and June Carter, arguments with the wife (usually over the latter) and drug abuse. Also, Cash's guilt complex over his brother's death as a kid is perhaps given excessive importance (a similar episode in RAY was also milked for all it was worth).",7,2,2,18 August 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat: Cultural Learnings Of America For Make Benefit Glorious Nation Of Kazakhstan (Larry Charles, 2006) **1/2
","I wasn't into Sacha Baron Cohen's previous alter ego, rapper Ali G, at all; I didn't think I'd be drawn to this character (who has garnered as much admiration as contempt either), given his sexist nature  but, at least, it provides a wider range of targets and opportunities for controversy. Incidentally, the head-shaking reaction which usually greets Borat is ultimately more of a comment on his ostensibly cultured 'victims' than the unsophisticated hero himself.The film itself is patchy but mercifully short  and, surprisingly, I found it to be genuinely inspired at times (even if its brand of savage no-holds barred satire has been more stylishly explored by Monty Python 35 years ago); besides, the dinner-table defecation was much better done by Luis Bunuel in an unforgettable scene from THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY (1974)! Anyway, it generally plays like a live-action version of 'South Park' (that series' creators, in fact, receive a special thanks during the end credits here).Some scenes are undeniably uproarious  his rendition of the national anthem of Kazakhstan at a rodeo; the dinner sequence in a Southern household (mentioned above); the mayhem at an antique shop; and the lengthy nude fisticuff between Borat and his heavy-set manager (which is where the film really oversteps the threshold of grossness). However, other 'sketches' fall miserably flat  in particular, the entire Pamela Anderson episode (which actually takes about half the running-time!) is an embarrassment: this section includes Borat's meeting with a group of wasted kids in a trailer (which is how the hero gets wise to Anderson's marital status) and his eventual brush with a community of revivalist Christians.",6,2,7,15 June 2007
The Incredible Hulk," THE INCREDIBLE HULK (Louis Leterrier, 2008) ***
","I recall disliking the overblown, gimmicky and far too somber HULK (2003); even if the creature’s leaping skills were a staple of the original comic (an animated series of which from the 1960s I used to watch as a kid), I found them especially silly in the live-action version – thankfully, here, they’re relegated to the very end. Anyway, when this was first announced, I had little faith that it would be any good: at first, I even doubted Edward Norton’s suitability for the lead but, seeing him in action as Dr. Bruce Banner, he brings the right elements of intelligence, paranoia, tenacity and anguish to the role (his relationship with Betty Ross – nicely played by the luscious Liv Tyler – is very moving, making for one of the more compelling couples in this type of film).As for the Hulk himself, I’m still reeling from the ultra-fake look of the CGI technique: I know having a body-builder painted green (like Lou Ferrigno was in the popular TV series from the 1970s I’m also familiar with) wouldn’t cut the mustard in this day and age of blockbuster movies filled with large-scale gratuitous mayhem…but when the alternative is so unsatisfactory?! Incidentally, it was nice of the film-makers to acknowledge both actors from that earlier incarnation: the late Bill Bixby (the original Bruce…er…David Banner) appears in a bit from one of his other TV series on Brazilian TV(!), while Ferrigno is the lab guard whom Norton bribes with a pizza(!)…not to mention the character’s creator, Stan Lee (he has become a staple of these modern renditions of his work), who’s the old man infected with Banner’s blood at one point.Another definite strong point to the film is the performance by Tim Roth: his typically riveting intensity makes up for the deficiencies of the character as written – so that he’s believable nevertheless as both a man of action and one who’s curious about the possibilities of science (as always, both the experts in the field and the military callously want to use the techniques to their own selfish ends rather than in the service of humanity); even more importantly, he’s an ideal adversary for both Banner and Hulk (when he’s himself transformed into the so-called Abomination). On the other hand, William Hurt disappointingly (I should say, lazily) hams it up in his one-dimensional role of the cigar-chomping General – one can’t help smiling at his apparent ability to summon all the heavy artillery employed in the pursuit of The Hulk at the bat of an eyelid!; having come to his senses by the end, he is seen taking a drink at a bar when he receives a visit from one Tony Stark… The action is the slam-bang, give-‘em-all-you-‘ve-got routine we’ve come to expect in this form of mass entertainment – which, after a while, begins to look all the same (especially in the way Hulk seems to be impervious to practically anything they can throw at him!); besides, Abomination seems to throw in the towel all-too-easily during their showdown (I guess being a monster in love gave The Hulk greater motivation). Since romance in the usual sense isn’t possible because Banner’s accelerated heartbeat would constitute another transformation into the green giant, we get a bit of King Kong tenderness between Tyler and The Hulk himself in a cave but which, thankfully, isn’t carried on too far.I’d never heard of French director Leterrier: looking at his brief resume' on IMDb, it seems he was chosen for this on the strength of his work on the actioner TRANSPORTER 2 (2005)! – he does seem to have an annoying preponderance for sweeping “helicopter” (crane/overhead) shots. In any case, his next film, looks like it’ll be another remake – this time of the Ray Harryhausen mythological opus CLASH OF THE TITANS (1981) which, for what it’s worth, had featured extensive shooting in Malta!!",7,2,3,6 July 2008
Mission: Impossible III," Mission: Impossible III (J.J. Abrahams, 2006) ***
","It's rare that the third entry in an action-oriented series turn out to be superior to the earlier films, particularly when these had been helmed by people of the caliber of Brian De Palma and John Woo - but it's certainly the case here! One would have thought that the introduction of a wife (well played by Michelle Monaghan) for the Tom Cruise character would have interfered with the action, but the latter never lets up - featuring multiple elaborately staged and exciting set-pieces, including a kidnapping in the Vatican! - and the former gives the film an undeniable edge (and heart) it wouldn't have had otherwise!! Besides, the team which aids Cruise (Ving Rhames, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Maggie Q and Simon Pegg) is more interesting than usual for this type of film...which also goes for the villain as incarnated by Philip Seymour Hoffman, surely among the more formidable in recent memory and easily blowing most Bond villains out of the water!",7,0,2,18 August 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN (Paul McGuigan, 2006) ***
","First off, I have to confess that if my Bank Manager hadn't lent it to me, most probably I would never have watched this one  given my aversion to both Josh Hartnett and Bruce Willis! However, I was pleasantly surprised  as much by the film itself as by Hartnett's wholly agreeable contribution (though Willis was as stolid as ever): this is a violent yet tongue-in-cheek gangster thriller in the Tarantino vein with a similarly convoluted, clever and witty script filled with genre references and, more specifically, features three actors who had previously appeared in his films (Willis, Lucy Liu and an uncredited Robert Forster). Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley play mobster enemies and Stanley Tucci a cop  all three share a guilty past which connects them to both Hartnett and Willis who, for plot purposes, act like they're complete strangers while pitting one gang against the other YOJIMBO (1961)-style. McGuigan's direction is predictably heavy on flashbacks, jump-cuts and other disorienting narrative techniques  all of which used to be a monopoly of Alain Resnais in the 1960s, but is now the stuff of every other self-respecting thriller in this post-Tarantino age of film-making!",7,3,6,17 February 2007
Captain Phillips," CAPTAIN PHILLIPS (Paul Greengrass, 2013) **1/2
","Nominated for 6 Academy Awards in the upcoming Oscar ceremony (Film, Supporting Actor, Adapted Screenplay, Editing, Sound Editing and Sound Mixing), the based-on-fact hijack drama CAPTAIN PHILLIPS somewhat surprisingly missed out on Best Actor (some critics claimed this was double Oscar winner Tom Hanks' best-ever performance) and Best Direction (Greengrass is credited with inventing a new style of kinetic thriller with his BOURNE movies). Although I have watched – and suffered through – both PHILADELPHIA (1993) and FORREST GUMP (1994) in the past, I have yet to watch the director's previous Oscar nod, the similarly-sourced- and-themed UNITED 93 (2006) or, for that matter, any of the reinvented Ludlums.Whenever I read in the news of an international ship being overtaken by African pirates, I could not help thinking that anyone who unwisely ventures into such all-too-obviously dangerous waters deserves whatever fate he encounters. Watching this movie only reinforced that notion – although, to be sure, Hanks is shown doing his utmost to ditch his pursuers and, once they successfully board his vessel, trick them; thankfully, we are also spared any teary-eyed flashbacks to Hanks' domestic life on land when he is individually kidnapped and beaten up.Admittedly, the film is both gripping (the initial game of cat-and-mouse between the hiding crew and the advancing Somali pirates) and moving (when Hanks breaks down after being saved by the Navy Seals); however, apart from being overlong at 134 minutes, my enthusiasm for the partly- shot-in-Malta CAPTAIN PHILLIPS (Hanks was constantly 'tweeting' about his stay over here last Summer) was decidedly marred by two of the most obnoxious villains in screen history (including Oscar nominee Barkhad Abdi – whose role seems to run out of steam in the film's latter stages anyway and, incidentally, his constant referral to Hanks as 'Irish' is just unbelievableas I doubt anyone in Somalia has ever even heard of the country!) who are not only unattractive to look at (if that sounds racist, sue me!) but their constantly hysterical and (no doubt, for veracity's sake) unsubtitled declamations got on my nerves long before the fadeout!",6,0,1,25 February 2014
Marie Antoinette," MARIE ANTOINETTE (Sofia Coppola, 2006) **
","Sofia Coppola, while evidently in possession of some directorial talent she inherited from her seemingly washed-out father Francis, has managed the unenviable feat of making progressively less interesting movies. Her latest venture was, in hindsight, unsurprisingly booed at its Cannes opening as, despite all the visual sumptuousness a lavish budget can afford – including Oscar-winning costume design and great locations – her film is a tedious misfire by the end of it. An eclectic, rather bizarre cast – including Rip Torn (as a lecherous Louis XV), Asia Argento (as his concubine, Madame Dubarry), Judy Davis (as a doting Countess), Danny Huston (as Marie Antoinette’s brother) and even Marianne Faithful (as her mother) – cannot fail to provide moments of interest but the young leads (Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman) are vacuous bores; I have watched the all-star 1938 Hollywood version only once but I don’t recall Marie Antoinette being the brainless pleasure-seeker pining for an heir she is depicted here. For what it’s worth, the utilization of a contemporary rock soundtrack took me by surprise at first but, when one gets used to it, works surprisingly well.",5,1,1,10 July 2007
Kung Fu Panda," KUNG FU PANDA (Mark Osbourne and John Stevenson, 2008) ***
","After an innovative and likable start, the SHREK series quickly deteriorated and, being a similar product, I didn’t quite know how I was going to react to this one – which is basically TMNT via SHREK and STAR WARS (with Oogway standing in for Yoda, Shifu as a cross between Obi-Wan-Kenobi and Master Splinter, Tai Lung replacing Darth Vader and Po, obviously, as an amalgam of both Luke Skywalker and Shrek!).Surprisingly, I ended up enjoying it quite a bit because, not only was the animation technique on display thoroughly “awesome” (though the very best sequence may well be the classically animated opening dream sequence!), but the characterizations themselves (particularly Jack Black’s titular bout) were vividly realized. Apart from Black, Angelina Jolie and Dustin Hoffman, I didn’t recognize the other voice artists and, realizing that the characters of Tai Lung, Monkey and Viper had actually been voiced by Ian McShane, Jackie Chan and Lucy Liu respectively only brought to mind another pet peeve of mine which has become increasingly common in contemporary movies: the credits are bundled together at the very end while the opening is reserved to an endless succession of production company logos (although, in this case, the transformed animated Asian-inflected Dreamworks logo was an inspired and amusing touch)! The moral of the story – that one should not refrain from chasing his life’s dreams in spite of the everyday adversities and that within everyone is the will to achieve this goal – sets the scene for an epic framework of good-vs.-evil in ancient Asia. Thankfully, in spite of the expected spectacle of various action sequences, we were spared anachronistic, in-jokey references to popular movies like THE MATRIX (1999), CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON (2000) and the KILL BILL saga (2003-4). The only disappointment is the rather thin, by-the-numbers plot line – for all his strength and ferocity, one would have expected Tai Lung to summon an army to make his bid for the Dragon Warrior title and end with a veritable battle (rather than turn up alone and, after defeating the previously unassailable Furious Five with relative ease, confront his former mentor/surrogate father and engage in single combat with Po – which he then, obviously, loses)!",7,1,2,6 July 2008
Gravity," GRAVITY (Alfonso Cuaron, 2013) **1/2
","I really cannot understand the gushing reviews this has been getting and the accolades being constantly bestowed upon it: there is really nothing outstanding, or even new, about it – period! Much has been said about its excellent visual effects – but the same is true of countless other sci-fi efforts, so, no big deal there! Similarly, it was acclaimed as a tension-filled two-parter set against a forbidding backdrop: well, this type of film has been done – and much more engagingly, if you ask me – for years...take John Boorman's HELL IN THE PACIFIC (1968), for one! As space operas go, then, its unabashed references to the likes of PLANET OF THE APES, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (both 1968) and ALIEN (1979) only serve to expose its essential dramatic (and artistic) shallowness – enough said! And, frankly, the decision to cast stars (annoying Sandra Bullock and narcissistic George Clooney – yeah right, I totally buy them as astronautswhich goes to show that very little has changed from the practices redolent during the old studio system, where they used to cast Caucasian actors as all sorts of ethnic types) in what clearly amounts to character roles is ample proof that the producers themselves did not have enough faith that the premise would sell itself! Thankfully, the intrinsic streamlining also extends to the film's running-time, so we do not get any tear-jerking flashbacks to Bullock's tragic past on Earth; even so, her assumption that she does not know how to pray is as clichéd as they come! Anyway, the narrative is taken up by scientific jargon (which we have all been suffering from these last 50 years or so), panic attacks (contact with Base is invariably lost early on: incidentally, Ed Harris has been typecast as the voice of Houston ever since APOLLO 13 {1995}!), floating all too easily between various space stations (most of them conveniently unworkable – being peopled by corpses, boasting non-English friendly equipment, oddly self-combustible or simply meteorite targets)! As for its visually arresting 'silent' sequences of the extensive shuttle damage, again, this is no novelty (Michelangelo Antonioni did something similar a good 45 years ago with ZABRISKIE POINT!) and, in any case, it eventually wears thin with the repetition! And is it not a downright cheat to have Bullock fantasize about Clooney 'bailing her out' when all hope seemed lost (by the way, his lengthy conversations with the heroine in an attempt to reassure and guide her, while he is himself headed for certain death, come off as comical more than anything else)?! One might argue that I have said very little in the movie's favour to justify even its 'average' rating: this alone speaks volumes about the way modern cinema generally leaves me cold – with very few titles made in the recent past that I deem worthy of more than a cursory glance...!",5,9,17,21 February 2014
I'm Not There," I'M NOT THERE (Todd Haynes, 2007) **1/2
","To begin with, I've been a longtime fan of Bob Dylan's music; I know of the various phases his career took, but still can't consider myself an expert on him  in fact, I haven't watched any of the documentaries about the elusive musician (despite owning DON'T LOOK BACK [1967] on VHS for some time) but did get to see him in three feature films, namely PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID (1973), the concert movie THE LAST WALTZ (1978) and MASKED AND ANONYMOUS (2003).I was aware of the acclaim garnered by Haynes' fantasia on Dylan's many 'lives' but I have to say I was left disappointed; it's not that I expected the film to be clear-cut or comprehensive (after all, the protagonist is played by six different people!) but, at the end of the day, despite its over-generous length (135 minutes), one has come no closer to understanding the man than he was before  which renders the whole enterprise not only pompous but pointless! Besides, I don't think the film benefited from renaming each personality  we're not talking about David Bowie here!  or, for that matter, some of the milieux in which they 'operated': why make him a movie star, for instance, and what about the black kid or the Western outlaw figure (how was one supposed to connect one with the other unless he knew beforehand they were supposed to be all different facets of the same man)?! Needless to say, the music is outstanding but, frankly, there's hardly an indication of the impact Dylan's music has had over the years (apart from his early crusading folk period); okay, so the crossover to Electric was initially controversial but it subsequently changed the face of rock music foreverand, yet, Haynes seems to take all of this for granted! Another thing that doesn't work is the decision not to give each personality its own space but rather throw them all into the mix without rhyme or reason; it's a pity, then, that Haynes seems to be catering here merely to the staunchest Dylan connoisseur! By the way, the acting is variable: Cate Blanchett's much-touted Oscar-nominated performance is good albeit overly mannered, though only Christian Bale (who gets to play two separate incarnations of Dylan) approximates the musician's famously nasal voice; Heath Ledger is typically brooding, but he's matched in his scenes by Charlotte Gainsbourg as the Sara Dylan figure; if anything, Richard Gere is ideally cast as 'Billy The Kid'  but, apart from the undeniable flavor his scenes give the film, they're the most obscure in the whole scheme of things (I do like Roger Ebert's thesis, however, that what was intended here was an allegory about Dylan's perennial search for his true selfor something like that).Still, perhaps the film's biggest fault is that it's too often a bore  surely, Dylan's real life must have been a lot more compelling than what's depicted/imagined here",6,4,5,3 September 2008
Iron Man 2," IRON MAN 2 (Jon Favreau, 2010) **1/2
","The original entry in this Marvel Comics-derived superhero franchise was one of the best and most enjoyable among the myriad such adaptations to have emerged in recent years. Consequently, I had great expectations for its follow-up (especially since this was afforded a considerably bigger budget) but, while certainly not a bad film per se, it proved by and large a disappointment!To be fair to it, the jaded nature of the whole was actually inherent in the plot – but sometimes it was still taken too far: for instance, Robert Downey Jr.'s alcohol-fueled dance to the disco-beat in full 'Iron Man' attire; similarly, why on Earth would a Scientific Expo necessitate the speaker (in this case, geeky Sam Rockwell) to arrive on stage to the rhythm of pop music?! And what is up with that anti-climactically brief and unimaginative final confrontation between heroes and villain? Other aspects of the storyline, then, were unconvincing (Mickey Rourke's technological prowess or, for that matter, Don Cheadle's – who is able to take on the guise of 'Iron Man 2' {sic} at the bat of an eye-lid!), messy (all of the hero's various complexes – personal, physical and emotional) or otherwise drew unwarranted attention to themselves (Scarlett Johansson's apparently effortless expertise at aerial martial-arts – which, ever since THE MATRIX series, has come to be a prerequisite of action movies). Besides, while I know Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury subplot, which here overlaps into the main narrative rather than being relegated to the after-credits sequence – incidentally, a good part of the audience stayed behind for it this time around! – is intended as a transition between the various superhero flicks already released or else are in the pipeline, I cannot help feeling it stretched out the proceedings unnecessarily!As for the rest, it was pretty much par for the course: a plethora of effects-laden mayhem (at their best during the Monaco Grand Prix, where the grudge-bearing and electricity-charged whip-wielding Rourke first confronts Tony Stark/'Iron Man'; the one-on-one between Downey Jr. and Cheadle at the former's mansion; and the climax in which they combat an army of similar robots – which the power-hungry Rockwell has built – as well as the 'geared-up' Rourke himself) and cynical wisecracks (with the hero lashing self-destructively as much at overbearing authority figures as his own most intimate collaborators, including a returning Gwyneth Paltrow).In the end, my lukewarm reaction to the film has not dulled my interest in an eventual second sequel as such: after all, the third SPIDER-MAN and fourth X-MEN entries in each respective franchise were, likewise, definite come-downs from their predecessors",6,0,2,20 May 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (Gore Verbinski, 2006) **1/2
","I have to say upfront that I wasn't particularly impressed by the original and was very surprised that Johnny Depp's overrated performance ended up among the Best Actor Oscar nominees. This sequel proves to be an even less attractive commodity: the epitome of the empty-headed and over-produced summer blockbuster, the film is tiresomely long while providing nothing that's remotely new, very little plot (with the much-sought titular object coming to little purpose!) and an over-abundance of effects (there are about four separate attacks by The Kraken alone!) to make up for its lazy scripting.While the original was supposed to evoke the Saturday matinée' adventure films of old, this one has little real feeling for the genre; the accent is on the supernatural (what this has to do with a pirate film in the first place is baffling to say the least, and doesn't work quite as much as the film-makers seem to think either!) which allows the make-up department a free hand to create the silliest-looking creatures this side of the 'Star Wars' saga! The stars seem to be merely going through the paces this time around: Johnny Depp overdoes the roguish charm (again!), while Orlando Bloom is as bland as ever; Keira Knightley, after her star-making turn in the original, is under-used here (as if the film-makers didn't quite know what more to do with her!). As for the 'ghosts', we have a ridiculously-tentacled main villain played by the little-known Bill Nighy (who had previously appeared in another saga which vulgarized a myth {or two}, the 'Underworld' films) and Stellan Skarsgard (making little impression) as Bloom's 'undead' pirate father.The film ends on a cliffhanger on the lines of the first entry in 'The Lord Of The Rings' saga and also features an uncredited bit by Geoffrey Rush (turning up at the end to reprise his role from the first installment in the series, whose third episode is already being filmed...which means that we have to suffer through another Summer of this). Mind you, the film is entertaining enough in a mindless {sic} sort of way, but it's all overkill in the end...and, really, the creators of this franchise ought to think more of their audiences rather than merely thinking of how to fill their own pockets (this film's phenomenal box-office performance is preposterous)!!",6,1,4,18 August 2006
Stripes," STRIPES {Extended Version} (Ivan Reitman, 1981) **1/2
","Having spent my childhood in the 1980s, I am somewhat partial to films from that era; with this in mind, I like to re-acquaint myself with popular titles of that vintageor, conversely, catch up with ones I missed out on (for instance, I recently enjoyed that Thanksgiving 'classic' PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES [1987]) – even at this distance. This military comedy, then, falls in the latter category: unfortunately, it is not among the better comedies to have emerged during this time. As indicated, I watched the extended edition of the film which, at 123 minutes, is grossly overlong for this type of fare – even if the added footage (about 16 minutes' worth) is not merely filler material. Also, it deals with a milieu which had been treaded all-too-frequently over the years – which makes the whole exercise somewhat predictable, tiresome and downright pointless! Besides, I have never warmed to Bill Murray's arrogant, narcissistic and self-satisfied personality; the supporting cast includes other exponents of '80s comedies – namely Harold Ramis (serving also as co-writer and who would re-unite with Murray and director Reitman for the GHOSTBUSTERS movies), John Candy and Judge Reinhold (from the POLICE ACADEMY series). Somewhat surprisingly, Warren Oates takes on the predictably tough role of the D.I. – who, naturally, engages in a battle-of-wills with the rebellious Murray and even has to contend with an incompetent superior of his own. Again, it comes as no surprise at all that Murray (and Ramis) become involved with a couple of girls (HALLOWEEN's P.J. Soles and a pre-stardom Sean Young respectively). The last third of the film resolves itself into an elaborate action sequence as the two couples, who had decided to take a holiday in Germany driving a bullet-proof van armed with missiles (the army's latest secret weapon), find themselves having to rescue the rest of their unit who had gone after them and have ended up incarcerated in Communist Czechoslovakia! Mind you, the film is watchable enough for what it is – even if one could hardly call it memorable or even hilarious – but the various elements do not really jell together.",5,0,0,24 January 2010
The Babadook," THE BABADOOK (Jennifer Kent, 2014) ***
","Although I was vaguely aware of the film under review being 'the new phenomenon' in horror movies, it had slipped my mind to try and score a copy for my month-long Halloween marathon which I have just gone through. In fact, it was the recommendation of a local film-buff friend of mine which jogged my memory and made me spring for it sooner rather than later. As usual, in hindsight, the end result fell just short of all the hype that had preceded it – but, having said that, it is still the best horror film I have watched since James Wan's surprise box-office smash, THE CONJURING (2013). Being a contemporary low-budget Australian production, it is small wonder than none of its cast and crew ring a bell but, as it turns out, as had previously been the case with legendary genre stalwarts like George Lucas and John Carpenter, writer/director Kent's breakout film turns out to be an expansion of a previous work, in this case the award-winning short MONSTER (2005; which, incidentally, is generously available to view in its entirety on 'You Tube')!The simple storyline revolves around a widowed care-worker and her disturbed young son being menaced by the eponymous villain of a children's book. The film is anchored by two exceptional lead performances from Essie Davis (as the beleaguered mother) and Noah Wiseman (as her volatile kid), sensitive and subtle handling and a creepily effective sound design. Surprisingly enough, the titular villain (played by Tim Purcell mostly in silhouette) barely features in it – which makes its belated and sparse apparitions all the more electrifying. Unfortunately, the director still felt the need to cater (ever so slightly) for the 'torture porn' crowd and gore-hounds in the audience by, at one point, showing the possessed mother plucking out a tooth from her own mouth (for no apparent reason!) – thus virtually stifling the effect of the preceding scene (one of the best in the film) where she breaks the neck of her fluffy dog during a late-night TV screening of the original Italian-language version of Mario Bava's BLACK SABBATH (1963)! – as well as exorcising herself of the offending spirit (which, inexplicably, she later keeps chained in the basement!) following a bout of bloody vomiting!!Like most horror films of recent vintage (particularly the good ones), as it was unfolding in front of me, I was reminded of several earlier genre efforts to which the film-makers could well be paying tribute or referencing, the most prominent of which here being Roman Polanski's REPULSION (1965; in its harrowing depiction of the psychological unraveling of its sex-starved female protagonist), William Friedkin's THE EXORCIST (1973; in the medical examination and possession sequences), Mario Bava's own swan-song SHOCK (1977; in the fractured mother-son relationship played out in a house haunted by the malevolent presence of their late husband-father) and the Tobe Hooper/Steven Spielberg blockbuster POLTERGEIST (1982; in the climactic aerial abduction attempt by the spirit on the boy – who had been constantly coming up with elaborate weapons to combat it). The trump card of this particular film, it seems to me, is the fact that all the supernatural horror on display emanates from an obscure literary figure that finds itself in the house out of nowhere, puts itself back together after the mother tears the inventively illustrated book up and even rewrites itself anew in a more personalized and intimidating manner as a consequence of this very defiance!",7,4,18,3 November 2014
The Other Boleyn Girl," THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL (Justin Chadwick, 2008) ***
","Having studied European History in Secondary School, I've always been fascinated by the reign of England's King Henry VIII  a period less noted for chivalrous deeds than bed-hopping antics, as he married no less than six times in order to secure a male heir to the throne (even if this caused a rift between the country and the Roman Catholic Church which endures to this very day). Unsurprisingly, all of this has made him ideal film material  personally, I've watched THE PRIVATE LIFE OF HENRY VIII (1933), THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER (1937), THE SWORD AND THE ROSE (1953), YOUNG BESS (1953), A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS (both 1966 big-screen and 1988 TV versions), ANNE OF A THOUSAND DAYS (1969) and, of course, CARRY ON HENRY (1971); I recently acquired HENRY VIII AND HIS SIX WIVES (1972), which was adapted from a much longer TV series, but have yet to check it out.This, then, gives a 'novel' twist to the most turbulent period in Henry's life and reign  as we discover that, before making Anne Boleyn his Queen (whose offspring was Elizabeth I), he had been involved with her younger sister (who had actually borne him a son)!; incidentally, these events  based on a novel by Philippa Gregory  had already been adapted for the small screen in 2003but someone thought that this little-known romance was intriguing enough to make it into a feature film. As it stands, THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL is a sumptuous-looking production  despite being mostly restricted to interiors, and where the color scheme is actually quite subtle; for this reason, much depends on the acting  and the three leads (Natalie Portman as Anne, Scarlett Johannson as the titular figure and Eric Bana as Henry) are all given the opportunity to shine, thus overcoming their basic youthfulness for the roles. Two other notables in the cast are Kristin Scott-Thomas as the two Boleyn sisters' mother and Ana Torrent (still best-known for playing the little girl in THE SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE [1973]) as the barren and jealous Queen Katharine.Even so, the plot (which, reportedly, doesn't play fair with history) defies credibility at times and tends too often towards melodrama. For one thing, Henry is depicted as something of a pawn in the machinations of an over-ambitious family; he's also gullible (it's Anne who pushes him into breaking with Rome!) and, least convincingly of all, is the fact that everything seems to happen simply because she refuses to sleep with the King before he makes her Queen (which then leads to a potentially campy scene in which Henry rapes Anne)! The less said, then, of the Queen's attempt to entice her fey brother into impregnating her (soon after she loses Henry's second child)  and how this is what ultimately led to Anne's execution!  the better; incidentally, the film rather rushes through her tenure as sovereign (despite the title, she's the real protagonist)  while the pivotal character of Sir Thomas More (the subject of A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS) doesn't figure at all in Church-rupture affair! That said, such narrative shortcomings don't really impinge on one's enjoyment of the film  hence the respectable rating accorded it.At the end of the day, THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL won't dispel memories of the better cinematic versions of Henry VIII's reign and (some of his) loves  but it's nonetheless valuable as much for shedding light on an episode which had previously been all but overlooked as for its atypically frank detail of life at court.",7,0,0,3 September 2008
The Fifth Element," THE FIFTH ELEMENT (Luc Besson, 1997) **1/2
","While I had missed out on this on initial release and various TV airings over the years, it now ended up being my second BluRay viewing! It was Bruce Willis' second of 3 sci-fi epics made in the space of as many years â€“ the others being the superior TWELVE MONKEYS (1995) and the even lesser Armageddon (1998). Luc Besson often dabbled in fantasy and, though re-united with Gary Oldman from LEON (1994), this proved the French director's first real brush with Hollywood.The film is redolent of two earlier genre landmarks, namely STAR WARS (1977; in its plethora of monstrous characters) and BLADE RUNNER (1982; the 'chaotic' look); plot-wise, it owes a bit to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (1981) given the danger-fraught odyssey relating to an archaeological find. Casting, too, channels famous (musical/film) personalities with Oldman's campy villain evoking David Bowie, while Chris Tucker's outrageous but irrelevant TV show host brings to mind Prince!; in a similar key, actors from earlier classic sci-fi titles have been recruited: Ian Holm from ALIEN (1979), Brion James from BLADE RUNNER itself and John Neville who, though best-known for THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN (1989), was also the lead of the low-budgeted but superb UNEARTHLY STRANGER (1963).As expected, the film looks great (showcasing imaginative production/costume design and special effects) and, while the central theme is interesting (if hardly original), the ending is a disappointment: Oldman is dispatched before the climax and by his own volatile 'thugs' to boot, whereas a super alien promising a showdown with the Forces of Good is conveniently dealt with by the ray of light unleashed when the mythic five elements come together in Egypt (some form of direct confrontation would not have been amiss at this point)! Incidentally, the ruse of forcing Willis (here sporting blond hair) to admit his love for heroine Milla Jovovich obviously rips-off the finale of Howard Hawks' RIO BRAVO (1959) â€“ just as the couple's lovemaking being interrupted by suddenly adulating authority figures smacks of the James Bond movies! By the way, Besson would probably be deemed a visionary now, not so much for his futuristic films, but for daring to make the American President a black man (though DEEP IMPACT {1998} soon after employed the very same device)! The film, then, is action-packed, thus reasonably entertaining, but it also contains a number of flaws â€“ mainly Tucker's embarrassing and overbearing character and the supreme silliness of having an alien for a singing operatic diva (actually, the whole over-the-top section on the flying cruise-liner was a mistake)! On the other hand, Jovovich and Oldman (helped in no small measure by their respectively sparse and gaudy attire) are a delight throughout and the main reason for watching this...",6,1,2,5 August 2011
Brokeback Mountain," Brokeback Mountain (Ang Lee, 2005) ***
","I had a chance to watch this highly-acclaimed, award-winning film on the big screen while I was in Hollywood at the beginning of the year but, put off by the subject matter, I resisted doing so - until now. Well, while essentially a good film, I'll certainly join the chorus of those who consider it quite overrated! It's definitely not the first (or most significant) gay-themed American film, mainstream or otherwise - and, vis-à-vis my recent viewing of Nagisa Oshima's samurai picture, GOHATTO (1999), it's hardly the first to put this kind of spin on popular film genres either! Anyway, the two men's relationship comes out of nowhere really (boredom and the extreme cold of the mountains, maybe?), especially since both state that they're not 'queer'; besides, there's no attempt at an explanation of why it should have lasted two decades! This lack of conviction, therefore, coupled with the slow pace results in a deadly first half…but the film improves somewhat with its depiction of the two characters' drab family life.The third and least interesting major 'cowboy' film from Larry McMurtry (the others being HUD [1963] and THE LAST PICTURE SHOW [1971]), it's well-acted by an ensemble cast - even if Heath Ledger lays on the mumbling James Dean persona a bit too thick! In the end, Ang Lee's surprising choice as director eventually emerges a sound one, as he gives the film a welcome arty feel; another major asset is the melancholy score.",6,2,30,5 May 2006
My Neighbor Totoro," MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO (Hayao Miyazaki, 1988) ***
","This is my fourth film from this celebrated animation artist; while I've always enjoyed his work, I still feel that it's somewhat overrated. The ones I'd watched - PRINCESS MONONOKE (1997), SPIRITED AWAY (2001; his best, in my opinion) and HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE (2004) - were all plot-packed, overwhelming visual experiences, so I was surprised to find this one much simpler, virtually kiddie-oriented and essentially plot less! It was still meticulously detailed and inventive, with two extremely likable female protagonists and equally delightful anthropomorphic characters - not to mention an infectious title track. I've yet to catch up with quite a number of his films (TCM showed a retrospective of his work while I was in Hollywood late last year, but I didn't have the time - or stamina - for them) but, given their basic similarity, I guess it's best to approach them one at a time (my local DVD rental outlet does carry a few more titles, though)...",7,0,8,10 November 2006
Juno," JUNO (Jason Reitman, 2007) **1/2
","This film is a classic example of just how out-of-touch with modern cinema I find myself these days: while most critics seemed to fall over backwards in praising its simple qualities (a prerogative of so-called “Indie” film-making, and which here has more to do with a certain freshness of approach and the insight it gives into the problems effecting today’s youth than for any intrinsic artistic merit), I wasn’t sufficiently engaged in any of it to be more than slightly bemused by the plight of our spunky heroine. If anything, I was more concerned with the fact that a 16 year-old girl – and in her condition to boot – is allowed to drive a bulky motor vehicle! Still, though about (and presumably aimed at) kids going through Juno’s same predicament i.e. the unforeseen repercussions of becoming “sexually active” at a tender age, the Oscar-winning script (by an ex-stripper!) is rather too smart for its own good: are we to honestly believe that girls so young could ever be into vintage Punk music and Euro-Horror films? Besides, it’s too often overwritten (being somewhat obsessed with product placement) – thus making the would-be authentic dialogue feel more than a bit awkward at times. The film, at least, is short enough at 96 minutes not to overstay its welcome…even if, in the long run, it’s mainly tolerable for Ellen Page’s genuinely disarming Oscar-nominated lead performance.The other female characters that feature in the narrative tend to be outspoken (Juno’s stepmom), bossy (the intended adoptive mother for Page’s child played by Jennifer Garner) or kooky (the protagonist’s best friend). In this respect, our heroine’s symbiosis with Garner’s failed rocker husband Jason Bateman (from TEEN WOLF TOO [1987]!!) was a nice touch – though Juno’s own continuing relationship with the geeky boy who impregnated her isn’t exactly interesting or even credible. Finally, the whole is so obviously the work of an inexperienced director: in fact, he relies way too heavily on pop/rock tunes (via an admittedly eclectic, if occasionally bizarre, line-up) to expound on the characters’ feelings throughout – which, then, has the unfortunate effect of diluting whatever comment was intended to be made in the first place! Indeed, why do today’s film-makers keep shoving their musical tastes in our faces – especially when, as in this case, he (or any of his main characters) wasn’t even around when some of that music (for instance, The Velvet Underground’s “I’m Sticking With You”) was originally released?",6,1,5,16 September 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End (Gore Verbinski, 2007) **1/2
","When I reviewed PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN’S CHEST (2006), I had complained that the producers forsook plot for sheer bombast. They seem to have made up for this by swamping us this time around with a variety of plot threads, none of which is remotely interesting, but the result is an inflated running-time of almost 3 hours! The multiple clashes, double-crosses, schemes, incarcerations – to say nothing of the myriad factions (and monsters) involved – necessitate an excessive amount of exposition, which I could feel made the audience I saw it with quite restless! Besides, its incongruous smattering of intellectual elements – multiple Johnny Depps, Stellan Skarskard’s repeated greeting – must have gone over the heads of most of its intended audience!! Still, I think that the lengthy surrealist sequence which belatedly introduces the Jack Sparrow character here is a very surprising highlight for a blockbuster film in this day and age.Even so, Depp and Orlando Bloom merely sleepwalk through their roles – but the film does make better use of Keira Knightley this time around. There‘s also the welcome (if hammy) return of Geoffrey Rush, while Chow-Yun-Fat’s Asian pirate gang adds a nice exotic touch (if little else). The repellent special effects aren’t as prominent as in the previous entry – but the black witch’s role (whose dialogue is largely unintelligible) is regrettably elevated to a major supporting one! The best moment is probably the 360-degree turn the ship makes, and the original wedding ceremony its most inventive bit. Overall, the film results in being more enjoyable than DEAD MAN’S CHEST – but the formula is clearly over-baked and, therefore, unpalatable in the long run…",6,2,6,6 June 2007
Spider-Man 3," SPIDER-MAN 3 (Sam Raimi, 2007) ***
","I loved the first film (which I watched twice in theaters) but recall that the second installment was rather less enjoyable; this seems to me to be slightly superior to its predecessor. Unfortunately, however, the action set-pieces are too dizzyingly-edited to be properly evaluated; still, the high-rise stunt early on and the climactic battle of the mutants are undeniably spectacular.Besides, the complicated plot results in gross overlength - featuring yet another round of the Tobey Macguire/Kirsten Dunst/James Franco love triangle, too many adversaries for Spider-man (with allegiances shifting frequently and unconvincingly), and a baffling insistence on the deaths of the Willem Dafoe and Cliff Robertson characters from the first film! A platinum blonde Bryce Dallas Howard brings some much-needed freshness to the proceedings - though her role, ultimately, proves of little consequence.The Sandman's back-story is especially ludicrous and sentimental with an utterly wasted Theresa Russell as his resentful wife; Venom, however, is interesting (especially in the way he represents Spider-man's alter ego) - but comes to the fore far too late into the game: his demise is nicely handled, too, but it's then ruined by the apparent necessity to eliminate the Topher Grace character. The scenes involving the 'Evil Peter Parker' swagger, then, are eye-rollingly embarrassing, as is the musical number sung by Dunst during her disastrous Broadway stint! The film allows Bruce Campbell yet another delightful cameo, and there's even a wonderful bit involving Spider-man co-creator Stan Lee. In the end, SPIDER-MAN 3 succeeds mainly as a slick and solidly entertaining ride (as long as one doesn't analyze it too deeply).",7,7,14,9 May 2007
Match Point," MATCH POINT (Woody Allen, 2005) ***
","I wouldn't say that I'm Woody's biggest fan but, along the years, I've found his writing to be of a consistently high quality. As I was watching this film, I felt guilty of having neglected his recent work - the last Allen title I've watched is SWEET AND LOWDOWN (1999) and, in all, I still have to catch up with 14 of his pictures! - but, by the end of it, I reconfirmed my opinion that his work needs to be taken in small doses...Considering the praise heaped upon MATCH POINT, many claiming it to be some kind of (belated) turning point in Allen's career, I didn't quite know what to expect. However, when I watched the film I was relieved - but, at the same time, disappointed - to discover that it's nothing if not the old Woody all over again! While I wouldn't quite call his films boring, the relentless barrage of cultural name-dropping in historical/fashionable surroundings - more than his Bergmanesque study of male/female relationships and their neuroses (which is not as pronounced here as in some of his earlier, more austere work anyway) - is decidedly exasperating...and, in the case of this particular film, is further augmented by the posh lifestyle of the characters and the dreary London setting. Besides, listening to Allen's distinctive dialogue being delivered with a British accent proved quite unreal and took some getting used to! Anyway, what made the film for me was the presence - in both senses - of Scarlett Johannson: not only is she breath-taking to look at (I was extremely lucky to get to see her, and even attended two Press Conferences she did, at the 2004 Venice Film Festival!) but her tackling of the difficult role - as was the case with LOST IN TRANSLATION (2003) - was outstanding, and knowledgeable beyond her years; I've watched only two of the performances nominated for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar, but I can't help feeling that she has been snubbed (and that's twice already!).As for the much-touted final third which turns the film, unexpectedly, into a thriller (not a first for Woody, by the way): Allen directs these scenes like a pro, even taking care to include elements of black comedy and capping all with a devastatingly ironic ending. Bravo! Well, even if the film is not up to the standards of his best serious work (alas, only the first of them has received more than one viewing from me!) - ANNIE HALL (1977), MANHATTAN (1979), HANNAH AND HER SISTERS (1986), CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS (1989) and HUSBANDS AND WIVES (1992) - writing these comments just now has all of a sudden put me in the mood for more of the director's films: I do have four on VHS (though both my VCRs are currently out-of-order!) but, then, my local DVD outlet carries most of his recent work...",7,0,4,1 May 2006
Midnight in Paris," MIDNIGHT IN Paris (Woody Allen, 2011) ***
","This easily constitutes Allen's best work since MATCH POINT (2005), also signaling a welcome return to the historical/time-travel themes of ZELIG (1983) and THE PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO (1985) respectively. Though it appears that Allen is meeting an increasing dearth of actors to work with (his films are usually peppered with top talent), it is admirable how this essentially modest company still manages to sink its teeth into his typically verbose, neurotic and amazingly informed script! By the way, I was surprised to see a plethora of Spanish companies behind this film – could it be that Allen is no longer a desirable commodity in his own country?! Anyway, here we get Hollywood hack screenwriter Owen Wilson setting his mind on penning The Great American Novel, with Paris (the mecca of the art world in an earlier age) supplying the ideal background to fire up his imagination. However, since he is accompanied by his predictably condescending fiancée' (a rather wasted Rachel McAdams) and her obviously conservative parents, he finds his creativity stifled – especially after she runs into an old friend (Michael Sheen), whose know-it-all attitude irks Wilson no end. So, he goes away by himself on a midnight stroll, wishing he were back in the 1920s (mind you, I harbored a particular kinship with his predicament – since I also believe that I was born too late and, consequently, feel out-of-touch with the current times!)and, lo and behold, an old-fashioned car comes along and whisks him away to rub shoulders with the likes of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso, Cole Porter (whose songs are a constant on the soundtrack), Josephine Baker, Gertrude Stein (played by Kathy Bates), Alice B. Toklas, etc.! Here, he also meets and falls for a woman (Marion Cotillard, who typically walks off with the film) that is actually contended by both Picasso and Hemingway. Since he tries to fit in by presenting himself as an author, Hemingway tells him he will refer a draft of his novel to the matriarchal Stein but, as soon as he exits the bohemian establishment, the premises revert to their current state i.e. a laundry! Of course, McAdams does not believe a word he tells her, so she reluctantly agrees to accompany him the next night – but she quits in contempt before the proverbial 'taxi' arrives, precisely at the stroke of midnight. This time around, Wilson is introduced to Salvador Dali (an impressive and hilarious Adrien Brody, forever re-routing a conversation towards a discussion of rhinoceroses!) and Luis Bunuel: his initial contribution is very understated, as if Allen did not quite know how to use him – however, in a subsequent scene, we get an inspired moment in which Wilson sneakily suggests to the Surrealist master the germ of an idea that the latter would eventually develop into one of his greatest films, THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962)but, naturally, he cannot quite grasp the absurd beauty of the situation presented to him so early into the game! While, at first, I was disappointed that Wilson does not walk in and out of the past at random (Allen opting for a Cinderella-type device), Cotillard herself pines for the so-called 'Belle Epoque' i.e. the 1890s (even if her own era is known as 'L'Age D'Or' – as it happens, the ironic title of one of Bunuel's most scathing efforts!) and, magically, we go back to the dives haunted by such world-renowned painters as Toulouse-Lautrec, Gaugin and Degas! In the end, even if this is more of a nostalgia trip than a dense time/space meditation a' la the films of Alain Resnais (incidentally, Allen had once decried never having made a truly great film!), we are nevertheless treated to a few choice nuggets of pure mystery: Carla Bruni – yes, Mrs. Sarkozy herself! – translating Cotillard's memoirs to Wilson, clearly published long before but where he unaccountably gets mentioned!; and a private detective, appointed by McAdams' father to follow Wilson on his after-hours 'trysts', falling foul of the time-warp himself and turning up – understandably befuddled – in the Middle Ages! Even so, the elaborate structure still allows for character growth, since Wilson ultimately attains serenity within his own epoch and, having broken up with McAdams (who admits to an affair with the insufferable Sheen), hooks up romantically with a new partner (a girl he had, time and again, conversed with at a flea-market and with whom he shares a fondness for Cole Porter) in a downpour – to him, Paris at its most expressive – at the conclusion.",7,1,2,26 December 2011
Zodiac," ZODIAC (David Fincher, 2007) ***
","David Fincher’s fifth feature film takes him back to the territory of his second film and greatest success, SEVEN (1995) – the serial killer theme. Here, however, he concerns himself with a real-life, unsolved case which shocked – and fascinated – America for the best part of 20 years. The film is quite long at 158 minutes, but the intriguing subject matter and the incredibly detailed scrutiny of the case makes for compulsive, if occasionally heavy-going, viewing.The film basically divides itself into three sections – the first part deals with Robert Downey Jr.’s troubled crime reporter (he actually became a target for the killer at one point and eventually self-destructs in a haze of boozing lethargy), the second with the police investigation itself – conducted by Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards – and especially the effects it has on the former’s career (he is eventually taken off the case and transferred to another division for tampering with the evidence) and, finally, cartoonist Jake Gyllenhaal’s obsessive odyssey to decipher, track and eventually meet the Zodiac which takes its toll on his family life and costs him his job at the paper.Overall, the film is of a high quality on a technical level with any number of impressive scenes (the opening murder sequence to the strains of Donovan’s “Hurdy Gurdy Man” is a cracker) and a couple of good performances (particularly Downey’s and Brian Cox’s psychoanalyst) but it does have its undeniable flaws, too: the characters played by Gyllenhaal and Ruffalo come off as unsympathetic when contrasted with Downey’s effortless charisma, there is perhaps too many newspaper conferences and not enough depictions of the murders, there is certainly little or no attempt to identify the cause of Zodiac’s behavior and, after almost three hours and after all those years, the prime suspect is still the same one (although I can’t say I was completely convinced of it myself) despite the occasional, effective red herring (apparently being an old movie buff is a pre-requisite for serial killer suspects). In hindsight, it seems incredible now that it took the various investigating forces 22 years to track down the one surviving victim of the Zodiac killings but, by that time, the prime suspect would go on to die of a heart attack… Finally, one thing I especially liked was that the Zodiac was apparently inspired to commit his crimes by a classic horror movie, THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME (1932) – while his own exploits themselves inspired an iconic piece of cinema, DIRTY HARRY (1971)!",7,1,2,10 July 2007
The Prestige," THE PRESTIGE (Christopher Nolan, 2006) ***1/2
","I've been interested in this period drama about the rivalry between a couple of magicians ever since I first heard about it, promising to be the kind of film they don't make 'em like anymore - it was that, and then some! Still, if there's one criticism I'd level at THE PRESTIGE, it's this: magic there is here but no poetry (the closest it comes is in the scene where the snow is 'lit' up and when Hugh Jackman stumbles upon the transported hats); having just rewatched Georges Franju's JUDEX (1963), I felt this most strongly - what it needed, perhaps, was a more evocative score (a' la Maurice Jarre's haunting theme for that film). Likewise, I somewhat regret the fact that the settings and the detail had to be so realistic - but I can see how this was vital to the psychology (which is, basically, what drives the plot in the first place!).The film shows the essential fun of the craft but also the dedication it requires; the throat-cutting which goes on behind the scenes does seem a little far-fetched, even if propelled by a quest for vengeance (to say nothing of the extremity of the sacrifice to which the two men and those closest to them seem to be willing to go, or are made to, merely to feed their individual unhealthy obsession!) - except that the plot is so absorbing it's only after the film is over that one has time to ponder on such details!! Of course, the multiple revelations during its last act are astounding, if not a little confusing and somewhat too clever for their own good (it's ironical, too, that the two magicians end up 'dying' the same way as their respective spouses - but to reveal more would be unthinkable!): it certainly needs more than a single viewing for all the subtleties to be picked up and, while I'm not usually one to allow most recent films another look, this one is utterly fascinating and enjoyable...so I wouldn't have a problem with that (and, in any case, reading the HTF's 'Official Discussion Thread' on THE PRESTIGE got me thinking about how much of it went over my head!).The casting works better than I had anticipated: both Jackman and Christian Bale are their respective characters and they work off each other beautifully; Michael Caine and David Bowie, then, lend dignity to the proceedings with their knowing and underplayed roles. Still, while the contribution of the three women in their lives (Scarlett Johannson, Rebecca Hall and Piper Perabo) isn't just decorative, only Hall as Bale's long-suffering wife is handed a truly meaty character; in fact, as was the case with THE BLACK DAHLIA (2006), Johannson serves mainly as a device to accentuate the power play being enacted between the two self-destructing male leads - but, then, such high-profile and noteworthy assignments can only increase her own prestige {sic} as an actress...I've loved all of Nolan's films I've watched so far (I'm only left with his debut feature, FOLLOWING [1998], to catch up with) - but I can safely say that this one's the best (or, if you like, my favorite) of the lot.",8,1,4,18 December 2006
Cloverfield," CLOVERFIELD (Matt Reeves, 2008) ***
","To begin with, I found this to be somewhat better than I had anticipated (though, admittedly, advance reviews had been generally positive). That said, the opening fifteen minutes are quite deadly - (even if the extended party footage helps to flesh out characters and, thus, heighten the later relentless anxiety passages). Thankfully, the teen relationships stuff gets forgotten pretty quickly  but, when they occur, the elegiac intermittent video footage of the happier past gives one a much-needed breather.This is THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (1999) meets THE HOST (2006) or, if you, like a Hollywood monster movie of yore updated for the MTV generation and filtered through with a post-9/11 sensibility. SCREAM (1996), THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT itself and SAW (2004) are all recent examples of the next big thing in Horror films; and, yet, who today recalls (or even misses) the film-makers of BLAIR WITCH? The director of this one, Matt Reeves, is already 42  and his previous film had been the comedy THE PALLBEARER (1996); in any case, CLOVERFIELD is more renowned for being a J.J. Abrams project (who produced it).The film is compact (even with its tight 75 minutes duration, barring the typically lengthy closing credits, it stills sags slightly and interest starts to wane towards the end), the title obscure, the monster(s) undefined (the shapeless main creature is creepy and admirably one only gets to have a real good look at it when gobbling up the Hud character! The young cast is variable, anonymous (with the most interesting characters being the misfits  Helena for being a Latina and Hud a geek) and, fashionably, indiscriminately disposed of. As for the cine'-verite' approach, the film-makers' over-reliance on it becomes rather self-defeating: would it be plausible for someone to keep filming this stuff? Besides, while aiding in the immediacy of the destruction and the ensuing panic (with such effective shock sequences as the demolition of the Brooklyn bridge, the tunnel attack and Helena's mysteriously violent and messy death), it never allows the audience a moment for reflection  coming across as a sensation rather than an experience and, given that nothing at all is explained, one isn't any the wiser by the end of it! In retrospect, it seems obvious that the traumatic 9/11 events has transported the U.S. back to the days of political/nuclear/alien paranoia which, back then, was also transmitted into cinematic terms via any number of sci-fi parables but where it's evident that the film-makers of that time were utmost professionals (in their strict majority) whose mission was to provide thought-provoking entertainment rather than merely computer-generated publicity stunts. At least, it does manage a couple of lingering images: the disembodied head of the Statue Of Liberty tumbling to the ground and an empty horse-carriage eerily wandering by night on a practically deserted city street. Sadly enough, but hardly surprising, a sequel is already in the works; the film, then, is no masterpiece but very well done nonetheless: smart, exciting and highly effective  in essence, what the much-hyped Hollywood remake of GODZILLA (1998) should have been in the first place! In spite of my reservations, I still consider it to be the first must-see movie of 2008 (which I chose not to watch it in the theater for fear of the dizzy camera syndrome proving to be a bit much but, actually, one gets used to it pretty quickly).",7,1,3,14 April 2008
Silent Hill," SILENT HILL (Christophe Gans, 2006) **
","Although the fact that this was inspired by a Japanese video game did not sound promising at first, I was sufficiently impressed by the constantly arresting visuals that, in the end, it is a shame that the storyline is so hopelessly muddled and, consequently, all that care and effort was for naught.The story of a mother and her precocious adopted child going back to a ghost town to seek out the roots of their nightmares only to be met by a nightmare of far greater proportions had potential but these are only partially realized by the film-makers: following on from the artistic and commercial success of BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF (2001), director Christophe Gans is let down by an overly ambitious script by Roger Avary, the co-writer of PULP FICTION (1994) which mixes in childhood fantasies, witch-hunting, nightmarish slithering creatures, the emargination of an individual by a bigoted society, identity doubles, the loss of a child and an examination of the disintegration of the family unit. With all of this going on, it is remarkable that a couple of performances - by Radha Mitchell (as the distraught mother) and Laurie Holden (as a police officer on her tracks who gets more than she bargained for) - shine through; Alice Krige, as the community leader, is quite hammy in comparison and the nominal male lead Sean Bean (as Mitchell's husband) barely registers at all - although this can be explained by the fact that his character was hastily added into the script to appease concerned backers who complained of the lack of men in the story! As a matter of fact, the original script was around three-and-a-half hours in length and, although this was not filmed in its entirety, some additional material - even as an extra feature on the DVD - might have helped to make this more coherent. As it is, the ending is particularly head-scratching...",5,0,3,29 October 2006
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street (Tim Burton, 2007) ***
","I knew of the gory exploits of the Demon Barber via the 1936 barnstorming vehicle for British ham extraordinaire Tod Slaughter, though I haven’t watched that particular film itself; on the other hand, I was vaguely aware that Stephen Sondheim had turned it into an unlikely but, by all accounts, successful musical.Tim Burton is a genuine but somewhat erratic talent but, whenever he joins forces with one of today’s finest actors – Johnny Depp – he seems to be particularly inspired, and this one’s no exception. As ever, the film’s visuals (of a seedy and forbidding 19th century London) are impeccable – and SWEENEY TODD deservedly emerged the Oscar winner in the art direction/set decoration category last Sunday night! Interestingly, Depp had never sung on film previously but he does extremely well and, indeed, figured prominently – somewhat surprisingly (this is a horror musical, after all) but rightly so, in my opinion – among the year’s Best Actor nominees; his brooding good looks are perfect for the character’s mix of pent-up emotions and cool viciousness. He’s matched by Helena Bonham-Carter, the director’s own mate, as the pie-shop owner who decides to spice up her traditional recipe – and is delighted to see the formerly dormant business flourish (with the helping hand of revenge-seeking barber Depp)! The supporting cast is headed by reliables such as Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall and newer star acts like BORAT (2006)’s Sacha Baron Cohen as a pompous traveling barber/charlatan (and, hence, a rival/victim for Todd).SWEENEY TODD has been criticized for its vigorous blood-letting, and I do concede that Burton should have restrained his predilection for these grisly scenes – since they tend to become repetitive and, eventually, lead the film towards overlength at almost two hours. A local critic whose opinion I usually respect and value was underwhelmed by the film and only gave it **; he was also unimpressed by the songs or the actors’ idiosyncratic rendition of them; I personally found Sondheim’s score quite effective and rousing at just the right moments…though, admittedly, it could also be grating i.e. whenever the actors have to sing separate choruses on top of one another. Similarly, Mrs. Lovett’s fantasy beach scene comes across as a distraction – as if we’d been suddenly thrown back to the environment of Burton’s own BIG FISH (2003)! The narrative’s overwhelming Gothic bleakness remains unrelieved till the very end – with events leading to the inevitable frenzied climax tinged with a tragic irony; we should perhaps have been allowed a ray of hope by being shown the young lovers united but, since the film is really about the plight of Depp’s character and his luckless wife, it’s appropriate that we stick with their fate.",7,0,3,26 February 2008
Shutter Island," SHUTTER ISLAND (Martin Scorsese, 2010) ***1/2
","Martin Scorsese's fourth consecutive feature film to have Leonardo Di Caprio in the lead is one that I felt was slightly superior to their Oscar-winning predecessor, THE DEPARTED (2006); undoubtedly, it is a vast improvement over Scorsese's previous movie with definite horror overtones i.e. the unsatisfactory and unnecessary remake of CAPE FEAR all the way back from 1991! Having said that, the film is ostensibly a mystery thriller set inside a mental institution and, reportedly, Scorsese drew inspiration from several noirs directed by Jacques Tourneur and his earlier horror output for producer Val Lewton (whose own last effort in that genre, BEDLAM [1946], shared a similar setting to this one). Although Robbie Robertson's brooding assembled score tends to be over-emphatic, this has to be one of Scorsese's most intricately crafted works, replete with suffocatingly gloomy visuals (courtesy of cinematographer Robert Richardson and production designer Dante Ferretti). Leonardo Di Caprio's performance – as a Federal Agent investigating the 'impossible' disappearance of a female inmate – is arguably his most confident yet under Scorsese's mentoring; however, from the outset, his character clearly belongs to the 'nuttier than thou' variety and the much-touted identity twist in the film's latter half did not inordinately surprise this viewer! Without wishing to reveal anything of the labyrinthine mazes in Dennis (MYSTIC RIVER) Lehane's source novel, suffice it to say that the film's plot turns from an imbroglio a' la THE WICKER MAN (1973), by way of elaborate charades akin to THE GAME (1997), into a personality crisis in the A BEAUTIFUL MIND (2003) mould. Aiding Di Caprio in bringing his character's inner turmoil to the surface – and, consequently, appearing to hinder his investigation at every turn – are an impressive array of actors all of whom rise impeccably to the occasion: Ben Kingsley (as Shutter Island's radical head honcho), Max von Sydow (splendidly sinister in the handful of scenes he is featured in), Mark Ruffalo (as Di Caprio's 'partner'), Michelle Williams (as Di Caprio's dead wife!), Emily Mortimer (as the missing patient), Patricia Clarkson, Jackie Earle Haley, John Carroll Lynch, Ted Levine, and Elias Koteas. Apart from Di Caprio's harrowing flashbacks to his part in the liberation of the Dachau Concentration Camp (which, we are led to believe, were the reasons for his later alcoholism and disturbed state of mind), there are effective nightmare sequences aplenty (perhaps a mite more than required, actually) abounding with bloodied corpses or dissolving ghosts. Topping everything up, we have a deliciously enigmatic ending that, again, leaves the door open (ironically enough for a movie set on an island prison) for more than one clear interpretation: did Di Caprio fake a relapse and welcomed lobotomy to pay for his grave, alcohol-induced fault of not committing his mad wife at an earlier stage and thus sparing the lives of his three childrenor, was he the murderer of his entire family all along? Because, were it otherwise, why else would he have been institutionalized in this most forbidding of mental hospitals in the first place?!",8,1,5,20 March 2010
Capote," CAPOTE (Bennett Miller, 2005) ***1/2
","Despite (or perhaps because of) its low-key nature, this emerges as a better film than either CRASH (2004) or BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN (2005). Its success, clearly, is due mainly to Philip Seymour Hoffman's uncanny portrayal that deservedly won him several accolades (chief among them the Best Actor Oscar). For the record, I've watched 5 films that were either scripted by Truman Capote or adapted from his books - INDISCRETION OF AN American WIFE (1953), BEAT THE DEVIL (1953), BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S (1961), THE INNOCENTS (1961) and IN COLD BLOOD (1967) - but also his one acting role in MURDER BY DEATH (1976).While the film's title would suggest a biopic, strictly speaking it isn't - as the script focuses on just one, albeit pivotal, incident in the author's life. Its careful depiction of a Midwestern American town gives the film an air of authenticity, but this is contrasted with Capote's flamboyant lifestyle and the high-class milieu he typically inhabits.Thankfully, the film's gay subtext is not overstressed. It is however suggested in Capote's relationship with one of the killers (which I have no way of knowing whether this is how it really was, or whether it was merely 'invented' by the script); the result of this, unfortunately, is that the second killer - displayed in a one-dimensional (i.e. unsympathetic) fashion - doesn't really get his due! I've only watched Richard Brooks' superb film version of IN COLD BLOOD (which was itself remade as a TV mini-series in 1996!) once - but I did recall instances from it (particularly the massacre and the subsequent execution of the culprits) through their representation in CAPOTE - and I would certainly have watched it again now, were my two VCRs not being repaired at the moment!!",8,1,2,5 May 2006
Corpse Bride," CORPSE BRIDE (Tim Burton and Mike Johnson, 2005) ***
","The second 'animated' feature-length offering from Tim Burton (after 1993's THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas which he only produced and co-wrote) is a delight: jaunty, funny and macabre in equal doses with impeccable vocal characterizations by the usual coterie of Burton regulars (Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Albert Finney, Christopher Lee and Michael Gough) and a couple of welcome new inductions (Joanna Lumley, Emily Watson and Richard E. Grant).The musical numbers, courtesy of perennial Burton collaborator Danny Elfman, are quite sprightly and give a cheerful boost to the ostensibly grim goings-on. The story is the stuff of fairy-tales with the usual assortment of shady relatives, and villainous suitors, so what ultimately sticks in the mind is the quirky supporting characters, particularly the maggot's perfectly-etched Peter Lorre impersonation (Enn Reitley).Although, at this remove, I'd say that I enjoyed THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas slightly more than CORPSE BRIDE, it doesn't lessen in any way the latter's remarkable technical achievements, its boundless inventiveness and undoubted entertainment value.",7,0,0,16 March 2006
Gone Baby Gone," GONE BABY GONE (Ben Affleck, 2007) ***
","This is another Oscar contender I managed to catch in time for the ceremony; I’ve never been taken in by Ben Affleck’s supposed acting talent – but it’s also true that his endeavors in other fields, such as his Oscar-winning writing credit on GOOD WILL HUNTING (1997) and his directorial debut here, have been worthier of consideration! The film garnered a fair bit of controversy due to its plot line about the alleged kidnapping of a toddler mirroring the real-life case of Madeleine McCann, in which her own parents may or may not have been implicated; without spoiling the eventual revelation, this element is present in the film as well – but it has been given a decidedly Hollywoodian thriller slant! Anyway, I have to admit that I was expecting this to be a sentimental melodrama as opposed to a compelling thriller in the MYSTIC RIVER (2003) mould; even if the leads (Casey Affleck, the director’s younger brother, and Michelle Monaghan) are far too young to convince as detectives, the film finds veteran Ed Harris (that most underrated of today’s character actors) in sterling form as a shady cop – abetted by the quiet fortitude of the no-less reliable Morgan Freeman as the Head of a Special Section in the local police force dedicated to missing children (which he personally instigated following the loss of his own daughter!) and, especially, a very good i.e. showy Oscar-nominated showcase for virtual unknown Amy Ryan as the little girl’s ‘bad influence’ mum (foul-mouthed and more prone to sleeping around, coke-snorting and drug-dealing than fostering). Perhaps the film’s greatest coup is that the ending offers no easy answers as to whether a child should be allowed to stay with an irresponsible parent simply for reasons of lineage, given the devastating effect this could have on the former’s grown-up life.",7,0,1,27 February 2008
Captain America: The First Avenger," CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER (Joe Johnston, 2011) ***
","Although the character of comic strip hero Captain America has been adapted cinematically as early as 1944 (in a serial that also featured horror stalwart Lionel Atwill) and has been rebooted relatively recently (in two TV movies in the late 1970s – including one in which appeared another genre icon, Christopher Lee! – and a fairly maligned theatrical movie from 1990), this is the first wholly successful transposition of Marvel's original heroic character (as the title itself points out) to the silver screen. Needless to say, as would be the fashion with his later counterparts, the patriotic avenger had also been the protagonist of his own (relatively short) 13-part animated TV series that I fondly recall watching as a kid.Thankfully, the film-makers here wisely decided to adhere to the WWII origins of the character and did not tinker unnecessarily with it by making him hipper so as to be more palatable to the short attention-span audiences of the 21st Century; indeed, when we first see Chris Evans here he is the complete antithesis (short, alarmingly skinny and prone to being beat up every 10 minutes!) of the accepted/expected superhero image. He plays Steve Rogers who, for all his eagerness to do his bit for Uncle Sam, finds himself – just like Buster Keaton in THE GENERAL (1927) – continually rejected and is only thanks to his chance encounter with German scientist (and refugee from the Nazi regime!) Stanley Tucci that he gets to perform his civic duty in ways far more effectively than he could ever have imagined. Incidentally, Evans had earlier made inauspicious superhero appearances as one the 'Fantastic Four' in two middling and decidedly juvenile adventures.The supporting cast is headed by Tommy Lee Jones (initially a stereotype but one eventually warms to him), Hugo Weaving (he had himself played an avenger in V FOR VENDETTA {2006}, and also appeared in THE WOLFMAN {2010} with the same director – his 'Red Skull' make-up elicits uncomfortable comparisons with the awful GHOST RIDER {2007} but the character is well enough written to dispel these immediately), Hayley Atwell (her opinionated character provides a surprisingly fresh take on the typical heroine model in this type of fare) and Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark (father of Tony 'Iron Man' Stark!).The fact that WWII is being fought here by way of enhanced muscles on one side and black magic on the other is liable to displease purists, but the triumph of the little guy over all sorts of adversity is what really counts (with Weaving clearly a substitute for any dictator/terrorist you may wish to cite, and God knows history has provided enough of those!). Still, one would have expected the Fuehrer to put in an appearance and how he planned to deal with 'Red Skull' who was usurping his power and, by way of his disintegrating ray-gun, stealing his thunder! Director Johnston proved an ideal choice, having helmed the similar and equally delightful ROCKETEER (1991). Action scenes are reasonable but, thankfully, not overly cluttered that one cannot figure out what is going on. Interestingly, the CGI effects are employed to shrink Evans' physique rather than to excessively build it up! As for the interlude with Captain America as morale-boosting poster-boy, it may have been a narrative necessity but it is also a dent in the film's pace (despite the evocative use of montage). The finale, then, leaps into the future, making for yet another Samuel L. Jackson cameo as Nick Fury, with the typical (and, by-now, expected) Marvel Studios post-credits sequence actually being the teaser trailer to their blockbuster for next Summer i.e. the superhero and star-studded THE AVENGERS!",7,0,1,15 August 2011
American Hustle," American HUSTLE (David O. Russell, 2013) ***
","As it turned out, I left for last in this year's Oscar race the two best movies – the other being Martin Scorsese's THE WOLF OF WALL STREET – even if that still does not make them masterpieces in my book! Interestingly enough, this is very much styled like a Scorsese picture – and, if one had any doubt for a second about this, a surprise cameo toward the film's last third cements that fact unreservedly! Director Russell has consistently proved himself a deft co-ordinator of ensemble pieces (back from the time of THREE KINGS {1999} and I HEART HUCKABEES {2004}), but especially with his impressive last trio of 'Oscar bait' efforts – namely THE FIGHTER (2010), SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK (2012) and, of course, the title under review.With respect to American HUSTLE, this latter element emerges as both its strength and drawback: it obviously creates some well-defined characters for the talented actors to sink their teeth into but, at the same time, it necessitates that they often take a back seat in order to allow the others to shine or for the complex plot to unravel; this suggests that, in spite of having four nominations in the acting categories (Best Actor Christian Bale, Actress Amy Adams, Supporting Actor Bradley Cooper and Supporting Actress Jennifer Lawrence – it is worth noting, and that in itself is no mean feat, that Bale and Lawrence had already won under Russell's guidance, while Adams and Cooper also received previous nods!), their chance of taking to the Dolby Theatre stage tonight is pretty slimapart, perhaps, from Lawrence, thanks to her wacky antics as the proverbial ditzy blonde! All things considered, however, the performances here do come across as a tad overstated; likewise, while the late 1970s atmosphere is impressively evoked throughout (helped in no small measure by a killer soundtrack that includes Steely Dan, Todd Rundgren, Elton John and David Bowie), the film's visuals seemed inordinately drab to my eyes (unless there was simply something wrong with the print I watched!).The plot, then, is a mix of THE STING (1973) and GOODFELLAS (1990 – yeah, another tip of the hat to Scorsese!): though the con (among those being 'taken' are Jeremy Renner and veteran Anthony Zerbe) took some time to draw me in, it became quite compelling once the Mob was roped in, with the suspense quotient rising in view of their inevitable retribution if the F.B.I. operation's cover were blown. At 138 minutes, the film can seem lengthy and repetitive, but the surface style succeeds in keeping it all together – and, as I said, the characterizations are solid (and, individually, entertaining) enough to anchor the fanciful (albeit true) events in reality.",7,2,7,2 March 2014
Watchmen," WATCHMEN {Theatrical Version} (Zack Snyder, 2009) ***
","A friend of mine had been so disappointed by this one that he wrote so as to spare me from wasting the cost of a cinema ticket and three hours of my life! Having finally caught up with it myself, I could not disagree with him more – not just that but, due to the film's essentially muddled plot line (despite an overgenerous running-time of 162 minutes), I even went so far as to acquire the mammoth 215-minute 'Ultimate Cut' of the film immediately afterwards! To me, this is easily one of the better among the recent flood of comic-strip-inspired blockbusters – with, unsurprisingly, perhaps the one to have the biggest heart. Given Heath Ledger's somewhat over-hyped performance as The Joker in THE DARK KNIGHT (2008), Jackie Earle Haley's turn as Rorschach here (with his classic faceless, yet sentient, mask and mouthing the film's one outstanding line to a bunch of angry jailbirds i.e. 'You don't seem to understand: I'm not locked in here with you – you're locked in here with me!') proved no less memorable or genre-defining. Incidentally, before the project was announced, I had no prior knowledge of the source material (let alone its quasi-legendary status) – so there were no preconceptions about the rigorousness (or not) of the adaptation involved on my part (the result features both uncompromising violence and surprising, albeit vaguely laughable, sex scenes). By the way, having watched all three of Snyder's films (again, this is clearly superior to the others), I would like to see him tackle an original subject next – since DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004) was obviously a remake (of a horror title held in very high regard by many, though not myself!) and 300 (2007) was both that (of the 1962 Rudolph Mate' spectacular) and, like WATCHMEN itself, a cinematic rendition of a graphic novel. What I really liked about this one is its blending of outright fantasy (apart from the typical sci-fi elements of a scientist rendered superhuman in a freak lab accident, there is the gleeful re-write of history – where, among other things, America has not only emerged victorious in the infamous Vietnam conflict but Richard Nixon is still 'serving' as U.S. President in 1985!) with an oppressive noir mood (in which the volatile, cynical Rorschach operates – traded in the climax for an equally forbidding icy wasteland). Also notable is its expert use of music (bafflingly criticized by some) highlighting giants in the field such as Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, The Jimi Hendrix Experience and Leonard Cohen and the intricate but admirably fluid editing wherein, at various points, an incident recalls some past event of particular import. Though, at first, I felt this was going to be undercast, most of the actors involved (many of them new faces to me) acquitted themselves well enough under the circumstances – including Malin Akerman as the sensuous Silk Spectre II and Matthew Goode as the deceptively anodyne Adrian Veidt aka Ozymandias (who seem to have received the lion's share of the flak in this regard). That said, another aspect which was not properly defined here for the uninformed is the individual quality of each 'superhero' (for instance, the Jeffrey Dean Morgan character known as 'The Comedian' is quite the antithesis to what is expected of one, even if only Billy Crudup's Dr. Manhattan – nobly bearing the potential hilarity of his naked blue appearance[!] – is really prodigious in the normal sense). A dense, dazzling and surprisingly satisfactory effort, then, but one that actually leaves the viewer asking for morewhich is why I took the, for me, incongruous plunge of getting hold of an even longer version.",7,1,3,13 March 2010
28 Weeks Later," 28 WEEKS LATER (Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, 2007) ***
","I was sufficiently impressed by the revamping of the zombie sub-genre that was 28 DAYS LATER (2002), though I wasn't particularly looking forward to seeing a sequel to it! That said, the second installment (the film's ending leaves one expecting a third is likely to appear somewhere down the road) exceeded all my expectations and is, possibly, even superior to its predecessor! Anyway, the film is an intense and gore-drenched outing which manages to find new avenues to explore in a theme long since exhausted: the virus which exploded in the first film has apparently been contained; yet a woman surfaces who, though infected, is amazingly immune to the 'rage'. The scientists are eager to study her in order to find a possible antidote but, unwittingly, her husband (Robert Carlyle) gets in contact with her and, soon, there's a new outbreak of the zombie plague! This time, however, the military are taking no chances and issue an order for indiscriminate annihilation of the population – leading to a spectacular sequence as London is engulfed in flames. Carlyle, however, proves to be inordinately tenacious for a zombie – determined to catch up with his children (under constant military protection because they might be immune to the virus as well).While the recurring hand-held cinematography is liable to give one a headache, the film is buoyed by John Murphy's disarming and tremendously effective score. Besides, the presence of the two children – one a boy, the other a teenage girl – gives the whole an unexpected emotional core, which elevates it above the blood-and-guts mentality of most of its ilk. Despite the fact that I've never heard of the director and that the creators of its predecessor – Danny Boyle and Alex Garland – are here relegated to the sidelines, the film is quite deftly staged, with a particularly intense pre-credits sequence and an awesome helicopter zombie massacre.",7,7,14,15 July 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE (Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, 2006) ***
","A deserving Oscar winner for its script and Alan Arkin's performance (though the film is really an ensemble piece), this disarming and perceptive road movie is a veritable sleeper that evokes memories of THE FULL MONTY (1997) and SIDEWAYS (2004)  both of which, incidentally, had also been Oscar outsiders; it provides delightful characterizations and plenty of hilarious situations throughout (especially the theft of a body from a hospital and the climactic disruption of the beauty/talent contest) but is also quite moving on occasion. However, it does lose steam towards the end  Arkin's absence is certainly felt here and much of the contest sequence actually falls flat; therefore, for all the accolades that have been bestowed upon it, I would have been very surprised had it won the Best Picture Oscar!",7,1,2,28 February 2007

","I’d heard a lot of good things about this Spanish ghost story produced by Guillermo del Toro; having finally caught up with it, I can say that its reputation is well deserved – since the generally subtle approach to the genre here puts to shame Hollywood’s current trend in visceral horror! The only real quibble I have with the film is that plotwise it offers relatively little that’s new – though the ending does obfuscate matters a bit by suggesting it may all have occurred merely in the protagonist’s mind! As ever with this type of effort, we have a restless soul from the beyond (usually, it’s a child – which is why they’re so unsettling, and the film’s most haunting image certainly involves the creepy kid with a sack over his head) who, by making contact with a living being, is able to unearth a concealed past crime – even if this came upon following his own ill-fated demise! The film does get the eerie atmosphere centering around a vast, darkened and remote building absolutely right – with cinematography, score and sound being, as expected, carefully deployed; even so, the leading performance from Belen Rueda is notable and, as an added treat, we have a wizened Geraldine Chaplin playing a traditionally eccentric medium (more than the obvious POLTERGEIST [1982] or THE HAUNTING [1963], these scenes reminded of the classic British made-for-TV chiller THE STONE TAPE [1972] by Nigel Kneale). With respect to twists, we have the heroine being unwittingly responsible for her own child’s ghastly death as well as – equally coincidentally – that of the culprit of the old murders (complete with an unnecessarily weird shot of the woman’s dislocated jaw!). Still, the game which Rueda and her kid play – wherein a series of clues will lead to the discovery of some object – is cleverly developed into a motif, thus paving the way for the climactic revelation.For the record, Del Toro had himself earlier delivered two notable efforts revolving around kids – the somewhat similar THE DEVIL’S BACKBONE (2001) and the more elaborate PAN’S LABYRINTH (2006). Incidentally, THE SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE (1973) and CRIA CUERVOS (1975; also with Chaplin) are two other famous Spanish films about childhood – watching her here and Ana Torrent (who actually appears in both of them) in THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL (2008) recently has made me yearn to pick up their Criterion 2-Disc editions which, until now, weren’t that much a priority for me…",7,0,2,11 September 2008
Wanted," WANTED (Timur Bekmambetov, 2008) **1/2
","I was let down by this Russian director's vampire saga of NIGHT WATCH (2005) and DAY WATCH (2007), so I had little interest in this over-the-top actioner (the generic title did not help)that is, until I realized it was adapted from a comic-strip by the same man behind the ultra-violent superhero flick KICK-ASS (2010), which I loved.If anything, the film is fast-paced, unrelenting in gravity-defying action a' la 'The Matrix' (indeed, so extreme is the approach that this could well be dubbed 'When Bullets Collide'!) and engaging enough in plot to be tolerable. Still, James McAvoy does not exactly convince as action hero – nor is Morgan Freeman credible as the brains behind a group of rigorously-trained assassins (whose severe beatings are eventually cured by undertaking a wax bath)! On the other hand, while I could not care less about the gossip-mongering style of Angelina Jolie's private life, her casting is ideal – though the role itself seems to be merely an extension of her MR. AND MRS. SMITH [2005] characterization – and slinky presence obviously easy on the eyes (the fact that an old flame of mine is not just the exact same age as Ms. Jolie but is practically her spitting image never fails to arouse yours truly!); besides, it is nice to see Terence Stamp in anything these days.The mayhem, then, is interpolated with quirky humor (particularly involving McAvoy's messy domestic situation and his relationship with an insufferable and obese female boss) and, for what it is worth, the plot undergoes a 360-degree twist at the finale (resulting in a jaw-dropping mass execution/suicide via one solitary bullet).",6,2,4,25 May 2010
Dreamgirls," DREAMGIRLS (Bill Condon, 2006) ***
","Adapted from a Broadway show but with additional numbers written specifically for the film, this is a rare and brave attempt at an all-black musical. While it was surprising to have GODS AND MONSTERS (1998)'s Bill Condon at the helm, it is confidently made and the musical numbers are energetically staged. Interestingly, the songs aren't just performances by the central group or their irreverent front-man but, at particularly dramatic moments, also serve as a commentary on the narrative itself.While I don't feel that the kind of music involved here can sustain a film of this length (unlike, say, a rock opera) and the second half is incredibly maudlin, the film succeeds by virtue of its meticulous recreation of an era (the hairstyles are fairly hilarious though) and its sounds, and the sheer force of the acting ensemble. Of these, the most acclaimed have deservedly been Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson: the former clearly delivers his best-ever performance as a James Brown-like R&B singer (not that it was hard for him to top his work in the films he's been making for the past 20 years!) but he only really shines in his character's last number, where he goes on stage drunk and embarrasses himself in front of live and TV audiences; in hindsight, his storming off of the Academy Awards ceremony for failing to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar was an infantile gesture. As for Jennifer Hudson, prior to watching the film I was skeptical about how deserving she really was of all the accolades her role garnered but, actually, her performance is the best and most heartfelt in the film and she manages to steal all the scenes she's in from under the noses of her more seasoned colleagues.Having said all that, however, where the film falls is in the blandness and predictability of the narrative: there was no way the Beyonce' character was not going to be boosted to diva status, no way Eddie Murphy was not going to fall for one of the Dreamettes, no way he was not going to end up dead, no way his manager (played by Danny Glover) was not going to be pushed by the wayside, etc. The 'reunion' happy ending, too, is something of a cop-out because the film, after exposing the underbelly of the music industry, steers clear of addressing how this will eventually affect the fate of its protagonists.",7,0,0,25 June 2007
Jarhead," JARHEAD (Sam Mendes, 2005) **1/2
","I've watched all of Mendes' films so far (not to mention a stage adaptation of Chekov's 'Uncle Vanya' directed by him and co-starring Emily Watson during my week-and-a-half stay in London in 2002) but every new effort seems to me to be a lesser achievement than the previous one! Anyway, while the film is essentially  and typically  well-made (particularly the editing, propelled by an eclectic soundtrack), it's also unoriginal since it basically rips off FULL METAL JACKET (1987)  but is inferior to it in every way (with the second half, as described further down in my comments, being even more of a let-down than that film's!)  as well as having elements from both SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998) and particularly BLACK HAWK DOWN (2001) thrown in for good measure! Despite good performances by the established actors (Gyllenhaal, Sarsgaard, Foxx and Cooper) and the fact that the film is based on true events, the characters are total stereotypes (with the sex-obsessed camaraderie being especially alienating)though the recruits' frustration/jealousy over their respective partners back home, albeit over-emphasized, is perhaps the film's sole novelty! Besides, it's disappointing that the soldiers see no real action during their stay in the war zone  and neither is the intriguing suggestion that a war veteran remains inclined towards violence and never truly readjusts to civilian life developed in any waywhich, ultimately, renders the whole thing somewhat pointless!",6,0,1,23 April 2006
Ratatouille," RATATOUILLE (Brad Bird and Jan Pinkava, 2007) ***
","Surprising exploring rodents in the kitchen is every restaurateur's (or housewife's) nightmare but the makers of this amiable animated movie turn that situation nicely on its head by making their protagonist a first-class gourmet that conveniently guides his artless master to fame and fortune in the culinary arts. Despite being the secret son of a famous (but subsequently) disgraced chef, he is engaged as a caretaker in his late father's bistro and mistreated by just everybody, especially the ambitious Head Chef who has his own designs on the place. However, his biggest nemesis is the fearsome food critic (splendidly voiced by Peter O'Toole) whose scathing review had sent his own father to an early grave and is intent on finding out just what the fuss of the revamped restaurant is all about. Aiding him in ditching his persecutors (including the belated appearance of a sanitary official) are a tough but conventional female cook, the friendly and constantly inventive mouse and, at the climax  just when everything seems lost after his employees quit him en masse upon discovering who the true gastronomical genius really is  the rat's entire family who find themselves engaged as impromptu cooks!

Dallas Buyers Club," DALLAS BUYERS CLUB (Jean-Marc Vallee', 2013) ***
","While this can be seen as typical 'Oscar bait' material – dealing as it does with terminal illness and gender-bending and being a biopic on top of all that – there is no denying that it is a compelling and stylishly- handled affair (among the film's six nominations are ones for Best Picture, Original Screenplay and Editing). I had never been that much impressed with handsome Matthew McConaughey's work prior to this, given that it was mainly restricted to what passes for a romantic comedy these days; still, I am familiar with such dramatic films as the John Grisham adaptation A TIME TO KILL (1996), Steven Spielberg's AMISTAD (1997) and the Malta-shot WWII submarine flick U-571 (2000) and, for the record, I have yet to catch him in CONTACT (1997), William Friedkin's KILLER JOE (2011), MAGIC MIKE (2012) and Martin Scorsese's THE WOLF OF WALL STREET – which is itself one of this year's major Oscar contenders, so I will be getting to that one soon enough.However, McConaughey's exceptional performance here really breathes life into a basically unsavory character – even if I doubt his shenanigans were truly as colourful as they are depicted throughout the movie! He plays a virile and hard-living rodeo cowboy who suddenly discovers he has contracted AIDS; after the initial incredulity, rather than wallowing in self-pity, he embarks on a private crusade to look into means of treating the HIV virus – especially when it transpires that the only legally prescribed drug in the U.S. was more life-threatening than health-restoring, causing him to go underground in other countries like Mexico and Japan and eventually start a booming business (which is what the title refers to) sharing his findings with other afflicted patients. One of his closest collaborators is cross-dressing junkie Jared Leto (equally impressive), whose obvious knowledge of the gay scene – which McConaughey abhors at first but then learns to tolerate – is essential in procuring him eligible 'clients'. Both actors are deservedly at the head of their respective category in next Sunday's Oscar race (having already won the Golden Globe and SAG awards); almost just as assuredly 'in-the-bag' is the film's remaining nod for Best Make-up And Hairstyling – which unflinchingly illustrates the increasingly devastating effects of the disease (McConaughey even slimmed down considerably for the role). The supporting cast includes sympathetic doctor Jennifer Garner, Steve Zahn as the protagonist's long-suffering cop brother and a practically unrecognizable Griffin Dunne in the part of the discharged physician, relocated to Mexico, who alerts McConaughey of his alternative (and more beneficial) cure. As I said earlier, the hero's brushes with the customs and medical authorities – entertaining though they may be, with the protagonist often disguising himself as a sickly priest – seem a bit far-fetched under the circumstances; ditto the unlikely presence of 'rodeo groupies' servicing competing riders before entering the arena! Actually, the most shocking aspect of all this is that while McConaughey cleans up his act when hit by the disease – jettisoning booze, drugs and processed food – he finds it hard to curb his hedonism and still engages in watching porn, frequenting strippers and even make love to an attractive full- blown AIDS victimand Leto himself expires from a drug overdose! Incidentally, despite the clearly defined time-frame of events, the movie's production design (or, for that matter, T-Rex-dominated soundtrack) never really brings out that unmistakable feeling of being in the 1980s!",7,1,2,26 February 2014
Control," CONTROL (Anton Corbijn, 2007) ***
","The haunting music of Joy Division transcended the band's minimal output and modest cult status among British indie bands to become a highly influential sound. Shot in color but desaturized to be shown in black-and- white, CONTROL is a carefully-made biopic of their troubled singer Ian Curtis who, at just 23 years of age, tragically took his own life to become rock's first celebrity suicide. Although I had thought that this fateful decision was taken mainly on account of his debilitating epileptic condition, the film reveals that this had more to do with the fact that Curtis, being clearly unwilling to embark on Joy Division's impending first U.S. tour, had lost control of the band he fronted for (hence the title) and, more importantly, was deeply conflicted about the two relationships he had going on at the same time  with his wife Deborah back home (who had also borne him a daughter) and a Belgian amateur journalist/groupie that followed him around when performing. Based on Mrs. Curtis' memoirs, the film by necessity concentrates more on his personal than creative life; besides, director Corbijn, a former music video helmer, knew the band members personally and creates a remarkably straightforward and affectionate portrayal of Curtis' life and times. Apart from Samantha Morton (as Deborah), the cast is virtually made up of unknowns: at first, Sam Riley did not seem to me to look much like the real Ian Curtis but, before long, he had effectively inhabited the character (down to his awkward moves during Joy Division's stage act); the lovely Alexandra Maria Lara (whom I had actually already watched in DOWNFALL [2004] and YOUTH WITHOUT YOUTH [2007] as Curtis' Belgian girlfriend, Annik Honore') and Toby Kebbell (as the band's overzealous manager Rob Gretton) also score in the acting stakes. Furthermore, the extraneous music is well-chosen: apart from the well-documented fact of Curtis having watched Werner Herzog's STROSZEK (1977) and listened to Iggy Pop's 'The Idiot' (1977) just before hanging himself, we also have The Velvet Underground (another band whose musical legacy ran a similar course to Joy Division's), David Bowie (ironically, Curtis is seen listening to the chameleon artist's own crossover album 'Aladdin Sane' [1973], written during his first U.S. tour!), Roxy Music and The Sex Pistols.",7,0,0,13 March 2009
Saw III," SAW III (Darren Lynn Bousman, 2006) *1/2
","The first film was compelling and highly original; the second was below par and forgettable; this third entry is among the most repulsive I've ever watched: its relentless gloating (in glorious close-up) on pain and flesh ripping is positively insulting; I've yet to catch up with several recent horror titles but there's no clearer indication than this of how low the genre has sunk - it has literally gone down the drain! The plot itself is mildly intriguing and even features a nice final twist - but the film's parade of gore, creative torture devices (God only knows where the moribund 'avenger' picks up the various parts, not to mention the energy to build them!) and self-pitying characters makes for unintentional hilarity all the way through!",2,3,6,9 February 2007
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD (Edgar Wright, 2010) **1/2
","Touted as a cult-classic-in-the-making, I decided to check this out – despite being lukewarm on the director's popular earlier effort SHAUN OF THE DEAD (2004) – on the strength of the not dissimilar but far superior KICK-ASS (2010). This, in fact, concerns a geeky young man turning unexpectedly into a hero; still, it is not a typical comic-strip adaptation – what it is, I am not really sure, except to say that it epitomizes the film-as-video-game mentality! Mind you, it is all somewhat enjoyable (especially the incongruous camaraderie –including Scott's gay room-mate and members of his rock group being named Stephen Stills and Young Neil!) yet too silly to leave much of a lasting impression. The plot involves the titular character falling for a mystery girl (winsome Mary Elizabeth Winstead, whom I had watched in four previous films yet only now did she catch my attention!) but, in order to be with her, he has to first defeat her seven former flings and also drop his own current lover, an underage Japanese girl! The villains include special guest stars – the term is to be used lightly here – like Chris Evans (an ex-Fantastic 4 and soon-to-be Captain America!) as an arrogant movie idol, Brandon Routh (the most recent Superman) as a vain alien(!) and Jason Schwartzman as the evil boss of the lot, the very music mogul to whom the hero's outfit would be signed if they were to win a battle-of-the-bands-type contest; three other opponents were fellow participants (two of them twins), and yet another a lesbian!",6,3,6,16 March 2011
Quantum of Solace," QUANTUM OF SOLACE (Marc Forster, 2008) **1/2
","Daniel Craig has had to face almost as tough an opposition as James Bond does in his movies when he took on the role of everybody's favorite British secret agent two years ago but CASINO ROYALE (2006) had effectively silenced his critics by being, for my money, one of the all-time Top 5 entries in the long-running series. However, I can see an onslaught of bad vibes creeping up again following his second stab at the role. Actually, he's not really the one to blame as his is a good performance under the circumstances; clearly, the major culprits here are the screenwriters and director for not really understanding (or caring enough) who James Bond is – and has been for practically the last half-a-century – and the producers (who should have known better) for letting them tamper with the beloved character far too much.Before I sat down to watch this, I skimmed through online film forums to gauge the general reaction to the new Bond outing and, being a largely negative one, I prepared myself for the worst. While the film didn't prove to be as bad as all that, it's still inferior to its direct predecessor to such a dispiriting extent that the production team decidedly need to go back to the drawing-board fast if the next installment is to keep the momentum brought on by the breath of fresh air that CASINO ROYALE had been. It's well-known by now that, uncharacteristically for the series, QUANTUM OF SOLACE is a continuation of that film's storyline in that Bond is more interested in rooting out the man responsible for the death of his precious Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) – despite his all-too evident bitterness (read emotionless brutality) at her betrayal of him – than he is in catching the bad guys in this one.And, frankly, who can blame him when he's saddled with a potentially impotent wimp of a villain (Mathieu Almaric) – with an even more effete right-hand man – whose nefarious crimes extend merely to controlling the water supply of Bolivia to the detriment of the perpetually poor populace? Besides, Vesper Lynd had conclusively proved not to be just another Bond girl in more ways than one – being a woman whose death Bond was still mourning and a memorable character in her own right. Despite the beauty of her substitute here (which still comes up short, if you ask me, next to the stunning Miss Green), the character of Camille (Olga Kurylenko) is so one-dimensional that Bond doesn't even entertain the notion of making love to her (a first for a Bond film for sure) and the one episode where he does go to bed with a girl – a red-headed M16 desk clerk (Gemma Arterton) that goes by the name of Strawberry Fields ('tis pity she didn't wear flowers in her hair, though) – seems like an afterthought merely intended to make her death scene a welcome tribute to Shirley Eaton's iconic fate in GOLDFINGER (1964)! After the extended, breathlessly-paced opening action sequence, I wasn't too bothered by the rapid cutting which is said to imitate the BOURNE trilogy (but I wouldn't really know since I'm not familiar with it and have little interest in finding out) but, apart from a good sequence at the Opera House, even the action set-pieces seemed indifferent to me. Equally pointless were the cameo appearances of both Giancarlo Giannini and Jeffrey Wright from CASINO ROYALE but the low-point of the movie must surely be the fact that the villain – lame though he might be – gets his come-uppance off-screen (which must be another first for this series)! The obligatory title song (performed by Jack White and Alicia Keys) has also received a lot of flak but, again, I didn't find it as painful to listen to as others seem to have. Significantly, however, while QUANTUM OF SOLACE is, at 106 minutes, officially the shortest-running Bond movie ever (which is all the more remarkable because it follows the longest entry of all), it feels much longer than that – which is never a positive sign. One final thing: I still don't quite know what to make of the film-makers' decision to go back in time with Bond – making him a still up-and-coming secret agent that has yet to earn M's complete trust – and yet have him operate in this advanced technological age of ours (represented by mobile phones and touch-screen graphics).",6,4,9,19 November 2008
District 9," DISTRICT 9 (Neill Blomkamp, 2009) ***
","Despite my general aversion to contemporary movie fare, I usually try to keep abreast of my favorite genre (Fantasy i.e. Horror and Sci-Fi) and, in fact, have been looking forward to catching this acclaimed recent example. Apart from its mixed origins (this is an American-Canadian-Kiwi and South African production that includes Peter Jackson as one of its producers), the film's major claim to fame is the fact that it garnered 4 Academy Award nominations including an unprecedented one for Best Picture! For what it is worth, it is also currently at No. 122 on the IMDb's all-time Top 250!! In hindsight, I do feel that DISTRICT 9 is somewhat overrated: what we have here is, basically, a combination of Steven Spielberg's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND (1977) and James Cameron's ALIENS (1986) and, therefore, despite the obvious intelligence on display, also with a clear eye towards hitting the box office jackpot. With this in mind, one is expected to forgive (and, indeed, embrace) the presence of a 'cute' alien kid who, unexpectedly, bonds (as does his ambitious father) with the hunted (and highly unlikely) human hero. As portrayed by virtual unknown Sharlto Copley, it was a nice touch to make him a nerdy, soft-spoken and nervous type and I was disappointed to hear him burst into a constant array of expletives in the second half of the movie where he has to contend with macho South African arms dealers and his former colleagues now bent on destroying him.Actually, the unusual South African background against which this action-packed morality play takes place adds much to the mix and perhaps even invites the film-makers' tendency towards gore and tastlessness – not least in their decision to make the prawn-like alien design such a disgusting one! Incidentally, the following day after watching this one I also caught several of director Blomkamp's previous short films, namely: ADIDAS ADICOLOR – YELLOW (**1/2), ALIVE IN JOBURG (**1/2; something of a precursor to DISTRICT 9 itself, with Copley in much the same role), CITROEN C4 – ALIVE WITH TECHNOLOGY (**), HALO – LANDFALL (**1/2), NIKE – CRAB (**), NIKE – EVOLUTION (**1/2), TEMPBOT (**1/2) and TETRA VAAL (**1/2).",7,0,6,27 June 2010
The Princess Bride," THE PRINCESS BRIDE (Rob Reiner, 1987) **1/2
","I knew of this film's reputation as a cult item before going in but, for the life of me, despite a few amusing scenes scattered throughout, I just can't fathom why this is so! Pleasant though it is, it's patchy at best and it was never laugh-out-loud funny either. This is especially disappointing considering that the film was written by Oscar winner William Goldman (of BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID [1969] fame) and directed by Rob Reiner, who had earlier given us the uproarious THIS IS SPINAL TAP (1984)! The admittedly eccentric cast struggles to evoke the fairy-tale quality inherent in the premise - with Wallace Shawn, Christopher Guest and Billy Crystal being the most successful at it - but, if the film was meant as a spoof, I'm sorry to say that it doesn't have much of a bite...especially since I can hardly remember anything about it a mere two days later!!",6,7,17,13 March 2006
1941," 1941 {Extended Version} (Steven Spielberg, 1979) **1/2
","To begin with, I consider Spielberg to be one of Hollywood's most overrated film-makers; thankfully, every so often, a dud effort such as this one comes along to remind us just how erratic his talent really is! For the record, I had watched the released 118-minute version on Italian TV as a kid but, checking out the longer 'Director's Cut', I recalled precious little of it – so that I could not tell what constituted the new footage; frankly, I am glad I did not rush out to purchase the 'Collector's Edition' DVD, since I was pretty much let down by the whole thing. The idea of treating the fear of further attacks on American soil after Pearl Harbor as a comedy was certainly sound – and typical of the freewheeling 1970s – yet I cannot help feeling that Spielberg was the wrong choice for it; the result (reliant on 'Saturday Night Live'-type routines) is grossly self-indulgent that, in view of an overall lack of structure and heavy-handed approach, becomes increasingly tiresome and ultimately uninvolving! Given my harsh judgment so far, one might be forgiven in wondering why I rated it the way I did rather than opt for an even lesser evaluation; well, the eclectic all-star cast does lend the film some weight – with Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi (in one of his signature roles as a gung-ho but inept fighter pilot), Christopher Lee (speaking exclusively in German throughout!), Toshiro Mifune, Slim Pickens and Robert Stack (as an American General displaying child-like enthusiasm at a screening of Walt Disney's DUMBO [1941]!) coming off best; for the rest, we get references to (and three cast members from) Spielberg's own JAWS (1975) – including an inspired semi-recreation/spoof of that film's memorable opening sequence! Still, most of the youngsters (who, alas, take up much of the running-time) prove merely bland, while a number of would-be star cameos (notably Samuel Fuller's) fall resoundingly flat!; for what it is worth, I did not catch director John Landis' appearance, the ubiquitous Dick Miller is on hand, and Mickey Rourke makes his debut here too! One last thing: I wonder what American audiences – or, for that matter, the people who made it – think of the film nowadays in view of 9/11...",6,0,2,24 January 2010
Django Unchained," DJANGO UNCHAINED (Quentin Tarantino, 2012) ***
","In hindsight, given how extensively he had been 'inspired' (read copiously pilfered) from it in his previous 7 films, it seems somewhat surprising to me how it took Quentin Tarantino 20 years to make his own pastiche-cum-tribute to the Spaghetti Western. Rather than the taciturn Leone/Eastwood hero 'The Man With No Name', he picks the sub-genre's second best-known icon to do so – which is just as well since he subverts him into a caustic smart-ass of a colored slave, thus enabling Tarantino to hit two birds with one stone and equally pay would-be homage to such infamous exploitation fare as GOODBYE UNCLE TOM (1971) and MANDINGO (1975). Where it does ape Leone's celebrated Western quintet is in the sheer time it takes to tell its simple tale of revenge (165 minutes as of this sitting) but there have already been rumors circulating that a lot of footage was left on the cutting room floor after The Weinsteins vetoed Tarantino's desire to release the film in two parts! As if wishing to stress the fact that his version of the critically much-maligned (if clearly beloved of film buffs) sub-genre is superior to and artistically more valid than its antecedents, he takes great pains to point out that his is a 'Southern' (set in America's Deep South, y'see) and not just a mere Western. Such earnestness to be taken seriously would have carried far more weight if we were not subjected to so much cartoonish violence (with the fakest use of blood squibs imaginable) throughout the entire film! Carrying on from his previous movies, however, we find a typically excellent ensemble cast at work here with Christoph Waltz, Leonardo Di Caprio and especially Samuel L. Jackson and Don Johnson (seriously) shining the brightest. Just like any number of the film's blood-soaked corpses, it is also riddled with knowing cameos, from Franco Nero to Bruce Dern – most of whom, buried as they are under whiskers and the ravages of time, went by unnoticed (Robert Carradine, Lee Horsley, Ted Neeley, Michael Parks, Don Stroud, Russ Tamblyn and Tom Wopat); unfortunately, the egocentric film-maker does not even spare us from a bloated, middle-aged appearance of himself as a mining company employee sporting arguably the worst Aussie accent on record!The central couple of Django and Broomhilde Von Shaft (yeah, the ancestor of Detective John Shaft, dig it?) are competently enough played by Jamie Foxx and Kerry Washington but it is very evident (particularly in the film's tastelessly upbeat final scenes) that Tarantino had Will Smith in mind when he wrote the screenplay; besides, the clearly Homeric (or rather Sigfriedian, given her Germanic name) overtones intended for Django's long-winded quest would have been far more relevant had Washington been made to be Mississippi landowner Di Caprio's mistress rather than just a kitchen maid!! Their past lives, then, are intermittently displayed via a series of rather pointless and gratuitously flashy flashbacks. Frankly, however, (whatever our personal feelings towards the man himself might be) we do not keep on going to watch Tarantino's films for their pointed character studies but to see how they fare in the 'coolly quotable dialogue' and 'clevery obscure in-jokes' departments: even though there are predictably reams of dialogue here, on a first viewing only a handful register as memorable at all (chiefly among them the brief exchange between Foxx and Nero on the spelling of the 'Django' name; another one between Di Caprio and Jackson regarding Washington's German heritage; and the animated rendition of Jackson's colorful insults usually hurled towards Foxx; Waltz's ludicrous conclusion that 'Alexandre Dumas was black' is best forgotten, however). Telllingly, the film's highlight is not an action set-piece but a subdued confrontation between Di Caprio and Foxx on their way to the latter's lavish abode Candyland. What is worse is that the film is oddly repetitive in both dialogue (some words keep cropping upand not just the dreaded 'N' word) and action (Di Caprio gets his comeuppance exactly in the same way as a sheriff did earlier in the movie!); Jackson's explosive end, then, seems like an impersonal one given how despicable he had been toward Django, his wife and their own race!! Finally, the film is marked by some significant changes in Tarantino's personnel, namely producer Lawrence Bender and his late editor Sally Menke; it is a shame, however, that he did not also dispense with the services of The RZA (courtesy of some ill-judged rap rants) on the soundtrack – which, includes the title track of the obscure 1971 Spaghetti Western HIS NAME WAS KING (used here as the theme tune of Waltz's character) and a rather blah new song composed by Ennio Morricone himself! For the record, DJANGO UNCHAINED has been named Best Film Of The Year by The American Film Institute, is up for 5 Golden Globes (but the winners will only be announced in tomorrow's ceremony) and has just been nominated for another 5 Academy awards (but, surprisingly enough, both Tarantino and Di Caprio have been snubbed)!",7,12,24,12 January 2013
Drive," DRIVE (Nicolas Winding Refn, 2011) ***
","This first caught my attention by its surprise win of the Best Director award at the Cannes Film Festival; just this week, then, a local friend also highly recommended it and, since the movie has not yet been released over here, I acquired it via ulterior sources. Actually, it appears that the edition I ended up with was not the finished version but rather a workprint which, instead of utilizing the score composed by Angelo Badalamenti (a pertinent choice given the film's Lynchian tone) for the entire duration incorporated cues from the Oscar-winning soundtrack of THE SOCIAL NETWORK (2010) – a fact that immediately stood out to me while watching – and did not even feature the end credits but rather a blank screen accompanied by more indiscriminate and intermittent music snippets! Anyway, given the foreign-sounding director's name (of whose previous work I was only vaguely familiar with VALHALLA RISING {2009} and who, coincidentally, has just turned 41!), this could hardly be expected to emulate the Hollywood action formula – so that the ensuing European sensibility that runs throughout baffled audiences not attuned to (or prepared for) it, while delighting those used to movies which employed silence at least as eloquently as sound and speech! Likewise, I had not watched leading man Ryan Gosling in anything prior to this (despite having a handful of lauded films to his name), so I was a bit wary of his supposedly cool demeanor, given the actor's scrawny physique! That said, while I was sufficiently impressed with Gosling's contribution, I still could not reconcile myself to the fact that a stunt/getaway driver should automatically possess the 'angel of vengeance' faculties (though I concede that he is, by necessity, streetwise and quick-witted) displayed by the hero along the way! Incidentally, while the central character has been likened to Clint Eastwood's Man-With-No-Name in Sergio Leone's 'Dollars' trilogy and Alain Delon's similarly enigmatic and taciturn hit-man Jef Costello in Jean-Pierre Melville's LE SAMOURAI (1967), a more obvious model would be Robert De Niro's deranged Vietnam vet Travis Bickle in Martin Scorsese's TAXI DRIVER (1976) – in which, at least, the protagonist's survival tactics can be excused, and we even get an equivalent here of that film's misguided date at the porno theater (which had naturally alienated girlfriend Cybill Shepard) in the elevator 'face stomping' scene (witnessed by the head-shaking heroine, neighbor and impossible-object-of-desire Carey Mulligan) clearly inspired by the notorious visage-squashed-by-fire-extinguisher opening of Gaspar Noe's IRREVERSIBLE (2002). Other easily identifiable links to the picture can be found in Don Siegel's THE KILLERS (1964), John Boorman's POINT BLANK (1967) as well as, it goes without saying, Walter Hill's THE DRIVER (1978), while the hero's chivalrous protection of a lonely woman and her son is borrowed from innumerable Westernsand, yet, it is amusing to just consider how modern film-buffs who staunchly believe that cinema began with Quentin Tarantino will only ever see his influence – in the form of foul-mouthed dialogue, seedy underworld figures, farcical violence and the non-linear structure of the climax! With this in mind, the finale is left open-ended, though the director reportedly stated that he likes to think the protagonist lived on to engage in further adventures in another city (though this would imbue him with quasi-mythical connotations that are incompatible with the unpronounced but very human love story at its core!).Mind you, the film is one of the best noir-ish thrillers of recent vintage: I was especially reminded of Steven Soderbergh's Elmore Leonard adaptation OUT OF SIGHT (1998) – not least because of the presence (again as a mobster) of Albert Brooks here – even if the Tarantino-worshippers will doubtless point out that he had himself put his stamp on the author's work with JACKIE BROWN (1997)! Other cast members include Ron Perlman (as Brooks' imposing Jewish associate, who gets a great 'exit'), ROBIN HOOD (2010)'s Oscar Isaac (as the ex-convict who seeks to capitalize on Gosling's criminal savvy as payback for the latter's interest in his wife, Mulligan) and, according to the IMDb, Russ Tamblyn (but, for the life of me, I failed to spot him!).",7,3,34,30 September 2011
Frozen," FROZEN (Chris Buck & Jennifer Lee, 2013) ***
","Given the mass of animated features of late, it becomes hard to discern which stable any given title derives from; given the Walt Disney Studios' monopoly of the market for so many decades, their efforts remain among the more popular but not necessarily the best with respect to both box-office performance or, for that matter, when accolades are doled out. So, when the film under review copped 2 Oscars (Best Animated Feature and Original Song 'Let It Go') at last Sunday's ceremony, I thought of checking it out now rather than wait for the Christmas season â€“ for which period I usually leave such family-oriented fare!In retrospect and, to my surprise, the end result was generally very satisfactory â€“ evoking favourable memories of some of the brand name's better efforts of the last 25 years! The narrative is inspired by a Hans Christian Andersen fairy-tale (of which I also own but have yet to watch a 1966 live-action Russian version). The icy setting is appropriately elaborate and nicely detailed, while characterization is reasonably appealing â€“ at least where the two female protagonists are concerned, and especially with respect to their unusually tense relationship, as well as the obligatory comic-relief sidekick (represented by a garrulous snowman called Olaf who has a carrot for a nose, is constantly getting dismembered and, at one point, even deadpans about having been impaled on a jutting piece of ice!). On the heroic side of things, we have a stocky woodcutter and his sympathetic reindeer but, oddly enough, the orphaned princesses are shown growing up sans guardians!Conversely, the rogues' gallery â€“ involving an elderly foreign tradesman and a young, deceptively handsome but opportunistic visiting prince â€“ seems decidedly weak in comparison; similarly, the would-be sinister elements â€“ a group of wise and friendly trolls on one hand and a giant snow creature (whom we thought had been disposed of but reappears for the, by now inevitable, post-credits sequence!) on the other â€“ somehow feel like an afterthought! The climax, too, is sort of underwhelming because the sense of awe expected, after considerable build-up (and the film clocks in at a hefty 102 minutes), is rather lacking!; still, the songs â€“ which are definitely not what I look forward to the most in efforts of this type â€“ prove surprisingly tolerable on this occasion...which brings us back to 'Let It Go', whose live performance during Oscar night was not only introduced by John Travolta apparently struggling with a bad hair day, but he also went on to spectacularly mispronounce singer Idina Menzel's name (incidentally, the star quality typically found among the engaged voice artists is conspicuous in its absence here) as Adele Dazeem while obliged to wax about her 'wicked' talents!",7,2,7,8 March 2014
Ghost Rider," GHOST RIDER {Theatrical Version} (Mark Steven Johnson, 2007) **
","The recent spurt of comic-book adaptations about superheroes have been extremely variable: some – like the “Spider-Man” and “X-Men” films – were pretty good but, then, HULK (2003) proved a major disappointment; others still, like DAREDEVIL (2003) and the “Fantastic Four” series (just yesterday I checked out the second instalment!), were enjoyable but essentially bland. About the worst of them has been THE PUNISHER (2004) – but now I can add GHOST RIDER to that unenviable list; this is one lame movie (made by the director of DAREDEVIL) which, for all its CGI effects and name actors, really comes off like a cheap 80s ‘indie’ horror flick! The would-be Faustian plot is ludicrous to begin with, but the vacuous presence of the perennially grimacing Nicolas Cage (an actor I can’t stand) renders it even less interesting (bungling even the potentially cool “Ghost Rider” persona); ditto, the motorcycle stunts (it doesn’t help that I’m the antithesis of a sports enthusiast!). Besides, the hesitant love story doesn’t have the effect that it ought to – while the obnoxious gang of ‘hellish’ villains provide the final death-knell to the film! At least, Peter Fonda (teetering on the brink of camp) and Sam Elliott – both of whom, appropriately but perhaps unintentionally, seem to have strayed in from another era! – have fun with their roles of Mephistopheles and Cage’s predecessor as “Ghost Rider” respectively...",4,1,3,10 July 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," X-MEN: THE LAST STAND (Brett Ratner, 2006) ***
","This is possibly the best in the series, due to the development in the relationships between the various mutants on both sides (though so many of them have grown complexes by the end of the film that the final confrontation is virtually fought between a handful of brash but inexperienced mutant kids about whom we don't really care!).It also utilizes a familiar device in superhero films where the latter (or, in this case, one of them) is converted to the evil side. Besides, one of the villainous mutants who has been 'cured' (the main novelty here is that a boy's special power is that he can turn mutants into normal human beings!) betrays its comrades after having been scorned by them.Still, the effects are overwhelming and at times threaten to drown the narrative. Also, the fact that the leaders of both sides (Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen - who are digitally rejuvenated in an early flashback sequence, surely the film's weirdest-looking effect! - are either killed or stripped of their powers) would indicate that this truly is the final entry in the series...but the last shot suggests otherwise!!",7,0,1,18 August 2006
Across the Universe," ACROSS THE UNIVERSE (Julie Taymor, 2007) ***
","One of my (many) pet peeves with modern movies is their penchant for including redundant cover versions of classic rock songs by today's would-be superstars so as to make them more palatable to mainstream i.e. teenage audiences too young to remember the originals or those who performed them. Needless to say, I was very sarcastic about the potentially disastrous  not to mention blasphemous  idea of making a musical film with the immortal songs of The Beatles (mostly) sung by a group of anonymous young actors. Even if, in hindsight, the film is not without its flaws, I must applaud veteran screenwriters Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenais and director Julie Taymor  not just for their bravery in making this almost impossible task work but because, more often than not, the results are brilliant and occasionally dazzling.To begin with, 33 songs from The Beatles' repertoire are redressed to suit the actors who perform them and the characters they portray are also named after famous Beatles creations: the main protagonists are British dockyard-worker Jude (Jim Sturgess) who goes to America to look for his janitor father whom he has never met; along the way, he makes friends with spoiled rich kid Max (Joe Anderson) and soon falls for his sister Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood); meanwhile, their sluttish landlady Sadie (Dana Fuchs) is silently lusted after by Asian misfit Prudence (T.V. Carpio) but the former has set her own sights on colored guitarist Jo-Jo (Martin Luther McCoy) whom she engages in her own rock band. The narrative takes on some of the most important events in late-1960s American history  the Civil Rights protests, the Vietnam War, etc.  as Max is enrolled in the Army, Lucy becomes a political radical, Sadie's band are stopped by the police while playing a rooftop concert (recalling The Beatles' own famous farewell performance!), they all ramble through America in a bus and Prudence joins a traveling circus show... Some of the song numbers are ambitious and inventively realized: it's hard not to love seeing Joe Cocker playing a vagrant in a train station as he twitches himself into the first bars of 'Come Together' or having Bono as the eccentric Dr. Robert bursting into 'I Am The Walrus' during a psychedelia-tinged party sequence but it's the partly-animated 'I Want You (She's So Heavy)' army-recruiting sequence which impresses the most; still, the more pastoral passages like 'Because' (sung by the stoned group of friends as they lie carefree on the village green) and Evan Rachel Wood's solo 'If I Fell' are quietly remarkable in their own right. However, not every song revisit is a success: circus barker Eddie Izzard's 'Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite' is surprisingly dreadful, Sturgess' low-key rendition of 'Revolution' is ineffective and, unfortunately, 'Happiness Is A Warm Gun' (one of my favorite Beatles album tracks) is marred by some uncalled for choreographic gymnastics! Still as a cinematic collage based on The Beatles' Songbook as performed by other people, it's far more successful than it has a right to be and clearly light years ahead of the notoriously abysmal SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND (1978) and, consequently, essential viewing for long-time Beatles fans of all persuasions.",7,3,5,9 February 2008
The Mist," THE MIST (Frank Darabont, 2007) ***
","Of the 108 Stephen King adaptations for film or TV, I am only familiar with a handful of them – 16 to be exact (counting also the film under review). Frank Darabont joins a list of remarkable past alumni (Brian De Palma, Stanley Kubrick, David Cronenberg, John Carpenter) with this well-crafted monster movie with pretensions. Actually, Darabont is no newcomer to Stephen King territory – having already based three of his four feature-length movies on his work! – but this is the first movie I’ve seen from the director and, perhaps significantly, the only one of the three which is horror-related.Frankly, I wasn’t even aware of the film at all before reviews of its DVD release started cropping up on the Internet. As far as I can recall, it has not yet been released theatrically over here but, perhaps the name Stephen King (because of rampant overexposure over the years) nowadays no longer enjoys the same crowd-pulling effect as it did during his heyday. Still, judging by that modest crowd of actors assembled for the film and its clearly intentional “realism” (read a flat, made-for-TV look and relatively restrained gore), the film-makers hardly endeavored to boost its box-office chances any. Besides, we have lately been literally invaded by monster/alien movies so that it isn’t hard for one (even as solid as this one is) to get lost in the shuffle.A small seaside American town wakes up one morning to find itself enveloped in a mysterious cloud of thick mist. Soon enough, it becomes abundantly evident that this houses a barrage of slimy, unnaturally-enlarged and very deadly creatures of the bugs variety. To this tried-and-tested formula, Darabont and King add other much-used elements (religious fanaticism, military incompetence, scientific experimentation, impending apolcalypse, etc.) but take them beyond their bleakest and most ironic possibilities. The last half-hour, in fact, is where the film gets all choked up in message-mongering – complete with an overwhelmingly melancholic score which seemed more appropriate accompaniment to a depiction of Christ’s Cruxifiction (or something heavy and solemn like that). Indeed, learning that Darabont has even “presented” his own original black-and-white vision (as opposed to version) of this film on DVD only adds smoke to the fiery theory that this was intended from the start to be much more than a mere monster movie. Despite good work all around and the best intentions, THE BIRDS (1963), it certainly ain’t...Anyhow, the festering tensions between the diverse factions trapped (for most of the film) inside a supermarket and the inherent suspense present in the group’s generally unsuccessful excursions on the “outside” are skillfully handled and, despite the anonymity of the actors involved, some of the townspeople are blessed with full-blooded characterizations, most prominently Marcia Gay Harden (as the unbalanced, ultra-religious spinster who, after being derided for the longest time, manages to whip the crowd into a veritable frenzy when things start to go very badly for the heroic few) and William Sadler (as a bigoted redneck who cracks up after having a close encounter with the bugs and witnessing the extensiveness of their devastation).",7,0,1,23 April 2008
Stardust," STARDUST (Matthew Vaughn, 2007) ***
","I was only vaguely aware of the film when it came out but became interested in catching up with it after being bowled over by Vaughn's KICK-ASS (ditto for his debut LAYER CAKE [2004], which I have just rented). In retrospect, it is one of the best fairy-tales of recent memory – though it does not quite possess the vision of a Tim Burton.The director in any case has managed to rope in a great, eclectic cast: the ladies seem especially well-chosen – though both Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer are clearly past their prime, they still deliver as a fallen star assuming human form and a wizened sorceress seeking to restore her beauty; the others are LAYER CAKE's Sienna Miller as the obligatory snobbish town belle and Kate Magowen as a bewitched princess. Incidentally, Vaughn apparently likes to work with the same people – such as the afore-mentioned Miller and Mark Strong (though now becoming rather typecast in villainous roles). His siblings-turned-ghosts include Rupert Everett and Jason Flemyng (Calibos from CLASH OF THE TITANS [2010]); actually, it was sheer coincidence that I would watch this right after that one and ROBIN HOOD (2010), in which Strong appears as well, having rented the STARDUST DVD for the best part of a month! Robert De Niro is featured in one of his most bizarre characterizations as a literally gay pirate, though it is one of the film's ultimate drawbacks – exposing a certain lack of cohesion – that his entire subplot could be dropped without the narrative losing anything (as it is, at 128 minutes, this definitely feels overlong though never boring). Peter O'Toole turns up briefly, too, at the start as a dying sovereign.Having a wimp bloom into manhood through a series of extraordinary adventures also seems to be a prime concern for director Vaughn; consequently, here, bland hero Charlie Cox is involved in many a scrape – peppered with laughs, thrills, romance and menace – capped by a doozy of a climax (which even sees a corpse contracting a' la the EVIL DEAD movies). The whole makes for a most enjoyable ride, one which I consider worthy of a cult following.",7,1,2,25 May 2010
Kick-Ass," KICK-ASS (Matthew Vaughn, 2010) ***1/2
","If not for the high recommendation from a Maltese film-buff friend of mine a couple of days ago, I would probably have skipped an immediate viewing of this unheralded gem of a comic-strip spoof at the local cinema and waited for it to become available as a DVD rental; for the record, that same guy had loathed Zach Snyder's epic superhero movie WATCHMEN (2009) which I had really dug myself only recently...so, even if I decided to follow his advice, I had my reservations on just how right he could be! Needless to say, judging by my uncharacteristically high rating for a contemporary genre film, my final verdict on KICK-ASS was in complete agreement with the latter's – who, incidentally, had also opined that 'Quentin Tarantino would turn green with envy when he watches this'! Again, his comments were absolutely spot-on because here we also have a movie that is at once informed by – as well as being an analysis of – pop culture: naturally, in this case, the superhero/comic-strip phenomenon. But while in Tarantino's movies such wordy diatribes come off as vain show-offs by its fanboy writer-director by having them incongruously uttered by professional hit men or attractive chicks, in KICK-ASS they sound perfectly natural because it is nerdy schoolboys who deliver this kind of dialogue! Another Tarantinoesque trademark lifted wholesale (and utilized well) is the presence of an eclectic soundtrack, since throughout this movie we are treated to samples from Ennio Morricone's 'For A Few Dollars More', 'The Banana Splits' (one of my favorite TV shows from my long-gone childhood days!) and even the music playing over the opening credits of the 'Masters Of Horror' TV-series. Anyway, the men behind this brilliantly disarming piece of entertainment were also fairly unknown to me: original source writer Mark Millar had already been the creator of WANTED (2008) and director Matthew Vaughn had made the British crime thriller LAYER CAKE (2004; starring a pre-James Bond Daniel Craig) and STARDUST (2007; with Robert De Niro, Peter O'Toole, etc.); for what it is worth, I intend to track them all down in the coming days. Equally unknown and impressive was the young cast: Aaron Johnson (a Keith Gordon lookalike) is Kick-ass, 12-year old Chloe Moretz (soon to be seen in Matt Reeves' Hollywood remake of 2008's Swedish horror revelation LET THE RIGHT ONE IN) practically steals the show as the foul-mouthed, ass-kicking 'Hit-Girl'; Lyndsy Fonseca is the lovely object of desire quietly lusted after by Kick-ass' geeky everyday alter-ego (and whom he only manages to hook up with by falsely 'coming out'!), Mark Strong (as the town's leading mobster Frank D'Amico) and Chistopher Mintz-Plasse (as his overprotected kid who ingeniously lures Kick-ass into a deadly trap by dressing up as rival superhero 'Red Mist'). The film also manages to accomplish a near-superhuman feat all of its own when it made me like Nicolas Cage as 'Big Daddy' – Moretz' father and the one bona-fide article in the superhero stakes; Cage, an avowed comic-strip fan in real-life, had already appeared in the ludicrous GHOST RIDER (2007) next to Eva Mendeswith whom he has just appeared again in Werner Herzog's 2009 remake of THE BAD LIEUTENANT: PORT OF CALL – NEW ORLEANS which, it goes without saying, I want to check out despite its dubious intent!While the single biggest laugh-out-loud moment in KICK-ASS for me comes at the very start of the film (with the ill-fated flight of another false 'superhero') and the sequel-inviting ending seemed somewhat misjudged – I would much rather have had the kid commit hara-kiri when he found the samurai sword, leaving the film to be a veritable one-off oddity – it is the sheerly audacious political incorrectness (having the young Moretz spitting four-letter words and hack limbs left, right and center, not to mention being punched in the face and thrown around rooms herself!) that arguably makes KICK-ASS the coolest and most enjoyable superhero movie ever made! Hell, if this attitude catches on, now might make it the right time for me (and my twin brother) to unleash our own decade-old 'objectionable' script onto a more open-minded world...",8,3,11,10 April 2010
Shrek the Third," SHREK THE THIRD (Chris Miller and Raman Hui, 2007) **1/2
","I had enjoyed the first Shrek film due to its novelty but was somewhat lukewarm towards the second; I'm even more so, then, with respect to this new entry. It's still eminently watchable for the gags, the in-jokes and the apparently unlimited possibilities of the CGI technique. The best new character is surely Eric Idle's accident-prone Merlin, while the most amusing sequences are those involving the Frog King's death and Shrek's nightmare about his upcoming parenthood. However, its gang of gung-ho fairy-tale heroines and the generally modern attitudes on display – to say nothing of the typically refurbished pop/rock songs on the soundtrack (including, of all things, Led Zeppelin's 'Immigrant Song'!) – seem less intent on fulfilling the necessities of the plot than catering to potential box-office receipts!",6,0,1,15 July 2007
The Hurt Locker," THE HURT LOCKER (Kathryn Bigelow, 2008) ***1/2
","Presciently, I caught up with this on the same day as it emerged victorious at the Oscars. I had watched a few films about America's latest conflicts – BLACK HAWK DOWN (2001), JARHEAD (2005) and REDACTED (2007) – but, in spite of the little-known cast (apart from nice cameos by Ralph Fiennes and Guy Pearce), it is easily the best of the lot. Incidentally, I was familiar with only a few of Bigelow's previous efforts but I plan to make amends throughout this week: it is ironic, however, that for a woman to win an Oscar it took her making a man's kind of film! Anyway, echoing the feeling of some others here, I approached this with some trepidation believing it had nothing new to offer; to be sure, the idea of a reckless boffin was not really original (in fact, it has been a good 60 years since The Archers dealt with this very subject within a WWII context in THE SMALL BACK ROOM!) but, for a modern film, I admit it is well above average – while I am at it, I also intend to catch up with several titles of recent vintage I missed out on for whatever reason. I still need to check out AVATAR (2009), by the way – it is also scheduled for this week, hopefully along with James Cameron's Extended Version of THE ABYSS (1988) – but I was glad that the subtle, if all-important, work performed by the sound department on THE HURT LOCKER was recognized at the expense of the more bombastic{sic} aural experience that AVATAR is bound to be. To get back to the film under review, Jeremy Renner's showy role notwithstanding, it was also atypical – thus highly commendable – for the leading actor from a war film to elicit this kind of attentionbut, then, Christoph Waltz from INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS (2009) had it even better since he did win the Supporting award! The film's episodic nature results in many a tense situation (not least because the bomb-disposal unit's delicate job is forever being observed by the obviously disapproving and vaguely menacing locals) but also a few smaller moments (including Renner's relationship with a native boy) – all of which, however, are vital to the characterization (smoothing over some of its more predictable aspects) which, as already intimated, is what has singled this one out for praise (hence, the Best Original Screenplay Oscar win was just as deserving as the technical side of production). Finally, I found it highly refreshing that THE HURT LOCKER refrains from really taking sides in the conflict or become a blatantly anti-war film; on the contrary, it acknowledges the adrenalin rush that hardened war veterans get addicted to over time and are willing to sacrifice their lives (and sanity) to attain!",8,3,10,13 March 2010
The Illusionist," THE ILLUSIONIST (Neil Burger, 2006) ***
","Having recently been impressed by THE PRESTIGE (2006), I was looking forward to this similarly-themed film but, as often happens with rival productions, one always ends up towering over the other; in this case, it's THE PRESTIGE which emerges the superior film. Still, THE ILLUSIONIST provides plenty of visual interest (both films, interestingly enough, have been nominated for the Best Cinematography Oscar)  not least in the muted color palette and the magic tricks themselves (which, however, were more sparse than I had anticipated and rather too far-fetched into the bargain). However, compared to the dramatic hold and thematic bravado which distinguishes THE PRESTIGE, the stately film feels somewhat conventional: in fact, while I was expecting something on the lines of Ingmar Bergman's THE FACE (1958)  with a government official exposing a magician as a fraud and the latter's deadly retribution  all it ultimately amounted to was another impossible/undying love type of story; the final twist, however, is worth waiting for. Edward Norton gave his usual thorough performance, Jessica Biel was radiant as the romantic interest and Rufus Sewell rather monotonous as the crossed Prince  but it's Paul Giamatti who steals the film as the conflicted Police Inspector.",7,1,1,17 February 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer (Tim Story, 2007) **1/2
","While slightly superior to the original, this is still essentially bland and juvenile stuff  and entirely forgettable once it's over. The film is obviously a special effects bonanza and sees the emergence of a new anti-hero (as opposed to an out-and-out villain  that requirement is filled by the reappearance of the Four's old nemesis, Dr. Von Doom, with whom they're forced to collaborate in order to 'understand' the Silver Surfer!). Certainly the most novel and engaging element about the plot is the fact that, on contact with the alien, our superheroes are able to exchange 'gifts'. On the debit side, the Surfer's ominous ruler is a big disappointment when it finally makes its very belated appearance, the military personnel are pompous and downright obnoxious (ditto Chris Evans' relentless strutting and inane antics) but, thankfully, Jessica Alba is on hand to provide the redeeming and expected eye candy.",6,1,4,15 July 2007
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND (Hayao Miyazaki, 1984) ***
","As with Miyazaki's other fantasies - such as CASTLE IN THE SKY (1986) and HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE (2004) - the film (based on a graphic novel) takes in a rather unwieldy and muddled narrative which goes on too long! Needless to say, the animator's imagination is most evident in the epic-scale production design - and this is complemented by regular composer Joe Hisaishi's appropriately sweeping score (inevitably fused with then-fashionable synthesizer sounds).As usual, we get a plethora of characters and factions - both human and anthropomorphic: still, while the heroine is fairly well-delineated (if unexpectedly underclothed!) and the monsters typically impressive (and revolting), her animal companion is severely under-used and the villains prove to be not all that interesting. In essence, what we get here is plenty of action, a touch of magic (it's interesting how in all of Anime', children seem to posses some kind of power which places the fate of mankind in their hands) and a plea for ecological preservation.",7,2,5,15 March 2007
Transformers," TRANSFORMERS (Michael Bay, 2007) ***
","Being familiar with the original cartoon series of the 1980s, I was interested in catching the Hollywood live action blockbuster version. Basically, this turns out to be a combination of THE TERMINATOR (1984), INDEPENDENCE DAY (1996) and even BLACK HAWK DOWN (2001). As was to be expected for a modern day popcorn flick, teenagers are involved but, luckily, the two leads (despite their anonymity to the undersigned) were unusually affectingalthough, in the second half of the show, they too are eventually sidetracked by all the spectacle.Surprisingly enough, the villainous Decepticons are severely underused and their leader Megatron himself doesn't appear until the last half-hour or so! In fact, the most notable of the evil machines is a new addition to the fold – a hacker robot who grunts and gesticulates like a Gremlin! Also unexpected is the film's comic highlight set in the hero's backyard which sees the benign Autobots attempting to hide from the latter's overly inquisitive parents.For all the spectacular CGI-infested action sequences, the look of the machines themselves is rather cluttered – would we have been as impressed with the original King Kong if we couldn't see the mechanism at work? – and the fast and furious pace of the action sequences becomes numbing after a while: imagine the chariot race in BEN-HUR (1959) where the crucial antagonism between him and Messala is all but lost in the shuffle! Also, aren't we all tired by now to see every disaster to hit the planet nowadays being given the paranoid 9/11 spin – with the resulting affirmation of the ingenuity and superiority of the U.S. Defense system (even if they require the services of the world's top teenage hackers to crack the alien code)? Anyway, this is not a film to break down and analyze but one to take your breath away with awesome special effects and, in this regards, it succeeds well enough; for what it's worth, the human cast, apart from the afore-mentioned teenage leads, includes Jon Voight as the Secretary of Defence and John Turturro as an oddball member of a mysterious government agency.",7,0,2,6 September 2007
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK (George Clooney, 2005) ***1/2
","Having now watched all 5 of the Best Picture Oscar nominees, I can better judge whether the awards were truly distributed according to merit, i.e. whether I agree with who the winners were on the night of the ceremony. Well, at this stage, the first thing that's evident to me is that the two films that received the most (and most coveted) awards are, in fact, the ones that I found least satisfactory, i.e. CRASH and BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN! While CAPOTE and MUNICH are both fine pieces of work, the film that I feel really should have won  and, having been left empty-handed on awards night, means that it was well and truly snubbed!  is, in fact, George Clooney's second stab at directing (I've missed out on his debut CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND [2002] and, I guess, I should make it a point now to check that one out)! Barely over 90 minutes in length and shot on a low budget in black-and-white (the gleaming cinematography is first-rate), it really harks back to the hard-hitting American cinema of the 50s and 60s  and, for me, that's quite an achievement in itself! Even if Clooney himself ended up the winner of the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for SYRIANA (which I haven't watched yet), I feel that his direction was a lot more focused  and, well, interesting  than that of Ang Lee for BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN; likewise, while Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote deserved all the praise that was showered on it (a fact which I commented on in my recent review of that film), I also feel that David Strathairn's performance as another real-life celebrity  Edward R. Murrow  was even more impressive (if anything, because it was understated as opposed to showy) and, for lack of a better word, iconic.Dealing with one of the most fascinating  and painful  events in American political history, the film utilizes ample stock footage to throw us back into (rather than merely recreate) the paranoia that swept the country in the Cold War era, though attention must be paid for the narrative to be followed in detail. While Strathairn (in the role of a lifetime) is the nominal lead, the film actually features an ensemble cast that includes Clooney himself, Patricia Clarkson, Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Daniels and, most welcome of all, wonderful bits  in pivotal roles  by Frank Langella (as the long-suffering head of CBS, producer of Murrow's McCarthy-bashing programme) and Ray Wise (as Murrow's fellow journalist who cracks under the strain of the Anti-Communist persecution).",8,0,0,6 May 2006
Mulholland Drive," MULHOLLAND DRIVE (David Lynch, 2001) **1/2 SPOILER
","I had failed to watch this at the cinema when it was first released here, so I had to wait till it turned up on local TV. Once again, a much-touted David Lynch offering ends up doing very little for mebut, at least, Angelo Badalamenti's score was good!First of all, what's with that horrid opening? I was just about to give up on it when the plot got on its wayand, in any case, I was genuinely anxious to find out what all the fuss was about. In the end, it was Naomi Watts who made the film for me: baring her soul in a multi-layered (and highly emotional) performance; she is particularly effective during her sexy audition sequence.I do feel that MULHOLLAND DRIVE is a vast improvement on the director's LOST HIGHWAY (1997) but, for me, David Lynch's films provide a puzzle that is simply not worth unraveling (after taking an eternity to get there)! Suffice to say that the only wholly satisfying film of his I've seen is his one 'mainstream' venture  THE ELEPHANT MAN (1980) Despite Lynch's would-be surrealistic touches, he does not have Roman Polanski's eye for capturing the reality of the human condition in such abnormal circumstances. Consequently, his films end up being pretentious and self-indulgent bores!Back to the film in question; some of the detail IS amusing  Ann Miller's presence (God knows what she was thinking!); the robbery-gone-wrong sequence; the bigwigs' intimidation of the young director at various stages of the film's first half; the scene at the café (with another baffling and completely irrelevant anecdote involving some sort of a monster!)  but, for the life of me, it all seems to be jumbled together without any apparent rhyme or reasonwhich goes a long way in explaining my frustration with Lynch's work as a whole! On the other hand, the brief erotic scenes between the two women are sensitively handled and do not go overboard (unlike the tasteless and over-sexed LOST HIGHWAY).The twist ending, again, is not so shocking as Lynch probably intended: for one thing, far too many recent films have presented us characters facing an identity crisis or otherwise lost in some 'alternate' reality. In this case, when the whole mystery transpires to be a lesbian's suicide in desperation over being jilted by her Hollywood-star girlfriend, really all I could say was 'SO FU**ING WHAT?!'",Null,4,8,17 October 2004
Saw II," SAW II (Darren Lynn Bousman, 2005) **
","SAW (2003) was a modest, effective and innovate undertaking which seemed to please a lot of people at the time. On the contrary, the obligatory sequel is excessive in practically every way: an excess of victims (we have 8 against the first's 2), an excess of bad acting and unintentional humor (the drug-dealer character is especially guilty of both here), an excess of clichés and an excess of stupid dialogue.The only reason to keep watching is the expected (and gratuitous) display of sadism and the shameless borrowing from older (and better) films: we have a police detective who frames suspects to bring them to justice (a' la Hank Quinlan in Orson Welles' TOUCH OF EVIL [1958]), a psychopath who lures a S.W.A.T. team into a deadly trap (SPEED [1994]), a psychopath who punishes other 'sinners' for throwing their lives away (SEVEN [1995]) and, most perversely, a terminally-ill patient deciding to take stock of his remaining days, spend them on a useful purpose thus justifying his existence and, ultimately, ensure that he is remembered after he's gone (Akira Kurosawa's IKIRU [1952])!! This time around, however, even the 'twist' ending (which packed such a wallop in SAW) doesn't work because the incongruity of a character's abduction (given that she had already been a victim of the same psychopath in the first film) gives her easily away to perceptive viewers.",5,1,3,16 March 2006
From Dusk Till Dawn," FROM DUSK TILL DAWN (Robert Rodriguez, 1996) **1/2
","This is another film I'd been wanting to watch ever since it was released. As some of you may know, I'm not much of a devotee of Quentin Tarantino - even less so Robert Rodriguez - and my main interest in it was to see how they approached the horror genre. I wasn't all that surprised to find that it's much more of a Tarantino/Rodriguez hybrid of cool dialogue, excessive violence, foul language and slam-bang action than an out-and-out vampire film! Anyway, the first half (which is the non-horror part, incidentally) is the best with George Clooney and Tarantino himself (still a worthless actor and mean as mush) on the run after a heist and kidnapping Harvey Keitel's preacher and family on their way to Mexico. When we finally get to the vampires, it's like the film-makers didn't quite know what to make of them and wanted to get it over with - as we only see a succession of humans getting bitten and transformed into the undead themselves, until dawn arrives and the vampires left standing are destroyed by sunlight.Tarantino gets to wear monster make-up and an embarrassed-looking Harvey Keitel dabbles in gung-ho action heroics - but this section does feature a delightful double-act in fx master Tom Savini (playing a character called 'Sex Machine' and decked-out with a cannon device in his pants placed on top of his crotch!) and former 'Blaxpoitation' star Fred Williamson. For the record, Clooney is likable as ever, Juliette Lewis does her typically confused yet aroused teenager, while Salma Hayek is a sultry snake dancer billed as 'Santanico {sic} Pandemonium' (but her appearance is much shorter than I had anticipated, given the prominence she is given in stills I had seen from the film!).",6,0,2,22 October 2006
Clash of the Titans," CLASH OF THE TITANS (Louis Leterrier, 2010) **1/2
","When I first heard about this one, I was not enthused – not just in view of Hollywood's lamentable obsession with remakes (and it no longer even matters whether the original was successful, or for that matter any good, to begin with!) but also because the 1981 film had been partly shot over here in Malta and had been among my very first trips to the cinema! In retrospect, the result is more or less the equal but certainly not preferable to it – especially when pitting the earlier version's charming stop-motion technique vs. today's over-reliance on CGI; for all the progress in the art of visual effects, nothing they came up with here can be compared with Ray Harryhausen's still-amazing creatures from the original: especially lacking in this regard are the none-too-scary Medusa and the absurdly ALIEN-like Kraken dispatched in no time at all during the climax! Sam Worthington in the lead role of Perseus comes across as appropriately stoic but still miscast, given that his mannerisms are all-too-modern! Liam Neeson, then, is imposing as Zeus and Ralph Fiennes a menacing Hades (though some of the latter's over-the-top antics brought to mind those cheesy effects-laden flops from my childhood days – namely BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA, HOWARD THE DUCK and THE GOLDEN CHILD {all 1986})!; incidentally, watching this, I completely forgot these two actors had already appeared together in SCHINDLER'S LIST (1993).The new CLASH OF THE TITANS is oddly compact (running 12 minutes shorter than the 1981 film), so that it then ends up feeling somewhat undernourished as a narrative! For one thing, I did not approve of the various plot changes: why should Hades (who does not even figure in the original) hold dominion over the Kraken when it is a creature of the seas, hence Poseidon's territory (played here by a barely-glimpsed Danny Huston – which goes for the other Olympian gods as well)?! Similarly, Calibos' role is diminished in favor of Hades (not to mention, sporting a far less terrifying guise than Neil McCarthy's in the original) and, in the same vein, Perseus gets a fellow demi-goddess for a lover (Gemma Arterton as new character Io rather than Princess Andromeda – again, greatly undermining the latter's stature and Perseus' interest in his quest to begin with!). Yet another novelty is the Gill Man-like creature(s) Perseus & Co. meet in the desert: with this and the tamed giant scorpions, one has almost begun to perilously tread 'Star Wars' terrain! And what to make of the hysterics of that insufferable high priest, inciting the people to human sacrifice in order to placate the wrath of the gods?! Mind you the film is more than adequate entertainment for the duration (with reasonable action sequences and a surprisingly good sense of a devastated world) but it is also not particularly memorable or rewarding – unlike the earlier version which, furthermore boasted a majestic music score that finds no equal here. In this respect, it is telling that the only previous effort I had watched from director Leterrier was the likewise unoriginal (if slightly better) THE INCREDIBLE HULK (2008)",6,1,1,25 May 2010
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Charlie And The Chocolate Factory **1/2
","As if the mere fact that even today's major Hollywood film-makers - Tim Burton, The Coen Brothers, Steven Spielberg, Oliver Stone - have resorted to remaking earlier successes was not alarming enough, here we also have a remake which, despite being helmed by a vastly more talented director than the original's anonymous Mel Stuart, proves to be much less appetizing (pun intended). The thing is that, while the remake has all the visual flourishes and outrageous production design synonymous with its idiosyncratic director, it is fatally compromised by the distinctly unsympathetic characterization given by Johnny Depp (ironically, my favorite actor working in films today) in the all-important role of the reclusive Willy Wonka. While I haven't read the Roald Dahl book myself, so I can't really say with any measure of accuracy which of the two characterizations - Gene Wilder's in the 1971 original or Depp's in the remake - is the closer to Dahl's conception of Wonka, it goes without saying that Wilder's is the winner here. All in all, in fact, although I didn't enjoy that film on second viewing as much as I did the first, I prefer Wilder's version in practically every department. Also, while I did get used to the bizarrely 'modern' musical numbers as the film progressed, I don't think they were really suited to the material. The appearance of Christopher Lee as Depp¡¦s dentist father was a welcome addition, though, and in a way his scenes helped make some of Wonka's eccentricities more palatable. In conclusion, while Burton's remake of WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY wasn't as disastrous as his 2001 version of PLANET OF THE APES, which was decidedly his nadir, here's hoping that he gets back to concocting his own original visions before long.",5,8,14,23 February 2006
The Dark Knight," THE DARK KNIGHT (Christopher Nolan, 2008) ***
","Apart from the usual summer blockbuster expectations, this film acquired an instant mythical aura all its own following Heath Ledger's untimely demise (which inevitably borders on overhype). As long-rumored, Ledger's portrayal of The Joker is electrifying and leaves one in no doubt of the late actor's talent and versatility; still, though undeniably creepy – especially given his penchant for macabre TV appearances – he lacks the flamboyance (even if he does get to appear in drag!) and sense of fun that The Joker of Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson and even the animated series possessed! Besides, I don't understand why he's seen constantly recruiting henchmen from the other Gotham gangs when the film-makers chose to depict him as such a manic, trigger-happy thug that he does practically all of the shooting himself – with his anonymous lackeys being there merely to get treacherously shot in the back or hand him weapons! And what's up with leaving him dangling from a stairwell? It's not like he's coming back in the inevitable third entry, no? Incidentally, I feel that all the ongoing talk of posthumously awarding Ledger an Oscar in tribute is premature. By the way, the fact that the film is currently topping the all-time 250 list on IMDb – not that I ever cared for that particular list myself, mind you – is, quite frankly, ridiculous! While I can't really complain of it ever being slow, the film's 152-minute running-time is definitely excessive and could easily have been thinned down by as much as 45 minutes if some of the less interesting vignettes were dropped altogether: among the many needlessly intricate subplots, the chief offenders were the whole Asian financier segment, the dead-end assault on the Japanese skyscraper full of hostages and the climactic 'confrontation' between the two respective shiploads of evacuated citizens and jailbirds. Personally, I don't understand why the film-makers chose to divide the time between the Scarecrow (albeit a mere cameo from Cillian Murphy but welcome nonetheless), the mobsters, The Joker and Two-Face rather than devote a leaner (if consequently less ambitious) narrative to the most famous of Batman's opponents – as indeed Tim Burton's 1989 revival of the caped crusader had itself done. At the very end, I also didn't get why tolerated vigilante Batman must suddenly become a hunted fugitive from the law for the good of Gotham – what for and on whose authority? Gary Oldman's final monologue was supposed to shed some light on this, I guess, but I didn't catch some of it because of the music drowning out the dialogue! The returning actors from the first film of this new franchise (Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman) have all grown nicely into their roles – especially Caine and Oldman (so much so that I was disappointed to see him get 'bumped off' half-way through); that said, Batman himself seemed to be merely engaged in action sequences or else make split-second appearances to make his latest report to Gordon; by the way, I too found his scowling demeanor irritating – which his raspy voice sometimes rendered inaudible! On the other hand, the new additions to the fold – Aaron Eckhart (as unlucky D.A. Harvey 'Two-Face' Dent) and his gushing secretary Maggie Gyllenhaal (replacing Katie Holmes) – were less impressive (and their relationship equally dreary and time-consuming), which is just as well since both their characters lose their lives by the end of it (or so we are led to believe); Two-Face was supposed to be another criminal mastermind but, here, all he seems to care about is avenge his lover's death! Incidentally, I never thought I'd say this, but I enjoyed seeing Eric Roberts playing the meaty supporting role of one of Gotham's leading mobsters.Where special effects are concerned, the spectacular capsizing of the trailer was the film's most breath-taking moment and Two-Face's CGI-animated facial decomposition was not too distracting under the circumstances (reminding one of Griffin Dunne from AN American WEREWOLF IN London [1981]). Those of you who've read thus far may be questioning my eventual *** rating but, seriously, I did enjoy the film and there were certainly several good sequences and performances in it but, overall, in the words of George Harrison, 'it's all too much'",7,4,15,30 July 2008
Blood Diamond," BLOOD DIAMOND (Edward Zwick, 2006) ***
","This film created some controversy when it emerged because it exposed the grim realities behind the diamond industry. Combining action, politics, romance and star power, BLOOD DIAMOND is well-made but essentially manipulative and sentimental; one even begins to doubt its intentions, whether it was genuinely made to raise awareness of the situation in South African diamond-mines or film-wise exploit their novelty and scoop value! Leonardo Di Caprio is saddled with a silly accent - I personally found his performance in THE DEPARTED (2006) more impressive; Jennifer Connelly is pretty good, but her character seems like a glamorized version of a modern female reporter; as for Djimon Honsou, his undeniably heartfelt performance too often translates into grating hysterics. The rambling narrative sags alarmingly in its third act and, in any case, the film is full of the hand-held carnage we've been suffering from for the last decade or so! It's been a week since I've watched BLOOD DIAMOND and, honestly, I can find nothing more appreciative to say about it which would justify my relatively high rating. Let's just say that it's a good film coming from today's Hollywood - but, as with most modern product, it's something I don't really need to ever revisit...",6,1,4,18 May 2007
Grindhouse," GRINDHOUSE (Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, 2007) ***
","Yesterday's whining about missing out on these discussions proved premature, because I eventually managed to get hold of a DivX copy of the film in a matter of hours! It may not be the ideal medium to fully appreciate the GRINDHOUSE experience  especially in view of the cropped picture and muffled audio  but, for the moment, it was enough to tide me over; at least, I was able to get an inkling of what the film is like since, as I said before, there's no announced local release date as yet.Anyway, I have to say that on the whole I was underwhelmed by it all: like Joe Karlosi, individually I'd rate the Rodriguez segment **1/2 and Tarantino's ***. Still, I'm sure it's better to watch them as a double-feature because neither of the two parts really add up to much on their own. After all, that is the whole nostalgic spirit of grindhouse it is trying to celebrate complete with cheesy trailers, two 90 minute B-movies back-to-back, scratched prints, audio drop-outs, missing reels, etc. I have only watched a handful of grindhouse movies myself  4 of which were introduced by Tarantino himself (together with Joe Dante) during a marathon midnight screening at the 2004 Venice Film Festival.To get to the film(s) proper now: I've watched little of Robert Rodriguez's movies so far and I wasn't that much taken by them and his 'Planet Terror' is an extremely gory zombie flick which, as mindlessly enjoyable as it is while it's on, essentially brings nothing new to the table. It's as much a virtual retread of his own FROM DUSK TILL DAWN (1996) as a nod to the zombie films of George Romero, Lucio Fulci et al. The cast is a mix of young actors and grindhouse/action-movie veterans: Rose McGowan is ideally cast as the heroine who finds inspired use for her leg when it's amputated after being bitten off and Marley Shelton leaves a good impression as a harassed needle-sporting doctor  but then Freddy Rodriguez is a non-entity as McGowan's ex-boyfriend; the rest include Josh Brolin as Shelton's crazed surgeon husband, Tom Savini as a distraught cop, Michael Biehn as his superior, Jeff Fahey as a bartender, Michael Parks (reprising his sheriff role from the KILL BILL [2003/4] films!), Bruce Willis as a shady military official and Tarantino himself (who keeps inflicting his imaginary thespian skills on moviegoers despite the resulting sabotage of his appearances) as an obnoxious orderly of Willis'so his stomach-turning demise was particularly welcome! Quentin 'Look, I'm an artist, alright' Tarantino's 'Death Proof' is potentially intriguing: while Rodriguez's aim seems to have been to merely replicate the dumb thrills of typical grindhouse efforts, Tarantino's segment  frustrating though it is  comes off more like a reflection on this particular style of film-making (and the road movie/car chase variety in particular), with little plot and a lot of mood-setting. But, unfortunately, Tarantino is too much in love with his own dialogue and there are reams of utterly uninteresting chick chatter between the two sets of girls which makes for a rather dull ride (no pun intended) and I pretty much gave up on listening to the actual banter after vainly trying to sort out any substance from all the expletives! Some of the girls (Vanessa Ferlito and Sydney Tamiia Poitier) look good, thankfully, but I have to ask what they were doing mouthing off would-be hip references to cult 'car' films of the 1970s or wondering what turn Pete Townshend's career would have taken had he left The Who?! All of which makes Tarantino's claims that 'Death Proof' contains his best dialogue exchanges ever and that he is in the same league as Preston Sturges and Mark Twain as a writer ludicrously egomaniacal. Luckily, Kurt Russell is on hand to lend some much-needed gravitas to the proceedings; interestingly, his character goes through quite a surprising change throughout the course of 'Death Proof' (and I agree wholeheartedly with Michael Elliott that the two halves of this section actually happened in reverse). However, where this segment really scores is in the action sequences  alternately shocking (the repeated collision sequence and McGowan's vicious murder), thrilling (the car chase) and crowd-pleasing (Russell's come-uppance) rather than merely pure slam-bang as in 'Planet Terror' (in spite of all its purposeful political incorrectness) - which really elevates Tarantino's piece above that of Rodriguez. Having said that, it's still not quite up to the level of his earlier work (for instance, the KILL BILL saga  which is the closest to it in feel and approach  is much better) and I'd say this is Tarantino's weakest effort to date.In conclusion, another head-scratcher for me was that, in spite of all the admirable effort (mentioned above) on the part of the film-makers to replicate the grindhouse 'feel', the stories themselves were then set in modern-day America (cue the needlessly regular use of CGI effects in Rodriguez's section and that of mobile phones in Tarantino's) which, for me, rather defeated the purpose. The eclectic bunch of trailers (contributed by Eli Roth, Edgar Wright, Rob Zombie and Rodriguez himself) are campy fun and an inspired addition to this decidedly mixed bag.",6,3,12,14 April 2007
Groundhog Day," GROUNDHOG DAY (Harold Ramis, 1993) ***
","While I had always been aware of this film's considerable reputation, it took me this long to get acquainted with it; in retrospect, I feel the picture to be deserving of the epithet 'modern comedy classic'. It deals with an original – and for the genre, singular – concept: a literal case of multiple deja'-vu experiences (in all fairness, the minor sci-fi entry THE TIME TRAVELERS [1964] had already delved into the theme, though obviously lacking the skill and polish realized here). Bill Murray tackles one of his best roles, actually a variation on the actor's own characterization in the much inferior SCROOGED (1988), which I watched only last week; now he is an arrogant (can he play any other way?) Weather Man assigned to the unexciting titular event in Pennsylvania – eager to get out of there, he not only finds the passage blocked by a snowstorm but, by some unexplained quirk of nature, finds himself reliving the same day over and over again! At first, he is understandably baffled and frustrated by all of this – especially in the face of the obliviousness to his predicament shown by colleagues and townspeople alike; then, he is amused by the sheer predictability of the day's proceedings; gradually, however, he learns to take advantage of this state-of-affairs – not only involving himself in the everyday life of the town, but also striving to better himself (such as becoming an accomplishment piano-player or a hand-craft artisan seemingly in the space of single day); most of all, however, he works at cultivating a loving relationship with Andie McDowell, the producer of his TV program who, normally, cannot stand him! Apparently, Murray and director Ramis (co-stars in STRIPES [1981], another recent viewing, and the GHOSTBUSTERS films) fell out during the making of this one because they had contrasting opinions about the prevailing tone of the script: Murray wanted it to be of a more philosophical bent, while Ramis thought better of extracting the comic potential out of the central situation; in the end, I feel the film strikes a good balance between the two (with plenty of visual gags and assorted mayhem but, at the same time, having a definite bittersweet side to it – in view of the above-mentioned budding romance and also Murray's numerous failed suicides!).",7,0,4,24 January 2010
The Descent," The Descent (2005) ***
","Marshall improves on the promise shown in his earlier DOG SOLDIERS (2002) with this nail-biting sleeper. After a slowish start in a belated female DELIVERANCE (1972) mode, the film piles on the shocks and the gore with unfaltering expertise. The all-female cast members are relative newcomers, a factor which adds immeasurably to their vivid portrayal of women out of their league fighting the elements, the supernatural and, at times, themselves. It is to the director's credit that he deliberately withholds the appearance of the 'Crawlers' (with their creepily effective Graf Orlok-like make-up) for as long as he does; if I were to nitpick, I would say that I would have liked for them to have been given a different 'voice' - which to me sounded far too similar to that of the creatures in Guillermo Del Toro's MIMIC (1997). The surprise, downbeat, open-ended 'twist' ending, then, is ultimately the natural progression to the relentless grimness of what has gone on before.",7,4,10,11 February 2006
Inside Man," INSIDE MAN (Spike Lee, 2006) ***
","This is only my third Spike Lee movie (the others being DO THE RIGHT THING [1989] and MALCOLM X [1992]), but I'd say that it's his most atypical film to date - a very enjoyable and smartly-written thriller which, thankfully, does not take itself too seriously and besides features a good cast in fine form (Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster, the latter cast against type, are particularly impressive). The throwback half-way through to MARATHON MAN (1976) territory is unexpected and not totally convincing, however, especially since Clive Owen's real motives are kept from the spectator. There's the occasional caper/police procedural cliché, too, to be sure - but, overall, the film manages to work around them in clever and original ways. Also, while the film deals with Washington's family life from time to time, it's mercifully left in the background and doesn't get in the way of the main plot. Lee's direction is needlessly flashy at times, but one can't really blame him for playing the Hollywood game when given a big budget and a specific genre to work in.",7,1,2,13 February 2007
The Da Vinci Code," THE DA VINCI CODE (Ron Howard, 2006) **1/2
","Given all the controversy surrounding the film, the end result couldn't help being a disappointment - but, coming from Howard, I had no real expectations anyway! The premise is intriguing in itself - personally, I wasn't bothered by its questioning of Christ's divinity and the possibility that a descendant of his may still be alive - but the plot is simply too complex to be absorbed in a single viewing (I never read Dan Brown's novel).Reportedly, it's a pretty faithful adaptation of the source material but this results in a lot of padding (too many stops for exposition, including needless character development) and, consequently, gross overlength for what should essentially be a gripping conspiracy thriller. With regards to performances, while I'm not usually a fan of Tom Hanks I didn't mind him all that much here (although his hairstyle was an eyesore!), liked Audrey Tatou and Ian McKellen was typically imposing - but the rest (Jean Reno, Alfred Molina and especially a ludicrous turn from Paul Bettany) were quite boring! What had been the film's most discussed sequence prior to its release - Jesus' wedding, actually shot in Malta - was barely seen in the released version! I wonder if there was any pressure on the film-makers for this scene to be removed and, hopefully, it will be included as part of an eventual DVD edition...",5,5,11,2 June 2006
Thor," THOR {3-D} (Kenneth Branagh, 2011) ***
","This is as solid a Marvel Comics superhero flick as we have come to expect. While I cannot say to have been much enthused when it was first announced (in view of my unfamiliarity with lead Chris Hemsworth), I kept the faith given the involvement of director Branagh – which is not too surprising since he treats the larger-than-life proceedings as if they were a Shakespearean tragedy (which made his reputation to begin with) and, in any case, he had already dabbled in fantasy with the interesting if overblown MARY SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN (1994). In hindsight, this proved almost as refreshing as IRON MAN (2008) where, similarly, the human element had emerged in spite of the predictable barrage of action (notably a battle sequence early on) and special effects (the look of Asgard is impressive alright, yet the 3-D is – as ever – sparingly adopted throughout, thus not justifying the ticket-price increase!).Though the lead looks nothing like the cartoon character I used to watch as a kid, he manages most of the aspects pertaining to this legendary Scandinavian deity – his pride, his passion, his confidence, his charm and, of course, his strength (augmented by Hemsworth's physically-fit appearance). Thor's family circle includes Anthony Hopkins as Odin, his father (who can always be relied upon for such grandiose types, especially since he plays through much of this one-eyed), Rene Russo as the latter's wife (who, however, has precious little to do) and Tom Hiddleston as Thor's brother Loki who, discovering to be something other than what he had been led to believe, eventually becomes the hero's sworn enemy (even if his horn-fitted head-gear was, in itself, a giveaway to his true nature!). Also on hand are Thor's warrior companions (a mixed bunch of sexes, ethnicities and personalities, with the girl among them obviously having a yen for our hero!) who even follow the protagonist to Earth when Odin banishes him (stripped of his powers!) for disobeying his orders of keeping the peace with a neighboring (and, effectively made-up, vaguely monstrous) tribe.On Earth, we get the usual initial misunderstanding and clash of cultures, as Thor's fall from the heavens coincides with heroine Natalie Portman and crew's study of an atmospheric phenomena – they even run him over twice with their van (the comedy relief, especially as delivered by Portman's brainy-but-cute pal Kat Dennings, is quite endearing)! Before long, romance blossoms (believably), bureaucracy intervenes (in the form of SHIELD, the Superhero league which has been appearing intermittently throughout the Marvel Comics adaptations, getting its most sizeable part so far here – with not only a cameo by Jeremy Renner but the by-now-trademark appearance from Samuel L. Jackson, meeting up with Portman's elder associate Stellan Skarsgard, in the post-credits teaser: this one is quite intriguing and there is even an announcement that 'Thor will return in THE AVENGERS'!), while Loki usurps the throne and visits Thor to tell him their father is dead (which he is not, but this only increases the protagonist's guilt complex!).Anyway, Thor learns the truth from his friends and also sees Loki for what he really is. The hulking but wise Guardian of the passage between the two worlds also gets in on the action, though he is obviously no match for Loki; later, we also get a robot being sent to Earth to cause havoc (another fine set-piece) but, just then, Odin sees that Thor has learned his lesson and gives him back his powers (incidentally, he could not even dislodge his mighty hammer from where it fell and which had been appropriated by SHIELD along with Portman's personal notes!). In the end, Thor assures Portman he will returnbut the afore-mentioned bridge has to be destroyed during his showdown back home with Loki, in order to eradicate the latter, so Thor cannot keep his promise after all (though the scriptwriters are sure to find a way to resolve this issue and get them together again by the time the inevitable sequel comes along!).",7,0,2,18 May 2011
The Happening," THE HAPPENING (M. Night Shyamalan, 2008) **1/2
","One of my pet peeves has always been when movies have identical names but absolutely nothing else in common with each other; this is just such a case since, back in 1967, Elliot Silverstein had already directed Anthony Quinn and Faye Dunaway in a now-forgotten hippie kidnappers comedy which, incidentally, I’ve caught on Italian TV ages ago.Typically for M. Night Shyamalan’s recent movies, his latest offering was coolly received by both critics and audiences but I actually thought that, at least for the first hour, it was pretty good. Hell, even Mark Wahlberg gets better with each successive film I see him in – or at least seems more tolerable as a leading man here than in that deplorable PLANET OF THE APES remake from 2001! Like the director’s previous films THE VILLAGE (2004) and, to a lesser extent SIGNS (2002), this one also has an intriguing premise which is, however, marred by an unsatisfying denouement. In any case, the film’s would-be apocalyptic feel and the eventual discovery of its natural aggressor bring to mind equally modest (but vintage and decidedly superior) sci-fi outings like PANIC IN YEAR ZERO and THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS (both 1962).The belatedly introduced ‘redneck granny’ character was hard to take at times and, besides, as often happens to me while watching disaster movies, I break out in giggles every time there is depicted an event of mass hysteria (which come in droves here). One does wonder at this point, though, where Shyamalan’s career might possibly be headed since he has basically been stuck in the same allegorical/apocalyptic fantasy rut for far too long now…",5,3,7,6 July 2008

","As I was about to write this, I decided to re-read my review of Miyazaki's HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE (2004) - which I watched earlier this year - and I realized that what I had said about that film pretty much applies to this one as well, even if there's practically a 20-year gap between them (I guess the inference here is that this celebrated animator's style hasn't developed all that much in the interim, which is not necessarily a bad thing).To quote myself, then: 'a great showcase of the Japanese master's visionary genius; however, it also features his typical faults - to me, at least - of presenting an over-ambitious (and overly weird) plot line which, due to its excessive length, tends to overstay its welcome and ends up in being an overwhelming (if not necessarily memorable) visual experience! As usual, the detail is immaculate and the scale of the whole thing impressive'. Granted, the plot of LAPUTA isn't nearly as involved as some of Miyazaki's later work, though this is still far from a kiddie film - particularly in its climactic set-piece, where all parties concerned (the children, the sky pirates - whose hard exterior mellows gradually to reveal an essential softness underneath - and the army - whose leader, too, isn't what he seems to be) converge on the titular flying citadel, each having their own goal. It's evident, therefore, that characterization is not at all one-dimensional (though Miyazaki dispenses with anthropomorphism this time around) - while the robotic guardians of the island castle are strikingly designed, as well as suitably imposing; the score (by frequent Miyazaki collaborator Joe Hisaishi), too, emerges as a definite asset.To tie in with how I began this review, then, I believe that it's been my over-exposure to Anime on Italian TV as a kid which has diluted the overall impact that such feature-length efforts (and Miyazaki's films in particular) seem to have - pretty much unanimously - on audiences from other parts of the world...",7,0,3,18 December 2006
The Fountain," THE FOUNTAIN (Darren Aronofsky, 2006) **1/2
","This is an intriguing but muddled and, finally, undernourished fantasy with biblical pretensions – one that’s undeniably visually arresting, particularly since it skips from one time period to the other (15th century Spain, the present day and the future). Another major asset is the evocative score.Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz make up the affecting central couple: as a conquistador, he searches for the Tree Of Life (Weisz also plays the Spanish queen in this section); as a doctor, he races against time to find a cure for his dying wife – eventually obtaining immortality for himself (hence, the futuristic ‘episode’). Ellen Burstyn (who had been given a new lease of life by the same director’s REQUIEM FOR A DREAM [2000]) appears here as Jackman’s superior in the contemporary sequences.The film’s non-linear structure results in confusion during the first hour – but, slowly, the various plot threads come together; however, the ending is rather abrupt. The conquistador ‘segment’ constitutes the best section of the film, while the futuristic scenes seem to be reaching for a 2001-like abstractness!",6,3,8,18 July 2007
Zombieland," ZOMBIELAND (Ruben Fleischer, 2009) ***
","As I have often said, I am not too fond of the zombie genre (at least the flesh-eating variety), so I was not exactly looking forward to this one; however, knowing it had a strong sense of humor (zombies are lured out into the open by the strumming of 'Dueling Banjos'!), I was willing to make one more trip to the well. In fact, once one gets over the initial 'do we really need another zombie spoof?' feeling – especially keeping in mind the satirical elements in George A. Romero's vastly overrated original DAWN OF THE DEAD (1978) and, obviously, the equally ultra-hyped SHAUN OF THE DEAD (2004; which was voted 'best comedy of the decade' for cryin' out loud by the British magazine 'Empire'!) – ZOMBIELAND proves quite enjoyable most of the way. The film's second trump card is the (obviously human) characterization, not a typical asset in this sort of gory fare: here, in fact, we have two guys (geeky kid and gung-ho modern cowboy – the latter played by Woody Harrelson) and two girls (the younger being LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE [2006]'s Abigail Breslin) against the rest of the world, infected with some virus (as always) and thus appropriately dubbed 'Zombieland'. Despite its trim running time, the majority of the action occurs during the opening and concluding sections (with the creatures a blood-vomiting and often obese lot, one is actually thankful for it!); that said, the highlight is perhaps the hysterical scene at Bill Murray's estate (with the 'Ghostbusters' star appearing as himself and even becoming an unfortunate victim of the paranoia that understandably grips the normal segment of humanity). The remainder, as already intimated. is devoted to the budding relationship within the group – Harrelson takes on the kid against his better judgment but, then, both are repeatedly double-crossed by the girls (who had made a pact not to trust anyone); of course, at the end, they are happy to join forces and the teens even become romantically involved. New-hand director Fleischer brings plenty of style to the table and generally succeeds in breathing new life (no pun intended) into a by-now exhausted formula; by the way, who would have thought I would ever be hearing an all-too brief snippet of 'Oh! Sweet Nuthin'' by my beloved The Velvet Underground on the soundtrack of a zombie movie? Needless to say perhaps but a sequel to this one is already in the works",7,0,2,3 March 2010
The Departed," THE DEPARTED (Martin Scorsese, 2006) ***1/2
","I haven't watched the Asian original - though the 3-pack of the entire series has been available for rental forever at my local DVD outlet! - and, frankly, now that I've seen Scorsese's 'version' of them I don't really need to either!! For one thing, he manages to make the subject matter all his own: it's a veritable companion piece to MEAN STREETS (1973), GOODFELLAS (1990) and CASINO (1995). Still, I don't see this as an Oscar picture: much as I loved GANGS OF NEW YORK (2002) and THE AVIATOR (2004), I'm glad Scorsese has returned to more typical (and familiar) territory - and his stamp is all over this film, from the dynamic editing to the terrific soundtrack to the multi-layered violent-yet-likable characters (this has to be one of the most foul-mouthed mainstream films ever!).The cast is top-notch and, while I've never been enthralled before with the baby-faced trio of Leonardo Di Caprio, Matt Damon and Mark Walhberg, they're all extremely convincing here (with DiCaprio delivering his most De Niroesque performance yet); as for the veterans, they add authenticity to the material which could never happen by watching the originals, because the actors would be unfamiliar to us - Jack Nicholson (his best role in years) and Ray Winstone (though he seems to be stuck with this type of character!) are effortlessly menacing, while Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin are the image of integrity itself; lovely Vera Farmiga makes the most of her difficult role (the only female character of any consequence).There are flaws, however: the plot is quite convoluted and the film rather too long for its purpose (hell, it goes on for another half-hour after the Nicholson character is bumped off!) - culminating in an over-the-top, body-strewn climax (though the unexpected death of one of the leads is as shocking and powerful as Kevin Spacey's demise in L.A. CONFIDENTIAL [1997]).I haven't watched that many films this year, but this is easily the best so far.",8,1,3,22 October 2006
War of the Worlds," War Of The Worlds ***
","Although this may not have turned out to be the ultimate alien invasion movie everyone was expecting, it is still a spectacular, exciting and, at times, frightening version of H. G. Wells' famous sci-fi classic. I don't think that comparisons should really be made between this and the 1953 original (which, in itself, possesses a nostalgic charm totally absent from Spielberg's film) because of the enormous technological advances made in the special effects field but, in retrospect, it¡¦s interesting to note that both film versions of the novel can be seen as a Hollywood riposte to a recent catastrophic event which had hit the U.S. - the Cold War in the original and the attack on the Twin Towers in the remake; as a result - and thankfully so, I might add - Spielberg's approach to the material is refreshingly sober and intelligent, closer to that seen in SIGNS (2002) than the more jingoistic one adopted for INDEPENDENCE DAY (1996). Unfortunately, the anti-climactic 'happy ending' seems more suggestive that if you are Tom Cruise nothing bad can really happen to you, rather than the more truthful message that if the family unit stays together under times of great emotional stress, it will eventually pull through despite the hardships and the losses. That said, Tom Cruise is ideally cast as the not-so-ideal father figure and delivers the goods in that respect; however, while Dakota Fanning steals some of his limelight, her character - and especially that of her brother - were something of a liability, coming off as rather annoying and one-dimensional. Also, it was a nice touch on Spielberg's part to give bit parts to the 1953 version's original stars, Gene Barry and Ann Robinson, at the very end of the film but, as I said before, the ending was misjudged, in my opinion, if not necessarily a fatal mistake.",7,1,5,23 February 2006
12 Years a Slave," 12 YEARS A SLAVE (Steve McQueen, 2013) **1/2
","In December 2012, SHAME (2011) – the director's previous effort starring Michael Fassbender (who appears in this one as well) – was among the top contenders for the European Film Awards held here in Malta; I opted to watch it at the time, and recall not being exactly admiring of the end result. 12 YEARS A SLAVE, then, took McQueen to Hollywood and a theme presumably close to his heart (being a black man, despite his British pedigree) i.e. an ostensibly true account of slavery in the Deep South a few years before it was eventually abolished; on the other hand, Fassbender had already been featured in Quentin Tarantino's INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS (2009) – supporting Brad Pitt, who himself assumes a small role in the movie under review apart from co-producing it! Well, the film is slated to win a number of its nine Oscar nominations (including Best Picture!) come Sunday: the other nods being for Direction, Actor (a reasonably impressive Chiwetel Ejiofor), Supporting Actor (Fassbender incessantly hamming it up!), Supporting Actress (Lupita Nyong'o – whose hardly outstanding talent is only evident in a few instances!), Adapted Screenplay, Editing, Production Design (this category seems to be referred to as Art Direction/Set Decoration no longer!) and Costume Design. From my average rating, one can gauge that my reaction to this was lukewarm: there are several reasons for it but, chief among them, is the fact that, rather than seeming its own film, 12 YEARS A SLAVE feels like bits and pieces from older titles relating to the subject matter concerned (notably GOODBYE UNCLE TOM {1971}, MANDINGO {1975} and DJANGO UNCHAINED {2012}). However, none of these had mustered quite the level of gravitas that so wears McQueen's approach down – exemplified by various shots, songs (for what it is worth, the entire score tends towards over-emphasis) and even cries that linger on endlessly in its striving to make some point or other! – while also coming off in its copious whipping sequences as the most gloatingly sadistic mainstream release since THE PASSION OF THE Christ (2004)!! To which must be added its parade – a caricatured depiction, if ever there was one – of obnoxious 'white trash': not just behaving boorishly towards the slaves which they treat as property to be utilized in any way they deem fit (most reprehensibly by Fassbender's perpetually grumpy spouse, who throws a whiskey glass container in the face of hubby's favourite Nyong'o!) but proving Bible-thumping hypocrites into the bargain!! For the record, Ejiofor is the cultured and music-playing real-life protagonist (on whose book the script is based) – a free black man 'shanghaied' from New York to the Deep South, but ultimately reclaimed and returned to his family by a former 'master' – whereas Pitt turns up intermittently during the last third as a sympathetic carpenter (sporting an unbecoming Amish-type beard!) who likewise has a hand in the hero's renewed liberation; the extensive cast list also showcases the likes of Paul Giamatti and Benedict Cumberbatch.",6,2,6,28 February 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (Martin Scorsese, 2013) ***
","Considering its many affiliations with American HUSTLE (noted in that film's review), it is interesting to watch how in the former, the F.B.I. emerged as foolhardy in their undeniably well-meaning approach – while here they are treated more or less as the heroes of the day when their operation proves a resounding success! Anyway, much has been said of this latest Martin Scorsese/Leonardo Di Caprio collaboration – especially in how it treads the line of tastelessness for much of its 3 hour duration (with some of the admittedly over-the-top sex'n'drugs antics seeming to belong more in a grindhouse or even 'Euro-Cult' movie from the 1970s!). Still, I feel this backlash (especially for the way such serious offenses as depicted in the film are treated in blackly comic terms) was itself extreme: just note how much attention has been given to the dwarf-throwing gag (the pros and cons of such a wild scheme are amusingly delineated just like any other business-related item!) but, seeing how it occurs during the very opening scene, one would expect the viewer to have totally worked it out of his system by the time the picture's end credits start rolling! Indeed, to Scorsese's credit, if the Jordan Belfort gang's scamming of both poor and rich people was dealt with so thoroughly – or, should I say, the rewards they reaped from it – these characters' fall from grace is at least as detailed and spectacular; so, in that respect, it comes off as a balanced evaluation of a particular lifestyle which, like it or not, existsand to which gullible people themselves contribute in a misguided attempt to increase their own bank account without having to work for it!As for Di Caprio, his performance is indeed among the year's best and one of his own towering achievements – but, personally, I feel he was even better in THE AVIATOR (2004) and SHUTTER ISLAND (2010; for which he was not even Oscar-nominated!), both also for Scorsese. The film under review is up for just five Academy Awards, which rather shuts it out from winning any of the top categories – unless the AMPAS voters prefer the star to Matthew McConaughey in DALLAS BUYERS CLUB (another initially reprehensible real-life character dealing in illegal substances but, in his case, for the common good rather than self-gratification), which I sincerely doubt!; incidentally, McConaughey himself turns up here early on as the anti-hero's mentor and whose ritualistic hum to get him functioning on a daily basis is even worked into a song by the actor and the film's music director Robbie Robertson (ex-member of The Band and a Scorsese regular)! Jonah Hill as the protagonist's sidekick is also shortlisted in the Supporting Actor category but, while his contribution is highly entertaining, there is little depth to the part (even less so where their other colleagues are concerned, who somehow seem stuck in the lower rungs of the firm despite its obvious flourish!). Di Caprio's role – being based on the book written by Belfort himself – is clearly much more rounded, then, especially since his intermittent narration is adamant that money and power (even more so when acquired at a young age and unlawfully) too often lead one on a self-destructive pathand the fact that he was able to rise again after 'doing time' is a testament to his talent for survival, if nothing else! To go back to its ties with American HUSTLE, the F.B.I. sequences necessarily recall those of Scorsese's earlier and superior GOODFELLAS (1990) – which suggests that its best (and funniest) moments tend to involve the after-effects of the copious intake of drugs, notably DiCaprio getting tongue-tied during a vital telephone call and his 'spastic' attempts to reach his luxurious car and drive back home. For the record, film director Rob Reiner appears as Di Caprio's colourful dad and Jean Dujardin is a Swiss Bank manager (to where the countless millions are literally transferred out of the federal authorities' reach). On a personal note, I should say that I was expecting to hate this going in but I have had to eat my words and admit that it was an enjoyable if (no pun intended) taxing ride...which, as soon as it was over, made me run to the medicine cabinet and pop a headache pill myself!",Null,8,12,2 March 2014
The Last King of Scotland," THE LAST KING OF Scotland (Kevin MacDonald, 2006) ***
","Forest Whitaker deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar for his vivid portrayal of Ugandan dictator, General Idi Amin (even though newsreel footage at the end shows there is not that much of a facial resemblance), who starts out as being fairly benign but gradually turns to mass-murdering tyranny through his paranoia and mood swings. Showing the events from the viewpoint of his out-of-his-league Scottish physician was an innovation but, eventually, this drags the film into dreary melodramatics when the doc impregnates one of Amin's wives and, ultimately, serves to render the film unfocused and overlong.The film is certainly very well done and generally compelling but, once one realizes that the Scottish doctor is a fictional character, the viewer is left wondering whether the director (or the author of the book on which the script was based) opted to take a foreigner's eye-view of this turbulent period in South African history because otherwise the project would have had no commercial momentum! Not much barbarity is shown but, when it is, the results are quite chilling - such as the vivisected body of Amin's duplicitous wife and his hideous torture of the doctor practically in full view of the Entebbe hostages, scenes which wouldn't have been amiss in a horror film!",7,1,2,9 May 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," STRANGER THAN FICTION (Marc Forster, 2006) ***
","While I had greatly enjoyed  and admired  Forster's previous film, FINDING NEVERLAND (2004), it took some nudging from the owner of my local DVD rental outlet to catch this film! His turned out to have been good advice as I found it to be quirky, delightful, intelligent and original; somewhat in the vein of ADAPTATION (2002) but with a more optimistic outlook.I had never watched any of Will Ferrell's star vehicles before, but he really nailed every facet of his character here (and was thus a deserving Golden Globe nominee); similar care has been applied to the supporting cast: a charming Maggie Gyllenhaal, Dustin Hoffman (who had also appeared in FINDING NEVERLAND), a slightly overstated Emma Thompson and Queen Latifah (who, surprisingly, keeps a reasonably low profile throughout).Ultimately, though somewhat overlong, I feel that STRANGER THAN FICTION was perhaps more deserving of the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay than LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE (2006)except that it wasn't even nominated!  but, at least, the quality of Zach Helm's work has been recognized by being one of the 5 finalists for the WGA (Writers' Guild of America) award, while the National Board Of Review deemed it the year's best.",7,0,0,8 March 2007
The Wrestler," THE WRESTLER (Darren Aronofsky, 2008) ***1/2
","This year I have been slow in catching up with the major Oscar contenders before the big night itself and this is only the second one of them that I have seen; considering the hype which preceded this film (even here on this Forum) and fully knowing my own skepticism about contemporary fare, I was wary of having to face bitter disappointment once I got to it. The irony is that, in spite of the ultra-familiar central premise and theme (it's basically an indie version of ROCKY BALBOA [2006] but set in the world of Wrestling, about a has-been regaining self-respect and trying to sort out his personal life), the film still compels attention throughout  largely because it takes the character study route. It is certainly rare that an actor is given as direct an opportunity to invest a role with his own personal experiences but, in hindsight, all the praise showered on Mickey Rourke's comeback performance is well-deserved. However, his female co-stars Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood  playing the protagonist's girlfriend (an over-age stripper with a kid of her own) and estranged daughter respectively  aren't forgotten by their director and allowed to leave their mark on the film as well; usually, I would have deplored the sex'n'drugs incident with the teenage groupie as being totally gratuitous but seeing how this was another of Rourke's hit-and-miss attempts to connect with the two important females in his life, provides immense poignancy and the requisite touch of authenticity (aided, of course, by the unglamorous milieux, including Rourke's humiliating stretch as a deli counter attendant). Admittedly, I used to be a big fan of wrestling as a kid, until the obviousness of the matches being staged (as opposed to real) started to grate on me; however, the sometimes extremely bloody fights on display here  especially one in which Rourke's opponent empties a stapler on him!  reminded me even more of 2 wrestling-themed Japanese animated series I have fond memories of: TIGER MASK (1969-71) and its follow-up (1981-82)! Still, I was surprised to see the various contestants actually 'scripting' their bouts beforehandnot to mention Rourke helping out with the sensationalistic aspect of the sport via self-inflicted wounds while supposedly knocked out in the ring! Another big plus to the film is the nostalgic 1980s soundtrack full of big stadium rockers, but the ambiguously open-ended conclusion was perhaps misjudged.",8,1,3,8 February 2009
Hancock," HANCOCK (Peter Berg, 2008) **1/2
","I had decided to dedicate the start of this year mostly to the viewing of foreign-language films but, since my father rented this atypical superhero flick, I took the opportunity of a break from the relative seriousness and watch something that was not too demanding. The premise in itself – of a reckless and uncouth alien whose superhuman abilities prove singularly alienating – is not half bad, but it is let down by the unreal CGI effects and the equally fake machismo displayed throughout by star Will Smith. Mind you, the results are entertaining enough – but, again, the baffling emphasis on vulgarity negates the film at least part of its intended audience! The twist involving the character of Charlize Theron (wasted here) was kind of unnecessary, too, especially since it inserts an incongruous dose of sobriety (vis-a'-vis her subsequent conflicted relationship with the conveniently amnesiac Smith and oblivious hubby Jason Bateman) – eventually giving way to outright and unwarranted sentimentality, only to be dispelled soon after by the obligatory 'happy' ending. While I admit to not expecting much from it in the first place, I did enjoy the film on the wholebut, at the end of the day, it is all pretty bland and not sufficiently quirky to live in the memory.",5,0,2,24 January 2010
Inception," INCEPTION (Christopher Nolan, 2010) ***
","Seeing how Luis Bunuel (the master in the depiction of cinematic reveries) is my all-time favorite auteur, it goes without saying that I am fascinated by dream sequences in movies and the notion that INCEPTION was going to be an elaborate exploration of the dream-state in arty sci-fi/caper thriller terms was a potentially invigorating one. I must say that director Nolan assembled quite a remarkable cast here (even though it does feel sometimes like their names were ticked triumphantly off of a list of actors he has been wanting to work with): Leonardo Di Caprio, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page and Ken Watanabe (being the established 'heavyweights'); Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon Levitt and Dileep Rao (the up-and-coming 'new breed'); Tom Berenger, Lukas Haas and Pete Poslethwaite (the 'comeback' crowd); plus Michael Caine and Cillian Murphy (from Nolan's own 'stock company'). All the actors rise deftly to the occasion but I would single out Cotillard (as Di Caprio's enigmatic dead wife who haunts him constantly), Gordon-Levitt and Hardy (as members of Di Caprio's elite theme of dream-stealers) for particular praise. Two equally impressive contributions to the film's overall success are Hans Zimmer's powerful score and some truly dazzling special visual effects (especially during the amazing 'folding city' sequence). Besides, for a typically (by today's standards) protracted 148-minute movie, it was a surprisingly fast ride.Now, as is perhaps my custom for contemporary fare, comes the barrage of reservations I had with the film which, in some people's minds, might disqualify the *** (i.e. good) rating above!: above all, I had a problem with the film's relentless desire to 'have the cake and eat it too' by turning out what is, essentially, the cerebral version of the action-packed Summer blockbuster. The members of Di Caprio's team are supposed to be technological geeks but the extraordinary life-saving feats they accomplish in the movie (albeit only ever taking place in their subconscious) would make James Bond dive for his hat and pension cheque!; the latter's iconic presence is particularly recalled in the final snow-bound dream sequence that literally plays out like the 21st century version of ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE (1969). I also found the gravity-defying flying antics of the hotel room set-piece hard to take and not a little silly (especially when Gordon-Levitt has to carry out his dormant companions on top of one another!) – and this is coming from somebody who has so far resisted the urge to watch (sacrilege of sacrileges) THE MATRIX trilogy. Again, I understand that most of what we see is supposed to be taking place in the dream-state but it felt pretty ridiculous to me to have six people all asleep at one time all the timeeven though every manner of bullet and bomb is exploding all around them! Amusingly, that enormously extended slow-motion shot of the van tumbling into the sea reminded me of Howard Hawks' (unjust in his case) denigrating comment on one of my all-time favorite Westerns i.e. Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH (1969)!On one hand, I am in awe of Christopher Nolan for having undertaken such a dauntingly complex task – creating a multi-layered maze of dreams within dreams – all by himself (even if it took him a good eight years to do so); on the other hand, however, I do not accept the fact that this should excuse several illogicalities that bugged me as I was watching it, namely: why would Di Caprio accept a newbie (albeit one as graceful as Page and who had been recommended to him by his father-in-law Caine) as part of the team for one final fling at his ultra-specialized job with an all-important outcome (reuniting him with his long-lost children)?; similarly, how on earth could a mere industrialist (Watanabe) nullify Di Caprio's murder charges by making one phone call?; what was the point of the team risking their lives repeatedly to discover the contents of Poslethwaite's vault when it has been telegraphed in advance (in that recurring photograph of Murphy as a boy) all along? – irresistible shades of CITIZEN KANE (1941)'s 'Rosebud' climactic revelation perchance?; I am sure there was a rock-solid reason for Nolan and Zimmer to go for Edith Piaf's 'Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien' anthem as the team's 'wake-up' tunebut the Cotillard connection made it seem far too deliberate. The one cardinal sin that the film commits, in my humble opinion, is that none of the dreams seemed the least bit dream-like to me! They are far too realistically realized and cleverly choreographed to ever attain the jumbled-up and repetitive nature of a true dream {sic}. Although one could easily tell whose dream we were in at any given point in time (since that character is virtually the protagonist in his own vision), I have to admit to losing sight of the stakes in some of them and, what is worse, I did not really care! Equally unimportant, it seems to me, was whether the totem would stop spinning, fall off the table or whatever in that 'not-all-that-unexpected' open ending!!",7,7,16,25 July 2010
WALL·E," WALL-E (Andrew Stanton, 2008) ***
","This brand-new Oscar winner for Best Animated Feature is an unusual and generally successful Pixar offering (marred by a sag in the middle). The amiable titular character is a robot entrusted with the clean-up of a decimated Earth; typically humanized, he falls for the female probe sent to determine the habitable condition of life on our planet. The design of the film (both the Earth wasteland  familiar architectural landscapes have been replaced by scraps of garbage  and the spaceship to which Wall-E follows his beloved  presciently peopled by laid-back, overweight non-entities) are interesting and quite sophisticated for this type of fare. The eclectic score includes original material (notably Peter Gabriel's Oscar-nominated song 'Down To Earth') but also a couple of numbers from the musical 'Hello, Dolly!'  seen via an old VHS copy of the 1969 film version which Wall-E is continuously playing.BURN-E (Angus MacLane, 2008) **1/2 This slight but harmless short is a made-for-video spin-off of the theatrical animated feature WALL-E (2008) highlighting a very minor character from it and has appropriately been included on that film's DVD edition; it feels like a deleted scene from the main feature, but actually involved a different director. The titular figure this time around is an accident-prone robot  getting to grips with a mischievous signpost  on the spaceship seen in WALL-E (the character  and his mate  even makes a cameo here via scenes lifted from his own vehicle!).",7,0,2,18 March 2009
The Cannonball Run," THE CANNONBALL RUN (Hal Needham, 1981) **
","This is one of those films watched during my childhood days which, unfortunately, didn't now live up to my recollection of it; even if I knew it doesn't have a good reputation (despite the box-office success which spawned a sequel three years later), I still expected the film to be more entertaining than it proved to be! The film is said to rip-off THE GUMBALL RALLY (1976), which I haven't watched; ironically, I had intended to check it out for this Christmas season as well but its DVD is currently unavailable at my local rental outlet. Being only a little over one and a half hours in length, the narrative doesn't have enough time to adequately accommodate its roster of stars, all of whom seem to be there for the fun of it anyway: a pity, therefore, that this sentiment isn't always transmitted to the audience! The cast is led by Burt Reynolds (a regular in ex-stuntman/director Needham's films  having been also the star of the 'Smokey And The Bandit' franchise), Dom De Luise (whose character has a superhero alter-ego named Captain Chaos  one of the film's few inspired touches), Roger Moore (playing a man posing as Roger Moore and with the expected rampant nods to his James Bond image!) and Rat Packers Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. (who spend most of the time disguised as priests)! Also on hand is Jack Elam (as an eccentric doctor who likes to inject himself with whatever he's administering to his patients!), Jackie Chan (who manages to demonstrate a bit of his martial arts prowess but his scenes are otherwise among the dullest in the film), Jamie Farr (as an Arab sheik, whose role will eventually be expanded in the sequel), Peter Fonda (as the leader of a biker gang, what else?) and, of course, a number of women including Farrah Fawcett (who naturally hitches up with Reynolds) and Adrienne Barbeau (as one of two female competitors who don't think twice about using their generous cleavage to get ahead in the race). To be honest, having been a few days since I watched both films anew, their proceedings (and jokes) now seem not only interchangeable but have begun to fade in the memory; I do recall, however, that the race is finally won by the two sexy girls (after Captain Chaos is called upon for help just as he's about to tread the finishing line)!",4,0,3,21 December 2008
X-Men: First Class," X-MEN: FIRST CLASS (Matthew Vaughn, 2011) ***
","The X-MEN series is surely among the more consistent superhero franchises out there: despite the blot that was X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE (2009), the film-makers went on and gave us the back-story of Professor X, Magneto and, to a lesser extent, Mystique. Having been impressed with all of director Vaughn's previous efforts and particularly the similar KICK-ASS (2010), I was looking forward to this being, at least, miles ahead of WOLVERINE (another apparently solo effort of whom is being prepped for next year!) – which it certainly proved to be.Since we had already been given glimpses into Magneto's childhood in the very first entry, Vaughn (and producer Bryan Singer, who had directed the original) expands upon it, while also presenting us with the friendship – that would eventually turn into deadly animosity – between the two polar leaders of the future Mutant struggle (Mystique, too, had been 'adopted' by Charles Xavier but eventually changed allegiance to serve his nemesis Magneto). This element here, however, lands the film into problems of logic: of course, you might say that, if one is willing to accept such a fantastic concept to begin with, why bother with the details – but I am sure that, if these had been better thought out, the film would have emerged an even stronger outing. Anyway, here goes: since both Xavier and Mystique are depicted as quite young at this stage, why is it that in the original series, he is seen as a bald and white-haired figure while she can still pass muster as a stunning femme fatale (incidentally, Rebecca Romijn puts in a blink-and-you'll-miss-her cameo when her incarnation here, Jennifer Lawrence, ages to womanhood in the wake of Magneto's mocking of her excessive youth!). In the same breadth, while recruiting mutants, Professor X and Magneto (then still Eric Lehnsherr) happen upon the irascible Logan, Wolverine himself – but, rather than being played by a younger counterpart, Hugh Jackman already essays the part...so, then, why does it take Professor X some 30 years (during which time the former has not aged at all!) to bring him around to his way of thinking?!Typically, with a film concerning numerous superheroes or, to put it more aptly, gifted persons, some are allowed to shine more than others (in both good and evil camps, mind you); it was a mistake, however, to sideline Mystique's character as just one of the teens, since she had been part of the team from the very start (even before Eric!). Most of the others, in fact, come across as mere show-offs (despite Xavier's diligence in harnessing their individual power) – with Beast's complete transformation evoking uneasy parallels to the TEEN WOLF movies from the 1980s! The real villain here, then, is Kevin Bacon who progresses from Nazi associate to big-time industrialist to Mutant megalomaniac (when he is prevented from unleashing World War III, by making judicious use of stock footage pertaining to the Cuban Missile Crisis of the early 1960s, he decides to turn himself into a one-man thermo-nuclear reactor!). Also, while the presence of CIA agent and nominal heroine Rose Byrne does not really come to bear on the central plot, she eventually proves a pivotal pawn in Xavier's crippling accident – which definitely severs his ties with Eric (then again, Mystique ought to have been more considerate towards her mentor at this particularly difficult moment!).In the end, the film's success or failure rests squarely on the shoulders of the two leads and, thankfully, both James McAvoy as Xavier and especially Michael Fassbender (incidentally, both he and Bacon are made to speak in a variety of languages throughout!) as Eric deliver the goods. For the record, the film's most awe-inspiring moment/special effect is the one where Magneto 'compels' Bacon's sub out of the sea (in full view of dumb-founded American and Russian battleship personnel!) and brings it to land on a sandy beach – where the ultimate battle (at least of this 'new' first entry) is raged. By the way, it was also nice to see the likes of Michael Ironside, Ray Wise and Rade Sherbedgia in minor roles.",7,0,2,18 July 2011
Fifty Shades of Grey," FIFTY SHADES OF GREY (Sam Taylor-Johnson, 2015) **1/2
","Last Friday's theatrical screening of the long-awaited film adaptation of the literary phenomenon that gave rise to the dubious 'Mommy Porn' subgenre was decidedly the noisiest one I have ever attended: females (who, unsurprisingly, made up the vast majority of the audience) gabbing relentlessly to each other throughout, women talking directly to the screen, another who gagged on her popcorn and a chubby girl who commented out loud that she would not allow anyone to whip her like thatas if any one would ever care to or she would even feel the pain?! I was only vaguely familiar with the novel until mid-2012 when it became a daily topic of conversation among female colleagues at my workplace! Eventually, curiosity got the better of me and I downloaded a .pdf edition of the trilogy (I would not dream of spending money to acquire them legitimately!); the low level of writing on the first book (especially) was even more off-putting than any of its would-be objectionable content turned out to be...but I soldiered on and read through the first and second novel – even if by the time the film version came along three years later, I am still stuck in the initial stages of the third book! Anyhow, learning that several of those same female colleagues had decided to attend a screening of the film and make a 'Girls' Night' out of the event, I cluelessly decided to join their party uninvited...The millions of fans of the novels worldwide immediately had their own ideas regarding who would be ideal casting for the central roles of disturbed billionaire Christian Grey and plain ingénue Anastasia Steele...but, in the end, these fell into the laps of Irish model-turned-actor Jamie Dornan (handsome, sure – but even more wooden than any of the instruments of pain/pleasure at his disposal in the infamous 'Red Room of Pain') and the admittedly beguiling Dakota Johnson (the daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, no less); tellingly enough, the latter was invited to present at yesterday's Oscar ceremony but Dornan was not. Nepotism, perhaps (after all, the film was similarly breaking box office records worldwide)...but I do not think so. From the rest of the cast, only two names rang a bell for me, incidentally both saddled with the thankless roles of the parents of each respective protagonist, namely Oscar winner Marcia Gay Harden and Jennifer Ehle. I do not recall if it was like that in the first book as well but I was surprised to see that the major secondary character of 'Mrs. Robinson' was only whispered about a couple of times but never actually appeared. Indeed, some people seemed surprised by the abrupt ending expecting the film to be a reductive adaptation of the trilogy...as if Hollywood would ever lose an opportunity to take two more trips to this goldmine in the coming years!While I found nothing all that salacious about the book's copious erotic passages myself (I have been an avid reader of Georges Bataille's novels from 75 years previously after all!), the film's even blander depiction of them is disappointingly tame...so much so that the rumours I had heard that the sex scenes where going to be filmed in silhouette and the fact that it has actually been banned outright in several backward-thinking territories are totally laughable in retrospect. Johnson's small 'mammalian protuberances' (to steal a phrase from the late great Frank Zappa) get the most mileage but Dornan is not averse to filling up with screen with the occasional close-up of his bare bottom ('a perfect 10' according to the most adulatory among my female friends – who, nevertheless, also took time out to spot a couple of goofs that escaped me and google a difficult word)! But, then, there are no glimpses of blood at all in the film or, come to that, pubic hair during its 15 minutes of sexual content overall!! Needless to say, this was more of a studio marketing ploy to keep the film from being slapped with a forbidding NC-17 rating rather than a case of artistic cold feet on the film-makers' part. Still, as it is, director Sam Taylor-Johnson will remain most notorious in years to come for having married an actor 23 years her junior (Aaron Johnson, of KICKASS fame) than for having helmed the steamy film version of FIFTY SHADES OF GREY!! What with the film hurrying through the narrative and skimping on the juiciest parts...but, thankfully, Christian's irritating habit of tilting his head and Anastasia's cringe-inducing and somersaulting 'conscience' have been jettisoned!!It is all the more a pity, therefore, that one learns how director Johnson counts The Velvet Underground's 1967 counter-culture classic debut as one of her favourite albums since what is on display in her own film is worlds apart from the full-blooded BDSM relationship depicted in the shattering 'Venus In Furs', the song which made me fall in love with this all-time favourite band of mine in the first place! Equally fitting would have been The Stooges' 'I Wanna Be Your Dog' from their own John Cale-produced 1969 debut (incidentally, I got to see Cale live at a London concert in October 2012)...but, at least, we do get The Rolling Stones' 1978 hit 'Beast of Burden' on the eclectic soundtrack that also features classical pieces and contemporary pop stuff. Just as the literary works did not really break new ground (it just slyly appealed to the lowest common denominator and hit the collective jackpot..or is that G-spot?!), so the film follows in the wake of much older (and much better) films that had tackled the controversial theme of BDSM far more liberally and artistically, among them Mario Bava's THE WHIP AND THE BODY (1963), (my own No. 1 film-maker) Luis Bunuel's BELLE DE JOUR (1967), Henri-Georges Clouzot LA PRISONNIERE (1968), Yasuzo Masumura's BLIND BEAST (1969), Radley Metzger's THE IMAGE (1975), Walerian Borowczyk's LOVE RITES (1988), Roman Polanski's BITTER MOON (1992), etc.!",6,12,22,23 February 2015
Iron Man," IRON MAN (Jon Favreau, 2008) ***
","As I was growing up, one of my main sources of entertainment (not to mention education) was Italian TV which is where I caught several of the now-classic animated TV series based on Marvel comics superheroes like Captain America, Hulk, Iron Man, Spiderman, Submariner, Thor, X-Men, etc. It goes without saying that, with time, these were turned into movies and, in some cases, highly successful franchises. This year was Iron Man's turn to hit the big screen and, happily, it turned out to be one of the best such adaptations.The primary reason for the superior end result is one: Robert Downey Jr. is an inspired choice for leading man and he meets the blockbusting challenge head-on with a terrific, nuanced central performance that makes Tony Stark a believably three-dimensional character. It is reported that Downey was a fan of the original comic books themselves and that his contribution to the film was a far more creative one than is usual for actors and it shows. His extensive commitment may also have been triggered by the fact that, for all intents and purposes, the life story of Tony Stark uncannily parallels that of Downey himself: a talented person living in the shadow of his famous father who wastes his time away in hedonistic abandon until a traumatic experience set his priorities right and well onto his way to full rehabilitation.A hero is only as good as his nemesis and, in this case, Jeff Bridges' duplicitous business partner comes up trumps. Perhaps wisely, his bald-headed, goateed villain is not the overacted, larger-than-life type but a sleek, ruthless profiteer whose line of work happens to be the proliferation of warfare around the world. Equally important for superheroes are their girlfriends and here Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts is the sweet, sensitive secretary rather than the usual on/off damsel-in-distress. Also on hand is the sidekick in the shape of Terence Howard's army official and the eccentric lab assistant who – as a sign of the times – is an Afghan family man who has been taken prisoner by an ambitious war lord! Leslie Bibb's blonde bimbo reporter is worth mentioning as well not only for her looks but even for the way in which her character unconsciously spurs Stark onwards to first adopt a conscience and, atypically for a superhero, reveal Iron Man's true identity at the very end.For a modern Hollywood blockbuster which has its eyes firmly on becoming a lucrative franchise, IRON MAN is a literate movie with only a handful of action set-pieces which, needless to say, deliver the goods when they do come. In fact, the film's middle section is taken up by Stark's various experiments with perfecting his equipment, refining the look of Iron Man and, amusingly, his love/hate relationship with his clumsy robotic assistant. If there is one major flaw in the film, it's the climactic assumption that businessman Jeff Bridges is as much technologically-minded as his junior partner in creating and working iron giants – especially when just moments earlier his employees seemed at a loss at coming up with anything resembling the capacities of Iron Man let alone tower over them as his Iron Monger eventually does. Anyway, it's small fry, I guess, when their climactic rooftop confrontation was, as they say, destined to happen from the outset.A frustrating modern trend in movies is that of continuing it after the credits have already started rolling and, apparently, IRON MAN is guilty of this fallacy as well – although, personally, I wouldn't know as I walked out of the theater right after the cast list was over! Anyhow, the film-makers have to be complemented for not taking the obvious route by making excessive use of Black Sabbath's classic titular song except for maximum effect i.e. Downey's (and the film's) closing lines being, 'I am Iron Man' and an instrumental passage as soon as the end credits kick in.",7,2,6,6 May 2008
Mother!," MOTHER! (Darren Aronofsky, 2017) **1/2
","Director Aronofsky has said that he came up with the idea for this film after a screening of Luis Bunuel's THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962) & his own thinking on the current human condition! As I lay watching the film - undoubtedly the most controversial release of the year - I was also reminded of many other films: Bunuel's own VIRIDIANA (1961; in the way in which invited guests unceremoniously take over a household) & SIMON OF THE DESERT (1965; throngs of people invading the personal space of & expecting answers from their idol); Roman Polanski's REPULSION (1965; a repressed woman who never ventures outside her home & loses her mind), ROSEMARY'S BABY (1968; a struggling artist invites a sinister couple into his marital home & they take over to the chagrin of the introverted & pregnant wife) & THE TENANT (1976; which had been the director's own male version of REPULSION anyway); Mike Nichols' WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRIGINA WOOLF? (1966; a younger married couple are the disbelieving witness to the constant squabbles of an older couple); & any number of Euro-horrors climaxing in conflagration & reincarnation (including Francesco Barilli's THE PERFUME OF THE LADY IN BLACK [1974])!! The narrative is clearly an allegory but I found the implied biblical connotations heavy-handed & the overt criticism of modern-day fame perfunctory. Most audiences were shocked by the gory climax & some critics deemed this a black comedy; frankly, I was neither horrified nor entertained! All the characters involved (except for the perennially barefooted Lawrence) range from the slightly unsympathetic (Bardem) to the downright annoying (Harris & Pfeiffer)...one can't really fault Aronofsky's technical prowess here but, as Biblical tracts go, I preferred his more irreverent NOAH (2014), while BLACK SWAN (2012; still his best work) was a far more interesting & satisfying 'descent into the maelstrom'.",6,1,4,10 December 2017
Casino Royale," CASINO ROYALE (Martin Campbell, 2006) ***1/2
","Against every conceivable odds, the 21st James Bond adventure is one of his best: the highly unpopular choice of leading man (with die-hard fans of the series) paid off in spades as blonde Daniel Craig - who had previously impressed more for his restrained acting than his animal magnetism in both ROAD TO PERDITION (2002) and MUNICH (2005) - lends the character a determination, temerity and, most importantly perhaps, vulnerability missing since the earlier Sean Connery incarnations. The fact that he was faced with the burden of playing one of the screen's most iconic characters and encountering such overwhelming opposition at first, seems to have merely aided in making Craig's characterization of James Bond as, ironically, more believable than perhaps ever before.This is not to say that the spectacular stunts and action sequences - not to mention Bond's enviable way with a witty line or prowess in the bedchamber - have been jettisoned or diluted in favor of realistic minimalism but, the fact remains that more time than usual is dedicated here to delving into the various characters appearing in the story instead of previous upping-the-ante tactics which necessitated numerous climaxes seeking to upstage not only the ones seen in previous films but even those within the film itself. The relationship between Bond and his partner Vesper Lynd (the luscious Eva Green) is one of the most emotional and satisfying in the entire series and, despite my initial misgivings prior to watching the film, Mads Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre is a terrific opponent with a subtly effective make-up to go with his intense performance. The supporting cast is also worth mentioning: apart from Judi Dench (who is by now filling in impeccably for the formidable Bernard Lee) as M, we have Jeffrey Wright's bemused Felix Leiter and Giancarlo Giannini's reptilian Mathis, a welcome ally to Bond as he steps into the spider's lair that is the Casino of the title but, as usual with these spy sagas, loyalties - to say nothing of love - cannot be taken at face value.At 144 minutes, this is also the longest James Bond vehicle so far but as I mentioned earlier, CASINO ROYALE is easily the best of the series in 25 years (at the very least). Frankly, I've only been able to take Roger Moore's overtly tongue-in-cheek James Bond persona in small doses, have had little use for Timothy Dalton's glumness and only been wholly satisfied with Pierce Brosnan's take in TOMORROW NEVER DIES (1997). It is, therefore, very refreshing to see, for once, a James Bond film whose plot is not only exciting but, free as it is of the ingenious but distracting gadgets which proliferated in previous outings, also quite absorbing. The black-and-white introduction is a nice touch, the rather harrowing torture sequence is possibly a first for the series and, among the handful of action highlights, the crumbling of a Venetian edifice towards the end is as spectacular as they come.",8,2,5,2 January 2007
La Vie En Rose," LA VIE EN ROSE (Olivier Dahan, 2007) ***
","I only really became interested in watching this after its recent (and frankly unexpected) Oscar success; on the other hand, I knew of celebrated French singer Edith Piaf but wasn’t familiar with her life-story – so that I couldn’t tell whether certain passages weren’t contrived (notably the decision to make the final tour despite her failing health on the strength of just a cursory listen of “Je Ne Regrette Rien”) or if they truly happened that way! Incidentally, the film spends much more time on the singer’s troubled life (which seemed to parallel that of Judy Garland – eerily, both died at the same age) than on her career (so that the only reason given for Piaf’s enormous success is that she has “powerful lungs”!)…but, then, this emphasis on sensationalism seems to be the way of modern biopics (making one long for yesteryear’s whitewashed but much more entertaining efforts). Still, the biggest drawback in this respect is that we end up appreciating the actress’ performance (especially coming from a virtual unknown like Marion Cotillard) more than the subject itself, which is certainly not what the film-makers intended!! We see the singer suffer at the hands of her parents (alcoholic mother and itinerant father), so that she’s raised by her grandmother – in a whorehouse of all places; here, she grows attached to one of the girls (Emmanuelle Seigner) – but, eventually, they’re separated. Later on, she befriends a waif: rather than prostituting herself for a pimp, she gets him money through street-singing – which is how impresario Gerard Depardieu notices her. Not long after, however, the latter is murdered by her pimp but Piaf is picked up by another entrepreneur who takes her under his wing – and, following his arduous voice coaching, she’s on her way to stardom.Now a household word, she’s also pretty much a society woman (at one point, she’s even visited by Marlene Dietrich!) – which is how Piaf (by the way, a stagename given her by Depardieu) meets and falls for boxing champ Marcel Cerdan. Their relationship is complicated by his being already married – one night, craving to see him, she pleads that he leave his family to go by her side but is killed when the plane he boards crashes on the way! Considering him the love of her life (despite being married herself and also numbering among her lovers – though he’s never seen in the film and mentioned only in passing – iconic singer/actor Yves Montand, whom she discovered in the first place), she gradually falls apart. The situation isn’t helped by Piaf’s crippling arthritis – or, for that matter, her dependence on morphine (the direct result of her misguided attempt to fight that very condition) – all of which gives her a shocking appearance much older than her age! Apart from the superb leading performance and equally convincing make-up (both deserving Oscar winners), the film is carefully made in the best French tradition i.e. a product which is often pleasing to the eye, the ear and the mind. By the way, this is a rare case in which a foreign movie was released in English-speaking countries under a different title but still in its original language (here, it’s the name of Piaf’s most popular song); that said, I do know of a couple of American pictures released in Italy with English monikers – namely HARPER (1966), which became DETECTIVE’S STORY, and BONNIE AND CLYDE (1967), which was changed to GANGSTER STORY (both curious retitlings…since they’d already been taken in the U.S.!).",7,1,3,18 July 2008
Saving Mr. Banks," SAVING MR. BANKS (John Lee Hancock, 2013) ***
","Five-time Oscar winner MARY POPPINS (1964) remains Walt Disney's most popular and critically-acclaimed of all his live action films and this latest such entry from the same stable should serve as an eye-opener to its legion of fans on how films were made back in the day and a delightful nostalgia trip for seasoned film buffs. Emma Thompson is perfectly cast as the beloved character's stubborn literary creator P.L. Travers who is ever so reluctant (a 20-year struggle, in fact!) to sell the film rights to animation mogul Disney (Tom Hanks – who despite being 10 years too young for the role – acquits himself well). The vivid recreation of the Walt Disney Studios and Disneyland and the entertaining tit-for-tat discussions between Travers, co-screenwriter Don DaGradi, songwriters Richard and Robert Sherman and Disney himself are countered (and, ultimately, bogged down) by dismal flashbacks set in the Australian outback in which we see Travers' childhood completely under the influence of her boozing dreamer of a banker father (Colin Farrell) – which is what the odd choice of title for the film itself is all about. The over-reliance on the Musical's admittedly catchy songs does get repetitive after a while and, as expected, a certain amount of whitewashing of the reportedly unsavory main characters was involved. Having said that, the film's two best sequences for me were when Travers' beleaguered chauffeur (Paul Giamatti) reveals to her that his daily weather reporting to his passenger – which bugged her no end – stemmed from the fact that it affected his 'handicapped' daughter's mobility; and towards the very end when Disney unexpectedly flies to London (in an 11th hour attempt to get a still defiant Travers to sign) and confesses to her that his own relationship with his newspaper editor father was no less fraught. I also liked the idea that the end credits not only display photographs of the protagonists from the era depicted (which only serves to highlight the fact that none of the actors employed really resemble them!) but the voice of Travers is also heard via recordings she herself insisted upon of the entire consultation process!",7,1,3,5 January 2014
Live Free or Die Hard," DIE HARD 4.0 (Len Wiseman, 2007) ***
","My tolerance for Bruce Willis only extends itself to when he portrays the seemingly indestructible Detective John McClane in the DIE HARD films – a role which, even twenty years from its inception, still fits him like a glove. His charismatic persona goes a long way in making this hopelessly complicated and yet often dumbly illogical blockbuster undeniably entertaining throughout its not ungenerous 130 minute running time; needless to say, the spectacular action set-pieces are practically innumerable, with each one taking pains to outdo its predecessor in grandness and incredulity.I can’t hope to make head or tails of the plot for those of you who haven’t seen it yet: suffice it to say, it’s predictably tinged with post-9/11 paranoia in the villains’ bid to put America on its bended knees through the wizardry of a network of geeky cyber-hackers…or something. I have to laugh when in the 1960s, many Cold War espionage pictures were dismissed as incomprehensible, because today’s penchant for hi-tech hijinks and unspeakably technical verbosity in even the most unassuming of thrillers shows a total lack of audience-friendliness. Another puzzling trait in contemporary Hollywood movies for me is the fact that anonymous (often impossibly young) villains are chosen to face off against the formidable hero of the day which rather makes one wonder why it took the latter two-and-a-half hours and so many near death experiences to get rid of this unfailingly sore loser; this is certainly the case here since the main villain is played by an unknown actor, his character was fired by the U.S. government when his plans were deemed too ambitious for them and, worse still, is effortlessly upstaged by his female co-conspirator/lover Maggie Q (who eventually meets her demise in one of the film’s lengthiest and most impressive action sequences). Interestingly enough, Willis himself is flanked by a computer freak but his wimpering, stuttering schtick outstays its welcome; writer-director-actor Kevin Smith has a pleasant cameo as the hacker guru dubbing himself “Warlock”.Although one is expected to suspend his disbelief in films of this kind, there were a couple of stupid plot-holes the size of Manhattan which bugged me no end: if the villain was a top official in the U.S. Security defense program, clearly bears a grudge against them for humiliating him and is actually enacting the very threat he proposed back then in the first place, why do the F.B.I. need John McClane to alert them to his identity? Besides, if the villain is so technologically adept that he creates ultra-sensitive security programs for the U.S. government, how come he needs a whole barrage of computer geeks to put his plan into action (which, naturally, also necessitates an assortment of armed-to-their-teeth henchmen to eliminate them once they’ve completed their assignment?).",7,1,2,13 January 2008
300," 300 (Zack Snyder, 2006) ***
","I wasn't really expecting to enjoy this epic/comic-strip adaptation but I was quite pleasantly surprised and even impressed by it (watching it on the big screen decidedly helped); while clearly superior to the more straightforward telling of the legendary battle in the Hollywood spectacular THE 300 SPARTANS (1962), it's also certainly the closest approximation to a graphic novel that cinema has come up with so far (the desaturated color scheme really puts one in the ambiance). The unexpectedly full-blooded acting (especially lead Gerard Butler) also managed to breathe life into stock characters often forced to mouth propagandist slogans (though the Spartans' battle cry, making them sound more like an American football team, is corny)! The battle sequences are among the fiercest ever depicted, even if the gimmicky editing distracts from their ultimate impact. Where the film tends to falter is in the unnecessary grotesquerie on display  the lecherous Spartan leper priests, the conniving hunchback, the campily made-up Persian king and his ogre warriors, etc.",7,1,5,15 July 2007
Fantastic Four," Fantastic Four (2005) **1/2
","Bland, forgettable addition to the myriad CGI-happy super-hero flicks (of alarmingly variable quality): in this case, I recall watching the cartoon version from my childhood and, frankly, apart from the excessive technical jargon unpersuasively mouthed by the cardboard characters, this big-screen adaptation shows little or no sign of a higher intelligence at work and, indeed, in the brash antics of Chris Evans and the lame rock score, suggests that it was primarily designed with the dreaded 'teen market' in mind! As such it's mindlessly enjoyable, particularly Michael Chiklis' wisecracks...and Jessica Alba's presence certainly doesn't hurt (though it had to be her character that was rendered invisible by the script!).",6,0,1,24 March 2006
Moon," MOON (Duncan Jones, 2009) ***
","The first thing that needs to be said (and which might not be readily apparent to the uninformed) is that director Duncan Jones is David Bowie's son i.e. he who was formerly known as Zowie Bowie. MOON is a quietly impressive directorial debut that was deservedly much acclaimed and most of its success hinges on a tour-de-force central performance from Sam Rockwell – playing triple roles in what is virtually a one-man-show. The plot-line would initially seem to be reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968) – the interaction between astronaut and the human-voiced computer (dispassionately provided here by Kevin Spacey) – and Douglas Trumbull's SILENT RUNNING (1972) – the isolation of the astronaut on an ecological mission; however, the twist revelation in the middle swerves it admirably into the realm of Andrei Tarkovsky's SOLARIS (1972)...not to mention any number of clones/replicants/surrogates scenarios we have seen in the last 30 years! This is certainly not to say that MOON is simply a rehash of past sci-fi fare but merely to highlight the fact that the film-makers know their stuff and, consequently, have managed to make something equally worthwhile despite the thematic echoes. Two further assets to the production that bear mentioning are Clint Mansell's evocative score (with, I might add, no use of Bowie Snr.'s epochal 'Space Oddity' anywhere) and the predominant whites in the production design.",7,2,7,19 February 2010
Her," HER (Spike Jonze, 2013) **1/2
","The second (out of nine) from this year's crop of Best Picture Oscar nominees I have watched so far is this quirky romance that is strenuously made in the style of the same director's previous 'Oscar bait' movies, BEING JOHN MALKOVICH (1999) and ADAPTATION (2002) – except that here he wrote the Oscar-nominated script himself, as opposed to relying on regular collaborator Charlie Kaufman (now a director himself). What we have here is a wistful futuristic tale, set against an appropriately cold, glassy Oscar-nominated production design, about a lonely electronic letter 'narrator' (my words) – played by Joaquin Phoenix – who is currently going through a divorce from wife Rooney Mara. He is friends with a couple (one of whom is documentarian Amy Adams) who also have their own matrimonial issues and eventually split up. Before long, Phoenix acquires an ultra-intelligent computer (called 'OS', that is to say, 'Operating System') to keep him company; however, since this – voiced by Scarlett Johansson – begins, in true HAL 9000-style, to display genuine human emotions, he ends up falling for it! To be fair to the protagonist, he does attempt normal dates (with an unaccountably stunning female to boot) – but they invariably fail to live up to the 'perfection' offered by Samantha (as the computer names itself – perhaps a remnant of executive producer Samantha Morton having been Jonze's original choice to voice Phoenix's OS) which, missing only a body, of her own accord hires a substitute to 'make love' to Phoenix! Meanwhile he begins to have second thoughts about his impending divorce and Adams also goes through this same renewal of love through electronics For one thing, there was no reason to extend this 'one-trick pony' tale to over two hours' duration; while the script is undeniably insightful about human relations and the way they have been altered by increasingly user-friendly technology, it also comes across as irritatingly superficial when dealing with what it perceives will come to pass as real life: people speaking to a computer in the streets or playing interactive video games at home, not to mention engaging in virtual intercourse with their PC and hiring professionals to dictate their letters for them. Indeed, does an archaic job like this even have to exist in this day and age? Or, in the words of a close friend of mine, 'Who today writes letters anymore?' The film's two other Oscar nods are for Best Original Song (co-written by Jonze) and Best Music Score (courtesy of contemporary cult Canadian band Arcade Fire).",6,3,8,14 February 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE (Danny Boyle, 2008) ***
","A curious mix of CITY OF GOD (2002) and QUIZ SHOW (1994), this surprising multi-Oscar winner is a good film to be sure but also somewhat overrated (as was director Boyle's TRAINSPOTTING [1996] after all). The editing is deftly intricate (spanning several years, the story continually jumps back and forth in time) and the exotic score certainly effective; however, Boyle's flashy technique rings false within the context of its underprivileged setting! SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE may have alerted the rest of the world to the dire conditions of life in (the so-called) modern India but, at the same time, it cannot have benefited the country's tourist industry any! The film's trump card is actually the 'impossible romance' at its core: the two young leads are believable and undeniably appealing. The whole 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?' angle, then, has a decidedly contrived feel to it: though apparently based on fact, the film was clearly intended as a fable. That said, some of the flashbacks do not really illuminate us as to how the hero knew the respective answer: for instance, does someone need to know who invented the revolver just because he owns one (much less an uneducated person) and would the final all-important question of such a show be one to which the answer could have easily been arrived at by common sense (had it not been a recurring motif)?",7,1,5,18 March 2009
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," TRANSFORMERS: DARK Of The MOON (Michael Bay, 2011) **
","The original TRANSFORMERS movie from 2007 was about the only Michael Bay effort I had enjoyed. The first sequel (which came out 2 years later), however, was a dreary mess and, while its follow-up has been touted in some circles as the best of the series, a local write-up gave it the thumbs-down; having watched the film for myself, I have to agree with the latter opinion! To be fair to it, the first half is not bad – even if one has to swallow the ruse that Apollo 11's 1969 Moon landing (complete with stock footage, and barely look-alike actors in long shot, of JFK and Richard Nixon, not to mention the presence as himself of one of the real-life astronauts involved in that historic moment i.e. Buzz Aldrin!) was really a covert mission to inspect the crash-landing of a massive space-ship emanating from the dying planet Cybertron! It transpires that the leader of the benign Autobots, Sentinel Prime, had succumbed in that disastrous escape flight but his body is retrieved and revived by his successor, Optimus Prime (who had already featured in the first two entries).Their nemeses, the Decepticons, soon learn of this and they determine to put their hands on the remaining set of pillars (they are already in possession of about a hundred others) that would save Cybertron and guarantee their dominance. However, Sentinel is not quite what it is played up to be, having sold out to the Decepticon chief, Megatron (which itself lies in a state of disrepair for much of the proceedings, the result of its failure to gain the upper hand in the two previous TRANSFORMERS pictures). In the wake of this, humans decide they can no longer trust the Machines and the Autobots are banished; this concept of 'aliens' being misunderstood, feared and ultimately hunted down was also at the core, as was the JFK cameo and the fact that a famous political incident has been incorporated into the narrative for that matter, of X-MEN: FIRST CLASS (2011) which actually preceded this viewing! Anyway, mixed with all of this are the usual suspects – Shia LeBeouf (who after two adventures is still basically at the point where we first met him, despite his having been honored with a medal for valor by none other than President Obama!), his girlfriend (Megan Fox having been dumped by the production, her character is suddenly deemed fickle and unworthy of our hero{!}, so she is replaced here by the likewise stunning but even less able acting-wise Rose Huntington-Whiteley and John Turturro (returning as the eccentric ex-CIA operative who has almost gone bourgeois in the interim). Also on hand are Frances McDormand as a supercilious CIA bigwig (her would-be comic banter with Turturro belongs in a Coen Bros. movie but clearly not here!), the even more incongruous (and basically irrelevant) casting of John Malkovich – evoking Jack Nicholson – as LeBeouf's touchy boss and Patrick Dempsey as Huntington-Whiteley's own hunk of a superior (who is improbably revealed as being in cahoots with the evil Decepticons!).The worst part of it, though, is the fact that the climactic action bout takes up the entire last hour and it does not even prove especially exciting (more often it is noisy and inordinately muddled) apart from the spectacular set-piece in which the protagonists are trapped inside a leaning skyscraper: when eventually thrown out and made to slide down its façade, they are required to shoot at the windows underneath in order to break their fall and literally drop back safely into the building!",4,4,10,18 July 2011
The Social Network," THE SOCIAL NETWORK (David Fincher, 2010) ***1/2
","When I first heard of this, I was wary of both the subject matter (the creation of the Internet fad that is 'Facebook') and the fact that a director of Fincher's status would lend his services to such an intrinsically 'geeky' venture. Since it has been sweeping the boards all through the current awards season, I had to take notice and opted to check it out prior to Oscar night (having passed the film by during its initial theatrical run locally).To be honest, it took me some time to warm up to the film given its essentially intractable nature (similar to PI [1998] and PRIMER [2004]); in this regard, it is best approached as a conspiracy thriller – with the intricacies of the dual lawsuit raised against Mark Zuckerberg proving undeniably gripping. The film is clearly dialogue-driven (with some key scenes irritatingly taking place in noisy surroundings), but the script emerges a surprisingly witty one; besides, it is most effectively scored (in part by Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor) – being appropriately capped by The Beatles' 'Baby You're A Rich Man'.I have one quibble, though: I doubt young Americans today ever really bother mentioning the likes of Teddy Roosevelt, Irving Berlin or Cole Porter in their daily conversation, or that the hotshot behind the 'Napster' application cared where THE TOWERING INFERNO (1974) was shot!; incidentally, it was odd for pop star Justin Timberlake to play someone who has had such a ruinous effect on the music industry! Moreover, I do not agree with those who feel Zuckerberg was a scoundrel: the way he is played by Jesse Eisenberg, he seems more gullible than opportunistic – and, especially powerful as a character-defining moment for him, is the poignant finale. By the way, the fact that one (especially somebody so young) can amass billions simply for having brought the world closer together, as it were, imparts Capitalist/Divine implications that are profoundly disturbing (and which, perhaps, one sensibly ought not to ponder too much on!).",8,0,4,22 January 2011
Cinderella Man," Cinderella Man (2005) ***
","A pretty good and surprisingly compelling biopic which, apart from obviously emphasizing the traditional elements of a boxing drama for commercial purposes, tries to faithfully portray its background of 1930s Depression America; this it does in meticulous detail but also excessive sentimentality, I think. Besides, the 'modern' (i.e. mannered) performances of its stars and the occasionally over-emphatic direction rather serve to detach oneself from that particular environment  which is not at all what the director intended! Still, the film's trump card remains its technically proficient and tremendously exciting boxing sequences (particularly the smooth transition from one fight to the next and the lengthy final bout between Braddock and Max Baer, though the latter is rather lazily presented as a one-dimensional villain in order to put the audience, no pun intended, firmly in Braddock's corner).",7,1,3,11 March 2006
The Fighter," THE FIGHTER (David O. Russell, 2010) ***
","More than any other type of sport, the Boxing movie has steadily attracted the attention of Oscar voters – with the most successful examples obviously being ROCKY (1976) and MILLION DOLLAR BABY (2004), since they surprisingly ended up walking away with the top prizes. However, in the vast majority of the cases, genre conventions were merely employed as a spring-board for character development – notably RAGING BULL (1980) – and this latest entry certainly follows in that tradition (being, for one thing, similarly inspired by the career of a real-life fighter).The project apparently started with star/producer Mark Wahlberg; interestingly, one of the myriad executive producers here is Darren Aronofsy who, not only directed the definitive film about another violent sport i.e. THE WRESTLER (2008), but has been competing with David O. Russell all through the current awards season for his own film about yet one more 'tortured' discipline, ballet, in BLACK SWAN (2010)! Incidentally, while Christian Bale and Melissa Leo have been garnering the biggest praise from among the cast, I found their performances (he as the protagonist's washed-out boxer-turned-junkie of an elder brother, still riding on the wave of his greatest match, and she as his harridan of a chain-smoking mother, who blindingly believes she knows what is best for her boys) grating and overly-mannered, so that I was more impressed with Wahlberg's own quiet turn and Amy Adams' compelling portrayal of his tough bar-maid girlfriend.By the way, I guess one relates to the notion of 'family as a sacred institution' like it is depicted here (and in many another film in various genres) based on his own experiences; as for myself, I have never bought into it and, if this may pre-condition the final assessment of any given film, that is just too bad! As ever with this type of crowd-pleasing fare, the boxing sequences themselves are excitingly edited for maximum impact (particularly the two in which Wahlberg emerges victorious) – but equally important is the choice of soundtrack, and it does not disappoint in this area either (including my own favorite Aerosmith song from the 1970s, 'Back In The Saddle').",7,0,3,22 January 2011
Atonement," ATONEMENT (Joe Wright, 2007) ***
","This year I've fallen so far behind in checking out the films up for an Academy Award that this one is actually the first of the heavyweight contenders  and the ceremony is just two weeks away! Anyway, this is a very British product: exceedingly refined and, therefore, teetering on the edge of boredom  in short, overrated, and encapsulating what passes for an Oscar-worthy title these days. Given the film's old-fashioned appeal and being unfamiliar with the work of director Wright, I was surprised by its flashy technique (perhaps adopted to disguise the thin plot which, such as it is, doesn't really compel attention) with the entire war segment and, in particular, the apparent necessity to present it in such detail i.e. not merely graphic but even reverting to unsubtitled French for a couple of scenes, coming off as a distraction more than anything else! The lengthy tracking shot on the beach seen during this segment is a valiant attempt even if, again, it doesn't present us with anything we haven't seen before in countless war-themed movies.Rather, it's the central idea of a single impulsive action (by a child) having terrible repercussions on an amorous young couple  and, by extension, her own life  which is the most interesting and sensitively handled (particularly when, during the moving finale, it's established that part of what has gone on before is purely wish-fulfillment on the girl's part!). Incidentally, she's the real protagonist of the narrative  despite the couple (James McAvoy and Keira Knightley) being top-billed; the girl is actually played by three different actresses (including Vanessa Redgrave)  since we see her through various phases of her life  and all of them deliver fine performances (the youngest, in fact, Saiorse Ronan has even been Oscar-nominated). In essence, this is a reasonably good film within the (low) standards prevalent nowadays  but, as with most of modern cinema, it doesn't really warrant more than a cursory viewing for me.",7,1,4,14 February 2008
V for Vendetta," V FOR VENDETTA (James McTeigue, 2005) ***
","Undoubtedly, one of the best comic strip-to-film adaptations I've seen in recent years (although, I have absolutely no idea how faithful or successful an adaptation it actually is); at any rate, it has much going for it - a good cast consisting of reliable character actors (John Hurt, Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry, Tim Piggott-Smith, etc.), spectacular production design and cinematography, an interesting - if convoluted - dystopian storyline and, last but not least, surprisingly engaging leads in Natalie Portman (who's much more attractive and at ease here than in the Star Wars series) and Hugo Weaving (who has the difficult task of acting, from beginning to end, with a mask hiding his facial features). I've never heard of the director of this one and I've never bothered with the seemingly incomprehensible MATRIX trilogy (whose makers serve as the screenwriters here) but, as I said before, I found it to be an intelligent, enjoyable and altogether very satisfying outing which, thankfully, seems not be the start of another franchise which diminishes in quality with every subsequent entry...",7,1,5,11 September 2006
