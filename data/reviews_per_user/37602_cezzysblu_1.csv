10 Cloverfield Lane," thriller?...gripping? is it really? or is it just john goodmans brilliant characterisation ?
","Against the backdrop of the ensuing apocalypse in the Clover-verse story we follow an episode where a girl struggles to escape her confinement by a nut-job who claims to have 'rescued' her.As depicted in the trailer, most of the film is shot using a few conventional sets representing the confined space of an underground survival bunker and features just three actors (with the addition of a few radio voices and one face filmed through a glass panel) I might have known that this was going to be film on a budget for a start! This should've just been a made for TV film or an episode in a box-set, but here we have jj Abrams production company's conceit that they can churn out this stuff and ask for box-office monies ($29m at time of writing)I left the cinema thinking that the film had failed to decide what it was trying to be and I am quite puzzled to see many people singing its praise.all i can say is those people must've sat through one hell of a lot of bad high-grossing movies (maybe those made by Marvel for instance).However despite this film not having destruction porn in every frame it attempted nothing new. thriller? gripping? really!? are you sure it wasn't just Goodmans character acting providing weight to a flimsy story?",5,2,5,18 March 2016
