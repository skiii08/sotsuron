The Lobster," Depends on what you like
","One of the few movies I could see a dramatic difference of opinions being accurate. If you are drawn to dystopian future states or alternate realities and dark comedies that are dramatically off center and slow moving, this is for you. If not, don't waste your time.",7,1,2,20 December 2018
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Brilliant!
",If you are looking for something completely different with a positive vibe. Look no further. Only wish they cast someone who could really sing for the lead.,9,4,8,27 June 2020
Knives Out," Disappointed
","If you are a fan of classic murder mysteries, whodunits and Clue, this movie is agreeable but a huge disappointment. Daniel Craig's southern accent is horrendous. The rest of the acting is pedestrian and the actual mystery is not compelling.",3,3,9,6 January 2020
Gone Baby Gone," Just wow
","How did I not see this movie until now? Raw, powerful, superb acting, well crafted script and the type of movie that makes you question what is truly right and wrong. Flat out one of the best movies I've seen in years.",9,1,1,28 June 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Real and Objective Review
","I'm not caught up in the history of Spider Man or how the franchise has evolved over time. With that perspective, it's easy to judge this movie on its own merits. The animation is flat-out amazing. Rather than the the pages of a comic book coming to life, the creators have succeeded in pulling you into their world. Unfortunately, that's where it ends. The story line is passable but mediocre at best. The characters are bland and for an animated multi-verse the villains are uninspired and unmemorable. I'm glad I saw this in a theatre in 3-D because at home on a small screen it will be like watching a Sunday morning cartoon. Albeit, one with a 90M budget.",7,3,8,29 December 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Underwhelming
","Unfortunately, this did not live up to the hype. Introducing new superheroes after Infinity Game reflects lazy writing. Fat Thor was a highlight and worth seeing but the final fight scene and climax were absolutely ridiculous and unimaginative. It's unbelievable how much a studio will spend on actors and advertising but not on dialing in the story line or making the defeat of the most powerful being in the universe believable. It will make tons of money but could have been so much better.",6,4,7,22 May 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," But How?
","Great cast and Amazing CGI. Story line has too many holes to even summarize. Fight scenes, especially with Thanos, are shockingly unimaginative. Where is the thoughtful use of each hero's superpowers to push Thanos to the brink of defeat? How many times is somebody going to try and hit him on the chin only for it to be shrugged off? C'mon. $300M+ budget needs to go into thoughtful writing like what as done with the depth of Thanos character to make this the masterpiece it should be. All that said. Solid 8 star and great movie. Could have been a real classic and not just a blockbuster.",8,1,4,24 April 2019
Ghost Rider," Aged like a 2 Buck Chuck
",Was this movie ever considered good? Hard to believe this was a Marvel Columbia Pictures effort. Do yourself a favor and pass.,2,0,1,14 March 2020
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Just OK
",A pleasant way to spend your evening. Nothing groundbreaking. Nothing great. Not terrible. That about sums it up.,6,0,2,1 September 2019
Ex Machina," Brilliant Once
","A powerful AI message, relevant philosophical questions and strong cinematography fill the core of this suspenseful sci-fi. The opening and close are weak and could be edited out. Unfortunately, watching this for a second time is like watching the Super Bowl over. No matter how good the game was, you already know the players and the ending. Without suspense, it just becomes rather boring which shows why it will never be a classic.",8,1,2,27 July 2019
The Adjustment Bureau," Don't be fooled
","If you are a sci-fi fan and are drawn toward films that have an imaginative or compelling thought about reality, alternate reality or fate this will not deliver. The plot and 'love will survive all odds' is just not well conceived. Even Matt Damon can't pull this out of the trash bin. Watcher Beware rating.",4,2,3,20 June 2019
The Matrix Reloaded," FAIL
","Let me preface this by saying The Matrix is my favorite movie of all time. It was revolutionary, groundbreaking and created more iconic fight scenes and visual effects than any movie up to that point or since. Where the Matrix succeeded Reloaded ripped it off, tarnished its memory and failed miserably. One is better off to watch the Matrix again than this. Be The One.",4,2,3,16 March 2019
Wonder Woman," I really tried to like this
","I went into this with no expectations and really wanting to enjoy the ride. Unfortunately, it was all downhill after the first ten minutes. The story line was fine with WWII but that's it. A good concept and setting can't make up for a poor script, bad acting, unrealistic battle scenes and lack of chemistry. Two thumbs down for this one. I can't imagine how this got ratings above an 8 or any awards.",5,5,10,26 June 2019
Annihilation," Sharknado without the laughs or storyline or shark
",Probably one of the worst sci-fi movies of the last 20 years. The 'idea' of the movie was fine. The acting and directing were terrible. Can't remember the last time I saw a movie completely devoid of character like this. The CGI of animals was laugh out loud comical. The 'Shimmer' and plant life may have looked better on the big screen but not at home. Somebody did a great job of conning Natalie Portman into this so I upped my score to a 2. Good thing this wasn't her first movie or she'd be waiting tables at IHOP now.,2,0,3,8 June 2018
The Nice Guys," Not your average detective movie
","1st I'm giving this movie an extra star for Russell Crowe gaining more weight than me in the last 5 years. Second, it's really good. Crowe and Gosling are naturals together. Nothing deep here, but really enjoyable and maybe too complicated story. Worth a watch.",8,1,2,28 June 2019
