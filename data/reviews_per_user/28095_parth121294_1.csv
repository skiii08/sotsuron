Iron Man 3," Read only if u r unbiased
","This iron man had a lot many glitches. The president was in the suit however he did not operate it and set himself free. The suit brought back president to the villain and ejected him there....if this is the case, with whom does the suits loyalty lie . If there's no question of loyalty, how was the villain able to control it. Moreover if tony stark could eject a death beam from his chest ( the arc reactor), there were many instants where he could have just killed the villain. How does the suit detect pepper pots when the transmitters are injected in Tony's hands.?if this Is the case, the suit should detect everyone who gets into that position even colonel Rhodes .There's even something else that disappointed me . The suspense of the villain was literally an insult. And they revealed it too early and as someone above stated, they revealed it in the form of comedy.( my own opinions )I am not against the movie. Many of the things were superb. The uber cool tech stuff and gadgets literally got me through the movie. And as always, the cast was far superb and dialog delivery of Robert was a cherry on the top.",6,2,5,26 April 2013
