E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Great ! but is it original ?
","In 1967, Satyajit Roy wrote a script for a film to be called The Alien, based on his short story Bankubabur Bandhu ('Banku Babu's Friend') which he wrote in 1962 for Sandesh, the Ray family magazine. The Alien had Columbia Pictures as producer for this planned U.S.-India co-production, and Peter Sellers and Marlon Brando as the leading actors. However, Ray was surprised to find that the script he had written had already been copyrighted and the fee appropriated by Mike Wilson. Wilson had initially approached Ray as an acquaintance of a mutual friend, Arthur C. Clarke, to represent him in Hollywood. The script Wilson had copyrighted was credited as Mike Wilson & Satyajit Ray, despite the fact that he only contributed a single word in it. Ray later stated that he never received a penny for the script. Brando later dropped out of the project, and though an attempt was made to replace him with James Coburn, Ray became disillusioned and returned to Calcutta. Columbia expressed interest in reviving the project several times in the 1970s and 1980s, but nothing came of it. When E.T. was released in 1982, Clarke and Ray saw similarities in the film to the earlier Alien script Â— Ray discussed the collapse of the project in a 1980 Sight & Sound feature, with further details revealed by Ray's biographer Andrew Robinson (in The Inner Eye, 1989). Ray believed that Spielberg's film would not have been possible without his script of The Alien being available throughout America in mimeographed copies (a charge Spielberg denies).-(on wikipedea).",9,1,2,27 December 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," Most over-hyped WAR story
","Mix a war story (civial war) with a fantasy world then put some essence of tragic drama and some Bollywood emotions, you will get this movie right. The film would not have been very different even if you have omitted the fantasy part. They seems to be disconnected somehow. The same old story of stepfather being unfriendly to a child and the child finds shelter in her fantasy. Can you imagine? that after being shot at back, a man can take off his glasses, wipe his nose and then fall down. No joke - the doctor did. Nobody knows why Mercedes left the Captain alive. If she can open his mouth wider, she could have cut his neck more easily. This is stupid, considering a war film. The the faun suddenly forgave her without any real reason (just like he was so harsh on the child who has completed the second task) and ask her to do the third task. It appears, the film is better to continue that way. How come the labyrinth, which opened up for the girl, also opened up for her step-father (when she was chased) ? Was it not that the fantasy world was only for the child? If her father can also enter her fantasy then everything would have been very different. The child died when she came out of the underworld, and that is why she has to take a rebirth to get back to her real father who was waiting for centuries. But at the end, the child has to die again to be reunited with her world. Is it not funny?",2,7,20,29 October 2008
Slumdog Millionaire," Poverty-porn sells good
","Its not surprising to win awards by selling poverty from developing nations, rather it is a cheap trick. This has been done from various others such as Satyajit Roy, Mrinal Sen from India and now Danny from Britain. I am not saying they were/are not good directors, but only when they make films on poverty their piece of art gets an award.An award is much dependent upon the jury members and their background. If the jury members were from developing nations it may not have been even noticed.It is perhaps not incorrect to say that some countries are poor because some others are rich. Giving awards for depicting so called reality would not serve any good to the real cause. It will only make someone richer by selling the poverty of someone else.'The whole build-up of hype around the movie reminds one of the new-found appreciation of Miss World and Miss Universe organisers towards Indian beauty after India's economy was liberalized to allow international cosmetic giants to sell their wares in India,'",1,64,122,20 January 2009
