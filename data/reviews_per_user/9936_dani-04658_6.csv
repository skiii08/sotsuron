First Man," It's not what I expected
","It's not what I expected. The action in the movie is developing too slowly. Visually, it is almost perfect, but the script and weak play of some actors alter it. I was expecting him to be in the battle for the Oscars, but even if he was nominated he would not be a real contender.",7,1,3,18 October 2018
Captain Marvel," A captain marvel review from a 20 years old white male
","Of course let's start with Captain Marvel's positives. Let's be honest Bri Larson is the perfect choice for this role. It really adds something special to the character. Overall, the whole crew 's acting was good. The visual effects were awesome , but everything good ends here. The tone had to be more serious, there were unnesesery jokes and some weird music not in place. Bad, but the for real bad directing cost this movie a lot. The guy who decided to employ these idiots for directors is the guy who has to be blamed. The script is also underdeveloped. It is clear that the film has been cut and many of the scenes have been re-recorded. I hope to fix the mistakes because indeed Brie and her captain Marvel have the potential to do something great.",6,1,3,10 March 2019
Aquaman," Briliant

The Prestige," Simply Christopher Nolan!
","The best director to ever do it. So well rounded, when a man knows what he is doing the results are obviousl. The scrips is 10/10 the acting is 10/10 the directing is 10/10. WATC IT YOU WANT REGRET IT.",9,3,5,22 September 2018
The Favourite," Way to weird
","If i had to describe the movie in one sentence, the sentence will be : Strange, weird porn from the 19th century. It clearly has an idea but it is not executed well enought. The acting of Emma is abive average but the others are just ok. It is a movie worth watching but nothing special, nothing for 10 oscar nominations.",8,2,3,22 February 2019
Wonder Woman," The best thing I have seen my whole life.
","Seeing that much criticism on this movie, makes me cry. This is absolutely the best superhero movie by far ,and the closest one to get an oscar nomination. I don't know why uso much people are embarrassing themselfs with their coments. MUST WATCH MOVIE!",10,5,7,22 September 2018
