The King's Speech," Each of us has his struggle
","A very well made movie: pace, acting, characterization and sets. What I liked the most is the fact that all of us have our own challenges in life. Being a King or royal family is no different and we have to fight them out in our own way. Great cinema, Mr. Rush takes the cake in terms of acting performance for me and the key contender for Oscar. Colin Firth was also really good and so was Helena Bonham Carter, both looking good for Oscars. Another great thing which was highlighted in the movie was dealing with fear. And how that becomes the core evil for most of our problems.A must watch for all cinema lovers.",9,1,3,6 February 2011
Black Swan," Brilliant one on second thoughts
","As soon as I finished this movie, I got up and thought just another 'psycho pi' stuff from Aronofsky. My next thought was why doesn't he make something like wrestler again. And then it just hit me 'quest of perfection', the mathematician chasing the meaning of Pi, and the wrestler who has to wrestle, as that is what is wants to do, even if he risks his life. There was a magical moment and I found the movie suddenly brilliant, and appreciated Aronofsky for his genius.I do not believe in extreme emotions, rather one has to take nothing so seriously which human being has created. And here is the brilliance of Aronofsky, he portrays the extreme and psychotic nature of human emotion, ambition and quest. At the end the movies communicate that this extreme nature is a labyrinth created by self, which is delusional in so many ways. The movie is about a young girl trying to a perfect ballerina, and everything should be perfect around it. She hallucinates and falls pray to her ambition. The acting is superb, the hard work in direction on ballet scenes and developing of movie is great. A must watch and I guess a high chance of Oscar for Natalie Portman.I still feel its time Aronofsky makes a different movie, rather than the extreme emotions. I think Pi was his greatest movie, it is like how Wrestler and Crazy Heart are similar movies, but Crazy Heart has a neutral/positive spin at the end. I am not looking for a positive ending, just a different kind of brilliance from him.",8,1,4,26 December 2010
Inglourious Basterds," Brilliance, pace and style
","Entertaining feature films is sign of Tarantino, and this is it. But the brilliance comes from christoph waltz, what amazing actor, the De Nero looks, and equal to the task, deserves the best actor at Cannes, and I guess should get an Oscar nomination. The movie's pace, cinematography, sets, different languages in different scenes and overall screenplay is very good. To start off, I felt the movie had a bit of drag with Jew and German hatred for each other gets cruel and the part with 'bear jew' and 'jew hunter'. But Tarantino was fast to bring changes as chapters went along, and was able to close the loop well in the end. Again the vindication part in question, is settled by different objectives to kill Hitler in the movie, which made it brilliant in my opinion. My favorite scene is where I guess Tarantino is a magician, when the British officer gets caught with a 'not so great' German accent, and then he starts speaking English, super stylish, hats off to Tarantino, style is his middle name.The only little not so favorable thing about the movie was German hair getting scalped and carving the swastika sign, and all. I somehow feel Hate begets hate, what Hitler did was atrocious, that doesn't mean he should be followed back.",8,1,6,29 August 2009
Kick-Ass," Good Watch for its a Fantasy Movie
","OK, it is not an 8.3, and could be at best a 4, but I have given it a 7, and have my reasons. It is like when movies business started, people went to 'talkies' to see some entertainment, something unreal with which they can relate their fantasies and dreams. I generally watch serious movies with characters, story and the way the movie builds, and the message. It is like in a discussion between Scorsese and Spielberg, Scorsese said, I try to start from the very atom and then keep pulling my camera up to 30,000 feet to get a broader picture, the micro to the macro and vice versa. This is not that kind of movie, this is a movie for fun, fantasy and a laugh, if you can. It doesn't develop, its storyline is weak, and has no continuity, but its fun, and at some level captures modern world with internet, people not helping each other, rather filming them and so on. Our Superhero Kick-ass is a lovable character, and he gets lost all the time, and tries to get simple things in life, for example once he finds love in life, he forgets about the Superhero dreams. The movie has its moments, and becomes like the spy kids thing with the 11 year old hitting out all the bad guys. But here is my problem beyond just enjoying the movie, it can be a bad influence, especially the scene wherein Nick Cage tries out bullets on his 11 year old, and some of the gun fight scenes.Overall, if you can take a movie as a fantasy, you can give it a shot, fun at best, good 2 hrs spend, but it is no 'watchmen', which is my favorite superhero movie.",7,3,9,16 May 2010
