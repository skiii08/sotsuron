Requiem for a Dream," A beautiful and amazing movie
","Wow! That is my first response after finishing 'Requiem for a Dream'. This is a haunting, unbelievable movie that will sit with you for days. After so much shallow garbage that is presented to us, it is good to see a character driven, non-derivative movie come our way. One of the most overlooked aspects of this movie is the love between Harry Goldfarb and Marion Silver.It is so beautiful, yet you know within the tragedy that lies before them, making it that much more painful. If you have any respect for film, watch this movie and be amazed. While it is not easy to watch, it is something you will love, and will never want to forget.",Null,0,0,25 June 2001
