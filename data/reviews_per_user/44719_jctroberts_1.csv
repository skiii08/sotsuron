Blade Runner 2049," Masterpiece of Cinematography
","This is not the usual dross you'll find watching Super Hero Marvel or re-hash Alien trilogy or 'shoot em up', kick-ass movies that are doled out ten a penny. This is a masterpiece of cinematography a delight to the eye and yes if you listen and pay attention a great story line. It's not the original of thirty years back either, in it's own right a classic, but a nob towards a great sequel. I only hope they don't make a third installment, it doesn't need it and should be now left alone.",10,3,10,16 October 2017
