Source Code," Interesting film, interesting ideas, recommend...
","This film was very interesting, it's for people who likes scientific, fantastic and mystic genre. Main idea was that there are parallel dimensions and these dimensions are made by the time. Every moment has its own logical extension and we cannot change time or move between these dimensions, but it's very interesting what would be if we can? In Duncan Jones' opinion we can change somethings in the past, this develops new future, which would be the independent from other future (where from we've applied changes). I think there were 3 different demotions in this film: first it was saved Chicago, Second was place were Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan) are together and third was demotion where Christina Warren receive message. I thing all three dimensions would have its own extension. But... When I saw this film I liked but also I had strange felling (negative). I agree users who thinks Source Code is mix of some films like: Groundhog Day; Sliding Doors; Blind Chance; Johnny Got His Gun etc. Also Colter Stevens take a place of Sean Fentress, but where is Sean? How did he disappear? I think this fact abrogates balance.",7,1,3,15 May 2015
