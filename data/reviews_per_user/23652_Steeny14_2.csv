Marie Antoinette," Truly Decadent
","A perfect portrait of the ill fated queen using a punk soundtrack and beautiful photography in Coppolas almost high school teen movie style translation to capture the spirit of this truly iconic figure who was just a girl who just wanted to have fun. Instantly became my favourite film. I am already a big fan of Sofia Coppola, this film takes her already prevalent themes of fun loving young girls repressed by the systems around her, be it commitment or parents, isolation in their position, rebellion all put across by a punk/indie soundtrack (chosen by Brian Reitzell) and beautiful photography (by Lance Acord). She seems to sum up what it is to be young so very perfectly, to be able to break away from the systems that hold you down and let loose. I see her as one of the filmmakers around at the moment who is carrying on the 'new Hollywood' movement that her dad was a part of during the 70's with the very style that she has. An extremely underrated film, seen as self indulgent and having a very slim plot. They are reading it wrong, it owes more to art cinema in containing the huge plot in the coding, style, photography and mise en scene. The critics will come back to look at this one. More significant than its been received.",10,2,4,19 December 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," Great for comic book fans
","I was looking forward to this film for ages as a comic book fan, seeing Angel, Beast, Colossus and all the other new guys. I was not disappointed, as a comic book fan. As a movie, it is probably the weakest of the three. It's the most action packed, and it has the most stuff that comic fans would love, it is the best of the three for X-men fans. But the new director doesn't take his time like Bryan Singer did and he found it hard to deal with all the characters, so the character development suffered. So if your a fan of the X-men comics you wont be disappointed, but this isn't the intelligent movie that we expect from the first two.",10,2,6,26 May 2006
