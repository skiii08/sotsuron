Insidious: Chapter 2," Had potential but
","Great concept. But while watching it a few minutes ago, I had to keep adjusting the volume. Very low dialogue. Very loud noises and jump scares. Very annoying. I shouldn't have to adjust the volume 20-30 times in 5 minutes. Also, the characters aren't the smartest. Specs. They were listening to a conversation, and should've moved in way earlier than they did, to prevent something. I hate bad writing. As in, writing preventable mistakes or making smart characters do dumb things to further a movie. Also, a Tranquelizer gun is better than a syringe. I was watching the movie at 1am, and had to stop because I didn't want to disturb my neighbors. I hate movies that have low dialogue and extremely obnoxious, loud noises. Great concept, just some annoying flaws in the audio and writing.",7,0,1,28 March 2019
Vertigo," Creepy, Possessive and Obsessive. Also Stalkerish
","In today's overly sensitive world, a man acting like james Stewart in this film would've been arrested, pepper sprayed and/or shot. Why couldn't he just love Her for Who she was? Because it wouldn't be a Hitchcock film. She should've been stronger with herself. Why didn't Alfred Hitchcock ever win an academy award for directing? The academy voters were really snobby back then. Great film. Tragic, and unfortunate for their potential love.",10,1,4,12 March 2018
Van Helsing," Where are the black people?
","Zero black people? Lol. I'm half black, but honestly, I don't mind. It's not like it was racist Woody Allen purposefully snubbing black actors in his movies. The acting isn't the best in this movie. Almost every line is cliche and corny, from Dracula and others. But Dracula's brides are HOT! And the only thing that can kill him is a werewolf? I want to be Dracula! Anyway, I hate nbc/Comcast so I try to avoid universal but I like the sentimentality of the film, horror genre, and the opening of the film. I used to put my dvd of van heksing in my Xbox and just play it, and go to sleep. I also did the same with Halloween H20, and Batman animated series Mask of the Phantasm, so, it's not an insult to the films, they just calm me for bed. I want to be DRACULA!",9,0,5,17 March 2019
Dunkirk," Yay! Let's watch soldiers flee like cowards!
","The Germans Won at Dunkirk! It was embarrassing loss for the Allies, mainly the British. Why would anybody make a film about an embarrassing British loss? Maybe a German director, but why would a British director want to portray such a masochistic loss? I don't like losing when I play video games. I don't like watching cowards run away. And some of the coward British soldiers called a fleeing French soldier a coward! And who let Harry Styles in this movie?! I had many reasons to avoid paying to see this in cinema! Glad I didn't waste money. Watching it on demand in hbo right now. It's very boring and laborious. One thing I know, don't get on a ship. And the dumb Brits rescuing Brit soldiers from water actually go BACK to the war! Without weapons! That's absurd! Be brave, but be smart, too! The Germans should've sent Straffing planes to kill the soldiers. Stuka only gets points like bridges and ships, but strafers get the infantry kills. This battle was an epic win for the Germans! Why would anybody make a film about this? Maybe a documentary, but a film? Again, this battle was a loss for the British. Making a film about a losing battle is risky. I guess if you're british and love England, you'll like it, but it's still a loss. Harry styles? I gave it a 3 stars because the cinematography and other Details are quality! But it's a very tedious and laborious film. I guess if you like the German side in this war, you'll like the movie, but you'll get bored, too! It would've been great if Joker and Batman and Bane came into the film. That would've made it entertaining. I'm Joking. As a history fanatic with this war, I already knew Dunkirk was unworthy for a film. And if you see the non stop retreating and cowering, you'll get bored, unless you love Seeing men retreat and show cowardice. I'm reiterating the same points, but that's what this film did. Reiterate a big allied loss scene by scene, minute by minute.",3,1,4,8 June 2018
Moulin Rouge!," Overrated and tedious to watch.
","It's a love story. I LOVE Nicole Kidman! But aside from Her, this film does nothing for me. All the music nd singing hurts my ears and brain. It's not a bad movie but definitely not deserving of the hype and academy awards. Without Nicole Kidman's beauty and Her exuding Her great emotions, I wouldn't care about this movie. She is so BEAUTIFUL and Exudes such sensuality and affection that it's easy to fall in love with Her. I want Her! I want to go back to 2001, and be in this movie and make love with her in the movie! But I can't watch this movie more than once because of all the music and singing and crying. If Roxanne is a Prostitute, She's the type that You fall in love with and want all to yourself! I guess I think like the movie's villain. But can you blame Him for wanting Her all to himself?! Nope! I WANT YOU, NICOLE KIDMAN! But I can't watch this movie more than the one time I did a few years ago. It's too tedious. Maybe it's a good film, i just don't understand all the hype. It's sad Roxanne dies. Tuberculosis was no joke. But now, it's no threat. Too bad Roxanne didn't wait a few years! She'd have a cure to that TB and be living Her best life! Sadly, Not with me. I wasn't born then.",5,1,3,16 September 2019
The Hangover Part II," This movie is so dumb!
","Alan, Tracy and Doug are all why bad things happened in this dumb movie! Doug's ugly and annoying wife begged Doug to bring her dumb brother and he did. Alan drugged everybody EXCEPT Doug and his dumb wife. Doug and his dumb wife are confused about what happened. They never know! This movie sucks! The most annoying part of the movie is how Doug's DUMB WIFE begged to include her stupid brother and her brother causes the mayhem. That isn't funny! That's DUMB and preventable! Glad I didn't waste money on this movie. So dumb! Alan isn't funny he's dumb. Tracy or whatever dougs wife is, also dumb. Stu should've blamed her and Doug and Tracy for what happened but he didn't. This movie sucks! Zach gala whatever isn't funny. He's dumb. Well, his character is. Still, this movie is dumb! I hate Tracy and Doug and Alan.",2,1,2,14 May 2020
Drag Me to Hell," Audio and female lead are very annoying!
","Great concept, great director but the female lead is so annoying! She's dumb and her screaming is so annoying! Have to adjust the volume 1000 times because it's so loud. Very cool concept but she's dumb and annoying and not pretty enough to be that annoying and dumb. This movie is more gross than scary but if you put yourself in the movie, you'd be very scared in those same circumstances. But it's so gross. If you're trying to eat dinner while watching, don't unless you like being grossed out. I'm not sure casting is the issue. Casting CAN make or break a project but I think it's definitely the female lead who annoys me.And what idiot collects coins and puts them in a blank envelope?! That's a flaw but I guess you have to end it. And then the idiot annoying girl jumps on a train track? Idiot! When she dies, I am glad. It might be the actress. Wasn't going to say it but she may be the reason her character annoys me. Her screaming is so annoying! Great concept, just really annoying audio and female screaming. Lol.",6,0,1,14 May 2020
The Reader," I want Kate Winslet's character To teach me things.
","Powerful film! Decisions Michael made were disappointing in that he could've SAVED Her! A hug. Telling the court Hanna could barely write and couldn't read. Why would she be so selfish or proud to go without honesty in that moment, to take the fall, to never see how far and deep She and Michael could've gone, as to not reveal her illiteracy? Michael was young and felt peer pressure to hate Her, but He could've saved Her in that court room. Modern day, Americans call anybody that disagrees with liberal ideology a Nazi or fascist. They will shout down free speech and call anybody a Nazi. But do they even know who the nazis were? I doubt Hanna was even a member of the NASDP. SS Guard, but illiterate?! I highly doubt an illiterate person would be a member of the Nazi party. Most people don't realize that detail. You can be a camp guard but not a Nazi. You can be a 16 year old WAFFEN SS soldier fighting in battle against the red army, but not even a member of the NASDP. Most Americans get their American version of the war. Russians and Brits get there versions. They're all different. Most Americans think all Germans were evil nazis. There are uneducated video games with 'Nazi zombies' but where is the accurate history? Germany, there are laws that ban the imagery of swastika. Video game developers can't even add the symbol in the game. It's history and very important to be documented. I'm Half Black and I want to see swastikas in WW2 video games and other documentations. How will we see the past accurately? How will we discern good from bad? Learn from mistakes? Again, most young American liberal minded types will call anything and anybody a Nazi. I'm half black, and they'll call me a Nazi before seeing my skin tone. This is what happens when free speech is stifled and when guilty feeling governments repress historic symbols like the swastika from even video games, or old WAFFEN SS uniforms. How can people demand progress if they hide the past? How can people correct mistakes if they can't see what they were? This is what happens when the German government bans historic documents, and hinders understanding of even their dark and shameful past. I'm from the same city where Dr. Martin Luther King jr was killed. My city doesn't hide that. They have a museum. They remind people. What I see happening in Europe where free speech is being stifled, it's only setting the world up for more of the bad from history. I'm mentioning this because it correlates to the guilt and fear Michael felt in that courtroom from speaking the TRUTH to save the Woman HE LOVED out of fear of backlash from the angry victims and others in that courtroom. People he might've relied on as Clients. I understand the reasons, but it's always sad to see the TRUTH die in fear. Even if it's to save a former SS camp guard. I think most people can relate to the connection Michael and Hanna Had. When I saw Hanna teaching Michael how to make love with Her, I envied Michael! The pictures of female SS camp guards aren't very flattering. Most were unattractive. Only one was young and beautiful, Irma Grese! Aside from Her, all the female SS guards were scary looking. Maybe Kate winslett was an accurate portrayal of a female SS camp guard, but maybe not. I'll just say, if they looked like Her, I'd willingly go to camp. I knew the outcome of Hanna. I knew When Michael visited her how things would end. He could've hugged her. Maybe he wasn't ready to re connect. I'm surprised there were no flashback scenes to the 1940's. Most other stories would've included visualizing those times. The main detail I couldn't believe was how an adult living in Germany could be ILLITERATE! Wow! I guess I don't know everything about the Germans from that war. And I've done years of research, more than the average American, regarding that war and the Military factions of Nazi Germany. I wanted Michael to save her, but it didn't happen. I couldn't help but fall in Love with Hanna. She was very lovable, despite her past. When She said she only remembered the past at trial, I guess it's possible her past wasn't emulated in her when Michael met Her. He Saw Her goodness. I think everybody that calls Anybody a Nazi, and stifles free speech should watch this film. The film left me with more questions than answers, but that's okay. I'm thinking. If only everybody could think and remember and learn from the past mistakes. And learn from what works. Hanna didn't teach me how to make love with a Woman, but She made me see the goodness in Her and how everybody can be both good and bad. We all have choices to make. CHOICES! Not talking about her Choices, but choices in general. What's the right choice?",10,2,4,24 April 2018
