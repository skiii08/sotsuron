The Monuments Men," Great story. Well made. Great cast. Bad script.
","This is a great story. This is also a terrible screenplay. It runs like a filmed first draft. There's no sense of pacing, character and it's completely tone deaf. It's one disconnected scene after another. Some are comical in tone, others are somber, some are sentimental -- this one is a real head scratcher. It's a very well made film, with some great visuals and attention to period detail, but with such a discombobulated script it's a frustrating experience to sit through. Damon and Blanchett randomly meeting each other at an abandoned Jewish home, where he is returning a stolen painting is a contrivance the size of Europe. There are some deaths in the film that barely register as anything more than a reference by other characters - they are so sloppily done and dramatically inert. This film has the right cast, the right crew behind the camera, but this episodic script was not in any condition to be shot.",5,0,0,2 May 2014
Requiem for a Dream," Drama reaches hysterical heights
","Before Darren Arnofsky found his footing as a strong director, namely Pi, but especially Requiem for a Dream felt like film school exercises. Whatever little substance there might be is crushed under the weight of a director who throws split screens, frame rate effects, cameras mounted to the actors, fisheye lenses inches away from faces and an endless grab bag of visual gimmicks that sits uncomfortably between amateurish and pretentious. The director is the star here and the film suffers from it. The characters are about as fleshed out as your standard uninteresting junkie usually is and while Ellen Burstyn gives a decent performance with this material, her downward trajectory as a diet pill popping old lady who wants to be on television - is so over the top that it becomes almost comedic. The characters are never engaging and watching these cardboard cutouts on a hardcore afterschool special path of self destruction, is no more substantive than watching a young director play in a new sandbox with all the split screens and gimmicks at his disposal.",1,2,6,23 September 2014
Sucker Punch," Yikes!
","A toxic blend of music video and video game set the tone for this juvenile bore, about a girl thrown in a mental institution and retreats into her mind - which happens to be the mind of a 12 year old boy who loves overblown CG action and hot girls in minimal, tight clothing. Zack Synder made a colossal miscalculation directing this picture. It's many steps backward from his previous film Watchmen and he seems proud of Sucker Punch's lack of substance so he can indulge his love of video game fetishistic action. Sucker Punch is as light as a feather -- it's a couple of disconnected cartoon action sequences bookended with a few scenes at a mental institution. This is the kind of indulgent train wreck that can derail careers and since Synder came away from this stinker with his career intact, I can only hope he got this crap out of his system and will never repeat the mistakes he made with Sucker Punch.",3,3,10,28 May 2014
The Equalizer," By the numbers, generic paycheck film for all involved
","Denzel Washington brings nothing but his availability to show up and sleepwalk through filming, playing a character that requires practically nothing from the man but look serious. This is a step up in craft from director Antoine Fuqua's previous film, the sloppy Olympus Has Fallen, but despite being competently made, The Equalizer feels like lazy paycheck work. There's nothing that you haven't seen a million times before here and the generic story unfolds without so much as a single surprise - this is by the numbers stuff. It's not a chore to sit through, which is about the highest compliment I can give it, but the second any character is introduced, you know exactly how they will be used in the plot and their fate - they are either simply good or bad, no development beyond that. Add to that a horribly miscast Chloë Grace Moretz. Despite an ending you can see 10 minutes into its bloated 132 minute running time, a tacked on set up for a future franchise of more vigilantism feels forced and undeserving. Can't wait for his next adventure against a group of ethnic clichés, who wronged a hapless girl, while he's trying to make good at a dead end job.",4,7,12,15 December 2014
Gravity," Special effects that are truly special and dialogue in special need of being reworked
","Gravity is a film written around six long scenes that are directed with technical perfection and padded with scenes that are always well done - but anchored down by expository dialogue completely unnecessary in a survival film with one character who just can't seem to either stop talking to herself or informing us very, very slow audience members about her perilous situation. Any film would be lucky to have a great sequence and Gravity has half a dozen of them and they are usually sustained by shots that don't contain a single edit for minutes at a time. There is so much in this film that is great and worthy of repeated viewing, but the whole is less than the sum of its great parts. The opening 13 minute unbroken shot is not only a technical accomplishment, but sets up this narrative without ever feeling like a gimmick or a shot designed to bring attention to itself. When Stone gets the Soyuz parachute tangled and the debris takes out the ISS, it's one of the most spectacular destruction scenes ever filmed. The simple structure for Gravity perfectly suits the film, but some cringe inducing dialogue needed a serious rewrite. There's too much that's fantastic in Gravity to let any criticisms deter a viewing. Highly recommended.",7,1,2,26 October 2014
Fury," Grim and well made.
","After the incredibly stupid and incompetent film Sabotage, David Ayer returns to screens only a few months later with the well crafted Fury. It's a major return to form for Ayer and this grim, gory tale of a small crew commanding a tank during the end of WWII is a worthy submission to the genre. For about the first hour, the film is all business, a relentless onslaught of one gruesome situation after another and the heavy toll it's taken on our leads. The film stumbles a bit when things quiet down for an extended sequence in a German civilian home, where getting a cooked meal turns into a difficult time, when civility is absent from most of the crew. It felt like it was inspired from the French plantation sequence that was reinstated in Apocalypse Now Redux - but the story in Fury is just too lean and small in scope to withstand a narrative detour like that. The cast is uniformly excellent, with the exception of Jon Bernthal who overplays his role as a broad cliché, who never feels human. Fury doesn't quite pull off the ending, but there's enough quality filmmaking throughout to recommend the film.",7,1,4,31 December 2014
The Maze Runner," Holds your attention
","Another entry in the dystopian young adult machine that pumps these out in hopes of striking gold with a franchise - The Maze Runner is derivative stuff, but it's serviceable entertainment that is successful in its storytelling more often than not. In the process of trying to build a franchise, most of these types of films feel narratively incomplete, as they try to arc a thin story over a series of films - but The Maze Runner feels like it can stand on its own, even if the end is completely botched. The cast is decent enough and it's refreshing to see grime and dirt on actors in an appropriate setting, instead of perfect hair and makeup. The film wastes no time, as the first scene drops our lead character Thomas into this small community of youngsters, which is surrounded by a giant, deadly maze. The maze is an interesting visual effect and the inside is a good combination of sets and vfx. The maze is far more interesting than most of dialogue that takes place outside of it. The first 45 minutes or so are interesting as we try to figure out the why's and what's, but the young adult subgenre insistence of giving silly names to everything can come across hokey. 'We call them Grievers' 'We call this The Glade.' Even with the worst incidences of of expository dialogue, the cast is skilled enough for the film to keep its dignity. The last few minutes of the film fall apart, as an inevitable sequel is set up and whether this ending is true to its source material or not, it simply doesn't work on screen. It's an eye rolling ending for sure, but it doesn't sour everything that came before it.",6,0,2,5 December 2014
The Impossible," Terrific spectacle and decent drama
","There is something a little unsavory about following one privileged white family through the hellish aftermath of the Indian Ocean Tsunami, but there's more than enough good material to counter any feelings of whitewashing. The recreation of the tsunami is a marvel of visual effects, combining miniatures and digital elements that must have been grueling to film and the result is a technical masterstroke. Its spectacle is both stunning and frightening and director Juan Antonio Bayona stages this mayhem with a brilliant eye. He holds shots without cutting quickly and even with his characters being tossed around from the water, the action is made of well composed shots that are never difficult to tell what is happening. Watts spends most of the film on a bed rotting, but manages to pull out a great performance, where she could have easily over done it and hammed it up. Newcomer Tom Holland (no, not the horror director) also does a fantastic job as Watts' young son. The Impossible spends most of its running time in a hospital, as tourists and locals search and mourn for their loved ones and while the film occasionally enters 'inspirational' territory, it never goes too far to become cloying and sentimental. There's enough quality filmmaking here to highly recommend The Impossible.",7,0,1,18 July 2014
The Babadook," The film dies at the hour mark and gets sillier and sillier
","The Babadook is a well crafted film that manages to ratchet up some decent suspense, mystery and even some scares, until the thin narrative runs out of steam. The last half hour devolves into a cheap horror show that produces unintentional laughs, as the story disintegrates on screen. The Babadook just doesn't sustain as a feature length film. Essie Davis is excellent as the lead and she commits herself to this material and her fantastic performance keeps the film watchable. Child actor Noah Wiseman isn't as successful, as the boy can be competent in some scenes and so grating in others, you'll need the mute button handy. His performance could have been shaped slightly better and certainly less irritating through editing, but as cruel as it sounds, it's an annoying kid performance. Even with all of its shortcomings, The Babadook is a nice showcase of talent for a first time director and I look forward to her next project.",4,10,30,18 December 2014
MASH," An undisciplined masterpiece
","MASH is an occasionally mean spirited, but almost entirely hilarious comedy about army medical personnel whose days usually involve various degrees of bad behavior to keep sane during the Korean War. Cocktails, beer and pranks accompany most scenes and Sutherland and Gould lead a great ensemble full of wit and improv. For all of the on set drama between Sutherland and Gould butting heads with director Altman, none of that seeped into their performances, which are sharp and in perfect tune to the tone of the film. MASH is a mostly shapeless film, with some truly bizarre narrative detours that perfectly encapsulate just how unstructured, random and absurd days in this field hospital can be. Almost 45 years later and it still feels fresh, spontaneous and an undisciplined masterpiece.",10,0,2,6 September 2014
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Right off the assembly line
","Straight off the Marvel assembly line, Captain America: Winter Soldier has a convoluted plot about S.H.I.E.L.D being compromised and a mysterious villainous soldier who has a link to Rogers' past. A half assed attempt at subversive material about surveillance, is a couple of throwaway lines of dialogue. A sequence showing a Captain America exhibit at a museum, is a poor expository recap of parts of the first film and why Rogers would show up to an exhibit of himself so he can be reminded of his own past is forced and silly. Who needs memories when you have a narrator and museum artifacts to remind yourself what your purpose is. The new addition to this material is Anthony Mackie who is forced into this story like a jagged puzzle piece. In typical Marvel fashion, the third act is generic action that takes over the narrative. Very little of it is exciting or practically staged - it's mostly animation and feels pre-visualized by committee filmmaking and has no real vision. A soul deadening scene at an Apple store add to the assembly line feel. This is featherweight stuff that's easy enough to sit through, but it feels more like a product than a film and takes absolutely no chances.",5,3,5,7 August 2014
Interstellar," Isn't always successful, but there's enough quality filmmaking on display to recommend
","There are some undeniably striking images in Interstellar, but far to often they are accompanied by silly grandiose dialogue and there's some questionable plotting throughout - the film definitely bites off more than it can chew, but there's enough good filmmaking and spectacle on display to get through the bumps along the way. Once in space, our leads have a few planets to explore to see if they are hospitable for human colonization and due to questionable plotting, the first planet they choose is the most threatening to their mission. Each hour on the planet is about 7 years on earth and of course, this is presented as a dramatic narrative countdown clock device and human stupidity all but ensures something will go wrong. Anne Hathaway's character foolishly wonders out in search of data until it is too late and finally a robot is sent after her and grabs her in seconds. Why the robot wasn't sent out to begin with so they don't burn time is a lazy ploy to up the dramatic stakes. This is soon followed by a dialogue exchange of what planet to explore next and Hathaway's love is on one planet, so naturally they decide to explore the other. With these people out to save mankind, it's amazing they made it past the moon without compromising the mission. What follows, should be left to the viewer to discover without giving away anything. However, the last act is a very watchable mess - a bizarre mix of sentiment and odd imagery that doesn't work. Interstellar isn't the most successful film, but it commands your attention throughout its long running time.",6,1,2,7 December 2014
Nightcrawler," A fun and nasty demented comedy
","A satire of sorts on local TV news and the bottom feeders they hire to film human suffering and death, Nightcrawler is a vicious and deranged black comedy. Jake Gyllenhaal does a fantastic job as an amoral sociopath who is far too committed to his work as a freelance videographer who films whatever graphic carnage he can and sells it to the local scuzzy news program who's ratings depend on this garbage. Rene Russo runs the late shift and her character and Gyllenhaal's develop an unhealthy dependency on each other, until it tilts in Gyllenhaal's favor to icky results. Russo, who has been absent from screens for the better part of this decade, turns in a sharp performance that she modulates almost perfectly as a past her prime news director just trying to stay in the cesspool of early morning news. These characters have no redeeming value and the film mines comedy from them reducing the worst, most horrific crime to a hefty payday or ratings. Cinematographer Robert Elswit films LA in a sickly, almost diseased way and director Dan Gilroy keeps the tone demented throughout as we watch Louis Bloom - who seems to be channeling some shades of Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver - plummet down to some truly grievous depths. Nightcrawler is a cynical film that has the guts to never cop out on its repugnant subject matter.",7,2,6,31 October 2014
Oblivion," Doesn't have an original idea in its entire bloated running time
","After a studio bidding war for director Joseph Kosinski's incomplete graphic novel, I can only image the pitch he gave - a mash up of every damn sci-fi film, some Wall-e, visual cues from 2001, Independence Day, Planet of the Apes, Blade Runner and so on. Oblivion is a tedious experience that just makes you want to revisit the much better films it borrows from. Tom Cruise is in his comfort zone here, and he's fine enough playing a typical Tom Cruise character. As evidenced from his previous film, Kosinski can't direct women or write for women, he just takes some generic hotties and projects some immature inner geek onto them either being bad-asses or just eye candy. It's always nice to see babes with perfect hair and lipstick and make-up running around in an apocalyptic setting. Morgan Freeman provides some much needed comedy in this otherwise dour film, though it should be noted that comedy is unintentional and his performance ranks up there with his previous sci-fi film Dreamcatcher. The film is slick looking, but relatively bland and the art direction looks like it took cues from an over sized apple store. There is some nice location work, with some CG elements carefully blended in, but beyond that, there's very little to recommend in Oblivion.",4,1,2,6 June 2014
Man of Steel," Good enough
","Well made and infinitely better than Zack Snyder's previous disaster Sucker Punch, the film has a great start on Krypton and then hits some narrative bumps as it shows us flashbacks of Clark's childhood. It's a bunch of vignettes that show us only the important stuff that shaped Clark into the man he will become. Being spoon-fed this origin content is basically pointless, as the Clark Kent we see all grown up fighting for what he believes in and protecting what he believes in speaks volumes and we can come to the conclusion about his back story ourselves. The usually reliable Amy Adams makes a not very believable Lois Lane and while she's not bad by any means, she comes across miscast. Henry Cavill fits the bill and is a strong enough presence on screen, where the previous Clark Kent in the unsuccessful Superman Returns Brandon Routh was like watching a black hole on screen. The action is miles over the top, with some great effects leveling Metropolis. A minor gripe is some soul deadening overt product placement that cheapens some scenes. Fighting in IHOP, 7-11, SEARS - I'm glad to know the fictitious city of Metropolis has the same annoying franchises. The action climaxes for about 20 minutes too long and becomes disaster porn and watching the 50th skyscraper crumble becomes a bit monotonous, but overall Man of Steel is a good watch and the money spent is clearly on screen.",6,2,3,28 May 2014
Divergent," YA Dystopia
","This boneheaded blunt force allegorical tale about a teen with the ability to think with free will, which is dangerous in this dystopian society, is too derivative to swallow. Divergent is tailor made for the least discerning teen viewer, who likes their characters a bit less than one dimensional and their romances telegraphed with all the artistry of a daytime soap. The attempt to class up these proceedings with what amounts to an extended cameo by Kate Winslet backfires with her villainous role, that even she can't transcend with this cornball material. Shailene Woodley barely registers as a presence, has no charisma and can't carry this film. She brings nothing to her role and you have to demolish suspension of disbelief to accept her as a young woman who can handle herself in action. The effects are adequate, with the exception of a zip line sequence through some run down skyscrapers, that serves no narrative purpose but to show off some effects they didn't have the money to do correctly. Running at about two hours and twenty minutes, Divergent begins with our main character having to make the most important decision of her life by choosing her faction - but there's no suspense or compelling material watching an undeveloped character go through this. The narrative then becomes an endless series of training sequences, before rushing into a last act that feels like an entire sequel condensed into a climax. With so little substance, it's going to be an insurmountable task to make this a running series of films that won't be instantly crushed under the weight of its own flimsy premise.",4,3,6,23 July 2014
The Lego Movie," Stimulation overkill, but still enjoyable.
","The Lego Movie is an odd blend of energy and color wrapped around a paper thin narrative. Most of the film is an unhinged series of very busy visuals with lots and lots of noise - stimulation overkill. I could imagine the psychotic effects this would have on a child watching before bedtime, possibly something along the lines of the child ingesting Strychnine and a bottle of No-Doze. The Lego Movie can be an exhausting film to watch, but more often than not, the film is charming enough without pandering to children. It does transcend its corporate shackles, in what could have easily been a feature length toy commercial in lesser hands, but Phil Lord and Christopher Miller give enough soul to this material. The film is a lot easier to enjoy on a visceral level, as these silly lego characters don't really engage and the voice work is well cast and deliver their readings with enough wit. While not exactly deep subversive satire, The Lego Movie does have just enough substance beneath all the noise.",6,1,3,30 December 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Bryan Singer gets this series back on track
","After Singer's last film, the box office fiasco and poorly done Jack the Giant Slayer, Singer shows a command of his craft that has been missing from his big budget work since he left this series in X2. The film starts out in a hostile future where the robotic Sentinels hunt down and wipe out what's left of the mutants. Either this film is purposely ignoring most of X3: The Last Stand or there's some glaring continuity oversights in this series, such as Professor X being alive in this grim future. But Days of Future past has a strong enough narrative to stand on its own, so it's easy to ignore events from the previous entries without impacting this film. Things get going when Wolverine is sent back to the 70s to seek the aid of a younger Professor X and Magneto to change the course of history. Even with crossover casting, time travel and mutants entrenched in powerful political positions, Days of Future Past is remarkably straight forward and well written and never gets convoluted with so many characters and plot threads. The money spent is up there on the screen and even with this colossal budget, the effects and action set pieces aren't overproduced, but remarkably well rendered and the period detail is more than convincing. The 3D was adequate, but didn't add anything to the experience except a few extra dollars to the ticket - two dimensions are more than enough for Days of Future Past.",7,0,1,3 July 2014
Non-Stop," Red Herring on a Plane
","Hack director Jaume Collet-Serra's red herring film about a mystery passenger on a commercial flight who wants money or he/she is going to kill someone every 20 minutes and only a drunkard air marshal played by Neeson can save everyone on board. Everything you need to know about Neeson's barely one dimensional character is in the first scene of the movie. He stares despondently at a bottle of whiskey, so the man's an alcoholic. He stares into further despondency at a picture of a little girl, obviously his daughter - who's obviously a link to why he's staring into that bottle of whiskey. Top notch writing. This is also one of those films that writes itself into a corner. Every character could be or couldn't be the maniac pulling the strings and the resolution comes at no surprise, because it literally could be anyone. They could have filmed thirty different endings - each ending changing the villain and personal motivation and the preceding events wouldn't have to change a single frame and the outcome would be exactly the same. Neeson gets worked up and huffy and puffy and punches a few people, but other than that, barely anything of interest happens.",4,9,17,26 May 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," An enjoyable yarn
","As someone who usually can't sit through a Wes Anderson film without the urge to gouge my eyes out, this was a surprisingly painless experience. Sure, his obnoxious camera work and aristocratic narrative nonsense is in full swing here, but Anderson keeps this yarn relatively straightforward and avoids his usual quirky non sequiturs. The art direction is gorgeous to look at and this story book film works because of the structure of the yarn. The teller of the tale is F. Murray Abraham, who gives a nice performance, but this is a Wes Anderson film after all, so while there are a few moments of honesty, this is mostly a madcap farce filled to the brim with broad characters. It's all surface, style, lightweight stuff and doesn't have a millimeter of depth, but this over directed film is Anderson's most entertaining film in quite some time.",6,0,2,19 July 2014
1941," Funny undisciplined nonsense
","Spielberg cranks things up to about a 14 out of 10, with this overstuffed lunacy about California thrown into hysterics at the notion of a Japanese attack. This gargantuan piece of wretched excess was Spielberg's grand blunder, a director's ego and complete creative control ('creative control' are two words at such odds to what's on screen) that turned a production into a nightmare and doesn't show the slightest sign of discipline. The result is a fantastic mess, that, so help me, I found funny. It's a shapeless film, with characters so broad, Spielberg can barely contain them in the frame and so relentless and aggressive in its destructive zany comedy, that you'll have either submitted to these shenanigans or have a giant question mark stamped onto your face while watching. Looney Tunes creator Chuck Jones was an uncredited creative assistant and seeing how this is basically a live action madcap cartoon, his influence is not surprising and he also was put in charge of a runaway torpedo sequence, that was never filmed. Belushi's character feels like a weird afterthought and forced into this cluttered series of episodic events. While the ice cold reception 1941 received was a sobering experience for the director, its go for broke mayhem style of filmmaking is a real sight to behold. The visuals are fantastic, including some of the best model work, which helped add a troubling amount of shooting days and expense to an already expensive film - and the choreography of numerous scenes involving large crowds are technical marvels. Ambition and ego collide to make one of the great missteps in film history and the result is a glorious mess.",6,0,1,5 July 2014
Gone Girl," The unreliable narrator
","This lurid tale told from an unreliable narrator, has a solid 'did he? didn't he' hook - a man's wife goes missing and he becomes the target of public scrutiny when he becomes the prime suspect. Fincher classes up this trashy story and it's both a strength and a weakness, as he wisely never lets this become over the top sordid garbage, but also never allows this to be as fun when it wallows in its sleazy storytelling. Even still, the story is so emotionally cold and misanthropic, that there's fun aplenty from how twisted and mean Gone Girl becomes. Ben Affleck does good work, under playing his role, while convincingly carrying the weight of the stress of his bizarre situation. Tyler Perry's dialogue delivery as a high priced lawyer is sharp and witty and pulled off with his stunt casting. Rosamund Pike plays our Gone Girl who you will most likely not forget for quite some time. Gone Girl is a clever film, with an ending that falls a little too easily into place, but it's always entertaining and definitely worth recommending.",7,5,13,17 December 2014
22 Jump Street," Fun enough disposable entertainment
","Like its predecessor, 22 Jump Street is a lightweight and instantly forgettable film that manages to get enough chuckles throughout. This very self aware sequel is less than slapdash in its plotting, it's barely a functional narrative. It's mostly episodic situations that our two leads find themselves in when these two undercover buffoons go to college. This meta cash grab of a sequel is definitely lazy in the filmmaking department, but the picture is held up and watchable from the chemistry of Hill and Tatum. Tatum is especially committed to this ridiculous material and he actually has a great knack for comedy. 22 Jump Street is mindless, the plot is always secondary to the jokes and it lands just enough laughs to be worth killing some time watching it.",5,0,2,30 December 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," (Insert any antonym for Amazing) Spider-Man 2
","This starts off with an embarrassing cartoon baddie played by a grunting Paul Giamatti, then has Spidey swing like an arrogant little bastard to his high school (he's a teen?) graduation, where he makes out with Gwen like a rock star. It's either bad writing, or bi-polar, but he depressingly tells her he can't be with her a scene later. Andrew Garfield plays things a bit too hyper and smug, when he's going for charming, but the boy does a fantastic American accent. We are then introduced to a mumbling and campy Jamie Foxx, who feels like he wondered off a Joel Schumacher superhero film set - and there's even an evil German scientist hamming it up with Foxx. This cluttered mess then throws Harry Osborn into the mix and some poor writing tells us he and Peter were friends as kids and not a frame of these two feels authentic. Harry needing Spidey's blood to survive and the strain it puts on Peter, doesn't earn any emotion and feels artificial, like everything else in this film. We are also spoon fed revelations about Peter's father, which are just one giant contrivance. The whole film has a connect the dots feel, with plot points that never feel developed, just forced into a screenplay that feels like studio executive notes not an actual piece of writing. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is an empty piece of committee filmmaking with no vision behind the camera. In this day and age of these types of films being pre- visualized with animation in their entirety before a frame is shot, Amazing Spider-Man 2 resembles coloring book filmmaking, all designed and pre-packaged with no artistic flair or soul. Even the music score is dreadful.",3,2,18,29 July 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," A good start to a property that has the entire galaxy to explore
","James Gunn was about the last person I'd expect to helm a Marvel film. His gory comedy Slither and the barely noticed Super were vulgar and anarchic pieces of anti-good taste and Slither is entirely successful all the more for it. For the first hour of Guardians of the Galaxy, it seemed like Gunn broke through the impenetrable micro managing force that is Marvel Studios. His directing voice is present, some of his goofy trademarks are there, some of his usual roster of actors show up and it remarkably doesn't feel like a piece of committee filmmaking. The vfx sequences seemed designed with a vision and as we are introduced to new worlds and characters it's a blast to watch a film where you're never sure where it goes or who or what you will meet along the way. Our group of odd balls, led by Chris Pratt are all cast well and even more amazingly Rocket and Groot don't feel like characters designed to sell toys. So it's a damn shame the last hour or so, the narrative stops dead in its tracks and treads water - serving us been there, done that action, character growth that feels forced and too much focus on a lame villain. Guardians feels like a third of the screenplay was thrown out and was replaced by an extended action sequence - the film was gaining momentum, pushing the story and the characters into crazed set pieces, when Gunn's voice disappears into something so formulaic, the wonder and excitement of the worlds that were created here become just another film that doesn't take any chances. I hope the success of the film awards Gunn the opportunity to have a more complete sequel and get some of his other projects off the ground.",5,3,8,17 November 2014
The Imitation Game," The story of Alan Turing is truly spectacular
","The story of Alan Turing is such a spectacular one, that even an unspectacular film like the Imitation Game is nothing short of compelling. The period detail is convincing and tech aspects of the film are top notch - all very well done by director Morten Tyldum, making his first English language film. There are some dramatic liberties of course, most of which work fine on screen - a major exception being a scene involving a member of Turing's team dramatically pleading for his brother's life on-board a naval vessel. Cumberbatch does a decent enough job as Turing and while he is committed to the role, when the man is stressed - Cumberbatch does some phony tics and speech mannerisms that come across as acting with a capital A. Knightley and Goode make the most of their roles and Dance does what he can with his one note and mostly antagonist role. The film can detour into drivel occasionally, especially when Turing's colleagues threaten to quit over his dismissal - but more often than not, The Imitation Game is serviceable entertainment and does enough justice to a great story and a great man.",6,0,3,29 December 2014
Black Hawk Down," Jingoistic, kind of racist, but spectacularly well made
","Ridley Scott delivers a blunt force patriotic American film that is so jingoistic that some scenes seem one step shy of having 1-800-GO-ARMY appear on the screen. It's an unabashedly American film that shows delight in filming the American flag, as well as mowing down as many 'skinnies' as possible. There is a scene when an American soldier is wounded next to the downed black hawk and after he is killed by a rampaging mob of Somalis, they tear off his clothes and parade him around. That is not the offensive part, it's how Scott films them - close ups of grunting Somalis that seems like he's filming animals. In fact there is very little humanity on display in Black Hawk Down, the American soldiers are all cardboard cutout noble and most of the cast is indistinguishable from one another, with the exception of easily recognizing Ewan McGregor and Ewen Bremner because of their poor American accents. When I saw this film in theaters in 2001, I detested it, as it felt like a piece of violent propaganda. Years later, I revisited the film and while it still suffers from those issues that bothered me on first viewing, I was able to appreciate just how damn well made the film is. The cinematography is masterful and the action is staged almost perfectly. On a technical level Ridley Scott did deserve his Best Director nomination and the film is worth viewing for the sheer level of craft on display.",6,0,1,27 May 2014
Elysium," Blomkamp fumbles his first studio project
","After Neill Blomkamp's out of nowhere success with District 9, he gets a sizable budget increase and what feels like his financiers chipping away at his script, until there is no vision behind the final product, just a generic and accessible film. If you remove a couple of quick shots of blood and gore and a few bits of profanity, this would play out entirely the same and still feel like it's basically derivative kids stuff. The premise is intriguing, but the good ends there, as this is just a by the numbers bit of storytelling about the haves and haves not -- the rich who live in a giant habitat in space away from the hellish conditions on earth. Exploring this wonderful idea quickly gives way to silly action scenes, one dimensional characters and a waste of expensive vfx rendering the interesting Elysium. We never really see what life on Elysium is really like, just a few wide shots of a few people in a pool or a fancy gathering - it basically looks like a fancy resort and seems really boring. Our brief time on Elysium is spent with an awful character played by Jodie Foster who gives a crummy performance sporting an ear screeching accent. Another undeveloped subplot about Foster's character forming a pact with an underused William Fichtner to re-code Elysium so that she will be president just becomes a throwaway plot point that lazily gives Damon's character a reason to get to Elysium. It's this part of the film that ends up resembling Johnny Mnemonic, with Damon carrying important data in his head that everyone wants and cyberpunk visuals that feel like this is pillaging from other already derivative films. Sharlto Copley and his henchmen play pure evil characters, who aren't the the least bit interesting to watch and a standard take the girl and her daughter who is important to the main character hostage is even more forced and tired. Elysium is a film that presents grand ideas in the guise of a silly sci-fi actioner and has a narrative so full of holes and wasted potential, that it collapses under the weight of its own shoddy storytelling. As hard on the film as I sound, it's still watchable, it's just a step backwards for Blomkamp who didn't seem to navigate the minefield of studio filmmaking well at all.",5,0,1,24 August 2014
In Time," I smell a metaphor
","Class struggle is broken down into a simplistic metaphor that wouldn't tax the smarts of a 5 year old and just in case you missed the blunt force allegory you have plenty of visuals to remind you, such as a countdown clock on everyone's arm and time zones dividing the rich from the poor. Director Andrew Niccol takes an idea that isn't clever and is just high concept and wraps it up in a generic plot about taking down the system. Justin Timberlake who has already proved himself a more than competent actor, barely registers a pulse as our thinly written lead and Amanda Seyfried looks bored and annoyed to be apart of the production. For a society that doesn't age over 25, Cillian Murphy looks suspiciously 10 years older and Timberlake can barely pass as someone in their 20s. In Time does offer some very good unintended comedy, especially at the expense of Olivia Wilde's character running out of time and Timberlake being inexplicably blamed for killing and stealing the rich man's time who personally gave Timberlake his time, even though there's surveillance everywhere. This is a spectacularly stupid picture that entertains from collapsing under the weight of it's own clumsy premise. It's made by people who all should have known better and somehow even managed to attract cinematographer Roger Deakins who used In Time as his first foray into digital cinematography.",2,2,4,21 June 2014
12 Years a Slave," A great film without a false note
","I went into 12 Years A Slave with a lot of reluctance after immensely disliking director Steve McQueen's previous two films, especially Shame which I found reached hysterical heights of such inane drama that I shuttered at the thought of him tackling this subject matter. From the opening until the very last shot, McQueen has a masterful command of his craft and his film doesn't have a false note - he made a great picture. Chiwetel Ejiofor does fine work as an educated man from New York who gets kidnapped and sent down south to be sold into slavery. What he endures over the next 12 years is a degrading nightmare that makes your blood boil at such wretched humanity. Fassbender is a particular standout amongst a strong cast, as a grotesque slave owner who brings many layers to this villainous role that easily could have fallen into a one note archetype in a lesser actor's hands. Pitt shows up in a small role that doesn't require much from him and in what could have been a throwaway day player role, Giamatte makes the most of his slimy character. McQueen never over sells the drama and while scenes show humanity at its worst and most cruel, the film is surprisingly not grueling to sit through. One of the best films of 2013 for sure.",9,0,1,9 September 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Very well done
","This is a welcome return to big budget form for Doug Liman after stumbling with the mess that was Jumper. This high concept screenplay is explored to its fullest potential and perhaps its greatest achievement is its sense of humor throughout. It's basically light gallows humor, watching Cruise die over and over again.The film is very well made and it's a welcome change of pace to see a vfx film shot on 35mm giving some grain and texture to the effects. In an era of filmmaking where most effects sequences are pre- visualized to an almost sterilizing degree, the action filmed feels remarkably spontaneous - thanks to Liman's chaotic, figure it out on set style of filmmaking, that has been aptly named 'Limania.'As Cruise gets caught in this time loop where he repeats the same day over and over, the script fleshes this scenario out where it never feels repetitive or predictable. A concept like this is prime for writing itself into a corner and forcing a last act to resolve everything, but Edge of Tomorrow avoids such last act problems. A minor gripe with the script would be that no one recognizes Cage as an officer, yet he is a prominent media figure that got millions of recruits to join the fight. That aside, Edge of Tomorrow is a hell of a lot of fun.",8,7,9,23 September 2014
Defiance," Great story, not so great characterizations
","A fantastic true story is given a Hollywood treatment and cardboard cutout characters with questionable accents by the actors make this an unsatisfying film. It's difficult to get emotionally invested in archetypal characters spouting generic dialogue and these one dimensional people never make the stakes feel high enough to care about their fate. Edward Zwick who usually has a strong visual style, flatly directs this picture which looks more suited for television than on the big screen. His screenplay feels like the cliff notes version of Defiance: The Bielski Partisans, punched up with stereotypical hero speak, stereotypical jerk characters whose fate is sealed the moment they act like a jerk and action sequences that feel designed to get the film funded and belong in another film. Watching this group of survivors squabble and deal with the deadly elements of winter is usually undermined by poor acting and atrocious dialogue - never helped by off screen shouts of some variation of 'it's dangerous' 'we have no food!' 'we can't make it across that river.' Defiance wastes a spectacular true story and is a generic, by the numbers film.",5,0,1,27 November 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Great acting, technically accomplished and lots of jet black humor
","A washed up big screen actor mounts a Broadway show as a comeback vehicle and with this loon in charge of production, things go hilariously off the wall. Keaton does fantastic work here as a man desperately clinging to the need to be relevant again and is tortured and occasionally guided by the voice and powers of Birdman. As opening night gets closer, the stress sends Riggan into a tailspin of unhinged behavior - his play might be an embarrassment, an actor keeps sabotaging previews by getting drunk and trashing the set or having an erection on stage, his daughter fresh out of rehab hates his guts, his kind of girlfriend might be pregnant, he's burning through all of his cash on this play and the most powerful critic wants to kill his play on the principle of who he is. It's not easy being a self absorbed lunatic, who once played an iconic superhero. Occasionally Birdman can meander and by the film's conclusion, every actor has their scene to emote and while a few of those can feel a little episodic, there's always enough humor and wit to overcome any bumps along the way. Norton in particular is a standout who is hilarious as a difficult actor. Designed to be one long unbroken shot, occasionally it feels like a gimmick, but more often than not, the cinematography feels invisible. Most of the camera work feels spontaneous and the focus pulling is as accomplished as the seamless edits. Birdman is an odd and original work with some jet black humor throughout and a fully committed cast makes this always fascinating to watch.",7,2,11,10 November 2014
Lucy," No brain function was used during the writing and making of this film
","What will happen when Luc Besson uses none of his brain while making Lucy? A film with the philosophical insight of a stoned 14 year old boy and is so jaw droppingly stupid, it's frightening to imagine a major theatrical release that's worse than Lucy in 2014. Metaphors are literally shown to the audience with footage of animals, like a mouse being enticed by bate in a mouse trap and it's either Luc Besson's idea of artistic flair or he thinks so little of his audience that he has to spell out even the dumbest scene. Morgan Freeman's speeches about using more than 10% percent of the human brain, even in fantasy movie land, are so simplistic and silly, an audience of children would be more fitting than college students and adults. For someone that has apparently unlocked all of her brain, Lucy doesn't use much of it and has gotten herself drawn into a really terrible action movie - when she could have used her smarts and about 5 minutes to synthesize the drug for herself, or simply duplicate it with her powers. But no, she has to travel the globe to get a few bags from some mules, because the worldwide theatrical box office would benefit from it, not that a modicum of logic should dictate the story. Idiot plotting; dialogue that's equal parts point at the screen hilarious and roll your eyes into the back of your head bad; villains who are typical stock characters that you'd find in your standard straight to video actioner; a climax that was either cut due to budget restraints or Besson just had no ideas outside of throwing his percentage of brain gimmick into the structure of a D grade action film - Lucy is truly out of this world dim-witted.",2,10,24,5 November 2014
The Purge," Standard home invasion movie with a gimmick
","The plot of all crime is legal for 12 hours once a year, so America gets its violence out of its system is a fantastic gimmick that is at once subversive and darkly comic. Unfortunately this is a low budget cheapie that ignores its own premise and turns into a standard home invasion flick that falls victim to the standard tropes associated with these types of films. It tosses out any wit for one dimensional characters making fatally stupid decisions that makes you want to reach through the screen to slap them repeatedly. The only real element of the premise that survives is a ticking clock gimmick, so our dimwit main characters just need to survive for X amount of more time. The Purge is a frustrating film that doesn't deliver and wastes an interesting idea.",4,0,0,16 July 2014
Godzilla," Well made, but doesn't deliver
","While a good portion of the first act teases with glimpses of the big 'ol fella, after his unveil it continues to tease by cutting away to uninteresting story lines and ultimately becomes a frustrating experience. One dimensional and incredibly bland human characters do nothing to hold our attention, while we impatiently wait for some oversized well rendered pixels to level cities and fight each other. There are some exciting, well directed set pieces, but they feel like bookends to some truly atrocious human drama. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is so vanilla as a lead and has such little screen presence, that if they digitally erased him from every scene, I probably wouldn't even notice. Elizabeth Olsen feels tacked on last minute into this narrative and she has nothing to work with and Bryan Cranston mugs for the camera. But quality human drama is not why you watch a Godzilla film, but that's really all that's served here - minus the quality.",5,3,7,25 August 2014
Valkyrie," The Tom Cruise eye patch movie
","This film was ridiculed throughout its production, from the casting and lack of German accents to Cruise's eye patch - Valkyrie was to be the quick death of the rebooted MGM. A big budget disaster, that would destroy even more what Lions for Lambs did to MGM. Pulling in $200m worldwide, the film was successful enough in the box office and wasn't the critical disaster that many expected (or hoped for), though it hardly received love from critics. The film is a tight old fashioned thriller, with strong direction from Bryan Singer and a nice pulpy, no fat screenplay that doesn't waste a moment on the plot to kill Hitler. It's a quick history lesson with the framework of a thriller. So while the film is all surface and doesn't go deep, that's hardly a criticism and there's much to recommend here. Cruise is adequate, but it's the machinations of the plan that when put in action are nothing short of entertaining to watch - even though you know how it will end.",7,0,0,11 May 2014
The Island," Clones on the run
","This box office bomb lowered troubled DreamWorks selling price over a hundred million dollars and stalled a deal with Universal, before being bought out by Paramount. Considering the amount of product placement in The Island, the film should have practically been paid for. In fact, the whole film visually resembles a commercial. No matter how much Bay blames the actors for not being a big enough draw or the marketing failing, The Island's failures rest on his shoulders. The premise is an interesting one, about clones being harvested for their human counterparts. But the film is not really interested in that idea, it just uses that as a springboard for two clones on the run, who end up in a dumb action film. You might ask, why even bother to animate the clones and give them consciousness and identities if they are going to the butcher shop soon anyway - but the film tosses in a quick throwaway line to address that illogical premise. The organs failed without the human experience or human connections - top notch writing. Once on the run, our two uninteresting clones end up in a series of expensive chases, with lots of property damage, and are sought after by the super serious Djimon Hounsou - who's lines usually consist of 'do not let them get away, do not let them get away!' I'm sure his henchmen needed the extra reminder not to let them get away. The Island is a soulless product that is overlong and the quickly edited action is repetitive and boring.",4,0,3,9 June 2014
