The Blair Witch Project," More than just marketing
","We know how this movie came to theaters: with (maybe) the best marketing campaign of all time. An internet website, the directors listing the actors as missing, create a local legend... that's some of the tactics used to make viewers think that this movie was real. Because that, some people thought that what they saw on Blair Witch was real (sorry, I love the marketing for this, but that's not really intelligent). And that's also thanks to the found footage technique they implemented to make the film. This type of filmmaking wasn't really new, we have films like Cannibal Holocaust, Guinea Pig, The Last Broadcast...and though some of them made some noise, Blair Witch was the one that, for better or for worse, popularized the 'sub-genre'.
Now, what is Blair Witch about? Is about three not-so-likable student filmmakers that go on to woods to make a documentary about a legend know as the Blair Witch. And that, is the perfect setting for a movie of this type. With a budget so low, what we get is just scenes of mad people lost in the forest, trying to get out of there. And because of that, the movie has some pacing issues, and audiences that like to consume the McDonald's equivalent of horror movies, will hate this.
Our three main guys do a excelent job conducting the story, more if you consider some of the reactions are real or are improv. The way the movies was made, with the actors throwed in the woods with some provisions and directions of what to do and filmed, is very clever, the night scenes are amazing because of that, the actors were actually frightened, and you can tell that. And that ending, is very powerful, it's one of my favorites from any horror film.
Yes, Blair Witch is an example of how you shold promote your film, but if you actually look at the film, you will realize this is a masterful take on the mockumentary genre. Recommended for anyone that has pacience and can appreciate a slow burn.",9,2,4,14 August 2019
Despicable Me 2," Boring follow up
","Some funny parts here and there, but laughting four times in an hour and a half movie, that's a letdown. Most of the jokes are just plain stupid, maybe the worst comedy out of the three Despicable Me movies
Yeah, I know this is a children movie, but the history is extremely boring, that even my little brothers were uninterested watching this.
For me, this is the weakest in the franchise, not even recommended for kids.",4,1,2,19 July 2019
Insidious: Chapter 2," Hilariously bad!
","It surprised me that Wan actually directed this sequel, because that's not an usual thing for the guy. For that, I expected this to be at least at the level of the original, that it was bad, but watchable.
My expecteitions were wrong.
The story is so nonsensical, that is actually funny.
But you know, the best aspect of this is not the cinematography like in the first one, it's actually Patrick Wilson. He's so over the top as this poor man's version of Jack Nicholson in The Shining that is a blast watching it, it's comedy gold.
So yeah, don't watch this.",2,1,2,11 July 2019
The Hangover," Not as funny as I remembered
","Back in the day, I loved this movie. I tough it was fantastic and that it was an original comedy film. I decided to revisit the whole trilogy, and oh man what a surprise this is not good.
This was praised as being original, I though that too. It's not, I mean this is like a rip-off of a Simpsons episode. And the core idea of the film it's totally wasted. They could've made a masterpiece, but this movie lacks precision and the pace is too slow.
Yes, there are some funny things, I will not deny that. Zach Galifiandandonga does a great job in his role, Bradley Cooper is good too. For me the best one here is Ken Jeong, that man was born to play Mr. Chow.
Meh, this is just meh. Watch this with some drunk friends, that's the only way you will trully enjoy this.",5,0,2,30 July 2019
It," Another clown, another failure
","Let's get this clear, both this new adaptation and the 90's miniseries suck, sorry but that the truth.
Now, why this movie didn't live up to my not-even-high expectations? Well...
First of all, the casting. We all love Tim Curry, his portray of It is amazing, truly memorable and funny. While he's obviously not scary, it's a blast everytime he appeared on screen in that old movie. Here, Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd tries to fill the shoes of Curry, in a not so successful way. Why's that? Because he makes you laugh. This is not like the miniseries, so why go for another not-threatining clown? Don't get me wrong, I love SkarsgÃ¥rd as Pennywise, but his performance doesn't fit with the tone of the movie at all. But the biggest letdown were the kids. Only the girl does a great job, everyone else are just whatever (except the stranger things kid, he's really bad here). No one but Bev has any development, they're just token characters: the fatty one, the black one, the jewish one...they had time to do 1000 jumpscares but no time for writing actual characters.
Every modern Hollywood 'horror movie' has to rely on jumpscares for scaring the audiences, but in It they took it to a new level. Like the Conjuring movies, every scene starts and ends the same way: a character walks in some place, we get some 'silence', the cue for the scare comes, and then the monster appears doing a loud scream. That's every attemp to scare you, i'm not joking.
While I get that the movie has a 'low budget' of 35 million, I can't understand why every creature looks like s*it. Remember how goofy the giant spider at the end of the miniseries looked? Here is the same, but for every monster except the clown. Instead of being bored, I was having a blast everytime they appeared, no joking even a claymation youtube video has better effects than this crap. Loved the desing for Pennywise anyways, no hate for that one.
And my biggest complaint is the music. Both the OST and the soundtrack suck af. I can't believe the music irritated me even more than the jumpscares. There's not a single second of actual silence, or you're listening a trashy generic horror score, or you're listening cheesy 80's pop songs. Seriously that's the laziest aspect of this mess.
It (the book) is a mature and kinda fcked up history about kids for adults, here...pfff, this is like the Goonies with 2 gory scenes.",4,2,3,8 September 2019
Coraline," Captivatingly creative
","Visual masterpiece, that delivers a relatable history of childish inconformitity with a touch of oniric creepyness.",10,0,1,10 July 2019
Cloverfield," A fun ride through NY
","Yes, this is a fun found footage-monster invasion film. Unfortunately, is just that, fun.
While I totally understand why people we're so hyped about this movie back in 2008 and why they ended it loving it (myself included but years after it's release), now that I rewatched it, I have to say that it has a lot of problems.
The main complaint that everyone has while watching a found footage is 'why the hell this guy keeps filming this? Drop the camera and run dude!', and yes it applies for Cloverfield too. The character behind the camera has no real reason to keep filming, in some instances it's extremely ridiculous that the guy is still recording. And talking about that guy...the writter couldn't write him to be even more hateful? The guy is annoying at the point that you ask yourself if he has mental problems or something, even his so called bests friends can't stand him.
Now that I mention his friends, they're not that great either. The motivation of our main character is as thin as a piece of paper, even if I was in that situation I would not risk my life or the life of my brother and friends just to try to save my ex, I mean he really loved her because even when his brother dies he shows zero emotion. I blame that the characters are not so likable more on the part of the scrip that on the acting (except for you camera guy).
But if we ignore those aspects a little bit while watching the movie you have a very enjoyable monster feature. The design of the creature is very original and creative, they did an amazing job at giving America a monster that is not King Kong. The action scenes keep you interesting on what's going on, and cosidering that the movie is so short, you find yourself glued at the scream until the movie finishes.
So yeah, don't think too much about it or the magic will be loss in the way. A high 6/10 for this one.",6,0,0,24 August 2019
Megamind," A forgotten gem
","Though Megamind may not be that original, the visuals and the voice cast turn it into something great. It has a level of rewatchability few animated movies have, and that's because it makes the most out of it's concept, throwing really funny jokes throught that'll make even adults laugh. Unfortunately the movie drags a little bit in some instances, making it tedious in some parts.
Wasn't really a hit back in the day, so I hope more people have seen it since it was released. Overall, I give this a strong 7, and I truly recommend it.",7,0,0,14 September 2019
The Conjuring 2," More is not always better
","If the first Conjuring was a simple old-school kind of horror movie that resulted in a breath of fresh air, this second part is the opposite.
This tries to be everything the first wasn't:
If the first one didn't rely that much on jumpscares to scare you, but rather in building tension, this one has to have a loud noise every minute.
If the first one was a simple story of a house with a demon, that reached a not so dumb satisfaying climax near the end, this one has to be this grandiosity were people fly and have superpowers and can see the future and blah blah blah.
If the first one had great acting from all (except the family father), in this one the child actors have to suck.
If the first one didn't have an overlong runtime, this has to be over two hoursand twenty minutes.
You get why i'm trying to say? This movie has this aspiration to be grandiose, but it doesn't need to.
I have to recognize the film is not that bad, it has some great aspects like the cinematography, but it doesn't reach the level of the original. You can skip it, or you can watch it, but don't expect anything really good.",5,0,5,25 July 2019
Yesterday," Money (That's What Danny-Boy Wants)
","Not even the Beatles music could save this garbage. 'Yesterday' is about a mediocre musician that, after an accident, is the only person that remembers the Beatles. Why's that? We don't receive any explanation. The film, instead of focusing on the cultural impact on such an event, decides to be another awful romantic comedy.
Our main character is a whiny little biatch, that complaints about not being recognized for his 'talent', and that only rise to success after stealing the Beatles songs. Let's face something, if the Beatles were formed today...no one would pay attention, that's the sad truth, because everyone is a normie that only listens to trap or reggaeton or garbage like that. And people would care less if the Beatles were only Himesh Patel (ugh). This man is the most uncarismatic person ever, my toe has more personality than him. All the music of the Beatles is butchered, literally the man can't sing, and the arrangements for the songs are atrocious or mediocre.
But the biggest problem of the movie is a woman called Lily James. Her character is the worst person ever put on screen. I can't describe how horrible she is, you have to watch the movie, all i'm going to say is that she's basically the antagonist. Lily James>Hitler, yes she's more evil, that's all.
At the end of the day, what Yesterday teaches us is that:
a) If you have talent for something, you're a bad person that should only live in mediocrity.
b) If you have a dream, forget about it, because you should not be successful.
c) You can't have ambition, because you would be greedy.
d) A crazy woman should control your life.
e) Ed Sheeran needed promotion for his music.
f) Danny Boyle has lost its touch.",2,1,6,16 September 2019
Get Out," A movie with the depth of a Tales from the Crypt episode
","Despite my rating, I don't hate this film. I find it to be an unspecial movie that doesn't know if it's a horror or comedy one. Surprisingly Jordan Peele has some film knowledge, and it shows a couple of times in the film, for example the opening or the hypnosis scenes. Overall this movie is decent on a technical aspect, but what ruins it is the script.
Full with plot holes and clichés and nonsense, the movie is just stupid. It tries to be more than what it is introducing social and political commentary. First of all, i'm not american, i'm mexican. And second, I don't care about what happens in the USA. For me, a movie that says that racism is bad and white people are bad, will not have an impact on me. I don't hate white people like a lot of americans, i'm not a SJW, and I don't sympatize with black people (because they are the most racist towards latin americans, believe or not). So, the fact that this movie has this message, doesn't make it good. Letting this aside, we just have another generic horror movie, with stupid jumpscares and stupid characters and bad acting (except Daniel Kaluuya, he does a good job) and a stupid script (we know why this won an Oscar, because is a movie made by black people).
If you genuiney like this film, that's ok, good for you. But please, don't go around hating and calling people racist because they don't agree with you.",3,15,23,25 July 2019
Insidious," Another generic horror movie
","Booo! A badly make up demon wants to posses your child!
You know James Wan, we know this movie since the '70s.At least in going to give props to the guy, he knows how to handle a camera. The technical aspects are quite good. But the story...",4,0,0,11 July 2019
From Dusk Till Dawn," Love THE twist
","Sometimes I wonder how good FDtD would've been if it was a 100% serious film...maybe not that great if i'm being honest, that's why I don't mind when the odd thriller transforms into a cheesy vampire b-movie.
Some people hate the 2nd half, personally I really love it for how humorous it is, but I know that it's also totally out of place.
Anyway, any movie where Quentin Tarantino atrocious acting actually works is a plus for me.P.S.: That dance scene is the only good thing Salma Hayek has ever done.",8,0,1,26 October 2019
Jurassic World," DO YOU REMEMBER JURASSIC PARK!!!???
","Jurassic Park is a movie classic. Period. Yes, the sequels were never even close to the level, but at least they were entertaining. We can't say the same about Jurassic World.
It's obvious that this is just a cash-grab aimed at nostalgic fans. Forget about the interesting characters, incredible effects, and compelling story of the original... surprise, this is the opposite.
We couldn't care less about our protagonists, they're poorly written and mediocre performances don't help.
The script is so stupid that it's funny what happens on screen, at least you can laugh about it.
The effects are uninteresting, they don't help the action scenes at all, they're really tedious.
Really bad sequel, just go and see the originalOh, I almost forget about the high heels...that's comedy gold.",3,0,2,9 July 2019
The Hangover Part II," A carbon copy of the original, but funnier
","This is exactly the first hangover movie, the only change is that we're now in Thailand. And some people dislike this film because of that.
But in my opinion is just funnier. Yeah, most of the jokes are the same, but are taken to a level of absurdity that I really dig. We get more Mr. Chow here, and he's obviously the best part of the movie.
My biggest complain has to be that the movie just looks so ugly. Is very painful to watch this, the color palette is atrocious.
Give this a 4 for being a total copy, but personally is a 5. Slightly recomended(?).",4,1,2,30 July 2019
Sinister," How to ruin your movie
","Sinister starts out promising, the first scene is actually great, is a scene I actually remember after more than a year I watched this movie. And the firts half of the movie is quite decent. Ethan Hawke is great, playing a very rare type of lead character for a horror film. The cinematography is good, I like the stationary feel of the camera in most of the movie, and most of the Super 8 segments are creepy, the first one being the best. The score is quite decent, it is very subtle and it fits well.
But then the stupid looking demon appears. Jumpscares and boredom and nonsense take over, and you just don't care, because you know the director panicked out of fear that his project wouldn't sell because it was different or the producers turned this into mediocrity.
What a waste of potential.",4,1,2,22 July 2019
Reservoir Dogs," And this is how everything started...
","Easyly one of the best debuts of all time.
Everything is perfectly crafted, from the cinematography, to the script and dialogue, to the acting.
All you know about Tarantino movies is right here. This went down in history as one of the most important independent films ever released, and it totally shows why.
Reservoir Dogs is the proof that if you actually have a vision and if you put pasion in your what you're doing you will succed.
Being a master right from the beginning is something few directors can say about themselves. For me, at least in my top 50. A must watch for everyone.",10,0,0,12 July 2019
Don't Breathe," Daredevil vs stupid thieves
","Three uncharismatic thieves break into the house of a blind old man after they discover he's got a fortune as a compensation for the murder of his daughter; but little they knew that the blind old man is an older and superpowered evil version of Daredevil (the man has superstrenght, can teleport, is a gun expert, is unkillable...).
If you let this nonsense (and an incredible amount of other script problems) you'll find in Don't Breathe a short, well crafted, suspenseful horror thriller with an amazing performance by Stephen Lang as the blind man that will give you some chills.",6,1,1,15 October 2019
Sausage Party," Well done guys, you've outdone yourselves
","If you have an actual decent idea and you're trying to communicate a good message with it, please don't be Seth Rogen or Evan Goldberg.
We all know these guys, they're the guys behind all those raunchy comedies you may have enjoyed when you were like 12 years old. Unfortunately for them, we all grow up, and we become more mature with age, and all those movies they've put out will be embarrassing for you to watch because of how obscene and stupid and juvenile they actually were. But with Sausage Party, I just can't comprehend how something like this could have been made.
Sausage Party has to be the worst thing these guys ever released. With more swears than an Eminem song and the most unfunny, juvenile, obvious jokes ever, this thing is just gross and disgusting.
I can say that humor is one of the few things I could consider subjective, but boy, you have to be like a 10 year old or an American bro-dude to enjoy this crap.
I give this a 2 because of the concept (that itself is not bad), the message, and that Saving Private Ryan scene. Other than that, this movie is pure garbage.",2,0,3,26 August 2019
The Secret Life of Pets," Toy Story...i mean 'Pet Story'?
","Let's put aside the fact that this is actually a remake of Toy Story with bits of Toy Story 2. Unlike those, this movie is extremely boring and uninteresting. The first 3 minutes are fun, and that's it.
The animation is ok, but the character models are some of the worst I have seen in an animated movie. They're gross looking. I mean, they gave them b**th0les, for god's saked.
The characters don't have any motivation, they just do things because...I guess they have to. The 'ex-pets' stuff in the sewer is so bad. Kevin Hart as this evil bunny comes irritating, he just screams non-sense the whole time.
I guess children might be entertaining, but if you're an adult, I don't think you will enjoy this at all.",3,0,3,12 July 2019
The Conjuring," Horror done right
","The Conjuring has all the clichÃ©s you would expect from a modern horror movie, but surprisingly, is not atrocious.
This movie works because the history is not that dumb. The script plays it safe, hitting all the beats from an average hounted house film, but without the stupidity those movies come with.
The actors do a great job, none of them suck, Patrick Wilson being the standout for me. Maybe the child actors are weak in moments, but never in a really low level.
The cinematography is beautiful, as usual in James Wan movies. There are some very memorable shots here.
The blend of old school and modern horror really is interesting, there are not many jumpscares. Thank god.
I would go and say this may be the best James Wan movie (yes, better than Saw) and one of the most decent horror flicks in recent memory. Very recomended.",7,1,2,24 July 2019
Despicable Me," The only decent Illumination flick
","Illumination is infamous for making the most uninspired and mediocre animation movies of this time. But at least, their first try, wasn't really bad.
Despicable Me is a mildly fun, innofensive, well animated kids movie.
Some bits are boring, maybe five minutes less could help.
The minions are not as annoying as they would be in the future, yet they are undoubtedly the worst part of the movie.
Steve Carell does a good job, his character is entertaining, and his arc, though a little forced, is convincing.
Quite watchable, but you can find much better animation movies to see.",6,0,1,19 July 2019
Iron Man," An amazing start for a not so amazing universe
","In a personal quest of giving the MCU a second chance to prove me that is not as awful as I think it is, I will rewatch every movie up to Endgame, so we have to start with Iron Man. And yeah this is exactly what I remembered it was: a fun superhero movie that actually knows what to do.
With Iron Man, Marvel found a formula that worked, and that unfortunately they have squeeze for 10 years that every 'origin' movie they make is just a remake of Iron Man. And I get why they do this. Iron Man works because it plays safe. We get a simple history, the typical hero's journey, ad what better if the hero we're talking about is Iron Man. Who knew who Iron Man was back in 2008? Just comic book readers like me, if you asked people if they knew Iron Man, they would've probably ask if you we're talking about the Black Sabbath song. Robert Downey Jr., a faded star that had some very serious addiction problems (ironically, just like the character itself), was gifted to play Iron Man. The man was born to play Tony Stark, yeah he's a great actor, but if you think about him, this role will pop in your mind instantly. He does a wondeful job at playing the childish CEO that eventually transforms in the hero.
But enough praise for Downey Jr., there are other things to talk about. The rest of the casting does a great job, except for one color dude no one remembers. An unrecognizable Jeff Bridges is the villain, and while the character itself is weak and we don't get so much explanation at why he's bad, Bridges still does a good job. Gwyneth Paltrow was also perfect casted as Pepper, she is in every Iron Man film a great support character, and her relationship with Tony Stark here is charming.
Why everyone went to the cinema when this was released was part thankful to that red and yellow suit. I have to say that the CGI of this film back in the day was impresive, but it hasn't aged that well, especially at the fight at the end with the villain. Still, is not annoying or anything like that, but is quite distracting.
So yeah, I have to say that Iron Man, while flawed, was a perfect start for the MCU, that after this one, has released more than 20 movies, few of them reach the quality of this first instalment, but all that succes is thanks to a playboy we all love.",7,2,4,26 August 2019
The Purge," Possibly, the stupidest movie of all time.
","You know the infinite monkey theorem? If you don't, it's a theorem that states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, being Hamlet the most notable example. I actually think that such thing it's entirely possible, but let's not go as far as saying they could write Hamlet, no no no, I think that this thing is true because this giant piece of s*** exists.
If you haven't watch The Purge, please don't, it's not even funny bad, it's enfuriating bad. If you have and if you're more intelligent than a monkey, then you know this thing has the most stupid premise, characters and dialogue than most of the films you have watched on your life. That's why I give this monstrosity a 0/10.P.S.: Maybe the only good thing that happened because of the release of this movie, is that my mom found a cellphone at the end of the screening... not even that made her happy after seing this thing.",1,1,2,20 October 2019
The Hangover Part III," What they were thinking?
","The change in direction is just stupid. There is no hangover here, this is a failed attempt of a thriller.
Nobody really wanted to be here, you can see it on the faces of the actors, they were just in this for money or for contractual obligation.
Laughed three or four times. Just watch the after credits scene, is the only good scene in the whole movie.",2,1,3,30 July 2019
