Black Swan," Finally, Something Original From Hollywood
","Finally, something I haven't seen before out of Hollywood! I'm so tired of bad remakes, cartoon & superhero-based movies & unnecessary sequels. BLACK SWAN was awesome and kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time wondering what happens next? Isn't that what a great movie is supposed to do? And just in a snap, two hours goes flying by and at the end, I wanted more.Natalie Portman deserved her Golden Globe. She was the perfect, sweet & demure ballerina from a lineage of ballerinas. She was convincingly the 'good girl' or White Swan. But as we see the competition closes in around her, and good girls are out and bad girls are in! Mila Kunis swoops in to steal her much deserved spotlight. But just because you deserve it and put in the hours doesn't mean you will get it in the crazy world of dancing! Natalie's character digs deep into crazy to find her inner diva, the Black Swan.I can't wait to rent this film, because I'm sure that I missed some subtle things happening in the background. There are subconscious 'easter eggs' too -- like Natalie's wardrobe goes from whites & pinks to black. You may miss it, but her skin shutters too. The story also parallels the story of Swan Lake. So you can pick out each of the main character's roles and who is playing which part.",10,2,6,19 January 2011
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," More like: 'Prince of Persia: Waste of Time!'
","'Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time' was a terrible movie -- and I am usually a fan of Disney movies and was even familiar with the Prince of Persia game franchise.It was clear early on that this movie was just a mindless action flick - and a baaaad one at that! The dialogue consisted of either cheesy one-liners, or detailed but very fast-paced plot points (Why are they attacking that beautiful, peaceful city again?!) - neither ploys generated real interest to viewers. Each scene moved right into a choppy action sequence & clunky aerobic stunts by Gyllenhaal.Jake Gyllenhaal could not hold his own as the lead role in this action movie. Could he be any less Persian-looking? Why the horrible English accent? Why so many cheesy, one-liners? His goofy face just didn't fit a serious action hero role. The fight scenes were so contrived, manipulated, edited & chopped up, that they lost any momentum or power. They also lacked continuity.I gave this movie a shot because I wanted to see what Gyllenhaal could do in this lead action role. I was disappointed and almost embarrassed for him! Certainly that Disney Standard was just not there. The only positives I could find were in the elaborate costumes, city sets & effects -- and even those seemed too contrived in some parts. Ehh. SKIP IT!",3,1,2,6 December 2010
Alice in Wonderland," I Wanted to Like This More Than I Did
","Visuals & special effects - check! Costumes - check! Musical score - check! New leading young actress - check! Tim Burton gothicness - check! So why wasn't I blown away by Alice In Wonderland? It had some dark undertones & creepiness, but I really wanted more. Something darker & more sinister, like Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth. I wanted meaner & grosser creatures, but Tim Burton can't seem to go all the way, especially when funded by Disney. So, like all his other movies, he almost makes a cool, Gothic film.I digress, but Tim Burton, like Johnny Depp & Helena Bonham Carter, can't seem to cross into greatness because of their Disney connections. Let's face it, Disney doesn't want to alienate their young fans and offend parents. But I think they would shine better if they did their own, independent thing. I'm sick of Depp doing goofy franchise roles (Pirates of the Caribbean) or cartoon voice-overs. I want to see some real acting! Kick it up a notch folks.Alice in Wonderland was good, not great. It fell short because 1) it was too long and dragged toward the end, 2) it was not creepy, dark or scary enough. It was clearly a Disney production.",6,1,2,19 January 2011
Inception," Great, Original & Stunningly Beautiful Movie
","You may not understand entirely what is going on in INCEPTION, especially on the first go- around, haha, but you will be blown away by the special effects & edge-of-your-seat, super spy plot. This movie was visually stunning and had an excellent Golden Globe nominated music score. Casting was perfect -- not too many big-named stars stepping on each other's toes (like in Oceans 11, for example. That's distracting.). This had a good mix of actors who worked together in a believable way on-screen. Inception may be too long, at least 30-45 minutes could be cut, but overall it was a great, original action flick -- action, romance, danger, spys & blowing sh*t up! Nice!",9,1,6,19 January 2011
Easy A," Overrated, Don't Understand the Hype
","Convinced by national reviewers that this movie would be a sarcastic, cute modern day teenage high school flick, against better judgment, I decided to rent EASY A. From the very beginning however, I know that something was terribly wrong. I saw no humor in Emma Stone's 'Scarlet Letter' situation. Her dialogue & sarcasm were unrealistic for someone her age, I'm sorry. And the odd relationship with her wacky parents? Unreal. Stanley Tucci was seriously miscast as the dad. He just came off as creepy. And Patricia Clarkson phoned it in as the quirky, uncensored bohemian mom. Lisa Kudrow had some small funny parts, but her love triangle with Thomas Haden Church and -- was it Amanda Bynes? I had seriously checked out by that point.There's no doubt that Emma Stone has talent, is smart, witty & adorable. She's the new Lindsay Lohan! But I thought that this movie was overkill in every way. It certainly wasn't as deep or clever as the writers thought it was. It was no Clueless or Mean Girls. I could care less about what happened to each of the characters. And that Alyson Michalka from Hell Cats needs to go -- in what world is she in high school?? She looks well over 30 years old. Ew!Easy A = Grade: D",5,5,8,19 January 2011
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Momentum Lost - Cast Coasts By On This Dull Installment
","I'm not one of those die-hard, Twilight-crazed fans, but I did really enjoy reading the novels and own the first movie on DVD. There was an excitement & buzz with the first Twilight movie and its young up- and-coming cast. This was a great story of sacrifice & forbidden love...However, by Eclipse, all the momentum & excitement built in the previous movies was GONE. I mean, as cold & dead as Edward Cullen's heart! The movie tries to carry the complicated, lovey-dovey relationship between Edward & Bella right from the opening scene -- but something is amiss. The lighting is fake, the vampire makeup way too pale & dramatic, and too many of the main characters have completely FAKE & distracting hair pieces (including Kristen Stewart wearing a terrible, oddly colored brown wig!).Bella's character & her dialogue had lost its pessimistic & sarcastic edge. All continuity from the previous movies was gone. I believe Stewart was also filming The Runaways, but ALL the actors were just going through the motions, I felt. They were more concerned with their hair, makeup, clothes & action shots than the edgy & dark story line. The dialogue too, particularly with Jacob, is laugh-out-loud cheesy. No wonder they just keep him on camera shirtless. Taylor Laudner will be lucky to ever land another real 'acting' gig again! He's eye candy, and not even that good looking when you actually study his face.I couldn't help but roll my eyes during much of this movie. I felt almost embarrassed for the cast! It was just cheesy around every turn. When there was supposed to be high drama & tension (Victoria is here! Or Jacob & the pack show up at Alice's graduation party! OMG!) -- nothing, nada, BORING! This movie just lacked the ups-and-downs & drama it had before. I can only hope that the final installments will get better, not worse.",4,6,8,13 December 2010
The Runaways," Terrible Sense of Aging, Growing & Time Passing
","I was excited to see what the young, new talent Kristen Stewart would bring to this great, edgy role. She was perfectly angst in Twilight, but could she be rock-n-roll enough? Could she lip sync? Act strung out?Although she did a good job (so did Dakota Fanning, who I think will eventually become a great long- standing actor), she did not blow me away. To me, she pretty much played her usual, sarcastic, mumbly angst role. This time in leather hot pants & a guitar. She just didn't show the acting range I was hoping to see.What I found most annoying about the movie was the non-existing capture of time passing -- of following these growing girls over the years. Suddenly they are 'rocking out' in a bus, then in a stadium in Japan?? How did THAT happen?? When did they go? How long were they there? Then why were they back playing on the bus after that?? After hitting it big? It just didn't make sense to me.And I don't really know the backstory of Joan Jett or the Runaways, I probably should, but this movie certainly didn't explain much to me. It didn't educate me to their lives or struggles, except that Joan went on to be successful as a solo artist and Cherie became a 'regular' person. But I could have learned that much about Joan Jett or Cherie Curry by just reading an old Rolling Stone. This movie just didn't give me much more to think about. It was choppy & confusing (how come they are not growing old, not showing the years pass by, what year is it?). It was really just an OK movie.",4,2,7,13 December 2010
