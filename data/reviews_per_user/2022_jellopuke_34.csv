Blade Runner 2049," the best possible sequel
","I will admit that I was dreading this. I was worried they were going to double down on the Harrison Ford is a replicant angle that Ridley Scott seems to push so much which in my opinion ruins the movie and is stupid, but they didn't! I was worried they were going to go all shaky cam, action overload, but they didn't! I was worried they'd dumb down the story and they didn't! This was all that I hoped it could be, with actual themes, characters, and drive. Loved it! Glad Ford was only in it for a short bit, glad that it had its own story while playing off the original, glad that it had something to say! So glad this wasn't another terrible Hollywood remake/reboot but was it's own thing!",10,4,12,4 November 2017
Gremlins," 80's classic
","Of course this is one of those perfect storms of horror/comedy that worked out and became a classic. It has everything you need, an original premise, great effects, interesting characters, humour, and a classic score. A definite one to watch over and over again.",9,3,4,5 January 2020
It," Better than I expected
","Not the biggest horror or King guy, but this was better than I thought I would be. It had a real Stranger Things vibe which worked, but the constant need to fall back on jump scares hurt it. I wish horror movies could be more restrained and rely on mood, tension, what you don't see rather than just things that go BOO! But it was fine and I'd say it's probably light years better than most of the crap that comes out nowadays.",7,2,3,1 October 2017
To Be or Not to Be," All-time classic!
","Very funny, bitingly satirical, suspenseful and well written. Still holds up today and must have been mind blowing in 1942!",10,1,2,24 November 2018
Citizen Kane," BEST EVER
",Having watched this maybe 12 times? I can safely say this movie is just the best. in every way. Just watch it over and over again and learn for yourself.,10,0,0,6 November 2019
Us," Great until the final 10 minutes
","I really liked this movie for almost the entire run time. It's well shot, acted, scored, paced, and creates a superb sense of tension and mystery. Then it all comes crashing down during the overly long and thorough exposition scene right before the end. Instead of leaving a little to think about, it tries to explain through a completely nonsensical and convoluted idea that seems just not thought out all the way through. It deflates all that came before it and nearly ruined the whole thing. But it would be unfair to pan something so well made and constructed simply for one dumb misstep. Overall, this was very good and shows that Peele is a major talent!",8,4,8,30 March 2019
The Irishman," Another notch on the belt
","A great gangster saga for Marty to get all the big time actors of the last 50 years together again. It may or may not be a pack of lies, but it's a grand story with loads of historical nuggets to chew on. Not as visceral or violent, more thoughtful but still excellent.",9,0,1,29 December 2019
Deadpool 2," Occasionally great
","This is a movie where 1000 jokes are tossed out at you but only a few stick. The rest fall flat or in some cases are really annoying, but the ones that land are great and almost make up for the movie being pretty pointless and by the book. The irreverence and need to poke fun of comic book tropes never quite supersedes the necessity of still being a comic book movie. It's a movie that has a few laughs, works well for comic fans, but overall is just kind of something that you move on from.",5,0,2,23 February 2020
Thor: Ragnarok," Lots of fun
","While I wish they'd dropped the villain of the week stuff and just made a movie about Thor and Hulk on weirdo planet overthrowing Jeff Goldblum, I realize that Marvel will never do that, so what we are left with is a movie that has some great comedy mixed in with the usual action fighting bits. The weirdness and goofiness was fun and I wish there was more of it and less of the Cate Blanchett stuff, but overall this was an enjoyable ride and worth seeing.",8,1,5,13 November 2017
Midnight in Paris," Wonderful bittersweet fantasy
","A movie of emotions and dreams and love and loss and acceptance. With amazing Paris backdrops and Owen Wilson doing the Allen part, it's a real treat with lots to say, done in a charming style. Proof that an older director can still knock one out of the park.",9,0,0,9 February 2020
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Revitalized the franchise.
",Arguably the best of all the spider man movies with a great pace and lots of heart. Changed just enough to be fresh but with plenty of call backs to the comics. Merging with the mcu was the best thing for this franchise.,9,5,7,3 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," May the Meh be with you
","Look, they had to undo lots of what TLJ screwed up so most of this is retconning and trying desperately to find something/anything to carry forward, but the first hour is awful and the whole movie is a giant video game of nonsense. BUT there are a few really strong scenes hidden away that show what we could have had if only Disney hadn't majorly dropped the ball with this whole trilogy. This is essentially just ROTJ redone, but with thinner characters and less coherence. Please leave this series alone for a long time now Disney, PLEASE.",5,7,11,29 December 2019
Top Secret!," Genius!
","So many amazing gags here, coming one after another. Not every one works, but you don't have to dwell on the clunkers because there'll be another ten before you know it. A couple of amazingly done off-the-wall scenes (underwater, backwards part) and lots of songs make this something to behold. It's so great, and somewhat passed over, but shouldn't be!",9,0,0,24 February 2019
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," Great parody movie
","Maybe this generations Spinal Tap? It's not all time like that was, but it's close. Some really great gags and songs go with the humdrum plot and standard tropes, but it's funny enough that it all works anyway. Worth a watch.",8,2,4,13 August 2018
Baby Driver," Another Edgar Wright winner!
",Fantastic style and use of music with amazing car chase scenes and a couple of tremendous lines. Edgar Wright does it again!,9,1,1,2 July 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Smart, funny, and heartfelt!
","Wow, I was not expecting this level of quality in a sony movie. It was well written with a lot to say and some real emotions mixed in with the tremendous art style. So glad to see the Kirby crackle on the big screen and the after credits stuff was great!",9,0,0,18 February 2020
Avengers: Endgame," A fine ending, but a Meh movie
","Yay! This ends the marvel movie franchise! What? It's doesn't. Ugh. Oh well, at least this wraps up a lot, ends the major villain plot, has a few laughs, and gives everyone a moment to shine. Sure it has a million logic and continuity flaws, but who cares when you're breezing through so fast. Doesn't feel like three hours and well worth watching. That said, I never want to see another marvel movie let alone re-watch one.",6,2,8,13 May 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Another in the never-ending stream of comic book movies
","Overly long and full of essentially nothing but CG battles, this movie has to squeeze in every character from all of the other movies into a wafer thin plot (bad guy wants to kill 1/2 of all life) - - - snore. Oh but wait, they 'humanize' the villain by having him cry once... wow THAT' S SO DEEP, WHATTAMOVIE! It's so sad that children's stories about people punching each other are all that we get in theatres now... but the crowd had a good time, so if you love these MCU movies, you'll probably love this. If you're over/bored of them, this won't change your mind.",5,9,36,29 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," 25 minutes too long
","Some of this was awesome, maybe his best work, but a lot was meandering and unnecessary despite the tremendous production value and period work. It's another symptom of the fact that no one can tell Tarantino to cut. He's too big and powerful and egotistical (not necessarily a bad thing) and really needs an editor/producer willing to stand up and say 'this movie would be a lot better if it was 15 minutes shorter... maybe 25'
That said, I did enjoy it and liked the 'twist' ending that really sold the fantasy aspect. If you ever wanted to know what Tarantino likes and feels, this is probably the most revealing movie he's made.",7,2,5,29 July 2019
The Elephant Man," Dark... so very dark
","This is a dark movie, showing a brutal time and a horribly deformed man who went through life abused and gawked at, until for a brief few moments, he wasn't. It's really good though.",8,1,1,30 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Solid Meh
","This wasn't the worst thing to happen to Star Wars like some are saying (that would be the prequels) but it certainly wasn't great either. It felt like they simply took moments from ESB and ROTJ and copy/paste rearranged them. You had the base escape from ESB only here it was at the end, you had the confrontation with the 'emperor' character from Jedi only here it was 2/3 through, you had the training from ESB only here it was the beginning, etc. Overall there were some totally terrible moments, i.e.) Leia floating through space that were laugh out loud bad, a completely pointless Finn whose entire sub plot could probably have been cut, and still no explanation as to who Snoke was, or how he came to power, or anything. Then Luke was a whiny coward and Leia had the worst smoker's voice imaginable. Overall there were some things I liked, some things I hated, and it left me not caring as much as to where it's going whereas TFA left me wanting to see what was coming next. Turning Luke into a ghost ... hey, where'd I see that before? Oh yeah, ANH ending... ugh. How about something new please?",6,0,0,16 December 2017
Jurassic World," A few great parts can't make up for a terrible script
","Awful characters cut out of cardboard and a recycled plot almost sink a movie with a couple of cool 'thrill' scenes, but overall it's a rehash with a preposterously stupid premise that falls apart to anyone with a brain.",5,0,0,4 July 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Solid sequel.
","Maybe not as good as the first but still lots of fun with great characters and solid set pieces. This is still an episodic serial, so you don't really get any major closure, but you do get a fun chapter in the ongoing overall story.",8,1,1,3 July 2019
The Disaster Artist," Solid, but the book was better
","Franco does a good job and they compressed a lot into the running time, but after reading the book, I was let down with some of the changes to make it into a more formulaic Hollywood story. But then I guess no one could really adapt such an oddball character and story into a movie and have people believe it. I'd suggest that you should watch the Room first, or at least be familiar with it before seeing this, but then, maybe for those that go in cold it might be enough... Hmmmm.",8,1,3,24 February 2018
It's a Wonderful Life," Maybe the perfect holiday movie
","I've watched this probably 6 times over the years and it's perfect at Christmas. Life affirming and relentlessly hopeful (and cynical) it portrays a world where people matter and life is worth living. Beautifully shot and acted, it's brilliantly written, even if the angel stuff can get a little clunky. Even after all this time, it still works and might even bring a tear to your eye. Watch it every year or so to feel replenished.",10,3,4,13 December 2018
"Hail, Caesar!"," Solid, but hardly their best work
","You really have to be in to old hollywood to get full appreciation out of this movie as it's full of references and homages. Everyone is playing a part of a famous director/producer/actor to the extent that this is almost a type of fan fiction. It's very well done, but just super 'inside.'",7,1,1,3 June 2018
Arrival," Great sci-fi!
","Sure you can see the twist coming a mile away and it might not totally make sense, (a couple of plot holes regarding her newfound abilities) but this is a solid and well made, intelligent, adult science fiction movie. No shoot outs, no alien punching, no cheesy one-liners, and no comic book nonsense! Yay!",8,2,4,30 August 2018
The Cannonball Run," Dated and painful in parts
","One of those movies that unfortunately does not hold up well. It has lots of stars with parts that barely give them anything to do. There's no real plot or forward momentum (odd in a car movie) and it's just a bunch of stuff that happens as an excuse for some stunts. It seems like it was loads of fun to make, but is just kind of there on screen. I remember loving this as a kid, but now, I was pretty bored. There was one moment that I laughed out loud at, but that was it.
It was interesting to see where Captain Underpants stole a lot from though...",5,0,3,8 September 2018
Black Panther," Yet another Marvel movie with the same basic plot
","Sure it's great to see different people on screen and there were a few attempts at addressing real world issues (usually in brief snippets of dialogue spelling it all out for you) but the hyperbole being dripped over this movie is insane. It's a ridiculous kids movie that has the exact same basic plot and action beats as almost all of the other marvel movies. This isn't the second coming here people. It's just a well made popcorn movie that you'll forget about in a few months. Can we please have one of these movies that doesn't involve the hero fighting a guy with the exact same powers as him? The only saving grace here is that there was no giant space laser. This is a well made product designed to sell you things and keep a massive money making franchise going. A lot of people worked to make it palatable and easy to digest, which it was, but it's not some kind of classic of cinema.",7,0,2,11 March 2018
What We Do in the Shadows," The best vampire movie in years!
",Really funny both with dark comedy and subtle genre parody. If you liked flight of the conchords then this will be right up your alley.,9,0,0,3 July 2019
Annihilation," Solid Sci-fi movie
","It's not about gun fights or laser swords, but about smart people going into an unknown situation and dealing with weirdness. Methodical and well shot, it's a great little movie that doesn't tell you everything.",8,3,10,25 February 2018
Jackie Brown," Solid and more mature movie from QT
","Some think this is his best, others his worst, but it's a very well made movie that has strong performances, a more subdued style, and a great soundtrack. It stays very close to the book and works quite well, but if you're expecting the flash of QT's usual movies, you'll be disappointed.",8,0,0,30 May 2020
True Romance," Decent, but not a classic
","For this time, this was pretty good, but viewed after the passage of time, you can see all of the affectations that Tarantino puts into all of his stuff here in the early stages (old movie talk, violent shoot outs, etc). That's not to say this is a bad movie, it's well made, with lots of stars in bit parts and is well shot, but it's hardly an all time great. Arquette has zero character other than loving Slater and dressing 'quirky' while Slater's character is just a Tarantino clone who loves Elvis. Everyone else is pretty much a trope, and that works out fine for a genre movie, but it's certainly not anything deeper or better. For Tony Scott, its one of his best though.",7,1,4,25 November 2018
The Nice Guys," Fun caper movie
","Some good laughs and wacky changes of fortune in this buddy comedy that works because Crowe and Gosling have good chemistry together. Sure there are way too many convenient coincidences in the plot and the ending goes a little over the top, but it was still fun and NOT another comic book movie, so give it a go.",8,1,2,16 June 2018
