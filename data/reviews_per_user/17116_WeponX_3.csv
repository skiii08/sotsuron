Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Not the best, but a night of decent fun.
","I saw a pre-screening with minimal expectations, and I must say it exceeded them, so that was good.To get things straight, I did not go into this thinking I was in for an amazing story or amazingly fleshed out characters. I don't see any reason these kinds of films can't be 10/10s when you take them in their proper context but it definitely leaves you wanting more out of what you watched, regardless of genre or expectations. There is a faint sense of something lacking in the film...okay maybe more like a molding cheese on a rotten apple stench, but that doesn't mean there still aren't more delicious snacks in this film's refrigerator! I would say the movie is simply flawed in small areas, nothing on a grand scale. There's lack of exposition on why certain things are the way they are, and essentially you have to suspend your disbelief further and further with every scene. There is a consistent lack of consistency in how the action scenes play out. This constantly leaving you wondering why characters didn't die amidst what you just saw on screen, or asking yourself 'how the f*ck did this black dude learn to flip around and fight vamps?', not to mention a few cheap set-ups with even cheaper payoffs. Even though you're not suppose to be looking too far into the action sequences for something like that, because they're made to look cool, and they do, but it definitely takes you out of the experience at moments because what you're seeing just completely defies logic, even within the universe they've created for this film. As I said, each new action scene requires you to expand your bandwidth of disbelief, and you can't help but notice that you're kind of accommodating the film's need for you to do that. Like a Russian Doll that never ends, you keep having to remind yourself, 'well the way this scene is playing out is f*cking retarded, but then again it is Abe Lincoln fighting vampires'. You shouldn't have to say that to yourself in a well done film, even of this genre. But this film is far from poorly done either.To get a little more picky, I'd say the first act of the film runs a little too fast, kind of rushing the development for Abe's vampire slaying character, which is unfortunate because the set up in the beginning was decent. So yeah things are a little speedy at first, especially after the inciting incident and first act turning point.Overall, a solid 6/10. Entertaining, over the top, and a little ridiculous for reasons other than the obvious. I put this one on the level of '21 Jump Street' in that even though it fulfilled many of the genre expectations, was decently entertaining, and had a lot of heart to it, both films still fall a little short because both seemed to forget what really matters to keep your audience curious, a decent story that we can get lost in as a viewer.I'm only giving the negative critiques I have of the film because you will still get what you want and expect from this film, fun visuals, a few laughs, some legitimately cool action scenes (and not just in the traditional sense, but something that actually seems a little fresh in style. Do I dare to claim after the 70 minute point or so the action gets a little too absurd?). The only thing that really stands out to me in the end is that it seems like there was no significant need for Honest Abe to be the protagonist. This could have worked just as well and been just as much fun with any other host of characters. The historical context wasn't really necessary for me. Maybe I'll scope the book and see how it works there.If you liked '300' and can deal with a story as coherent as '21 Jump Street' you will get some fun out of this. History buffs and Vampire buffs, stay away, I don't even know where to begin with the accuracy and lack of explanation issues for both American history and why it needs to tie into this story, and the lack of exposition on what may or may not have been altered in the vampire mythos.Watch this baked out of your mind and I can essentially assure a great time. Sober? Well I can't say I'd recommend it but I certainly wouldn't discourage anyone curious to check it out. If you actually wanna see this movie, I think based on that alone you will likely enjoy yourself!I came out feeling like I could have used a little more in certain areas of the film, but also felt like I had been entertained, but just not nearly as much as I should have been. I dunno, maybe compare it to Pauly Shore's best movie or something, minus his voice appearances in Disney films. Easily forgettable but potentially memorable. Overall, I think it's worth taking a risk on if you're pondering forking out the cash for it, but I'd recommend cheap Tuesday or a paid date.",6,6,13,21 June 2012
I Am Legend," Should have been better/Nothing like the book
","One thing can be established off the bat. This movie is not at all like the book. It is essentially a different story from the book. So if you're a fan of the book and you plan to watch this movie, simply be advised it is not the same at all.As a fan of the book, after watching this movie I felt a little cheated. My first impression was that it seemed like not a single one of the writers could have read the book. They honestly think it was appropriate to name this movie after it despite the fact that the only similarities with the book and the movie are the title, and the name Robert Neville. Now I'm not saying that a movie has to be just like the book it is based on, but it should try to stay true to the theme and plot as much as possible. Hollywood seems to have this habit of taking perfectly good stories and ruining them by compensating for story line with explosions and special effects.From a critical point of view, the film was up and down. For about the first 30 minutes it is quite well done. You can also see that they really tried to capture the psychological strain that such a situation could subdue a person to. Will Smith gives a sincere performance, and quite frankly he was pretty much all that salvaged this movie. Most of the people who are knocking on this movie aren't giving him enough credit. Even if you don't like Will Smith at all, he was really the only consistently decent piece of this film....him and the dog. The special effects seemed a little cheap. On top of that, the Dark Seekers who were being portrayed through the special effects, seemed to develop abilities that somewhat defied the laws of physics. Not to mention that they just didn't look that good or believable. All I can say is that I'm sure I could name at least five movies off the top of my head that are much older than this one that have CGI literally ten times better.(spoiler) One thing that really kinda gets me is that this movie was pushed and advertised with this 'The last man on earth, is not alone.' I'm sorry but what kind of garbage is that if 3/4 of the way through the movie a woman and her son come trotting along. Not to mention what happens at the end. I mean come on if you can't even stay true to your advertising scheme what credibility do you really have after that. Also I have a slight problem with the ending. It seems like the only reason Neville blows himself up along with the Dark Seekers is for dramatic effect. To solidify a justifiable reason for him being a legend.I Am Legend, could have been a much better movie. They could have even kept the same basic plot if they had just added more story. More background story, more explanation, more...ANYTHING! Bottom line this movie just seemed like it had no effort as far as writing and story line go.I must say though that I Am Legend is worth watching. It is an interesting story with a few visual treats. However, fans of the book should be prepared for something that likely will not live up to their expectations. As someone who was hoping for more than they got, I can say that unfortunately, I Am Legend, leaves no real legacy.",7,0,0,2 July 2008
The Dark Knight," Dark, different and twisted (review, no spoilers)
","Top notch and superb, The Dark Knight delivers all the goods. I particularly enjoyed the way the film transfered from scene to scene as it could satisfy a wide audience base by giving lots of story and information, without having to drag on and explain everything for half an hour at a time (This despite the fact that the movie surpassed the two hour mark). The way it is filmed reminds me of reading a comic book. As each new scene came about I found myself almost feeling like I was flipping the pages of a video comic.Heath Ledger is superb, and the Oscar hype he has received is well deserved. However, I hope those who give him that consideration truly feel that way. His performance as the Joker, as expected, is truly nothing like anything we have seen before. I fear that some may not see this performance for what it truly is, as Ledger's untimely death brought about a lot of attention. Hopefully people truly do feel that his performance is Oscar worthy, and aren't just blinded by the idea that this is his last film. The way he portrayed the Joker was twisted, funny, scary and unreal. Truly Oscar worthy material by Ledger if this movie gets the type of attention it deserves.All and all, The Dark Knight is a very new and refreshing take on the super hero movie. It offers a host of brilliant characters, twists and surprises, and a whole new look on filming styles for the super hero genre. All I can say is that I just can't wait to watch it again.",10,3,7,18 July 2008
