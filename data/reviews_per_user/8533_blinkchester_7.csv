The Ring," The film sure nearly killed me
","I watched the Japanese original a few months before i heard that Hollywood was making their own version of this film. The original, although not a unique idea, is a very interesting one if handled right. It was a very watchable horror, nothing special, but well worth a view.The remake however it a shambles. It takes a few good ideas from the film it is remaking, and also borrows from many other Hollywood horrors. The two films show the difference between the cinema from continent to continent. Japanese cinema is far more artistic and its audience view the films in a far different way. I can not imagine many traditional Japanese audiences enjoying Gore Verbinski's film.It has a few redeeming points. The special effects, as you would expect go some way to making the Hollywood version watchable, but as for the plot, it makes little sense, and we are simply not interested enough to unravel the bits that need us to.The usual horror conventions of the jump effect loud music are implmenented as the only way to scare us in this horror. The only thing this film will succeed in doing is making people want to watch the original and bringing it to Western audiences.Score this film 4 out of 10",Null,2,5,26 January 2004
Full Metal Jacket," Gripping emotional drama
","Who was it that said that Kubrick was only interested in technology and computers, and that he could not handle human emotions properly in his work. Full Metal Jacket is split into two distinct segments.The first half concentrates on the barracks. Told through the eyes of Modine, we centre on the torment of private `pile`. It is a very compelling and harrowing tale of the misery and bullying. We then go to Vietnam with our central character played by Matthew Modine. It shows war as chaotic, and brutal. It also perfectly sums up the pointlessness of the whole affair.This film is simply a masterpiece. Everything it handles, it does with panache and style. This is a film you must watch. 5 out of 5",Null,0,0,15 November 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," A nice sign off for a very good trilogy
","The original record breaking Matrix a few years back set my pulse racing. We had an action film, with a great backstory. We also had many hidden depths to the plot and narrative structure, and we had two directors who were happy to let you unravel their ideas all by yourself.The films are open to polysemic interpretations, and that is what makes the Matrix trilogy and philosophy so beautiful. The Matrix Reloaded improved on the original in many ways, and this film improves on them both.We take a step up in many new camera techniques, and we have a few technological advances from the first film. The bullet time technique had revoloutionised cinema, and the way films are made. It also was ridiculed from film to film, with even Dreamworks' Shrek getting in on the act.If you thought the first two films were complex, then this film will confuse you like nothing before. We may not have the psycho analysing architect to contend with, but we have a plot that seems to move in ways that we do not expect, yet think it should. Questions we thought would be answered, are left for us to amuse ourselves with.If you like closure and boundaries, then this film might not be the one for you. If you like action, gloriously choreographed fight sequences and the confusion of the what ifs, then you will love this film. Loose ends are not tied, and is peace closure. Is it really peace at all? Were you really watching this film and are you really reading this review...To sum it up. This film is so far my favourite of the year. The acting may be slightly wooden, and the love between Neo and Trinity does not really makes us feel very passionate. The dialogue in places appears over written and very Capraesque, but who cares? The Matrix is clever, and inspiring. I love it",Null,0,0,15 November 2003
The Shining," A different adaptation
","Fans of this movie will of course know that it came from Stephen King's novel of the same name. That is about the only similarity it shares with the novel though. Where as King's novel delved into a man who became something else, and went insane, Kubrick's film initially deals with an already insane character. If anyone was going to become a mad ax murderer, it was Kubrick's character.The film barely touches on the psychological studies evident in the book. It hardly mentions or deals with the shining, which was a gift that both Danny and Jack had. Jacks punishment came about because of his rejection of the gift. The film overlooks all of that. The film also replaces the metaphors within the book. Where as King used the boiler to show Jack's pent up rage, Kubrick decided to use the maze. The maze was symbolic of the maze of Jack's mind. Lost deep within himself the maze became a dangerous space, and gradually darkens throughout. It is also symbolic that Jack dies within the maze in the film. As they take away the shining from the novel, they simply use the cook as a sacrificial lamb, rather than a surrogate father figure for Danny and a superb foil to JackThe film asks the questions, are the ghosts real or simply psychological manifestations of Jack's deluded mind? Just because the film does not adhere to the book, does not make it a bad adaptation. I loved this film, and the study of an already mad man takes nothing away from the film. We no longer have the study of American society and the hotel as a microcosm of America, we just have pure suspense, and a high level of entertainment.Kubrick simplified the plot to go for the entertainment, and he superbly uses music and cutting to provide high suspense. He even makes the wife and child two dimensional characters, to concentrate on the lunatic that Nicholson plays brilliantly.The shining is a superb film. Not highly scary, but it does succeed in making you jump in all the right places. Watch it if you dare",Null,0,1,5 November 2003
Ocean's Eleven," Slick, stylish, suprising
","I must say that i did really like this film, its very enjoyable. It does have no substance behind it, but i guess everyone is entitled to some no thrills enjoyment now and then.The actual heist is very well done. It is by no means a classic, but like the whole film. Its clever and very smooth. Pretty much like the main cast members. Clooney and Pitt are perfect in their roles. They have the same spirit and charisma of the whole film.If you like pure mindless entertainment and the gung-ho American attitude, then watch this film, you'll love it. After thinking more about it, i am ashamed at just how much i did",Null,0,0,9 November 2003
Love Actually," Enjoyable, Funny, Sensitive and...... not quite the finished article
","I hardly know where to begin in reviewing this film. It is possibly one of my favourite romantic comedies, and i have seen a lot of them; it is one of the perils of having a movie loving girlfriend.A movie that has so many main characters who are central to the narrative usually finds it difficult to immerse the audience within it. Black Hawk Down was a prize example. Ridley Scott produced a great visualisation of the attrocities of war, yet because he had over 30 characters to associate with, we lost interest in them. Love Actually managed to keep us interested in all the little tales that go on. Some of the scenes, or should i say sketches, touch on the borderline of decency, but sometimes decency can be sacrificed for cheap humour, if done cleverly. Key characters that i enjoyed watching were the aging rock star, who reminded me of people such as Ozzy Osbourne and Johny Rotten, and Hugh Grant's Prime Minister, who was such a likable character, that we can not help but want him to fall in love with Martine McCutcheon.Keira Knightley is wasted in such a small two dimensional role, but it does add something for the young lad, as once again she looks stunning. Liam Neeson plays a funny father teaching his son about love and sex. The film does boast a very good cast, although a lot of them are left scrounging over small roles, or playing cameo roles, which fortunately do not detract from the tone of the film.Possibly if the film had centred on less characters, and concentrated more on the endearing ones, then i would be telling everyone to go and see it. The way it is.... well its still worth a watch, and i have to admit i loved it",Null,0,2,16 November 2003
Platoon," Perfection... or as close to it as we're ever likely to see
","Its hard to know where to start with such a breathtaking film. Oliver Stone's Platoon is quite simply the best Vietnam war film ever made in my opinion. Everything about it is as close to perfection as we are likely to see. Charlie Sheen plays the lead, and Willem Defoe and Tom Berenger play the two sergeants that form a key part of the plot.Chris Taylor (Sheen) is torn between the sergeants. Barnes (Berenger) is the battle hardened, brutal murderer, who uses the war as an excuse to tender to his sadistic pleasures. Elias (Defoe) is the other side of the spectrum. We get the sense that he has wrestled with his inner demons, but he has successfully come through to the other side. He has compassion for his fellow man, and he uses drugs as a form of escapism from this brutal war. The two symbolise the struggle that Taylor must face if he is to survive out in Vietnam.Oliver Stone perfectly captures war. The shooting is frantic and impossible to follow. It perfectly disorientates us, just as the soldiers were. We have no idea who is being shot at, and neither do they. We follow the war at ground level, and see the brutalities first hand. Having served in Vietnam, the film is loosely based on Stone's time out there, and Taylor loosely based on himself.Full Metal Jacket showcases how inhumane the war was, Apocalypse Now turns it into a story about life in general, and hopelessness, but Platoon has everything. Trying hard to avoid the old cliché, but if you only watch one war film, make sure it is this one. Nothing else can come close.",Null,227,288,28 April 2004
