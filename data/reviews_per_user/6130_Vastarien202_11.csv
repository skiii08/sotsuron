Requiem for a Dream," Downward Spiral
","I had anticipated this movie for some time, so when it came out, I went across town to the one theater brave enough to show it. I was not prepared. By the end, everyone, EVERYONE,even the jocks who'd ditched school was openly crying for these poor people on screen. When the lights came up, we all filed out in total silence. What could you say?! I literally had no words for the rest of the day, for anyone. I have rented this film several times, but I just can't watch it again. I am haunted by the incredible music, the embodiment of sorrow and despair, performed by the impeccable Chronos Quartet. I have never loved a movie more. If you want happy endings, go somewhere else. If you want the truth, watch this movie. But never say you weren't warned.",10,0,1,19 October 2005
Silent Hill," Whoa!
","I got to see this flick when it came out, and I had the theater mostly to myself. Unfortunately, I had to sit really close, like 2nd row because my friend couldn't see farther back and he refuses to wear glasses. This had the unfortunate result of yours truly having to watch this while being somewhat motion-sick. Not the best way to watch intense gore. I will say this, though: despite my queasiness, I really did scream in fear many times, and I almost NEVER do that in any movie. The last ones that had me cowering so were the Ringu series and Audition.(BTW, I still fear Sadako like nothing on earth.) I watched my friend play all the games before seeing the film, so that did help, but I must admit that I wanted to make that stupid woman stop yelling for her kid every 3 seconds. If I were in an evil town with demons running loose, the LAST thing I'd do is run about making lots of noise. All in all, I give it 7 out of 10. Please do NOT take ANY children to this, I had to hear some tit-bag trying to calm her screaming kids down all through it, and they were all 10 and under. Stupid git.",7,0,1,7 June 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Pure awesome
","I waited for this to come out on DVD, and rushed home with it as soon as the store opened. When it started, I was awed. When it was over, I was balled up on my floor sobbing hysterically. I have never seen such a truly profound film in my life. It's not about a Faun, a girl, or an end of childhood. It's really about strength, courage, innocence and a will to do what is right above all else, no matter what the cost to one's self. This is a true masterpiece of film-making, from the gorgeously lush countryside to the dingy interiors. I will say this, as much as I truly enjoy this movie: I will never forgive Guillermo for making me cry so hard I almost heaved. No one else has ever hurt me that badly, and done it so beautifully. You owe it to yourself to watch this film as soon as possible. Just don't forget to bring a box of tissues. You'll need them all.",10,2,5,2 December 2007
28 Weeks Later," Best movie of the Summer?
","This is not just another bland sequel to a great movie! This film actually holds its own until the final frame, never letting up. 28 weeks later single-handedly restored my faith in horror, taking its audience to new levels of violence, mayhem, gore, and dread. The music was perfect,no whiny pop crap, just throbbing instrumentals carrying the scenes of chaos. Gore-hounds will not be disappointed, the blood runs in the streets of a deserted London and beyond. True horror buffs will recognize a possible nod to Lucio Fulci in one scene, see if you can spot it. This is not a film for the faint of heart or of stomach. It's rated R for a reason, so leave the kids at home! At the showing I went to, some twit had brought their 4 year-old to this movie! The poor kid was terrified, and had to be constantly comforted by the parents, nearly ruining the movie for everyone else. I hope you will enjoy this film as much as I did, and that nobody brings a child into your theater.",10,40,81,12 May 2007
Edward Scissorhands," Genius!
","I saw this one in the theater when I was small, and later many times at home. I never get through it without crying. The score is lovely, never overpowering the story. Edward himself is fragile, yet he had such a desperate nobility to him, and he was so alone...he stands in marked contrast to the apes around him, normal on the outside, but cruel and flawed inside. If you look closely, the neighbors seem to embody one or more of the Seven Sins, while Edward is the tragic innocent.This movie works on so many levels, and still holds up today. Vincent Price shines in his last performance as the Inventor, a small but crucial part that no one else ever would have got right. A truly excellent film, but don't watch it without your hankies ready.",10,3,5,28 September 2005
Twilight," This is why the terrorists hate us
","What can I say about this movie? It's incredibly boring, like Edward, vapid and aimless with no imagination or emotion, like Bella, and an absolute chore to sit through. Frankly, I have seen five-year-olds with more acting ability and passion. This really is a vampire movie, because it sucks the life out of the audience and leaves you starving for actual talent. When I finished watching this, I immediately put in my old WWF tapes, so I could see some GOOD acting and plot. It's a sad commentary on us as a people when drivel like this becomes successful. I haven't subjected myself to the books because I don't want to be seen in public with them. The shame and anguish of having seen this movie was more than enough.",1,13,145,16 January 2010
2012," This movie makes Tango and Cash look like American History X
","As others have said before me, this film sucks. It sucks as an action film, it sucks as a drama, it sucks as a family film, and it sucks by existing. With that out of the way, the one thing thing it does well at is un-intentional comedy. I have never, and I mean never, laughed so hard in public. I was on board with the seriousness until I saw a subway train come hurtling out of the ground and barely miss a small plane. At that point, I literally laughed so hard, I actually sprinkled! I got lots of dirty looks from some of the other people in the showing, but I just could not take anything in this film seriously. It's one big joke from start to finish, and it's hilariously bad. Not one person ever acts believably, except for the incredibly annoying daughter. She shrieks and sulks her way through it all with amazing consistency, and I just wanted to shoot her in the face after five minutes. Speaking of mercy-killing, the black scientist is the next one I'd take out. (SPOILER ALERT!!!) Seriously, this man has zero concept of what 'survival of the species' means. When he sees the room which has been prepared for him, he freaks out ans gasped 'You could fit 10 people in here!' Yes,probably, but that's not the point. This moron would rather have an ark jammed with starving, disease-ridden humans instead of a few clean, healthy ones. He seems to think the human race would be better served by letting a huge, panicked crowd onto a ship which is literally minutes from launch. If I had been in charge of the mission, this man would have been shot in the head the moment he opened his mouth about what it means to be human. Next, I would have found the stow-aways and killed them too. The mission would run as planned, and no crap about selfless brotherhood would enter anyone's mind. I have to agree with the Joker when it comes to human nature: 'These people are only five days from eating each other at any time.' For proof of this, look at what happens in any area hit by disaster.This movie wants us to think we would all put aside our differences and work to our mutual benefit. I call bull on that one. The secret program would be doomed from the start, because every nation would want to control who got on the ships and who didn't. In the end, the various governments would just start a massive nuclear war to kill most of the population off, and scrape whoever was left in the bunkers into the ships. That way, there would be close to zero competition for any remaining resources, and no question about who was in charge. (END SPOILER)Seriously, this movie is great if you chuck your brain out the window and treat it as a comedy. If you do anything else, you will be sadly disappointed.",3,0,1,6 December 2009
The Mist," Awesome
","I just got done watching this, and I must say that I am impressed. King's story has actually been expanded on in a way that enhances it, instead of just ripping it to shreds for a few more bucks. The interplay between the characters was very well done, and it felt authentic. Some viewers have taken offense to the way a religious person was portrayed here, and her actions upon the rest of the group. Unlike some, I know that this was a MOVIE, not a smear campaign. One could call their ability to tell fact from fiction into question, but we'll let that go for now. As it stands, this was hugely entertaining, and a great cross-section of humanity in crisis. I actually like the ending, as it forces you to see the true face of Horror. (No, it's not the Giant Walker. It's human failure.) Definitely worth buying, but I would wait until the special set comes out, if there is one.",8,10,21,16 April 2008
The Nightmare Before Christmas," joy
","I got to see this movie in the theater the first time it came out, and I was blown away! I rushed out and got the soundtrack, and wore out the tape in 2 months. I love the story, and the in-joke sight gags. I laugh every time I see Lock, Shock, and Barrel (wink!), they remind me of my mom saying, 'Don't make that face, you'll stick like that!' I also noticed that Santa has an industrial complex, and the Halloweens have to make their stuff by hand. Christmas Town was bright and shiny, but it seemed...a bit too slick. Their houses were all the same, but Jack's people had interesting houses that sometimes looked like their owners. I think the songs were great, they helped move some of the plot forward and explain things, instead of just having Phil Collins puke on everything. ( possible spoiler alert!!) I liked the shy romance between Jack and Sally, even though Jack doesn't realize that's what it is until the end. Jack starts out wanting only the best for his people, but in trying to be this new thing, he becomes blinded by his own need for change, and starts to believe his own epic myth. Redemtion comes at a terrible price, the destruction of his great dream, but in the end, Jack regains a sense of pride and purpose in the way he was, the way he was meant to be...The Pumpkin King.",Null,1,2,28 September 2005
Carrie," Sad fact of life
","I remember reading the book in 6th grade and feeling so very close to Carrie. I was the outcast for all of my schools, no matter where we moved the monsters would find me. I wished so hard for powers of my own, but I never got them. This is a wonderfully done film, and a true landmark of its kind. While the fashions and music have dated considerably, it's still a great study of how our culture eats its young alive, and even encourages victimization of others, through religious intolerance, social class, perceived intelligence as a threat, and on and on. The true ugliness of American culture is all here, and we hope you like what you see. The sad fact is, most of us nerds never get our day, we just quietly die in bedrooms and hang from swingsets. We are the ones who get punished for 'acting out' when simply trying to defend ourselves from butt holes. Those same jerks never get anything more than a slap on the wrist, while we get suspended. Is it any wonder why so many of us die young?! Some of us choose to take a few of our tormentors with us, but let's be honest, the Columbine Kids just couldn't AIM. That's the real tragedy, not a bunch of privileged snots. Carrie avenged us all.",10,18,31,17 August 2007
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Like pure liquid gold.
","I just finished watching this movie, and I must declare it...almost perfect. I love the animation style, the color choices, the almost-touchable textures, and thoroughly enjoyed the story itself. What didn't I like? Thankfully, there are very few things I disliked; but my major bone to pick was sadly one of the casting choices. For some reason (maybe I'm just too familiar with him), hearing George Clooney as Mr. Fox himself just didn't gel with me. I just couldn't accept this voice coming from that character, and it was rather hard not to see the person over the puppet. Perhaps if I was younger and had no real idea who Clooney was, it may have set better. In any case, that's really the only serious issue I had with the film itself. The story itself is nothing short of brilliant; it really does have something for everyone without being stupid. It's one of the few 'family' films lately that has the 'nards to toss a bit of grimness and real darkness into the mix.Mr. Fox's actions DO have very severe consequences, not only for his own family but everyone around him as well. The ending itself is rather ambiguous and somewhat poignant, which suits the tale well. This is a rare and fleeting beauty of a film, see it while you can, and add it to your collection when it comes out.",8,0,3,13 January 2010
