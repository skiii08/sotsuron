Casablanca," As near to a perfect movie as one could hope for!
","As near to a perfect movie as one could hope for! The performances are flawless, and the story line is gripping. I can't say enough good things about this film. If you're looking for a film that you can watch with the whole family, this is a great option. It's very romantic. I highly recommend it!",10,1,2,3 March 2017
Am√©lie," A really cute movie
","This is a delightful film! There are so many heavy, depressing things happening in the world today - we all need an escape from time to time. This film is uplifting and inspirational, just a really lovely little gem of a movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I'm not much one for foreign movies.",9,1,3,3 March 2017
