The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Response to LIANPELED
","OK Mr Lianpeled.I read your review as I was hoping to watch this film, but firstly wanted a bit more info. After reading your review I don't know how anyone could take any of yours seriously, when you try to imply that movies which are split in to different parts IE PT1, PT2, PT3 etc cannot and do not work. If this is the case could please give your reviews on a little film which is also filmed in parts known as THE GODFATHER!!! You could also try and explain this to the Star Wars Fans out there. And while you at it.......LORD OF THE RINGS!!!!!!!!!!! Unfortunately for you, your talents as a critic lack total credibility from your false statement. ANYONE ELSE WITH ME ON THIS GUYS? I am still to view this film but I am sure I will judge it on its own merit rather than it being split into 2/3 parts!!! Good day to you sir!",Null,6,8,27 December 2014
