Love and Death," Woody's best
","I will agree with the other comments that this is one of Woody's finest and funniest films ever.  One thing that I found rather interesting was Woody's homage to Sergei Eisenstein's POTEMPKIN.  It is unfortunate that this also seems to be one of Woody's more obscure films.  If you're a Woody Allen fan and you've not seen this film, I implore to run to your nearest video store and grab a copy!",9,0,0,28 September 1999
