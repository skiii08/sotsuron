The Ring," Best Horror Movie of the new millenium!!!
","Starts out as a standard horror movie and then grabs you and does not let go until the end and even when you think it ends, it does not!!!  I have not been on the edge of my seat in a movie since 'Silence of the Lambs.' There are lots of clues throughout the film, but you cannot put all of them together until the end-credits play.  Definitely see this movie!!!!!",10,0,0,20 October 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Totally awesome
","I just got done seeing the second installment of the greatest 5 movies the planet has ever seen and this installment secures that status even more. the movie is a bit long but is more than made up for with a good story and great special effects.  The action depicted buy the Jedi Masters and their apprentices, i.e. Anakin Skywalker, are spectacular.  Yoda kicks major a!@ against Count Dooku!!!  Mace Windu show what the force can do in dire circumstances and theri are plenty of great Jedi to try to save the galaxy from the Dark Side.  Definitely a must see!!! I plan on going again to take in everything that the long movie has to include in this awesome series. Thank you George Lucas!!!!",10,0,0,18 May 2002
Batman Begins," This is what the other Batman movies should have been like
",The movie is easily the best that Hollywood has made for the Batman character. Christian Bale is wonderfully supported by a top notch cast and does a wonderful job of showing the character as a possible real world character instead of just a comic book character. Other DC Comic movies should take a lesson and keep in mind for future movie installments. The character has more depth and you get a real good idea of how and why Batman came into existence. The movie also shows the beginnings of all the familiar characters in the series (Police Officer Gordon and Alfred). There is none of the 'circus' atmosphere and better action than in any of the previous Batman movies combined. A definite must see!!,10,2,4,20 June 2005
Meet Joe Black," Why did I wait so long?
","I just saw this movie and am wondering why I waited so long to see this wonderful film. The songs and the acting took me to places that few moveis ever have. Brad Pitt does a wonderful job as 'Death', giving the character depth and feeling. He is all at once naive, sweet, bold and daring. You actually believe that death does not have any experience with interacting with people and yet understands love at the end of the movie better than any other entity. Sir Anthony Hopkins is wonderful as the man that challenges death while realizing that he is on borrowed time. The way he acts between protecting his daughter and teaching death about life in just a short period of time was the best acting I have seen Sir Hopkins give since Silence of the Lambs. Definitely a must see for the hopeful romantics of the universe!!!",10,1,2,15 October 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Words cannot express
",This is the culmination of the GREATEST story ever told put to film.  I read and saw previews of what the last installment was going to be.  I saw in the extended editions how Peter Jackson said that this would blow the other 2 movies out of the water.  I did not expect this installment to be beyond even the praises of even the directors' comments.  The perfect ending to the best trilogy ever made or will be made.  I feel sorry for anyone trying to make another trilogy and come close to being this good!!!  I do not believe it can be done!!!,10,0,1,18 December 2003
