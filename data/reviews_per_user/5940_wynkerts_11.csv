Catch Me If You Can," Quite Enjoyable - funny often times.
","I liked this film; it was never boring despite the 2+ hrs length. DiCaprio, Hanks, and Walken gave standout performances, and were thoroughly believable. Hanks had a great Boston accent. The movie was fast paced and there were a lot of laughs throughout. Watch for the schoolteacher impersonation and stewardess recruiting scenes! This plot would have been absurd if it wasn't a true story. Sure, they dramatized the story for the film. I saw in the closing credits that a Frank Abagnale was listed as 'French policeman'!",Null,0,0,28 December 2002
United 93," Clear focus: what happened on the ground, and what possibly happened on-board
","I watched United 93 on opening day Friday. Not many people in the theater, despite all the controversy and the media talking about the movie non-stop. There are countless 'Is it too soon?' discussions on TV all the time.Anyway, the film was well made - focused only on the flight, against the background of the events of 9/11. It was a like a camera happened to be observing the incidents as they happened. No flag waving patriotism, no jihadist anti-American rhetoric from terrorist organizations - just a re-enactment of what happened that day.Many of us watched NYC, The Pentagon that day. I kept thinking back to how it was that morning. The jammed phone lines, the incoming calls, the images, the chaos.... My roommate had left from Logan airport just that morning, from the gate next to one of the hijacked planes.And the theories, the rumors, the controversies... days and months after. Especially about flights 93 and 77. Were they shot down? Did the passengers really save the White House/ US Capitol by bringing United 93 down? 'Let's Roll' is barely heard. I recall particularly how people stopped being sympathetic to Lisa Beamer, after she became a media princess.The film has none of this. It shows what happens on the plane right from boarding/taxi among passengers, and hijackers on this particular flight. It shows events on the ground among air traffic controllers, and NORAD in response to the attacks. That's it. It ends in abrupt fashion, because there can't be any more to show.",10,1,4,1 May 2006
Spider-Man 2," Spidey's a loser, total loser. Where's the Hero?
","I go to watch a superhero film to see a superhero - a being that has extraordinary powers, that can perform amazing feats and importantly be a WINNER. I don't want to watch him be a loser, be ordinary, and keep getting hammered, beaten up, and ridiculed. This movie...jeez, where's the superhero? Tobey MacGuire looks like a loser throughout, and is unconvincing overall. He (true to his usual roles) shows no steel or a desire to win. If the idea was to portray a mortal mushy goof, then don't call the film 'Spider-man'. 'Loser-Man' would be appropriate as he's in frustratingly (to viewers) loser situations all through this film.I believe most people don't give a hoot about their superhero wrestling with his goddamned personal issues and his desire to be a normal human. Just acknowledge your powers, beat the cr*p hard outta the villain, and be done with it. Then the audience goes out satisfied, having seen feats they aren't capable of. For them, to have such abilities is divine - why would they care to understand his desire to be ordinary? In this case, the humanized Spidey comes out a mortal sap, he is a loser - always humiliated. He never ever retaliates immediately or convincingly. There's NO sting, no quick strike-back that makes us go, 'Yea! Git the Bastard!'. Spoiler: I was overcome with irritation at the # of times Spidey's web shooting wouldn't work. Suddenly, for no reason. Bring back IL' Supe.... Superman anyday. He always came back quickly after his 'self-discoveries', and rammed 'em all to kingdom come.",Null,0,0,1 August 2004
Spider-Man," After all the hype, not bad. 3*/5*
","Watched the film today after 2 weeks of planning to. Moved seats after a kid next to me kept telling Peter/Spidey what to do onscreen.Spider-man is watchable - there's action, fun, humor, and a moral message. One really has to be wary though - are we seeing what we want to see, with so much interest in the film and the $$ records it's broken. Would I come out saying 'wow!', just because so many others said so?The movie progresses through the scenes fast as it should. The standout characters were by Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe). Dafoe is a master actor, amazing as always - his presence can't be ignored whenever he's onscreen. There're plotholes of course, but we watch a film like this for the action sequences and the effects, and plain entertainment - not for the screenplay.",Null,0,0,20 May 2002
Paranormal Activity," Step into the theater late - like 1 hour after the start.
","Yes, there's been a lot of hype for Paranormal Activity, and that brought me in too. The movie is best watched in a theater, and at night, and with an audience that knows to shut up.And then go home to try and resist imagining the same things happening in your house. Oh you will imagine - just about the time you turn off the lights before trying to sleep. And then you'll turn them on again. It's very very difficult to shake off PA when home.That said, I recommend this, and save prospective viewers a lot of time: 1.- Go into the theater an hour after the show starts. Until then, pretty much nothing happens(Now that everyone kinda knows about the story,the couple and the presence in their house - catching up is no problem) 2.- Take a few minutes to get a feel for the situation on screen, and 3.-Focus from the time she wakes up, goes over to his side of the bed, and stares at him for a couple hours. This is like 2 minutes before the film ends.That's all there is in this movie. The last 2.5 minutes of PA will make the impact that everyone's raving about. Save the first hour for anything else you have planned, outside the theater.Trust me. :)",8,1,3,18 January 2010
Vanilla Sky," Rather decent, Cruise plays the part very well.
","Vanilla Sky is an interesting film, that also requires you to pay attention. It has been said this film is confusing, but I was prepared for that as I'd read a couple reviews on Cnn and on Boston. This film is not boring and plays out a little over 2 hrs. A lot of detail and complicated scripting. Tom Cruise does an excellent job as David Aames, the flamboyant publishing heir whose face gets disfigured. I thought all the actors were competent - Jason Lee does another buddy turn in this film. I can somehow only see him as 'Banky'.",Null,0,0,14 December 2001
Trainspotting," Really bad and overrated film.
","I thought this was one of the worst films I'd ever seen. Really don't know what the fuss is about - with all the comments of praise. I think people are praising this trashy film, just cos others think it's cool and 'in'. Be original and see the film for what it is - a piece of highly overrated, gross-out, depressing TRASH.All it does is try to shock with some gross out scenes designed to win awards at Indie film fests. Disgusted.",Null,1,7,15 September 2001
Signs," Truly a cult classic for generations.
","This was truly an awesome film that kept me and my fellow audience enthralled from beginning to end.  M.Night rocks with his mixture of thrills and humor all through 'Signs'. All the acting is first rate - Gibson is amazing in his role as the ex-minister, and Joaquin Phoenix does a competent job. The kids are amazing - Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin rock as Gibson's children. The little girl is cute as hell! You gotta admire the way the young director interperses the tension with the humor.Certain Shyamalan trademarks: Reflection images, flashbacks, the whole noir touch... this guy is way ahead of the field. **Spoilers** First off, we only get hints of the aliens throughout the movie, we hardly see them until the end. There's suspense and excitement throughout. Night keeps the focus on the family of Fr. Hess and the way they react to the unworldly happenings around them.8/10 easy.",Null,0,1,4 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Fell asleep, twice. Refused to end.
","Time for the trilogy to end... and it did slowly. The characters kept talking and talking - the film dragged on, until each member of the audience was colossally bored. Tolkien is an overrated author, and anyone can create gooks and goblins - and create oddball characters, cheesy names and kingdoms. It's a crock. Anyone can make up fantasy - and hence I guess I'm not a fan of the genre.",Null,0,1,17 February 2004
300," Awful | inaccurate.
","This film is an abomination. An absolute shame. <ul><li>God-awful artificial picturization, comic book scenery, extreme dramatization, exaggerated battle victories. - Xerxes was hardly the tyrant as depicted in the film. He was a magnanimous and great king who stood for citizens' rights, per historians. - The film has offended Zorastrians, and people of Persian descent to the extreme. - The people shown as Persians do not look even remotely from that region. Get your facts straight. There aren't Africans in the Caspian region. - Per 300 - all that's white's right. Everything that's brown/black is not.</li></ul>Disgusted.",1,5,13,25 March 2007
Slumdog Millionaire," A shameless over-hyped movie; insulting to an entire nation.
","Yet another example of hype obscuring reality. Why, why is this movie acclaimed so? It's dishonest, it's disgusting, it's not believable, and it panders to the needs of a western audience. They see what they want to see and believe.And there are so many people celebrating, and in India? An Indian/Indian origin cast, staff, viewers in India, Indian show hosts, news anchors .... do they know what just happened? A horrible stereotype was reinforced - again. That with a shoddy story, and nonsensical situations - many of which have been mentioned by other viewers.Dump this by the other piece of garbage by Danny Boyle - 'Trainspotting'.",1,61,132,12 January 2009
