The Legend of Bagger Vance," Hurrah For Hollywood
","Hurrah for Hollywood! The Legend of Bagger Vance is a triumph! A triumph of movie making and a triumph of the will of man. Seemly a golfing movie it soon leaves this premise far behind as it takes us into the realm of the mystical and of the spirit and will of mankind. It is totally engrossing and a bright star in the resume of Robert Redford. An actor director who has given us of his talents for more than forty years, a gift for which we must be truly grateful",Null,0,1,4 June 2001
