The Blair Witch Project," Beautiful
","The Blair Witch Project is absolutely amazing.  When you leave the theater, you'll hate it.  You'll despise it with a hatred that will leave your blood curdling.  But, when you sit down to think about it, analyze it, probe it for what it means and what it was meant to mean, you'll love it.  Three minutes after you've seen it, it'll be on your list of the five worst movies ever made.  However three hours after you've seen it, you'll place it in your top five favorite movies.  I do recommend not going into the movie thinking that it will be the scariest movie ever made. Enjoy.",Null,1,1,30 July 1999
