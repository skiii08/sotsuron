Requiem for a Dream," This film is Amazing
",This movie is absoluty brillant. There is not a single flaw in this film. Everything from the script to the acting to the music is breath taking. Never have i felt so many emotions or so much emotion well viewing a film. It is on rare ocasion when you fell what the characters fell. I am astonished at this film. Anyone who does not view this film is depriving them self.,10,0,1,30 January 2002
