10 Cloverfield Lane," Good film Bad sequel
","Okay so for starters if more than half of your audience can't tell if this is a sequel or not to your film than it's already off on the wrong foot. This movie had absolutely nothing to do with the original Cloverfield and that's probably because it originally was called something else and then they decided to say it was a follow up to Cloverfield. Now I'm conflicted because while I enjoy these type of films and I did enjoy the movie in no way was it a good follow up to the original. I think we all can agree the first one was filmed pretty bad and god forbid you had motion sickness and tried to watch the original however it was action packed pretty much from start to finish. You got to see the military fighting the huge monster and the smaller alien creatures were attacking the main characters at times and even infected one of them. Not to mention the fx they did with the statue of liberty's head. It was just intense.So logic dictates if they did a sequel shouldn't it be even more epic? This movie looked like it would be the first not the sequel. I mean you had a good cast, good story line, and good performances but this movie could very easily have been its own thing as opposed to a sequel. The aliens in the end weren't even the same as the original film and there were no spaceships in the original it was just a good old fashioned creature film in the tradition of Godzilla. I absolutely hate this film as a sequel but if it was its own thing it would have been good to me.In laymen the original was like The Walking Dead and this film was Fear the Walking Dead. One's awesome and one's pointless.",5,1,4,23 March 2016
It Follows," Disappointing but not a bad film
","I'll start with the good. This movie was filmed well and paid tribute to the pace and camera techniques of horror films from the late seventies early eighties and even the score had a great eighties horror movie vibe to it. The characters were fairly interesting and the story started out intriguing. I could see the similarities to the infamous IT even obviously in the title just adding the word 'follows'.I could count on one hand the scenes that truly had shock value and you have to appreciate those moments because you truly don't know exactly what's going to happen so the suspense is there. The problem I had with this film was I really didn't think the story was strong enough. There really is no decent explanation of what 'it' actually is even though the boy who gives 'it' to her (strangely enough through sex) goes into it a bit at the beginning. It being some sort of creature that pretty much just appears as people. Sounds interesting but at times it was like okay is that a person walking by or is that 'it'.I just felt a little disappointed that 'it' wasn't something more interesting and that 'it' often took too long to appear not to mention how it's passed and how to get rid of it at times was clear and then confusing and why would something evil be passed through sex. Felt like this movie was written by a Mormon or something trying to make you fear pre-marital sex or something. Anyway 'it' without a doubt unfortunately was not much more than a really twisted STD of some sort.The direction was awesome and the score too and the acting was just fine but the puzzle piece missing was more intrigue, more story and a bit more horror. It was just lacking but not a bad film. Check it out but wait for Red box or Netflix.",5,6,21,1 April 2015
Magic Mike XXL," Pitch Perfect 2 again, pointless remakes
",Well I'll start by saying I know these are movies about male stripping but I still take them seriously as films. So the first movie had way more stripping which is a common complaint about XXL by most women because you'd think the sequel would have more. However I think the reason is because the first movie was solely about the life of a stripper but XXL is more of an unexpected bro. road trip movie leading up to a stripper convention. The first Magic Mike however had more of a dark direction making it more dramatic and less fun whereas XXL is more vibrant and less dramatic. The main thing lacking from the first film was Amber Heard. The actress in the first film just had no presence on screen and showed no personality whereas Amber Heard is sort of your go to hot blonde perfect for playing these types of characters. I think the fact that there was no sex scene between Amber Heard and Channing or at least some sort of kissing was a waste. Their flirtatious relationship much like the film was lacking something more. I feel it was very much an unnecessary sequel but I can't say I wasn't entertained. It was hilarious and full of hot dudes but the raw and real edginess the first film had is gone. Reminds me of Pitch Perfect 2; one big letdown.,6,1,5,16 July 2015
Prisoners," Overrated
","First of all this film attempts to do what other films like The Deep End of the Ocean or Ransom or even the latest one Hallie Berry's The Call did. It even has a Mystic River vibe to it for sure however all those films were better. For starters the good; great cast no doubt about that and thank god finally Hugh Jackman IS NOT WOLVERINE! When you see an actor play the same character so much they might as well be on a TV series so it was nice to see him do something else.You got Terrence Howard, Viola Davis, Maria Bello and Paul Dano who's come so far since the silent older bro. in Little Miss Sunshine. I will add though that Hugh's performance didn't come close to Sean Penn in Mystic River. However the only one i had a problem with was Jake Gyllenhal. This was not one of his better performances and i didn't too much like his character.He reminded me of Brad Pitt in Seven; too headstrong, impatient and not that great a detective. Definitely could've had more of a detective Stabler (L&O SVU) type character (someone with kids). As far as the story goes it was a hot mess. I mean half the time we're following the detective around-not nearly enough parents POV to get the right emotion and then half the crap didn't make any sense with that creepy dude who offed himself.I really didn't think those scenes were that relevant and then the motives of the actual abductor didn't make sense but that doesn't matter cause half the crazy crap people do in real life doesn't make sense. I just felt this movie was built up too much when there's plenty of movies like it that were done better.",6,5,13,21 September 2013
Pitch Perfect 2," Hollywood loves pointless remakes AND sequels
","I hated this movie almost as soon as it started. Everything was just off. It tried way too hard to be funny forcing Rebel Wilson to have to act extra weird and quirky as opposed to just naturally weird and quirky. Becca's working at a lame recording studio while trying to tell the Bellas she's going to quit. There's like two or three new girls that I can't remember because they're not memorable.Then they go on this lame camping expedition where Audrey now works having graduated. The group of German singers they're going up against really suck and wouldn't even be hard to beat except that the Bellas suck too. Their end performance was crap especially compared to the first movie. Pitch Perfect was hilarious, charming, original, and had great performances. Pitch Perfect 2 was strained and pointless.",3,133,219,16 July 2015
What We Do in the Shadows," Love vampires? Then this will be hilarious to you
","First I have to say the trailer for this film was put together nicely. It really high-lighted some of the funny parts but definitely not all. I love vampires and I love vampire movies so it was easy to see them poking fun at other films like Nosferatu, Interview with the vampire, and of course The lost boys. This film is definitely in the spirit of such films as Shaun of the dead and Dylan Dog but these guys picked up on what seems to be a new style of filming; the documentary type style.I thought it worked really great for this film and even made it funnier. The three main actors were fantastic and perfect for their parts, Stuart was a bit of a side character and I thought maybe the actor playing him was too old. It seemed weird the young kid they turned into a vampire would be friends with him. Also I thought the actor that played the young kid was a little bland at times. Not as present and into the roles as the others were.My main complaint is I wasn't too crazy about the set. The house looked way too old which I know is what they were going for but it looked more like the run down house from Fight Club than a sophisticated vampire pad. To end on a good note this movie was unexpectedly laugh out loud funny to me and any other fan of vampire films.",8,0,2,27 July 2015
