Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," We waited for this!!!?
","What a piece of crap!!! I have never watched anything with such poor writing, directing and acting. I've never been so disappointed in my life or at least that's what I thought until I saw Episode 2. The only redeeming qualities of this garbage fire are the lightsaber duels, Qui Gonn Jin, Obi Wan and Palpatine. The Pod Race was ok but everything else sucked!!!",1,3,6,19 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Dumpster Fire!!!
","And I thought Menace was bad!!! Oh my GOD!!! What was Lucas thinking. Once again we are tortured with horrible writing, directing and acting!!! The so called love story was so painful to watch. How stupid are the Jedi? The prophecy says the chosen one will bring balance to the Force. They know of 2 Sith and how many Jedi are there? Do they even know what balance means!!!? I almost gave up on Star Wars after watching these God awful movies.",1,0,3,19 July 2019
