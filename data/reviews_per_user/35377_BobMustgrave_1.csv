The Blair Witch Project," I liked it better the first time I saw it when it was called The Last Broadcast
","I loved this movie....until I found out it ripped off The Last BroadcastFrom Wikipedia; The faux-documentary was made on a low budget and received a small initial release. It was only after the success of The Blair Witch Project in 1999 that The Last Broadcast gained much publicity, likely due to some similarities between the two films' plot lines.The makers of The Blair Witch Project admitted to seeing The Last Broadcast before making their film during a 1999 interview with Diane Sawyer. Avalos and Weiler have said in interviews that they only wish their film to be judged on its own merits.That's just rotten.",1,1,3,15 January 2009
