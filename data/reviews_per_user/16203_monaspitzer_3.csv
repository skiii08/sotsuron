Blade Runner 2049," Wow, what a masterpiece!
","I love Blade Runner 2049!
Everything fits!
The pictures that this film creates are incredible! The story makes sense from beginning to end, is somehow complex, but somehow not. The new figures fit perfectly into the Universe and everyone has a purpose and a place.
But the best thing about the movie is probably its message, but I do not want to spoil it;)
Can definitely compete with its predecessor!",9,3,10,18 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," This is not Star Wars!
","It makes me sad and angry to see what Rian Johnson did to the Star Wars universe.
J.J Abrahms has made a great, visually bombastic film. The figures have all harmoniously inserted and made you want more. We all wanted to know who Rey's parents are, where the Knights of Ren are and what the hell Luke has been doing all the time. Johnson ignored most of these questions (Knights of Ren) and if he answered one, I could have started crying. For example: Rey's parents were insignificant alcoholics, Luke had drunk green milk from a weird cow, and Snoke ... well ... he's dead now.
What really bothered me about the movie was its jokes. Of course, Star Wars is funny (droids, han, etc) but not to that extent and not so artificial.
Oh yes, there is something else: PORGS! I hate Porgs. These things are just there for little kids to buy and for Chewi to have 5 minutes more screentime. There is much more that bothers me about this movie (Rose, Holdo, ...), but I do not want to bore you with it :)
I really hope the next part gets better.
May the force be with you!",2,10,13,18 August 2018
Life Is Beautiful," Life's beautiful!
","Tas is not a criticism of this fantastic film, because there are already many here. I just want to say that people who criticize this film for making fun of the Holocaust and the Nazis do not understand it! this masterpiece is no comedy! It's a movie that gives you hope, that shows you how optimism can change your life! It shows you that even in one of the cruelest times of humanity nothing is lost!
if you have seen this movie you look different on this world!
So go and be like Guido, full of hope and optimism!",10,0,1,27 August 2018
