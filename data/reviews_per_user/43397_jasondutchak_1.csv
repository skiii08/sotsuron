Hereditary," Dissapointed to say the least
","Went into this movie hearing how it was the scariest movie in years. Definitely couldn't be farther from the truth. This movie should not be classified as a horror movie, it's more of a drama with some suspense. I was literally waiting and waiting for something scary to happen. The 'scary' parts were all shown on tv commercials building up the hype. There were a few tense moments at the very end of the movie but definitely nothing scary. I left the theatre very dissapointed I was really hoping to be scared Atleast a little bit.",3,3,6,16 June 2018
