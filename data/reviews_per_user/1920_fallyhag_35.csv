First Man," It felt genuine but left me bored
","The attempt to make it all feel dated and real worked well. There were no glossy space scenes. Add some interesting sounds and a lot of shakes can and the overal scene approach works. But then there is the story. We all know what happens. So it was just about the angle they approached it at. Unfortunately they picked the boring angle. The struggle with grieving was irritating. The lack of substance in the characters was disappointing. The frame was non existent. The length too long. The outcome underwhelming. The ending an anti climatic relief. I will remember this film for the dirty toilets, great acting and my repeated checking of my watch. If you want to learn a tiny bit then watch it. But it is sadly no masterpiece. Let down but the story telling...Recommend? Yes. On a Sunday...",6,541,797,14 October 2018
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Entertaining and well directed
","This movie appears to be the victim of the 'hate Twilight mob', which is a similar mob to the anti-X-Factor bunch (to which I belong) who will do and saying anything as long as it throws a negative view over it. The current IMDb of 4.0 (dated 19/11/11) is laughable and once again makes you question the credibility of the IMDb rating system. Anyway...I can understand why the Twihards like this but to be honest I thought the films leading up to this one were quite poor. Not very well made at all. OK to watch but not great examples of films as they should be. I have just watched Breaking Dawn Part 1 and I am happy to say that it is so much better. I am not a Twihard but I found this film well made, entertaining, enjoyable, pleasant on the eye and imaginative. OK OK, I don't want to exaggerate it, it is not Oscar material (apart from Bella's makeup), but it is a good film. I have rated it at 7.0 because I honestly believe that is what it truly deserves.Yes the story is nonsense, but come on, it is about vampires and werewolves. What do you honestly expect? But the director has done a very good job of translating the book to film (in my wires opinion). So let me break down my thoughts on it as I remember them....The film starts very fast. Slightly too fast. But I suppose there is a lot to cram in and before you know it we are into the wedding scene. The wedding is a good mixture of looking good, humour and drama. This flows into the honeymoon section where we were shown some lovely scenes. The romantic section was done very well and with taste. I personally thought the balance was just right here. Not too loaded with skin or uncomfortable holds etc..The honeymoon scene is where the main storyline is created. Everyone must know what happens here but I will not mention it. But the way it was introduced was good and the pace was just about right. This sections effectively puts Bella's makeup artist on the Oscar nominee list. Her gradual transformation is incredible. I assume it is all just makeup and lights...I couldn't see any clunky CGI. If it was CGI then they will no doubt get awards too. But the closing scenes with Bella have you seeing her in an amazing transformed state that simply makes the scenes what they are. Very impressed.The werewolves are considered the Marmite with this series of films. You either love or loathe the CGI. I have always accepted the CGI and bought into it and this film was no different. What I found better was the better direction and introduction of better mood music. The section on the log beach should have been stupid but I found it very powerful. More credit to the director. So what stood out that I didn't like? The lack of continuity in the whiteness of the faces kept grabbing my attention. Very minor though. The thing that I really didn't like was the CGI on the baby's face. It just appeared to be a little clumsy and obvious. But this was only for a nano-second so I may be judging harshly. But it could have been better.Rather than waffle on, I hate long reviews, I will sum it up. The film starts fast. The story represents the book very well. The direction is good and the makeup is excellent. The build up to the climax is well balanced and the film went very fast (despite its long running time). The way this film ends is spot on and does leave you wanting to know what happens next. I enjoy watching good films and I know what is rubbish when I see it. But I can safely recommend this film to you with the only caveat of 'remember what you are going to see' before you rush in and judge it harshly. I recall all the rubbish that has been pumped out this year and this is not part of that. This film entertains..as simple as that!ps: Don't leave when the scene closes at the end...there is more after the credits!!! So many walked out thinking it was finished...Doh!!!Hope you enjoy the film folks :)",5,4,11,19 November 2011
The Ring," If you liked being scared, well this one is for you!
","I watched this in the dark and late at night. I wish I hadnt.The makers did an excellent job of doing everything exactly the opposite of what you predicted. Just when you thought you had it sussed the story went the other way.I havent seen the original but I reckon this one was worth the effort.If you like suspense, story and twist then this is for you. Dont watch it on your own though! ...and to those who slag it down, maybe you better stick to your playstation and leave the adult movies alone. I have just watched 'The Ghost Ship' and read their IMDB reviews and was gobsmacked that some folks raved on about how good it was???? If you had the sense to recognise The Ghost Ship as rubbish then I reckon you will like The Ring.Recommended.Fallyhag",8,1,2,12 June 2003
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," A funny, romantic and intelligent movie
","This film has some very credible actors and acting in it. The light comedy will make you smile whilst the layered story will keep you entertained. I just stumbled across this film. I assume the advert campaign was limited. The film feels very under rated and quiet in the background. But this is genuinely a good film. It's a safe choice for a quick dose of 'cheer me up'. It is one of my most watched films but I can't exactly explain why. The editing, story, filming and acting are all top notch. Mixed in with intelligent comedy and storylines, this is a highly recommended watch from me. There are no explosions. No death shots. No terrorists or guns. This is just a good film that will make you feel happy :)",8,1,2,8 September 2018
Knives Out," Well acted, over-hyped and anti-climatic
","Film looks good. Great cast. Intriguing at the start. Humorous. Interesting feel. But then I got confused. Was it a comedy, a thriller? A whodunnit? Then the story got a bit slap stick. Then I got excited. I was waiting for the sucker punch. The intelligent twist. But it never came. The last act was like they run out of money and had to wrap up the filming fast. The story ending was dumbed down. The reasons laughable. The ending weak.This film had promise but failed to deliver. All the fake high review scores will high this though. It is a watchable Sunday afternoon film. That's all. An anti-climax.",6,8,14,26 December 2019
Terminator Salvation," How did the creator approve this mess?
","Its been a long time since I have seen a movie this bad. But I will start on what I liked. I liked the camera movement. The way the camera followed the momentum of the action was engaging. and I also liked....oh no, that was it.How on earth can the director resort to the Cliché Mad Max baron landscape and then end with the cliché factory scene? One minute the Terminators can hunt everything down and then the next you can make as much noise as you want.The characters are so forgettable. The story is such a non-starter it is breath-taking. i constantly struggled to see how the creator gave permission for them to take this route with the story. You could easily watch this and make no connection with the original storyline. The only way they get around this is with a dumbed down narration of what is happening and why.You constantly watch it questioning the rationale behind the story...which really makes no sense. At times I thought my DVD player had jumped coz the scenes were so badly stitched together. Then the scenes you do get are so cliché. the motorbike, the lorry chase, the venerable woman saved, the renegade group who don't want strangers, the pregnant other half, the kid that don't talk...blah...blah...blah... it really is nonsense.So if I disconnect it from the Terminator saga is it a good film...oh hell no. Lots of non-sensible action with a severe lack of story that an adult would understand. The Playstation Nation will like it because little thought is required but the Terminator lovers will hate it because it simply breaks the formula that has made it so great.Not recommended!",4,3,5,5 December 2009
The Day After Tomorrow," Routine FX, poor story and drab characters
","Loved the idea on the trailers and rushed to see it.The film starts off with the run of the mill build up, not even attempting to present a disaster with originality.The characters are never really related to and to be honest you dont really care what happens to them.The story has a poke at the US administration (Environmental selfishness) and has a long list of movie cliches. Not to mention the 'Glad to be an American' sickening ending.In summary, there are more negatives than positives and the FX certainly isnt ground breaking. I wont be rushing for the DVD on its release.5 out of 10.",5,0,1,3 June 2004
Horrible Bosses," Awful film with a corrupt IMDb rating
","I really cant believe the rating this film has. How on earth does this get a 7.1, higher than the latest Twilight Breaking Dawn Pt 1 film. Seriously!?I have watched some poor movies but this really is up there with the worst. Good actors, poor story, bland direction and terrible comedy timing. It is like a cheap impression of The Hangover but without anything worth watching. The storyline really is bad. I tried my best to remain interested but it is soooo slow. Then all the way through it constantly misses the comedy timing. When I say misses, I mean HUGE miss. To the point where you wonder if the director is qualified. Then there are the feeble attempts to try and be shocking but even this falls flat. It is all just so clumsy.I have rated this as a 4. The lowest I have ever rated a film I think. For this to carry a 7.1 just confirms to me that you cann no longer trust the IMDb rating anymore. There must just be too many Hollywood PR agents flooding this site with fake reviews. Pity.This film is not recommended.",4,9,19,24 November 2011
Shutter Island," Highly predictable and just plain boring
",Either I am very clever or this was rubbish. I had the so called twist sussed within 5 mins of the film starting. It was just so painfully obvious that it had me doubting whether I had it right or not. But sadly there was no clever story writing...it really was that obvious. Don't watch this and expect a Sixth Sense ending.The editing was awful and the scenes were choppy. This movie was a blooper fest...full of scenes that just didn't join together.This is probably the hardest review I have written on IMDb because the film bored me. I just didn't care about the ending. From the very start til the end I pretty much knew I had it figured out so I didn't really care about all the pointless scenes in-between.When the end finally came I was glad I didn't care because my intelligence had been assaulted by another 'Bobby waking up in the shower' ending mastered by the cult TV series 'Dallas'. All my watching was pointless because you were hit with a dumbed down ending that was partly explained by some poor dialogue.Some scenes were done OK (concentration camp) but some were just so green screen (rock climbing). If you are a fan of Cluedo then have a look at this but if you want a great film with a original ending then stay clear.As for the IMDb rating...another example of this website being managed by the film PR hype team. Never in a million years does this film deserve such a high rating. Probably the worst over inflated rating yet.Cant recommend...there are better things to spend your money on.,6,9,19,13 March 2010
American Hustle," Well filmed, well acted but it still bored me Zzzz
","All the performances in this film are very good. The actors all stand out and do their thing. Happy with that. The filming was interesting and I liked the way it was being directed. All good so far. However, at the end of it I was pretty under whelmed. It just came across as a little boring. The story was flat and predictable and the climax at the end was bland and unimaginative. For such a long film I was a little disappointed. My hope is that it will grow on me since the actors are all top notch..but I won't hold my breath. Best character for me: Jennifer Lawrence. Mad as a fish!Do I recommend it...yes...but don't expect too much...",8,8,15,3 January 2014
Léon: The Professional," I have just watched it again for the 100th time...
","There really is nothing I can say bad about this film. I have read the negative reviews in here and I am just left wondering how stupid these people must be. How do they not get it? Is it because there is too much emotion or connection with the characters or was the way it was expertly directed a problem? I always love a film that breaks the mould and gets away from cliché film scenes. I can remember watching this film years ago and I still love it as much today. The characters, the story and the whole damn way it is filmed.I 100% recommend this for anyone who loves a film that isn't saturated in Hollywood filth. This is a highly recommended masterpiece.",10,9,11,18 July 2009
The Matrix Revolutions," After watching that I can barely be bothered to comment!
","I loved the first one.I was dissapointed with the second.I was glad I didnt go to the cinema to watch the 3rd. Instead I waited til the DVD came out and my hunch was right, it was a real stinker.It started slow. It then went into lots of 'Oracle' waffle which I couldnt really care about. Then used lots of shoot em up action to try to get the 'Action' vote. Oh and then went for the cliche predictable ending.To come up with the idea in the first place I give them 10 out of 10. But I take the ten back for putting me through the other two terrible films.Next time W Brothers: Donate that incredible amount of money to a charity rather than waste it on a lame poorly thought out script.Rating for this one: 3/10",3,1,2,7 April 2004
Salt," Action packed with a simplistic storyline
","I like AJ doing the action role so I was always going to want to watch this. The trailer was good and encouraged me to do so.The film started well and got very gritty from the start. Promising. Sadly though, this is the point where I should have switched off my brain. The storyline is VERY simplistic and doesn't really care if it makes sense or not. The scenes jump from one action stunt to another but the bit that joins them together is really not there. If you leave your brain switched on then you will struggle to watch this. The laws of science and biology do not apply to this film and AJ seems to be made from Kevlar. Oh, and please please please don't watch this film believing that there are any great big twists because a three year old could work out the plot from the very start. The reveal just leaves you thinking...Derrrrrrrr!!!!!So to sum up; The story is nonsense, the action is full on but illogical, the characters are cliché and the ending is highly predictable and lazy. In my world this film is nonsense but in AJ's world this film is good for those who have trouble remembering to breathe. Its stupid but there is action in it. Just don't expected to come away from watching this feeling enlightened. I've rated this as a 6 just coz you can forget reality watching it. AJ will always get good marks from me so if you ever have a bored Sunday afternoon then maybe hire out the DVD. I just wouldn't recommend going to the cinema to watch it.",6,3,7,19 August 2010
Van Helsing," Lots of action, good effects....but...?
","Not too sure about this one. I think I enjoyed it.The effects were good and the action was non-stop. But the film started like it was a Gene Wilder spoof, and just carried on like it.I wasnt convinced with the Van Helsing choice of actor, but the lass was lovely and good to watch.Rather than go on and on I would summarize by saying that it is a film to watch as it does entertain. Definately not the worst of the year. The Matrix Pt 3 still has that title (DVD Release).Recommended. 6 out of 10

Pearl Harbor," A 3 Hr instruction video on how NOT to make a film
","First of all I would like to congrat you on a great Website, I have been using it for years and it has just got better by the day.Well now for the bad news....The film! I will try to keep it nice and short and to the point, not like the film director.I watched the trailer last year with my wife and we both agreed that this was going to be a really good film. After the hype and build up it eventually arrived. I was a little disapointed that it was aimed at being a love story but my wife was pretty chuffed.We paid our five pound fifty and we sat down ready to witness the marvel of the year. Little did I know that I would be sitting there for a good hour until the action started.The film starts with the traditional build up and get to know the characters etc... but this seemed to enjoy stretching the whole thing out. I could of accepted a love story as I always get my way with the choice of films so it was about time my wife got a treat and watched a great love story. The only problem is that the hour long intro was totally pathetic and unbelieveable. It is not often I catch myself staring at the ceiling waiting for a film to finish, and then to look over and see my wife doing the same. We both looked at each other and both wished that the film would just get on with it.Then came the part where the film title had a meaning ie 'Pearl Harbour', this was where the film remembered what it was about and got on with the story. To be honest you could of just arrived at this point and still felt like you had watched a complete movie.I then gripped my seat ready for a jaw drop, but it didnt! I wont say the effects were bad, in fact they were very good. My problem was that they were nothing new, there was no new ground breaking FX's being displayed here at all. Surely this was a perfect opportunity to display the next generation of FX's? I have unfortunately got very bored with the same old CGI FX's and I strongly welcome a good jaw drop, but not here I am afraid.Please dont get me wrong though, the attack was by far the best bit of the film and it was a pleasure to finally get to the point after an hour of watching paint dry.The planes attacked, the nurses helped the injured and the two heroes got into the air to 'save the day (ish)'. Oh, and I think Cuba Goddard Jnr was in the film too!? (What a waste of a talent)Well after being entertained at the attack something strange happened, I seemed to have blinked then magically moved to another cinema and found myself watching a sequel to the film 'Pearl Harbour'.Somehow after the attack, the film then decided to gloss around the reality of the event and just fast forward to the bit where the yanks try to revenge the attack. There was little aftermath, no lesson learning, very little mourning and no summary of what had just happened. The film just seemed to completely start up again where it should of finished and begin telling a completely different story. It was just incredible to witness this strange technique in film making.Well it ended with the Yanks having a little pointless go back at the japs before coming to a close. Naturally after all that had happened the film just had to finish with the cliche explanation commentry using a womans voice, very cheesy.In summary:1. Very stretched out love story that didnt work. 2. The Yanks getting a pasting by the Japs. 3. A very stretched and misplaced ending trying to make you feel like the Yanks did okay after all. 4. Very cheeseball and predictable end to the 'Love triangle'.My rating: 3/10 for the middle bit, nothing for the rest.Lesson learnt: Never waste such a great and memorable topic ever again. For half the price the story of Pearl Harbour could of been told more honestly, factually and with much much more feeling. Big bucks do not make a good film as shown here, but it is just such a pity that this chance was wasted. What I dont understand is that when all these movie business people sit around the table, well surely one of them must see that it is badly constructed, scripted and directed, but why is nothing said to stop them making this expensive mistake?Top tip: Save your money and go and see something else!",Null,0,0,3 June 2001
Yesterday," Another copy and paste storyline from Curtis.
","The characters are all well played and Lilly brings the pleasant sparkle. However, the story just goes from A to B relying on a few minor giggles without really trying to be creative or original. Yes it is entertaining. You will enjoy it. But a writer with so much experience cannot be allowed to keep getting away with such copy and paste nonsense. The story is entirely predictable and unoriginal. You watch and wait for something to take you by surprise but it just never comes. The character, the love interest, the conflict, the heartbreak, the reveal, the happy ending. So if you have a boring Sunday then this film is for you. You will laugh and smile. I recommend it as a film for fun but it isnt a keeper.",7,1,2,13 July 2019
Quantum of Solace," Good cast but VERY messy story. Not recommended.
","The cast, the action, the stunts and the scenery are all great...but the story simply does not make sense. From the very start I was trying to work out how each scene went into the other and was puzzled each time. The action is so thick and fast you almost want it to stop so you can get a grip of the reasons why he is doing what he is.The main woman is stunning but the one he gets in bed is so cliché and unexplainable...well yet again it just doesn't make sense. The evil villain unimportant and hardly really impacts in the story at all. His climatic end is very underwhelming but to be honest you don't really care enough.The baddies, the CIA, the MI6, the Bolivians, the police...OMG...too much. Just give me a damn story I can follow. Overall the story is flawed and made o so much harder by a clumsy, messy, illogical direction/edit.I cant recommend it coz it is just not James Bond as we know it. It's OK to break away from the old formula but it has to work, or it becomes a lemon like this one. Pity.Wait for the DVD.",7,2,3,8 November 2008
Kick-Ass," Funny, Violent and entertaining. Recommended.
",I waited for the iTunes download to watch it. and I loved it. It was like watching Kill Bill but with a 10 year old instead of Uma Thurman. Yep there is bad language and lots of violence. Who cares. The storyline moved along well and kept me entertained. The characters were all great and Hit Girl was a complete success. I have to recommend this film but just remember that despite the kids it has a lot of ass kicking in it. The ending was a little flat but that is compared to the good quality of the film as a whole. Looking forward to watching the sequel now :)I see that the Hit Girl actress is also staring in the great film 'Let me in'. I saw the Swedish version and it was brilliant. If she carries on like this then she has a bright future.,8,1,4,6 September 2010
The Hurt Locker," The only thing more stupid than this film is the artificially high IMDb rating
","I love a good war film and I fall into the 'been there, done that' category. So I would like to think my review is an accurate one (IMHO). Having just watched this film on DVD I can safely say that it was a pile of rubbish. There is no way I can recommend this film to you.It started off with me shouting at the TV saying 'you wouldn't do that' etc...but I soon realised that having a bit of job experience would be a hindrance so I chilled a bit. But on the opening scene when the trailer wheel fell off I got a nasty feeling that this film would be a predictable dud...I was right.There simply wasn't any logic to the EOD scenes. I just know that the army team had some of the most patient insurgents ever at the other end of the command wire or remote trigger. So much so I was left scratching my head all the time. Then just when you think you know where the story is going the guys in the Humvee are off out on their own driving around the desert. One of the most valuable assets in theatre out on a jolly bumping into some SAS wannabe contractors.The sniper scene was just so laughable. It just made no sense at all and made me want to switch off there and then. Then for them to drag it out so long really did test my patience.It started with the 'Contact Right' and went down hill fast. If you had a Brit accent then you got shot but if you were part of the EOD team then suddenly you were a great shot and saved the day. Then just as you thought it was over it stretched on for an inexplicably long period without adding anything to the story at all. You are just left watching and asking why hasn't it ended yet?Then we had the booze scene where they just hit each other for a laugh..another scene where you just wanted it to end. It added nothing to the film.Then just as my life seemed very dull the main star went outside the wire to hunt someone down. This most be the most ridiculous scene I have ever watched. It defied all logic and ability to write a good storyline...it was senseless and awful. I still don't understand why they wasted time on it. Then to watch him just jog through the busy streets heading back to camp had me rolling on the floor with laughter. Pure comedy :)The sad fact is that this storyline is all over the show without really deciding what it wants to be. I thought it was going to be stupid illogical EOD scenes but then it kept going off on tangents trying to be something different. But as hard as it tried it just bored me to death. All I wanted was for it to end. It was a messy compilation of stupid scenes mixed into a batch of stupid, senseless, action(ish) scenes.There is no way I can recommend this. Maybe my work experience compromised the enjoyability but even the naive must realise this just doesn't make sense. The only thing more stupid than this film is the artificially high IMDb rating...which must be the 24/7 work of the box office PR team who seem to use this website as a way of making everyone think it is good. Sorry folks...it just ain't!Not recommended...it will just bore you.",4,199,328,29 December 2009
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," I kept looking at my watch wanting it to end
","I am a big Star Wars fan (not including those three hideous ones) and I was really looking forwards to this one. However, I wasn't long into this film when I felt that something may not be quite right with it. The storyline felt very static and was reliant on cheap gags that made the film feel a little cheap.The visuals and sound were spot on. No complaints at all. The moment one ship light speeded into another had some memorable effects with a different look and feel to them. The problem is that this film doesn't really do anything. It just follows the rebels running away, a lot. Everything in-between felt a little pointless and the highly anticipated Luke scenes were very anti-climatic. In fact, I soon found Luke to be very annoying. That said, the make-up on all the characters were good but Lukes was especially good. It looked genuine. When the end finally came I was just so glad. I had been clock watching the last half hour as soon as I realised that the final act was going to be a dud. The way it was all wrapped up was non-sensical and the ending led you into a black hole. I have found myself not caring one little bit about the next film. For me this film was a HUGE disappointment. The story was really non-existent and the acting reverted back to that wooden type. I want to recommend it because it had a lot of visuals in but being a Star Wars fan I am struggling because it felt such a let down. All that waiting for nothing...pity :(",6,0,3,22 December 2017
The Dark Knight," Too long...I just wanted it to end
","Not a great Batman film fan because of the past films turning it into a dark farce, but I thought I would give this more serious one a go. At the start I quite enjoyed it. I like Bale and I liked the serious way of filming it where gravity did exist and the characters weren't capable of doing really stupid things, like Spiderman.But it wasn't long before the story got a bit daft. A lot was happening that just started to ignore common sense. The story line just started to go anywhere as long as it got to the next part of the story. You constantly find yourself watching thinking 'but that wouldn't happen'.... Yeah its Batman, but when the story gets silly just to meet the outcome...well I kinda gave up on it.The story was very...well...confusing. It kept jumping around trying to be all twisty and clever but it just made me feel aggravated. The scene jumping got madder and madder as time went on...and on...and on....I soon found myself busting for the toilet, which got me wondering how long have I been watching this film for? This film is so bloated it is ridiculous. I kept thinking this next build up was the end...but then it just carried on. There are so many false horizons in this film it is unbelievable. This was one of those VERY rare times when I just wanted the film to end...I was begging it to end.Hard to sum this one up, as all I wanted for it to do...was end. I stopped paying attention to the countless stupid attempts at a story twist...I just didn't care. From what I remember it was a shallow storyline that I just didn't buy into.Now for my real moan...the high rating this film has on IMDb....evidence of more ratings corruption on this website. You used to be able to trust these film ratings but it appears that the marketing departments know exactly how to exaggerate these figures...which I find very annoying. IMDb...do something about this or risk losing your loyal visitors to this once highly regarded website.Would I recommend this film....NO...too long and not worth the sore bum.",6,8,14,16 December 2008
Green Street Hooligans," I wanted to like this but it was awful...Not recommended.
","I quite like the ring hunting guy as an actor and I have heard a lot about this film so as soon as the DVD was for hire I got it.It starts off using a very worn out cliché of betrayal and then drops the character off in London to see his sister. Only two minutes in the country and he has achieved the impossible...he has got a ticket to a football game! The introduction to the family and the relationships was laughable. It was all so 'dumbed down' for a simpler audience. This wasn't helped by the constant references to 'Cockney Slang' which really did insult the intelligence. OK, so it is for a wider audience, but they must all think we are a right bunch of idiots over here.Then we were introduced to the youngest gang of thugs ever. The meet up was in the local pub where they were all shown getting on a huge binge before the match. Strangely enough though, you could hardly tell they had been drinking after it.Their behaviour in their own local pub...who are you kidding with all that chucking around of beer and standing on tables. Sh*tting on your own doorstep comes to mind - It doesn't happen!!! But I suppose this is the artistic licence part eh.I really didn't get the main plot of the film, which was probably because the 'moral of the story' script was being shoved down my throat like I was a 2 year old. The script was simply awful. Good thing happens, followed by a bad thing and then something dramatic and then the revenge at the end.The revenge at the end was a masterpiece of how not to end a film. it was 100% goosebumpingly cringeworthy. Very poorly thought out.Rather than waffle on I will simply say it is a very poorly written film with some good actors struggling to pull off a performance. I have no clue how this film is rated so high because it is really so awful and I am not that fussy. I like a good hooligan film but this wasn't one. Pity.Not recommended. Not even on DVD.",2,4,7,29 December 2005
Midsommar," Slow start, slow middle and slow end
",I switched this off after five mins but then changed my mind. Gave it a go. Some good actors. But kept feeling like I have watched this story before. As time went on it just followed the paint by numbers script. No real surprises. No intelligent twist. No shock ending. All rather predictable and a little dull.The film felt like it was never going to end. It was painfully slow. I didn't engage with any characters. I really couldn't care less about them. So as the story developed I was left emotionless. In the end I was just glad it finished.I did like the feel of it and the cinematography was pleasant. I believed the setting. But found the idea ridiculous.If you like slow placed indie films then give it a go but yikes. Have a good book or your iPad close by. Zzzzz... I would recommend it but I never particularly enjoyed it. But I wanted to.,5,1,2,29 October 2019
National Treasure," Another movie for the brain dead
","Now don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of this type of movie but I am really left wondering how the hell this story justified a big budget.There is nothing new here at all. The story is old and goes nowhere new and reality is constantly questioned throughout the movie.I like Cage & Kruger but this film was a total non-entity. I tend to rate my films nowdays by their ability to join my DVD collection. I am 100% sure this one will never. Pity.I was also left amazed at just how many times a bunch of strangers could wander about National Monuments without being challenged at all.Then to make matters worse, in came Harvey Kietel. No guesses as to what character he was playing...yep, a policeman!!! Oh what imagination...not.",4,0,1,8 May 2005
The Descent," This film makes you want to press Fast Forward
","This film starts off very well and gets you jumping early, but then after using a worn out cliché for a story starter it really does go down hill.It does well at the start in the caves and does make you feel uncomfortable and claustrophobic but these feelings are overpowered but all the thoughts going through your head questioning why they are in this situation. They are meant to be very clever and adventurous but make some very very basic errors in their planning & prep.I accepted the 'monsters' in the cave, but then I pitied them for being weaker than the women. They have probably been down there for years hunting but a bunch of town folk can kick their ass anyday...really? As for the ending...Nope, I just didn't get it. After enduring what seemed an age of darkness and wondering who was who I was really let down with a non-sensical ending.Not a completely bad movie but it did choose the wrong storyline and did run out of ideas when the action started.This film wont be joining my collection.",4,4,7,1 January 2006
The Matrix Reloaded," The disappointing films season has started
","I was really keen to see this film and rushed to the cinema.The story started VERY slowly.It then resembled a 'Mad Max' tribe thing going on in the Sion community.The fight scenes seem to go on for ages making you wish Keannu would finally understand that hitting them didnt work. After a while you realised that the scenes werent coming up with anything new. Very dull.The story was missing the mystery that made the first film a success. It seemed to go on for ages and ended 10 mins from the finish, or so it seemed.The motorway chases were okay but not groundbreaking. A little too much CGI possibly.In summary, the story was very slow and unoriginal. They were trying just too damn hard this time I think. If you like the 'XXX' kind of film then this is for you. Lots of shooting and fighting etc... If you like the sort of film that discovers a new way to present a film (The Matrix) then this one is not for you and you should wait for the DVD.Dont get me wrong, it aint that bad, but it aint wot I went to the cinema to see. Pity.",6,0,0,22 May 2003
War of the Worlds," I love Spielberg, but I didn't love this.
","As per usual, the hype and teaser trailers took me to the cinema.The film started fairly well and kept me watching, but as soon as those poorly designed machines appeared well I just knew something was going to disappoint. Once again Industrial Light & Magic have done overtime to create lots of unbelievable effects that ruin a film. If I wanted to watch an animation then I would go and see a cartoon for gods sake!!! Unfortunately the film adopts the cliché storyline of the father/son angst and does nothing to make it feel or look different. It constantly reminded me of the latest flop 'Day after tomorrow'. Cliché and worn out.There are a LOT of scenes in the movie that get you starting a sentence in 'But what about.....?' because they simply don't add up. An example, without giving away too much, is a crashed plane that has hurtled thru the sky at a vast rate of knots. After impact with the ground, the debris is all nicely contained in a former cul-de-sac and not spread over miles and miles. Convenient I suppose if you want to show it as an obvious plane wreckage.If you also like cellar scenes then this is the one for you. There is one that goes on and on, creating the same type of suspense twice in a row. Once again it didn't add up.The behaviour of the son, well I just didn't get that at all.What did I like though? Cruise and Fanning - always great to watch perform.The way humans were zapped - different.The river scene - spookyly eary.Summary. I was sat there in the cinema waiting for the film to finish. I hate this feeling, especially if I am watching a Spielberg movie, and I would struggle to recommend this film.Will I buy the DVD: NO - Huge pity, but I would never want to watch it again.",5,1,2,3 July 2005
Edge of Tomorrow," One of the best films of 2014 so far...
","I was on a downward trend with Tom Cruise so my real reason was to watch Emily Blunt. An English Rose :)The film doesn't hang about and gets straight into the story. Aliens and invasion etc...the normal thing. But the characters are enough to make you look through the cliché. But what really wins here is the subtle humour. The play with the Groundhog Day storyline and Emily's character. It just works.Okay so the story keeps resetting and they have to do things again. But the way it is told does make it interesting. It shouldn't be...but it is. I enjoyed the story flow and liked the characters. The action was fast and chaotic but it worked. I was left curious as to how they were going to resolve this. However, I kept having a niggle that I kinda knew how it might end. The reason I haven't given this a 10 is because it kinda fell flat for me as it got nearer the end. The trip to that Capital city was a little anti-climatic and rushed just to end the film. Or thats how it felt. Then the ending was a little unimaginative. But I wasn't left disappointed or annoyed. The film was good. One of the best I have seen this year...but it could have been better...near the end. I would certainly recommend this. Its an action film with some feeling and some good humour. It is a good film. Hope you enjoy :)",9,1,3,8 June 2014
12 Strong," Great actors in a TV movie
","There is no doubt that this is a good cast. If the story is true then I respect all involved. The down side is that the script, cinematography and direction was all very amateurish. It felt like a TV movie. I knew there was going to be a problem when one of the actors was asked to say 'target rich environment'. Cringe city. Very lazy writing. The film is very dumbed down and the scenes clonk together. The action is dull and the scenes are messy and confusing. The logic is baffling and the tension is non-existent. After lots of pathetic non effective bombing runs you are left with a messy poorly filmed climax. Then it feels like they were late for a train and it ends. The current high rating for this film is artificial and false. I gave it a 5 because there is nothing engaging or entertaining. This film is not recommended.",5,0,4,4 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," 3 Very Good films and 3 Average films
","I have just got back and I am left confused.This film was far from 'redeeming' Lucas. Before he made this he should have been banned from using Digital effects. Once again he has overdosed on lovely scenery and over-complicated action scenes.The film moves so slowly at the start and drags along until the end when it suddenly speeds up and tries to join up all the dots.I personally left the cinema very disappointed. It is nowhere near the original films despite spending millions on needless effects. As for the story, well it is very predictable and makes little impact. The film wastes the 'moment' where all the other characters are brought into the story.As a huge Star Wars fan I am now questioning whether I will buy this last DVD since it has very little to encourage me to watch it time and time again.You have to go and see it because that is the way they have designed the whole thing, but when you go just don't expect too much.Verdict: Too much effort into effects and VERY little thought into the story and direction. 5/10",5,1,2,19 May 2005
The Queen," Balanced and well acted - Recommended
","Was very keen to see this film, especially because of the Diana connection. It started off quick and got straight to the point.The thing I liked about the film was the balance. Just when I thought it was being biased it clicked back in and showed the other side. In fact the only one to come off looking like a git was Phil the Greek, the Queens hubby.The PM and the Queen were acted very well and must be rewarded with professional acknowledgement. Charles however was a little miscast and understated.The historical clicks and drama had women in the cinema crying so it was good to see that Diana still has it in her to tug at the heart strings.Not a Hollywood blockbuster but just a nice film, which makes a nice change in this era of CGI and poor scripts.Recommended.",7,11,20,16 September 2006
Pitch Perfect 3," An improvement on the 2nd one
","I wasn't expecting too much so I went to the cinema with an open mind. However, I was only about 3 minutes into this film and I could feel the quality and feel of it was a whole lot better than the last. There should not be any confusion about what this film is. Lots of cheap laughs and a little feel good music. Thats it. But that is all it has ever been. So the measure is how good it makes you feel.The story, whilst very predictable and normal, did flow okay and the pace was good. There didn't feel like there was that much singing in this one but it was enough for me. All the pitches looked great and the visuals were all done well. I've not heard of this director before but I liked her work. The humour and 'action' were all well executed and I had a good few giggles throughout. I was expecting a bigger ending with more of a punch but it never quite came. It was okay but I expected a big hitting finale. Overall I came away a little happier having had the chance to laugh at a few cheap gags. It is what it is and it made me laugh. So I have to be positive about this film. It was a lot better than I expected. I do recommend you go and see it.",7,39,85,22 December 2017
Live Free or Die Hard," Hollywood dumbing down again
","Are we all meant to accept this new culture of writing completely unbelievable stories? Is it now not acceptable to expect a film that has a storyline for those without popcorn for brains? OK. If you want an action film with lots of shooting, chases, computer cheating and senseless story lines then this is a great film for you.But if you expect things to make sense and the characters actions to have the slightest evidence of common sense then keep clear of this film. I wont add spoilers but scene after scene just makes no sense. There is NEVER any logic behind what they do next. It got that bad I just felt like switching it off.There is NOTHING new in this film and once again CGI effects rule the action parts. The main storyline is cliché and worn out and the big baddie does nothing for the role at all. There are so many cliché scenes in this film that I don't know where to start.If you do have popcorn for brains then enjoy...but if you like t watch a good film then stay away from this Hollywood tripe.",5,4,9,6 July 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A LOVELY PRESENT, BUT TOOK A WHILE TO UPWRAP IT
","1st film: Enjoyed 2nd film: Was ok 3rd film: Much betterThe film started off really well with a great insight into one of the characters dark past, which did make the little kid next to me squirm a little.This film does manage to provide a little bit of everything of everyones film tastes. It has humour, action and some girlie luv stuff.The one thing that did 'kinda ruin' it for me was the prolonged ending. I thought I was the only one whose bum was aching for the last scene but a couple next to me had the same sigh of relief when it finally came. Not wanting to spoil it for you but just when the film seems to come to a natural end....well it just keeps going....and going......etc...In summary, well worth the visit to the cinema! Little scary in places for the young ones so watch the parental age recommendation.Eight out of Ten!PS: The special effects: Outstanding!!! Second to none.",8,0,0,18 December 2003
Braveheart," Always enjoy the first hour but struggle to concentrate all the way through...
","No point waffling. The film has been around for a while and everyone knows it is a goodun. Just watching it again and apart from the dodgy accents it is made well and starts off getting you involved. I buy into the characters each time.The change to an angry Gibson is justified, powerful and effective. The fight scenes are good and highly watchable. The more you watch it the more you spot the other stars in it. Just about every other actor is a highly rated one. But it does go on a bit...a bit too long for keeping me involved. Everyone recommends this film and so do I. But be patient with it...",7,1,4,7 September 2008
