Blade Runner 2049," Terrible is the only word
","Terrible plot
Like something you've already seen lots of times. Boring, predictable, no true message. Too many plot holes. Simple and stupid plot. Showing clips from previous movie??? Come on...Terrible dialogs
Dialogs for retarded. Terrible acting
By all. Choice of main actor terrible. Like trying to copy Keanu Reeves, badly. Jared Leto and Ryan Gosling look like underfed teenagers. Totally not up to the task, unless the movie is targeting retarded teenagers from... wherever...Terrible influence on people's minds. I want to shot myself now, how bad this is. No depth, no intelligence, no message, no nothing... Only one thing is there - paid votes and reviews on IMDB.",1,4,9,31 December 2017
