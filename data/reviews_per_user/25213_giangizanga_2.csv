Blade Runner 2049," Interesting concept, interesting Story, boring development
","I saw the movie without seeing the original Blade Runner (I fell asleep when I tried)
I have to say that it starts in a very good way, it has a good writing, good character and a strong subject... But....
At least half of the movie is soooo slow... The movie narrating is blowing in some sequences... But very very boring in other...
It's a shame... It could have been much better than this..

Joker," Awesome, but not the BEST movie evere
","Todd Phillips' Joker Is a great movie, with a perfect performance and Amazing directing and cinematography, the character Is Absolutely fabolous...
But...
This cannot be Called the best movie ever.. in some points Is a bit slow, and the story Isn't Fair enough to make this a masterpiece",9,1,7,4 October 2019
