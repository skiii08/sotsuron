Moneyball," Chix Chat on Film review: Moneyball, the mathematics of baseball.
","There have been so many films dedicated to Baseball that they are too numerous to count, but this has to be the first that I have ever seen that was based on the mathematics of the game. I tend to get a little bit bored with stories that are based on true events and I did yawn at one point during this film, but overall it was such a fresh take on how desperate times call for desperate measures that I quickly perked up. Watching the on screen wheeling and dealings of Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) as the Oakland A's general manager was very educational if not a bit disconcerting. The players are basically treated like livestock, which just made me a little sad. Jonah Hill (Peter Brand) consistently proves himself as an amazing actor, it doesn't matter if it is comedy, drama or animation he just transforms. I have repeatedly watched Megamind with my grandson recently, so immediately I thought of Metroman and Titan together again! I place this film right up there with the timeless A League of Their Own since it is based on true events. This was one of the best baseball stories that I have seen played out. The human element of this story with the autobiographical content of who Billy Beane is was interesting and entertaining. I couldn't help but to relate to Billy Beane, as I too made a decision based on money and opted to enter the workforce directly out of High School rather than entering college, the decision played out well for him and I have to admit that for me I have no complaints. The relationship with Billy and his daughter Casey (Kerris Dorsey) was so heartwarming that it was obvious what or better yet who motivated his future decisions, but aside from that it seemed that all other elements of his life were centered around baseball, that aspect of his existence I could not relate to at all. I did have a lot of respect for Billy in how he dealt with Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman), I just don't know if I could have been so patient. You cannot institute a paradigm change without having your core team (no pun intended) on-board. I caught this film on the same day that my very own Texas Rangers won the AL West Division, so in my opinion this was an awesome day for baseball, I have to give it a green light. - Emma Dinkins",Null,1,2,25 September 2011
The Avengers," Chix Chat on Film Review: Avengers take control.
","The Avengers is the story of some of Marvel's well known super heroes that band together in a joint effort to save the world. We know from Men in Black that the world is always in need of saving, so I will take a term from that film and say that this is 'the best, of the best, of the best'! This film has some first rate, spectacular, out of this world and any other term that I can think of to convey how good the special effects, the performances, the casting, the direction and everything else in it is. I did see it in 3-D which was totally worth the added premium. If I were wearing a hat I'd give Joss Whedon (director, writer) a hats off for delivering this action packed extravaganza. The story has very clever dialog in that, the characters are able to convey exactly what the audience needs to know without it seeming as though we are auditing a Super Hero 101 lecture. Although this is what I will call a compilation sequel, it was fresh and original and could have easily stood on its own had we not been given all of the prior introduction movies. Not that I'm complaining about any of them Iron Man Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) was successfully arrogant and enduring at the same time. His and Hulk Bruce Banner's (Mark Ruffalo) intellectual bonding was intriguing enough that I'm hoping for an Iron Man featuring Hulk follow up film. The Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) sibling rivalry could render countless sequels and was front and center in this story, but I will expect to see Heimdall (Idris Elba) in any subsequent stories or no deal. My only issue with the set up films is that there was only the small side story featuring Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) in Iron Man. I kept hearing James Brown in my head singing 'This Is a Man's World', but from where I sat it wouldn't be nothing without a woman or a hulk, I mean a girl. Natasha Romanoff held her own in this boys fight club and riding on the success of this film could easily carry a Black Widow film. I know, I know historically the female super hero lead doesn't fare well at the box office, but I blame the vehicle not the passenger. Ever since the Incredibles I have these smiling moments when the bad guys start monologuing, Hulk has the best response to it I've seen to this day. I give this film a hulking green light.",10,2,6,6 May 2012
Men in Black 3," Chix Chat on Film Review: MIB back to the future.
","Men In Black 3 takes us on a journey into the past that was very enlightening because you recognize that you are given answers to questions that you did not realize you had asked. It turns out that we witness a fourteen year partnership has transpired between Agent J (Will Smith) and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) that brings about the realization that the first MIB was fifteen years ago! We see that some of the original favorite characters real or otherwise like the worms are still around and others real or otherwise have moved on. The series has always had great villains whose endeavors will bring about the destruction of the planet, and the only reason we can continue in our daily lives is that we don't know about it. Thank you Men In Black for keeping me safe in my naiveté. This time around our villain is Boris The Animal (Jermaine Clement) who prefers plain Boris, who is over the top mean. It took me a moment to recognize who he is and then I thought Flight of the Conchords and Dinner For Schmucks, the make-up was done very well and I should also mention the special effects. Boris had an interaction moment that took me back to Time Cop, but I won't get into that since I don't want to give anything away. We know from the trailer that Agent J travels into the past to save the future and this adventure allows him to interact with a younger Agent K played by Josh Brolin. It was truly amazing how well he channeled the Agent K persona, if I didn't know that they were two different people it would have been hard trying to convince me that it wasn't actually a younger Tommy Lee Jones. The story has a lot of interesting dynamics taking place in the past all centered around Agent K and some surprising connections, the Agent K and Boris history is where the plot thickens. There were so many funny moments in this film and as with its predecessors there is a pulling at the heart strings moment. As always the special effects give these films such a realistic feel. I'm still impressed by how young Will smith still looks and how old Tommy Lee Jones looks. I hope that since the MIB helm is now in the hands of Agent O (Emma Thompson) that this won't be the final installment. The film gets a green light from me.",8,1,3,29 May 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Chix Chat on Film review: The honeymoon is over.
","I was immediately impressed by the look of this film, all the location shots were simply beautiful to behold from the wedding to the aerial view of Rio de Janeiro to Isle Esme. The special effects were so believable that I shuddered at the ferocity of the wolves and the rapidly diminishing health of Bella (Kristen Stewart), she really looked a hot mess. I had an expectation from the trailer that the film would be more action driven, but it was primarily a love story at least until the honeymoon was over with a wedding night pregnancy. At that point of course everything was all about protecting Bella, oh wait that's been the constant theme in the entire series. I have really grown tired of Jacob (Taylor Lautner) pining away for her. Dude get over it, it's never gonna happen! I know the stories correlate very closely to the books so there's nothing he can do about it, but I'm just saying. Maybe someone should show him the end of New Moon when she tells him it's Edward (Robert Pattinson), it's always been Edward, it's always gonna be Edward. The whole story with Jacob standing up to the pack was worthwhile, it showed that being in love with Bella hasn't completely emasculated him, although he pretty much did that for her too. I'm tickled each time I watch these films that Jasper (Jackson Rathbone) typically has one word dialogue, and basically just maintains that odd look of despair. I still don't understand how Charlie (Billy Burke) could live in Forks all this time and not figure out that there are Vampires and Werewolves and Bella figured it out within months of moving there. I actually did like this film, but I don't feel as if I would have missed very much had I just waited until Part Two when everything all comes together with the Volturi confrontation. I know from my family members who read all the books and are ultimately and completely infatuated with the stories that they left from seeing the movie satisfied. I left wanting more which I am sure was the whole point of breaking the final story into two parts. For anyone unfamiliar with the series and the books, this is not a must see film, because none of it would make sense if you just went to see a movie and checked this one out, but if you are familiar it was entertaining enough for me to give it an amber light.",Null,2,8,21 November 2011
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Chix Chat on Film Review: Not your typical teenage angst tale.
","The Perksas it were, was a bit of a marvel when discussing what teenagers have to contend with. Anyone that decides to see this film expecting a run of the mill high school drama or teenage angst tale will be pleasantly surprised at the depth with which this story delves. This adaptation of Stephen Chbosky's novel seemed to take the difficulties facing one young man embarking on his high school journey through one extreme situation after another. I could visualize a totally different version of this tale of misfit toys being played out where all is right with the world and Charlie (Logan Lerman) is the most popular freshman in school for the simple fact that all his friends are seniors. The immediate infatuation that Charlie had with Sam (Emma Watson) was no surprise, what did surprise me was the challenges that she and her step brother Patrick/Nothing (Ezra Miller) had to endure. Even I started to get annoyed as the school year progressed and the running 'Nothing' joke persisted. It's always surprising when a story focuses on well to do young people whose lives would be expected to mimic a fairytale. This story gives insight into the fact that some young people have the same if not even more struggles than others and having money can't really fix that. I found it interesting that there was no clear indication in the story as to the school year, even at graduation there was none of the typical 'Class of '92' or whatever to show how proud of their time graduates are. It may be that Mr. Chbosky wanted to steer clear of associating the story with a specific year, but it was obviously the early 90's when the primary mode of sharing and exchanging music was via cassette. I recall so very clearly the good old days when the 'mix tape' ruled. I have to say that I liked Emma Watson as an American teenager, she can cross the pond and put it down any time. Yes there were a few moments in her dialog that she sounded like Hermione, but this role did a great deal to paint her in a different and mature light. I am not drawn to tales of the human condition unless there is a deep truth to be gleaned from the story, so if I had to say the moral of the story is It would be 'you gotta have friends'. This story worked because of what the three key characters gained from getting to know each other. I give it a green light.",8,102,143,31 August 2012
Skyfall," Chix Chat on Film Review: A more profound Bond.
","Although the opening scene blast with two notes from the Bond song caused me to laugh, this story is no laughing matter. James Bond (Daniel Craig) bursts onto the scene in his full testosterone driven swagger, making everyone believe that he is the epitome of masculinity and is absolutely unstoppable. In this film there was a consistent theme of opposition throughout the story, youth versus experience, good versus bad, old versus new, lies versus truth and, technology versus conventional. I was very satisfied with the conventional stunts and was glad to see some actual calamities rather than the now standard CGI and/or green screen, this film did a good job of making the stunts look effortless, but I know they were not. I cringed at the sight of some of the nice automobiles that were demolished for the sake of art and whenever I see on screen images of Singapore especially at night I am in awe, and just want to get the next flight out and see this phenomenal city. Up until now my favorite 007 had been Pierce Brosnan, he was the Bond that I best recognized, but what Mr. Craig has proved here in this and the prior Bond films in which he starred is that he has the acting chops to make this role his own. This time around we are introduced to some new pivotal players in the Bond chronicles and a new Bond nemesis, Silva (Javier Bardem) who is revealed from the trailer, fortunately the trailer does not give away all the good stuff that this film is choked full of. The unique structure of Mr. Bardem's face makes him a credible sociopath, but I'm glad to have seen his softer side in Eat Pray Love, otherwise I would just shudder every time I see him on screen. The special effects used when he reveals himself were nothing less than astonishing, frightening but truly astonishing. The other NKOTB introduced in this latest Bond installment who I hope to see more of in the future, that stood out the most were Eve (Naomie Harris) and Q (Ben Whishaw). It was nice refreshing having a youthful rather than Methuselah type Q. This film had drama, seduction, action and adventure, all the things that have made be grow to love this character and these stories. I anxiously await the next Bond episode, and I give Skyfall a green light.",8,2,10,16 November 2012
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Chix Chat on Film Review: Abraham Lincoln's other job.
","This film was not my first choice out of all that premiered this weekend, however it was my husband Mike's birthday weekend so the choice was his. Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter (Benjamin Walker) is the story of the 16th president of the United States extracurricular activities of preparing to become an attorney and slaying vampires. The first as the result of brutality he witnesses as a child against Will Johnson (Anthony Mackie) his friend, and the latter spurred by the death of his mother the victim of a vampire as seen in the trailer. I was a bit apprehensive about seeing this film and felt that it would be a major slight to the president who dared to unite the union by abolishing slavery. But I will admit that it was interesting how the vampire tale was woven into history. I am growing weary of vampire stories and I had to revise my way of thinking about the integration into the life of a man that was instrumental in making my quality of life possible. I realized that this telling was really not that different from Forrest Gump teaching Elvis to wiggle his hips or the discovery that Transformers were the catalyst for the Apollo space program. The story begins with a narration from Abraham to his lifelong friend Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper), who I found to be the most intriguing character of those featured primarily because his conflicts of conscience were the most compelling. I would say that this film is the first time that I have seen Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Mary Todd Lincoln) portray an adult character, she is typically a teen or early twenty-something but she came across very convincingly as the First Lady. I mentioned Anthony Mackie was in this film, bottom line if he's in the film I'm with it. I saw the film in 3D, but I honestly do not feel that the premium for 3-D is necessary for this film. The special effects were pretty cool especially the stampeding horse scene, however I just don't think anything would have been lost had I viewed the regular HD version of the film. There were a few moments that the computer generated imagery was just too obvious like the aerial view of Gettysburg, and other moments that were so far-fetched that it was hard to refrain from uttering an audible 'seriously' like the flaming bridge train scene. But overall it was entertaining enough that I give it an amber light",7,4,8,24 June 2012
The Maze Runner," Chix Chat on Film review: aMAZEing Adventure
","The future of the teen to twenties continues to have a consistent tone in science fiction and fantasy. Either grow up and be responsible or die! I know that is a bit harsh but The Maze Runner and others like the Hunger Games paints a bleak picture in general in which the adults in charge build a world in which the only objective for its youth is survival. The star of this thrill 'run', Dylan O'Brien (Thomas) has been on my radar for the past few years as I must admit Teen Wolf is one of my television viewing guilty pleasures. The past few seasons he has emerged as an amazing talent and really showcased his emotional range when possessed by the Nogitsune in season 3. He is quite convincing in this role. I knew I would see this film but hadn't decided upon IMAX until the day of, and I have to say it was worth it to experience it in the biggest and boldest format for a feature film. As someone who had not read the book, I came in with no preconceived notions about the fundamentals, like WTF a giant maze, really!?! Yes, the trailer does give an indication that it is a test of some sort, but still. So I was contemplating how long would it take for the story to divulge what's behind it all, but I wasn't bored nor was I left feeling neglected by being unfamiliar. The mystery of what was taking place was part of my fascination with this film, working things out along with Thomas. My excitement continued to ebb as I ventured into the maze with him and Minho (Ki Hong Lee) as did my trepidation. This was a good movie, not saying it was great, but I enjoyed it for its entertainment value. I'm usually big on the special effects which has a significant baring on whether I see a film on the big screen or wait for it to come to video, but in this case the effects were not the star, the actors were, which is how it should be done.",Null,0,1,21 September 2014
This Is the End," Chix Chat on Film: Funny as hell
","This is the end of the way I view a film as a comedy. I experienced some of the funniest and some of the most disturbing situations imaginable in this film that played out one possibility in biblical proportion of how the world would end. The fact that everyone used their own names made the story have a realism about it that even further played into the comedy. I don't typically associate special effects with a comedy, but this film had some pretty good effects going on with the hell mouth sized sink holes, the rapture and the devil-dog. I was rather impressed that they weren't SyFy channel fodder, which is typically hard to swallow. The majority of the jokes were potty humor and there were an excessive number of phallus symbols, skeet and penetration innuendo, but the raunchy jokes won laughs even though some came with a bit of a grimace because it is somewhat embarrassing to admit. Who would have imaged the apocalypse as a situation comedy? Obviously Seth Rogen, who is the co-writer and co-director, he played the story straight and even takes a jab at his own acting prowess. There were quite a few talented entertainers in this story and many of them also played into the areas that have characterized their presence in Hollywood. Michael Cera comes across as this out of control drug abusing, womanizing whiner, which is the antithesis of every role that I have ever seen him portray. And the slap that Rihanna placed on him for his inappropriate behavior simply cracked me up. In all honesty, I know that the situation with Danny McBride was making fun of Magic Mike, but Channing Tatum was just done wrong. Good thing that he is obviously secure in his manhood, but he did use his actual name. This film was just plain funny, and one scene that made me laugh out loud, that I don't think others in the theater quite understood was when the elderly lady responded as to why she had placed a sign in her establishment. I could hear that I was the last person to stop laughing at that bit. Who would have thought that you could leave an apocalyptic film, feeling good at the end? Obviously Seth Rogen, the musical ending had me moving in my seat with a smile on my face, which was just the icing on the cake. I give it a green light.",8,5,18,16 June 2013
World War Z," Chix Cat on File review: Aggressive zombie infestation
","The trailer made World War Z look like the zombie population had gone extreme, with them developing the new talent of running. What an unfair advantage now in their favor considering the lumbering gait was the only thing that provided some level of protection for the human race. This year has been evolutionary for the zombie, since we now also know from Warm Bodies that there's even zombie love. There is some consistency in what has been the recent approach to zombification, it starts with some fatal contagion, not like the good old days when a vampire enslaves a human which keeps the numbers low, or a voodoo casting or the result of some improperly contained hazardous chemical, now everything is a virus run rampant. Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) is a United Nations employee and is reactivated to track down the invading agent and try to figure out how to stop it. I don't know what UN employees do and after this film I still don't. There was a segment where Gerry is sent to accompany mankind's best hope for finding a cure and I'm not sure if he was supposed to be some level of protection but the situation just got direr rather than better. My favorite aspect about the story aside from Mr. Pitt of course is what puts the human race at its greatest disadvantage, the speed of the zombies. The special effects that allowed for them to climb atop each other and perform record breaking tackles added to the intensity. Although the movement and feel seemed very similar to the creations from I Am Legend, it was still rather chilling to watch as the human race was quickly being annihilated. My biggest complaint about the story is that I left the theater with no greater insight into what was the intrusive culprit than I had already gathered from the previously mentioned trailer that it's a contaminating virus with unknown origins and is aggressively spreading. I did not find this story particularly scary but it did pass my 3-D test, yes I flinched, actually a few times. I just kept thinking keep that guy Gerry away, because it just seemed that wherever he was the zombie infestation grew. That may not have been the reality since the problem was supposedly worldwide, but as good as Mr. Pitt looked as 'every man', he was bad luck for everybody except himself. I liked the film, but felt as if too much was given away in the trailer, therefore I give it an amber light.",7,2,5,30 June 2013
The Hunger Games," Chix Chat on Film review: Survival of the fittest.
","The excitement surrounding the premiere of this movie was a little unexpected for me because when I read the book I thought that the story was a good one, but not so much as to throw me into a frenzied state with anticipation to see the film. It seemed to me that a huge investment was made in the assumption that the audience that would see The Hunger Games movie were familiar with the book series and were knowledgeable fans, and I think that if that were not the case you would not understand some of the images like Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) in the rain and the loaf of bread encounter with Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). The film did in fact do a good job of making the whole dynamic of their relationship clear, although it did not make it so clear the nature of Katniss' relationship with Gale (Liam Hemsworth). I was really interested in how the final battle would appear, since much of what was discussed in the story specifically relative to the train, the capital and the final battle would be difficult to showcase without very strong special effects. The special effects in this film were nicely done, but the final battle was not as intense as I had imaged it would be. However a pleasant surprise was witnessing the control room as the games unfolded, which was a nice touch. The costuming of the citizens was useful in making it known that the flavor of the Capital City is eccentricity, which is somewhat made clear from the trailer with the over the top appearance of Effie Trinkit (Elizabeth Banks) and Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci). The film made the presence of President Snow (Donald Sutherland) more accessible so that you get a feel for the type of person that he is, no warm and fuzzy from this character. I liked the film, but more so because of my having read the book, I don't feel as though I would have been as understanding of the running time and the lulls in the action sequences, otherwise. It's not possible to unread a book and have that fresh unbiased perspective but aside from the strong performances of the actors and the special effects I would have found the film to be sluggish and I didn't really get emotionally invested until actually experiencing the Katniss interaction with Rue (Amandla Stenberg). For the most part the film was very true to the book, but if you don't know the book, you will be left out in the cold on this one, I give it an amber light.",7,0,7,24 March 2012
42," Chix Chat on Film review: Jackie Robinson super human
","The opening disclaimer in any movie that states it is 'based' on true events makes me question how much creative license was taken in crafting the story. I believe that 42, which is the story of Jackie Robinson's (Chadwick Boseman) journey through breaking the color barrier in American baseball took much of its creative license in toning down the racism that Mr. Robinson must have faced. This story was told with so much heart and sensitivity that I didn't leave angered by the large scale intolerance that was pervasive at that time in our history but feeling proud that this man who was once a fatherless child could make such an impact on my history. This wasn't just the story of how Mr. Robinson's talent played a part in bringing about tolerance in baseball but also told the tale of how instrumental Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) was in making this moment in time take place. The fact that there was a scene in which Mr. Rickey speaks on his motivation just makes the tale all the more endearing. I know that the story is based on true events but not all true stories are engaging. His character and strength were portrayed with clarity and conviction by Mr. Ford, I am forever and always a Han Solo fan. This is a story that needed to be told for someone like me who had heard about Jackie Robinson but had not given a great deal of thought to the depth of his triumph. He was before my time, in fact when the story takes off my mother was only six. This is the type of film that makes everyone feel a little better when exiting the theater and the pre credits statements that informed the audience of where some key character's lives carried them was a testament to who was on the right or wrong side of history. The film did a phenomenal job of recreating the era from the location shots, to the automobiles and the attire, everything and everyone looked authentic. I barely noticed the 2 plus hours running time because this story was so very entertaining. The only time that I felt really uncomfortable was when Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk) taunted Jackie during a game which was much like the chorus of the Trinidad James song All Gold Everything, which also makes me uncomfortable. This film gets a glaring green light.",Null,1,3,13 April 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Chix Chat on Film review: Keep on Trekking baby
","This second film in the reimagined Star Trek movie franchise has everything that a Trekker could ever want and more. For someone like me who grew up with the original television series and then went where no (wo)man has gone before with the feature films, I never expected that the stories would evolve into something with such 'wow' factor as J.J. Abrams and team have crafted. Once again my assertion that Mr. Abrams is my favorite and the best contemporary director has been proved to be well deserved. But he obviously has a deep insight into how to translate the dialogue from Orci and Denioff into a spectacular vision. This film has the perfect mix of action, adventure, comedy, romance, drama, and suspense. To balance out all of the emotions that were experienced in this story and create a film with an engaging plot and stunning visuals is a major feat. I was surprised to learn who the primary antagonist was, and the manner in which the story was woven around him made the story even more intriguing. I was thrilled that Uhura (Zoe Saldana) had an opportunity to really showcase her linguistics and as Catt said, it was time the Klingon's came into the picture. I've been a bit tainted when it comes to away missions because of Galaxy Quest I always consider crewman six's inevitable doom. Prior to now I did not feel as if the scale of the Enterprise or the hardware like the warp core were appropriately conveyed. Seeing the scale of engineering and the other areas of the enterprise left me awe stricken, because after all, the ship is as much a star of the franchise as the characters. My only complaint with this film was the scoring, in some of the sequences the theme music was just too over the top and made me feel like I needed to find the volume knob so that I could turn it down and refocus on the film. I get it that the music gets louder so the audience recognizes how intense the situation is, but that little trick wasn't necessary since the action scenes were full throttle and none of the excitement would have been lost if the music had been at a moderate tone. I have anxiously waited four years for this film and was utterly thrilled with the end result. I give it a green light",10,10,24,19 May 2013
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Chix Chat on Film review: A man attempts to reconcile his life after his wife asks for a divorce.
","I am always in favor of a good comedic family drama and thought that this one looked as good as any. I was also interested in this story because it struck an accord with someone such as I, who has been married for more than two decades, and begs the question where can it go wrong? Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) has reached a comfortable complacent point in his life when he is then blindsided by his wife Emily (Julianne Moore), as seen in the trailer, with her declaration of wanting a divorce and her confession of a transgression. I have seen Despicable Me so many times now with my grandson Three, that when I see Steve Carell all I can think about is Gru, yes sad but true. I digress. The situation with Cal and Emily leads to Cal spending a lot of time in a bar where he then meets Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gossling) a slick womanizing pretty boy. I was not convinced by the whole premise that led to Jacob and Cal bonding, but decided not to give it too much thought. But the fact of the matter is that if Jacob were as self absorbed as he was shown to be he would not have given Cal two minutes of thought, let alone try to help him deal with his circumstances. The most endearing character throughout this whole movie was Robbie (Jonah Bobo). I loved his determination and his honesty regarding how he felt about Jessica (Analeigh Tipton), it was so adorable. And he was right about the four year age difference in a few years it would make no difference at all. I found myself after sitting through approximately forty minutes of this film, slumped down in my seat, yawning while I wondered where it was headed and then started to think about the Whodini song, When We Gonna Get To The Good Part, Get Down To The Good Part. And finally we did get to the good part, when all the outlandishness and asinine behavior brought everything together. And to be perfectly honest I did not see it coming. I sat up took interest once more and thought that the film had taken a very clever turn. I liked the bottom half of the film, but I felt as if the top half was overindulged. I give this film an amber light for taking so long to get to the good part.",Null,1,6,31 July 2011
Rise of the Guardians," Chix Chat on Film Review: Jack Frost has got it going on!
","Rise of the Guardians is the story of legendary characters identified with various Holidays and events working together against a common foe who wants to perpetuate fear. There are four Guardians starting with Santa Claus, who is certainly a Santa for a new generation, with tattoos and a thumb ring North (Alec Baldwin) is an OG (original gangsta) Santa. This story was great PR for Jack Frost (Chris Pine) who has been chosen as the newest Guardian recruit, but he has an issue with belief in him. All that should change as a result of this gem of a tale, and just in time for winter. Of course Jack is a reluctant hero, but those make the best kind. This is now my favorite Jack Frost film and it is much more fun than that live action characterization of him in the Santa Clause 3, which kind of sucked and don't even get me started with that crazy Jack Frost reincarnated fallen father snowman flick, I digress. It was amusing to watch the friendly rivalry between Jack and the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman), the Tooth (Isla Fisher) Fairy was a bit freaky looking, and everybody was more interesting than the Sand Man, which rounds out the crew. That brings me to their nemesis, Pitch Black (Jude Law) who was a not so scary at all Boogey Man. I snickered a bit every time his name was mentioned because sometimes it sounded like a 'B' rather than a 'P' so it was like 'Don't make me slap a Pitch' or That Pitch needs to chillax.' ROTG was one of the most action packed films that I've seen all year, you don't really keep in mind that it is animated as the pace and the intensity heightens. Speaking of the animation it was so delightful with imagery so colorful that small children will love the look of it even if they did not completely grasp the depth of the story with the Guardians fighting for hope, wonder, fund memories and fun. This is a great story of the battle of good versus evil with an iconic team working together to prevent fear from taking hold in the hearts of children, oh and in 3D. There were so many magical moments in this film that I could think of only one thing that would have made the experience better for me and that is if I had seen it with my awesome grandsons, Three and Aries. I give this remarkable film a bright green light.Note: I was really digging Jack's platinum blond do.",8,3,6,25 November 2012
Horrible Bosses," Chix Chat on Film review: Three friends conspire to kill each others horrible boss.
","The horrible bosses that I have experienced in my working lifetime, 'ain't got nothing' on these Horrible Bosses. This was truly a great comedy, with a great ensemble cast. Usually, where comedies are concerned the funniest bits are played out in the trailer and there's little left for the viewing audience once the film starts to roll. Not here, when the jokes that were shown in the trailers are seen in context in the film, they were still fresh and just as funny. The amount of creativity that was at work here to make something as deplorable as sexual harassment, manipulation, and the threat of termination simply is remarkable, especially in times as these. I found it interesting that this film had two Academy Award winners as part of the cast, but they were not pimped like the dramas do when advertising an upcoming release, just an observation. Horrible boss (Academy Award winner) number one Dave Harken (Kevin Spacey) was an absolute nightmare, he wore the arrogance of entitlement like a badge of honor. The fact that he was so unlikeable is a testament to great acting, but in all honesty none of the characters were very likable, especially boss number two Dr. Julia Harris, DDS (Jennifer Aniston) nor boss number three Bobby Pellitt (Colin Farrell). I was thinking that the Bobby Pellitt character was a page right out of the Les Grossman manual, not pretty. All the staff were tormented respectively by the aforementioned bosses Nick Hendricks (Jason Bateman), Jason Sudeikis (Kurt Buckman) and Dale Arbus (Charlie Day), but this was a necessary evil in order us to crack up with hit-man number one Mr. Fantastic, no wait I mean Wetwork man (Ioan Grufford) that segment was killer funny, and hit-man (Academy Award winner) number two Dean 'MF' Jones (Jamie Foxx), this is my favorite look, the dramatic roles are great and all, but Mr. Bishop is a comedic genius, and not to mention hella talented. This film was mostly just crazy funny with the war of the Bosses versus Staff. There was a consistency with the pace that made for never a dull moment. There were surprising cameos, that were never hinted at from the trailers and last but certainly not least there was Gregory. There was a lot going on in this film, and all the pieces fit together like a really cool jigsaw puzzle, once completed I was left with a feeling of fulfillment. Other recent comedies should be green with envy, green light.",Null,0,0,2 August 2011
Underworld Awakening," Chix Chat on Film review: Selene gets back to basics.
","This installment of the Underworld series was the only sequel to premiere this weekend. I have grown to expect a great deal from sequels because my thinking is that if it gets green lit it should also get better funding. Better funding typically translates into better imagery. Underworld: Awakening was one of the best of the four Underworld stories and Rise of the Lycans was the worst, possibly because it was the only one sans Selene (Kate Beckinsale). The trailer tells us that now the Vampire and Lycan threat is that of the humans, based on their discovery of the existence of the underworld beings, but fortunately for the story line the plot thickened. Otherwise this would have been the second movie this weekend for which the trailer unveiled too much. This story was infused with some new blood, Detective Sebastian (Michael Ealy) is added, I appreciated being given insight into his alliances and why. Dr. Jacob Lane (Stephen Rea) is a new player in the battle whose motivations are not known until late in the story. David (Theo James) is also a new character who I immediately thought would add to Selene's evolution from Death Dealer to Day Walker to Cougar, not saying that's what happened but it crossed my mind. The final newcomer was a very clever addition although I find it so corny that whenever a female character is introduced in a story, who is somehow extraordinary that she has the name Eve (India Eisley), we get it already, there's no law against being creative with a name. I wasn't overly impressed with the look of the Lycans they had the projected look seen in old sci-fi B movies, but the over-sized giant Lycan seen in the trailer was a decent special effect. The best special effects were Selene in action doing what she does best, dropping from tall buildings in her signature stance, dealing out death with a graceful ease to the Lycans as well as to the new human enemy all while consistently wearing that signature pout and taking on the world in her plastic cat suit, although the look in the cat suit is all her no effects needed. The story stayed true to the series, it made sense and was none stop action from the beginning until the end. I like the creativity of these types of tales and with all the pretty supernatural and natural folks to focus on it was a viewer's win-win. I give it a green light.",8,17,33,23 January 2012
Life of Pi," Chix Chat on Film Review: Meet Richard Parker.
","As someone who had not read the Life of Pi book, I really did not have any knowledge of this story or what to expect other than what I had seen in the trailer. It seemed like it would be an interesting enough tale and I was curious about what had transpired to bring a young man and a Bengal tiger together in a life boat. This was a spiritual journey that I was so thrilled to have experienced on the big screen. The entire story was filled with opposing ideologies beginning with Pi's discovery of religion. It was interesting that he was able to take a rational look at various religions and apply the teachings to his life that were beneficial, even life saving. The Life of Pi was profoundly engaging, I knew that Pi (Suraj Sharma) would survive the lost at sea ordeal, but none of the intensity of the story was diminished as a result of knowing the outcome. The imagery in this film was spectacular, from the opening scene credits I knew that I was in for a treat when a hummingbird was just inches from my face and literally within my reach. The scenes in which the ocean and the star filled sky seemed to merge into one were breathtaking. I made it a point to view this film in 3-D and it was worth every penny of the premium uplift, and we all know that not all 3-D films are. I'm not sure why anyone would mention Avatar and this film in the same context, although I just did because of the reference in the trailer, but other than the luminescent sea life, the two films have so little in common that it's like someone was reaching to describe the feeling that this story evokes. I love stories that showcase triumph of the human spirit as was the case with this one, but best of all you leave the theater feeling good about life in general, not guilty that your life has been average and happy, not shadowed by some tragedy that makes you evolve into a different person. The two stories told in this film that detailed what happened to Pi (Irrfan Khan) were opposites, I too preferred the one that featured Richard Parker. I was not a fan of the Cowboy story directed by Ang Lee, but am truly enamored by this Indian story, cowboys and Indians still dealing with opposites. This was a good story and I give it a green light.",8,2,4,23 November 2012
Pacific Rim," Chix Chat on Film review: A true monster movie
","What I really want to do is write about Idris Elba (Stacker Pentacost) and how his walk is poetry in motion, and that I could stare at him for the 131 minutes running time of this film with his commanding presence while gracing us with confidence and style, but that would be unfair, since I should discuss Pacific Rim. This film reminded me of the old Godzilla monster movies akin to the likes of Godzilla versus Megalon. Those films always had the populous running for their lives while Tokyo was perpetually being destroyed, but the update to the tale is that the origin of the monster attacks does not come from nuclear fallout. This film was not as campy as the early Godzilla films, but there was a healthy level of cheesiness, although played very straight with Charlie Day (Dr. Newton Geiszler) as the only comic relief, which is somewhat odd since he plays a scientist. He actually looks the part, but if he ever wants to be taken seriously in a role he has to change his voice inflections and tone, which is very comedic. If all the English and Australian actors can do it I'm sure he can. This film was primarily driven by the special effects, since going in there was little doubt as to how the story would end. The last film that I saw that had a truly surprising end was Cabin in the Woods, I digress. The special effects were most noteworthy because the scale of the jaegers and the kaijus was strikingly convincing. With their movements, when the fights broke out and when buildings were destroyed, I simply marveled at the fact that these creations looked remarkably real. I'm not sure why the notion that a tall wall will keep anything out but it was yet again tested in this film, but again the scale was amazing. The kaiju unfortunately were never shown much clearer in the film than what was seen in the trailer, when they appeared it was either dark, raining, shown as a television broadcast or they were underwater all of which were distorting factors. We did get a nice variety though, with similarities to a turtle, gorilla, and a pterodactyl. This was a testosterone filled ride, there were only two females with any dialogue in the entire film and one of them was quite masculine. It seemed that the target audience was tween and teenaged young men who would get a kick out of the fight scenes, there was a miniscule love story but not enough to make this film a female fan favorite. It was entertaining so I give it an amber light.",Null,1,5,13 July 2013
21 Jump Street," Chix Chat on Film review: So much more than the TV show.
","I had low expectations for this film, which is very typical for me when a movie is made based on an old television series, especially so many years after the show is off the air. There have been some successes like Star Trek, and the complete antithesis in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. But, I just figured that the funny scenes from the trailer were about as good as it gets. I was so misguided. There were so many zany happenings throughout 37 Jump Street (you'll understand when you see the film) that I realized I was laughing out loud or had a smile on my face pretty much from the Slim Shady beginning to the plug for a sequel ending. This film painted a picture of how a friendship developed for Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) from within the Police Academy to being partnered for the Jump Street project and it only took a few scenes for the audience to know exactly who these characters were and their history together. I liked that the development of their relationship to present day was not drawn out or made more important than it really was because once they became partners the story just got funnier and funnier. The overly exaggerated angry Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) aided my understanding of embracing stereotypes, the running joke of an impending explosion was both funny and exhilarating, and the whole Peter Pan play made for some of the funniest scenes in any comedy lately. Even though I knew from the trailer that there would be a mention of how old Jenko looked to be in high school, it was still funny when delivered in the film, since the real joke is that in many High School themed movies the actors are too old to play teenagers, here rather than ignore that fact it was embraced. There must be some very potent thespian DNA in the Franko family, Eric Molson (Dave Franko) was played to a tee as an overindulged neglected teen, but with the sensibility of today's biggest plight which is conserving our ecology. The revelation of how much High School has changed was also interesting to say the very least. I have to say until viewing the film I did not even realize DeRay Davis (Domingo) was in it, and before he said or did anything I was cracking up over his tats, you have to really be a bad, bad guy to have a bucket of tears. The only expectation I went into the film with was to see who would return in a cameo, that expectation was met and then some, especially to learn that someone could be right under your nose and you not even know it. I give 21 Jump Street a green light.",8,0,5,18 March 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Chix Chat on Film review: Stephen Rogers becomes Captain America
","I was getting a bit weary of the Marvel super hero stories, but I understand that it is a necessity to introduce this younger movie going generation to them, in anticipation of the upcoming Avengers. To my surprise the film Captain America: The First Avenger was actually quite good. I love the Where's Waldo Stan Lee game we play with each of these Marvel movies. I believe that Mr. Lee has had a cameo in all the films, which is a really nice touch to honor the creator of all these rich comic book characters. I thought from the trailer that this would be another World War II movie, with a twist to the Nazi story, delving into a more colorful fantasy than what was the horrific reality of that war. In fact this film, in telling the Stephen Rogers (Chris Evans) back story gives us a really cool look at the fifties attire, automobiles and how the general public was entertained. We see that the senior Stark, Howard (Dominic Cooper) is a bit of a showoff, like father like son and a technological genius, again like father like son, so some of the weaponry as seen in the Iron Man films when Stark junior has taken over is way more advanced than at all possible. But all the weapons and visuals had a very authentic historical look about them. The one thing that I noticed that was a complete deviation from true history, was that no one in the entire film was shown smoking. We see smoking guns, smoking trains, smoking buildings, but not a single solitary smoking person. In the Fifties EVERYBODY, not just everything smoked. It was amusing to me whenever Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) addressed anyone, I kept thinking Agent K, has used an alien time travel machine and came to WWII to command. And speaking of agents, I am always in favor of a strong female role. Agent Carter (Hayley Atwell) was truly a bright spot in this film, I wanted to see more of a progression of her relationship with Captain America, but there's just never enough time. The special effects were palpable, the pace of the story kept my interest and the warring elements were not so graphic that I was flinching at gore. All in all it was a good action adventure and gets us one step closer to the Avengers. I give it a green light. - Emma Dinkins",Null,15,28,26 July 2011
Oblivion," Chix Chat on Film review: Earth decimated
","Oblivion is the kind of film that once you see the trailer you have high expectations for what it will deliver. It did deliver on some spectacular images from high atop the world in Jack Harper's (Tom Cruise) sky living quarters, where he and Vicka (Andrea Riseborough) are an effective team. Visually, the look of this film was quite imaginative. This was Mr. Cruise's turn at being the 'one', that individual who is the savior of humanity. There were too many scenes that reminded me of The Matrix for me to give this film high marks in the creativity column, I seriously expected that at some point Jack would hold out his hand and fry the drones that were in pursuit. This is another film that gets segmented, but in this case it is a matter of before Julia (Olga Kurylenko) and after Julia. Before, Julia the mood of the story was a ride along with Jack as he performed his duty of drone repairs and it would be putting it mildly to say that it seemed to drone on and one, pun intended. Then after Julia the pace picks up as did my interest in what was taking place and where the plot was leading me. When Jack meets Beech (Morgan Freeman) a Morpheus-like character, again it was just so Matrix-esque he is given instruction as to how he should learn the truth about what was happening, since simply telling him would not could not possibly be accepted or comprehended. The special effects in Oblivion were more the marvel of this film than the story, which was a blending of other films of this genre that had come before it. To be able to convincingly depict a thriving metropolis as a wasteland buried under a desert was amazing, but the real star of the film was the chopper with the on board bike accessory. The maneuverability, compactness and styling of that transport is the kind of concept technology that I would love to see realized by some science geek who would. In a side note, now I understand why there was so little of Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones season two, he was off playing Sykes (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau). Had the before Julia storyline been as engaging as the after Julia story I would have been more inclined to go green, but alas I have to give it an amber light",7,2,5,20 April 2013
Man of Steel," Chix Chat on Film review: A very super man
","Man of Steel the much anticipated reimagined Superman tale was so much less than anticipated by me. Having grown up with the comic books, seen the story played out on television and in theaters for more than 4 decades I was just done. And then along comes this film with a two and a half hour running time, and I simply cringed at the very thought of sitting through another same old story. But, this wasn't the same old story this was a rocket launch into action and an adventure that began almost from the very start with Kal-El/Clark's (Henry Cavill) birth. This is the first time that I recall seeing in live action shown so vividly the planet Krypton before its infamous destruction. The vision of what life on Krypton would have been like and the coup that led to the imprisonment of General Zod (Michael Shannon) has never been rendered with such detail. The action in this story was none stop, all of which was fueled by the special effects. The special effects were so phenomenal that they were barely noticeable, because they worked so seamlessly within the story. They were primarily the art of devastation, from Krypton to huge crafts, to larger than life hand to hand combat with super human strength to Metropolis being all but completely razed, the film was a visual masterpiece. This story was told with a lot of heart, and the running time was necessary to show how much of an inner struggle Clark had with being so different. It wasn't just a natural uneventful growth process like going up in a show size when his powers began to manifest, it was conveyed as a traumatic transition, which made Clark not only likable but you care about him. I'm still trying to decide how I felt about Lois Lane (Amy Adams), she seemed to be too accepting too quickly of all the other worldly events that were transpiring around her, but I guess the situations didn't leave much time for panicking. I noticed hints in the film that there will be a sequel, but I'm having a hard time imagining that Lex Luther who has always been Superman's primary nemesis will be wrapped in a story with the kind of zeal that Christopher Nolan has brought to light here. It turns out that this story was so masterfully done and so entertaining that it has renewed my enthusiasm in the franchise, I give it a green light.",Null,0,1,16 June 2013
Hugo," Chix Chat on Film review: Lives collide in a French train station.
","Since I was not familiar with the book, I can't say that I was excited about Hugo, nor was I anxiously awaiting its release, what I was feeling was curiosity about the story's plot and how would the story be handled by Martin Scorsese given that I knew it was nothing like the films he had previously directed. I sat through the first half hour of this film with absolutely no idea where it was going, I soon saw some familiar faces playing in some key roles George Melies (Ben Kingsley), the Station Inspector (Sasha Baron Cohen), Hugo's Father (Jude Law) and amazingly Monsier Labisse (Christopher Lee). I simply applaud Mr. Lee's career, he is truly a marvel to behold, I remember as a child being scared witless by him as Dracula which was filmed before I was born, later for him to be a part of the Star Wars prequels and as the White Wizard Saruman in the Lord of the Rings trilogy it just boggles my mind that he is still delivering great performances in great films and now for my own children to see and appreciate him in these roles. Not to take anything away for the two young actors who basically carry this film, Hugo (Asa Butterfield) and Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz). Their on screen interaction was very enthralling. I truly hope that they both see long and fruitful careers as has Mr. Lee. So now that I have done exactly as this film did, and have taken forever to get to the point. I will say that this was a really good story about how the lives of a famed French film maker and a young boy intersect. I did find it amusing that the young protagonists were reading a French book in perfect English, but I'm sure that bit of movie magic was for the benefit of the American audience. I was totally on edge during the scene from the movie poster with Hugo hanging from the clock hand. That scene and many others throughout this story were interesting, provocative and actually did elicit the excitement that I initially lacked in relation to this movie. This film was a visual gem, the opening scene was a cinematic treat. Even with the lengthy start to develop the story, which took more time than I thought was necessary to get to the meat of the story, this is a lovely film for adults who can appreciate the art of film making as do I. It gets a well deserved green light.",8,4,6,29 November 2011
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Chix Chat on Film Review: The Hansel and Gretel story continues.
","The movie industry is leaving vampires behind for a while and has started to focus on fairy tales. With two recent takes on Snow White, an upcoming Jack and the Beanstalk tale and now Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters. This film is the continuation of their story and how their lives have evolved after their fateful defeat of the witch in the cottage made of candy. From what I had seen in the trailer my expectation was that the special effects would be amazing and in actuality they were. I saw the film in 3D and was satisfied that they met the quota with things flying off screen directly at me, mostly splintered wood but I did flinch a few times. The acting was not bad either, both Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) were portrayed straight and focused on the task at hand, nothing too over the top and the same goes for their primary nemesis Muriel (Famke Janssen). The problem with the story was that there was this major issue with incongruences. The weaponry used to snare witches was too advanced, even if you have to wind up a stun gun, it's still a stun gun. The era was tied to the time that witches were being burned at the stake, which in Salem was the late 1600s and the first gatling gun was not invented until around 1860. Congruence matters, I know this is as I stated originally an updated fairy tale, but I'm just saying. Had the story been truly updated and told during modern times it might have made more sense that they used automatic weaponry, I had less of an issue with the flying around on brooms since that is a witch staple. Then there was the whole Gretel being lost in the woods moment and then magically she is in a cottage. The story wasn't entirely awful, because it did make these familiar characters from a child hood fairy tale richer. It was entertaining and I liked that Gretel was a tough girl, but some things could have been done differently that would have me like it more than I did. This film would not lose anything if viewed on the Syfy channel in the comfort of your own home, in fact it would fit in nicely and be a slight step up because of the special effects. I give it a red light.",3,8,20,28 January 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Chix Chat on Film Review: A Spiders tale respun.
","I still contend that it was too soon to reset the series, however The Amazing Spiderman was not too bad. The biggest problem for me was that the other actors who portrayed the key characters so recently were still very fresh in my mind. I did like that this Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) brought a heightened level of masculinity to the role or at least as much as could be expected for a man swinging through the city in red and blue tights with his junk on prominent display. So this time around the protagonist that Spiderman must square off against is Dr. Curt Conners (Rhys Ifans) who is pretty much an enigma the entire film, there are hints that he may have played a part in the death of Peters parents, there are hints that he is involved in some unscrupulous dealings within Oscorp, but nothing is ever clearly defined. Not even the basis of his greatest loss, which was his motivation for the research that led him to the genesis of the Lizard. Speaking of which, why did the Lizard remind me of Venon from the last Spiderman (Tobey Maguire)? I know he had scales and a tail, but he sure looked a lot like the same special effect. The story of Peter Parker and his encounter with a radio-active or genetically altered spider is consistently the basis of the transformation into Spiderman, even with his acclimation to his new abilities taking place very rapidly it still seemed tedious since it all just played out not so long ago. What I found to border on the ridiculous though was how easily Peter gained access to the spiders. A state of the art lab with state of the art technology and security would not have an area with potentially dangerous specimens so unattended, still it all just seemed too familiar. Same old same Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) solid pillars of the earth and nothing special. I will say that I enjoyed the romance that played out between Peter and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) as it seemed very organic, fresh and genuine. Obviously, there will be sequels, but now I have Mr. Garfield in my mind overlaying my visualization of Mr. Maguire as Spidey. If the sequel is fresh and has some new discovery for Peter in store, like really utilizing his 'spidey senses' then I may be a bit more enthusiastic about hitting the theater to check it out. As it stands 'been there, done that' so it gets an amber light.",7,1,3,9 July 2012
X-Men: Days of Future Past," A Chix Chat on Film review: Humans vs Mutants vs Sentinels
","The title of this film and the trailer made it quite clear that the plot would deal with time travel. With time travel there's always the risk of some paradox, but my thoughts were that there was a need for some type of event or portal to an alternate universe or something phenomenal to reclaim characters that had been lost to in prior X-Men installments. Days of Future Past tells a very creative story surrounding the Sentinels, which we only previously got a glimpse of in a school training exercise. The design of the newest X-Men nemesis in this film was spectacular; the special effects were sublime in conveying how impervious to most any attack these massive creations were. I recall from the animated series on television how all the key characters battled against the Sentinels, which would have been basically impossible with so many of the X-Men having met their demise in The Last Stand. There were a few new mutants introduced in this new tale, Adam Cantu from televisions The Following as Sunspot, Booboo Stewart best known from The Twilight Saga is all grown up as Warpath and most notably Evan Peters as Quicksilver. Quicksilver was an integral part of getting things moving, no pun intended, his character was the most entertaining because he was both quirky and uncontrollable. He was not one of the characters that recalled as front and center from the animated series, but he certainly made a lasting impression and will hopefully be back. Aside from the new mutants the other very interesting aspect of the story was the state of existence the players were in from where we left them at the end of First Class. This was a young Professor that I had never known. Rather than go on about all the things that made this a great film. I will suffice it to say that it was the best in the series so far. It was creative and masterfully told. I loved it and am looking forward to the next story featuring Apocalypse, who as I recall was a most difficult foe. BTW if you haven't seen this film yet, be sure to stick around after the final scenes for an after credits treat.",10,0,3,27 May 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Chix Chat on Film Review: More Middle Earth mayhem.
","I am truly happy when an original story is brought to the big screen, in the case of The Hobbit it is by no means original, but Peter Jackson's treatment of it makes it feel original and new. I expected to be transported back into a world full of fantasy and adventure and was not disappointed. The opening scenes with Bilbo (Ian Holm) felt comfortable and familiar for easing into a nice long sitting. The running time was longer than I would have preferred but it is what it is. This story filled in some holes from the Lord of the Rings trilogy specifically how Bilbo (Martin Freeman) came to possess the one ring, what mass destruction came to fall upon Moria, how golf was invented and what caused the rift between the Dwarfs and Elves. This film invests the viewer in the future of the Dwarfs. There was a regal aura about Thorin (Richard Armitage), the Dwarf King portrayal was first rate and made the harrowed journey that had brought him to this point clear, as was the reason for his no nonsense demeanor. Gandalf (Ian McClellan) at several points in the film seemed to be the main focus of the story, I had to consciously remember that this was a story about a hobbit. The manipulation of events by Gandalf which allowed the adventure to take a detour to Rivendell delivered even more familiar faces. It brought a smile to my face seeing Elrond (Hugo Weaving) and Lady Galadriel (Cate Blanshett), but I wouldn't have minded seeing Legolas once more. I couldn't help but grimace a bit when Saruman (Christopher Lee) entered the equation and began casting doubt on what was actually taking place, especially since his nefarious intentions are clearly known. This film has beautiful expansive landscapes, exquisite special effects and engaging characters. My only complaint was the two hours and forty plus minutes running time, that added with the trailers was just more time than I wanted to commit to a film, however when I emerged from the theater some three hours later it felt as though I had been in time warp, because at the end of the film that wasn't an end but a beginning, I was left wanting more. What could possibly be wrong with a film that has all nature of fantasy and where the pastime of the peaceful hobbits and wizards is puffing on a pipe with questionable contents? I give it a green light.",9,1,7,16 December 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Chix Chat on Film review: Mission Possible: Great Action
","After having experienced all the previous Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) chronicles, I knew this would be an action adventure treat and I was not in the least bit disappointed. This was the best film of the year for action, not once did I lose interest in what was taking place on screen. The journey to Dubai with the scaling of the skyscraper was still very intense even after having seen bits of it numerous times in the trailers. Mr. Cruise is amazingly brave or just plain retarded to do his own stunts, either way the action scenes have a credibility that exceeds pretty much everything else that's comparable when extreme stunts are featured. Jane Carter (Paula Patton) was an awesome new addition to the Mission Impossible team. The name is very generic but there was nothing generic about Ms. Patton holding her own as an action star. This was a very good look for her, she was very convincing kicking butt. Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) the newly added tech wiz was exactly what I expected, great comic relief and finally the enigmatic William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) completed the team that put a smile on my face as I exited the theater. I only had two issues with this film, first the opening credits with the fuse was cheesy and secondly the Ethan and Jane kiss was totally unnecessary, but I just figured that Mr. Cruise could not resist capitalizing on his star power to get a lip lock with Mr. Thicke's wife, she is very beautiful after all. I was very pleased with the story and how it bridged the time since the last mission so that we quickly get caught up with what had been taking place in Ethan's life. The shock and awe sequence that put Ethan and William together and the pretty bow that tied everything up in the end was superb. I know that the whole car flipping scene from the trailer is computer generated imagery, but it looked really good. I know that Dubai is in the middle of the desert and sand storms occur, and the sand storm most likely was CGI too, but it was some kind of awesome. It looked so real I had to keep sipping on my drink, I started to feel parched. This is a movie that I would actually pay to see in the theater again, it was worth the price of the admission. It gets a bright green light.",9,3,7,3 January 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Chix Chat on Film review: The Beginning of Ape world domination.
","I was really looking forward to seeing Rise of the Planet of the Apes, because I can recall as a child having seen a number of these ape based stories and they never seemed to really explain how this all came about. I wanted to see this story for the nostalgia factor and to see if it would align with the classics or the Mark Wahlberg version. It turned out to be more in tuned with the classics. This film does explain what happened to elevate the apes to the dominate species and in this age of scientific and technological advancement, the origin was completely plausible. Will Rodman (James Franco) is the antithesis of the mad scientist, but his obsession with finding a cure for degenerative brain disorders puts him right in that category. I was struck by how far he kept going in his quest for a cure while totally ignoring every single hint or warning. And his girlfriend Caroline Aranha (Frieda Pinto) was no help with the moral compass, she only once in five years questioned his ethics. Speaking of people behaving badly, Tom Felton (Dodge Landon) wasted no time putting himself out there with a persona other than Draco Malfoy, he did a respectable job with the American accent, and the trivia relative to his character's name is pretty cool. There was a lot of painstaking character development given to Caesar (Andy Serkis) that I didn't find necessary, it seemed to take forever to get to the climatic freeway bridge scene. Are chimps indigenous to the San Francisco Bay Region or did the residents go through some pet rock or rather pet chimp phase? The novelty of being a chimp owner must have worn off and then they called animal control to come and get their apes. There were so many apes that I finally just said 'oh come on, really?'. The special effects were nicely done, especially the freeway bridge scene. I thought about how many times I have seen that bridge destroyed in other movies and really expected to see Caesar pull out some C-4 or something and blow the bridge to get the humans off his trail, just kidding, although he did pull off some antics that were a bit much. Right, right I know heightened intelligence. I was quite satisfied with the adult Caesar's appearance, he looked remarkably realistic, the younger version of Caesar not so much. I came very close to giving this film a green light to match the enhanced ape's eyes, but decided on an amber light instead.",Null,0,5,6 August 2011

","I thought that the most intriguing thing about Django Unchained, was going to be figuring out how could a Black man in America during slavery possibly become a bounty hunter and most importantly would the constructed tale be plausible. Not only did Quentin Tarantino (writer/director) make it believable he made it worth sitting through the 2 hour and forty-five minute running time. Initially as seen in the trailer Django (Jamie Foxx) is requisitioned by Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) a German dentist to assist him in his current trade, from there the adventure begins and includes the task of reuniting Django with his wife. The dialogue was filled with far too many nickels for my taste, but there were consequences for its usage which shows that there is a cost for speaking ugly words. Uncle Ruckus, I mean Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) was the character that you immediately love to hate, the portrayal was so convincing that I watched him in every scene with a measure of contempt. I have become accustomed to the signature excessive blood spatters when flesh is injured typical of a Tarantino film, but the gore and carnage in this film was a bit much even for Mr. Tarantino. I guess that pushing the envelope with the savagery is his way of being explosive. This film had shocking moments that took me to the limits of disgust like the Mandingo fights and there were moments that took me to the opposite end of the spectrum by Django's love for Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). Ms. Washington is a natural beauty but her acting chops were only challenged here by anguish, I guess a man's man has a hard time thinking up what a slave woman would say so she had very little dialogue, but she did emote well. I don't know what the emotional response was that was expected from the viewing of this film, but I was left somewhere in the middle. The middle of the scale for those two extremes is indifference. The final scenes were a payoff and I especially liked the horse tricks, but I'm trying to decide if it was a big enough pay off to lean more towards favoring the story or reviling the violence. This one was difficult to gauge, it was entertaining but I'm somewhat embarrassed to admit that I laughed at some of the uncanniest things like the klan. I will linger on the middle ground with an amber light.",6,4,14,26 December 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," Chix Chat on Film review: A Marvelous tale
","For a Sci-fi film with enviable comic relief this story had to have one of the saddest opening scenes ever when we first encounter a young Peter Quill (Wyatt Oleff), who appears to be just any small town USA young boy experiencing a devastating hardship, then his life takes an incredible turn for the unexpected. What this scenes does besides pose a question of who fathered him it sets up the soundtrack that accompanies the entire film, since in 1988 everyone had their Sony Walkman and Peter was no exception. We immediately fast forward to 26 years later and find an adult Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) who is a bit of a scalawag, on a commissioned job to retrieve a mysterious orb, which leads to unimaginable adventure. The story of how the Guardians came together was happening on the forefront, but there were also some other major stories taking place like a maniacal Ronan (Lee Pace) bent on destroying a world, Drax (Dave Bautista) driven by revenge, whatever the heck was going on with Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker) who was some sort of space pirate and a sibling rivalry that made for one of the great fight scenes. There were a number of things that tied this film to other stories that have been told focusing on the Marvel Universe including Benicio Del Toro reprising his role as the Collector who we only encounter briefly in Thor the Dark World (after credits) and Thanos another after credits character previously introduced. The special effects in this film were as big a star as the actual stars especially for the only characters who were already in league together, Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel). These characters always felt as real as Star-Lord, Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Drax. Who would have expected to come to a movie and feel any kind of emotional attachment to a raccoon?! If you stick around through the credits you will understand why the effects were first rate, there had to be at least ten animation companies credited. As with all the Marvel films there is an after credits scene, however the thing is if you are too young to remember the pop culture of the 80s you may not get the joke. This was storytelling at its best, and was very entertaining from beginning to end.",9,0,4,3 August 2014
Evil Dead," Chix Chat on Film review: Scary remake no comic relief
","A remake is always a risky undertaking because it will invariably be compared to the original. In the case of Evil Dead I couldn't shake thoughts of two other films,' The Cabin in The Woods' and a short which I had the pleasure of viewing at SXSW 'Hell No', unfortunately I did not get a chance to see Evil Dead at SXSW, which was also screened, but I decided not to miss out on it. This update of the original campy horror flick was a veritable blood bath or perhaps I should say blood shower, but no matter how you slice it there was a lot of blood and gore. The reason that it brought CITW to mind was that I saw that film recently and it was somewhat patterned off the original with five young people in an isolated cabin, although there was some comic relief in Cabin. The fact that this story was played out so straight just added to the fear factor. I only buried my face in my hands once to avoid the on screen mayhem, which is pretty good considering that any film with a demonic possession theme gets a license for any nature of next level bodily harm. This group came to the cabin to assist Mia (Jane Levy) with her personal demons and decided that this was the best place to help her. Mia's brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) is described as 'absent' when the going gets tough, so of course he chose this situation to step up. The group enter the cabin and find that is smells of death but still stay and then ignore every single hint and warning that could avoid unleashing evil, thus the horror is set in motion. HN came to mind as I watched every opportunity to make a sound decision quickly get passed on which makes it clear that if the characters employ good rational sense it would make for a very short horror film. The special effects used to create the gruesome slice/dice, boiled flesh, dismemberment and such, was visually too frighteningly real, again adding to the fear factor. If you have an appreciation for a great horror tale where you get to see beautiful people tortured from the inside out and the outside in then this is the film for you. I found it to be entertaining and scary. The scenes with the nail gun where graphic enough that I never want a nail gun around me again. I give it a green light.",8,5,18,11 April 2013
Hotel Transylvania," Chix Chat on Film Review: Monstermania.
","Hotel Transylvania comes across in the trailer as a monster good time where Count Dracula (Adam Sandler) hosts all the legendary monsters at his hotel to celebrate his daughter's birthday while he works overtime to keep his daughter from falling for a human, who haphazardly stumbles upon the hotel. The story was interesting in how humans were viewed from the point of view of the monsters, as not just the enemy but as fearsome. I couldn't really figure out why Johnny (Andy Samberg) would be out hiking alone in Transylvania, I couldn't figure out why Mavis (Selena Gomez) wouldn't just bat out and see Haweewee or the world for that matter, and I couldn't figure out why Drac's bat was only slightly sun sensitive. There was some fun to be had watching this film and it was clear how when anyone ages, their idea of fun is totally different from that of young hundred and eighteen year olds. I did notice from the laughter in the theater that children don't really get it with some of the humor it just has to be physical, and I know that the children didn't understand the underlying story of an overprotective father. But, with the very spirited young wolves, the green smoke joke and all the colorful creatures, this was a good film for tweens. There was an interesting moment when Johnny was asked if he believed that humans, all humans were ready to accept monsters, but the reality is even with films like Twilight romanticizing a relationship with a vampire, it doesn't change the fact that if a being came out of the coffin who lives off of human blood, survival instincts on both sides would kick in and someone would have to go! I was fond of Ceelo's mummy and found Steve Buscemi's wolf to be as believable as any father with a massive brood, exhausted! Fran Drescher's Eunice was so Real Housewives of New Jersey and Luenell's Shrunken Head cracked me up. I have to agree with Johnny that Dracula's accent and behavior was over the top. It was kind of creepy when he would fang out, yet this was a charming little story that was entertaining and fun even if Mavis did borrow from Puss in Boots when she wanted her way. It will garner an audience that will appreciate it for what it is, an hour and a half of movie viewing escapism. I give it an amber light.",6,5,13,28 September 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Chix Chat on Film Review: Bella and Edward, forever.
","The love story between Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson) is the draw for the ladies and the supernatural creatures battling it out is the draw for the guys so with Breaking Dawn Part 2 everybody gets something out of the story. But I did not imagine that fans were so emotionally involved until I witnessed a woman seated to my left in the theatre audibly began to cry during the climactic battle that is shown in the trailer, when a beloved character falls. I have shed a tear or two over scenes in movies, but never a lingering 'nooooooooo!' will I utter. Seriously, I really like the stories, I read the first book and part of the second, but it is still just a movie, the characters are not real. Besides rather than enhance my movie going experience by having read the book first it tarnishes it, but that's just me. This final film was actually very interesting, creative and cleverly crafted. The story provided for answers to questions that I didn't know that I had, like the whole immortal child story. This did provide for some insight into the Volturi zero tolerance policy, but never a reason for their extreme cruelty. I did find that baby Renesmee was a bit too animated for my taste so it was hard to appreciate what was supposed to be extracted from her ability to communicate. Bella's story was worth experiencing on the big screen and held my attention through all the films. I was never team Edward or team Jacob (Taylor Lautner) but I always felt that Jacob was more endearing, maybe because out of the two he brooded less. The whole imprinting on the new born was a little freaky if I give it too much thought, so I stopped over thinking it. Aside from the appearance of baby Renesmee, the special effects in this film would have you convinced that people could transform into over-sized wolves, the Bella rock climbing and that massive crack in the ground looked truly realistic. It's no secret that I really appreciate cool FX, which made this film a gem in my mind. I'm not broken up about this series ending any more than I was about Harry Potter ending, it just makes way for the next epic story that makes people wonder 'what if?'. I liked the shock and awe moments and I thoroughly enjoyed the mitigated collateral damage. Part 2 gets a green light.",8,2,12,17 November 2012
Super 8," Chix Chat on Film review: A train crash in small town America unleashes the unexpected.
","It has been months since I first saw the Super 8 trailer and had all sorts of wild speculation as to the plot and the meaning, I only recently realized it was the film format. Not an especially interesting subject to make someone consider learning more, but the fact that the film had J. J. Abrams name on it was enough for me to want to see it. I couldn't help but to wonder if there were some autobiographical elements at play relative to having a passion for film making even as a youngster. At the start of the film I wasn't sure when the story was based and then came an amazingly pleasant surprise from the soundtrack, it was The Commodores song Easy. I was immediately transported to the Seventies, so many favorable memories what a fantastic era. As the movie progressed I thought OMG what if right in the middle of all my teenage fun, an extra terrestrial crashed the party. It is well into the film before we see the creature, but the effects used to convey size and girth were just as menacing as if it had actually been seen on screen. My imagination started to run wild, I fully expected a Cloverfield-like creature, but no we do get an original. In fact after having seen the recent trailers, I thought the creature was Dr. Woodward (Glynn Turman) who was pretty much a mess the entire film. This story was so much more than a coming of age tale with young people filming a movie, it was chalked full of life lessons, a father and sons bonding experiences, military cover-ups, the collateral damage from excessive drinking, the power of forgiveness, I really could go on and on with the lessons but I just have to take some time to talk about the talented young actors. Joe (Joel Courtney) really carried this film which is truly amazing since this is pretty much the net of his film resume (IMDb). The young actor completely held his own against a real veteran Alice (Elle Fanning), and I kept thinking wow, she is acting at acting like she is acting now that's an actress! The future for these two as well as the other members of their crew looks very bright. The thing that I love most about J. J. Abrams work is his ability to make you think what if. This film gets a green light from the earth to the stratosphere, it was thoroughly enjoyable.BTW, the showing of the short film The Case during the credits was a hilarious treat.",Null,0,0,10 August 2011
Sinister," Chix Chat on Film Review: A creepy thrill.
","This film is definitely a new look for Ethan Hawke (Ellison Oswalt), and it was a whole lot of him. Most of the scenes consisted of Ellison drinking and freaking out. I don't recall ever having seen Mr. Hawke in a horror flick before. Actually, I would say that this tale about the mass murder of entire families was more of a creepy thriller than a horror flick. There were indeed some horrific occurrences, but I have to say that I appreciated the fact that it wasn't simply a gorefest, and that there was an actual story to be told. Ellison is a writer and in an attempt to reclaim the glory from once having had a top selling crime story, he moves his family into the home of a family that has recently been murdered. I found the fact that his wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance) preferred to know as little as possible about the what, when and how of Ellison's preparation for acquiring the reference material for his new book. Not so surprising in this case ignorance is not bliss. The trailer did a good job of conveying just how creepy this film is, with the scene of Ellison's son Trevor (Michael Hall D'Addario) bending over backwards out of a moving box. That little exercise in flexibility turned out to be a red herring, but it was still pretty creepy. Fortunately, there was some comic relief that came in the form of Deputy So and So (James Ransome), who was so much more helpful than one would think upon the initial meeting. It was too funny when he rattles off to Ellison exactly how he felt about moving his family into that house. The explanation of who the culprit is in this case was delivered in a plausible manner, so I had no real issues with the story telling. I knew fairly early in the story how the murders were being executed, pun intended, so there was that level of predictability. I'm so not a horror genre fan, my idea of an acceptable horror flick is Happily N'Ever After, but this film wasn't too bad to experience. A lesson learned is if you knowingly move your family into a house where the entire family was murdered and there are no leads for an arrest, then don't expect that you will have a different outcome. But hey if people could take a hint, there would be no horror stories. I give it an amber light.",7,2,4,16 October 2012
Jack Reacher," Chix Chat on Film Review: Reacher is the Man!
","Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) is the tale of a very astute ex-military policeman. The army training came in quite handy as he digs into the evidence of a heinous crime that turns out to be not at all what it seems to be on the surface. I was surprised at how funny the dialogue in this film was, it is definitely not a comedy, but the sarcastic and comedic one-liners kept coming, even in situations that were completely devoid of a humorous setting there was some very amusing conversation. There was even a scene in which Reacher is attacked in a bathroom that had me cracking up at the bumbling bad guys. The comedy was heightened even further with the old codger Cash (Robert Duvall). Mr. Duvall always delivers a convincing performance, same here. As with any film that features Mr. Cruise the expectation is that it will be fast paced and very entertaining, same here. The only thing missing was his trademark sprint to or after something or anything. I've just come to expect to see him running, really running but we are getting older. The trailer is the only kind that I like, the ones that do not give away the whole movie. It shows that Reacher is bad a$$ without playing out every aspect of the story. David Oyelowo (Emerson) is one to watch, he is building an impressive resume and it is easy to see why because whenever he portrays a character he is that character. When he played a pilot in Red Tails, I totally believed he could fly a plane. When he was the head of a company experimenting on Apes, I was again thoroughly convinced and I believed every aspect of his being a police detective. One of the best car chase scenes that I've seen lately was in this film. There were so many attributes of this film that I liked, including the sexual tension between Reacher and Helen Ronin (Rosamund Pike) that I will just sum it up by saying. Everything just seemed to be genuine and authentic, even though I know that the fights are staged they looked logistically correct, but Steven Segal did come to mind. I liked that the film had a legitimate beginning and end, even if there are subsequent Jack Reacher tales to follow, there was no gaping wide open door of a final scene leaving the audience wondering 'What's up with that?!?'. But I do hope there are sequels, at least one. I give it a green light",8,162,255,21 December 2012
In Time," Chix Chat on Film review: Time is Money.
","This film gave me the impression that the term 'time is money' was very inspiring to Andrew Niccol, who wrote and directed this very creative take on a society that uses time as the most valuable currency. There was practically never a dull moment for Will Salas (Justine Timberlake) throughout the story or for me. The trailer gives great insight into the premise of the story and reveals that Will acquires a great deal of time per chance meeting with Henry Hamilton (Matt Bomer). Will sets out on a journey delving into the lives of the time wealthy and this leads him to Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried), where the adventure begins. There was enough attention to detail in explaining the class warfare in this time society that you understood what was going on, but no explanation as to how it came to be. When the film was over it left me with questions about the body clock, how does it work, who put them on people, was it genetic testing that could stop the physical aging process at twenty-five, did the genome experiments lend way to a method that allows feigned immortality? These are questions I wanted to know, but I'm probably giving this whole convoluted idea too much thought, which then made me think about how talented Justine Timberlake is. As Will he's athletic what with all the running to save time, he was able to leap from a building in a single bound, he could dance and he shows he's an amazing driver. The only thing left to do to showcase his star power was to take a page from the Elvis play book and let him serenade Silvia. Too cheesy? Yeah, I thought so too. How 'bout them Timekeepers? Raymond Leon (Cillian Murphy) was one dedicated time cop, and of course his young protégé Timekeeper Jaegar (Collins Pennie) was more apathetic towards the time crimes and a bit too sympathetic to the perpetrators. The policing of time in this film is not to be confused with Jean Claude Van Dam's Time Cops, this story fortunately had nothing to do with time travel, but it did show that in any society it doesn't matter what the circumstances the people in the ghetto do not like the Po-po's. Although, this film took elements from the well known Bonnie and Clyde story and meshed it with Robin Hood, it was still fresh and new. I wouldn't say that it's a timeless masterpiece in storytelling, but I am glad that I took the time to see it. I give it a bright neon green light.",Null,0,4,30 October 2011
Ice Age: Continental Drift," Chix Chat on Film Review: Ice Age with increased star power..
","Ice Age Continental Drift is the fourth film in this animated series that follows the migration of a group of unlikely friends across continents as their lives evolve. Manny (Ray Romano) and Ellie (Queen Latifah) now have to contend with a teenage Peaches (Keke Palmer) and just about everything surrounding that relationship and her growth was so cliché. Any and every teenage coming of age story ever written, acted out in a play or on screen was covered in one-liners like 'just be yourself', which we know isn't possible since teenagers typically don't know who they are. This story introduced a number of new characters which most of which we will likely see in the next installment. With the whole teenage scenario came Ethan (Drake) the object of Peaches affection. We finally get a glimpse into the sloth family and have a better understanding of the reason Sid's (John Leguizamo) a sloth apart, this story brought another new character his Granny (Wanda Sykes). As things get adventurous we encounter another group of unlikely companions led by Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage) a primate who is just mean for no apparent reason, but his crew included Shira (Jennifer Lopez), who comes with the best storyline. My favorite character of them all for whatever reason is and has always been Diego (Dennis Leary) so to see in the trailers that a female saber is now in the picture led me to hope that he would finally meet his match. As always the animation looks great, even though the stories are very elementary. I tried to stay interested by calling upon my inner child during the viewing but at one point almost dozed off. This could have something to do with just returning home from a Mississippi Gulf vacation that included late nights, but I digress. This film targets young children and during the screening the physical comedy garnered the desired reaction, laughter. There was an entire Ewok adventure that caused some ooos for cuteness, and there was a slightly frightening siren segment that caused some ahhs. The whole opening segment featuring Scrat chasing that nut was so absurd that I wanted to leave but figured that I should stay since those episodes would just be sprinkled throughout the film and are not the entirety of the story. I was not impressed by much of anything in this film, but as a summer release for kids and based on the sounds in the theater it clearly worked for them, for that reason I give it an amber light.",6,2,2,15 July 2012
Dark Shadows," Chix Chat on Film Review: Some time spent with a vamp.
","When I originally saw the trailer for Dark Shadows, my first thought was why would Tim Burton remake this classic supernatural television series drama about a tormented vampire named Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) into a comedy? My second thought was this is going to suck, no pun intended. Turns out it wasn't really a comedy as much as it was a comedic take on the Barnabas situation. It was actually fairly masterfully done keeping the tone of the film balanced between comedy and creepy, although the funniest comedic dialogue was in the trailer. I was pretty young when the series aired on television, but I did recognize the names of most of the characters and their demeanors, so the film did stay pretty much true to the Elizabeth Collins (Michele Pfeiffer) persona of a cold and calculating woman putting her own interests first. I don't recall much about her daughter Carolyn Stoddard (Chloe Grace Moretz), but I was more fascinated by Ms. Moretz than her role. Did I miss the time warp memo? First of all wasn't she like ten in Hugo and wasn't that just last year and now she's fifteen. Speaking of a time warp, how is it that Alice Cooper looked just as old in 1972 as he does today? And for comedy sake the Alice Cooper being a woman joke is just old, as is the balls joke, and now I just feel like I'm ranting. So here's the thing, I wanted to see a wildly original film that would be fun and memorable, and it just didn't turn out that way. There were the obvious Beetlejuice moments, and there were moments that the story was so stalled that I almost dozed off. I will say though that the recreation of 1972 was pretty cool, as an eleven year old I found the psychedelic age fascinating and hearing the Curtis Mayfield Superfly soundtrack as a backdrop to that film with the name prominently displayed on the small town movie marquee totally took me back. Unfortunately, that same type of fond memory was not the end result from viewing Dark Shadows, even with Johnny Depp and Michelle Pfeiffer leading the cast, it just fell short. Angelique (Eva Green) was supposed to be a super villain and I found nothing about her or her vendetta to be at all interesting, the most interesting character was Willie (Jackie Earle Haley), whose apathy was probably what I could relate to most, with that I give this film an amber light, only because of my Superfly moment.",5,4,8,12 May 2012
Prometheus," Chix Chat on Film Review: Alien a new beginning.
","Prometheus is the name of the spaceship built by Weyland Corp, a staple in the Alien series, to explore a star system that the lead scientist Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) believes holds the key to understanding the origin of human-kind. She chooses to believe that 'the engineers' of human DNA as depicted in ancient drawings are inviting mankind to come on by and say 'hi'. I had seen the trailer and heard her say that so many times that when it was finally delivered in the film, I just wanted to slap her, and I had a slap for Captain Janek (Idris Elba) with that stupid country accent, and a few other crew members for just being plain stupid. This was one of those rare occasions when I was glad the actor did not consistently maintain his characters accent, Janek was much better when the accent failed. I understand that you have to have a heaping helping of idiots to make for all the mayhem that can jump off on a distant alien planet, but really how can everyone be so cavalier? I expected this Alien prequel (whether you call it that or not) to provide answers, but I was left with even more questions. For one thing what happened to a light year for measuring distance in space travel? When did space travel start to measure distance in kilometers with a mathematical formula that only a genius level mathematician can decipher? Evidently, some time prior to 2093. In just 80 years the technology will be phenomenal, there are space ships that are architectural marvels, the ability to preserve life in hyper-sleep, man has created near perfect synthetic humanoids, and with monitoring equipment on everything and everybody, how is it that when you get a knock at your front door you can't see who or what is there and just open the portal? Why is nobody afraid? What happened to 'be afraid, be very afraid'? I will say that the cinematography and special effects were supreme, the opening credits landscape shots were breathtaking, but why is it that every planet worthy of exploration is in close proximity to or is a Saturn clone? Putting my questions aside, Michael Fassbender (David) gave a brilliant performance. His lack of emotion conveying a personality completely devoid of compassion seemed so effortless, as a synthetic he walked the walk and talked the talk. Hopefully my questions were not misleading giving an impression that I was less than amazed, quite the contrary this film met my every expectations and is definitely green light material.",9,3,6,8 June 2012
The Croods," Chix Chat on Film review: Thinking outside the cave.
","I was excited about seeing The Croods, because my grandchildren are visiting and I figured it would be a nice little treat for them. We decided to try it out in 3-D since the colors looked so vivid in the trailer. This turned out to be a very bad idea, as soon as we placed the glasses on the youngest he started screaming and buried his face in his mom's chest, the older one refused to wear the glasses so he watched the entire movie out of phase. The appearance of the landscape and the exotic animals was striking because the colors were so vivid. The 3-D special effects continue to impress me as they evolve and enhance the movie going experience, there were moments when it seemed that you could reach out and touch what was taking place on screen, which is apparently what frightened the little ones. It was an interesting concept to apply current events to a family that starts out in fear and darkness dwelling in a cave for survival and having a rebellious teenaged daughter shed some light on the fact that it is time for change. I was surprised that the story even played out a road trip replete with, 'are we there yet' so as to show a relatable family. I assumed from the name that the Croods was a play on words and that they would be well, crude. Gold star for Emma (me, but Emma Stone (Eep) can have one too), they were very crude but were also quick studies. This was a very smart story in that when they knew better they did better. There was nothing in the story that was especially original, but the handling of the themes was refreshing, like the overprotective father, the dysfunctional relationship with the mother in law and the coming of age story for Eep (Emma Stone) .The alpha male competitiveness was fun to watch between Grug (Nicholas Cage) and Guy (Ryan Reynolds), who was an advanced thinker and master puppeteer. In all this was a very entertaining film with some clever word plays, there were times that it strayed from the prehistoric age and got a bit too modern like with the umbrellas, but the belt was really cute. It's a good film for both children and adults, however I think the best fit for children is sans the 3-D. I give it a green light.",8,2,5,24 March 2013
Flight," Chix Chat on Film Review: Prepare for take off!
","Flight is the story of a commercial pilot Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) who is able to land a defective plane with extraordinary skill, maneuvering it into an inverted position in order to slow the decent. We see this inverted flight captured in the trailer, but believe it or not this is not the most provocative element of this film. The story is so thought provoking that it will have you walking out of the theater questioning whether or not you could or would choose nobility over self-preservation. Most of what takes place behind the scenes looming like a predator waiting to strike is the blame game, with Whip continuously asserting that no one could have landed that plane except him. That point is supported but it's the collateral damage of his arrogance that is at the forefront of determining liability. The trailer also lets the audience in on the fact that Whip is found to have alcohol in his system as is discussed with Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle) who is the attorney brought in to defend Whip on behalf of the Pilot's association. Hugh was very straight and very narrow, which was the case with most of the characters aside from Whip. It was the dichotomy of Whip's persona so brilliantly conveyed in his mannerisms, responses, and facial expressions that makes the performance Oscar, Golden Globe, BET, Trumpet, Image, MTV and any other awards worthy. If Mr. Washington had uttered eight bars I would say he deserves a Hip Hop award or a Grammy, he was that convincing. I recognized this person that Mr. Washington portrayed so true to life, which is not just a testament to good writing, but mostly to the phenomenal acting talent that is Denzel. All the characteristics that made this individual a hero were the same characteristics that could potentially make him infamous. I will say that I as well as many fans am always open to greater insight into who Denzel is, however the rear view was totally unnecessary. The film does a great job of telling a story about the human condition, nobody is one dimensional and sometimes extreme circumstances make you write yourself a reality check. The question is when you cash that check will you be happy with the results. If you have any fear of flying this is not the movie for you. It will reinforce that fear and possibly cause you to swear off flying altogether. I give this film a green light.",8,41,74,3 November 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Chix Chat on Film review: An epic end to the story of The Boy Who Lived.
","It seems hard to conceive that we have reached the end of an era, a decade long conflict of good versus evil, and during this time having witnessed the growth to adulthood of a generation of wizards. Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) with his closest friends, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and constant nemesis Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) all met with their destiny head on, and the final battles were epic. The Harry Potter story is now completed, but there are so many other characters that could take us back to the wizarding world. I have mixed feelings about anyone attempting to recreate something as amazing as this series, since it most likely would not measure up. Even though some of the supporting characters did not have much depth as compared to the primary wizards it was still nice to see them in the final story, Neville (Matthew Lewis), Dean (Alfie Enoch), Seamus (Devon Murray), and the Weasleys, the whole red-headed lot of them. I have to mention that even though Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter) is an evil b!tch, she was one of my favorite characters because of how richly animated she is portrayed. The visual effects in this film were phenomenal, I was aware that there was a dragon in the story, having seen it in the trailer, but I had never in my wildest imaginings ever considered what an emaciated dragon would or could look like. It was so life like in demeanor and mobility that it elicited sympathy from me. This film as those before it introduced some other mythical creatures, and revisited the Goblins, but I have to say this. I hate to divulge anything that may ruin a film for other viewers, but what I thought was missing were the Centaurs, they were there in the beginning, again in the middle so I thought it only fitting that they should have been there in the end. The absence of the Centaurs did not diminish the quality of this story in any way. This story as written by J.K. Rowling, the screenplay as developed by Steve Kloves, and the direction of David Yates have provided movie goers with an absolute gem. This movie is a perfect example of exceptional fantasy adventure film making. The Boy who lived has taken us on a magical journey that will never be forgotten. I would give this film a double green light if it could make it any clearer that this film is superb.",Null,0,0,2 August 2011
Pitch Perfect," Chix Chat on Film Review: A capella funfest.
","This film shows yet again that anything and everything can be a competition. I have never even thought about a capella singing as a competition, but once I saw the trailer for Pitch Perfect I was immediately interested because of the No Diggity cover. This film just seemed like Bring It On with no cheerleaders, the whole tryout, outlandish rules and the build to the Super Bowl of a capella. The story centers around the freshman year of college for Beca (Anna Kendrick), who is less than thrilled to be on campus. Primarily due to the fact that her Dad is on staff, so we have a sub story of daddy issues, which brought a bit of drama into this comedy. I will say that Ms. Kendrick is a bit of a chameleon, to play a student after playing a business woman in Up In The Air and she can sing. I actually Googled to see if she was lip syncing, she sings. The Treble Makers cover of the Dazz Band's Whip It, was the worse version of the song imaginable. But the Treble Makers were very good at what they did, singing. The film had some really good a capella singing and since the majority of the story was in competition or preparing for competition there was inevitably judging. The banter between the judges Gail (Elizabeth Banks) and John (John Michael Higgins) was too funny mostly because of the clear disdain for each other. There were several players in this film that stood out for various reasons. Chloe (Brittany Snow) and Aubrey (Anna Camp) looked too old to be college students even if they were seniors. Fat Patricia (Rebel Wilson) just kept the funny coming. I didn't realize in what film I had previously seen Ms. Wilson until almost the end of the film that she was in Bridesmaids. I'm sure she will do great things after this, she's very funny and more than anything she seems very comfortable in her own skin. I liked the fact that they didn't do the whole Stomp The Yard final competition and make it a tie, but clearly the story ended with more to tell. I wanted more substance and less regurgitation. After I waited for my No Diggity and it was done, I just didn't have a whole lot to look forward to. This was a fun film, it wasn't bad, so I give it an amber light.",6,1,5,16 October 2012
Godzilla," A Chix Chat On Film Review: Monster for the ages
","Godzilla has been around longer than I have, so I've had the opportunity to see his many incarnations over the years starting with the 1956 King of The Monsters starring Raymond Burr, which I saw many years after it premiered but found it extremely memorable. The trailer for this monster reboot immediately wet my curiosity. The story was obviously going to be done with finesse there seemed to be an air of mystery, and was being told as if it were a serious drama. I've realized that when fictional tales are told with a dramatic flair making the tone more realistic the more serious I take them. Case and point, there was a campiness to the last Godzilla that added to my distaste for it, not to mention his lizard-like appearance, then came this latest offering and I am filled with the same excitement for Godzilla as I remember having as a child. There were some questionable actions and scenes by some of the characters such as Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) having encounter after encounter with skyscraper sized monsters and narrowly escaping with his life just too many times to be believable. The monsters however were absolutely believable, and I have made no secret of the fact that I have a great appreciation for first rate the special effects and in this case they were very worthwhile to watch. I also appreciated the scientific explanation for Godzilla's existence and feeding habits as detailed by Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins). I have to say that I am now looking forward to expansion of the series, with an updated Mothra, Rodan, MechaGodzilla any other combatant for Godzilla and anywhere else the film makers want to take us in the monsterverse. On another note, yes I look for 'Us' in every film, so it was nice to have Captain Russell Hampton (Richard T. Jones) on the job in command and defending the world from the carnage.",8,5,10,19 May 2014
Looper," Chix Chat on Film Review: A very creative loop.
","Looper as seen in the trailer has to do with hit men thirty-two years from now in a future that includes time travel. The thing with time travel that continuously tends to be the case is the probability of a paradox. It always comes down to which came first the chicken or the egg, but this film does a masterful job of taking the audience through a finely crafted tale that is creative, captivating and in some instances just plain sad. Young Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) provides the narrative behind the story so that the audience understands what a looper is and some of the terminology that accompanies the vocation. I say vocation loosely, since it seems that there aren't very many jobs to be had in this future other than crime figure if you're a man, vagrant and working girl. With the narrative we learn that there is the possibility for a closed loop, a running loop, and that the business of being a looper really has very few if any redeeming factors. Old Joe (Bruce Willis) makes the latter aspect of being a looper painfully clear. For a fleeting moment 12 Monkeys came to mind, but the two films have time travel and Bruce Willis in common and nothing else, not that I would mind seeing a crazy eyed Brad Pitt, I digress. Emily Blunt (Sara) does a great job of playing a country girl, she seems to have a knack for taking parts in creative stories. The Adjustment Bureau is one of my favorite movies, for the single fact that it is creative and the story was new. This film was not at all what I expected. It is so refreshing when the trailer doesn't give away all the goods. I had an expectation and I am glad to say that the direction that this film took was nowhere near what I had thought, in fact the trailer was a bit misleading which was an added plus. To say that I was impressed by the writing is to say the very least. I was floored by the writing, the special effects, the shocking manner in which Seth (Paul Dano) was dealt with, and the nose bridge that made J G-L look like BW. There was a time that I was asking myself where is this film going and as each scene unfolded I became more and more engaged. This film was very well done, green light.",9,9,25,28 September 2012
50_50," Chix Chat on Film review: Young man receives a cancer diagnosis.
","Shame on me for expecting a story based on actual events and cancer to be a comedy. After all the film did feature Seth Rogen (Kyle) prominently, he is without a doubt a comedic presence, and he did provide the comic relief for this film. But the film itself was no comedy as was represented by the trailer. I am not a big fan of dramas and no fan at all of cancer, but this film was done very nicely with its handling of the somber subject matter. Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) plays an affable young man who just like most everyone else on the planet is going about living his life, has parents with his mother Diane (Angelica Houston)dealing with age related issues, a best friend from childhood Kyle and a steady girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) when he finds out that he has cancer. I have to say that I agreed inaudibly with every mean spirited derogatory word that Kyle used audibly to describe Rachael. Everything said was exactly how she was portrayed so convincingly and the remarkable thing was that she did not seem to realize what a total bee-otch she was. Who gives a person that is potentially dying and needs to be cared for a dog that seems like it is potentially dying and needs to be cared for? Again this film is based on a true story so I think that Rachael wins the prize for Worst Girlfriend Ever! I digress. It turns out that the type of cancer that Adam has comes with a fifty-fifty chance of him surviving. He actually appears to handle the whole situation fairly well, he begins to follow the prescribed treatment plan and encounters others who are dealing with their own illness. Part of the treatment to aid him in dealing with his diagnosis includes sessions with a therapist. The most interesting dynamic was between Adam and Katherine (Anna Kendrick) as she works on developing a therapist-patient relationship we learn as much about her as a person as we have about Adam. The thing that made this film enjoyable was the fact that it was not just about cancer it was a buddy tale. Would that everyone could have a really good friend like Kyle to be there in one of the toughest times of their life, still when the story began to wind down I found myself asking 'what happens next?', which in part is the reason for the amber light.",Null,0,1,3 October 2011
Cloud Atlas," Chix Chat on Film Review: Reincarnation hyper experience.
","The trailer for Cloud Atlas gave me the impression that this film was an eternal love story played out through reincarnation. Since my favorite reincarnation love story is Dead Again, I was curious to see if this story would be similar and if it would measure up to my expectations. With Tom Hanks and Halle Berry in the lead roles my expectations were high since they typically play in movies that I consider to be remarkable. I was not disappointed. This was not simply a recurring tragic or fulfilled love story, this film was nothing less than remarkable. I mentally segmented the film into three parts. The first part of the film was almost dizzying with the meandering from different points in the past, then to the future and then back to the past. During this first segment we see a menagerie of characters most of which are played by Mr. Hanks and Ms. Berry. A number of times I had to do a double take to be sure of who was playing a specific role, it was much more difficult to recognize Ms. Berry especially in her role as a medical practitioner, Mr. Hanks was always recognizable, but the makeup in all instances was transformative. I have seen characters in films that have been made up as older than they actually are but to see actors made up and actually look authentic as a different race is again remarkable. I would be remiss not to mention the special effects so I will say that the appearance of Neo Seoul was impressive, saying it makes me think of music, I digress. The action and the realization of who everyone truly is in the grand scale of good versus evil is revealed in the second hour, this segment is where most of the aforementioned special effects are delivered. The final hour of the film is where all things culminate and then understanding takes hold. I could talk about all the fine actors who have recurring roles of importance throughout time in this film, but I would spend all my time identifying who they are as portrayed by the actors, which does nothing to underscore how powerful this story is. I believe that any experience that allows for anyone to think in a different way presents growth. That is what Cloud Atlas represents, the very possibility that some causes are so monumental and so significant that they require more than one lifetime to resolve is just remarkable. I give a green light.",9,6,20,27 October 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Chix Chat on Film review: Autobots and Decepticons final battle on earth.
","The final Transformers film Dark of the Moon was no disappointment where action and adventure were concerned, although I must say I thought it to be rather lengthy. I was most impressed by the way history was so eloquently woven into the story, some Forest Gump-like effects were at work, but well done just the same. I have to say that the Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeof) transformation was just as noteworthy as that of the hasbro characters, he has grown up in this role and wears manhood well. He now has a new girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whitely), who I have absolutely nothing against it just felt like the final matrix when the Oracle was replaced. There were some lines to explain the new girl, and maybe that did it for everyone else, but I missed and prefer Mikeala (Megan Fox). And that's as much as I will say about that. There were some new characters added to the list of humans and to the Transformers, most noteworthy on the human side was Dylan (Patrick Dempsey) who was a complete surprise, even with a luminescent smile and an extremely well groomed exterior he was so unlikeable. I liked the fact that this time around a woman was running things, Mearing (Frances McDormand), I did not like the fact that she was so inept at it. Sentinel Prime (Leonard Nimoy) was a cool addition to the Transformers as the former Autobot leader now resurrected. I wondered which came first the homage to Star Trek and then he was cast or if Nimoy was cast and that prompted the homage. This film had some of the best CGI imaginable, but where the special effects were concerned they actually paled to the flying squirrel scenes, those were awesome! There were a lot of exceptional autobot versus decepticon fight scenes, and I must say that Battle: Chicago, was so much better than Battle: LA. All I want to know is when will D-Town get its turn at being digitally pulverized. Our metroplex has some great landmarks that can be torn apart, like the Electric Moon, the rocket shaped building, the green lined building, the AA center and certainly the Cowboys stadium. I want to be able to sit in the theater and say, I was at a game there or I ate there or I used to work there. Since no more Transformers are on the horizon, maybe Dallas will get its turn when giant mutant armadillos roll in. For the fantastic CGI and the fact that you have to see the full set, Transformers gets a green light.",Null,2,6,2 August 2011
