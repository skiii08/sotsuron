It," Not Horrifying
",I just took my family to see IT. The kids were scared while my husband and I kept looking at each other and we were both thinking the same thing that this is like a kids movie. They should have just made it into a cartoon. We were both so hyped up for a good scare instead we got a dancing clown with a baby voice. The kids loved it.,2,35,74,8 September 2017
Deadpool 2," Movie was outstanding as it should be but......
",Took my kids cause well the love Deadpool anyway they didn't get some of the jokes especially one eyed willy and my 13 year old left wanting more. He said the last part was his favorite and adding in the larger kids was crazy. So hopefully next time they can fix the punch lines and the old school jokes. Other then that I'm 36 and I loved it.,10,4,10,19 May 2018
