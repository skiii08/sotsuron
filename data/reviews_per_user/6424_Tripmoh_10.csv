Iron Man 2," a rating for an action movie
",Great movie wonderful visual effects wonderful acting wonderful story line wonderful storytelling wonderful characters just amazing action thriller sci fiction movie with some taste of comedy but just if the movie was longest to preview the story with more details to bring some mystery to the movie and specially that iron man 3 is going they could made the story contain stuff you will never see it coming well i was impressed to see Ivan just distress tony stark every time they meet and to be specific when Ivan says and i quote 'you lose' and the most interested parts in the movie when tony aka iron man goes wild because his life is about to end very great editing and i loved the music and soundtracks in the movie the bullet sounds also the Coalescence between the suits of Ivan and Iron man and war machine,7,2,2,19 April 2013
Fast & Furious 6," Faster Than the rest of the franchise !!!
","This movie was so great maybe the best between the franchise the energy creativity in this movie was not found in the others i enjoyed every single second in the movie,beside for a movie who has explosive and fast cars with fight scenes it had a decent plotbut i won't say anything cause there is some TWIST in the plot i laughed so hard in this movie i would say almost half of the movie was comedynow for the post ending after credits it will grin your ears and make you curious about fast 7 the film deals with criminals world class with great mayhem by their carsIf you are interested by cars and explosive things and comedy with an amount of drama and love plus fight scenes with awesome mayhem F&F 6 is what you are looking forP.S:sorry for my English it's my second language",Null,2,5,8 July 2013

Ant-Man," It's official Marvel turns everything it touches to gold
","Soo Ant-man is another marvel phase 2 movie starring Paul Rudd as Ant-man , who definitely did a great job portraying the hero , and I also like Michel dougles as hank pym cause he was a really good hank pym , aside of the acting the writing was good although it could've been better the premise and concept of the movie is odd yet well executed , cause in the end it is a heist movie starring an ant sized superhero , and I didn't expect the movie to have great action sequences which it did , though sometimes it felt like the bad guys were just faking getting punched or kicked aaand sometimes Ant-man really kicked ass , however you can expect a typical villain who really seems justtt you know clich√©d , anyways I also loved how it ties to the MCU and that one duel between falcon and Scott !! Man that was cool , also this film delivers the usual marvel light tone but also providing emotional and deep moments aand it really really reallyyyy is funny , or maybe its just my sense of humor that is outdatedIn the end Ant-man is must watch movie for marvel fans or superheroes fans in general or anyone that wants to enjoy an amazing action heist movie",7,6,14,18 August 2015
Man of Steel," Superman's best film ever !
","The movie was way better than i expected,zack snyder brought the best action Sci Fi this years,i didn't know to watch either (MAN OF STEEL) or (WORLD WAR Z) but i watched man of steel and it was so good 1.Story line(7):well the story keeps you reacting with the movie and feel the mood it's not the best story although i don't won't to spoil the movie but it is great2.acting(8):the actors played there roles pretty good i was convinced by their acting3:visual effects(10):seriously the visual effects was the brilliant maybe better than iron man 3 effects,it is so good the spaceships,kripton planet the scenes of destruction just perfect if you wanna an action sci fi packed film with good story and that can entertain you for two hours and a half well i recommend man of steel for you P.S:3D version is not so different than 2D so watch it 2D version",7,1,4,22 June 2013
