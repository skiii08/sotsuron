The Blair Witch Project," Terror so real it nearly has a pulse.
","Horror has never been so 'in your face' as it is in the Blair Witch Project. The dizzying first person perspective offered by the hi-8 video and 16mm handi-cams brings the audience nose first into the grainy barren woods. The technique is so effective that I found myself having to take a glance at the theater walls just to remind myself that i wasn't in the Maryland backwoods. The acting, dialogue, and everything else drips with reality which makes you wonder if the film you're watching really isn't the footage discovered beneath that cabin. Most importantly even the horror is real. It exists in myths, legends and historical record of America. The terror is so real it has a pulse. A pulse that quickens with yours as the film culminates in the most frightening five minutes in film history. Real or a figment of ancient fears, the Blair Witch will haunt you long after you've left the theater.",9,1,2,21 July 1999
