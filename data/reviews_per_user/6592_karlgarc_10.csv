Walk the Line," FRUSTRATINGGGGG
","I've only heard of Johnny Cash one other time before watching this movie. In one of Katy Perry's songs, 'The one that got away', to be exact. The plot of the movie is basically that Johnny Cash is in love with June and he will stop at nothing. He wants to spend his days with June rather than with his wife, Vivian.
For the history part of the movie, I feel the clothes they were wearing was very accurate to the time period the movie was portrayed to be in. The time period the movie is set in allowed for the beginning of the rock and roll era, which is not as popular now among current music.
Rock and roll then sounded very different from rock and roll now. It use to be a little more mellow than it is now, in my opinion.
James Mangold is the director of this movie, the only other movie I've watched that was directed by James Mangold as well is Girl interrupted. Girl interrupted and walk the line were both equally good movies in my opinion. The main actors are Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. They both did a good Job with the acting throughout the movie, but they could've done so much better. They've both grown and have starred in much bigger movies. For example Reese Witherspoon in 'legally blond' and Joaquin Phoenix is 'Her.' So good for them. Their acting has definitely improved.
I liked the entire movie over all, what I didn't like was that Johnny was drunk at ALL TIMES POSSIBLE. I think it was annoying if i'm being honest. He would get drunk, act out and then June would have to save him over and over again. I didn't like that he was cheating on his wife and she sort of knew and never directly brought it up, she needed to step up. I didn't like that he stopped talking to his daughters, and started paying lots of attention to Junes' kids for a part of the movie. The only way id watch this movie on my own time would be if someone suggested it, but if it just popped up while I was scrolling I probably would not watch it on my own time.
I would recommend this movie to my friends because it was a good movie, it was just super frustrating to watch Johnny dig himself deep and then having to be dug out by June all the time.",8,0,1,6 February 2019
Miracle," Not the best /:
","The fact that this is a disney movie, you would expect it to be more kiddish. Don't let that throw you off. In my opinion this more of an adult like movie rather than it is a kid one. Only because it's not cartoonized and sportsy, total opposite from other more popular disney movies. The entire plot of the movie is to tell the true story of Herb Brooks a player-turned-coach. He led the 1980´s US olympic team to victory and beat a what seemed to be an invincible Russian squad. It was really, truly, inspiring to watch. This movie did not go into the history as much as I would preferred it to. The little bit of history in this movie is interesting, I just wish they would´ve put more into it. Gavin O´Connor was the director of this movie. He's directed about 16 other movies, Miracle is the only one of them that i've watched so far. The acting in the movie was great, i'm not even gonna lie. The only ´main actor´ that i´ve seen in other movies is Kurt Russell. He's been a part of so many other movies. His acting is really great especially in other movies, or at least I think so. I would not have watched this movie on my own time. Sports movies are really not my personal favorite. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my friends. It's not a bad movie, but it's not great. It was honestly just a little boring to me.",5,0,2,16 May 2019
Captain Phillips," //////:
","One great scene in this movie is the part where Barkhad AbdI says ¨look at me, i´m the captain now.¨ I think this scene is really great because throughout the years I had seen a buttload of memes regarding that phrase, and I never knew where it came from until I watched this movie. The entire plot of the movie is that a container ship sails toward their destination on a day that just seemed like any other regular day. SomalI pirates begin racing toward the ship and try to climb on. The pirates are after millions of dollars and captain phillips is just trying to return everybody on the ship home safely. I genuinely don't know anything related to somalI pirates or anything about this movie and how it connects to history in any way. The history part of the movie was pretty boring in my personal opinion. Paul Greengrass was the director of this movie. The main actors were Tom Hanks, Barkhad Abdi, Faysal Ahmed, & Mahat M. ALi. The only one that i've seen in other movies is Tom Hanks. All of them were amazing actors, but from seeing Hanks in multiple other movies, he´s by far my favorite actor. I liked how the pirates climbed up on the ship. I think they were very clever with how they did it. I didn't like the sound. A Lot of it was just yelling and the sound was awful. It would be super loud one second and then super quiet the next, I don't know if that was the movie or just something on the dvd box, but I didn't like it. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my friends, I thought it was honestly sort of boring.",3,0,1,14 May 2019
42," Amazing!!
","I'm not really a fan of baseball, but 42 was easily one of the best films i've ever watched. One really great scene in the movie was when Ben Chapman was calling Jackie names to make him mad and distract him from winning the game for his team. I think this scene was great because Jackie controlled his temper in such a good way. As heartbreaking as it was to watch him have to take that without being able to do anything about it, it was nice to watch him win and see Ben Chapman and his team lose.
The plot of this movie was that racism was huge in the baseball community. When Ricky hired Jackie to play for the Dodgers it showed that Jackie, a black man, was just as capable, even better at baseball than so many of the white men also playing baseball at the time.
I knew that racism was very big and so real, I just never knew it was a huge problem in sports as well. I thought white men would be happy to win tournaments without the color of one's skin bothering them in any way. Boy was I wrong. Racism isn't too big of a problem anymore. Don't get me wrong, it still very much exists, but it's not as bad as it was years ago.
Brian Helgeland is the director of 42. Other movies directed by Brian Helgeland are: Payback, A knight's tale, The order, and Legend; I have not watched any of those other movies directed by him. I have watched movies he's been in though, such as highway to hell, and A nightmare on elm street (I think 4). I think he's a great actor. Chadwick Boseman did an amazing job, acting wise, as Jackie Robinson.
I liked the acting of most characters in the movie. I loved how much Ricky supported and pushed Jackie to help him succeed in his baseball career. I would have definitely watched this movie on my own time outside of school. I would 10/10 recommend this movie to friends.",10,1,2,6 February 2019
Remember the Titans," loved it
","I can't pick just one favorite scene. The entire movie as a whole was really amazing and inspirational. The plot of the movie was that football is a way of life for some people. The local school board was forced to integrate a black school and a white school. Both of the schools were really passionate about football. Having put both of the high schools together forced them to combine the football teams. Footballs great tradition was put to the test. I knew that schools were segregated, but I didn't know that school boards could force integration amongst a black and a white school. I just thought that progressively white people just started accepting and almost welcoming black people into ¨their¨ areas. I have seen many movies set in this time period. I think every movie i´ve seen regarding segregation has been an awesome movie. In the movie, the boys on the football team got along pretty quickly. I thought that was a little bit weird because usually from what i´ve learned throughout school, it was not rare for whites to be absolute jerks for no apparent reason to POCs. Boaz Yakin was the director of this movie. I wholeheartedly believe that he did a really amazing job in portraying this movie the way that he did. The way he directed the boys in getting along with one another was honestly so beautiful.
I liked how the boys got along rather quickly. I liked how the movie wasn't ALL about the boys and football. They incorporated a couple other things into the movie. I would 10/10 recommend this movie to my friends. This movie was really just amazing.",10,0,1,14 May 2019
Hidden Figures," Women are amazing
","This movie was so good for allowing black women to prove that they can be just as or even smarter than white men. Women in general aren't believed to be able to do much anywhere other than a kitchen; which is absolute bs because women can do everything men can with equal quality or even better most times. But i love how they did not show white women struggling, it was more about how the african american women are not to be put down in any way. They're extremely intelligent, just as anyone else would be if they put effort into it. I knew that african americans were being discriminated against, but considering them working in the same building i didn't think they'd still have it be segregated. It definitely wasn't a harsh movie about segregation, but they did speak up on it and managed to get the 'colored only' signs out in the workplace. The director of this movie is Theodore Melfi. Hidden figures is the only movie i've watched that was directed by Theodore Melfi. It was a really good movie though, i may start looking into more movies he's directed. The main actors are Janelle Monae, Octavia Spencer, and Taraji P Henson along with a bunch of other people. These women are amazing actresses.
I liked how in the end the three girls pursued what they wanted and achieved it. I didn't like how it wasn't as detailed as i expected it to be. I actually watched this movie when it first came out, so yes, i would watch it on my own time. I would recommend this movie to my friends.",9,0,5,8 March 2019
Selma," People can really be so mean
","Selma was a really good movie. One really great scene was where 'Martin Luther King' got the white colored people to help him in the march, then when they were granted entrance into Montgomery, he guided them back because he wanted them to do it all by themselves with no help. The plot of the movie was to show how bad discrimination was that they couldn't even cross over to the town over or whatever because it was pretty much like death for them if they did. I already knew that discrimination was bad. I didn't know it was as bad as they portrayed it in the movie though, maybe worse. But i did grow up watching videos of african americans being beat to death during their peaceful protests in my history classes every once in a while. The history part of the movie was interesting to me. Ava DuVernay is the director of this movie. The only other movie i've watched that she directed was 'A wrinkle in time'. Both Selma and A wrinkle in time are really good movie, and so different from one another. Having watched Selma and A wrinkle in time, ithink im going to have to start watching more movies directed by Ava.
I liked how the whole movie was portrayed. I liked how Martin Luther King wanted no violence at all because he just wanted to be peaceful and let things change naturally with the sympathy of others when watching the people from selma get beaten basically to death. I would have watched this movie on my own time if it came up while i was scrolling through my movie app looking for something to watch. I would 100% recommend this movie to my friends.",10,0,3,8 March 2019
Thirteen Days," Very boring
","I didn't like this movie at all. It wouldn't be fair to say it was a terrible movie, because I didn't pay attention the entire time, but when I did, it was more boring than anything. The plot of this movie was the Cold War. I know that the Cold War was the most dangerous times in world history, as we could've gone into a nuclear war and died. This movie was directed by Roger Donaldson. I liked how the movie was pretty informative about the Cold War as before watching this movie I knew absolutely nothing about it. I just didn't like the movie overall. It's not something I'd sit and watch on my own time. The movie alone wasn't bad, the genre on the other hand isn't my favorite. I don't think I'd recommend this to my friends if they haven't watched it yet.",3,2,10,21 March 2019
Apollo 13," Thrilling
","The best scene in this movie was when one of the guys in the rocket was messing with the buttons and switches trying to fix the problem and when he couldn't he said 'Houston, we have a problem.' The line is just so catchy and universally everyone knows where it came from. It was smart of the director to use this line in the movie. The plot of the movie was that three guys are launched into outer space on Apollo 13 and something goes wrong when they're up in space. On earth, the people at NASA are trying to figure out how to get them back to earth ground safely with little time and oxygen left for them. Apollo 13 was the first ever rocket launch i remember hearing about in elementary school. I knew it was launched in 1970, but in the years 2007- 2009 I remember being talked to about it. I know there's been tons of other rocket launches, but for some reason, that one seemed to be the only one ever talked about in my atmosphere. I've seen other movies of this genre, and they're all really good movies, they just all have the same plot, more or less, and it makes them predictable. Ron Howard is the name of the director for apollo 13. He's also the director for countless other movies. The only other movies i've watched that've been directed by him are: Jay-Z-made in america, The Dilemma,The grinch, The heart of the sea, Inferno, and a beautiful mind. All of which are great movies. The main actors are Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, and Gary Sinise. All have been great actors in other movies they've appeared in. I personally think Tom Hanks was the best actor of all. I'm not sure that i would have watched this movie outside of school only because i'm more into dramatic, sappy, romance movies. I really enjoyed this movie though, it was thrilling and had you on the edge of your seat waiting to see if they'd make it home or not. I would recommend this to my friends. 10/10 amazing movie.",10,1,4,6 May 2019
Back to the Future," Such a fun movie to watch!
","Back to the future is a movie about a teenage boy, Marty McFly, who travels back in time to the 50's using scientist Doc Brown's experiment time machine. He travels through time in a modified DeLorean car. Things go wrong when he finds his parents back in the 50's. He had to make them fall in love with one another so the future goes as planned and he's born. If his parents don't fall in love, he won't exist.
A Lot of the movies made back then that were about teens, look like they've been set in between the 50's-70's. The clothing the people wore back in the movie portraying 50's clothing was, I think, fairly accurate. The clothing style was kind of like bowling meets disco (somewhere in between the two.) Robert Zemeckis was the director of back to the future. He's directed a ton of other movies. I've seen a few of the movies directed by him, but not a lot. I've seen A Christmas Carol, The Polar Express, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and lastly Forrest Gump. They were all super great movies and all so popular, as well as back to the future is. Forrest Gump is easily the best movie i've watched that was directed by Robert. It's more into the genre that I preferably watch whereas all the other ones are more kiddie movies (except for back to the future, that one's kinda for just about anybody, lol). What I liked about this movie was the clothing they wore in the time setting. I love movies with clothing from the 50's all the way to the 2000's really. I love to see the way clothing's changed throughout the years. I would recommend this movie to friends if they have yet to watch it. I loved the movie, always have, always will.",10,0,0,20 March 2019
