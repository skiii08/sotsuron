Catch Me If You Can," Leo Deserves an Oscar
","I'm not a huge fan of Leonardo DiCaprio. But I was really impressed by his performance in this film, even more so than Gangs of New York. I'm really surprised he was not nominated by the Academy. He perfectly captured the character's misfit and yet innocent personality. It would be hard not to be charmed by him. The film was witty and it didn't bore me for one second. As always, Tom Hanks was fabulous, as well as Chris Walken. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE!! Grade A",10,1,2,2 October 2003
