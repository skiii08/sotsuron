The Avengers," Good
","This is one of the bleakest films I have seen in a long time. All characters are unhappy souls, surviving in a grim world, unable to improve their lot, prone to an almost genetically determined urge to mess things up. They have egos and the big guns aren't used to working with other people or playing by the rules (talking about you, Thor!). The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. The acting is very effective. It's an amazing work and everything I had hoped for. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them.",7,0,2,18 August 2014
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Good
","Right from the opening scene I knew I wasn't going to be disappointed. The action, special effects, acting, comedy and romance were all better than the original, in my opinion. The plot was a little confusing, but all in all it was an extremely fun and enjoyable movie. I actually found myself watching it four times in a row. I probably could have watched it 24 hours straight, but I didn't want to ruin it right away, you know? This cast interacts with absolute precision, whether walking around a room or interrupting each others' wisecracks. The script and direction meld into a strong movie. What's best is that not one character ever withdraws tongue from cheek. I give it a final rating of 7/10.",7,0,0,5 September 2014
Million Dollar Arm," Good
","This kind of unsentimental character piece needs a tight focus so all of the nuances of said characters shine through. Well, the characters in this film have a lot of depth and the realism with which they are portrayed by the actors is shocking at times. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. Hamm is one of the world's supreme artistic talents and he should do more serious work than any other movie star. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect.",7,0,2,18 August 2014
Gremlins," Good
","I wasn't really sure if I'd like the movie. It's a film that fails to take advantage of its cool premise, that makes you wish they had done better rather than spoiling a good idea. A boy inadvertently breaks three important rules concerning his new pet and unleashes a horde of malevolently mischievous monsters on a small town. This is well worth seeing. With a little more life this would have been a great movie. There isn't much else to say besides, go see it for yourself! I thought this film was fantastic in some ways and terrible in others. The flow of the plot is painfully cliché, up until the end where things are pretty unpredictable. I was lucky enough to see this film for free on television.",7,0,1,30 August 2014
The Incredible Hulk," Good
","After reading the reviews on here I wasn't put off watching this film. Bruce Banner, a scientist on the run from the U.S. Government must find a cure for the monster he emerges whenever he loses his temper. However, Banner then must fight a soldier whom unleashes himself as a threat stronger than he. As another reviewer put it, if you don't walk out of this film screaming HELLL YEAAAA, then you are not normal. Granted, most supporting characters were one-dimensional. The last fight scene is just phenomenal. There isn't much else to say besides, go see it for yourself! I give this one a rating of seven out of ten stars.",7,0,0,30 August 2014
Lucky Number Slevin," Good
","Dysfunctional families live in decaying shacks, without money or food. Violent dogs are barking everywhere. The only thing that keeps it afloat is the sensitivity of the bilaterally desperately needy relationship between the leads. This is essentially a straightforward black comedy of errors. The body count climbs steadily as the movie progresses. Unfairly dismissed by some as confusing. The main characteristic of the film is the gloomy atmosphere, emphasizing the desolate hopelessness. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. The acting is very effective. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect.",7,0,2,18 August 2014
Captain Phillips," Good
","Say hello to the true story of Captain Richard Phillips and the 2009 hijacking by Somali pirates of the US-flagged MV Maersk Alabama, the first American cargo ship to be hijacked in two hundred years. Hanks carries this movie and saves it from being a disaster. The film is dark, brooding, intense; it is hard to watch at times and difficult to call enjoyable, but the story is still powerful. The trains of righteousness can't be stopped and their movement brings about reactive forces in the people they affect. A masterful work that imbues you to it through its realism. Great performances help to enhance this amazing story.",7,0,1,19 August 2014
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good
","It's the best outer space film yet. Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace was well-received at its American premiere. While there is some strong personality being displayed, it is done in a way that is truthful to human nature. I found the film a little too dark and a little too slow as it moves to what seems like an inevitable, bitter end. The film is more than just a glimpse into the life of a man who does know how to live, but I was wondering if he served more as a metaphor for everyone of us as a part of the human race who live better when we're on a leash. It is a powerful film, but I doubt I will ever watch it again.",7,0,2,22 August 2014
The Expendables 2," Good
","A masterful work that imbues you to it through its realism. The film is dark, brooding, intense and most of all depressing. It is hard to watch at times and difficult to call enjoyable, but the story is still powerful. Stallone's is not the restrained performance that the critics have described. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. The trains of violence can't be stopped and their incessant movement brings about reactive forces in the people it affects. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them.",7,0,1,18 August 2014
50 First Dates," Good
","We've seen these clichéd characters a million times. Henry Roth is a man afraid of commitment up until he meets the beautiful Lucy. They hit it off and Henry think he's finally found the girl of his dreams, until he discovers she has short-term memory loss and forgets him the very next day. The directing, music, editing, etc are not focused on at all. Overall, the film was...'eh'. Sorry Sandler, but almost every joke in this movie is absolutely pointless. Nothing to laugh at, yet heartfelt from the first frame to the last. The kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. My rating: 7/10.",7,1,1,22 August 2014
Ghost," Good
","The setup: After being killed during a botched mugging, a man's love for his partner enables him to remain on earth as a ghost.The verdict: Strong cast pulls the most out of mediocre material. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. The kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. If you can find it on DVD or Bluray for under $8, buy it, but it won't be worth much more than that to you because it's a bit outdated.",7,1,2,19 August 2014
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Good
","I watched E.T. yesterday and let me tell you: this movie rocks! The first co-leading partnership between Thomas/E.T. makes for a great flick.It's a very good story, a very cool villain, good dramatic scenes and a perfect chemistry between the two action stars! The supporting cast is one of the many highlights of this movie.It's good and funny. The plot is intelligent, I liked it. It's not a remake of any kind, of course you know the end or you can predict some of the turnouts. But, overall it is fun and intelligent.For alien fans and people who want to forget their lives for a couple of hours and have a film fun, I highly recommend it! Awesome!",7,0,1,6 September 2014
Friday Night Lights," Good
","Based on H.G. Bissinger's book, which profiled the economically depressed town of Odessa, Texas and their heroic high school football team, The Permian High Panthers. I could've cared less what happened to these characters because there was no depth to them and I didn't feel attached to them at all. Football fans will like it. We've seen these clichéd characters a million times. These are the only things to critique on. The directing, music, editing, etc. are not very focused on at all here. Overall, the film was, I would say, 'eh'. I was bored through most of it and I left the theater with no intentions to ever see it again.",7,0,0,22 August 2014
Wayne's World," Good
","Funny, lame and stupid! Really, Wayne's World manifests such a bad feeling that it thrusts trough your face and then to your brain, and both hurt badly! It is boring, slow, predictable and so on with negativity. The story is lame. Probably the best thing in whole film was the post-sex scene! The post-sex scene between Mike Meyers and Tia Carriere was more than impressive. They did it without a double. When I saw this film, I didn't have a clue that is about the SNL skit. The big weak spot of this film is low budget, but try not to pay attention and enjoy the film. A pure fiasco! When I was a kid, I was very happy when I found out that there's a sequel to the first film.",7,0,0,30 August 2014
Unbreakable," Good
","There is simply so much to love about this movie. An intelligent script, with direction that does it justice. Even all the side characters are brilliantly played. This movie never grabbed the public's attention the way it should have. It's a film that reeks of its time and place. The first 34 minutes of the running time are particularly hard to endure. . I'm not sure whether it is really a guilty pleasure or simply a film I remember as being one. So why do I like it so much? The characters are wonderful in the movie. The film unfolds in two halves. I remember watching this and being spellbound by the last third of the movie.",7,0,1,5 September 2014
As Good as It Gets," Good
","I thought this was cute and not bad. AS GOOD AS IT GETS stars Mr. Jack Nicholson, an American actor, producer, screenwriter and director of some acclaim. The only thing that keeps it afloat is the sensitivity of the bilaterally desperately needy relationship between the characters. The characters in this film have a lot of depth and the realism with which they are portrayed by the actors is shocking at times. It is hard to describe life. Stories about mutants fighting wars in different galaxies, that is easy to describe; but writing about life, sometimes all you can say is, 'It's about life.' And so I award this movie 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,30 August 2014
The Hunger Games," Good
","Great performances help enhance this amazing story of friendship. Katniss Everdeen voluntarily takes her younger sister's place in the Hunger Games, a televised fight to the death in which two teenagers from each of the twelve Districts of Panem are chosen at random to compete. I thought that there was really good chemistry between the main characters. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. I am not saying the film is a classic, but it was pleasant.",7,0,3,22 August 2014
Batman Returns," Good
","Batman Returns was well-received in its American premiere. The film is dark, brooding, intense and most of all depressing. One knows from the start that there is no way for it to really end well. I found the film a little too dark and a little too slow as it moves to what seems like an inevitable bitter end. I think it could use some editing to speed the pace a bit. The film is hard to watch at times and difficult to call enjoyable, but the story is still powerful. It is difficult to imagine that such a dark film will attain much cinematic success. It is a powerful film, but I doubt I will ever want to watch it again. With this culture of ignorance in the Information Age persisting, fed by the corporate media, Michael Keaton has appeared in one of his best films yet, and in one that brings humanity down to its root nature.",7,2,7,21 August 2014
Superbad," Good
","It's the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. There were so many hilarious one-liners in the film that I will need to watch it again to see which ones I missed while I was laughing. This kind of unsentimental character piece needs a small tight focus so all of the nuances of the characters shine through. Michael Cera was great, and most should find his performance here just as entertaining as his take on George Michael. Hill's depiction of Southern lower class Americana is unsentimental, austere and straightforward. Jonah Hill is the funniest he has ever been. Heartfelt and riveting from the first frame to the last.",7,0,1,18 August 2014
Juno," Good
","This is another level of film, heartfelt and riveting from the first frame to the last. The characters in this film have a lot of depth. Faced with an unplanned pregnancy, an offbeat young woman makes an unusual decision regarding her unborn child. It's the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. This film is worthy of all the hopes you have. I am not saying the film is a classic, but it was pleasant. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. Original to the tenth degree, it gets 7/10 in my books.",7,0,2,23 August 2014
Midnight in Paris," Good
","What a concept. While on a trip to Paris with his fiancée's family, a nostalgic screenwriter finds himself mysteriously going back to the 1920s every day at midnight. Unfairly dismissed by some, this is a funny sex comedy. . It's not the thing to see if you're in the mood for something uplifting, or something with tons of action. The film is more than just a glimpse into the life of a man who does know how to live, but I was wondering if he served more as a metaphor for everyone of us as a part of the human race who live better when we're on a leash. I give it a final rating of 7 out of 10 because it's good but also kind of flawed.",7,0,0,22 August 2014
Crash," Good
","The setup: Los Angeles citizens with vastly separate lives collide in interweaving stories of race, loss and redemption.The verdict: This is another level of film. I can watch this film over and over again. All through the movie, there are moments where you fear that its makers are going to settle for the cliché, but you know what? They never do. This is a story about a place most people might not be able to conceive. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. It's not the thing to see if you're in the mood for something uplifting, or something with tons of thrills and action, but it is solid.",7,0,2,23 August 2014
The Beach," Good
","A young man named Richard travels to Thailand and finds himself in possession of a strange map. Rumors state that it leads to a solitary beach paradise, a tropical bliss - excited and intrigued, he sets out to find it. The kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. That said, the main plot of the film was constantly being interrupted. I thought that there was really good chemistry between the actors. It will either surprise or disappoint you, depending on what your expectations are. Still, it's a film BOTH genders can enjoy. Find it today, even if you don't like this type of movie.",7,0,2,22 August 2014
The Book Thief," Good
","The setup: While subjected to the horrors of World War II Germany, young Liesel finds solace by stealing books and sharing them with others. In the basement of her home, a Jewish refugee is being sheltered by her adoptive parents.The verdict: Quality work that draws you in and doesn't let you go. The content isn't for everyone. It is difficult to watch and has no shortage of abuse and neglect. There are slow spots, but to me the movie is too good to dismiss based on them. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect.",7,0,2,30 August 2014
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Good
","Captain America again has a shield the size of a large pizza. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods, and there are fisticuffs back and forth. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. This is a gritty, hard movie about gritty hard people, but it's also intelligent, heartfelt and riveting. The characters in this film have a lot of depth and the realism with which they are portrayed by the actors is shocking at times.",7,0,3,18 August 2014
Rocky II," Good
","Rocky struggles in family life after his bout with Apollo Creed, while the embarrassed champ insistently goads him to accept a challenge for a rematch. It's the best boxing film yet, but there is more to it than just the sport. Are there annoying things in this movie? Yes, like the overdone acting. But the movie has enough to keep you entertained. Stallone is good when he is bad and good when he is good, so no point in dwelling on him. From an artistic standpoint, there were some story elements I didn't think were needed. This is the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. My overall rating: 7/10.",7,1,1,22 August 2014
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Good
","This is a story about a place most people might not be able to conceive. This film has a feel; you can sense it and I was getting a little shaky halfway through. It's fun watching it. In its category it is amongst the best. I was impressed. It's an amazing work and everything I had hoped for. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. There are slow spots, but to me the movie is too good to dismiss based on them. Some great costumes and dialog move it all along. The real centerpiece of the film is its acting. It reminds me of French movies where it's more about the characters and their environment.",7,7,11,22 August 2014
Forrest Gump," Good
","I just saw this one. Though it was corny and I can see why many disliked it, I couldn't stop laughing. Whether the jokes were good or bad, I laughed and that is good enough for me to call it good. I was surprised as well by how well done it was. The quality was excellent. I guess if I was in a bad mood, this movie wouldn't be half as good, but I thought it to be enjoyable and would recommend it for the parents and kids to enjoy. Granted, everything in it is historically incorrect but that's the fun part! I give Tom Hanks a lot of credit for making this a good flick, but I wouldn't go so far as to say it was the best movie of all time and a beautiful piece of art, but a movie doesn't have to be beautiful to be good.",7,3,5,4 September 2014
Captain America: The First Avenger," Good
","It's 'Die Hard' for the comic book crowd. Captain America has a shield the size of a large pizza but kicks some major buttocks. I love the fisticuffs back and forth. The story is well told and gives you a good idea of how a boy named Steve becomes the hero. The characters in this film have a lot of depth and the realism with which they are portrayed by the actors is surprising at times. As is often the came with comic book movies, from an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them.",7,0,1,19 August 2014
The Godfather: Part II," Good
","I know that there has to be some justice in this life, so everyone will pay for their sins and crimes someday. I shudder when I think what will happen to these folks for killing the 'Godfather' franchise. 'Part III' is a shame of a movie, but NOTHING compared to what this piece of garbage is. The other two movies acknowledged that killing or hurting people was a conscious choice that was painfully taken; in this one it is as if violence was fun and part of life. There are so many wrong things about this film it is useless to count them. What a disgrace of a movie. This doesn't even qualify as 'so bad it is good'. This is merely 'so bad it is bad'. 7/10.",7,0,4,23 August 2014
10 Things I Hate About You," Good
","For some reason or another, certain movies achieve a reputation as being worse than they actually are. This one tries to be down-to-earth. A new kid must find a guy to date the meanest girl in school, the older sister of the girl he has a crush on, who cannot date until her older sister does. Granted, there is some cheese on display here. The music is dated and some of the dialogue is just too obvious. Nevertheless, there's good stuff here. OK, there are some flaws and I am not too naive to suggest this movie is worthy of an Oscar. My advice would be to watch this movie in full before you judge it. It shows how wrapped up we can become when trying to achieve our goals through others and how it affects people around us.",7,0,0,23 August 2014
Léon: The Professional," Good
","Here's the scene: All characters are unhappy souls, surviving in a grim world, unable to improve their lot, with violent dogs barking everywhere. A gritty, hard movie about gritty hard people. This film is dark, brooding, intense; it is hard to watch at times and difficult to call enjoyable, but the story is still powerful. The trains of righteousness can't be stopped and their movement brings about reactive forces in the people they affect. I know places and people that might pass for the world in this movie. I have witnessed people fall apart because of those around them. The acting is effective. This is the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. Rent it!",7,0,0,19 August 2014
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Good
","This film was nearly perfect, but sadly still not made for everyone. It's an important film, as well as very entertaining. It is very light-hearted and it isn't complex at all as all the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated many falsehoods. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose. A true gem in which the only thing that keeps it afloat is the sensitivity of the desperately needy relationship between the characters.

Radio," Good
","This is the kind of low-budget film that truly proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. Radio is the story of a high school coach and the developmentally challenged man whom he takes under his wing. This film is worthy of all the hopes you have. All of the fancy characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. The plot is not as well thought out as the original, but it still does the cast well. It's an important film. Great performances help to enhance this amazing story of friendship, but the real centerpiece of the film is its acting. It's fun watching it.",7,0,0,22 August 2014
28 Weeks Later," Good
","So let me get this straight: Six months after the rage virus was inflicted on the population of Great Britain, the US Army helps to secure a small area of London for the survivors to repopulate and start again. But not everything goes to plan. Okay, got it. I thought that there was really good chemistry between the two main characters. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. A true gem. A gritty, hard movie about gritty, hard people, but it's also intelligent. I am not saying the film is a classic, but it was pleasant.

The Village," Good
","I will never understand the hate for this movie. I found the acting to be sensational, the dialogue incredible and the director's abilities to be up to par and then some. It reminds me of some of those sombre Chinese films that were popular back in the 1990. My girlfriends and I were so excited to see this movie, thinking it was going to be a fun movie. Characters start to make bad decisions and one thing leads to another and so on. In the end, what the audience gets is a casserole of movie elements and little of the satisfaction that comes from watching these types of movies. I decide to give it 7 out of 10, higher than it deserves but still somewhat warranted.",7,1,2,28 August 2014
Cold Mountain," Good
","I actually found myself watching it four times in a row. I probably could have watched it 24 hours straight, but I didn't want to ruin it right away, you know? In the waning days of the American Civil War, a wounded soldier embarks on a perilous journey back home to Cold Mountain, North Carolina to reunite with his sweetheart. So what do we get? We get sludge. You can tell that everybody in this movie knew that it was a stinker, so why try? Maybe the worst thing about this movie is that deep down, beneath the bad acting and the awful script, there were some okay ideas. Right from the opening scene I knew I wasn't going to be disappointed.",7,0,0,5 September 2014
Heartbreak Ridge," Good
","Ain't no such thing as too much Clint Eastwood, baby. A hard-nosed, hard-living Marine gunnery sergeant clashes with his superiors and his ex-wife as he takes command of a spoiled recon platoon with a bad attitude. The real centerpiece of the film is its acting, mainly that of Eastwood. I like this type of film, as it reminds me of German movies where it's more about the characters and their environment. Great performances help to enhance this amazing story of warfare and courage. I give it a rating of 7 out of 10 because it's flawed but good. Watch for Eastwood's best performance of the 1980s in this 1986 film.",7,0,2,29 August 2014
Silver Linings Playbook," Good
","Its complexity begins within its characters. After a stint in a mental institution, former teacher Pat Solitano moves back in with his parents and tries to reconcile with his ex-wife. The content isn't for everyone. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. The movie has enough to keep you entertained and the directing and cinematography are well done. A little too slow-paced for a film. The urge to just walk away almost got me a couple of times. But, in the end, this is an excellent character study.",7,0,2,19 August 2014
Rocky IV," Good
","After Drago, an intimidating 6-foot-5, 261-pound Soviet boxer, literally destroys Creed in an exhibition match, Rocky goes to the heart of Russia for 15 pile-driving boxing rounds of revenge. Stallone is a unique presence in North American cinema and hopefully will do more of these kinds of austere, gripping character pieces in the future. The film's screenplay is tight and well-written, and it's the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. Unfairly dismissed by some as confusing. Its complexity begins within its characters. It's an amazing work, everything I had hoped for.",7,2,3,22 August 2014
Bad Teacher," Good
","Everything about this film could make anyone laugh. Could. A lazy, incompetent middle school teacher who hates her job and her students is forced to return to her job to make enough money for a boob job after her rich fiancé dumps her. An intelligent script, with direction that does it justice. It's a film that fails to take advantage of its cool premise, that makes you wish they had done better rather than spoiling a good idea. It's not funny and the actors look bored. Still, I thought this was cute and not bad at all. There are slow spots, but to me the movie is too good to dismiss based on them. As a final rating, I receives 7 out of 10.",7,2,4,30 August 2014
Saw III," Good
","It manages to explain events in Saw 1 and 2 that may have been considered plot holes. It's the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. It's not perfect, though. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. Some of the dialog could be better. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. This is probably the worst of the sequels, with nothing to laugh at.

Batman Begins," Good
","The image of Gotham City this film paints, is dire. Dysfunctional families live in decaying shacks, without money or food. Violent dogs are barking everywhere. Disagreements are settled by fistfights or, in some cases, by bullets. The film is more than just a glimpse into the life of a man who does know how to live, but I was wondering if he served more as a metaphor for everyone of us as a part of the human race who live better when we're on a leash. Batman doesn't like being messed with, especially when nobody has a reason to mess with him. He doesn't give them one, but when he fights back at them, the consequences are played out throughout the film. The editing lets the actors breathe and the music lets the atmosphere live.",7,1,2,21 August 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Good
","This is another level of animated film. The depiction of Southern lower class Americana is unsentimental, austere and straightforward, but the real centerpiece of the film is its acting. The characters in this film have a lot of depth and the realism with which they are portrayed by the actors is shocking at times. This film is worthy of all the hopes you have. The only thing that keeps it afloat is the sensitivity of the bilaterally desperately needy relationship between the characters. DeBlois has told us a moving story that won't be soon forgotten. Great performances help to enhance this amazing story of a friendship between a dragon, a young man and you.",7,2,7,18 August 2014
The Number 23," Good
","The setup: On his birthday, Walter Sparrow, an amiable dog-catcher, takes a call that leaves him dog bit and late to pick up his wife. She's browsed in a bookstore, finding a blood-red-covered novel, a murder mystery with numerology that loops constantly around the number 23. The story captivates Walter: he dreams it, he notices aspects of his life that can be rendered by '23,' he searches for the author, he stays in the hotel (in room 23) where events in the novel took place, and he begins to believe it was no novel. His wife and son try to help him, sometimes in sympathy, sometimes to protect him. Slowly, with danger to himself and to his family, he closes in on the truth.The verdict: Suitably creepy and worth your time!",7,1,1,6 September 2014

Against this backdrop, our hero must fight. The acting is very effective. I finished this film, thinking, 'There are people out there suffering and I can do something to help them out.'

X-Men: The Last Stand," Good
","In some ways the best in the series; in some ways the worst. When a cure is found to treat mutations, lines are drawn amongst the X-Men, led by Professor Charles Xavier, and the Brotherhood, a band of powerful mutants organized under Xavier's former ally, Magneto. You could say that the film is built on a firm base, but it's also one big pile of self-obsession. It holds the attention but demands complete suspension of logic. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them.",7,1,1,29 August 2014
Good Will Hunting," Good
","Unfairly dismissed by some as confusing, this kind of sentimental character piece needs a tight focus so all of the nuances of the characters shine through. The characters in this film have a lot of depth and the realism with which they are portrayed by the actors is shocking at times. The acting is very effective. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. Williams is one of the world's supreme artistic talents.

Driven," Good
","I'm DRIVEN to love this! There is simply so much to love about this movie. I've been waiting to see this for so many years, I can't express how happy I am to finally see it. An intelligent script, with direction that does it justice. Even all the side characters are brilliantly played. This movie never grabbed the public's attention the way it should have. It's a film that reeks of its time and place. The first 38 minutes of the running time are particularly hard to endure. . I'm not sure whether it is really a guilty pleasure or simply a film I remember as being one. So why do I like it so much? The characters are wonderful in the movie. The film unfolds in two halves. I remember watching this and being spellbound by the last third of the movie. 7/10.",7,1,3,6 September 2014
Ghostbusters," Good
","I like all of the comedians in Ghostbusters. One could say that Ghostbusters is built on a firm base. The acting is very effective. This film was nearly perfect, but sadly still not made for everyone. It's an important film, as well as very entertaining. It starts in New York City. A gritty, hard movie about gritty hard people, but it's also intelligent. Sounds corny? It's meant to be goofy. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed.

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Good
","This film is not to be missed. It is a masterpiece full of poignancy and beauty. I urge you to see it with an open mind. Pitt is good when he is bad and good when he is good, so no point in dwelling on him. This is the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. Pitt is a unique presence in North American cinema and hopefully will do more of these kinds of austere, gripping character pieces in the future. The film's screenplay is tight and well-written, and worthy of praise. Its complexity begins within its characters. It's a great work, everything I had hoped for in fact. 7/10.",7,0,1,30 August 2014
Million Dollar Baby," Good
","It's never boring. Eastwood is good when he is bad and good when he is good, so no point in dwelling on him. It's worth watching this movie just to see him. Here he has chosen to make a heart-felt, character-driven film. All of the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. It's not the thing to see if you're in the mood for something uplifting, or something with tons of action. But it is a true gem in which the only thing that keeps it afloat is the sensitivity of the desperately needy relationship between the characters. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. A gritty, hard movie about gritty, hard people.",7,2,4,22 August 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Good
","I finished this film, thinking, 'There are people out there suffering and I can do something to help them out.' This is a story about a place most people might not be able to conceive: where things are dying, where people survive off liquor and stale food, where those who are supposed to love us drive knives into our backs. There are fisticuffs back and forth with those who claim to work for justice. The film is dark, brooding, intense and most of all depressing. Great performances help to enhance this amazing story of friendship and violence. It's an amazing work and everything I had hoped for. A masterful work that imbues you to it through its realism.",7,0,3,19 August 2014
Caddyshack," Good
","I could've cared less what happened to these characters because there was no depth to them and I didn't feel attached to them at all. Characters start to make bad decisions and one thing leads to another and so on. You get the idea. It's not funny and the actors look bored. You'll be bored. Chase is awful and looks silly. Still, I thought this was cute and not bad. I thought that there was really good chemistry between the main characters. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed.

","Johnny Depp does a good job of playing a weirdo, but he's too Michael Jackson-like for my liking. I thought this was cute and not bad at all. Filled with charm, innocence and drama.

Stu's plan for a subdued pre-wedding brunch, however, goes seriously awry. The writing is meant to make us all laugh and succeeds. It's an important film, as well as very entertaining. It's meant to be goofy.If you end up watching this, you will probably be like me in saying that it starts off great then gradually begins to suck. It holds the attention but demands complete suspension of logic.From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed.

Against this backdrop, our hero must fight. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed.

Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Good
","This is probably the worst of the sequels, with nothing to laugh at. The story is well told and gives you a good idea of how a boy named Kevin becomes the hero. It manages to explain events in part 1 that may have been considered plot holes. Stern stole the show for his portrayal of the burglar, I thought. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. My only problem with the film was the supporting cast, but it's still okay. Some of the dialog could be better. The real centerpiece of the film is its acting.",7,1,2,19 August 2014
National Treasure," Good
","This is a great film with a tone reminiscent of other great films. The film builds up suspense in the beginning and then takes off. Anyone else really enjoy it? It just became available at Blockbuster. I hadn't known the name of the film or its stars. An excellent and difficult production, bolstered by great performances. A poignant, gripping story that glues you to your seat from the start to the end. The movie itself is nothing that special, but it has some good stuff. The major players are excellent. The comedy elements are unfortunate as they usually are in films like these. My husband and I laughed out loud dozens of time while watching it. This cast interacts with absolute precision. 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,5 September 2014
Rocky," Good
","The setup: Rocky Balboa, a small-time boxer gets a supremely rare chance to fight the heavy-weight champion, Apollo Creed, in a bout in which he strives to go the distance for his self-respect.The verdict: It's 'Die Hard' for the boxing crowd as Rocky kicks some major buttocks. I love the fisticuffs back and forth. It is somewhat light-hearted and it isn't complex at all as all the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated many falsehoods. This film was nearly perfect, but sadly still not made for everyone. Oh, and the acting is very effective, save for a couple of scenes. A true gem from the '70s.",7,0,1,19 August 2014
Pulp Fiction," Good
","Welcome to the world of Pulp Fiction, where dysfunctional families live in decaying shacks and violent dogs are barking everywhere. It's a world where the only thing that keeps lives afloat is the sensitivity of the bilaterally desperately needy relationships on display. Against this backdrop, our heroes must fight. Pulp Fiction is one of those roller-coasters that is both a joy and a trial to watch. I am not saying the film is a classic, but it was pleasant. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. Original and unforgettable to the tenth degree.",7,0,1,19 August 2014
The Da Vinci Code," Good
","There ain't no such thing as too much Tom Hanks, baby. The real centerpiece of the film is its acting, mainly that of Tom Hanks. I really like this type of film, as it reminds me of French movies where it's more about the characters and their environment. One of the best dramas I've seen and a step up for the cast. This is a story about a place most people might not be able to conceive. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. Against this backdrop, our hero must fight on.

","Stallone is good when he is bad and good when he is good, so no point in dwelling on him. Rocky has been holding the title as the heavyweight champion until he is defeated by a brutal challenger, and now must regain his fighting spirit through a big rematch, trained by an unlikely ally: his old nemesis Apollo Creed. This is the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. This is probably the worst of the sequels. By this film the series became even more unwatchable and somehow even more redundant. This is one of those movies that the star isn't only in for the paycheck. I give it a rating of 7/10.",7,1,2,28 August 2014
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Good
","Talk about magic! Dan Radcliffe's progression is amazing in this film. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. This is another level of film. The film is dark, brooding, intense. Great performances help to enhance this amazing story of friendship and magic. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. The urge to just walk away almost got me a couple of times. But, in the end, this is an excellent character study. Indeed the characters in this film have a lot of depth and the realism with which they are portrayed by the actors is shocking at times.",7,0,1,19 August 2014

Harry decides to ignore Dobby's warning and continues with his pre-arranged schedule. But at Hogwarts, strange and terrible things are indeed happening: Harry is suddenly hearing mysterious voices from inside the walls, muggle-born students are being attacked, and a message scrawled on the wall in blood puts everyone on his/her guard - 'The Chamber Of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies Of The Heir, Beware.' The verdict: Great storyline and acting!",7,0,2,6 September 2014
Die Hard," Good
","The setup: John McClane, officer of the NYPD, tries to save wife Holly Gennaro and several others, taken hostage by German terrorist Hans Gruber during a Christmas party at the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles.The verdict: The film has good structure. The characters are all cardboard, with the exception of John McClane (Bruce Willis of 'Moonlighting' fame). Bruce Willis plays McClane to a hilt. John McClane is a man who puts his job as a policeman above all else. There are a lot of good action scenes, and fisticuffs. All in all, I give this 1988 movie a rating of seven out of ten for its action and humor sequences.",7,1,3,30 August 2014
When Harry Met Sally...," Good
","When Harry Met Sally... a bunch of stuff happened. The real centerpiece of the film is its acting, mainly Billy Crystal's (it's fun seeing him as a hunky ladies' man). From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. This is not a great movie, but the cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect.

Zero Dark Thirty," Good
","In its category it is amongst the best even though it is difficult to watch and has no shortage of violence, abuse and neglect. As another reviewer stated, Zero Dark Thirty is the type of film that needs good writing to work, because it's about a long process mainly done by people sitting at desks. Many scenes do not feel believable. But great performances help to enhance this amazing story. This is one of those movies that the cast isn't only in for the paycheck. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods, and there are verbal fisticuffs back and forth. There are slow spots, but to me the movie is too good to dismiss based on them.",7,3,7,19 August 2014
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Good
","I thought this was cute and not bad. McClane and a store owner are targeted by a terrorist in New York City, where he plans to rob the Federal Reserve Building. One could say that the film is built on a firm base, that the acting is very effective and that the people who put this one together really knew what they were doing. In the end, the audience gets a casserole of film elements and little of the satisfaction that comes from watching these types of movies. I refuse to totally dismiss this, because I find it quite engaging, in a guilty pleasure sense. This is one of those movies that had bad timing when it came to its release.",7,1,2,22 August 2014
Jaws," Good
","JAWS was rightfully one of the year's most critically acclaimed movies and the recipient of an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. It's the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. Roy Scheider is wonderful as cop Martin Brody, who has relocated to a coastal island town. The screenplay is tight and well-written. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed.

The Shawshank Redemption," Good
","My advice would be to watch this movie in full before you judge it. Actually, the movie itself is nothing special, but it has some good stuff. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do, however, drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. The leads' combined talents and charisma have a lot to do with this movie's success. I found the acting to be sensational, the dialogue incredible and the director's abilities to be up to par and then some. It reminds me of some of those Croatian films that were popular back in the 1990s. My final rating comes in at seven out of 10 stars.",7,0,0,4 September 2014
Space Jam," Good
","The setup: Basketball icon Michael Jordan agrees to help the Looney Tunes play a basketball game versus alien slavers to determine their freedom.The verdict: I am aware of much of the criticism around this movie, claiming it is awful and not worth seeing. To all those who have said these things, I just have to ask: What movie were you watching? With style, charm, and humor to spare, this film was among the top echelon of movies from 1996. I laughed and was moved and all of that good stuff. At the end of the day, it's a fun, entertaining blockbuster, so 7/10.",7,3,4,30 August 2014
Saving Mr. Banks," Good
","Quickly rushed into production but still solid thanks to Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks is good when he is bad and good when he is good. It's worth watching this movie just to see Tom Hanks. Other thank Tom Hanks, the real centerpiece of the film is its acting; three performances in particular stick out. The movie is very light-hearted and it isn't complex at all. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed.

Live Free or Die Hard," Good
","The story is nothing special, but exceptional performances from most of the cast go a long way. McClane and a young hacker join forces to take down master cyber-terrorist who likes evil. The cinematography is stark and bare. It's fun watching it because its complexity begins within its characters. This is one of those movies that Willis isn't only in for the paycheck. Are there annoying things in this movie? Yes, like the overdone dialog and attempts and comic relief. I don't care what they say, Willis is a unique presence in American cinema and hopefully will do more of these kinds of austere, gripping character pieces more often in the future. The screenplay is tight and well-written, and it's the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one.",7,2,3,21 August 2014
Lucy," Good
","Yes, this does remind me a lot of Deja Vu. The comparisons are obvious, and just like that film, I like it enough, but I don't think it's great or all that really good. In some ways it is the most ridiculous thing I've seen in years. Some of the dialog could be better. The real centerpiece of the film is its acting. This is the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one.

A Nightmare on Elm Street," Good
","The film is more of a clichéd yarn than a story about nightmares. Generally the film is a might-have-been. True, it has its moments, but things are pretty tame. The film unfolds in two halves. There are some nightmarish moments but they are too briefly seen. There are gaping plot holes. Can anyone work out what's going on? What really lets this film down is its weak ending. Surely the script-writers could have come up with a better ending than this. Even all the side characters are brilliantly played. I also find this movie being really creepy sometimes, what is not usual for slasher films. Another high point in the film is the cast.",7,0,2,6 September 2014
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Good
","George Lucas famously described the trilogy as a 'three-act play.' And what a start to that play.I was five when I saw this for the first time. My parents saw it at the theater, and all I remember of the experience was seeing Darth Vader for the first time and being scared. George Lucas created something amazing. God bless this film. Star Wars is the best thing ever. It has better ideas and creativity than any other movie since. It couldn't be greater! From the opening scene on, this movie keeps you sitting on the edge of your seat. If you haven't see this movie, do so. Everyone has to admit that its originality makes this one of the best movies of all time. It will always be one of my favorites.",7,0,2,17 August 2014
300," Good
","Violent and totally faithful to its source material, 300 is a brave artistic film. It's an epic film about a collision of cultures, and it has many interesting elements of truth. Warriors fight each other to settle old scores in a world of violence. Gerard Butler plays a legendary hero and a master of violence. The characters in this film have a lot of depth and the realism with which they are portrayed by the actors is shocking at times. This is a story about a place most people might not be able to conceive. The editing lets the actors breathe and the music lets the atmosphere live.

","The movie is very light-hearted and it isn't complex at all. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated many falsehoods. The main characteristic of the film is the gloomy atmosphere, emphasizing the desolate hopelessness. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. The acting is very effective. Chris Evans gives the best performance as Johnny Storm, but Chiklis gives a good performance that is a little heartwarming. The only thing that keeps it afloat is the sensitivity of the bilaterally desperately needy relationship between the heroes. A true gem.",7,4,5,18 August 2014
Pineapple Express," Good
","I was impressed. It's the best stoner film yet, but there is more to it than just getting high. It's definitely not the thing to see if you're in the mood for something fun and uplifting, or something with tons of thrills and action. The metaphors in this movie are abundant. Are there annoying things in this movie? Yes, like the overdone effects. But the movie has enough to keep you entertained. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed.

Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Good
","This film is not as bad as they say. Vivid scenes and good dialog highlight this one. The acting is very effective. But bad cinematography gives the film a washed-out look. Bad costumes hurt it and so does the anti-climactic conclusion. I think it is still a reasonable film. It solidifies the comeback for Cruise as a unique presence in American cinema and hopefully is a sign that he will do more of these kinds of austere, gripping character pieces more often in the future. This film was nearly perfect, but sadly still not made for everyone. It's an important film, as well as very entertaining. Truly a gritty, hard movie about gritty hard people",7,3,5,19 August 2014
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Good
","The cinematography is stark and bare. It's fun watching it because its complexity begins within its characters. Say what you will, this film is very light-hearted and not complex at all as the different characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated too many falsehoods. The story is nothing special, but exceptional performances from most of the cast go a long way. I thought this was cute and not bad at all. Filled with charm, innocence and drama. The blend of strong acting, a strong story and some inventive camera-work earns this outer space vehicle a rating of 7/10. It was well-received at its American premiere.",7,2,3,22 August 2014
Happy Feet," Good
","Passable fun. Into the world of the Emperor Penguins, who find their soul mates through song, a penguin is born who cannot sing. But he can tap dance something fierce! I never laughed so hard in my life. After reading some of the negative reviews on here, I just have to say that some people really don't get it. It is very light-hearted and it isn't complex at all. My girlfriends and I were so excited to see this movie, thinking it was going to be a fun movie. The main plot of the film was constantly being interrupted. You can predict the whole movie and ending very easily. If you can find it on DVD, buy it for sure and enjoy.",7,0,0,22 August 2014
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Good
","An excellent and difficult production, bolstered by great performances. Harrison Ford delivers his best Indy performance. I can remember being in awe when I first saw this movie in the theatre. Nothing I'd seen since compared. . It's not 'touchy feely' in any sense. That being said, you still get your classic moments. The leads' combined talents and charisma have a lot to do with this movie's success. I found the acting to be sensational, the dialogue incredible and the director's abilities to be up to par and then some.

However, on viewing the film I must say the persons involved did a credible job.The dichotomy in reviewer assessments of BEETLEJUICE has, I fear, more to do with the reviewers' life experiences than the film. The movie itself is nothing that special, but it has some good stuff.I found the acting to be sensational, the dialogue incredible and the director's abilities to be up to par and then some.

The cinematography is stark and bare. In the bundle of all that it lacks, I feel that the movie is ignored for its writing. Quality work that draws you in and doesn't let you go. I suggest this movie to everyone. This is actually a serious movie with a serious message. It is a powerful film, but I doubt I will ever want to watch it again. I like this type of film, as it reminds me of German movies where it's more about the characters and their environment. Final rating from me: seven out of ten, almost eight out of ten.",7,1,3,1 September 2014
