The Ring," Glad I waited until it came to the discount theater
","This movie is not nearly as scary as everyone made it sound.  My friend had me believing it was so scary that while i was waiting for it to start I was wondering if I should have decided to see Die Another Day instead.  Well, I'm glad I saw it for only $4 w/ unlimited soda and popcorn, but I won't be seeing it again.  Short summary: If you happen to watch this videotape, you'll die in 7 days. After her niece's mysterious death, Rachel finds the tape and watches it. She decides to figure out who made the tape and why, and how to possibly avoid death, before her time is up.To me, there are different horror categories. First there are the realistic and the unrealistic.  Realistic are the ones with human serial killers or ghosts.  In the unrealistic, the 'killers' may be some kind of robots, aliens, or in the case of The Ring, a videotape.  I like watching both types, but the realistic kinds scare me more because I walk out knowing something like that could really happen, or have happened.  There are 3 other groups to divide horror movies.  There's the scary ones(like Scream), the creepy/spooky ones(like The Others), and the sad/freaky ones(like The Ring).  This movie will probably scare some people, but not me.   I usually get scared at movies that have a lot of suspense and moments that make me jump.  This movie was suspenseful, but there was no moments to jump.  And I don't understand why people would scream.  It really is more of a mystery type movie than a horror movie.  And even though I gave this a 6/10, if you like horror movies you should watch it anyway.",6,0,0,26 January 2003
10 Things I Hate About You," SOOO good
","This movie made me fall in love with Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger.  It was the first movie I've seen with either of them in it and they were so good together.  They are now two of my favorite actors.This is a modernized version of Shakespeare's 'The Taming of The Shrew'. The Stratford sisters, Kat and Bianca, are complete opposites.  Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) is the popular daddy's girl and Kat(Julia Stiles) is a 'Heinous bitch' as described in the movie.  The new kid at school, Cameron(Joseph Gordon Levitt), is crazy about Bianca.  The problem is, The Stratfords' dad is so strict and Bianca can't date unless Kat dates.  Now Cameron is determined to find someone to go out with Kat so he can date Bianca.There are some cheesy moments, but they are so cute and there is a lot of humor.  All teens should really enjoy this movie.",9,0,0,7 January 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," You'll either like it or love it
","I've never read Tolkien's books, but I did see The Hobbit cartoon movie. When The Fellowship of the Ring came out, I figured I'd see it since everyone was talking about how 'impossible' it was.  When I saw it in the theaters I hated it.  I thought it was too long and the parts between the action scenes were too boring.  But when my brother got it on DVD he made me watch it again and I slowly fell in love with it more and more each time I saw it.People who have read and enjoyed the books will definitely enjoy the movie. It was a great achievement for Peter Jackson.  Everything was so real. The scenery, costumes, and acting were very well.  For those who are not into the books, you will most likely love this movie.  But if you don't like adventure movies, it may not be for you.  I still would recommend everyone see this movie at least 2 times before saying whether you love/hate it.",10,1,1,20 December 2002
The Patriot," Worth 165 minutes of your time
","Don't believe anyone who says this isn't a good movie.  You must see it for yourself.  I may sound like I'm going off on a tangent, but hear my story:I can remember that when this movie was in the theaters, I kind of wanted to see it, but then changed my mind.  My best friend invited me over her house to watch a movie and my choices were Gladiator and The Patriot.  I told her I had no desire to see the Patriot so we watched Gladiator(very good movie). Afterwards she kept telling me to watch the Patriot because it was so good and there was this really hot actor Heath Ledger in it(who I didn't know at the time).  I'm so glad I finally saw it.  I cried the first time(but I'm not going to tell you what part of the movie) and i guarantee; if you tend to cry in movies, you'll definitely cry for this one.  But don't worry, when you consider that this IS A WAR MOVIE, it's not too sad.  And as someone has said in a previous comment, it is a VERY GORY movie.  It's definitely more gory than Gladiator.  But that just adds to the realism.  But why would you expect anything less from such a movie?  this is how war really is. I give this movie a ~9/10~Flaws in the movie: I liked this movie so much I saw it several times in a short period.  I found a few unlikely things.  Here's the big one to me:  Benjamin Martin is a SOUTHERNER living in SOUTH CAROLINA in the 1770s.  What do you think the odds are that he would have free black people working on his farm?  Think about it.  It would be understandable if he lived in a northern state, or even Maryland, but not South Carolina.  That state wanted to leave the union in the 1800s because they wanted slavery.  Another one which kind of goes hand in hand is that Gabriel talks about a free world after the war where blacks and whites are equal.  well, it's 2003 and unfortunately there still isn't equilibrium.  So what are the odds a southerner would dream of this in 1776?  Even many northerners didn't believe that.  they wanted African Americans free, but not equal.  There are some other things which are unlikely but they are also spoilers and i hate telling spoilers.So all in all a great movie which everyone may see **sensitive moviegoers, don't forget your tissues and barf bag**",8,0,1,13 January 2003
Blue Crush," Definitely worth watching...
","All I can say is  this movie wasn't exactly what I expected.  And that is a good thing.  From the previews, I thought it was going to be all 'girls in bikinis, sex, parties...and oh yeah, surfing.'  But it really isn't like that.  Yes, there are girls in bikinis pretty much the entire movie.  But the focus is not on their bodies, it really is on the waves, the sport of surfing.Anne Marie, Lena, and Eden are best friends.  They live in Hawaii and their entire life revolves around surfing.  Anne Marie is invited to compete in the Pipe Masters, but a bad experience from 3 years before still haunts her. She is torn between taking a big risk to make her dreams come true or playing it safe.I really liked the way this movie was not at all cliche.  And the shots are really cool.  You get inside the wave and quickly into the movie.  Just watch it.",6,0,0,10 February 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Just as good as the first
","I really really liked this movie.  If you enjoyed the first you will definitely like this.  The whole tree thing was really weird but funny(I don't want to give anything away).  One thing that may be a drawback: nothing is solved.  Frodo and Sam still need to get to Mordor.  Aragorn and Arwen love each other but have to decide if it's worth the sacrifices. And oh yeah, Saruman still has power and we don't even really know anything about Sauron.  Yet, the hobbits and dwarfs provide enough comic relief to keep the movie going.  Alone, this movie good, but with The Fellowship and Return Of The King, it is excellent.  Generally the middle movie im trilogies aren't as good because they just bring the other 2 together, but I still would give this movie a 10/10.",8,0,0,20 December 2002
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Makes up for the first two episodes
","Revenge of the Sith was an all-around good film. I enjoyed The Phantom Menace and The Attack of the Clones even though I knew they were horrible for many reasons. But this movie definitely makes up for the first two and happily links this trilogy to the original Star Wars.Most people would agree that TPM and AOTC has much better special effects than the original trilogy but a horrible story. This movie is balanced with great special effects and a proper story. Although I didn't like the opening scene and a few fight scenes because they look like George Lucas is just trying to show off all the new effects he has learned, I was impressed by the improvements with Yoda. But even without the special effects, the movie was still good. The actors performed much better in this movie, especially Hayden Christianson. He wonderfully makes you sympathize with Anakin and makes you both excited and terrified as he descends to the dark side.All in all I would say that I am no longer ashamed to place my new movies next to the original trilogy. I believe that most Star Wars fans will be satisfied with Revenge of the Sith.",8,1,5,19 May 2005
Gladiator," One of the greatest movies ever!!
","I wanted to see this movie so bad when i saw the previews but i didn't see it until it came out on video.  This is one of my all time favorite movies. I didn't even know who Russell Crowe was before I saw this.  Now he is one of my favorite actors.  His performance is beyond great, there are no words to describe it.  The entire movie is just so good, there are no cheesy or stupid scenes.  it's a movie anyone can love and EVERYONE should see.  And the battle scenes are really good.  They are gory, but if you saw The Patriot with Mel Gibson and was okay, you'll be fine in this movie.  I don't want to say much about the plot of the story because it is just so good and everyone has to see it for themselves.",10,1,1,9 January 2003
