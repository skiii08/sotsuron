Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Great film, b-movie and chop-socky lovers will go crazy for it!
","This is a great and satisfying conclusion to Tarantino's spaghetti western kung-fu, B-movie extravaganza. The film continues where we left Uma, having killed off Lucy Liu and Vivaca Fox. Now she has Michael Madsen, Darryl Hannah and David Carridine left to obliterate.Much like the last episode this is super cool and very violent. Tarantino takes great delight in referencing the genres he loves and referencing movies in this from Drunken Master to Blade Runner. The 2nd part is far less visceral and less action packed, giving us more story concerning the Bride and we also get more insight into Bill. This installment really has something going for it with the more central appearances for both Madsen and Carradine as Bill. Madsen is excellent and once again Tarantino gets the best from him. This is a great role for him as Budd. Budd initially seems like a beaten down, shell of a man who has no inspiration left in him and in many ways regrets what he did to the Bride. He seems as if he will just kneel before this angel of death and take his punishment, that is until he gets a taste for the kill again and finds he can enjoy torturing her, he becomes invigorated by violence. Carradine rocks as Bill. This is the best thing I have seen from him, he is excellent here. Carradine rules the film when he is on screen. Darryl Hannah has rarely been as good in a role that really pushes and kicks the ass of the image of the cutesy and loveable girl next door she was most famous for in the 80's. Uma Thurman is once again brilliant, sexy, and tough. This part really allows her to stretch as an actress and episode 2 gives the depth to the character to move the Bride to the next level from the first part. I am not the only one who feels that Thurman should get an Oscar nomination for her part in Kill Bill 2.This is a satisfying conclusion to a great and refreshing story. I can't wait to watch them together as a whole. ****1/2",9,0,1,9 June 2004
Mission: Impossible III," Simple, great fun!
","The third in the franchise of MI films has been as much about Cruise and Holmes, Scientology, than it has about Ethan Hunt's latest escapade. Cruise has had much publicity, mostly bad, in the build up but after all is said and done, MI3 ends up being a rip roaring blockbuster. It's back to being a Mission Impossible film, it's got the team, the gadgets, the espionage. It has an MI feel lacking, especially in the second instalment. JJ Abram's in his big screen directorial debut does a great job. This is slam bang, thank you mam! Forget the plot, it doesn't matter, but there's enough twists and turns to keep in theme.The film is just great fun. The plot doesn't get too convoluted, like the first film, and it's not bogged down with lameness like the second. It's just a simple plot, keeping within the elements that work in this sort of film. While Abram's stylish direction, is flashy without feeling hollow and too Hollywood blockbuster. He keeps a nice quick pace to the proceedings and cranks up the action when he needs to. Cruise is excellent in action hero mode once again, and of course does his dues with the stunt work as well. What's great though is this isn't all about the Cruise, it's about his team too. He needs the team this time round and it's very much a team movie. John Rhys Meyers, Maggie Q, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Larry Fishbourne, Billy Crudup all do their bit here with good support, while the gorgeous Michelle Monaghan is effervescent. It's Simon Pegg though who stands out, managing to steal all his scenes.This is just good fun all round, and certainly better than the second film. However I feel that the first film has more standout moments and the opening 40 minutes in Prague were excellent, unsurpassed in the trilogy of MI films. Still in terms of action films, MI3 is a good simplistic ride. ***",7,1,2,2 June 2006
Catch Me If You Can," Another top class offering from Steve!
","Another fantastic movie from Steven Spielberg. While I think this is not quite as good as Minority Report, it is more light hearted and simplistic entertainment, a film you can really watch anytime. As with all Spielberg films, his storytelling is wonderful as is his cast. In this film, amongst others, we have Leonardo Di Caprio, Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken. This makes for great watching, and the story itself is amazing, because it sounds so implausible yet it happened in real life. Frank Abagnale Jr went around the whole of the USA and parts of Europe conning people and cashing in millions in fraudulant cheques. The material on paper looks like it would have difficulty sustaining a two and a half hour movie but truth be told there are no such troubles, with Spielberg behind camera and the grade A cast all on top form it's simply engrossing and movie making magic.Overall this rates as probably the best film so far of 2003. Its not quite a classic but still  is a great piece of entertainment. ****",9,1,2,17 February 2003
The Ring," Scariest film ever!!
","I am not normally a fan of horror films, for the simple reason that films generally don't scare me. I say don't normally, because this did. Some films can feel genuinely creepy and make you feel unnerved in some moments, films like Signs as a recent example, who didn't feel the blood leaving their chest when the first got sight of one of the Aliens in the Brazilian home video scene. The Ring has scenes like this throughout, and it makes you feel uncomfortable throughout the movie, and gets you really jumpy.There are big shocks and lots of little shocks and it is down to some first rate editing, directing and sound editing, as well as some unsettling imagery. The cast are all good, the gorgeous Naomi Watts is excellent in the lead and very convincing and there is a great cameo from Brian Cox, in suitably creepy mode. David Dorfman is good as Watt's son, he is a very good child actor, and in this sort of film it is essential to have a good actor for the child parts, Haley Joel Osment in Sixth Sense being a good example. Martin Henderson is also good playing the ex boyfriend of Naomi Watt's character Rachel.The film pans out brilliantly. From the initial opening death sequence to Rachel's investigations of the tape that apparently kills people if they watch. The tape holds within it a vengeful spirit who kills their victims seven days after they watch the tape. Gore Verbinski's version of the classic Japanese horror is excellent, and intriguing, it is how a horror film should be, it genuinely unsettled me, no film for years has done that, not even the Exorcist did.You should definitely watch this, and I hope there will be a sequel. I intend to watch this alone in a dark room when it comes out on DVD. 10/10",10,1,1,25 February 2003
Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of them ost loved films ever!
","Perhaps the best and most entertaining fantasy adventure ever made. The combination of Lucas and Spielberg behind the camera is winning while Harrison Ford is excellent in his landmark role, most iconic role. He's been Han Solo, Jack Ryan but Indiana Jones is the one for me. This is so exciting, funny and it has a glorious B-movie feel to it all. The timing of everything is excellent and many could argue whether Spielberg has had a finer moment since and considering he has had the likes of the sequels, Schindler's list, Jurassic Park, Minority Report and Saving Private Ryan amongst others that is some indication as to how good this film is. Karen Allen is also very good and in many ways Indy's love interest's in the sequels have not lived up to Allen's role. *****",10,0,0,23 July 2004
Minority Report," Film making excellence!!
","It has been highly anticipated to say the least. Minority Report on paper should be a truly great film. Spielberg directing Tom Cruise in a story based on a Phillip K Dick story. With such a weight of expectation to live up to, I am pleased to say this is not a disappointment. This is movie making at its best, a magnificent movie that's imaginative, exciting and provoking. It simply put is a classic, it'll take a few years, I suspect, until people view it as a classic, ala Blade Runner, but this is certainly one of the best movies I have seen and is in my top ten for sure.Firstly the story. The film is set in 2054 when a special pre-crime division of the police is set up in Washington. This is where three `gifted' individuals known as pre-cogs have psychic visions of crimes that are going to happen. The pre-crime unit lead by John Anderton (Cruise) are given the names of the victims, perpetrators and when it will happen, and it is down to them to analyse the visions to work out where. They then have to set out to stop the murder before it will happen. They have been successful, not one murder in six years, and now there is a chance the technologies used in Washington will go national. Anyway enter Colin Farrells as detective Ed Witter, he is investigating how they run and is put in charge. He seems to be scheming. Anyway this system is apparently perfect. John swears by it and believes in the system completely until he discovers that he has been seen by the pre-cogs murdering someone. He has 36 hours to find out who and why, whilst running from his colleagues. On ensues some great action, and your typically good twists and turns in this sort of thriller.Spielbergs direction as you would expect is masterful and exemplary, definitely a lesson in how to direct for any aspiring film makers. Visually this film is amazing, great cinematography and the special effects are great. They help the film along rather than swamp the film unlike say Star Wars episode 1 and 2 where they were far too reliant on their CGI and didn't bother on the script. This gets the blend right. Top of the range effects and a brilliant script. The film is darker than his usual films and is chilling at times. People sensitive about their eyes may cringe on occasion.Tom Cruise is excellent. He is a great actor and on the evidence of this and the Mission Impossibles a great action star. He does his own stunts and not just that but very impressive stunts and that adds to his action scenes to more of a degree than any other Hollywood star. His performance is very good as the man on the run and also a grieving father who lost is son 6 years previously, a main reason why he joined pre-crime to stop it happening to anyone else. Also good is Max Von Sydow, as the creator of Pre- Crime and Tom Cruises boss. The rest of the cast are very good, especially Collin Farrell as Ed Witter, who is after Anderton. Finally Samantha Morton who is also superb as the Pre- Cog Agatha who is the most important of them. She is very good, and really draws the audience in.Overall this film is superb, there is the odd continuity error that you expect in any film, such as how come Cruise can still use his eyes in the scanners to enter the Police building. Surely if he is wanted for murder they would ensure he can't enter their building and steal Agatha. Anyway its a minor quibble seeing as how the rest of the film is so excellent with some devilishly good twists. 10/10",Null,0,0,9 July 2002
Training Day," Denzel makes this movie!
","This is a cracking cop thriller. The premise is simple, with Ethan Hawkes rookie cop taken on a training day with experienced and hardened officer Denzel Washington. He soon discovers that Denzel has let the position of power go to his head and that he is quite prepared to abuse his power. Hawke is excellent in his role as the rookie caught up in a terrible world of police corruption and he is deserving of his Oscar nomination, perhaps deserved of the win. Denzel is superb though. His character is meaty, with this guy almost being a personification of evil while also having other personalities to him, a character who is almost trying to delude himself into thinking that he is an upholder of the law. Washington is amazing, this is one of the greatest bad guy performances ever. Denzel is like a firecracker, one minute he is exploding and showing off an alarming attitude towards policing and the next he is talking Hawkes character round, convincing him that what they do is right. He is so good he almost talks the audience round at the same time. Of course the film may seem very exaggerated in regards to the police corruption in LA (ten cops from each precinct can be charged with abusing their privileges and the law apparently!). Overall this is a classy thriller directed with style by Antoine Fuqua. ****",8,0,11,23 July 2004
Se7en," One of the 90's best movies!
","David Fincher has become one of Hollywood's most wanted directors since this film and this is a fantastic film. Since this he hasn't done a bad film, in fact most are excellent. Seven is more conventional than his films the Game and Fight Club but it has a great script which is fantastically directed. The actors of the film are of the highest calibre. Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwynith Paltrow and Kevin Spacey are all fantastic, Freeman and Spacey in particular. The film has plenty of twists and is involving while everything comes to a shocking and stomach churning ending. This is definitely one of the best crime thrillers ever made.As with other Fincher movies it looks fantastic. The cinematography is outstanding. The score is also fantastic and the overall look and sound of the film is top class. This is a modern classic, no doubt. *****",10,4,5,23 July 2004
Memento," Could this be one of the best films ever?
","This film is pure excellence. Much like Usual Suspects in 1995 this is a brilliantly written piece of low budget magic. It is original and surprising and has gone down as a cult classic, and deservedly so.Much like Usual Suspects this doesn't have any out and out big Hollywood stars but does have some great actors who are recognizable. The film centres around Leonard Shelby, a man whose wife was brutally murdered also leaving him with a memory disorder, where by he cannot create new memories, so while trying to hunt down the killer he has to contend with the fact he forgets things in a matter of minutes. He overcomes this by routines, he writes things down, takes pictures and also tattoos himself. This isn't, as most will know, a start to finish sort of film. The ingenious part is that the film starts with the end basically. Leonard has found the killer, played by Joe Pantoliano, and he kills him. Then the film plays backwards revealing how he tracked down the killer and some important facts he forgot.Guy Pearce is very good in the lead, he certainly shows enough here to have warranted an Oscar nomination had he got one, and also Carrie Anne Moss as Natalie, who may or may not be a friend to help Leonard. Joe Pantoliano was as usual very good as were the rest of the cast. This film is fantastic, genuinely surprising and a real lesson to the big Hollywood studio, that the art of writing a clever film is not dead. 10/10",Null,0,2,16 January 2003
Dawn of the Dead," Etertaining gore-fest!
","This is a remake of the seminal zombie classic and the second zombie film of the year, so how does it match up to the original and indeed Shaun Of The Dead? Well in truth it gets thoroughly beaten hard by the other two but this is still a very enjoyable gore fest. The film is a loving homage to the original taking pretty much the same story and setting of a group of survivors holding up in a mall while thousands of peckish zombies try to break in and eat them. It's got a clichéd group of characters as is usually the case and lacks the heart of the original but this is a very polished and expertly crafted piece of schlock horror. Cast wise there is no star name to headline and ride this like an ego-vehicle and stink up the place, this relies on unknowns and cult actors. In fact the biggest names in this are Vhing Rhames, Mekhi Phifer and Sarah Polley. All the cast are good and Jake Weber in particular is excellent. There is certainly a good mixture in the cast and each character is different. Director Zack Snyder handles things well and creates tension while letting lose when the action hits overdrive. Like Dawn Of The Dead in 78, this film has superlative gore effects. In fact this was a superbly gruesome movie with plenty of zombie biting and flying entrails to keep the gore nuts happy. It is a key element for a film such as this and thankfully the effects are spot on. The film is entertaining and while it's not the best zombie film it has a great beginning that grabs the audience by the nuts and then does so again with the superb ending. ***½",7,1,1,1 November 2004
12 Monkeys," Gilliam is a genius!
","This marks a welcome return to the fantastical for Terry Gilliam after a brief vacation from it with The Fisher King. It is also his debut into Sci-Fi and is widely regard as one of his best works. It is certainly my favourite although many would argue that the depth and imagination of Brazil is more impressive. I love a good Sci-Fi film though an this is one of the best, ranking with the like of the Terminator films. The films script is brilliant. The plot unravels nicely, hinting towards insanity of the central character and false truth. Is it all real or imaginary? Is Willis insane. The twists at the end are brilliant as Willis realises the truth of haunting memories he has from his childhood. In terms of Time Travel movies this doesn't get too bogged down in all that and as such does not fall into giant plot holes and paradoxes. The cast are good. Willis shines, as does Madeline Stowe and Brad Pitt shows he can act with this Oscar nominated performance. Visually this is great and raises questions at the same time. *****",10,0,0,23 July 2004
Shaun of the Dead," Film of The Year!! Instant Cult Classic!
","This film is a geek boy's wet dream! It is a pleasant and refreshing surprise that a film about zombies, and also a British film is so fresh and vibrant and so entertaining. Spaced creative duo Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright are the writers here and Wright is the director. Their obviously geekish love of film is evident in the superbly entertaining Spaced and in this film as well. Simon Pegg leads a superb cast of comic talent and plays the part of loser Shaun to perfection. The film is an obvious homage to Dawn Of The Dead and follows almost the same pattern. One morning the world is suddenly crawling with the undead, and to ingenious comical effect the intellectually challenged Shaun and his best mate, equal in the stupid loser stakes, Ed, don't realise this for ages. The performances of both Pegg and Nick Frost as Ed are superb. The dialogue in the film is fantastic. There are constant laughs throughout this and some real big belly laughs too. Kate Ashfield is also good as Shaun's long suffering girlfriend. There is also great suport from Lucy Davis and a superb Jessica Stevenson. I'm a little disappointed Stevenson, a lead in Spaced is relegated to a cameo here.The film is superb as a comedy but what marks this down as instant cult classic is the fact that the dramatic sides and the horror elements also work great. There are some genuine jumps and scares and Wright manages to create real tension. I have to safely say as well the soundtrack is one of the best ever. This is overall a great film for buffs and general movie goers alike. This is perhaps the film of the year so far, alongside School Of Rock. ****",9,0,1,22 April 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Great fun.
","Yet another sequel! Capn' Jack returns for another adventure, and this time the scale is ginormous! If you thought Pirates 1 was action packed, and spectacular, this film goes far beyond with massive sets, brilliant effects, and a massive 2 and a half hour running time, that will have you leaving the theatre feeling like you've spent a year in the harshest prison, wearing a ballerina's outfit, with a bull's-eye painted on your rear. Now the scale is huge, and there's all the lavish extravagance that Bruckheimer loves to give his punters, but the story lacks some cohesion, and it's all a bit too much, without much in the way of character depth. That could be an unfair nitpicking for a film entitled Pirates of the Caribbean sure, but the film is little more than a rollicking and fun night out at the cinema. It's not going to adorn top 100 lists of film buffs around the world that's for sure.However this is the second in a series of films that should be predominantly about fun, spectacle, and pure entertainment. In this regard Pirates 2 more than delivers, while maybe lacking the ingenuity and surprise factor of the first movie which, mainly thanks to Johnny Depp, took the public by storm. Depp once again is superb, despite giving one of his least interesting performances, as of course this is the first time ever, he's reprised a role, and Depp of course is renowned for doing startlingly different roles from one film to the next. It actually seems incredibly strange to see Depp treading old ground, still his creation of Jack Sparrow is superb. Orlando Bloom again is in the film for little more than to play the straight man to Depp, and to look good for the ladies. It's not a great role for Bloom, who as yet hasn't proved just whether he's going to be a top actor or not, or merely a pretty boy. To some extent the same is true of Keira Knightly, who come mud, sweat, grime, or rain, or dragged up as a boy, looks phenomenal. However while this role offers little for Keira she has already proved she's going to be a great actress (one Oscar nod to her name already!). On one regard though Bloom and Knightley at least have more to do in this film, and Depp is allowed to step back every now and again. This isn't merely the Depp show, which is arguably to the films detriment. The rest of the cast are good, but it's Bill Nighy who steals the show managing to convey an amazingly expressive performance from behind his squiddy CGI mask.All in all Pirates 2 delivers all you could want in a fantasy adventure. The story gets muddle in amongst all the swordfights and giant sea creatures, but still for pure fun at the movies, you can't go far with this. I most certainly look forward to Pirates 3. ***1/2",7,8,15,2 August 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," One of the years best, pure fun start to finish, Depp is on Fire!!
","Harking back to the days when Pirate films and fantasy films were being released with decidedly more regularity this film really brings the young imp inside us all out, the sort of young imp that takes delight in watching classic fantasy swashbucklers from the 80's such as the Princess Bride. I am a big fantasy film fan, I love to plonk on oldies like Krull, Labyrinth and this is the sort of film that really brings that desire back again, not quite to the same level that Lord of the Rings did but still this is a fantastic adventure movie.What you have here is your basic pirate/fantasy adventure storyline, there is treasure involved, ghosts and of course damsels to be rescued not a Princess but a governors daughter in this case. Considering that the last big studio pirate film was the pap Cutthroat Island and that this film is based off of a theme park ride the signs did look ominous that this would be pants, but the cast involved plus good scriptwriters and a very excitable trailer put pay to that and as such this has struck gold at the box office and is a critical and public success.The film has great set design, it looks great and there is real scale to it. The action is exciting, the score is chest thumpingly good and the film creates a sense of magic, this is movie making magic, it's a feel good summer movie and has likeable characters and a witty script, hence this seems to have got the best audience reaction I've heard in ages. This movie is about having a great time, it's not particularly meaningful but it is great all round family fun that doesn't suffer from dull patches or failed expectations.The cast are all good. Orlando Bloom is given a lead role for the first time and he handles himself well, Keira Knightly is feisty and sexy as the damsel in distress, who of course is whooping ass with the best of them by the end. Then there are Brit actors such as Jonathan Pryce, Jack Davenport and Kevin Mcnally who are all good. Geoffory Rush takes delight in chewing the scenery as the bad guy, but in typically show stopping form is Johnny Depp as Cap'n Jack Sparrow who plays him out like Keith Richards from the Rolling Stones (I s*** you not). Depp is superb, he makes the movie, the movie on its own right is pure fun and a good time but Depp really does add another level to it with his charm and his humour. He has boundless energy throughout the film and his cockney accent is faultless, Depp proves once again what a versatile actor he really. Until watching this filming I had not enjoyed a film so much this year aside from Nemo and X2. It was a rollicking good time with great effects, and also very funny. This is good news for the fantasy film genre, with it coming alive recently with hits like Lord of the Rings and Harry Porter perhaps we'll see some more, while perhaps not with the regularity of certain periods like the 50's or 80's. One of the years best most definitely.****",9,0,1,18 July 2003
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A worthy adaptation!
","Not before time this classic story has finally been brought to the big screen. In this time of sequels, adaptations, and a real lack of original ideas it seemed only right that CS Lewis's first Narnian tale should be given the big budget treatment. Under the direction of Andrew Adamson making his live action debut following two successful gigs as director of the Shrek films, this film has the requisite looks and Adamson proves worthy of a film this big, albeit lacking some of the extra flair and conviction injected into the last two Potters and particularly the LOTR trilogy.Everyone knows the story of the Pevensie kids finding a magical world inside a wardrobe, and becoming the saviours of a whole world. It's a classic tale and taps into the inventive imaginations of young children. It certainly strikes a chord with younger children perhaps more so than Tolkien's middle earth books. Wardrobe is certainly a well made spectacle but at it's 140 minutes length something between book and films doesn't quite gel. In truth the books are extremely simplistic having been aimed at under 10's primarily. This means that in order to transfer the book to screen the filmmakers have had to extend parts, add in depth. Unfortunately there isn't much depth added and as such the character development of the children, and other side characters is thin, or anorexic for want of a better word. At times the film heavily milks LOTR. In fact milking it so hard at times that some cheese actually comes out. We have the kid's given special weapon's etc as they become moved to the idea of helping Narnia. However the battle scenes seems fragmented and tacked on and the kid's barely uses their special gifts before the battle ends sharply. Really this is nothing to have the epic 30 minute battles of the Two Towers and Return Of The King running to the hills.The film though is still an enjoyable fantasy romp and feels very short despite the epic running time. It seemed to breeze by, because there wasn't much depth to it. The Pevensie kid's are good. Georgie Henley is engaging as Lucy, perhaps the most important role, while Skander Keynes is not as strong in his role as Edmund and at times grates, but being so young he can be cut slack. Willaim Mosely does well as Peter, while the beautiful Anna Pepperell (Whose surname could almost be that of a Narnia inhabitant!) is very good as Susan. What works is that all the actors are perhaps two years older than their characters in the book, and as such there is an added maturity to the performances while they still all look right for the part, something similar in the Potter films as those actors continue to grow in their roles. As for the White Witch, she is played with menace and gusto by Tilda Swinton, strangely sexy as the epitome of all evil.Harry Gregson Williams was like the director a surprise choice to do the score. However he adds something interesting to it and isn't merely content to do a generic fantasy epic score. The music really adds something to the film. Of course the effects, aside from a few sub par moments, are all excellent particularly the creation of Aslan the lion, voiced majestically by Liam Neeson.Overall this is a worthy adaptation of a much beloved book that may fall short of the standards of Peter Jackson's LOTR films and the last two excellent Potter films, but as far as fantasy films go it's a worthy watch and truthfully does as much as could be done with such simple material. While Adamson may not have been the ideal director to explore the world visually he certainly does a good job. ***½",7,1,2,27 December 2005
Spider-Man 2," Film of the Year! Best comic book movie ever!
","Spiderman on a world scale is arguably the most popular comic book character there is. Many polls have been taken and most of the time Spidey sits proudly, perched above Superman and Batman as the comic book character everyone loves. Generally in England we prefer Batman because Bruce Wayne has a kind of British sensibility and aura about him, probably because he is posh and well spoken, how us Brits are stereotypically perceived. In terms of film translations from the comics I thought the first film was definitely one of the best, alongside X Men 2, The Crow, Superman and Batman. It was a great film, full of action, drama, thrills and al made so effective because of the characters in it. Raimi has made the characters and their journeys the important thing of the two movies and it makes them not just good action films but good films. Spiderman was a great film and while the sequel could easily have gone the typical sequel suit and up all the action and make everything more spectacular and forget about characters to focus on spectacle, this goes the route of the first film. Simply put, Spiderman 2 is a film of pure brilliance and can now easily be named as the best comic book film ever made.Poor old Peter Parker went through hell in the last movie and this picks up pretty much near where the last one left off, with Peter unable to live the life he wants because of responsibility. He has several jobs to hold down, his studies at College and all this combined with the responsibility to the public as the cities vigilante crime-fighter. All of this while the one thing he really wants, Mary-Jane, is un-obtainable. The whole movie has you aching for Parker because you feel for him so much. The poor guy goes through hell and the character has real depth, the likes of which action films never ever have. He is a real person, and relatable, that is what made the character so popular to everyone since he first appeared eons ago. His best friend Harry is growing somewhat distant to him and Harry is driven by his hatred for Spidey and need for revenge. This tears at Parker so much as well. Harry also resents Parker because he makes money from taking pictures of Spiderman. Mary Jane has also been pining for Peter. She needs confirmation that he really loves her and she needs to know she can rely on him but when she can't she decides to get married. All this in conjunction with Dr Octavious who in the typical accident in his attempts to create a new super energy through fusion, ends up disfigured with 4 titanium arms welded to his spine and which control him. He is driven by the desire not to cause destruction and kill, but to finish his research but his maniacal state blinds him from the fact that this energy source could actually destroy half the city and in his attempts to get the resources needed he will rob banks, destroy buildings and kill. Parker through his stress and loss of enthusiasm for his job as city protector begins to lose his powers. He then calls it quits as Spidey and this causes a 75% rise in crime figures. This is all great stuff and soon Parker must try to regain his powers as he must save Mary-Jane from Doc Oc. There is a brilliant scene with Parker as a mere mortal. He spots a burning building and there is a child inside. The fire department can't do much but Parker runs into the building, he manages after a struggle and nearly killing himself, to rescue the child. It's an act of selfless bravery and he is commended for it by the firemen only to be told that someone was on the floor above and didn't get out alive. It dawns on Parker how special his gift was giving him an advantage over mortal men and women, he must use his advantages top help people and he knows he just can't sit by and let things like this happen, he could have saved both people from the burning building if he was still Spidey.The cast once again are superb. Toby Maguire was born to play Spidey, he is Superb. He gives a sensitivity and likeability to the role that perhaps casting more of a poster boy star would not have had. He's a great actor and that adds to the power of the film. Similarly Kirsten Dunst is excellent again as Mary-Jane. She brings warmth and natural beauty to the part. I was also really impressed with James Franco as Harry. His role is significantly extended in this film in terms of depth. Franco brings out the inner torture brilliantly, we see the first signs of a future insanity. Rosemary Harris is just excellent as Aunt May. She has nailed the role, plain and simple. Also to those who though that JK Simmons was excellent as Jonah Jameson and wanted more well you get it and his role is just as funny and much bigger. If you also thought that Willem Defoe was superbly villainous as the Green Goblin then you will love Alfred Molina as Dr Octopus. The cast really do add class to this. Also look out for Bruce Campbell as a snooty usher.The action is brilliant. The scenes are spectacular and as you would expect the effects are first rate. Raimi is a genius with effects. He really knows how to use them, he doesn't just put them in willy nilly and try to go for the coolest shots possible. He knows how to use them and combine them with the camera movement in a way that other effects geniuses like Peter Jackson and Jim Cameron can do. If you have also thought that Raimi has lost his raw edge and wackiness that he had in the Evil Deads and longed for full on Raimi style then you get it. This is Raimi unleashed. There are great references to Darkman and Evil Dead in this with P.O.V. shots and a lot more of Raimi's quirky style and humour. This film is not only dramatic and thrilling but it's also really funny and borders on slap-stick at times. Remember how well that blending worked in Evil Dead 2, well it's a combo that works superbly here. Also as ever Danny Elfman is the comic book score king. This is a great score.Overall this is almost certainly is and will remain the film of the year, easily. It's in the same ball park as how good the Rings trilogy was, it really is that good. Also look out for Stan Lee's cameo, it's priceless and had me jumping off my seat in applause. *****",10,0,0,8 July 2004
Finding Nemo," One of the films of the year!!
","Another fantastic film from the Pixar guys, and while this isn't the best I think it narrowly beats out Monsters Inc but I'm sorry you'll have to do something pant wettingly special to beat Toy Story 1 and 2. Of course saying `this isn't the best that Pixar have done' is kind of like giving a starving man 5 slices of Pizza and him saying the fifth slice isn't as good as the first!What makes this film is the witty script, the engaging story, likeable characters and superb vocal talent. As with many kids films there are messages to both parents and to children, about believing in yourself and what have you but Pixar have a knack of making the entire audience sit their with their mouths open, laughing, flinching and holding back a tear all in unison, with the odd separation at poo jokes (for kids and big kids) and subtle innuendo (for the grown ups and youngen's who know too much for their age).The cast of voices is impressive, headed up by Albert Brooks as Marlon, searching for his son Nemo, and also Ellen Degeneres. Admittedly I have always found Ellen funny but tiresome after too much, here no such problem, quoting from another review, `Ellen gives the sort of vocal performance that all others will now be judged by`, and it's true she brings the character to life so perfectly that even previous voice's for Pixar including Tom Hanks, Billy Crystal, Tim Allen and Joan Cusack can't compare. The audience loved her character. This is a fantastic movie, Pixars ability to combine their fantastic animation yet tell enchanting stories and get some fantastic vocal performance is second to none. Every time they bring a film out every two years it is one of the best of the year easily. Finding Nemo is no exception, this is movie making magic, an animated film about talking fish actually manages to gather more excitement than many of the big action blockbusters, and they were exciting themselves! *****",10,0,2,18 July 2003
Blade," Style, Class and gallons of blood!!
","This film is superb! Wesley Snipes Plays Blade the vampire hunter with pure class, he kicks butt in such a fluid and violent way that would make Bruce Lee proud. The movie is a fast paced, thrill ride of action and superb stunts. The first action scene and last are outstanding and Wesley looks like a Terminator as he runs around wiping out all suck heads. The script is pretty good and there is sharp dialogue too. Wesley should have done more action films than he has, i know he is a very good actor and in this he is not streched as much as in his more comic or drama roles but as far as action stars go he is the best actor of them all, only Bruce Willis, Stallone and perhaps Tom Cruise (if he counts as an action star) come close. Also aswell as Wesley being quality, Steven Dorff is also very good as the bad guy. It was an unexpected surprise that someone of small stature compared to Snipes should come across as menacing, but he does. Overall the film is sharp, stylish and i hope the sequal is done with the same sort of pace.",10,16,19,21 September 2001
The Others," Narrowly better than the sixth sense, which itself was excellent!
","The Others is a film similar to the Sixth sense, and like the Sixth Sense is very good. The Others in my opinion is narrowly better. I think that the film is so wonderfully shot and Kidmans performance is so good it narrowly beats Bruce Willis's flick. The gorgeous Nicole (you idiot Tom!) Kidman steals the show here as the mother of two children, the kids are photo sensitive and will die if exposed to light, after excuciating pain and suffocation that is, and their conditon makes way to create the chilling atmosphere of the film by the fact that the house is in near constant darkness. The films lighting is very spooky and the direction was very good, I was very uneasy watching this and I must say that it takes a lot to scare me but I nearly had a heart attck on a number of occasions with some very well timed jump moments. The film is scary, it makes you feel so nervy because of the dark atmosphere built up through brilliant cinematography and an eerie score. The other actors are good, the three people who play the mysterious house keepers were good and the two kids were a very high standard although do not compare to Haley Joel Osment but then again he is so far better than most child actors he is almost un-naturally good for someone his age. As I said before Nicole Kidman is excellent, she really earned some desreved respect in this film and Moulan Rouge. The film is very good with some great twists one of which I did see coming although it is not blindingly obvious, I just followed the classic rules of the movie world that most films of this type usually go by. If you stop and think you'll probably guess the main twist because the film makers will always go for the jugular when it comes to a plot twist. Overall 9/10 make sure spare undies are readily available before watching.",9,0,0,9 May 2002
Troy," Not bad but I suggest watching Gladiator!
","In the year of the epic this one stood out for me as the most excitable. The other big one left is King Arthur and as a fan of Excalibur I thought that they would have a tough time beating that. Also we have not as yet seen a large scale version of the Trojan wars. It is a story that screams out for a big screen adaptation. Impenetrable fortresses, super warriors and giant wooden horses it doesn't get much better.As far as your standard epics this is somewhere in the middle. Not great but certainly not that bad either. In terms of spectacle it is fantastic. The film looks superb and has some truly massive battles. In many ways though it offers nothing we haven't seen even more impressively in LOTR. I now the basic details of Homer's story so in terms of peoples complaints that it doesn't stay true enough to the text I couldn't really comment on, but it does have what I wanted to see, the giant wooden horse.The cast are good. You have a big array of talent all on top form. Firstly though the negative side. Brad Pitt. Now just to point out, I'm not an anti-Brad person. I'm in the minority who thinks he doesn't get enough appreciation for his acting. In Troy however he seems to Brad Pitt, too much like he is putting on an accent and acting. It's not natural and it seems very much like the makers are milking the fact that this is Brad Pitt, much like Cruise was milked in the Last Samurai. As an action man he manages to convince however. He's in great shape in this movie. In fact he has put on a lot of muscle and kept his trademark six pack, the ladies will be happy. Eric Bana is superb as Hector. He also makes a good action man and he is basically Troy's super warrior whereas Achilles (Pitt) is the Greeks super warrior, albeit one who hates his king and can't be controlled. Orlando Bloom is okay but for the guy who causes all this trouble over a bit of skirt he certainly seems to disappear from the film for lengthy spells. Brian Cox is as usual superb in a villainous role as Agamemnon. Is he really supposed to be that evil though, I remember Agamemnon was in Time Bandits played by Sean Connery and he was a stand up bloke. Brendan Gleeson is also good as is Peter O'Toole. Not forgetting Mr Sean Bean as well who is good as ever, if underused. As for Diane Kruger as the trouble making wench Helen. She is really required to do little else than be pretty (and did they have make-up in those days? because she doesn't half wear a lot of slap.).The films action and effects are as you would expect from a reportedly 200million dollar epic, first rate. The action really crunches, particularly with one-on-one encounters. The fight between Achilles' and Hector is excellent stuff. The battle scenes are impressive but as I said before they aren't as good as LOTR because of the ingenious way Jackson can use effects, he is a master. The story has problems for me. Not the screenplay as such, but the original text. They had a lot of stories from all those thousands of years ago that can seem at times pretty stupid. They didn't really mind plot holes back then. Yes people will say this is an epic love story, but those people will be females who love Orlando Bloom and want to mother his children. This fool Paris steals away the king of Spartas wife and then starts a war that will probably mean the destruction and death of his kingdom, all for a woman. No offence to Diane Kruger but there is not woman alive who looks good enough for that! I might for Jennifer Connelly though. The real hum-dinger is the fact that the Greeks supposedly seem to have left the shores of Troy having left a giant wooden horse, just large enough to house 500 Greek soldiers with adequate room for toilet facilities and a pool table. Then they decide to bring it into their impenetrable fortress. I reckon that Homer couldn't think of a realistic way that the walls of Troy could be breached so he decided that the Greeks should be let in, then he thought 'I'll have them hide inside a giant horse'. To be honest they did kind of deserve to get slaughtered, and Blooms head should have been put on a spike to show the world what a Muppet looks like. Yes I'm getting sarcastic now but this is a problem, you cannot side with the Trojans. Effectively Greece are the oppressors and the bad guys and the audience should be siding with the Trojans but they aint half stupid. The human side of the story and the characterisation doesn't allow you to get close to a character. You can't help but dislike Paris for being a fool and having a girly name. You can't help but think that Achilles is being acted out by someone. Peter O'Toole as the King of Troy I didn't like either, he should have given Paris a damn good thrashing when he came waltzing in with Helen Of Sparta, and sent them both back. He kept listening to crap advice ahead of sensible advice too. As far as rooting for characters the only one who is given a good human dimension who we can root for is Hector and Bana is very good in his role.As for the sound and the music in this film. Well the sound is excellent. When people get sliced into two you can really here the cracking of bone cartilage. Every penetration of sword buzzes and vibrates from the rafters to your chair and into your spine. Really great sound design in this and as with most films of this scale it is pretty much got it's name down as an Oscar nomination for the sound. The score however will not. It is a big let down. Apparently they had an original score done then they dumped it and hired a new composer to do it coming up with something that is so standard epic and 'lets rip off Gladiator' that it becomes intrusive at times and at other times doesn't affect you enough.Overall though this is a good popcorn muncher. It doesn't have any great depth that an epic really must have to become a classic, and certainly I preferred Last Samurai this year in the battle for number one epic. Thus far it has been a bit disappointing as none have come close to Gladiator. LOTR is kind of an epic but it is more fantasy as well. I suppose I'll count them as epics but that means that King Arthur and also Alexander will have an even higher, probably unobtainable standard to beat. Thus far Troy comes third in the year of the epic behind Passion Of Christ and behind current leader The Last Samurai.***",6,2,4,9 June 2004
Insomnia," One of the films of the year!
","***SPOILERS***    ***SPOILERS*** Al Pacino, Robin Williams, Hilary Swank all in the same film, it must be good, and it is. From Christopher Nolan, acclaimed British director of Memento, comes Insomnia.This is an exquisitely shot movie, directed with Oscar worthy assurance from Nolan and has three Oscar winners at the top of their game. This is one of the best films of the year, with of the blockbusting popcorn munchers like Star Wars and Spiderman, this is a great movie that requires thought and is a welcome change of pace, as was Minority Report  earlier in the year. For every couple of blockbusters that come out you need a good intelligent film like this as well.The story is this, in a small town in Alaska, a 17 year old girl has been murdered. Al Pacino's character Will Dormer and his partner are sent up to help the local law enforcement. The main reason for their temporary relocation is that Dormer and his partner are under investigation from Internal affairs. Dormers partner wants to cut a deal with them for the sake of his families but this would mean that Dormer would come under close scrutiny. Dormer doesn't want this as it could mean that if they dig up some dirt on him all his cases over the years will be questioned, and then murderers and rapists that he put away would be released. Dormer becomes angered by his partner, and it later becomes clear that their was dirt on him. Dormer had planted evidence on a child murderer to send him down, this was because there wasn't enough evidence to put him away, Dormer knew he did it and did what he thought was right, this raises the question `what would you do?' this is an involving thriller. Anyway, the investigations lead the law enforcement to a beach house where the killer emerges, and during a chase and shootout Dormer accidentally shoots down his partner and kills him. Dormer claims that the Williams character did it, and then covers his tracks by planting evidence and making sure he's in the clear. This leads Will to lose sleep, hence the title Insomnia, he his haunted by his dead partner and the guilt of breaking the law. Then Finch, played by Williams calls him. Finch knows that Dormer killed his partner and he claims that the murder of the girl was accidental. He tries to relate to Will, pointing out that they have a lot in common, in respect of suffering from Insomnia and the nature of their killings. The film is great in dealing with the relationship with Pacino and Williams, you never quite know whether Dormer will actually help clear Finch of the murder (which would mean sending an innocent kid to jail) and the scenes with Pacino and Williams together are excellent.The acting is first rate, Pacino is on top form and could well see his name on the nomination lists for the Academy awards, as could Robin Williams. He is brilliant in this film playing the killer, who is not your typical movie psycho. I thought that it may be difficult to take him seriously but he is really good, and proves what a top rate actor he is, not once did the words Nanu Nanu enter my head. Hilary Swanks is also very good. The rest of the cast were first rate.Overall this is a very good thriller, not once did it drag, the performances where as you would expect from Oscar winners and it had a fresh take on your typical crime thrillers. It is a brilliant remake of a well respected, if little known, Norwegian film. While not as revolutionary as Memento in its style, it is equally as watchable. This is not to be missed. 10/10",9,0,0,6 September 2002
X-Men," A great comic book adaptation!
","One of the best comic book movies created. This has since spawned a superior sequel but this really set the scene. There is a great bunch of interesting characters played well and in Hugh Jackman Hollywood has a potential new action man who can also act. While the action can sometimes not have the punch many fans would like it is still good and fairly big scale but you can't help feel that the makers were reigned in for this outing. The story is interesting and the characters are likeable. Ian Mckellan is superb and he makes his lines very memorable with his delivery. Patrick Stewart is perfectly cast and also like Mckellan really gives the film a class that many comic book adaptations lack. Hugh Jackman is superb as the charismatic and interesting Wolverine while Famke Janssen and Anna Paquin also impress. Many fans may feel disappointed at Cyclops miscasting and limited role, although he is somewhat rectified in the sequel. The ending doesn't quite thrill as much as it could, but this is still a worthy movie to watch. ***",8,0,0,23 July 2004
Sleepy Hollow," Tim Burton, a great visual genius!
","Fantastic genre blending horror movie from the master of darkness Tim Burton. This film is a visually striking fairy tale horror film with elements of romance and comedy. It is a  dark film but it is at the same time very tongue in cheek, and despite its gruesome moments it is not done in a nasty way. As usual Burtons visual style is very dark and gothic and once again he is working with Johnny Depp. Depp is fantastic in this film, he once again proves he is a very versatile actor and provides a faultless English accent and shows off his comical timing. Christina Ricci is also good as are the rest of the cast, particularly Miranda Richardson who is superb. Overall this is a very enjoyable film, it is a simple story based upon the old myth from America, of the headless horseman. Fantastic entertainment. ****",8,1,2,23 July 2004
Silent Hill," Avert your eyes children!
","Imagine if you will this situation: David Cronenberg, David Lynch, Dario Argento and Clive Barker all come together and do some bizarre sperm meld, they then fertilise with the egg of scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis and 9 months on a child is born. That child is brought up by a satanic cult. In then goes to film college and studies Russian expressionist cinema of the l940's and also Japanese and Italian horror. Then said child finds one of the dark lords home movies from the bowels of hell, he then brings it back to the surface and it disintegrates. Said child, now a young man had watched it while in the underworld though and decides to shoot his own version based of what he had seen. And there you have it Mr Christophe Gans born of fire and brimstone has re-created one of Satan's home movies, or at least that's what this film feels like. So critics naturally will hate this film because it's kind of warped and out there, and of course with the video game tag, they'd have made their mind up before even watching it. What many will fail to realise is that the Silent Hill games have a complex mythology, and some depth, it's not as Roger Ebert probably believes, something that the intellectually challenged will do, involving mindless hammering of buttons and blowing things up. Games have become quite intricate now, with some very filmic. Silent Hill was always a very filmic game and as such fans will appreciate this the most, while horror fans too will love the downright warped gruesomeness of this film. I'm not a big gamer and never really played SH much, but it's one I wanted to.In some ways the fact that critics will generally hate this, makes it better for the genre fans the film is aiming for, because it means it's gone all out and hasn't held back. True to Gans' word he's made the film look just like the game and this film has an incredible attention to detail. The world of Silent hill has three dimensions, the real, the ghostly quiet covered in sooty fog, and the hellish version overcome by rank and rust and inhabited by evil creatures. It's at the start of the film that leads us into this strange world. Rose Da Silva's adopted daughter Sharon is ill, and suffers episodes of sleepwalking. The film open's with parental horror 101, with Rose and husband Christopher desperately searching in the darkness of their back yard for their daughter. Eventually she is found standing on a cliff edge about to jump, but is saved just in time. The young girl was adopted from an orphanage just outside of Silent Hill, and dreams of this place regularly, feeling inexorably drawn to it. Rose against her hubby's wishes takes Sharon for a kind of therapeutic walkabout. That's when the fun starts and when Gan's summons his memory of Satan's home movie.While some critics have labelled the films plot nonsensical it's all pretty clear, in fact the few fuddys who had seen it before I went to view it myself have over-hyped the convolution and in the end I was expecting some Lynchian level of wha!? But no where close. Although there is plenty of Lynch coursing through this film, but mainly Cronenberg and Argento. If coming out the cinema feeling as if you've watched something you shouldn't have morally, and feeling like your eyes and ears have been abused by evil, then your gonna love this film. It seems some people went into this film intent not to listen, although in agreement the film is too long and some dialogue is whiffy.Gans first and foremost does a great job. The film looks stunning. It's crisply shot and there's all range of tracking, crane, dolly shots that make the film feel fluid. Some of the shots are downright superb. Following the much enjoyed Crying Freeman and Brotherhood of the Wolf, with their beautifully shot antitheses to most mindless Hollywood action films, Gans will feel the critical burn for the first time with his first two films on the most part receiving positive reviews. However I think on this occasion the fans vote will be what matters. Similarly Dan Laustsen once again combines with Gan's to make something gorgeous but similarly disturbing and creepy. While the music comes from Akira Yamoaka who did it for the games. The music works superbly in this film and doesn't feel like a generic and boring horror score.The cast are decent. Radha Mitchell is good as Rose, desperately searching for her daughter and she gives the movie a bit of heart. Elsewhere Laurie Holden is excellent as tough female cop Cybill. Also good support is added by a demented Alice Krige, and Kim Coates. Out of place somewhat is Sean Bean as Christopher. His character was certainly needed but still felt tacked in. The initial script didn't have him in and he was added at the studio's behest. Trouble is what could have been a 90 minute film is now a two hour film because of this, and while we needed that extra dimension and there were some interesting moments (such as Rose and Chris occupying the area in different dimensions and not seeing each other). Bean too gives his worst performance which is a shame cause he's always so reliable, but his American accent more than grates.Overall though this is one of those films you need a bath and a prayer after watching. It's unique, but mostly won't be appreciated for being so, and it's plain creepy. My brother wants the much touted Nightmare on Elm Street remake to be done by Gans as he has done this film, with such a big scope and so damn out there and it would be great to see, rather than doing a plain old slasher re-make not nearly as good. ***1/2",6,5,10,22 April 2006
The Expendables," Sly's time machine. Lets go back to the 80's!!
","Ever since the film was first announced, way back in November 2008, Stallone's action ensemble spectacular, The Expendables, has been in the forefront of every genre fans mind since. Starting with the triple casting of Stallone, Statham and Li, it was awesome enough. Then add Lundgren, Rourke, Austin, Couture, Gary Daniels and Eric Roberts, and it sent fans into delirium. Then throw in a dash of Bruce Willis and Ahnuld Schwarzenegger, and bed sheets in explosive action movie poster adorned bedrooms around the world, were soiled! So after a year and a half plus, of waiting, does it deliver? Yes! The plot is kept very simple. There's no real surprise in the film, but fans aren't here for storyline. Better too simple, than to make things too bogged down in convoluted sub-plot. Sly leads his team of good guys, against Eric Roberts team of bad guys. The mission goes wrong at first, leading to the capture of the beautiful Sandra, a native who acts as contact for Sly's band of mercs at the mission locale. Sly decides it's in his best interests to go back on perhaps a suicide mission, to try and save the girl. His team join him for the last harruh.The film is short and loaded with characters. As such there's not too much development on any of them, especially peripheral roles. Stallone is the glue that holds the film together. Sly has great chemistry with everyone here. There's a sense of vulnerability about Barney Ross, and a sense of personal struggle here. Stallone's hound dog eyes bringing the soul of the character through, despite little in the writing, or the mumbled dialogue that suggests it. Statham as Lee Christmas is also solid. His arc comes from a somewhat needless subplot with his on-off girl friend. That extends to little more than him coming back one day to find she has a new boyfriend, and then coming back later to find new boyfriend, has smacked her around. It's Frank Martin again in truth, with the deep raspy drawl and erratic Brit-American accent shift again in evidence. But I don't care, because Statham is badass and that's what counts. He's got presence. Jet Li seems utterly redundant in the film though. Serving little purpose and given no dimension.The characters, with limited arcs devoted to each, mean that the more theatrical roles stand out. Mickey Rourkes brief appearance is excellent as Tool, a former Expendable. Mickey gets to swoop in and steal all his scenes, and none more so than his monologue, that in part provides Ross a catalyst to risk it all to save Sandra, and his soul. Rourke nails it, giving Tool's character a sense of tragedy and poignancy. He's a ghost of a man now. By the same token, Dolph Lundgren manages to upstage his co-stars when he gets screen time. Gunnar Jensen is unpredictable, uncontrollable and difficult to read. In one hand he likes to play the joker, but there's darkness and intensity behind the façade. Years of too many drugs and too many kills have taken their toll, and Lundgren embodies the character brilliantly. Like Rourke, you just wish there was more, especially as Li, Crews and Couture (they do well with what little they have though) have even less depth and impact. Retrospectively, two or three could have been trimmed from the cast, to devote more time to Stallone and Statham's characters, and especially Rourke and Lundgren. Elsewhere Eric Roberts delivers a vintage Roberts bad guy. It's easy, yet perfect casting and he revels in chewing his scenery. Stone Cold adds menace, while B-movie veteran Gary Daniels delivers his best performance ever, with the benefit of having real direction for the first time. It's a small role but his performance reaches competence for the first time, while his fight with Li and Statham is memorable.The big selling point of this film of course, is action. There's plenty of it. The opening is all too brief, seemingly trimmed down, so an extended DVD release may deliver even more carnage. Still, it packs a punch and sets the violent tone of the film. Then there's an array of vehicular set pieces and fights, before the finale. The finale is what will really have 80's action fans cart-wheeling with joy. It's nearly half an hour of unrelenting, old school, carnage! Like a combination of Commando, Invasion USA, Red Scorpion and Rambo 2 and 3's end action scenes, it's insane, and brilliant. It's a total antithesis to most modern action films too. We've all the classics here, brutal fights, gung-ho attitude, explosions (and jumping away from) and although grounded, with a sense of unreal, Reagan era glee.In all, The Expendables delivers what fans will want. Unashamed, 80's style carnage. It's not one for the critics, who'll continue to judge on plot and character, and dismiss a need for a movie 20 years outdated, but it's for the fans and on the whole, will delight. There is a sense that dramatic moments are forced in, but that was also a trait of the 80's action film in any case, and the now completely unsurprising scene with Willis, Stallone and Arnold has lost any enigma for first time viewers, which is a shame. The scene is still a geeks delight though, and brimming with star power. Despite some faults, the film has plenty of star power and charm to ride on. In a strange way, the faults just seem to make it feel a little more 80's and add more to the charm. It's just great to watch an old school action film again, and to see a collection of tough guys doing their thing. The Expendables does what it says on the tin, and for that, Stallone deserves thanks and praise. Roll on the Extended cut on DVD!",9,19,42,9 August 2010
Blade II," The kick ass movie of the year!!!
","I have always thought that Blade was an underrated action classic and one of the coolest, most stylish action flicks ever and so the sequel filled me with excitement. I knew it would be bigger, badder and bloodier but my god it surpassed my expectations. Wesley is lightning in this film, even more than in Blade 1. He has more one-liners and opportunities for some humour and he delivers his lines with his usual charismatic class. Del Torro has basically taken the sort of style that Stephan Norrington used in the first film and charged it up to even more super cool levels, the soundtrack is also excellent and the vast array of weaponry on offer puts the first film in the shadows. Del Torros history of directing horro flicks plays well in this film, and also the visuals are suitably dank and lurid. The cinematography in this film is pure excellence. The fight sequences are brilliant. They are extremely well choreographed, frequent and suitably violent and gore filled. Also the new super Vampires known as Reapers really give the film a fresh edge it needed to have after the first film. Not since I saw Brotherhood of the Wolf have I come out of the cinema wanting a repeat viewing so badly. Its pure adrenaline, clapping of the hands, excellence from start to finish. Us Brits are not usually known to show are appreciation for a film too outwardly during its presentation but the whole audience were cheerin, laughing and applauding in ore at the movie. The few minor quibbles would be that despite the excellent special effects there was one scene, when Blade first encounters the bloodpack in a fight, which had a completely computer generated Wesley for a few moves which did not look to realistic but the rest of the effects were first rate and the action in the rest of the film made up for it. Its entertaining, mindlessly cheesy fun. Overall this gets a 7/10",8,0,1,29 March 2002
Alien," One word. Classic!
","One of probably the top five most influential Sci-Fi movies, another being Blade Runner. Both of which were directed by Ridley Scott. Making me wonder why he has not returned to the Sci-Fi genre which is far and away his most successful genre. It can be done, Spielberg returned to Sci-Fi recently with Minority Report too great success. This film is superb, it spawned a genre in itself and is still a big influence. Visually this is only matched by probably Scott's other big Sci-Fi movie Blade Runner. The designs and the sets by HR Geiger are fantastic and Scott more than ably makes them look even better. The film was deservedly a record breaking film when it first came out. The cast are brilliant, the film is surprising and fresh and very tense. Sigourney Weaver does well in her star making role, capturing the screen from her initial supporting part to becoming the centre of the movie to many peoples surprise. Even before people have seen the movie they have probably seen many of the iconic pieces of imagery. I can only add that men will drool over Sigourney's tight skimpy knickers at the end. *****",10,2,4,23 July 2004
Elf," Best Crimbo movie in years!
","The first lead outing for Will Ferrell is a rare thing for modern times. A nice Christmas film with some real Christmas spirit that is also genuinely good. It has the right balance of being nice and festive while also being funny. Recent years have seen a depressing lack in good Christmas movies, with many just being straight to video or being too childish, like The Grinch. At Christmas time we should have Christmas movies. They have dried up though and when you look at Christmas TV listings there is a big lack there. True most are not very good but the best ones should be shown.Elf is funny and charming. It's a nice, if derivative story. Seasonal films can rarely be all that original though. Elf however is better than most and has added in a few original touches. Will Ferrell is superb, he's full of energy, he has charm and I can see a great future for him. While seasoned SNL veteran's like Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy are faltering, Will is just launching himself and it looks like he could be a good leading man to rival the likes of Jim Carrey. He's a great comedian and a superb physical comic too. James Caan is good too and so is Mary Steenburgen but Ferrell absolutely steals the show.I look forward to Ferrell's future work and I think I may have to hire out Old School as well. ***1/2",8,0,0,13 December 2003
Taxi Driver," Brilliance!
","De Niro at his best. Scorsese at his best. Can't go wrong? Well no you can't. This is one of the greatest films ever. De Niro was robbed of the best actor award in the Oscars that year as was the film itself by Rocky, much as I love the Italian Stallions debut outing. This is a dark and murky character study of a sociopath and a loner who can't seem to find a way to vent his disgust at the world around him. It eats away at him until he finds some focus in a 12 year old prostitute, played excellently by Jodie Foster. Scorseses bleak and unreserved portrayal of New Yorks dark side is often graphic in visual and dialogue and often unsettling but the film is engrossing. It's full to the brim with darkness and pessimism about it's setting and it's central character who seems on a downward spiral until the end, when he finds some redemption thanks to Foster. De Niro is electrifying in a truly legendary performance, told mostly through De Niro's physical performance and telling a story through his eyes. Travis says little but we start to learn what makes him tick because of De Niro's brilliant performance. Also this has a brilliant and unique score.*****",10,0,0,23 July 2004
Lost in Translation," Bill Murray in a good movie again? Thank God yes!
","One of the films of last year in America, this came to our lovely British shores earlier this year. I have to admit I passed it by in theaters in preference of some more spectacle and action kind of fare. In truth I shouldn't have but this film does make great home viewing and doesn't lose anything whereas a big epic sort of film is always best viewed in the cinema. This marks a welcome return to form for Bill Murray as a leading man. Years have past since he did great films like Groundhog Day and it's a shame because he's a comical genius and a very good actor. As an actual actor I rate him higher than some of his comedy peers of his generation like Steve Martin and Dan Ackroyd. Murray is excellent in this film as actor Bob Harris, on the tail end of his popularity but on a commercial trip to Japan where he is still immensely popular (much like Hasselhof in Germany if you will.). So he is there earning money on making Whiskey adverts. He's bored, he's lost, he's in the middle of a mid-life crisis and is totally alone in a strange land. He then meets and starts a relationship with young, married Charlotte, played by Scarlett Johansson. Much has been made of Johansson with her success in this and Girl With a Pearl Earring and she is certainly one of the most promising young actresses around. She is uniquely gorgeous and has a distinct voice and very distinct looks, very beautiful eyes and lips and certainly is now a big Hollywood hotty. The film basically follows these two soul searchers as they spend time together and enjoy each others company. It's not sexual in any way initially, it's a pure friendship and there's almost a fatherly attitude from Bob. This film is very enjoyable. It's almost tragically funny at times and the characters are warm and likable. The biggest asset in this film is subtlety. The drama, comedy, direction, music and performances are all quietly contemplative and subtle. Sofia Coppolla, daughter of Francis (Godfather 1-3, Apocalypse Now) does a great job in directing this and as the scriptwriter she has created a heart warming and charming story of companionship through alienation. I loved the soundtrack in this too, all the music worked as did the scoring. This is most definitely one of the highlights of a primarily disappointing year. It's simplistic, not too taxing and nicely paced, it's just an immensely easy film to sit and enjoy. *****",10,1,2,16 September 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better than Menace!
","Possible Spoilers!
Firstly, Attack of the clones is a big, big, improvement on the dire Phantom menace, first and foremost is the fact that while relying on special fx thrills and action, as phantom did, the action itself is actually exciting. Phantom menace, aside from the uninteresting plot and sub-par acting, had rather lacklustre action that was just annoyingly cheesy or boring, or had an annoying 9 year old commentating on what he was doing, the only saving grace in my mind was the excellent pod race. What episode 2 does is take the major flaws of episode 1 and improve on them, the bad guy in this played by Christopher Lee is far more interesting than mute ninja Jedi Darth Maul from the first film, in that he has lines and is menacing to a degree more just than frowns, red face paint and a double ended lightsaber, which while cool in the eyes of a 6 year old really annoyed me, it just wasn't necessary. Anyway Episode 2 is much better but it still is a long way from being close to the original trilogy, what made the first three classics was the fact that it never set out to be a big blockbuster, it was a film Lucas wanted to make which was totally his vision and which he was catering for himself, producers thought it would fail but it didn't, it had charm, it was an adventure, it was remarkably ground breaking, the actors were great, the script was funny and exciting with an interesting story and the characters were likeable and held the screen. The two prequels have fallen in the blockbuster syndrome trap, they have purely ahead of anything else tried to make them gross as much as possible by loading them with cool special effects and stylish light saber action instead of trying to re-capture the style and the tongue in cheek charm of the original trilogy that marked them down in cinema history as classics. The prequels are more like action films than fantasy adventure, with Lucas and the producers thinking that a great action scene is loading the screen with computer generated effects and having the actors do karate and spinning their sabers around like a ninja, somewhere between return of the Jedi and Phantom menace Lucas has been inspired by Jackie Chan Movies, and I personally think it doesn't work, we don't want kung-fu in star wars we want Sabers being swung violently slicing through pillars, we want intermissions where an opponent hides waiting to strike, to build up tension. The action scenes are exciting, the special effects are exceptional but I find the action in the originals more exciting because I like the characters more, they didn't suffer a touch from effects overkill like the prequels have done, there are too many effects as great as they are, and at times they were overly ambitious with some shots.Anyway a simpler approach to voice my opinions will be to list good and bad points, there are in my book more bad but the good points outweigh the bad. Firstly the good. The action is great, the effects at times will blow you away, all the action scenes are exciting and in particular a scene shot in the rain between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett also towards the end when the Jedi's fight with Count Dooku's soldiers, it was manic but exciting. I think that Christopher Lee was very good as Dooku, we all know Mr Lee is one of the silver screens ultimate baddies and we know that he was gonna be a bad guy in this from minute one because you don't employ Christopher Lee to be the good guy. Also to a certain extent Ewan Mcgregor was good, he has improved since Phantom Menace and plays a more key role but you always feel like Ewans doing a two hour Alec Guiness impression which doesn't always work. Natalie Portman was good, she has been rather slated for being wooden inthis and Phantom but her character is like that, when Amidala expresses her feelings more, towards the end, Portman shines she also looks good holding a gun. Also Yoda fights, we finally see the little dude in action, unfortunately I saw this as downright hilarious, he hobbles around for the whole movie and is unable to travel more than 30 yards without using a floating platform and then all of a sudden he's jumping and flipping around the room like a muppet and acid. That was not terribly exciting but it did provide comic relief. So overall there is a big excitement factor here. Also its great to see little references to the originals such as the plans to the death star. Bad points, still no strong characters, this movies so needs a Han Solo, a Luke and a Leia but we don't have that, it lacks the great interplay they had, Ford damn carried those movies alone he was so good and to add to the class of them his support was excellent. Hayden Christianson didn't convince me, I don't rate him as an actor and I certainly cannot picture him as Vader. He delivered his lines too woodenly or too over the top while at times coming across like a petulant child. The dialogue was terrible, sure the lines in the Star Wars films are notoriously cheesy, so much so that Guiness hated spouting them, but they were fun, the comedy factor worked because of the chemistry on screen, this film and Menace completely lacked chemistry and any humour rarely hit the mark. Count Dooku is underused, also the plot has two many politicla sub-plots like Menace that are incoherent and I doubt youngsters will really follow, then again they will be there for the effects so they'll be happy. The plot was uninteresting, it didn't draw you in as the original trilogy did, it lacks classic twist such as `I am your father Luke' and the acting is also not very good, so far the casting of Anakin in both prequels have disappointed me. Just going back to the poor dialogue, it was everything said, such as the love scenes everything was cliche or just plain stupid and they have two many poor comedy attempts. There are some lines that were so bad that my head hurt, for instance Dooku says to Yoda, `it is obvious we both have equal powers in the force, we shall have to see who is more skilled at using a lightsaber'(or somethin like that) and the line was delivered like the dubbing of a 70's martial arts flick, if they had made Mr Lee look like he was dubbed it may have got some laughs, a missed opportunity I think. Some scenes really dragged, such as the dull love scenes in which no Chemistry was shown. The pacing was not great due to the fact that it is so difficult to direct a movie this heavily laden with CGI effects. Furthermore, the inclusions of C-3P0 and R2-D2 seem pointless, C-3P0 was no purpose at all so they use him as comic relief, unfortunately he has been really camped up and his lines are awful it just makes you secretly wish he gets blown to smithereens but we know that unfortunately he won't. R2 also has no purpose and for some reason it seems he downgrades over the years because in this film he can fly. That is another problem, the film like Phantom Menace has everything looking far more advanced than in the original three, you get the sleek designs in vehicles that are very 2000 and then in the originals there's the rather squarish looks of the 70's with some dodgy mullets to boot. Also Samuel L Jackson disappointed me somewhat, he is good with the acting but when they had him whip out his Light-saber(nothing dirty) and use it he look kind of over-awed at the fact he was in a Star Wars film and he was using one, he didn't use it too convincingly and I thought at any moment he was gonna start jumping for joy.Basically this film is enjoyable, it does take itself a little too seriously at times and suffers from it, aside from the action and effects there is nothing to write home about. This still falls far short of the originals and in the recent blockbuster wars between this, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings this pails in comparison to Frodo's adventure although for me it beats Potter, my advice is see it, it does make up for Phantom menace, and also leaves you wanting to see the next one to carry on the story for some conclusion, unlike menace where I really wasn't bothered, this is film no 2 of the year behind Panic Room, and I now look forward to the release of its rival Spiderman to the UK. 7/10",10,0,1,20 May 2002
Predator," Arnie Classic!
","I'm not a big Schwarzenegger fan, he is not a great actor, he knows no martial arts, he's not pretty (not that that matters to me but for the ladies) but he has been the no 1 action star since he first uttered the line 'i'll be back'. He now has competition from younger stars such as Vin Diesel and Mark Dacascos people like that and even Brendan Fraser and Tom Cruise all of whom have acting ability, looks and a certain charisma he lacks and with the rising standard now needed in action films he is looking like its game over for his action crown. No longer is it acceptable to be purely beefcake in a mass destructive movie. I cannot really watch his 80's films besides this and the Terminator as I feel 80's action films are all about damage and violence instead of acting and plot. The Predator though is great, sure it has moments that are very overly macho and typicle of 80's action but Mctiernan also incorporates a tense and chilling atmosphere and adds to that Arns best performance bar End of Days. THe film is not to plot orientated but more about the situation, and there also features an amazingly destructive action scene when Arn and his troops infiltrate an enemy base, there must have been a lot spent on that because it was superb. Arn delivers his lines well in this and is given a character who is required to be fairly stoic without being given too many cheesy lines and it seems Mctiernan may have given him guidance as to what he wanted from the character which you feel lacks in films like commando and running man and if you have seen running man you will know that the Austrian Oak was terrible in that especially the Helicopter scene which made me want to vomit. Predator is a classic and the big man steals the show without having to rely purely on flexing his pecks and snapping necks.",9,0,0,11 November 2001
Léon: The Professional," One of the greatest action films ever and so much more!
","Luc Bessons greatest Hollywood film and perhaps the best action film ever. This is an action film with a heart. It has an engaging plot, interesting characters and relationships that develop and also where a lot of action films fall short, it has brilliant acting. The film is so thrilling. It is desperately tragic and also funny, its exciting and chilling. How a film can be so diverse and work well is beyond me. At times you'll be nearing tears in moments of tragedy and they will be seemlessly followed by moments of heart warming humour. The cast are all very good. Jean Reno is brilliant as the rather simple minded foreigner who at the start of the film cannot read but can kill as effectively as an A-bomb. Natalie Portman puts in one of the greatest child performances ever, the greatest in my opinion would be Haley Joel Osment in the Sixth Sense the film which should have earned him an oscar, and only his age perhaps denied him of that. Portman has rightfully been launched as a top actress since this film, including parts in the Star Wars saga which is the dream job of many an actor/actress and wannabe film star. Also in a scene stealing show is the versatile actor Gary Oldman, he is scary as the corrupt police officer with a drug problem, Oldman is so beleivable I'd almost be too scared to meet him if the chance were to arrise. This film is a definite classic. The action scenes are very good and the music is also great. You'll laugh, cry and be on the edge of your seat in this movie. The developent of the relationship between Leon and Matilda is engrossing, it never drifts into the realms of Lolita, it seems more like they see each other as family despite the fact Matilda is enfatuated with Leon. This film is a must see! 10/10",10,0,1,9 May 2002
The Bourne Identity," Great, old fashioned spy film!
","This is a slick, intelligent and enjoyably old fashioned spy flick. In modern times, good conspiracy/espionage thrillers have been few and far between. Some decent ones have included Spy Game, Enemy Of The States and Mission Impossible. While these were good and atmospheric there was something rather overblown and typically Hollywood about all of them, from very convoluted storylines, to over the top action scenes. The didn't seem grounded in reality. The Bourne Identity does however. It is far more believable as a piece of conspiracy entertainment.The plot is fairly simple. It's a one-dimensional story in a good sense, in that it follows a clear pattern from start to finish without digressing too much into other storylines. The sub-plots don't tend to interfere with the main plot. The story involves Jason Bourne. He is found at sea, floating unconscious with two bullets in his back and a laser pen in his leg, that when shone upon a wall for example, shows the address of a bank in Switzerland and also an account number. When he is pulled out of the water by fisherman he is near death but is saved, however when he is recovered, a problem still remains. He has no memory of who he is. He does things instinctively that ordinary people wouldn't, like speak several languages, martial arts, and he wants to know why. So Bourne starts at the bank, the address of which was implanted in his thigh. The plot basically follows Bourne thusly on a quest to discover who he is and more importantly what he does for a living that requires him to be proficient in martial arts, weapons training, escape tactics and also requires about twenty different passports with different names (which confuses him no end). Along the way he employs Marie (Franke Potente) to drive him from Switzerland to Paris (after discovering he lives there). At the same time it turns out that they have been targeted by the CIA for termination, because Bourne as it turns out was a hired assassin who botched a very hush, hush job and so when he suddenly turns up alive (he was assumed dead) they want him out the picture for reasons of national security and to save their own bacon (the planned hit was not authorised from the top shall we say). The way the plot unfolds is excellent. We are always a step ahead of what Bourne knows and there are plenty of twists along the way and the film is excellently placed.What I love about this film is that it evokes memories of spy flicks from the 60's films from the likes of Frankenheimer and great films like the Ipcress File that are far more grounded than escapist spy films like Bond. Director Doug Liman has done a great job here. The film is old fashioned spy thriller with a modern edge to it. The European, wintry locations create a great atmosphere. Particularly in France which really evokes the feeling of a Frankenheimer film. The action is good too, including a superbly staged escape from the Swiss Embassy, which has some lovely intelligent touches (he steals a radio from a guard to listen in on security to keep one step ahead of them while they chase him, and he tears a map of fire exits off the wall a studies it as he goes along). There is also a great car chase, reminiscent of the Italian Job (he's driving a Mini) and once again the lovely touch of having him study a map quickly before he decides to accelerate away from on coming police, there are great touches like this throughout that give us an indication of how a CIA hitman might be trained to think and act beyond an average citizen).The cast are good. Matt Damon makes a good action man here, particularly as the part requires a level of relatability that you wouldn't get from an action star. His performance is good and as Bourne he is likeable and we are along for the ride as he aims to discover who he really is. Damon is cool here, the part gives him ample opportunity to kick ass and he does with gusto. Also starring is Franke Potente as his initially apprehensive right hand man (or woman should I say). I'm a fan of Potente, I love her accent and she has a great, particularly non-Hollywood, presence. She really caught my eye on Run Lola Run, a great film and she is good here. Also good are Chris Cooper and Brian Cox as CIA big-wigs who may have bitten off more than they can chew and could find themselves in hot water should Bourne suddenly turn up at head-quarters. Hence they go to great lengths to bump him off.All in all a great old fashioned thriller. It's well paced, exciting, clever and leaves you wanting to see more. The may have given in to a Hollywood ending (the very last scene, the wind-down) but overall it's one of the thrillers out in years. ****",9,0,1,15 March 2004
The Italian Job," Surprisingly sharp and entertaiing movie.
","An all star cast keep the revs up in this top draw remake of Michael Caines cult classic. The film is a simple storyline with some good characters and the script is quite witty and sharp.Mark Wahlberg takes the lead and does well, he is ably supported by Charlize Theron, Donald Sutherland and Seth Green and Ed Norton appears as the bad guy of the picture. The pacing is good as the climactic heist builds up and is planned and there is some intelligence and imagination in how they pull it off.The action is exciting and director F Gary Gray shows some real flair. The chase and heist scenes are very good. Overall this is one of the surprises of the summer, a surprise critical and box office hit. ***1/2",8,0,3,18 July 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Best film I have seen!!, and I've seen some greats!
","As a fan of fantasy films since my child hood I have eagerly awaited this film since I first heard it was being released, I remember being read the books when I was younger and being enthralled although I remember nothing from them. Fantasy films have sets and costumes that build magical worlds that the audience can be lost in but of all of them bar Star wars, none have been exceptional and all flawed in some way. I like the sword and sorcery slant more than anything else but have never had a film that nowadays I could look at critically and call excellent. My favourite film of all time is Masters of the Universe, no other film filled me with such excitement as that did, but it is majorlly floored, other favourites include Legend a film that visually was breathtaking but that was about all it was. Anyway this is the complete article. Visually this is the greatest film ever from the sets, effects down to the amazing and groundbreaking effects. Some of the flowing camera movements are vertigo inducingly brilliant, an example could be the opening battle scene as the camera sweeps through hordes of battling soldiers falling off cliffs or bludgeoning each other as the camera takes us through the battle fields. Peter Jackson's direction is dynamic and at times breathtakingly brilliant. The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end throughout this film, I was lost in middle earth for three hours thanks to Jackson's mastery, his imagination obviously running rampant in the designing of the characters, worlds etc based on nothing more than descriptive story telling and perhaps a few odd sketches. I am glad I decided not to bring in any popcorn or sparkling beverage as an unwelcome need to go pee-pee may have resulted in me wetting myself and the fellow viewers either side of me parting like the red sea from the subsequent whiff. Apart from the amazing visuals the films story is imaginative and engaging but what do you expect from a classic fictional epic like Tolkiens Lord of the Rings trilogy, and Jackson as far as I know has stayed faithful to the story but of course needing to cut down a few moments of the piece and of course these will go noticed by some to varying degrees of noticability because of course everyone has their own ideas of what parts of a book they have read is important compared to somebody else's opinion. What is great about Tolkiens world, and characters is they are universally compatible, you don't need to have read the books to fully enjoy this, its easy enough to pick up, good versus evil and we get an opening story telling about the rings creation as well as other things of importance. The actors are all well cast here, and all of them perform excellently. Elijah Wood is very good in the lead; he manages to hold the film together in such a big role where others may have lost it to the supporting cast. Ian Mckellan is also brilliant as the wizard Gandalf and others who impress are Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, John Rhys Davies, and a very good Sean Bean in a key role and all the others in this film performed to a level bettering anything I have seen them in. Worthy of note are the two main females the gorgeous Cate Blanchett as the wise and at times scary elf queen, and the impossibly attractive Liv Tyler who must surely have silenced unfair criticism with this performance, she is exceptional in this. She is sexy, tough, gentle and she steals the screen whenever she is on it, simply said she looks hot! One person I have not yet mentioned is Viggo Mortensen who plays Aragon; he for me was narrowly the star of the film. Viggo makes an excellent action hero in this and his performance is outstanding, I genuinely believe he is worthy of Oscar consideration for this film. The only minor fault of the film I would say is the end, because being only a third of the story of course there is no conclusion so it ends all so suddenly. Like pulling a bottle of milk from a baby's mouth when he was only half done I felt mildly annoyed and desperate to see part two, and considering I have to wait a year, I became equally desperate to watch the film again. I do feel that a whole year is a lengthy time to wait and I can see it as nothing more than a marketing ploy to build demand and expectation for the sequel. Anyway Christmas time has once again become an exciting time for me thanks to the Lord of the rings trilogy. Also excellent about this film would have to be the ear poundingly good sound effects, they were astounding. This added to the feeling of the film and like for instance Gladiator this film is one you just have to see on the big screen. I give this a definite 10/10 and it is number one in my mind. What excites me the most is that the sequels are supposed to get better and better. Bring on number 2.",10,0,0,3 January 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," The Matrix trilogy has closed. Satisfying? Yes and no.
","Reloaded had its problems, so having been shot back to back this was bound to have certain problems too. Not so much similar problems in this instalment, whereas Reloaded essentially forgot that the first movies philosophical and religious reference was in subtle sub text, Reloaded brought it to the forefront of the movie in a rather ostentatious manner. The pacing and the dialogue was also a problem. In Revolutions however there are still problems with pacing and even more so with dialogue but there is a lot less philosophising.The two sequels essentially take on a hole different tone to the first movie. They don't feel like the same movie. When watching the first film there is no way of guessing where the next two will take the story and characters. It is quite an imaginative and at times exciting journey but understandable that many fans don't feel satisfied. The Matrix had one of those great endings leaving it wide open for another but looking back now having seen the two sequels I feel it would have been better off as a stand alone film, I mean much as I would love to see a continuation of Blade Runner it is a film that is best as a film of its own. What it boils down to in some ways is that the story the Wachowski's are trying to tell in the final two instalments are very complex ideas, essentially twice as much movie material than the running times of both together. It feels way to much like the two sequels have crammed information in, they've been cramming so much into the films, and the game and the Animated films, yet still the explanations need such time for the audience to fully understand that come the resolution of the final chapter you still feel you don't now enough about the Matrix, the relationship between the humans and the machines, Neo's purpose, Agent Smith's role and purpose, the Oracle. You get a basic gist of most of it but you never quite feel satisfied enough about certain characters roles, objectives and so on.These are the major gripes but at the end of the day the two sequels are still enjoyable action movies, they do have their slow points but then most action films do. The action is still fantastic. This has the awe factor of the second but this time I felt more emotionally involved. The battles in Zion are amazing, great displays of CGI. The CGI in this film is superb. The level of detail is amazing, the Machines city is particularly jaw dropping. Also the much touted super brawl between Smith and Neo is something to behold. There is no doubt that while the Wachowski's have had problems with the scripts of the last two they have not lost their visual style and their unique imagination. The fight that ends the trilogy is perhaps the best, it is not as emotionally involving as the fights in the first film due to story and character problems but for sheer spectacle they are astounding. The fight reminiscent of Dark City's final showdown but on acid, is just very exciting not to mention the fact that it really does look cool.The cast are good although for about a third of the movie Keanu Reeves and Carrie Ann Moss disappear from the film while the battle of Zion takes place. Reeves is more than ever a little bit wooden but Laurence Fishbourne is back on form from the last film. Also Jada Pinkett Smith has a much better role than the last film too and she is looking very sexy. Also Ian Bliss is excellent as Bane, his impersonation of Agent Smith is superb. Of course the man himself Agent Smith played by Hugo Weaving steals the show. On a minor point Monica Bellucci is sadly wasted in a very brief one line role, although she does stick in the mammary, I mean memory for other reasons, I nearly shouted out `Holy Wazoombas Batman!' in the cinema, thankfully I didn't.Despite some flaws and the feeling it has been needless, I liked the much debated resolution to the story, and there were shocks in it and deaths for two major characters. I just wish I was 100% clear about the whole trilogy, I imagine the only ones to fully grasp everyone that has happened or been implied would be the writers themselves. It seems in some ways the two sequels are just too big, they seem so different from the subtle and self contained original. To sum up the original to me is endlessly repeatable and can be read in so many different ways, thanks to the intelligent scripting, while the sequels are good, they have some depth but the way the stories are told in two and three are problematic and the films will not be anywhere near as repeatable. Overall this is a good cinema going experience but still in the context of the first movie, sadly lacking. ***",6,0,0,8 November 2003
The Thing," Supertastic.
","John Carpenter was probably the man to beat during the late 70's and early 80's in terms of horror flicks, and ranking as his greatest film, is most certainly the Thing. This is a creature horror, a genre that rarely hit's the mark, but most memorably perhaps with this film, and Ridley Scott's Alien, a few years previously (for the best recent example, check out The Descent). The Thing also ranks as Kurt Russell's greatest cinematical moment. This came shortly after Carpenter himself had helped Russell expunge himself from his longstanding Disney poster boy image (In Escape From New York). Indeed the collaborations of Carpenter and Russell always hit the mark, and established Russell as one of the coolest, cultest, action guys of the 80's.Here the story centres around RJ MacReady (as cool a name as you'll get in cinema, perhaps seconded only to Snake Pliskin) and his workmates stationed out in a remote scientific research station in the Antarctic. When a chopper carrying Norwegian's from a nearby station fly's over their airspace, while shooting at a husky, something seems amiss. The Norwegians seem intent on destroying the seemingly innocent dog, and after inadvertently blowing up their own chopper and wounding one of the American men, the remaining Norwegian is shot down. When MacReady and Co take a look at the remains of the Norwegian camp they discover it all but destroyed with no survivors and only a hideously mutated carcass, and a huge crater. As the film progresses we soon discover that the camp was destroyed by an alien shape-shifter, that absorbs the bodies it contacts and takes over that form (the dog, and then down the line the crew members). The genius in The Thing is, from a certain point on, Carpenter builds up the tension between the American crew. No one trusts anyone, and sanity is pushed to the limit. One by one they all get killed by the Alien, or by each other. Above the amazing special FX in this film it's the human interaction that creates the most tension. Kudo's to JC for creating a really intelligent horror.As mentioned the FX are amazing. All the creature FX are top class, and of course done long before CGI came and reared it's ugly head. The FX in this, by Rob Bottin, and also Stan Winston, outdo anything I've seen done in a computer with creature makeup etc. The film is pretty creepy and gruesome at times with some nightmarish imagery, and Carpenter pulls off some brilliant jump scares in the film, some of the most perfectly set up and timed scares ever committed to film.The cast are excellent. There's a host of characters and in the support of Russell, Wilfred Brimley and Keith David are particularly good. Kurt Russell though is the man, playing his role superbly as an actor and as an action man. People seem too quick to remember Willis, Stallone and Schwarzengger as the 80's action gods, when Russell preceded them all. Russell is after all one of the few people to ever successfully pull off the mullet.Carpenter has never exceeded his work here. It's brilliantly paced, shot and edited and Carpenter has a control over proceedings that exceeds all his other work. Aided also by a fantastically uncharacteristic score by Ennio Morricone, who does a very Capenteresque score, and something that is fully of eerie menace. This is without doubt one of the best of its genre. *****",10,1,2,23 November 2006
Pitch Black," Are you afraid of the dark?, I am now!
","I watched this after seeing Fast and Furious which instantly made me a fan of Vin Diesel purely because he is an action star with acting ability, a distinctive voice well suited to the genre and impeccable timing of his line delivery. In Pitch Black he excellently plays the likeable baddie Riddick with a frightening menace and charisma. THe film was only 22 million but this doesn't show woth the superb speccial effects that put some big budget films to shame. Aswell as the effects there is a decent atmosphere to the film and Twohys direction was excellent. All in all I highly recommend this it is simply put a sci-fi classics. One other thing to add, Vin is the number 1 action star in my book.",9,0,0,10 November 2001
Little Miss Sunshine," Absolutely brilliant.
","Very rarely are we treated to a film so brilliantly scripted, directed and acted. It's a sad, sad fact nowadays. We can enjoy the odd Hollywood movie that makes the grade in some way, but inevitably it's some sequel, or remake of something that in the end, lacks any real sort of magic. In the last few years, Fox Searchlight have delivered three shining beacon's of simplistic, original, challenging, and insightful little comedy dramas. Those being Lost in Translation, The Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind, and now of course, Little Miss Sunshine. Three great movies, devoid of any of that formulaic, saccharine, Hollywood taste, that in large doses soon becomes inedible. This film marks a great antithesis to the blockbuster, and the lazily produced.Little Miss Sunshine follows a dysfunctional (that's the polite way to put it) family, as the go on a cross country road trip, to take younger member Olive to the Little Miss Sunshine convention to compete. The family is an eclectic and completely diverse mix, with polar opposites including a heroin addicted, highly opinionated grandfather, to a wannabe pilot son, whose taken a vow of silence, right over to the homosexual and recently outed uncle, a teacher, who failed in a suicide attempt following the spurned love of a male student. Relationships are at breaking point, and require repair, and a cross country road trip, may or may not be the medicine to heal the rifts.This really is a sharp, satirical, poignant, and witty movie, that is aided by a superb cast. Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette play mum and dad superbly, with Kinnear excellent as the self help guru, unable to help anyone because his nine steps programme is yet to be distributed to the masses, and Collette equally good as the work horse mother, trying to hold everything together in the face of manic depressive relatives, and a lack of income. Of great importance was the casting of Olive. She's the centrepiece of the film, as the sweet young Olive, un-hindered by the adult, or adolescent affliction's affecting her family. She is in fact the normality, and the one who stops everything falling apart, the one that all the family would do anything for. When a young person is so prevalent in a film, it is essential to cast a child who can handle the role, with roles this challenging very hard to cast. However Abigail Breslin (who impressed immensely in Signs, at only six years old) is fantastic. She's being hyped up now as the new Dakota Fanning (as if Fanning is now somehow on the scrapheap or past it!?) and in terms of talent rightly so. She's adorable here and gives a fantastically genuine performance. Paul Dano too is excellent as the Nietzsche inspired Dwayne, the troubled teen. Highly impressive as well is Steve Carell. Known thus far for his comical turns in more the Ferrell, Carrey, kind of mugging genre, Carell proves a great crossover actor (like Jim Carrey). Carell's performance is superb, and his choice of roles beyond this will suddenly expand from those that simply require him to gurn for the camera. And finally as the grandfather, is the always classy, Alan Arkin, who has been off the Academy radar for far too long. He is fantastic here, and must, simply must, be a shoe-in for a best supporting actor nomination. Arkin adds a 40+ years of experience and Gravitas to the role.Directing duo Jonathon Dayton, and Valerie Farris, both do a brilliant job. Things are kept simple. It's all about capturing an atmosphere, a mood, and the performances. It's an 8 million dollar movie, that is infinitely more captivating than anything this year, or last year, that is simply about performance and material. There's no hindrance of CGI, of spectacle. It's crisply and simply shot, focusing on the actors. Hollywood I hope is learning that a price cannot be put on directing, acting and scriptwriting of the highest order, now that big hollow blockbusters are starting to disappoint with their box office return.Little Miss Sunshine is quite simply a fantastic achievement in the aspects that really matter in film-making. It's at this current time, the film to beat this year. *****",10,4,9,5 October 2006
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," For me the series goes from best to the worst (but still good!)
","This is a definite return to form for Arnie and his first box office hit (maybe, depending on the drop off) and critical hit since ironically his last outing as the T-800, in T2. Yes True Lies was a box office hit but critically the response was very mixed, although fairly good in Britain. This is also his best since True Lies, it has more in the way of story but the action doesn't quite come up to Jim Cameron standard (little does!).
Before going on about the strengths of this film I'll comment on the weaknesses. The film has a lot to live up to, and in the end fails to live up to the first two films, while it is still a worthy sequel. Some of the significant weaknesses are the fact that the story is not as interesting or clever, it doesn't have as much character development, although in John's case it does however the other roles are weaker than Sarah Conner and previously Kyle Reese. There is only one prominent 3 dimensional role. As I say Claire Dane's role as Kate Brewster is underwritten and subsequently she is wasted, for instance her fiance is killed by the TX and it has little effect on her, it is not touched upon and is forgotten within five minutes, then the developing relationship between her and John gives her an air of coldness. The thrills lack the excitement and punch of the first two, which is not to say they aren't exciting, but hey its up against Jim. The final action scene is the weakest of all three films and is semi rehashed from the first film. The main problem is that the humour of the film is not as subtle as number 1 or two. It seems that as the franchise has moved along the humour has increased, but here it is bordering on spoof.
Another key problem is that Arnie no longer is the head of the movie, he doesn't command the screen like he used to, and his role seems to be that of the Terminator doing an impression of the Terminator, funny as it is to see him send himself up slightly, the humour is far to overt and corny. There doesn't seem to be a need for Arnies character in this one (in terms of the way it is written rather than his overall impact in the story, he still has to save them but aside from that his presence is solely about laughs), the TX is a great adversary and once again Arnie plays protector but his role still wasn't 100% pivotal. T1 and T2 with no Arnold and they would be half of what they are, he held the movies together, his role is written with so much comedy involved that he seems like a caricature, it thankfully doesn't affect his dramatic moments too much though. Some other problems are the disappointing impact of Arnies change from good to bad, this could have been much more exciting, in the end it is very brief and lacks punch. Also the future war scenes that gathered much fan interest before the films release are very small and no more than the first two films, I would liked to have seen more because the idea excited me, that is not too big a problem though as it is bound to happen in the next instalment. To round it off into one sentence, it doesn't feel like the Terminator films that Jim Cameron weaned us on! Also Beltrami's score isn't as memorable as the synthy resonance of Brad Fiedels scores. The score seemed fairly cliched and not as inspirational as some of Marcos other work.Okay my disappointments out the way, and I was a little disappointed at the film considering the early reviews suggested it was going to be very, very good, I found much to enjoy. John Connors role is good and Nick Stahl plays it well, in fact he holds the movie, and this is vital considering the minimal scripting of the other characters, mind you the major focus on him is warranted of course. The action is good, a little over hyped maybe, such as the supposed 15 minute car chase that must have been 5 at most. Even though the film doesn't seem like a 200 million budget there is still plenty of bang for your buck. The TX rocks. Kristanna Loken looks amazing and she looks like a bad ass bitch, she has made a great movement of her own for the TX. She overdoes it at times but she really steals the movie and steals Arnies thunder. The script is pretty good, especially compared to most actioners, it does suffer from some bad dialogue but even the classic first two films had its moments, what action film doesn't? Of course one of the main things was that it was great to see Arnie back in a big action movie kicking some ass, delivering zingers (that were very Commando, very True Lies, a bit too hokey for the Terminators, but still funny) and handling large weaponry, who else but Arnold could walk out with a coffin full of weapons on one shoulder and a large calibre weapon in the other hand and single handedly  wipe out a squad of police vehicles. With a 150 (at least) plus gross under his belt he now will have better options open to him rather than pap like Collateral Damage. There are smiles on the faces of Ah-nuld fans once more with his first truly decent film in nearly ten years (I don't care what critics say True Lies was the dogs bollocks in terms of mindless fun). T3 will be a worthy edition to any action fans DVD collection, and despite Mostow perhaps overstretching himself, going from a 40 million to a 200 million budget production, he is still looking like a top new director coming through, although as its only his third big film in 6 years he needs to accelerate the releases. Most definitely a worthwhile sequel but it falls far short of the first two. Bring on number 4 baby. ***1/2",7,0,0,18 July 2003
"I, Robot"," Top movie!
","In a year that has generally been disappointing in terms of the big budget films. It finally seems that the 2nd half of the year could be getting better. Spidey's second outing was excellent, while Bourne Supremacy and indeed this have been good. Far eclipsing earlier big budget limp, flops, Troy, Chronicles Of Riddick, Passion Of Christ, King Arthur and Van Helsing. The bad films still though outweighing good films like Spidey, and Harry Potter three. Still overall this year, like last year has had a good amount of good films, largely made up from the smaller films like Shaun Of The Dead, Lost In Translation and School Of Rock. There is a promising list of upcoming films coming out from directors like Oliver Stone, Michael Mann and also Terry Gilliam, so overall I can't really be too disappointed at this year's standard. Indeed it's almost up at last year's level, but last year had Return Of The King to really up it. I suppose the lack of any new middle earth adventures was always going to make it a difficult year to be able top 2003. Anyway as a fan of Alex Proyas, whose earlier works The Crow, and Dark City are personal favourites, I was looking forward immensely to this film. Now I truth be told, after the first proper trailer, I was nervous. The first footage trailer, not the spoof NS5 advert, did kind of make it look as if the film would suck, and be a brainless blockbuster, but then again that was a similar problem with the Dark City promotion. The trailers after that improved immensely thankfully while still leaning towards the blockbuster angle. The film has blockbuster elements but has more too it, hence the above average ratings compared to your usual action extravaganza. I Robot is a very good film. It's good fun, it's exciting and despite feelings that it has picked bits from superior similarly science fiction films like the Terminator and Minority Report, it's good stuff. Now this is nowhere near as good as Proyas's early works but still it has some depth and raise questions without really having the philosophical rich textual side that his films The Crow, Dark City and indeed classics like Blade Runner, Minority Report and The Matrix had. They were films that can be vastly repeated for the literary, biblical and philosophical references and the great touches. While I-Robot raises interesting questions and has some biblical and sociological connotations, they are questions raised in many other films. It does not seem original, but then again many of the films raising points which appear in this film were inspired by the short stories of Isaac Asimov who wrote the original story this film was based off. All his stories revolved around technology and robots in particular and were based around the three laws of robotics. 1 a Robot will not harm a human being. 2. A Robot must obey a human at all time except when it conflicts with the first law and 3, A Robot can defend itself unless it conflicts with the first two laws. These laws that Asimov created are essential in this film and they are key to how the plot of I-Robot transpires. The plot revolves around Del Spooner. He's a cop who has a deep dislike for Robots and despairs that at this time (2035) humans have become very dependant on them. When the creator of the NS-5 robots and all robots, apparently commits suicide, Spooner is called in to investigate. He is suspicious of the death and believes it could be a murder but since the room that doctor Lanning was in when he jumped was locked and no-one else was in it, bar some Robot's, Spooner believes it must have been a Robot. His prejudice drives him throughout his investigation; he suffers from tunnel vision in his pursuit of bringing down this Robot and in effect the whole lot of them. It is only later as the plot unfolds he looks at the whole picture and realises his actions have been wrong. The main suspect is a seemingly malfunctioning Robot, who calls himself Sonny and seems to have developed human emotions. Sonny is found at the crime scene, hiding when Spooner investigates and fleas from the scene. Later Spooner has him in for questioning and is very suspicious at how Sonny is behaving. As the plot transpires, he begins to suspect Lawrence Robertson, Lanning's partner, of involvement in Lanning's death considering it was on the eve of a massive launch of a new NS-5 that will be in nearly every home in America. As the film progresses Spooner begins to uncover the reasoning behind Sonny's emotions and uncovers a frightening truth. The plot is clever and develops well as it seems a glitch in the 3 laws means trouble for the human race as the Robot's AI's develop.The cast are good. I like Will Smith but I was weary of his casting here. Would it be too Will Smith, as the trailers suggested? Well this is some typical Will talk but Smith does well with a character given some depth. It's a good role that makes up for his two previous disappointing sequels to Bad Boys and Men In Black. It's his best performance since his Oscar nod for Ali. Bridget Moynahan is also good as Robot psychologist Susan Calvin who works for NSR and ends up supporting Spooners investigations after initially believing he was paranoid. Also there is good support from Bruce Greenwood and Chi McBride. However, Alan Tudyk steals the show as Sonny, or should I say Tudyks vocal performance. The robots were a worry in this film because they could have been overdone and they have such cool robots like The Terminator to contend with. The robots are portrayed well in this and especially the most worrying one, Sonny. His character is very good though, and intriguing. His creator has spent time making Sonny unique from his brothers and he develops emotions, has dreams. It raises questions about whether a robot which has essentially it's own soul now and acts and re-acts like a human should have the rights to a proper existence. Sonny has malfunctioned and is to be dismantled but essentially his human characteristics and three thinking could argue that he has a right of existence. After all if a human was in a vegetative state and showed little signs of a soul they would still have a right of existence. Anyone who worried about the portrayal of this robot would be pleasantly surprised. This is largely because Tudyk nails the character so well and makes him very likeable and sympathetic. Alex Proyas is on fine form, and while it isn't him at his wild, dark and goth best he still shows he is definitely a director to look out for. I just hope he doesn't become a director for hire to do blockbusters every 1 or 2 years. I want his next to be meaningful and personal like Dark City and Crow, which were more moderate budget and probably with more creative freedom. A hit like I Robot can only help his choices for his next movie. Visually Proyas has shown he is one of the best in the business.  Visually this is good. Not as wild and expressionistic as his other two films but still good. The cinematography is good and crisp with good use of colour and shadow. The production design is based around a future where everything barring the robots is similar to today. It's essentially the present with a little polish a few sliding doors and NS-4's walking your dog. The production design doesn't seem entirely original; it has similarity to Minority Report, including the cars and the general design in architecture. The Robots are nicely designed. It's an interesting design, very similar to Bjork's music video All Is Full Of Love, extremely similar, to the point you feel that the robots are ripped off, but still it's their debut in the world of movies so I'm not to bothered, the problems are surely between the designers of that music video and this movie. The special effects are outstanding, top of the range. The way the robots integrate into crowds of people are impressive and also Proyas uses the visual effects superbly as he did in Dark City. The action here is also great stuff. What you want form a summer movie is spectacular action, style and thrills and you get that. To be honest the film loses a little when it goes into action overdrive in the last half hour. I generally thought that the first hour and a half as the plot develops was the best. Generally Sci-Fi films are stronger in the opening and have most of their action near the end, look at The Matrix, Minority Report. I always love the exposition in these movies.  Also kudos to Marco Beltrami who does a good job composing here. The score could have just ripped off many other sci-fi films but it does something that has a unique style and has if anything similarities at times to the score of Dark City. Proyas must have had input in to the score.Overall this is a decent sci-fi movie. Rarely are sci-fi movies very good but this is certainly one of the better in recent years. While it doesn't stand up to the best ones like Terminator, Alien, Blade Runner and Minority Report it is good in its own right and that is first and foremost all you can ask for from a summer blockbuster. ****",9,3,4,25 July 2004
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," A great action film, one of the best!
","Is this better than T1? Well in my opinion not quite. Arnold is the Terminator and it wouldn't have been the same if he hadn't returned, but I always feel he is better as the bad guy, and I liked the dark eerie style of the first film. This film does however feature some insanely massive set pieces and the action is upped from the originals 6 million budget to this films 100 million budget. Cameron's direction is tense and the imaginative story once again is made simple to allow for the characters to hold the movie rather than a complex plot. Arnold again dominates the screen with his presence while Robert Patrick is equally menacing as the advanced model the T-1000. This movie features some groundbreaking effects and still looks fantastic 11 years after its release. *****",10,2,2,23 July 2004
Van Helsing," OTT!!!
","Stephan Sommers, responsible for the simplistic, high action, low plot, and mildly diverting Mummy series, continues his love of the B-movie and monster movie with this CGI laden action fest. Van Helsing is about the legendary mythical Vampire Hunter and Sommer's not only pits him against Vampire, but Werewolves, Harpies, Frankenstein's monster and Dr Jekyll and his alter ego, Mr Hyde. Already you can tell that this film is all about the action.This is a mildly diverting and occasionally spectacular movie but at the end of the day it's forgettable and hollow, despite the superb Jackman. Hugh Jackman plays the titular hero and as he was in X Men and Swordfish, he makes an engaging and charismatic action hero, thanks to that extra bit of acting ability that traditional action stars don't usually have. Co-Starring is the sex-tastic Kake Beckinsdale who is ravishingly good as Van Helsings not so damsel in distress, love interest. The problem with this film is that despite being huge in scale, it just doesn't engage the audience. It's almost too big for it's boots and lacks the wit and rollicking enjoyment value of The Mummy. There are too many elements, It's like adding more spices than you need to a perfectly good curry and ruining the flavour. Whereas as The Mummy was a nicely spiced Chicken Jalfrezi, this is a Prawn, Chicken, Lamb and Beef, Tikka-Massalla-Bhoona-Dhansak (I know my curries!). Something full of elements that should work, but in the end don't. Sommers loses grip and in the end seems to be at the computer screen whacking off in delight at all the techno wizardry before him and as such we get over the top action sequences, CGI crane shots and just too much sugar coating for something that was far to sweetened to begin with. It's teeth rotting stuff this and you'll leave with a stomach ache for sure. That's enough of the food analogies, I'm getting hungry but basically this really is an excessive and ultimately wasteful exercise in making a movie purely for the box office receipts. This has its moments but is a waste of a talented cast, with Jackman in particular not given enough to do. **",5,1,2,1 November 2004
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Funny and Sweet! This is the making of Carell.
","The ,marvellous year of movies continues and yet another superb comedy film is added to the pantheon of great films for 2005. Judd Apatow writes and directors this story of a 40 year old virgin who is taken under the wing of a group of male co-workers in order to get him laid.The simple premise works well and of course it has your usual romantic comedy patterns, with Andy falling in love with Trish, a 40 something grandmother, looking for love. Andy is a nice guy who has not had much luck with women, but as the film progresses he discovers that maybe sex just isn't as important as people make out.This is a nice sex comedy and Andy is very amiable played superbly by Steve Carell who will surely hit it big after this movie. Then there is great support by the sexy and likable Catherine Keener. Paul Rudd also adds humorous support as one of Andy's friends.As you'd expect there are plenty of low brow gags as well as some great one-liners and overall this is a charming and funny film, while Carell will certainly be one to watch for next year, and may star in his own sequel to Jim Carrey's Bruce Almighty which Carell was a co-star. ****",8,3,6,27 December 2005
Face_Off," The first American Woo film not to insult the genius of the man!
","John Woo's best film in Hollywood and probably will sadly never be surpassed. He has been wasted post Hong Kong but this was a genuinely class action movie. The plot itself is about as logical as flushing the toilet and then crapping, but the convoluted story takes a back seat to interesting character development. Its Sci-Fi elements don't take too much focus which is good, and unlike Woo to do so anyway. The film has John Travolta and Nic Cage both playing opposite characters, Travolta playing a more refined and less showy role than usual and Cage playing his usual extravagant role, then the two roles are traded as their characters get their faces swapped. There is an interesting dynamic as both actors play both to their usual types (very theatrical) and against type (more refined). Not to mention the psychological elements of the character with both having to wear the face of their Nemesis who they despise. It is particularly interesting from Archers point of view because he begins to hate himself and almost can't take what is happening to him. Of course as you expect with Woo the action is first rate, albeit with mucho doubling for Cage and Travolta. What is amazing now though is that face transplants are possible, so who knows perhaps one day soon we could take on someones whole identity. ****1/2",9,1,2,23 July 2004
Spider-Man," The best comic-to-film ever!!!
","Spiderman has come to the big screen after decades of wait. We've had Spidy appear in comics, cartoons and some more low profile movies but his exploits have never lit up the big screen, until now.This movie had to produce the goods, not just for Spiderman fans but for movie goers in general. It successfully brings to life one of the most popular comic characters ever and is definitely the best film of this year and in my opinion the best comic to film movie ever made, even better than Batman. What makes this better than most other effects movies is that it combines special effects wizardry with a good movie itself, what I mean is if you look at Star wars episode 2, take away the amazing effects and the movie is trash. Spiderman like Lord of the Rings is a great movie. It combines a good plot and interesting characters, and also has great performances. The film is very much like a comic book brought to life, it doesn't take itself to seriously and in Peter Parker we have a relatable hero who is likeable and suitably vulnerable. Unlike your typical action film with Schwarzenegger et al,  we have a human, 3 dimensional character.The cast are all good and are a large factor in the success of the film. Toby McGuires casting as Peter Parker/Spidy had quite a debate amongst Spiderman fanatics as to whether he was the right man for the job. I, and most fans will agree his casting was perfection. McGuire holds the screen and plays the part superbly. The character is also, like the comic, complex. Spiderman's actions have consequences even when he is doing good. He has conflicting emotions and as his uncle Ben says `with great power comes great responsibility'. It is an interesting part of the film, Spiderman can't do anything without different repercussions, just as in real life. For example, Peter Parker enters a wrestling competition and wins (beating none other than the Macho Man Randy Savage) he expects to win $3000 but is only given $100. When the organiser is robbed, Parker has a chance to stop the criminal but lets him go to get back at the organiser. Later that same criminal car jacks Peters uncle and shoots him in the process, killing him. Its scenes like this that add depth to the character and make you get behind him, and there are more examples particularly towards the end. Also very good in the film, in a similarly likeable character is the lovely Kirsten Dunst playing Mary Jane. She is excellent, she's charming, sweet and very pretty. Basically Dunst is playing the character to perfection. Mary Jane, like Peter, is faithfully recreated. Willem Defoe stars as the Green Goblin and his alter ego, scientist and entrepreneur, Norman Osborn. He is suitably menacing in the guise of the Green Goblin and plays the troubled Osborn equally as well. James Franco is also good as Osborn's son and friend of Peter. The action scenes are very good. With some great effects. Spiderman swings through the city and the camera swoops along with him to a vertigo inducingly brilliant affect. Sam Raimi's free flowing camera adds the perfect style to this film and he seems to have been made to direct the film. It's always exciting and importantly is well paced.Like most films that are effects based there is the odd moment where the effects look a bit off but that rarely happens and doesn't spoil the film.The movie is great, combining elements that make a great popcorn movie and elements that make a great film. It has a great cast, great action, a good story and a brilliant score from Danny Elfman. The film seems at times seems like a cross between Darkman and Batman, combining what made them great and adding to that. Overall it is the best film I've seen since Lord of the Rings and gets a well deserved 9/10",9,0,0,29 June 2002
Collateral," Cruise control!!
","Michael Mann returns to the crime thriller for the first time since Heat and it's the genre that has garnered most of his fan base. I personally think he is a master at this genre as proved with Heat, Manhunter and Thief. This is a tense and superbly unique piece of work. Unique in the fact that it's shot on digital at night with no real conventional lighting in most of the film. In this respect the film has an original and highly atmospheric look. The night time setting of LA is at once both cold and warm and the subdued colour gives the film a really interesting tone. The plot centres around a cabbie named Max who picks up a passenger named Vincent. Vincent then in effect hijacks Max and his cab and has him take him around LA to wipe out federal witnesses. It's a simplistic premise and the film like Mann's other crime thrillers are fascinating character studies. The characters of both Max and Vincent are the core of the movie and the relationship between them. As you would expect this acting is top notch. Tom Cruise is brilliant, truly worthy of an Oscar nod. It's a brave role that manages to let Cruise shift the Cruise mantle he has upon him. Many of his roles, despite his excellent efforts still do feel like it is Tom Cruise there, but here he shakes his star status off and is completely immersed in an adverse character. It's so far form his image and he inhabits the role so brilliantly that we see him as the character and not as Cruise playing a character. There is no whiff of this being a star vehicle that at times tarnished an other wise exemplary performance in Last Samurai. Also Jamie Foxx is also excellent. He is an up and comer of real promise and already being talked up for an Oscar nod for his performance in Ray. Also offering good support is the gorgeous Jada Pinkett Smith.Mann as usual seems to effortlessly create style and tension and excite. His uber realistic approach really gives the film an edge with it's action. Cruise as the hit-man is every inch like a highly trained assassin. Authenticity is something that is always in evidence in Mann's work and it is clearly evident here. This is a brilliant piece of work. It's exciting, highly atmospheric and despite a far from original premise, feels unique. I hope that in a slow year for Oscar fodder, that this film will get appreciation for Cruise and Mann in particular. This is one of the best films this year. *****",9,1,2,1 November 2004
Dark City," A classic sci-fi thriller, brilliant!!
","This is such a great film. The matrix with a hint of blade runner and a touch of the crow, this film is a visual tour-de-force! The plot is highly imaginative. It is a difficult film to explain, its one you must see yourself, but basically it centres on a man, played by Rufus Sewell, who wakes up in a bath tub with no memory of who he is, he also finds a dead body and then finds he is the lead suspect for a series of brutal murders. The city he is in has strange features to it, at  midnight every single inhabitant is in a state of comatose, and he soon finds that the city is actually an experiment into the human soul, run by strange looking aliens who look like the legend himself Pinhead. The film has plenty of great twists and is always developing right towards a fantastic finish. The acting is top notch by all concerned including Sewell in the lead, William Hurt as a police officer, Richard O Brien and the beautiful Jennifer Connelly. She was in fact the reason I bought the film on DVD, I have always fancied her since I was younger after Labyrinth. Anyway she is good in this despite being voice-overed for some singing scenes. Overall the film is brilliant but its not the acting, or the impressive story that stand out but the amazing effects and stunning visuals. The director Alex Proyas, who did the superb Crow, directs this film brilliantly. His visual style is dark and eerie and his film really unsettles. I was engrossed throughout becuase of the immersive atmosphere built up. Also for a low budget movie, the film had some of the most jaw dropping special effects I have ever seen, I would not have imagined how you could have done these sort of visuals outside of cartoons. The special effects, such as growing buildings, will truely leave you flabbergasted. 10/10 this must goe down as a visual, sci-fi classic like Blade runner. Also not only did the Matrix use some sets from this film but the Wacowski brothers must have got the odd piece of inspiration from this film.",10,1,3,6 April 2002
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Film of the year! Best Potter film by a country mile!!!
","With the latest installment, the producers have taken an extra year to produce it and made the inspired decision to put their faith in Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron. It was a brave decision however because although his last film Y Tu Mama Tambien was critically acclaimed, it was as far away from a kids fantasy film as you could get, in fact as some people described it, it was a Mexican porn movie. Now don't get me wronged I enjoyed the first two movies but despite all the money and special effects and sets, it did feel too conventional. Chris Columbus did a good job of introducing the Harry Potter universe but he did it simple. The film looked good but much like the Star Wars prequels it didn't get the blood pumping like a film with that scale has the potential too. The third installment really did work as a great movie going experience, I had sweaty palms by the half way stage and got really engrossed, what a great fantasy film should do.So what has Cuaron done differently then? Well like everyone has said in very simple terms, he has made it much darker. He has also done away with following a set formula. There are no house cup prizes at the end for Griffendore to celebrate. There is a brief Quidditch match but this is given extra dynamic by being set in stormy, thundery, lashing rain with the evil creature the Dementors getting involved. The first two Potter movies almost ran on a similar timeline, in fact when I look back and try and remember parts I do get confused about some parts, whether they were in the first or the second movie. Cuaron's grittier, edgier take on Potter makes it far more exciting not to mention a more exciting storyline to begin with.Harry Potter himself is growing up. He is far more self confident now and will not put up with the Dursley's tormenting. The Dursley's also seem aware and wary or Harry's powers. Harry becomes rebellious and strikes out at his abusive Aunt Marge played by Pam Ferris. When Harry runs away he is then picked up by a triple-decker bus that runs a special service for Wizards who have run away. He is taken to the minister of magic and it seem he may be in a whole heap of trouble because young Wizards cannot use magic outside of Hogwarts. He is merely given a warning but as it turns out there are more urgent matters for the Wizard and Witch community to worry about, the fact that an apparent cohort of Voldemort has escaped form Azkhaban prison. This person is Sirius Black played by Gary Oldman. Harry soon discovers that Black wad shopped his parents to Voldermort leading to his parents untimely deaths. Black's motives for escaping seem to be thus: He will finish the job that Voldermort didn't, kill Harry. Harry though doesn't wish to avoid Black because he becomes bent on revenge. He also has to contend with the guards of Azkhaban prison the dementors. a creation by Rowling and the Wizards at ILM. They really a great dynamic to the film and add some chills. The plot moves a long at a nice place and importantly the last hour is really exciting. Towards the end it is reminiscent of Back To The Future 2 and despite time travel paradoxes I really enjoyed that element.Another important improvement in this was the primary cast. The three young actors played by Harry Potter, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. The have really improved, especially Daniel Radcliffe who as Harry has the most responsibility towards the film to do well. He was a little flat in the first two movies which is no disrespect to him because child actors are rarely 100% natural, we have just grown to expect a lot more form young kids after superb little thesps like Haley Joel Osment (AI, Sixth Sense) and Keisha Castle-Hughes (Whale Rider). Radcliffe is good here and holds the movie well, and more impressively is that his role is more challenging than it has been before. Emma Watson is very good, she looks like having the most potential, she is already a good actress and looks like she'll be a stunner when she's older. Grint is also good and does more than mug. An important element is that the film now gives more time to the three central actors because they now have increased their ability to hold the movie without having to fall back on the adult cast. As such the roles for the teaching staff are reduced but as ever Alan Rickman is brilliant as Snape, he has made that role his own. Then you have the usual great support from Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith, Richard Griffith et al. Also there are new appearances by Emma Thompson, and also Michael Gambon as the new Dumbledore. Gambon is good giving a different interpretation of Dumbledore although I kind of liked Harris and his more whispery and regal Dumbledore, but a lot of his quietness and frailty was because he was not at all well during the production of both previous films. Gambon will make a very good replacement though. The two new faces that really stood out for me were firstly Gary Oldman. He was excellent as Black. He essentially only appears in person near the end but as soon as he does Oldman decides that he will steal the thunder of all around him, no mean feat considering he shares a scene with both Rickman and David Thewlis. It is great to see Oldman back on the big screen. He is not playing a conventional bad guy, and you'll know what I mean when you see what transpires, but he is as ever superb. For me though the star role was David Thewlis as professor Lupin. Lupin was a former friend of Harry's parents and as such forms a bond with Harry and also teaches him how to defend himself against the Dementors. Thewlis is excellent, his character will be sorely missed as I don't believe he will re-appear in future films. It is a shame because in each of the sequels there have been characters who have been superbly played by the cream of British talent. Chamber of Secrets featured a scene stealing Kenneth Brannagh. This installment did have the best cast list and cameo list. Dawn French makes an amusing appearance (the day she is not amusing will not come soon) as does her husband Lenny Henry and also a re-appearance, albeit very brief for Julie Walters and Mark Williams as Ron's parents.Cuaron does a great job. The camera is almost always in motion. This works very well with effects shots in the same way Peter Jackson used a lot of CGI shots in the Rings trilogy. By having the camera in motion while a CGI beast is there for example it means it gives less focus on the creature and as such will make it look more real. Cuaron also has some great and unsettling crane shots. Remember the super cool shots in David Fincher's Panic Room when the character moves down from floor to floor and carry's through into the kitchen, through a coffee pot and up to a key hole, with the aid of a computer of cause. These computer assisted crane shots look cool and there a few in this film. Not only is his use of the camera excellent but on a visual basis from the set to the cinematography the film makes far better use of its setting. It looks really great. The film is given a cold look. When it's not raining, it's dark and dingy and muggy or everything is covered in snow. The film looks superb, it makes good visuals from the last movie look better tenfold. Cuaron will certainly be sorely missed and there does seem like there will be an air of pessimism surrounding Mike Newell's appointment for next years Goblet of Fire. Now looking at Newell's track record there is little to suggest he will be a great choice to do a fantasy of this scale but having said that Cuaron raised eyebrows last year in much the same way. It is sadly a fact that a lot of British directors are very conventional and lack flair these days. I hope Newell will take a leaf from Cuaron's style book and surprise everyone, much like Cuaron himself has.Overall this is the best and most enjoyable film I have seen this year and in a year of letdowns as far as the big blockbusters and epics. Kill Bill 2 has been the only film thus far of high anticipation not to be a letdown like overblown epics Last Samurai, Troy and Passion Of Christ has been. This was effective and affecting stuff. ****1/2",9,0,0,5 June 2004
Spirited Away," Best animated film I have seen!
","This is a wonderfully imaginative and fantastical children's fantasy. It is easy to see why it was perhaps the critical hit of 2002. The film is glorious to look at. It is a testament to old fashioned animation techniques that seem to be resigned to foreign animations. Of course there is some use of computer imagery for certain shots but they blend seamlessly and the overall artistry involved is superlative.This is the first Hayao Miyazaki film I have seen and I will certainly watch his others. The story plays on many elements successful with kids films, that transport you back to your own childhood and also allows the young audience to connect with the themes in the movie too. The story centres around Chihiro, a young girl about to move into a new place and who feels insecure about the new environment she will be living in. These fears become a part of her encounter with a strange abandoned amusement park that she and her parents find when they reach a dead end in their car. At the park they find that their is a stall that is seemingly open, with glorious displays of mouth watering food. There are no people about but Chihiros parents decide to gorge themselves on this bounty and pay later. As Chihioro explores she comes across a strange boy who warns her to get out before dark. It is too late however, because as night falls, ghosts are awakened, and then by the time she gets back to her parents they are turned into pigs. She then finds that the route she came from is gone and she is now trapped in this place, her only allie being the boy she met earlier. She is told to get a job at the centre piece of the park, a bath house run by Yubaba, an evil power mad witch. This is a bath house for the spirits and Chihiro has to find a job there before she is found and turned into an animal herself, then unable to save her parents.The story is imaginative and the characters and animations endlessly unique and strange. This is just so much more creative than Hollywood. The characters are likeable and we become engrossed with Chihiros adventures inside this bathhouse, and the characters she comes into contact with as she tries to get her parents back as humans and whilst trying to get back to the human world. What I also loved in this film is that the animation gives it a real sense of cinematography, the drawing makes the film stand out in a way that American animations rarely do. Another film I think of that looked really good was Bellville Rendezvous. Another great point in fact the best part of it, is the fantastic score. It really is uplifting and very original. This is just great film making. *****",10,214,291,2 April 2004
The Usual Suspects," The greatast mystery thriller ever made!
","The Usual Suspects is a low budget master piece. With a cast of actors that screams class, and one of the most superbly written scripts, this film delivers the goods it should. Bryan Singer directs, and it is obvious this guy had a vision, he carries out the film with flairy class and creates a tense and gripping movie that come the end will leave you with your tongue hanging out in gormless dis-belief with a longing to watch the movie over and over again. The film starts out with the five central characters participating against their will in a line up, they are all criminals but are arrested seemingly on a trump charge and they need to figure out why, together in a cell they plot to do a job together, and not a job you could call in any way legal. This is in fact all being told by Kevin Spacey's character Verbal, the films actual setting is in a police detectives office as he is questionning Verbal about a slaughter on a boat where over 30 people were killed. The film is mainly told in flashbacks about the events leading up to Verbals interrogation. From the moment their first job is done things gradually build in pace and the air of mystery sets in. Kobayashi is a mysterious man played by Pete Postlethwaite, who claims he works for a guy called Kayzer Soze, a man who may or may not be a myth but who sends shivers down the spines of those who hear his name, rumours are even that this guy may be the devil himself, it turns out that all the five guys in someway owe mr Soze and are required to rob the boat of a large shipment of drugs, nobody knows who soze is but they are scared of him. The film is pure genius, full of twists and turns of which you could only guess by taking a wild stab in the dark. The music is atmospheric, and the way the film spans out is excellent, the director gives you plenty of clues as to the identity of Kayzer Soze and the film has so much depth to it and so many levels. The fact is you never quite know if verbal is telling the truth, we hear the happenings from his point of view but he may be exagerrating or bending the truth, its only the very end when things become clear. All the actors are great, Spacey was worthy of his oscar, and he really impresses here, also Gabriel Byrne is on top form too. Also I must say i'm not a big fan of Steven Baldwin, I've never been too impressed with his films especially the incredibly lame sequal to the Flintstones which in itself was lame, but in this Baldwin is very good as Macmanus the slightly nutty, gun happy criminal. Also Benicio Del Torro and Kevin Pollock have some good roles and most of the humour comes from them. This film is a must see, it has one of the greatest movie plot twists ever. 10/10",Null,0,1,12 May 2002
Batman Begins," Batman is finally here!
","The caped crusader returns to the big screen and he seems to be suggesting to us that he is making his debut and that a certain quartet of movies from yesteryear never happened. Batman Begins is basically re-writing Batman for the cinema audience, but in particular to the fans of Bob Kanes original vision and the graphic novels of Frank Millar. This Batman film is dark. It is a Batman film, with no camp and it's about IL' Bruce and his alter ego and not so heavily focused on the villains. Burtons 89 version of Batman was a good movie, good fun and as much as Jack Nicholson is the man and a certified god, the film didn't have the brooding edge of Batman. Sure there was darkness, but Burtons trademark quirky dark, not dank, pessimistic and just a little brutal like Begins. Christopher Nolan has continually said he was going to base Batman in reality and he does that. He makes everything feel conceivable and gives good insight into how Bruce takes on his alter ego. We know the plot, Bruce sees his parents get killed then ends up as a crime fighter, but Nolan fills in the gaps that Burton et al never really did. This film has a really dark tone and a philosophical undertone to it and marks the first intelligent Batman film. It feels Gothic and feels like The Crow, a similarly dark and twisted tale. Many who watched the Crow feeling 2that is how Batman should have been!' Now we get that! Thank you Chris Nolan.This film has a good plot and we have the usual comic book threat to local civilisation, while there are plenty of good twists and turns, but it is the character arc of Bruce and his interactions that are particularly engaging. This film has an epic feeling from the way it is shot to the score but also by the incredible cast of people who all come in a put their stamp on their roles whether small or more significant. Firstly Christian Bale as Batman. He is the ultimate Batman now. Firstly the role is well written and grounded but Bale pulls it off superbly. It's a performance of intensity and that thankfully challenges the actor. Yes Keaton was a good Batman, but it wasn't a performance that tested him dramatically. Bruce Wayne is a three dimensional person here. Bale is not only in excellent shape for this role but he manages to capture the heroicness of Batman as well as the tortured psyche of Wayne. Michael Caine is also excellent as Alfred. He brings real heart to the movie. He is one of the characters that lightens the film when necessary and acts as a side of optimism around Wayne. Caine really excels here with charm. Similarly Gary Oldman is another heart of the movie. Oldman isn't given much to do off the page I shouldn't think but the nuances he brings to his performance are pure class and he makes sure that Chief Gordon really stands out and for the first time in any Batman movie you'll remember who played Gordon. Morgan Freeman also appears in a small but memorable role. Also credit for Liam Neeson who seems to be in demand at the moment, and he, like Oldman and Caine, shares the best scenes with Bale. Neeson is particularly prominent in the opening 40 minutes and his interaction with Bale is fascinating. Elsewhere there are roles for Tom Wilkinson and also Rutger Hauer and they provide yet more class in roles that could have gone to jobbing actors but Nolan's insistence in loading his roles with real A-class actors pays off superbly, similar to Sin City (which also had an appearance from Hauer!). With the film so male dominated Katie Holmes is good eye candy relief and does her role very well, despite being given little to do.Nolan has really crafted a fantastic looking movie. It grabs you instantly and just looks fantastic. The washed out colours and the use of shadow is superb and gives the film an unnerving and cold atmosphere. Nolan shows himself to be adept at a big budget movie and also does well with the action scenes which include a jaw dropping car chase. The action isn't over stylised and there's no sign of bullet time you'll be pleased to hear but it plays on confusion as Batman strikes. He comes from the shadows, pouncing on his victims, taking them by surprise like a horror film stalker. While Nolan is excellent he has also got together both Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard for the score which once again is excellent. Iti s understated, atmospheric and just a little ominous. There seems to be a deep growling drone hanging through much of the film, creating a sense of heightened tension. Howard's parts (the non-action moments) are particularly good. You think of the kind of creepiness to scores in The Shining or Cronenberg films and they are similar to much of the tone of this.Batman Begins is the number one comic book movie and now the definitive Batman film. *****",10,1,2,17 June 2005
The Princess Bride," What a film!!!!!!!
","I loved this  film as a kid and still do!, i won't make this long because all the other reviews have pointed out many of the good points. This is a classic and a rare kid film that is actually through the entire length watchable to adults, everything about this film is good, its a feel good film its entertaining it has an absolutely brilliant sword fight between Montaya and Westley, in fact one of the best i have ever seen, Cary elwes exudes charisma while Robin Wright exudes beauty while all the support are equally superb with the likes of Mel smith and Billy Crystal making very funny cameos. Superb, Great, Brilliant, excellent and quite frankly there aren't enough words in the dictionary i can use to praise this film.",9,1,2,23 December 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Gorgeous film!
","This is just a gorgeous film. Ang Lee directs this epic chinese fantasy with real class, the film is amazing. The look, the sound, the story and characters, the music, the set design, especially the choreography of the fights is amazing. There is a real beauty to each and every frame of every scene thanks to the combination of Peter Pau's cinematography and Ang Lee's direction. The cast is also excellent, Michelle Yeoh is great and Chow Yun Fat is just Chow Yun Fat simple as that. It is Zang Zhyi who steals the show however, she just radiates the screen with her soulful eyes and natural beauty, how anyone can look so gorgeous without a hint of make-up is beyond me, she looks one of the most naturally beautiful women ever, she can also act and fight. Michelle Yeoh ain't too bad either. However if any hetero man is not captivated by Zang Zhiyi then he must be visually impaired. *****",10,0,0,23 July 2004
Hellboy," Great comic book movie, Ron Perlman is the man!!
","The latest comic book to be transferred on to the big screen is Mike Mignola's cult series, Hellboy. Hellboy is the son of Satan who found his way to earth in 1944, when Nazi's by the order of Adolf, decided they would try and win the war by opening the gateway to hell. Hellboy slipped through and was taken into care by the Allied army's paranormal specialist played by John Hurt. With the Nazi's having been foiled in a brilliant opening scene set in wartime Scotland, we flash forward to present times and Hellboy is now a fully grown beast working for the FBI in a special unit that battles all manner of devilish demons. Hellboy is the main government assassin against these freaks of nature. Alongside him is his father (Hurt) and mer-man Abe Sapien, a strange creature who can read minds and see into the past and future. There is also Hellboys love interest played by Selma Blair, who has the distinct gift of bursting into flames whenever she gets angry or upset (thank god all women don't do that otherwise that time of the month would be hell). The films source material is much like that of the Crow, and the Blade series. It is real cult material and few will have an assumed knowledge of it and the few that do will probably know it inside and out. It is probably the sort of comic that doesn't have casual readers like many of Marvels favourite heroes. It is far darker material. Despite a dark theme and dark material this film isn't excessively dark like the Crow was and Blade. They have done it out so that visually it is fantastic and dark but this was only a pg-13 in America and a 12A in the UK and as such it isn't massively violent and they have lightened the tone a fair bit with plenty of humour. In some ways I would have enjoyed more grit and edge, an R rated version but it still works very well. What helps here is that director Guillermo Del Toro is probably the biggest Hellboy geek on the planet by his own admission and his passion ensures that fans will be satisfied. I don't know how faithful it is personally but I have seen artwork and visually the have got Hellboy spot on. By all accounts though, the geek-boys loved it. Del Toro is a great visual director as he proved in Cronos and also Blade 2 but this film looks amazing. From dark and grimy rain soaked locales, to snow covered, to a fiery hot, burning post apocalyptic vision of the future. All the sets are great as are the effects. Del Torro is no stranger to cult movies as I mentioned before with Cronos and the second Blade film and in each of those films and this too, there is a recurring element, Ron Perlman. He's a master of cult movies having worked with Del Torro several times and also appearing in cult French fantasy City Of The Lost Children. Perlman is one of those recognisable faces you see in a lot of movies and it's a shame is not more well known. He has a strange cult following who like the guy. Perlman is certainly capable as an action man, he has the build and is very tall but what has held him back is his looks. He doesn't look like hero material, he's not particularly photogenic and that is proved by the very fact that his full 4 hour Hellboy make up is actually a marked improvement. The part that is tragic is that he is a good character actor, he has charisma and is cool. I think that Hellboy gives him a potential long series of films to turn him into a star and make him more popular but the fact of the matter is, he will never sell a movie by his name. He has gone from big budget Hellboy and his next movie is a $2 million, more than likely DTV, action film. Hellboy wasn't a massive box office hit, due to it being very cult material and having no star name, but it was a critical success and has done well on the video shelves so hopefully a sequel will come, by all sources involved it seems possible, and the appeal can only increase for another film. Let's face who imagined it would be a really good movie, not many. I would have been satisfied if it had matched the Blade films but it beats them. Perlman is superb in this film, he rocks. He has come form nowhere really to the majority of the general movie going public and has been a revelation, it is his most high profile role and film. John Hurt is also good in a brief role and also Selma Blair is good too.The action kicks bum. Del Torro crafts some wonderful set pieces and the film has good effects, particularly for a film with a fairly modest budget for a summer action movie. The whole look of the film is striking and there is a great attention to detail. Marco Beltrami also provides a marvelous score. The only minor quibbles are that certain elements are not fully explained. How the Nazi characters don't age for example and also the backgrounds to some of the supporting characters. For a summer movie that has such a brisk pace the plot-holes don't affect it too much. Overall this is a very good and entertaining summer movie with some character. Perlman is superb and Del Torro's stubbornness in holding out for Perlman and agreeing with the studio to drop the budget to have him in, was inspired. It was certainly a risk but you cannot put a price on good casting. The studio wanted the then, flavour of the month Vin Diesel and although I like him he would not have nailed the role as perfectly as Ron Perlman. ****",8,1,2,16 September 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Film of 2002!!!
","Is this better than Fellowship? Well, I'm undecided. This has improvements and in turn it has elements that are lost from the first one. I'm not talking in terms of quality, in production, acting, directing etc, but this is the middle of the story. While this introduces new characters and had the complication and more large scale battles, I really liked the exposition of the first film, with its sense of mystery building up, I was also a big fan of Borimir, he was a great character and his brother, who appears in this film is not quite as interesting.Some of the improvements are as followed. Aragons role in the film is more central. In this film he is in it start to finish whereas he didn't enter the first movie until an hour in. I think Viggo's expanded role will give him a very good shot for an Oscar nomination as best supporting actor. He didn't quite have enough screen time in Fellowship to warrant that but he certainly put an Oscar worthy performance in. The rest of the cast are on fine form and I think I really have to re-iterate everything I said about the first film. This is pure magic and film making excellence, the production design is fantastic, the whole look of the film from its sets to the visual effects really transport you to middle earth for three hours and keep you transfixed. The real, real star of this movie and really what really breaks the mould in terms of movie magic, which wasn't yet broken by the first installment, is the most frighteningly realistic CGI character ever. Gollum is freakily realistic, and the vocal performance from Andy Serkis is Oscar worthy. You really feel as if he is a real living person, the animation is superb, awe-inspiring.As I mentioned all the cast are great, the new additions such as Bernard Hill and in particular Brad Dourif as Worm Tongue are excellent. Basically, like Fellowship, you won't find a better mixture of top draw action, music, acting, cinematography, direction, production design, visual effects in any movie period. No other films can compete in terms of having grade A class in every department. This gets a well deserved 10 out of 10.",Null,0,0,11 January 2003
The Incredibles," Incredible!
","When you think of track records by companies that are entirely first class in the movie business, you'll be stumped but then consider Pixar. These are the guys behind Toy Story 1 and 2, A Bugs Life, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo and now The Incredibles. That is a fantastic CV with nothing below very good. The weakest of the Pixar movies is A Bugs Life but that's only because it had its thunder stolen by Antz. Once again Pixar deliver a superb, exciting, funny, and all round entertaining family film. If anything this is their most adult because the first 40 minutes deals with Mr Incredibles suffering at his boring life, since he was fired as a superhero. The family of superheroes have to hide their powers and it plagues them. There is a surprising amount of everyday life, drama here and this was a brave move for a film primarily made to cater for youngsters. It has a similar thematic depth to it as another Superhero film by the name of Spiderman. They allow these characters to be real people in an extraordinary situation not just making it a simple and hollow superhero flick, all about their powers.The story follows Mr Incredible and his family. For some time they have been living as ordinary citizens after Mr Incredible rescued someone who was trying to commit suicide and the guy sues him. This starts a spate of liable cases against superheroes (a thinly veiled jab at Americas sue happy culture.) and they are forced to live like normal people. This is all very well and good but Incredible yearns to be a hero again rather than a pen pusher. He and his friend Frozone go out on nightly rogue missions to help people getting into trouble along the way. The story soon has the Incredibles back donning their suits to fight a new foe, called Syndrome, also known as Buddy Pine who was once Incredibles biggest fan. They must fight giant robots on secret islands and in Manhattan as well. Rest assured the film is funny and has great action but more than that it is a change of pace for Pixar. This film is not as heavily comedic as their other films. There aren't a whole host of quirky and eccentric side characters. It's not a laugh a minute film because they have some family drama in it and it plays out more like and action movie. It never resorts to spoofing the Hero genre too much which I felt it would probably do. The film is entirely light hearted but it isn't scattered with jokes throughout. Some people may like this change while some may prefer to have more humour but in any case the film is funny enough.Once again the film has the lush looking visuals and pushes the envelope even more than the last film but it works to its degree thanks to the excellent voice work. That has always been a Pixar strength, the fantastic vocal performances. You see some films where the vocal performance doesn't work, particularly in some recent Disney movies like Sinbad. Craig T Nelson is excellent as Mr Incredible and plays it very well, he makes the part his own and you must respect the fact that Pixar didn't just go for the biggest names on the block. The same is true of Jason Lee as Syndrome. The big names come in the form of Holly Hunter, as Elastigirl and Samuel L Jackson as Frozone. In one respect I can compare this excellent casting to Albert Brooks in Finding Nemo, Brooks not one of the biggest stars but he had the lead and did it well, with TV icon Ellen Degeneres superb at his side. These films could easily resort to brining in the Clooney's, Pitts, Farrell's, Blooms and giving them lead parts, without them really being suited to the parts, but they cast the best person for the job. Sure their first film might be accused of doing that by casting Tom Hanks in the lead, but he was perfect for the part of Woody.This is another example of good storytelling combined with cracking visuals and its fun for all the family. It was risky increasing in the serious side and losing some comedy, because it could have alienated the kids, but the pacing is perfect and the youngsters never lost interest when I saw it, they were transfixed. As was I! *****",10,1,2,7 January 2005
Driven," Stallones fall continues!
","Stallones last couple of offerings have been real flops. Firstly a remake of, hardly a classic, Get Carter, that was followed by this little number, Driven. While both films were not all that bad, they did not merit the amount of money spent on them or the talent Sly possesses, and like his former rival Ah-nuld, often wastes. Of course Sly is by far the better actor but we all know that a lot of Arnie flicks could and should have been better. Of Stallones two recent fares, Get Carter is probably the better film but Driven is far more enjoyable to watch than the overly dark and at times dull remake of the cult hit with Mickey Caine in the 70's. 	Anyway, Driven is basically half music video and half soap opera with the odd break for an exciting race sequence. The direction in the film is a little shoddy at times and there are moments that ooze with pure cheese of the stinkiest variety. Slys script is pretty poor it has elements he has written before and to explain to you what I mean just think Rocky 5 on wheels without the twist of Rocky's student betraying Rocky. What Stallones script does do well is the amount of characters given good roles, with depth. This film is definitely a character based film but poor dialogue and lame direction outside of the race scenes make you feel as if your watching an episode of neighbours. The bad points of the script? Well these are the plot and the dialogue. The plot is wafer thin and old and the dialogue is so tacky at times, admittedly some of it is good though but only the odd inspired moment.	Although the film features a lacklustre screenplay and cheesy direction I have to say that the acting is top notch. Sly in particular is in good form, he has definitely given himself a role with some challenge. The others are good too, Til Schweiger as the German race driver who is the main rival to young hotshot Jimmy Bly played well by Kip Pardue. Also on her studio debut the gorgeous Estella Warren does a credible job. Burt Reynolds ranges from the top of his game to slighting hamming but he has some of the better scenes including  a good one with Sly. 	The selling point of the film, which didn't sell it very well, are the exceptional racing sequences which make a boring sport seem extremely exciting. The special effects are some of the best around, with exceptional crashes such as a car flying through the air in bullet time as other racers fly by underneath. While some effects are dazzling some seem to lack effort such as a digital coin and sewer lid. While these scenes don't quite save the rest of the film they do build up the excitement levels at just the right time so you never become too bored watching the uninteresting relationships and double dealings. Overall this film has its plus points but they are outweighed by negatives. Renny Harlin has proven himself as a great action director but a drama like this and he looks lost outside of the race sequences. Sly had better do something better than this and fast if he is to resurrect his career. 5/10",5,0,0,11 April 2002
School of Rock," Rock is not dead!!! Thanks JB!
","One of the surprise movies of last year in the States, finally makes its way to British shores and I have to say that the praise heaped upon it, and particularly Jack Black is more than warranted. The film is the sort of `loser learning the error of his ways and becoming a winner' type of movie we have seen many times before but not in a long time has a film with the predictable formula been as good. This film has been compared to Sister Act 2, because the subject matter is so similar. A musician poses as a teacher and teaches their class the joys of music and then takes their pupils to compete for a musical prize. While Sister Act 2 was attempting to be more meaningful and speaking more about society (while not particularly succeeding), School Of Rock is more pure entertainment and more exuberant. It in many ways inverts what Sister Act 2 did. While Whoopi Goldbergs character attempts to bring her pupils together and on the straight and narrow by making them into a choir, Jack Black leads his kids astray with rock. School Of Rock it must be said is infinitely more entertaining.
The film follows rock enthusiast Dewey, a Bum who dreams of being as big as the likes of his idols Led Zeppelin and AC/DC. He falls out with his band because he embarrasses them by taking things too far and generally not being as good as he thinks he his. When his former band are preparing to enter a battle of the bands, Dewey is attempting to form a new band because his ultimate goal is to win this battle of the bands. At the same time his flatmates girlfriend is annoyed that Dewey never pays Ned (his flatmate) any respect and owes him over 2000 dollars in back rent. Dewey now needs some cash and so needs a job. When the principal of a posh private school (Joan Cusack) calls for Ned (a temp teacher) to replace an injured teacher, Dewey pretends to be Ned and takes the job as an easy two weeks to make a lot of money. Dewey has no intention of doing any work with the pupils and is quite content to give them a two week recess. That is until he hears them in their music class and sees his opportunity to mould them into his own rock band and enter them in this battle of the bands under the pre-text that they are in a school competition. Anyway the plot is simple enough and while we know what will happen you just have to sit back and love the film.Jack Black is a one man army here. The film entertains at the level it does for two key reasons: Jack Black and the brilliant soundtrack. Jack Black is superb. His exuberant, screeching, gyrating and facially contorting performance is non-stop entertainment. He is superb. I'm a fan of Jack Black, he is always great value and a scene stealer in his supporting parts but as yet I wasn't convinced he could lead a film. Shallow Hal he was funny but wasn't as rampart through 90 minutes and add to that a disappointing showing from the Farrelly Brothers. Here however Black takes his big step to comedy A-list. While the likes of Eddie Murphy and Steve Martin seem to be dying painfully unfunny deaths in tripe, the likes of Black, Will Ferrell, Ben Stiller, and Owen Wilson are on the rise. Ample replacements for some legends indeed. The rest of the cast are good. The kids can act and to give the film even more charm they can actually play their instruments and sing. Also Joan Cusack is always good and once again she shines too. Finally I'll mention the soundtrack again. There wasn't a single song I didn't like. You have classic rock tunes from AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Eric Clapton and more. There are also some great original songs too including the centre piece song School Of Rock. Jack Black also writes several of the songs and also sings on them. The best way to describe this film would be: It Rocks!! ****",9,0,0,20 March 2004
The Game," the best film i've seen this year.
","I only just watched this film the other week after putting it off for ages, i never really got excited enough about it to sit down and watch a Michael Douglas film is,nt what i would put high on my list, not because i dislike him but i never really get drawn into his style of film if there is a thriller like this on one sky channel and an all guns blazing action film on the other then i'm likely to watch the action flick for the adrenaline rush. Now i wish i had watched this sooner and at the cinema. This is an absolutely brilliant film the writing of it is excellent, despite its far fetched idea and happenings (none of the events of the film could ever really happen the way it did in the film). The direction is also first rate and the atmosphere that is created is so tense and really creates a sense of paranoia, i unfortunately missed the first ten or so minutes but the Game as such had not really got started so i lucked out, i can't really explain why i found this film so intrigueing, its an edge of the seat affair that is brilliantly acted and strange because after the film i was trying to think what just went on and you want to see it again much like Finchers other film Fight club which is also excellent, but i do prefer this. I don't know quite why i was never bothered about watching this especailly considering how excellent it was and i must say to watch it at the cinema in the dark would be excellent i hope the do have a special re-showing of this like they do with some films. All in all not to be missed, and it requires two viewings unfortunately i haven't watched for the second time so i'll have to buy it, well done all involved in the making of this i say.",10,0,2,25 April 2001
Hero," A visionary masterpiece!
","Following the success and pure class of Crouching Tiger, there was a long wait for something as good to find its way over to the states, but now it has. Hero is an exceptional piece of film-making from director Yimou Zhang. The film is a lush and gorgeous piece of art that makes Crouching Tiger look like an ugly sibling, hidden away in the basement being chucked scraps of raw cow. Now this is quite something because Ang Lee's visionary epic was itself a very gorgeous film. Everything that Lee's film had going for it is right here with Zhang's film, from the gorgeous cinematography through to the wonderful production design, costumes, score and an engaging story full of philosophy, myth, religion and history. Which of the two films is better? Well it's a tough one to call. Both films have their strengths over the other but for me Crouching Tiger would narrowly pip this to the most because Hero's story becomes a little convoluted as it goes on. Also Crouching Tiger did have Chow Yun- Fat in it too.Hero stars the one and only Jet Li. Li is not known as a great thespian and it was essential that, being primarily a martial arts star, aside from the ass kickery, he had to hold his own against some great actors, such as Tony Lueng. Li's understated performance is excellent. It's a very stoic role but it requires a performance to come from within. It has to have the same power hat Bruce Lee gave in Enter The Dragon and Chuck Bronson did in Once Upon A Time In The West. Li pull's it off, it's a performance of real restraint and inner power and he looks a far cry from his wooden persona in Hollywood pap like Cradle 2 The Grave and The One. He is almost a narrator in the story and is the centre piece and Li was not the initial choice for the film. A more respected actor was wanted for the part, like Chow Yun-Fat, but Li thoroughly rules his role and makes this part his own. Tony Leung steals the movie though. Leung is fantastic a really great performance adding the gravitas that Chow did in Crouching Tiger. He is a great actor, right up there with Chow and deservedly was recognised in the HK film awards. Also starring is Maggie Cheung. Cheung is fantastic as well and unbelievably gorgeous. She made me want to break down and cry at the glorious creation of womanhood, and simultaneously go at it with myself in the cinema screen, but the threat of arrest was just about enough of a deterrent. You can sit and merely marvel at her gorgeousness with the sound turned down. Not far behind in the yummy stakes is Zhang Zhiyi who also starred in Crouching Tiger, she is also superb in this.The action in this film is brilliant including a fantastic martial arts fans' wet dream showdown between Jet Li and Donnie Yen. All the action scenes have a specific tone to follow and have certain colours affluent throughout the scene that will represent things like truth, courage and honour. The action looks amazing and beats that of Crouching Tiger in sheer imagination. At the same time this has a remarkably toned down Jet Li in the action, it's all very minimalist with his movements and doesn't utilize his fantastic kicking ability as much as other films have. The action shows Li as an ultimate fighter who does maximum damage with minimum effort. Also the action is far more weapon orientated than most of Li's other films. There are some great sequences here and understandably Quentin Tarantino was a big advocate for the film and whose determination almost solely got the film it's long awaited US release.This is arguably the film of the year and is a joy to behold. It's another lesson to Hollywood about doing an epic with subtlety and an action film with heart, and a drama with true power on a fraction of those inflated budgeted American star vehicles. Not to be missed. *****",10,1,2,1 November 2004
Pi," No budget masterpiece!
","Shot on a microscopic budget, this debut feature from Darren Arnofsky is an audacious, and superbly conceived sci-fi thriller. As is fairly obvious within it's history this is a genre that is particularly difficult to get right, with far more failures than successes. PI is a film that is intelligent, engaging, and shot for virtually nothing, while big bucks are often spent on poorly written drivel.Arnofsky's little masterpiece is filmed in black and white and the film is beautifully shot. The camera movements and the editing are very effective and really this film looks and feels fairly unique. Indeed the storyline itself is truly original and in this age of sequels, adaptations and remakes it's oft the case that we must trawl back through cinema of years gone by to find unique films we have yet to see. PI is delightfully such a case. Revolving around a loner, paranoid, maths genius called Max (Sean Gullette), the film portrays a character unlike what we have seen, yet believable. Inflicted with paranoia and hypochondria, Max lives in near total isolation, popping pills, avoiding the outside world where possible and constantly studying numbers, looking for patterns. As he begins to unravel certain numerical patterns, he finds himself the centre of previously non existent, attention. Max is psychologically unbalanced and the film follows him beyond breakdown, while he also tires to fend off his sudden popularity.Certainly this is a film that will provoke discussion and multiple theories, as the best of this genre should do. Still aside from an excellent script this features a pulsating score and soundtrack and also some excellent performances, particularly Gullette whose portrayal of Max is raw and at times brilliant. This is a film I took far too long to get round to seeing but I'm glad I did. ****",8,0,1,4 July 2006
Children of Men," Visionary! A remarkable technical achievement.
","This brilliant and understated sci-fi thriller, is a truly revolutionary movie. As a technical achievement this ranks as one of cinema's, important achievements. Technically yes, it's superb, but equally the film has meaning too, and challenges. The dystopic future sub-genre is one that often can be overdone, overblown and overwrought, but not so here. Under the guidance of most other directors doing this sort of film nowadays, this would have been laden with CGI, and without the meaning underneath the visual sheen. Here director Alfonso Cuaron puts the audience in a world that's believable and within possibility. This is not a future staring at oblivion to come in a flash, it's a future that has long been slowly crawling to the end of humanity.The human race has been slowly dying out for 18 years, since women have become infertile. Clive Owen plays a man watching in quiet, dismal contemplation at the hopelessness around him, until he's contacted by his ex-wife, played by Julianne Moore. She's part of a group called the human project, part rebel, part terrorist, who oppose the fascist government that is running, and ruining what's left of Britain. Refugees, immigrants are illegal, no longer welcome, and the rest of the world isn't in much better shape. Julian (Moore) wants Theo (Owen) to transport a girl down south, from London. The importance of this girl becomes paramount when it's revealed she's pregnant. The first pregnancy in 18 years. Different factions would no doubt want to use this to their own ends, and Owen takes it upon himself to take her to hope, or to the human fund. Of course there are many obstacles in the way. The premise is dark, and similarly frightening. Amongst it all, Cuaron ensures the dialogue, the actors feel natural.The film is of a genre done before, yet feels fresh, from the scripting, to the look of the film. Indeed Cuaron's earthy, un-showy look, using a dreary, almost dead colour palette and a lot of handled work, evoke a sense of reality. As does his tendency for lots of extended single shot takes. It would be interesting to count the amount of cuts in this film, but it would be a hell of a lot lower than the average Hollywood movie. Indeed this is a daring, and engrossing move from Cuaron. The extended takes, keep the audience right in the action, engaging, pulling you in. None more so than during the exhilarating action scenes with some of the most technically astounding sequences, all in one long take, one shot, and you can't help but be amazed. It's not some overly showy, hollow and cold CGI exhibition, it's down to meticulous planning, timing and execution. We've seen things such as Superman, Star Wars in the last couple of years thanks to the glory of CGI, but the action scenes in this are far more exciting and far superior in concept and execution. The simple fact that the actors are put in a situation whereby they must be in perfect sync with the stunt guys, the cameraman, and remember their cues, their positions etc, it's a miraculous technical and artistic achievement. The first action scene, as well as the finale (which is an insanely long single shot) are awe inspiring.The cast too are brilliant. Clive Owen continues to fly the flag for Britain, and make a good name for himself. Julianne Moore, Michael Caine, Chiwetal Ejiofor, and Pam Ferris are all superb in support, while the young Claire-Hope Ashitay is also impressive as Kee. All under the expert and visionary direction of Alfonso Cuaron, who surely is one of the next big names, and perhaps in the new wave of excellence in genre films, once taken up by the likes of Spielberg, Cameron, Scott. Children Of Men is surely a landmark in cinema, and will certainly gain in reputation as the years go by. This will be a revisionist film. *****",10,8,13,18 January 2007
Shrek 2," Computer Generated Hilarity!!
","Each year it seems we now expect our big animated extravaganza. Usually one a year but 2004 sees Shrek 2 and Shark Tale vying with the Incredibles from the master animation team Pixar. Outside of Pixar, DreamWorks is a company with a good track record. It certainly seems that many of these companies are accelerating beyond the old masters Disney, who up until recently had a piece of the Pixar pie without much creative credit or merit for hits like Toy Story and Finding Nemo. The Shreks are the best 3d animations outside of the Toy Story series and Finding Nemo, they are funny and decidedly more biting to pop culture with a lot of hysterical referential jokes.Shrek 2 is one of the best films this year. It lives up to the first film, and exceeds it in terms of animation, cameos, and jokes. Once again the three leads, Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz are excellent in their roles, with Murphy once again stealing the show and making us wonder why he can't be funny in his live action roles anymore. The list of supporting parts is huge. There is everyone's favourite hilltop singing, umbrella wielding Dame, Julie Andrews, who plays the Queen of Far Far Away, and what a Queen she'd make in real life. Then you have John Cleese as her husband the King who to my delight and many others has a few Basil Fawlty-esque moments. Also starring is Rupert Everett as Prince Charming and the always brilliant Jennifer Saunders, and what a shame her comedy partner Dawn French wasn't given a role, although she appeared to fun effect in Harry Potter 3 and will subsequently appear in The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe so we've had are Hollywood Dawn fix. The star of this piece though is Antonio Banderas who has garnered rave reviews for his portrayal of the ingenious creation, Puss in boots, a send up of Zorro. Banderas hisses, purrs and coughs up fur-balls to the delight of the audience. There are plenty of other small cameos including British presenter, Jonathan Ross as an ugly sister his voice specially put in for the British version. Basically the film is pure hilarity and charm start to finish.Shrek 2 is a film that would be extremely hard not to love. The few critics who felt negatively towards this must truly be miserable because it's pure, simple and charming entertainment which is arguably better than the first, perhaps not in terms of thrills but in terms of broader comedy and of course improved animation. I can't see how anyone could not have plenty of laughs out of this and kids especially will love it. For me there was barely a loose cog in a highly efficient, well oiled machine of a movie, it's a film that the cinema is made for. For me this is an animated movie that will be difficult to beat this year, Shark Tale and The Incredibles look great, can they beat this? Who knows? I would say though that I still prefer Finding Nemo to this. However Shrek 2, while not as superb as the alpha list from Pixar of Nemo and Toy Story 1 and 2, it beats their weaker (although still excellent) efforts Monsters Inc and Bugs Life. Fantastic family stuff. ****1/2",9,1,1,29 July 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Kill Me Uma!!!
","Tarantino hits back with a vengeance with perhaps the best action film of the year. Its hip, it's funny, it's stylish and lord does it kick your booty. Quentin has taken inspiration from Honk Kong movies of the seventies, mixed it with a funky soundtrack and has churned out something superbly entertaining and at times extremely gory. The film has the odd moments of trademark QT dialogue but this feels so different to his other films, it is a real departure.The direction is stylish, Yuen Woo Ping's choreography is outstanding as usual and this is just a very entertaining Kung Fu movie, offering something different to the Matrix shenanigans which Kung-fusiasts have been dying for in Hollywood cinema with all the crappy Martial art turkeys like The Transporter and Romeo Must Die. Only Monsieur Jackie Chan has made enjoyable Martial Arts movies in Hollywood in recent years, good ones are few and far between with most choosing to copy the Matrix ahead of the real origins.As with all of QT's films the movie boasts a superb cast. Firstly, Uma Thurman is excellent in her comeback, she has not done anything major since the stinker that was The Avengers.  She strikes back to the crown jewels with ferocity and karate kicks the face of the cinema going public as if to say `I'm back!' I soothed my groin with a bag of frozen peas and thought `You're so welcome Uma, you are so welcome!' When this film was first announced, aside from the feeling of excitement that had me and any movie enthusiast jumping with excitement, I couldn't help but think, Uma Thurman, all size 6, 8 stone of the lass, in a Kung Fu movie, with samurai swords and lord knows what else, all the fighting, all the stunt-work, wire work. Okay a little chauvinist  perhaps and then there's all the Charlie's Angels and the Matrix women kicking ass, would she be able, or would there be a bloke in an Uma wig jumping around the room and hacking off peoples arms. Boy were my mild doubts proved needless. I was with the audience in awe when you see her plain as day unleashing Kung Fu badness. Of course I did have a similar reaction to Keanu Reeves in The Matrix, the fact that the training beforehand and the fact he did most of the fighting himself made it altogether more enjoyable. Her performance is also top rate, holding the movie together. The rest of the cast are all very good too, with Lucy Liu, Darryl Hannah and the legendary David Carradine amongst others.This movie is enjoyable, it seems very authentic, you really feel like your watching a film out of 1970's Hong Kong, and at times it is typically modern. The cinematography is crisp and striking, the score is authentic and pulsating. As per usual the soundtrack is great too. Overall a great flick, it may lack the intelligent scripting of QT's first two films but in terms of sheer escapism this is his best. ****1/2",9,0,1,8 November 2003
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A sweet and tasty treat!!
","Another remake it may be, but this is that rare feat, an improvement. Gene Wilders enjoyable romp has been improved upon by Tim Burton who stays more faithful to the source material while creating the world of Dahl's creation with no expense spared. The sets built in this film are immense and it is mostly set work thankfully. Something which Burton does that I like is to always think 'in camera' rather than fall back on CGI too much.Burton is a visual maestro. He is quirky and highly creative and his sensibilities of dark humour really mix well with Dahl. Only Burton and also Terry Gilliam could really have done this film true justice in the modern era, and Burton does just that. The film is magical, well done and really brings the best out of Dahl's best work. The factory is wild, expressionistic as is the Buckets house. While between Burton's vision and Johnny Depp's effortlessly diverse acting skills, the character of Willy Wonka is brilliantly realised, matching Gene Wilders equally great performance toes to toe. Like Gene Wilder, Depp gives the character a kind of creepy aura, and a sense of a dark underlay. While Wonka is a strange and reclusive figure he certainly seems to have a darker side, an almost sadistic edge. Depp brilliantly portrays this. The thing that makes Johnny Depp arguably the best actor of his generation is that every role is different, wildly different, so diverse and always brilliantly portrayed. Even gods like Pacino, De Niro and Nicholson can often seem to be playing the same old characters over again. His portrayal of Wonka may earn Depp his third consecutive Oscar nomination after years of being criminally ignored.The rest of the cast are all good, with good child performances as the suitably gruesome foursome to enter the factory with Charlie. David Kelly is also superb as Grandpa Joe. However perhaps the star of the show is youngster Freddie Highmore, who previously impressed in another Depp film, Finding Neverland. Highmore surely enters the pantheon of excellent child actors, a pantheon that is sadly not heavily populated. However Highmore really is good. He has a hard role here, no question because while Charlie is a quiet and affable character it is a performance that demands subtlety and acting without dialogue and Highmore does this brilliantly. He is the heart of the movie and gives a performance of shockingly immense gravitas. He can have no higher praise than to have been recommended for the part of Charlie by Depp.Danny Elfman delivers one of his best scores in years and it adds to the magic of the film. This is a good piece of work and a welcome return to full on Burton. Definitely his best film since Sleepy Hollow. ****",9,1,4,6 August 2005
Big Fish," Magical movie! Nice one Burton!
","This is a typically imaginative and charming film from maestro Tim Burton. After the disappointment of Burtons Planet Of The Apes he goes back to his quirky and unique roots. Films like Edward Scissorhands, BeetleJuice, Sleepy Hollow, which are all specialities of Burton and Big Fish has that feeling. It allows him to show of his visual flair, his humour and his charm.Big Fish follows the relationship between Edward Bloom (Albert Finney), a much liked and respected man who is allows spinning exaggerated yarns about his life. His son Will is becoming disenchanted with his dying fathers refusal to tell the truth about stories of his life. Will feels he does not know who is father really is. The film basically shows much of Eds like in flashback told in the style of one of Blooms creatively licensed fairy tales. At the same time we follow the relationship in the present day between Will and his dad as Will tries to investigate who his dad really is. As the film progresses and we see more fantastical snippets of Edwards life, from his encounter with a Witch that reveals how he will die, to him wooing the love of his life Sandra, who he married and has stayed with ever since. Will gradually begins to discover that many of the strange characters and events his father encountered were in fact real, albeit exaggerated, from his friend Karl the 15ft giant to a strange town called Sceptre. By the end f course Will starts to appreciate his fathers stories all the more and feels a connection long since gone.This film is filled with charm and pathos and is just a really enjoyably unique film. The fact that these flashbacks are eccentric stories allows Burton to have full visual flourish. The cast are excellent. Finney is great as Ed Bloom, he steals the show. His performance is both touching and full of boisterous charisma. Jessica Lange is also good as his adoring wife. As for the younger versions of Edward and Sandra, well they are excellently portrayed by Ewan McGregor and delightfully loveable Alison Lohman. Billy Crudup is very good to as Will. There is also great support from Danny Devito, Steve Buscemi and Helena Bonham-Carter.Burtons musical collaborator the legendary Danny Elfman gives us all another virtuoso score and one that is far more understated and low-key than Elfman usually is asked to provide. Overall this is a magical film and a return to form for one of cinemas great visual directors, Tim Burton. ****",9,0,0,9 June 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Carrey's Best Film!! Oscar time?
","From hot screenwriter of the moment, Charlie Kaufman comes this superbly quirky and unique comedy/romance. It's a strange blend of humour and drama with a science fiction premise. Basically after he breaks up with his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet), Joel (Jim Carrey) finds out that he has been erased from her memory by the lacuna corporation. It's a technique that puts patients into a dream as the relive memories of what they want erased and as they relive them they are wiped out. Joel then decides that he wants the procedure because the pain is too much.Kaufmans script is superbly imaginative, if far fetched and combined with the imaginative visual stamp from director Michel Gondry (whose music video background really helps) the film is highly unique. This film also has to be the one that gets Jim Carrey an Oscar nomination. This is by far his best performance it is so subtle and restrained with real pathos that he completely encompasses the character and as such there isn't a hint of Carrey being Carrey. There is no mugging or face pulling of any sort, no flailing of limbs at all. It is a masterful performance of restraint and real accomplishment. Kate Winslet similarly movies away from her image of Kate Winslet as the effervescent Clementine. She is equally superb. She really does portray the quirkiness of Clementine's personality superbly. There is also great support from Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffulo, Kirsten Dunst and Tom Wilkinson. This really is a film that is so far from your typical Hollywood romance that it is immensely enjoyable and simplistic. The plot on occasion near convulsion but it comes clear excellently and the way the beginning links with the end is great stuff. ****1/2",9,1,2,1 November 2004
Once Upon a Time in America," An epic masterpiece of pure cinematic wizardry!
","Sergio Leone's final master-piece and a swan-song to outdo all swan-songs. Once Upon A Time is a purely magical film, as good as Sergio's other Once Upon A Time film, set in the West. A great debate rages as to which film of Sergio's is his best and that is a question I can't answer having not seen all his pieces. There is no doubt he has done several classic films, with his best Westerns and this gangster epic. What makes Sergio's films so magnificent is their timelessness. Leone's visual eye is astounding and while watching some old films can sometimes feel stale, past it. Leone is a director whose use of the camera was revolutionary, dynamic and iconic. Leone is perhaps one of the most inspirational and mimicked directors ever.This is a movie of pure cinematic beauty. It is wonderfully shot and the lighting is fantastic. The sense of timing Leone's films have is amazing with each scene and captured performance magnificent. America is a marvellous movie to behold and never drags, even at near 4 hours. The narrative is told in a Tarantino-esque (I don't like referencing Quentin and make him sound like the inventor of a non-linear plot but he is the most famous user) with the action switching from the end of the 60's when it is set, right back to the 20's. The story is a recounting of the life story of Noodles, growing up from a young street hood, to a big time gangster to a kind of tragically lonely old man. The film focuses on his development through a 50 year period of his life about his friendships, loves, and guilt and betrayal. Noodles is magnificently portrayed by Robert De Niro in a role that a lot regard as one of his all time greats. Like every other aspect of the film, De Niro was tragically ignored by the Academy that year, and the film didn't receive one nomination. That's Oscar politics for you though, the film flopped and was as such ignored. The film shows the absolute pinnacle of perfection in acting (on several fronts, but particularly De Niro and James Woods), directing, cinematography, writing and perhaps most memorably the career best score of Ennio Morricone, Leone's long time collaborator.So the story is great as are the technical and artistic merits of the film, but what of the supporting cast? Well as I said De Niro is outstanding, with James Wood's coming a very close second. Other noteworthy performances arrive from Elizabeth McGovern, Tuesday Weld, Treat Williams, Joe Pesci, Burt Young and many more. What works so brilliantly in this piece is the amount of memorable side characters portrayed by 'name' actors. Brief cameos delivered with memorable class, for example Joe Pesci and Treat Williams who come and go quickly leaving an indelible mark in the film. Special note also goes to the young cast playing the main roles in the early years sections. They are faultless and excellent. Younger actors can often lack polish and maturity in their performances. There aren't a whole load of Dakota Fannings and Haley Joel Osments rolling off a production line. Finding a young actor who can move up from giving an acceptable performance to having the ability to captivate is quite rare, and so for Leone to have found a lot of brilliant young actors who look remarkably like their adult actors playing the older versions of the characters is truly amazing. While most of these young actors didn't go on to bigger and greater fame, one did: Jennifer Connelly. She plays the young Deborah before Elizabeth McGovern (who is the spitting image of the young Connelly). Jennifer Connelly has of course developed into an Oscar winning and excellent actress and in her screen debut here she shows those early signs of excellence at a very youthful 12 yrs of age. Her performance is excellent, and in an integral and key scene that many actors of her age, and indeed older would have buckled under, she is superb. The scene has her giving a recital to the young Noodles (Who is in love with her). The performance is given with such maturity and with such a sense of timing and delivery that it is truly amazing. It was one of the best performances from a young star to ever grace the big screen in my opinion. She was a superb young actress, who developed into a superb actress and her performance here shows genuine talent and of course kudos to Leone for harnessing that ability and extracting it correctly.As I said Morricone's score is marvellous and of the best scores ever. The music of the film has also appeared in the Kill Bill movies as well. Morricone a composer of such a prolific CV manages to deliver a career best score at a stage in his career when he had been around for years. However he found and continues to find, the inspiration not to let his work become stagnant like some composers. Overall this is a film that is regarded as a classic, mentioned in the same breath as the Godfather films and Goodfellas. It is epic, beautiful and in all counts, masterful. *****",10,4,8,18 March 2005
Mission: Impossible," Decent thriller! Cruise's assured action debut!
","This is the best of the two films. It is an enjoyable thriller and has a decent story. The cast is also full of stars, a lot of whom get killed off early on but still it is a film of class. Brian De Palma directs the proceedings well and this is one of his better films. Tom Cruise is excellent, this was his first action role and he looks the part and does his own stunts while other actors like Jean Reno and Ving Rhames also give good performances. As you would expect there are a lot if twists and turns. There is a constant sense of mystery and the fantastic opening, middle and ending will excite, definitely a classy if confused thriller. ****",7,0,1,23 July 2004
From Hell," Tense and Eerie, as ever Depp is excellent!
","I am not a big fan of the horrer genre at all basically becuase most are bad and the fact is I don't get scared by what happens in movies. I don't mind mystery chillers or the more pyschological horrer like this film, the sort of film that substitutes attractive, screaming, 18 year old girls with clearly visible nipples(Rose Mcgowen, Scream) for a developing plot and atmospheric build up. I particularly find little enjoyment from the slasher genre especially teen slashers. Supposed classics like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on elm street I think are so overated. The first Scream I found good though but still over-rated. Anyway this film is a horrer mystery that builds up atmospheric tension and neat plot twists and developments. The lighting and sets in this movie are fantastic. The cast are made up of a host of British thespiens and of course the two hollywood film stars Johnny Depp and the gorgeous Heather Graham. Of course Depp and Graham are there purely to sell the film ahead of their acting talents which are considerable. Johnny Depp in the last three years has stared in three excellent horrer flicks of various styles, this, Sleepy Hollow and the Ninth Gate. All with him featuring a different style character with a different accent. Depp has proven himself as a brilliant character actor. In 'From Hell' he stars as a detective who has visions and is a drug addict. He is on the case of Jack the Ripper with the help of the equally good Robbie Coltrane. The Ripper is killing prostitutes and has targeted five working girls in particular for his ritualistic murders. They include Grahams characters as well as Lesley Sharp and Annabelle Apison as two of the other Whores, the remaining two I know by face from other films but cannot think of their names. The film is very effective, it has its tense moments and towards the end of the film we get more gore as the ripper starts to rampage. Both the American leads do very good cockney accents as do the British luvvies. As for the plot well it nears the point of losing the audience with plot twists and conspiracy theories but the big twists of the film are generally surprising. I was sitting in my seat and half an hour in I thought I'd worked it out, I was well proud of myself and had a grin like a cheshire cat until the Rippers identity was made clear and frankly I was way off. Some moments are quite obvious but that is the case of any movie in history. Overall this was a very good chiller, the story was good and the plot twists were also surpising. I loved the recreation of 19th century London and the lighting effects the film really takes you to another time and place (unless your from london then its just another time). Although the film is good it is one of those that is rather forgettable, I won't remember much in a few weeks except for the plot twist. 8/10",8,0,1,10 February 2002
Total Recall," An Arnold classic!
","As you'd expect coming from a Phillip K Dick short story, this film has an interesting view of the future and certainly has a debatable conclusion to it. `Was Qauid dreaming?' Well its not quite the same classic movie question as another K. Dick based film had, that being `Is Deckard a Replicant' from Blade Runner. This is not in the same league as Blade Runner, it falls short on all respects except for the action,  this brings you excessive violence that you'd expect from a Paul Verhoven film. This hasn't got the deep meanings that Blade Runner had, this won't be studied in quite the same way but it is not the films intent. It is in parts a satirical look at the future of mankind, part visual delight and part excessively violent action flick. We have come to expect this combination from Verhoven and it works well.The cast are good in the most part. Arnold as we all know is the lead. If this had leant towards different aspects than action then he would not have been suited but for the violence involved there was only one man who could have played Qauid at the time and that was Arnold. This is his ideal role, little to say and lots of mayhem to cause. He does well in his role and gives one of his best performances. Schwarzenegger revelled in these violent films, snapping necks and Verhoven definitely pushes the boundary's of taste where the action is concerned. I enjoyed the gorish nature immensely but some may find it too much. The plot for an action film is very good, we have this ordinary guy who has an obsession with mars, he then goes to a place called Total Recall, where they implant memory's. It's kind of like the ultimate holiday service without the sun tan and the packing of bags. This seems to trigger off a memory in his head that he already has of Mars so the guys at Recall knock him out and dump in a cab. Then from that moment he finds his life is in danger. He has to find out why and stay alive. After he receives help from unknown and known allies he goes to mars, all the time with a man called Richter after him, played villainously good by Michael Ironside. There are twists an turns as you'd expect and the ending poses the question of whether the whole thing was a dream. Anyway as well as Arnold and a near show stealing turn by Michael Ironside we have solid main cast supported by some bad actors such as Richters right hand man. Ronny Cox also revels in his Bad guy role and like many Schwarzenegger films we have some excellent support to balance out Arnolds limitations as an actor, this is true to nearly all the action stars, particularly of that time, Van Damme, Seagal et al. Also in her pre mega fame days, before Basic Instinct we have the sexy Sharon Stone in a delightfully bitchy and villainous role as Qauids supposed wife who tries to kill him. She is good and you could almost say watchable simply for the fact she is so hot. Rachel Ticotin is also good as Melina, who teams with Arnold.The visuals in this film are great, from the special effects to the recreation of Mars, the production design have brought to life some great imagery and this is definitely Arnolds best film in that respect. One great scene is Arnolds meeting with Kauto who helps him remember about a machine that Mars previous inhabitants created that could bring air to the planet, its a visual effects master class and a dizzyingly eerie look. Also the music is great too. Verhoven is a pretty tasteless director as he certainly showed in Showgirls but in general his direction is good and stylish. Overall this is one of the Austrian Oaks best and probably Verhovens best. It is a classic in some respects while you won't see any Oscar winning acting or dialogue, its basically a great story put into an average script. I hope they bring out a special feature laden DVD soon! 9/10.",9,1,2,2 July 2002
Rocky," Yo Adrian!! This is a classic!!
","Sly Stallones greatest ever film! The sequels may have been more simplistic, forgetting that the boxing part was actually a sub-plot, but they are all enjoyable. This film is the most meaningful though. The relationship between Rocky and Adrian takes centre stage and despite the un-realistic story with respect of the boxing, this is more engaging, this is basically an against the odds movie, not designed for realism but to have elements of realism in it. The script is good and Sly hasn't written anything nearly as good since. What makes this film so successful however are the fantastic performances. Stallone is excellent as Rocky, its a fantastic performance right down to the way Rocky moves and the mannerisms, while Talia Shire is equally good as Adrian. The scenes between Sly and Talia are movie magic. Burgess Meredith is also excellent and there is a fantastic turn form Burt Young as Adrian's abusive brother Paulie. This isn't mindless escapism like the sequels, its pure drama. *****",10,0,0,23 July 2004
The Descent," Fantastico!
","Completely out of the blue this film hit horror fans for six, and general movie fans too. The Descent is a movie very much in the tradition of Alien and The Thing and represents probably the best creature horror since The Thing. Director Neil Marshall sets the film up to play on the audiences fears of, the dark, being buried alive, confined spaces, and the unknown. It's a simple idea that Marshall has to put these women down into a cave with merely flashlights and flares to light their way, but as the history of this genre will show you, it's so, so easy to get wrong (The Cave, essentially the Hollywood, and as such less artistic and subtle, version of this). Marshall who did the highly rated comedy horror Dog Soldiers before this, steps up a gear for The Descent, delivering a genuinely creepy and unnerving horror film. The film is brilliantly shot and the use of locales is superb, particularly the antithesis of the wide open Scottish countryside at the films beginning, with the claustrophobic atmosphere of the caves.The plot follows a group of women, always searching for the next natural high. This year it is caving. One of the women, Sarah, lost her husband and her daughter in a tragic accident the year before, on her way back home after some white water rafting. While the instigator of the ladies adventures, Juno, harbours guilty feelings because she had been having an affair with the husband. So we already know something will come to a head inside the cave between the two, once best friends. The caving starts off okay until a section collapses leaving the (attractive naturally) ladies having to find an alternate route out. As the film progresses it's not only the dangers of the caves terrain that the ladies overcome but also the horrible looking bat people dwelling inside, who naturally have a taste for human flesh.What makes this film work is the fact that Marshall makes you care about the characters. He gives them all a personality. Similarly the film has no stars in it and there's a surprise factor as you try and guess who'll get picked off and in what order. Similarly it's very atmospheric and well shot, and the score from David Julyan (whose brilliant work in Christopher Nolan's first three movies, I loved) is ambient and suitably indicative of the horror to come. All the cast are excellent, particularly Natalie Mendoza and Shauna MacDonald. Marshall too directs with assurance, and flair, perfectly capturing the caves in much the same way Ridley Scott captured the confines of the ship and it's air ducts in Alien. Marshall is building himself a reputation for doing quality British genre movies, and doing them very well. Lets see if he can keep it up. All in all the Descent isn't merely a decent movie of its type, it is in fact one of the best of its genre. A film that will continue to garner a cult following. It's a movie that American filmmakers of late have seemingly just viewed as impossible to do with subtlety, and skill and decent acting. Intent to go for cheap and therefore ineffectual scares. The Descent takes time to build up it's tension, and knows when to pull the audience in, only to give them a jolt of pants dampening fear when they least expect it. While the brilliant score from Julyan is anything but schlocky, overwrought and predictable. A brilliant film. ****1/2",9,3,7,21 September 2006
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Very entertaining!
","I used to, in fact I still do, love fantasy films for example Labyrinth, Masters of the universe, Princess bride and of course the first three star wars films. Fantasy films have the most imaginative of set designs and costumes and when done well take you to another world for 90 or so minutes. Since the 80's these films have dried up, very rarely are they released and even rarer now are they good. The last I can remember was Phantom Menace but that wasn't great, plus there is an overuse of effects to, I like to see an actor walking on a set for real. All of a sudden Harry Potter comes out which will be quickly followed by Lord of the rings. I went not knowing what to expect, I had heard 99% excellent reviews, but would this sort of film still appeal to me? answer yes. This film gets the balance between kids fun and subtley included adult jokes perfectly, it has moments of universal joy and the set designs are brilliant as are the effects, the effects thankfully are not overused either. Most films of this type would have an adult in the lead for the purpose really of experienced acting skills despite a child being more accessible for the younger audience, but thankfully the three principle child actors are good in their roles, the supporting cast of the younger generation range from average to quite wooden but they will get better with age. As a critic said the three main kids are not portrayed as to cutsie like the case might have been, aside from their magical skills they are seemingly you average run of the mill kids you see every day in the highstreet or whatever. Basically this film has a universal appeal and I would say is the first decent non cartoon fantasy of the 90's. Its solid entertainment. ***",6,0,1,6 December 2001
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Brilliance!
","Have movie audiences been spoilt this year? We sure have! Continuing a long line of immensely enjoyable films at the big screen, the fourth instalment of the series is far and away the best, and considering the class of the last one, that is some achievement. This time around the director is for the first time a Brit, Mike Newell. Newell's appointment raised questions about whether the film would have the visual impact to impress movie fans, in the wake of the previous movie and of course recent fantasy epics like Star Wars and LOTR. All worries though were not needed because Newell knocks this one out of the park. This year marks the tri-wizard tournament, hosted by Hogwarts. The tournament sees three schools competing against each other by sending out a single champion from each school. The selections are made using the Goblet Of Fire. Names are put into it and drawn out. The three champions are drawn but in a bizarre twist the Goblet fires out a fourth name, Harry Potter, despite the fact he's too young to enter. The whole school, including Harry's best mate Ron, think Harry has cheated somehow. However despite being too young the Goblet is a magically binding contract and so Harry has to compete in the three deadly tasks. All the while we have the re-emergence of Voldemort casting an eerie presence over the film. Also the Hogwarts prom night is on the horizon leading to the first awkward adolescent crushes of the series thus far. Yes Harry and his mates are indeed growing up and Newell doesn't want to pull any punches. When the film has to be nasty it is nasty, and when it has to have hormonally charged teenagers acting smitten it does so realistically. These guys are 14 years old in the film and like me and others when that age, are horny little buggas. Suddenly the guys are becoming gawky and awkward around the girls and Hermoine is sprouting into a young woman, and catching the eye of Ron and rival school competitor and quidditch God Victor Krum. The film actually has sexual tension and a fair old dose of innuendo in it so is quite daring. Not to mention Harry himself gets sexually assaulted by a ghost!The film really captures the essence of being that age, whilst also keeping the adventure side suitably dark. This film really is dark and some people may find it too dark for a kids movie. However I now think along the lines that the Harry Potter movies are turning into more adult movies. Certainly the last one was dark and didn't appeal to kids of 12 and under as much as the candy coated first two films, but Potter 4 will probably alienate the kiddies. This film was pretty scary I have to tell you. I nearly crapped my pants several times and I urge you never to watch this film in a theatre or room with too many young children in because the smell would be unbearable. Newell is clearly making a film he'd like to see and being an adult he needs to be challenged viscerally and this makes for a great movie. This really is a top class fantasy film and Peter Jackson would be proud. Visually as I mentioned this looks stunning, the cinematography is superb, the film looks Gothic at times, while we are given more focus on the actors. The camera gets right into them and stays for longer than previous instalments. This now means there is immense pressure on the kids to deliver acceptable performances and they duly delivered. Emma Watson, although a more peripheral figure this time is excellent, really coming along as an actress and will certainly have a bright future, while Rupert Grint as Ron is the same and really delivers a great turn. However up until now the one actually always considered the weakest of the three, Daniel Radcliffe, really steps forward and delivers a superb performance of maturity, that really goes hand in hand with the character of Potter, who has to learn to grow up fast. Newell clearly has spent time with these kids, and it shows, especially with Radcliffe who is given a testing role and doesn't put a foot wrong. Of course as with previous Potter movies we are blessed with an outstanding ensemble cast. Returnees Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane are all top class. Then we have the always reliable and entertaining Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter. Current Dr Who David Tennant makes a creepy appearance to but the two standouts are firstly Ralph Fiennes who appears towards the end of the film as Lord Voldemort. He is cack your underpants scary. Fiennes is taking this really seriously, he wants Voldemort scary, he wants him nasty, he doesn't want any hint of the pantomime villain. When Harry comes face to face with him we know the boy will have to do something special to avoid dying. Fiennes though is eclipsed by Brendon Gleeson as Mad Eye Moody. Gleeson is superb as the dark arts teacher, who is clearly one sandwich short of a picnic. It's a great role and certainly a performance of both menace and quirk that could see him recognised by the Oscars.Someone who'll definitely be getting a nomination is John Williams who continues this years fine form from Star Wars 3 and War Of The Worlds, to deliver his best score yet with this film. It's atmospheric, creepy, majestic and very rarely falls back to the memorable Potter themes. This is not a movie for repeating theme tunes the music has to creep in and out to match each scene, bringing in the recognisable Potter jingle with choice and subtlety. It goes without saying Williams could have three nominations this year! Outstanding film and the most exciting of the year. *****",10,1,1,6 December 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," The biggest showpiece of the summer!!!, but a slight letdown
","The first was a classic and quite possibly the greatest action or science fiction film ever. The sequel had an uphill task matching its predecessor and while it can't match it in the story department and character department, in the sheer scale of the action it manages to top the first film and that is an impressive feat.The films significant problem is being a middle part, there is no real conventional start and finish. No real exposition, and no resolution, we have the complication and the climax but we are left open mouthed waiting for the third chapter like a baby having it's ice lolly snatched away on a hot day. The opening grabs you by the nad's and sets the level for the action, once again it looks great. Then there is forty minutes of pondering, this is where the basic expo is given. There is more talk of prophecies and destiny etc and a few scenes that could have been trimmed. Neo is still unsure of himself and his new found powers and awaits word and guidance from the Oracle. He is also visited by troubling dreams involving his lover Trinity.Once he meets the Oracle and discovers something shocking about her, the action kicks in and the film shifts into overdrive. The story in this is good, it does suffer by not being told in the conventional way but of course this is a middle part so that will always be a problem, also some of the dialogue is hokey and is more noticeable in this one than the more engrossing first film.The story itself has some great revelations and leaves some interesting questions, hence my need to see the third part more so than any other follow up to another film. The cast are once again good, balancing the posterior inside the Matrix with their more vulnerable sides in the real world and of course looking like Kung-Fu gods. Hugo Weaving takes delight in chewing the scenery in this, while disappointingly Carrie Ann Moss doesn't look nearly as sexy as she did in the first instalment, usually sporting dirt and a rather dodgy barnet. Of some of the new cast, Jada Pinkett Smith is playing Trinity's black clone but still looks good (oh those eyes!) and Monica Belluci has a juicy role as a sexy Vamp, she is very sexy and steals her scenes and like some people say Belluci means cleavage in Italian, on the evidence of this it must be true.The action is the number one asset of this film aside from the fantastic cinematography and atmospheric score. All the action will blow your nuts off, especially the much talked about burly brawl between Neo and 100 Agent Smiths (yes it is true and jaw droppingly good) as well as a 15 minute car chase through a town and then on a freeway, particularly exciting is Trinity weaving through oncoming traffic at 140 mph. Only the action in the Hulk comes close to this out of the summers movies. The action really is chair grippingly, ball sweatingly, eye crossingly good.The film is flawed yes, but, it is still interesting, all that we learn about Neo and the Matrix is intriguing and the final segment can't come soon enough. Definitely the most exciting movie this year and the most groundbreaking. ****",8,0,0,18 July 2003
It's a Wonderful Life," It's a wonderful film!!
","I watched this, believe it or not, for the very first time this week. I usually find it difficult to watch old films, some of them don't have the sheer timelessness that films like this and Citizen Kane do.  I don't  like those old films where people burst into song at the drop of a hat either, its not my cup of tea.	Anyway, this was put on in my film studies class and I have to say that it was a fantastically made movie, you rarely see films of this nice natured ilk anymore. It is basically about a guy called George Bailey who feels like he has failed and wasted his life, he figures it would be better if he had never been born. The start of the film introduces us to an Angel called Clarence who hasn't got his wings. He is given a brief recount of Georges life, from his childhood to his adulthood, full of lost ambitions to travel and create. Having been told of Georges life, Clarence must now save him and make him see how important his life is. 	I think the key thing in this film is the real Christmassy spirit it has, you don't get that anymore, even in real Christmassy movies, that's because in the last ten years in particular, the Christmas spirit has been falling with the dramatic rise in commercialism and broken families. The performances are great too. James Stewart really does shine here, it is one of the great performances in movie history, from what I have seen, he is really likeable and he is just fantastic in his role, its a real lesson for wannabe actors.	Overall I would say that this is worthy of its classic status and I will certainly watch it when it is on at Christmas. 10/10",Null,1,5,19 December 2002
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Great fun!
","Summer is finally upon us it seems as blockbuster season is now kicking in. We have had Star Wars and now it's the Brad and Angelina movie. The name of the film escapes me, because this has been referred to as 'That film.' by so many media resources, in and out of the movie industry. The plot, such as it is borrows heavily from True Lies and War Of The Roses and has a bizarre melding of the two. What it does though is include the fun factor of those two excellent pieces of Saturday night fodder. Brad and Angie play a husband and wife, who lead double lives. By day a now bored married couple and at night gallivanting off in varied locations scrubbing out scum for their respective agencies. When out on conflicting missions they find out that the other is in fact also an assassin. Furthermore they are under instruction to kill each other. Now both Mrs and Mr have to face up to the question; do they love the other? Of course the end up trying to kill each other but when they get down to it they realise they love each other, blah-blahdy-blah! Then of course they team up against their organisations who have sold them out. This is essentially an excuse for lots of action and witty banter, and for a Sunday evening after hard days work, it's exactly the sort of undemanding brainless action flick you need. While other action blockbusters can tend to feel soulless and churned out by the Hollywood machine, this film has some class to it, thanks to indie director Doug Liman, who doesn't make this film too Hollywood. It's a fun movie, pure and simple.As for the cast, well Brad and Angie have great chemistry and that also makes this a grade-up from the usual gun fests. Like Arn and Jamie Lee or Michael and Kathleen, they spark well off each other. Pitt proves himself a capable action man while keeping his everyman likability. Vince Vaughn also pops up in a funny bit part as Pitt's buddy and business associate in the whacking game. The rest of the cast have very little to do to be honest, it's essentially a three man show, and one of that three man team is a woman, the rather gorgeous Angelina Jolie. MY GOD! Jolie is a real walking advertisement for hand cream for the hairy handed adolescent in all of us. She is astonishing beautiful, and I'll tell you what else, she could kick Brad Pitt's butt from here to Bangkok with her hands behind her back, she is an ass kicking machine. This is Angelina's movie, she's a dynamo, a sex goddess, as well as being as good actress of course.Elsewhere John Powell provides a simple and effective score while the film looks great too. The film is also full to the brim with cracking action. You have gun fights, fist fights, car chase and masses of fiery explosions, the film is pure eye candy on every level. The audience can gorge themselves on carnage while in the separate demographics, the ladies have Pitt to drool over while us guys can sit there transfixed by Jolie. Angelina kept my gaze locked upon her. God knows what Pitt was doing while the two shared the shot because I would have been concentrating on Jolie.All in all this is a good fun movie, simple, yet exciting. ***1/2",7,1,7,12 June 2005
The Departed," Masterpiece.
","When this project was first announced as Scorsese's next film; there was undoubtedly a sense of trepidation from the movie goers. Perhaps a sense, from myself included, that Martin was selling out, and following the Hollywood bandwagon, in its pursuit to remake, or redo. We are rife with remakes and sequels, spin offs and the rest, with nary an original film in site these days. Rightly it was a concern that Mart was re-doing one of the best films to ever come out of Hong Kong. A concern that would be the same if he'd done the Killer over again, or any of the decidedly few master pieces from the land the brought us Jackie Chan. And what is the result? The result, thankfully, is a rare remake that betters the original, and is also one of Scorsese's best films. Certainly it's his best since Goodfella's and already is being talked about as a masterpiece, that will retain the same adoration that Fellas, Taxi Driver and Raging Bull still have to this day. It's certainly able to stand toe to toe with his previous best works, three of the finest movies ever made. Will it become a regular in the age old argument of what is Scorsese's best film? Ask me in ten years time! Anyway, the Departed is a fabulous film. In truth the film, for me, started off quite slow. As I initially sat and watched, I felt a sense that the film has been hyped, praised and placed on a pedestal, perhaps not its worth. It's an opening period while the story catches up to the here and now, and while we acclimatise ourselves to the Boston accents, that jar initially to how we recognise Nicholson et al, as speaking in real life. No sooner does the tale switch into the realm's of intrigue, and psychological study though, do we see it begin to become engrossed into a thoroughly brilliant piece of work, and in truth it's important to remember that even Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and to a less extent, Goodfella's, started the same. Arguably it's a great way to really suck the audience in, letting them ease themselves into the experience.The story is full of twists and turns with essentially Di Caprio's undercover cop ingratiating himself into the world of Boston big boss gangster, Frank Costello (Nicholson). Simultaneously, there's Colin Sullivan, a state policeman, and almost an adopted son to Costello, who keeps Costello constantly informed of the polices investigations against him. As both characters get deeper into their roles, both lose their identity, and become darker, particularly the once do-gooder, Billy Costigan , played by Di Caprio. It's not long before Costello suspects a rat in his organisation, and the police too suspect a mole in theirs. The film is full of surprise and is paced exceptionally well, until the inevitable climax.The cast are first rate. Di Caprio is outstanding, really shining again. Since starring in Titanic, he's moved away from mainstream as much as possible. He's also picked and chosen his roles carefully, and not in much regularity. Again Di Caprio firmly establishes himself as one of the finest actors to have emerged in the last ten years. He is currently Scorsese's go to man, and this generations De Niro, or Pacino. If there were any question marks over him being merely a poster boy, then this puts them to rest. Di Caprio, is an actor of the highest calibre. Jack Nicholson also delivers in a role that could so easily have been from his 1970's heydey. So dark in so Jack. He's tried to play his age a bit more in recent times, and also go quirky. But here, there's a dark side to Nicholson, and intensity that evokes many of his early masterpieces. Nicholson could be a good bet for an Oscar nomination (he's not the only one in this). Mark Wahlberg delivers his best performance too, while Martin Sheen, Vera Farmiga, Ray Winstone and Alec Baldwin are all excellent. For me though Matt Damon stands out here. He delivers a superb performance, and again is a fine actor who oft gets question marks over his validity as a top HW performer. Perhaps his association with Ben Affleck holds him back but lest we not forget, Damon is already an Oscar nominated actor. With this role, and his role in the upcoming The Good Shepard, Damon could really put himself right up as one of the top talents around. He, as Leo, Nicholson and also Baldwin, should be receiving an Oscar nod for his work here.Scorsese as per usual shoots this brilliantly. His sense of imagery, pacing, and direction is almost unsurpassable in the modern era. The film looks the part, as well as having gorgeous photography, a brilliant score and one hell of a soundtrack. All in all, The Departed is the first awe-inspiring, potential masterpieces, since Schindler's List. It's a film worthy of being in the HW golden period of the 70's when guys like Scorsese, Polanski, Forman, Coppolla, Lumet, reigned supreme. This will only continue to gain more and more status. *****",10,0,2,12 October 2006
Die Hard," The greatest action movie ever made!
","At the end of the 80's, that were all about shirtless muscle bound supermen taking on hundreds of foreign terrorists single-handed, Die Hard came out and changed the course of the action genre, whilst still having a shirtless and muscular (although not in Arnold or Dolph standards) hero, taking on a group of foreign terrorists single-handed. Die Hard though features a hero who is markedly more human and real than his rival action hero's. McClane is an ordinary guy and he damn near gets killed in this film and gets the hell beaten out of him, He takes a pummelling the likes of which Schwarzengger never received in the 80;s. He got a scratch at most.So what makes Die Hard the single greatest action movie ever, and I'm talking action movie with an action hero and plenty of action, a proper lads movie. This is easily the best. The basic premise is basic. Terrorists take over a building and Bruce Willis in the right place at the right time (or wrong?) is on hand to stop them. Yet the film has a brilliant script. This is chock full of witty writing (The two agent Johnson's, the idiotic police chief, the slimy co-worker Ellis), set-ups and pay-offs and great little touches. Die Hard also features some scenes that are hilarious. It's just funny and combined with the direction of John McTiernan, this is a thrill ride start to finish and unsurpassed in its combination of action and humour.Furthermore Willis is superb and also it must be noted can act, and is allowed to. It can be argued that Arnold, Jean Claude, Steven and Dolph are not great thespians, and it'd be a well granted argument. Doing the simple stuff is not a problem, but stretching the acting muscles reveals that those muscles are not nearly as defined as the bicep, tricep and whatever-cep, muscles! Then there is Sly Stallone who can act given the chance, yet aside from First Blood his action movies don't allow him for more than 6 lines of dialogue or much in the way of stretching. Willis however rejuvenates the action hero character by giving him personality, following on from Mel Gibson's Riggs (Lethal Weapon), the year before. He has personality, he speaks and he emotes. He's not cool as ice, he is a real guy in an extraordinary situation. Willis delivers a great performance here, one of the best in an action man movie, because he's human, and charismatic. Similarly the rest of the cast are great. Generally a lot of action movies aren't too concerned with the co-stars acting talents, because the leads aren't much kop, but Die Hard loads the film with good actors, everyone delivering. This makes for a more exciting movie when the actors are so convincingly real. Alan Rickman is superbly slimy and cool as Hans Gruber, the super slick German terrorist whose icy demeanour is only ever pierced by the annoying and troublesome McClaine. Then we have number 1, baddest bad guy henchman ever, the big blond fella Karl played by Alexander Gudonov. Not forgetting Bonnie Bedelia, Reg VelJohnson, Paul Gleason, Robert Davi and Grant Bush. McTiernan is one of the masters of crafting an action scene. Sadly when recounting his work, he hasn't hit the bull's-eye on enough of his movies, yet in Die Hard and Predator he emerged as one of the action king directors of the decade, along with Jim Cameron, Walter Hill and Richard Donner to name a few. The action here is superb and not forgetting in a setting that could have caused problems creating enough varied and well choreographed action scenes. Above all this has scale, it's big. it's the equivalent of the big bloated blockbusters of today that rise past 150 million dollars in cost, yet lack the skill of this film.Die Hard features quality in all departments from the cast, the crew to the superb score from Michael Kamen, and thus far no other action film comes close to this ones entertainment and repeatability. *****",10,3,4,30 January 2006
War of the Worlds," It's official: Dakota Fanning is scary good!!
","If ever there was a sure fire, safe bet kind of a film this year, it was always going to be War Of The Worlds. You have the ingredients there for a great movie. We have Spielberg multiplied by Cruise which is the square root of Dakota Fanning. It is a simple mathematic equation; that these elements combined will make at the very least a good movie. War of The Worlds, while not the best addition to Cruise or Spiely's catalogue is still a top class summer movie and the best Alien invasion movie so far. To sum up War Of The Worlds you could say that the first 2 acts are classic, top draw stuff, perhaps the best this year, while the third act drops the standard when introducing a needlessly cast Tim Robbins, before ending, some felt, rather abruptly. More on that later however.Firstly the films strength's. This film has amazing action. Really amazing action, the best use of CGI this year. The CGI is used so effectively and made to look so real. The camera never sits still and lovingly gazes at the computer imagery to the point we see that it is fake and see the seams as it were. Spielberg uses the camera to disorientate and give flashing glimpses of massive killer tripods zapping people into dust while Cruise and his fellow publicans run like the wind. The effects are astonishing but we don't focus on them too long in each shot, allowing us to keep the feeling we are seeing something genuine. As the action ripped along I was on the edge of my seat. The effects, the sound, the direction all combining to create some truly chilling and pulse pounding sequences, especially the first sitting of the tripods. As well as the action we have a core family story we care about. Now of course they have raided the cliché box as this is after all a disaster movie made in Hollywood, so Tom Cruise plays the bad father who eventually comes good, while Justin Chatwin is his angst ridden teenage son. Thankfully young starlet Dakota Fanning is given a character a bit different to the norm, a freakishly intelligent and quirky daughter. Of course this is due to the fact that Fanning is a freakishly good actress and plays a role 99% pf child actors couldn't play, so generally the play little hyperactive brats. At times Fanning is the heart of the movie thanks to having a fairly unique character combined with a unique level of talent for someone her age. The movie is helped along by it's primary cast. Cruise is superb. He really delves into the character again and it's not the usual heroic and faultless character again that Cruise plays, it is another departure for him for this type of movie, much like the flawed character in Last Samurai. Cruise can act, no question and here he gets to stretch, while the chemistry between himself and his kids, Chatwin and Fanning, really make the family dynamic engaging. Cruise could be an outside bet for an Oscar nod this year, having been unlucky in previous years missing out for Samurai and Collateral. Justin Chatwin is excellent as well. He pulls of a stretching role for someone fairly new to the business. Then there is the frighteningly good Fanning who just darn well scares me because she is too good for an 10 year old. Remember feeling that way after seeing Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense? A performance of such intensity and maturity that it seemed like it had come from a veteran of 40 years. Fanning is the same, and in some ways too good and mature to be a realistic kid. However her character, like Osment's in Sense, is a strange character with strange tendencies and the part is good. It's a character actors part in some senses. I still find it scary though. Elsewhere Miranda Otto has an extended cameo and little to do, while Tim Robbins seems to serve little more purpose that to have some extra complication and to add a star name.Spielberg is on fine form and goes quite dark in parts. The central character Ray for example steals a car at someone else's expense, who were probably left to be zapped to oblivion while he also beats another guy to death. The action is also top notch as I mentioned earlier but for as much as Spielberg goes dark, he does end up playing it safe. Where he could have wiped out a few characters he chose to have the happy ending for the Ferrier family. Also while the film was a departure for Cruise, we still had a few super Cruise moments, with him being the first person to both damage and destroy one of the aliens machines. The film ended abruptly and felt like a good 15 minutes was chopped. Not so much the explanation which I liked and which stayed faithful to the book, very much an ode to Darwin, but the way it shifts from one setting to the sudden end of the film without necessarily having a final showpiece. The ending itself was good and the explanation worked but what was slightly off was the pacing of it.Overall despite some off moments this is still a great movie that won't disappoint. Fine performances combine well with cracking action. Technically as well this is superlative from the music, to the cinematography and effects, absolutely top class. ****",8,0,4,6 July 2005
Wedding Crashers," Funniest film for years! MOTOR-BOAT!
","So far it has been a very productive and enjoyable year in the movie world and with the big comedy movie of the summer having arrived, yet again audiences won't be disappointed. This is a comedy dream team-up here with Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. The two have been regulars in the Ben Stiller posse and this time these two titans share the screen. Of all the team-ups you could imagine from the Wilson's, Vaughn. Stiller, Ferrell and Black, the Wedding Crashers has perhaps the most interesting and indeed the two spark off each other superbly.Crashers is a very funny movie. In fact it is riotous at times. I have not laughed as hard as I did watching this at the cinema before. I was crying I tell you, crying in a theatre full of witnesses, and everyone else was crying with me, crying with uncontrollable laughter. This is a good solid R-rated movie and in good old England my home a very adult 15 certificate and it really pushes that rating very close to a full 18 certificate, and in fact I am shocked this film wasn't rated 18. This film really pushes the limits of taste, but does so superbly. This features perhaps the best dining room scene ever, the funniest rape scene ever, and the funniest motor-boat impression ever. Why is the film funny? It just is. It's down to great comical performances and outrageous situations.The story revolves around two wedding crashers who crash weddings in order to get laid. They have been doing so for years, however John (Wilson) is getting tired and questioning whether or not they should be doing it at their age. Vaughn insists they should live a little while they are still young however Wilson points out that they are not that young anymore. Of course the two still crash weddings and set about hitting the mother-load at the wedding of the year. At the wedding Wilson meets and becomes infatuated with Claire (Rachel MacAdems) while Vaughn sees her younger sister, Gloria (Isla Fisher) but merely as a notch on his belt. Of course the Wilson plot-line is your typical rom-com plot-line where two people meet, begin to fall for each other, but on the pretence of a lie, which later comes out and threatens to wreck any hope of the inevitable happy ending. This is your atypical rom-com stuff but thankfully doesn't become too perfunctory, keeping the laughs on a high, even at the climax of the film, when a lot of staple rom-com scenes play out. However most of the films big laughs involve Vaughn's plot line where he gets more than he bargained for with Fisher who turns out to be a psychotic and clingy nymphomaniac.The cast are great. Wilson is as laid back and easy going as ever, while MacAdems is just adorable. However Vince Vaughn is a one man show. Vaughn is absolutely top class here, on fire. Isla Fisher is just superb as the deranged sister and she and Vaughn have some of the funniest scenes I have seen in ages. There is also good support from Christopher Walken and a rather hot Jane Seymour (Milf!) as his wife, who keeps trying to seduce Wilson to hilarious effect. Elsewhere Will Ferrell turns up for a funny cameo as a guy who crashes funerals.Overall this film is pure hilarity. A great comedy with great scenes. ****",9,4,10,21 July 2005
Con Air," A pure thrill ride from start to finish!!
","Nicholas Cage has proven himself as an action star in my mind. What he gives you, that you won't get from people like Arnie and Van Damme etc, is the ability to convincingly play a character with more than two dimensions, he can easily do roles in action films with his eyes closed as the characters do not require to much stretching. Of course when it comes to the action itself he has been doubled too much for my liking. Although he was pretty good in Con Air it must be said, Cage was in great shape in this movie. He has been in three classic action films. This, Face Off and the Rock. In The Rock and Face Off he was doubled annoyingly every second, but he is more involved in this film. Basically Con Air is your typicle macho man action flick, full of one-liners and angry stares but what sets this apart is the amazing energy produced by the direction, set pieces and the standard of actors you don't usually get in this genre. Nic Cage is good although his accent is a little difficult to take in at times, he gets it spot on but it just doesn't suit him. Also John Cusack is in great form as an FBI agent who is responsible for the plane that subsequantly becomes hi-jacked and terrorist controlled. As for the villiansof the piece, well Ving Rhames stars as Diamond Dog and is very good and John Malkovich excels as lead baddie Cyrus the Virus (all the bad guys have stupid names). This film has many of the stupid cliches of the action genre but the amazing action sequences, quality score and the stars make this a must see. The plot may be thin but do we really care in an action flick. Overall this is a great flick, and I really appreciate those few action flicks that employ top actors to add something in that department. Some of the scenes really raise the excitment levels pretty high. 9/10",9,0,1,28 March 2002
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Comical mastery!!
","It's been a year of entertainment and some great movies and there has so far been a good standard in comedies. A lot of the comedies have been the usual poor Hollywood tripe but this year we have now probably seen above the average in genuinely funny comedies, far above the average in fact. There has been School Of Rock, Stuck On You, Starsky And Hutch, Scary Movie 3, Shrek 2, Shaun Of The Dead and now Anchorman, all this and I've yet to see Dodgeball that has had a positive response from critics. Anchorman is the years second appearance from Will Ferrell who appeared in a small role in Starsky And Hutch and Ferrell is one of the upcoming stars of the comedy genre. While Eddie Murphy and Steven Martin seem destined to make poor movies made primarily for young kids and are drifting into the land of the unfunny where dinosaurs like Mel Brooks, Rodney Dangerfield play table tennis with Chevy Chase and other former comical masters and box office greats. The current king of comedy Jim Carrey looks set to move away from slapstick, face contorting mugging and into more serious roles because he has the acting ability to do so. So the likes of Owen Wilson, Ben Stiller, Jack Black and of course Ferrell are the new guard coming in to rescue us from boredom and tickle our funny bones. Anchorman is a simple yet excellent premise set during the 70's. Ron Burgendy is a news Anchorman, the best of the best and a mans man and when Veronica comes into the office as firstly a news reporter, Ron and his team of co-horts are suddenly thrown into disarray. Ron initially falls in love with her but after the split he tries to sabotage her and the end up in a bitter feud to become the best anchor. It's all predictable but in truth the story isn't important in a film like this. This is merely a film with a character and situations that allow Ferrell to display his comic genius. Much like School Of Rock was the Jack Black show, this is the Will Ferrell show. It's all about Ferrell, he accounts for the majority of the films entertainment. If Ferrell wasn't as funny as he is the film wouldn't get by on the scripts jokes or the story it's essentially simplistic stuff, almost a blank canvass for Ferrell to work his artistry. Ferrell is unbelievably funny. I like Ferrell but I needed proof he could hold a movie in a lead role, he proves it here. I needed similar proof from Jack Black and he delivered in School Of Rock. Ferrell has excellent support from everybody's favourite former sexy-sitcom daughter, Christina Applegate who is more than adept at comedy. Also some supporting characters by Paul Rudd, Vince Vaughn and a particularly funny role for Steve Carrell as the intellectually challenged weatherman Brick Tamlan.Overall this is a magnificent piece of popcorn fun and Ferrell proves he has the comedy chops for the big time. ****",8,2,4,16 September 2004
Hitch," For a Rom-com this is good! Not too Chick Flick!
","Another romantic comedy. Oh lordy! This is perhaps my least favourite genre with so many trite and formulaic films that all have the identical plot. While Hitch is no exception to the boy meets girl, gets girl, loses girl and regains girl, routine, it is fresh enough to be an entertaining and breezy enough way to pass some time. Also the fact it doesn't star either Sandra Bullock, J-Lo, Kate Hudson, Reece Witherspoon being chased by some middle/upper class white guy is good. It is also good that it doesn't disturbingly star the barely legal Lindsey Lohan, Olsen's, or the barely out of nappies Hilary Duff being chased by a guy clearly nearing his 30's. This star Will Smith, who falls for Eva Mendes and it is this combination that gives the film a refreshing energy. Also starring is the King of Queens himself Kevin James who adds good comedic support as the bumbling white guy to make Smith look even cooler.The film follows all the usual romantic comedy formula but thankfully has enough chemistry and funny moments to keep it watchable and it doesn't seem made purely to market a record or give the women something to watch amongst all the guy action movies. Like for example One Fine Day which I found reasonably entertaining and with a certain charm (mainly because Michelle Pfeiffer is stunningly gorgeous), this works thanks to it's two leads and some engaging side characters. Being a big Willy film and having James in a supporting role it is also a little more comedic than usual. Certainly there are some funny moments.Basically as a guys guy, these films often make me want to gag and I find myself itching to watch something else. Hitch works in the sense that it is enjoyable and likable. Another rom-com this year starring the future Mr Demi Moore, A Lot Like Love, is a film I know would get on my nerves. Overall though Hitch as a good way to pass a few hours. ***",6,1,1,8 July 2005
Vanilla Sky," What the hell? wow!!
","How could you best describe this film? I say highly surreal at times, down right weird and do you know what? it was captivating, I left the cinema screen and since that time the film has stayed in my head. It has a David Lynch and Cronenberg quality about it, in that you never really know what is supposed to be real and what isn't at certain points in the film. All the performances are great, particularly the three leads, Cruise, Cruz and Diaz and for me like many critics the sexy, gorgeous, Cameron Diaz narrowly steals the show. You really must see this film, I love the fact that it has stayed lodged in my brain as I try to work out certain parts of the film. It is really strange, but it is wonderfully shot and excellently acted. Occasionally this film seems like a music video and at other times an advert for a phone company or something, and most of the film I was left with a look of bemusement but in a good way like with films such as Fight Club or Videodrome, just two that come to mind. Where this differs from some others of this sort of confusion based film is that it gives you an answer as to what is going on at the end which you won't see coming until quite close when they hint at it, but then you still are left doubting whats happening thanks to the rest of the movie. I really like this film despite the fact it annoyed the hell out of me, but it did so with good intention unlike some movies that annoy purely because they are bad. I recommend this definately, it stretches the rules of movie making to its limits and leaves you in a daze, some may dislkie this sort of film but I like many love the effect a film like this gives you. I think the director Cameron Crowe achieved what he set out to do, leave the movie in your thoughts long after you've left the screen. This gets an 8/10 it would get a ten but the twist could be seen as perhaps a mixture of 'thats a good one' and 'yeah right!' I probably won't see it again until DVD release, I doubt it will have anywhere near the same effect as it did today.",8,0,0,1 February 2002
Blade Runner," One of the greatest movies ever!!
","The ultimate sci-fi film and pretty much one of the greatest, most visually arresting movies ever made. Blade Runner is a true cinema classic, not a box office success and not taken too well on its original release but it has since become a cult classic, critically acclaimed and in 90 percent of movies buffs top five movies. The film has spawned countless imitations of its dank futuristic world but the imagary has never been bettered, it has also created a debate that has run since it first hit the screens in 82, that debate being `is Deckard a replicant?', this has never been answered and I doubt ever will, Harrison Ford says one thing and Ridley says another. The film itself is pure brilliance, the visuals are striking, this film is certainly before its time and the special effects even now look top draw. The imagery created is exceptional with the futuristic world leaving you tongue protrudingly engrossed. As well as the visuals the plot is quite good too. Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, is a Blade Runner, a sort of cop/bounty hunter who hunts down beings known as replicants and kills them. The replicants were created to serve us but a small group in an outworld colony go bezerk and start killing humans, this means that all Replicants must be destroyed. The story has elements that obviously inspired the Terminator films and while some people call Arnie the ultimate cyborg I have to say for me Rutger Hauer is the ultimate bad guy in the artificial human category. This film launched him to cult status, he steals the show here as he has in other stand out bad guy performances in Nighthawks and the Hitcher. Hauer exudes an evil charisma in this film as the leader of a small group of murderous replicants, Roy Batty. Hauer really is chilling at times and he has an intimidating presence on screen, his lines are classic including the legendary tears in the rain speech at the end, which Hauer himself wrote. The other actors are very good, Harrison Ford is at the top of his form as Deckard and the two gorgeous ladies Daryll Hannah and Sean Young are also good. This is a must see movie, I eagerly await the re-release on DVD as my current copy is dissapointingly bereft of features. Overall I must give this 10/10",10,2,4,9 May 2002
Bruce Almighty," The return of funny Jim!!
","Jim Carrey once again teams up with his multi-times director Tom Shadyac in an attempt to strike box office gold once again after the disastrous Majestic. While this film may be pretty brainless and simplistic it is yet another top draw comedy from the rubber faced king of comedy. Jim is on fire here as Bruce who complains about god a little too much and so is endowed with Gods powers to see how he fares running the world. Jim is typically hilarious mugging his way through the film which has its fair share of riotous moments, most usually with Jim on screen.Morgan Freeman stars as God (could anyone else?) and is good and Jennifer Aniston is infectious and combines well with Jim in her first box office success. The film has the sugary ending that Liar Liar did although not quite as bad, however the rest of the film isn't quite as strong as Liar Liar. Still a cracking comedy. ***",7,0,2,18 July 2003
Casino Royale," In the top 5 Bond movies!
","Bond is finally back. Sure he's done 21 films now, but not since the heady days of Connery at his peak, have the Bond films excelled, and been beyond cartoony gadgets, outlandish set pieces, and cheesy double entendres. Now all those elements have always been part and parcel of the Bond series, but as the series has progressed through the Roger Moore period, it's been less about the stories and the character of JB himself. A few have been different to varying degree's of success, such as the not so popular Dalton entries, to the most recent decent Bond, Goldeneye. However CR succeeds in bringing Bond down to earth a bit more and inviting us to delve into his character a bit more.Goldeneye helmer Martin Campbell returns once more, with success again. Not only does he have an edgier script to work with, he's allowed to put his stamp on some outstanding action scenes too. The action feels necessary and part of the story, not merely an excuse to do something outlandish for the sake of it, such as the hideously gimmicky Thames set action in The World Is Not Enough, or just about everything in the near Moonraker cheesefest, Die Another Day. Here the action fits into the story, and excels without feeling gimmicky. Indeed CR features some of the most jaw dropping set pieces put to film including a superb free-running chase, and a car chase on an airport runway. Aside from anything else, it's all captured with some flair, sadly lacking from the flat direction of the last two Bond films especially.The main question of course, is about the validity of Daniel Craig as the latest 007. Many were sceptical, questioning the blonde hair, the height, the looks, amongst other things. Plus the worries that Bond would become too po-faced and serious like Dalton. In truth Daniel Craig is most like Timothy Dalton if comparing to the Bond actors canon. But he's got the material to make an edgier Bond work, which Dalton didn't have in the far too Americanised films he did. Craig is a far more serious Bond, playing him on his first proper assignment. However Craig is allowed to express some Conneryesque charm too. And when the action kicks in, he holds his own, performing most of his own stunts. Without doubt Craig is a worthy Bond. Similarly Eva Green represents one of the best Bond girl's in years. A near unknown, she works in her role where the previous three Bond girls (the rather pointlessly sassy Halle Berry in particular). Green is also extremely attractive and with the kind of European look that evokes the Bond girls of yesteryear. Bond villains too have become quite lame in recent times, yet Mads Mikkelsen is excellent and has a real intensity as Le Chiffre.The film isn't merely a lazily and sloppily produced effort (or lack of) that the producers have been guilty of in previous years. This is brilliantly shot and cut, and the cinematography is eye-catching and atmospheric, not flat and DP 101 like the last film. Elsewhere David Arnold makes up for his overwrought last few Bond scores with a more low key and effective one here, although his and Chris Cornell's theme isn't great (then again anything beats Madges Die Another Day). The only negatives really are a somewhat segmented feeling in the plot, and the very lengthy running time, but these are minor quibbles in a top class Bond outing.Overall this is a great action film that has taken a leaf from the Bourne books, and kept things grounded, and remembered the plot. It's every bit as good as those movies, and ranks in the top 5 Bond movies. ****1/2",10,3,6,16 November 2006
Speed," An action classic!!
","This is one of the best action movies of the 90's, and certainly of its year of release in 94. The action is fantastic and the movie is a tense thrill ride from start to finish. Jan De Bont shows great flair and confidence in his directorial debut and has failed to come anywhere near the standard set here in his movies since. Aside from some fantastic set pieces with top draw effects and pyrotechnics, not to mention insane stunts, the movies pace is superb, it barely stops for breath and this helps to really stretch out the basic premise, similar to the way Die Hard stretched out a simplistic idea. The cast are good, Reeves makes a great action man and performs a lot of his own stunts, which add to the quality, while he does the stoic action role well leaving the acting to the endearing Sandra Bullock and the scene chewing Dennis Hopper, with good support from Jeff Daniels and Joe Morton. Still grade A action. ****",8,1,2,23 July 2004
X2: X-Men United," Exceeds your expectations tenfold!!!
","This movie rocks big time! Where the first was just an appetizer and an introduction to some interesting characters, this movie adds more layers but also blows you away with the sheer scale and excitement. Now I liked the first movie but it wasn't a top draw movie, it was just a good movie, between 3 and 4 out of 5. This is a solid 4 and a bit more.
The strengths of the first film are all evident again, but are significantly more increased. The supporting characters and bad guys are a lot better (with no offence to Sabretooth but complete offence to Toad) and the X-Men have even more interest with their characters. The action was good in the first but nothing that slapped your face and choke slammed you hard to your cinema seat like in this. The opening action scene in the Whitehouse is exceptional as is the fighter plane chase as well, and the face off between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike is also very exciting.Basically this has really launched the franchise as a tent pole film for the summer. I eagerly await X3. This film is very interesting with a real shock at the end, and the development of some character relationships is also equally interesting, such as Jean and Wolverine and Iceman and Rogue. Pretty much all the roles are better than they were in the first, including Mystique, Pyro, Iceman and most definitely the more central characters like Storm, Jean, Wolverine and also Xavier. Rogue was reduced but not to a massive degree.Yet again Ian Mckellen is on scene stealing form as Magneto. Hugh Jackman exudes toughness and charisma and comes a close second to Sir Ian and then the rest are all fantastic, worthy of mention are Brian Cox, Patrick Stewart (of course) Shawn Ashmore as Iceman and the sexy ladies Halle Berry, a significantly improved role for Rebbeca Romjin-Stamos and the gorgeous Famke Janssen.The effects and action are astounding; the only problem being that the end doesn't quite live up to the fantastic opening of the film. Wolverines action scenes are much better and his blades are used a lot more. All the action in this is great there are no flat scenes. Overall this must go down as one of the best comic book movies, dare I say it better than Spidey last year. This certainly goes down as a personal favourite, and is well worth a repeat view. This film has set a great benchmark for this year's host of blockbusters. ****1/2",9,0,0,14 May 2003
The Sixth Sense," Shyamalan as set the bar for his future films very high!
","M Night Shyamalan's rise to prominence came after this superb chiller. The plot is very good and the movie is masterfully directed. For a young up and comer, M Night showed a remarkably sure hand and create tension. This film is masterfully shot. Waht makes this film however is the superb cast, Bruce Willis is good, as is Toni Collette as the mother of troubled young boy Cole, who sees dead people. Haley Joel Osment as Cole is a revelation and gives one of the greatest child performances ever, he should have got an Oscar for this for sure, his performance is truly awe inspiring it leaves the audience amazed at how this kid can engross you, the way he is immersed into his role is a way in which only Hollywoods elite like De Niro and Pacino etc can do and at only 11 years of age when filming this it is amazing. He will develop to be one of Hollywoods best on the evidence of this. *****",10,0,0,23 July 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The greatest movie ever made! Rounding off a perfect trilogy!
","The final instalment in what has been the greatest cinematic feat that I can imagine. How Peter Jackson could have taken the reigns of such a titanic beast of three movies, of the same story, is beyond me. The sheer scale is flabbergasting. We have been enthralled since the Fellowship commenced their quest 2 years ago. It's so sad now that this has ended. The films of Tolkien's marvellous fable have given Christmas a new excitement for many who had lost any excitement over the Christmas period, that's certainly how I felt. For three years however LOTR has been an event for me and my family and friends. I love the LOTR. I love everything the film stands for, everything about these films. I love the way they combine the best of old fashioned skill and labour to build all the sets and every aspect of the mise en-scene. I love the fact that for the year of the photography of this movie, Hobbiton was built, and Theodon's town was built, and Gondors stronghold was built. I love the fact that this film is a labour of love, and that it shows. I love the fact that CGI is used alongside these old fashioned techniques and the scale of the film isn't entirely down to a computer like the Star wars prequels are. This is 300million dollars of blood and sweat on the screen, filmed lovingly and created lovingly by all involved, none more so than Peter Jackson, who has to get an academy award for this instalment, having missed out unfairly for the last two.ROTK Is my favourite part, followed by the Fellowship, I just loved the beginning segment, but the final third is so amazing, it genuinely feels that as an audience member you have been on a really massive journey. It feels far more than the 9 and a half hours it has all been, It feels like we have been on a 3 year journey. This closing of the saga is jaw dropping, engrossing stuff. Everything that made the first 2 movies excellent is once again evident, but like Two Towers was compared to the first, there is a massive jump in scale. The scale of this movie, from the sets, to the effects is so huge it's scary at times, and Peter Jackson is an amazing director to have harnessed all of this together. It goes beyond my imagination to think how someone could direct all of this.The cast once again are first rate, but this movie belongs to Viggo Mortenson and Sean Astin, who should both get Oscar nominations. All the actors involved have peaked with these movies, because they have on the most part risen to a level no one would have guessed of them before these movies. Viggo is a good example. He has never been a leading man, sad as it is because I have always thought he was a good actor, I only thought he was good though before this. Now I see him as an excellent actor and a leading man. LOTR is by far and away his finest work and his finest performances and he has now taken his place in the A-list. Sean Astin also really surprised me, he stepped it up to a level no one would have guessed, particularly in ROTK when his character is integral to the plot and he gets far more focus and depth and he rises to the challenge. The audience really feel endeared to Sam and that is down to Astin. Viggo Mortenson was great in the first two and became a lead in the Two Towers, and once again he is a lead in this one, but this is the most important movie in Aragon's saga and Mortenson is outstanding. He makes for a great action man, because he looks tough, he performs most of his own stunts but feels more like a true hero, which is what LOTR is all about, real heroes, true courage, the epitomy of which is the four Hobbits. Like I said Astin is excellent and steals the movie jointly with Viggo, but the other Hobbits are excellent and there are larger roles for Merry and Pippin played excellently by Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan. Billy Boyd is superb in this. The rest of the cast are all great. There's not one bad performance. Ian Mckellen is excellent as Gandalf but we already knew he was top class. Also more outstanding work from, Bernard Hill, John Rhys-Davies, Orlando Bloom, Elijah Wood, Miranda Otto, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving, Karl Urban, John Noble, Andy Serkis, and David Wenhem. Absolutely fantastic cast full of moving performances.The action of the film is amazing. Massive battles that dwarf the previous films and also thrilling scenes with the Hobbits, including Frodo's encounter with the Shelob, a giant Spider intent on eating him. It's really just pure excitement and tension throughout, the tension of the battles, the tension that comes from Gollum's presence around Frodo and Sam. The Orc invasion of Gondor is amazing, particularly when the giant Elephants come into play.The film also has the best score of the three, it is sweeping and massive and epic. Even more so than the first two. The key to this film is the likeable characters, who all seem real, all human with emotion and weakness but they still drive forward to help others and this film is really about what courage is. Courage isn't about Schwarzenegger taking on an army single handed, it's four little Hobbits out of their depth, in the face of real adversity who show real courage to carry on when all hope is lost. Real courage is about the tens of thousands of men who follow their leaders into battle knowing the are fighting a battle they have little chance of winning. That's why we love these people and this story, it touches everyone in some way, from people who have been in real life war situations feeling how the Hobbits felt, to people respecting the bravery these Hobbits show.All in all it saddens me to be commenting on the final LOTR movie, I'll keep my fingers crossed for The Hobbit by Peter Jackson, but I get the feeling there will never be a series of movies like these again with such passion in them and such an epic scope, and such a fantastic group of characters. I hope to see a couple of re-launched careers going where they obviously should be, on the up. Particularly Viggo Mortenson, it's about time he had some more leading roles, and some juicier roles like this was. Also Sean Astin, who I only remember from films like The Goonies and California Man. I also expect good things from Elijah Wood as well. Things have already gone excellently for Orlando Bloom, who is the hottest property in Hollywood at the moment. Anyway, well done Mr Jackson, we all salute you! *****",10,0,0,21 December 2003
The Matrix," Groundbreaking, brilliant, best film ever!!
","I have to say that the Matrix goes down as one of my favourite films ever. The film is pure excellence in film making. There are so many levels to interprit this film, it is an action sci-fi firstly, with an excellent storyline but in the two hours or so of running time if you read between the lines the film offers so many philosophical and religious undertones its frightening, I can watch this film many times and not get bored because you always pick up something new if you look close enough. I realised a few references in the film for instance Keanu Reeves as a messiah figure.The script, aside from the undertones, is exceptional. The story is excellently drafted out and there are great twists. Also the Wachowski brothers direct the film with such style it is simply amazing. The film at times comes across like a manga cartoon and you can tell that these guys are fans of the Japanese cartoons when you see the lighting and angles etc that are used occasionally. They really have created a tense and eerie visual delight. The musical score also adds to the impressive visuals.Of course the big selling point of the Matrix to most are the groundbreaking effects, from the creation of bullet time to the excellent wire work and computer generated effects such as the chilling scenes as Neo awakens in the real world. Despite all these technical flourishes that will drop jaws I did not feel that the special effects were the best thing of the movie. For me it was the way the story pans out and the pacing of the movie as well as the amazing cinematography that create a dark manga styled world.The cast are all good, Keanu Reeves is a little on the stoic side but his character is suited to that trait, other than a slightly wooden exterior, Reeves is good through the whole movie and impresses in the stunning action sequences. Carrie Ann Moss is very good and very sexy, clad throughout most of the film in tight leather, she kicks rear with grace and beauty. Also good is an impressive Hugo Weaving and the show stealer, Larry Fishbourne as Morpheus.To the action sequences now, and for action junkies these scenes will live long in the memory. The kung-fu fights are shot brilliantly and the choreography is some of the best non hong kong ever put to screen bar Drive. The four principal actors do the fights themselves despite not knowing any martial arts and the fights also include excellent back breaking stunts and wire work as well as some visual effects. For me though the best action sequence was the lobby shoot out which is one of the best gun fights ever to grace the big screen, the destructive brilliance of the scene was amazing as Reeves and Moss take out a group of security gaurds while rubble is flying through the air. The scene is definately a mild ode to master John Woo, who the Wachowskis are fans of. The end battle is not a let down either.I would have to say that the film starts off really superbly, more as a tense thriller than action orientated, although there is still action. The atmosphere built up is tense and the film really draws you in. After Neo has met morpheous and goes to the real world, discovering what the Matrix is, the film kind of lost something for me, but still even then is a ten out of ten flick, and of course that is where the kung-fu and effects really kick in and the action builds up. I feel this film is so good that the sequels will be mild let downs especially with the direction the story must take after this films ending. Until the second film can be judged I will watch this when I feel like it and leave you by simply adding 10/10",Null,0,0,11 March 2002
Heat," Classic! Why no Oscar nominations for Al and Bob?
","One of the finest crime thrillers of the last ten years. Heat boasts an all star cast, some exceptional cinematography, sound and acting. The film has gone for realism in the action department and what you get is some brilliant action sequences, there's no diving through the air in slow motion with doves appearing from nowhere, its more involving on a realism level like Saving Private Ryan was to war movies. The post bank heist shootout is outstanding.The plot is based around Pacino's character Vincent, a cop and Neil played by Bob De Niro, who is a criminal genius. Both are similar in that their careers are their life. They feel isolated because of the dedication required to being the best of the breed in their chosen profession. Neil and his team want to pull off one last big heist and Pacino's character wants to stop him. Simple. The scripts excellence is that this is an exceptional character movie. The film has so many interestingly written and well played supporting characters, combining with the lead characters.
The film has flawless acting from everyone. Pacino and De Niro are both on Oscar worthy form with neither quite managing to steal the others thunder. Val Kilmer has rarely been as watchable and Tom Sizemore is also in great form as was Kevin Gage as Waingro. Diane Venora is very good as Pacino's long suffering third wife. Also Amy Brenneman as De Niro's love interest is very good. There are some great scenes in this movie. De Niro and Pacino sharing the screen for the first time in the cafe scene was legendary, it is one of my favourite scenes in a movie ever, and the end was touching. The last scene between Val Kilmer and his wife was good as was the parting of Neil and Eedy. Also Natalie Portman followed her brilliant performance in Leon with another great showing here.Overall this is a movie that has classic written all over it. The most interesting supporting cast ever and also excellence in direction, acting and the music. This film should have had more Oscar recognition. Pacino and De Niro are both worthy of Oscar nominations but there wasn't really enough room for both of them and you couldn't nominate one and not the other. This is one of my favourite movies ever, at nearly 3 hours it never bores and holds your attention from minute one to the thrilling climax. It is a tale of obsession, solitude and mutual respect. Excellence in film making. 10/10",10,1,2,6 September 2002
Cube," Cult Classic Sci-Fi!!
","SPOILER: Vincenzo Natali. Funny sounding name right? Well just a little funny. Keep that name in your mind though over the next few years. After this film the Cube, Natali's follow up was the superb Cypher. He seems to be a master of a difficult genre, Sci-Fi. In a genre that is primarily known for having a high pap ratio, the fact that Natali's first two features have been cult classic science fiction movies then bodes well for Sci-fi fanatics who will eagerly anticipate his next movie. The Cube is a superbly crafted low budget film. On a shoestring budget and a dangerously basic premise full of intrigue, the film succeeds because of imaginative effects and taut directions as well as a superbly written script, delving into the human psyche in such an extreme situation. The plot is basically thus: A group of strangers wake in a cube room. They don't know where they are or how they got there but they know they must find a way out. It also transpires that when they leave each room the enter another room that is virtually identical in look. There will perhaps be a different colour in the lighting. The must find their way out before they starve tp death or go nuts, but to add to their woes, it seems that some of the rooms are booby trapped, ranging from sound activated, to pressure activated traps. They soon discover that each of them has a specific gift that can perhaps hold the key to their escape. There is a maths genius who may hold the key to discovering a way out. The rooms are numbered and the numbers could signify the type of room but also a map. The film is excellent and just when they think they have figured it out the Cube bites them in the behind. The dynamic of the characters is excellent as inevitably some go crazy. I do think that for a film shot for less than 300,000 dollars this is amazing looking. It works well for a film that is set in the same environment for the 90 minutes of the film. I have to say this film is one of those pleasant surprises that comes from nowhere and when word of mouth finally gets to you, please listen! ****",10,102,136,22 June 2004
Sin City," What A City!
","I was really looking forward to this film. I couldn't wait. Then with all the hoo-hah of Star Wars I kind of forgot about Frank Millar's graphic novel adaptation. However I made a point of seeing it as soon as it hit UK cinemas and I must say this film kicked me in the nuts and reminded me just how much I was anticipating it. I love a nice dark film and Sin City is dark. It doesn't hold back with it's subject matter, that while lurid, and a tad misogynistic it makes for a great lads movie. Speaking of the violence; this film is incredibly violent but comically so, both in the humour and the comic book style. You very rarely see red blood, much like the slaughter scene in kill bill when it went black and white. Sin City is shot in almost entirely black and white with colour flourishes every now and again, maybe for the body work of a car say. Those complaining of the level of violence should remember that this is a comic book style film. Those who love, or would love Millar's graphic novels would love this. Robert Rodriguez has put in every snapshot from the books, every piece of narration and every line of dialogue. It is the most accurate translation of book to screen. This is why Rodriguez gave Millar co-directing credit.There are three main stories in Sin City. One involves a character Marv, hunting the killers of his only love and trying to clear himself of the crime. He uncovers a deep chain of thugs leading to a Cardinal and his young cannibal friend Kevin. Then there is Hartigan, who we see in two time spans. The first sees him rescue a young girl from the clutches of Roark junior, the son of a senator and nephew of a cardinal. He is something of a lover of young children in the Gary Glitter sense, and has his eyes on 11 year old Nancy. Hartigan rescues her though and leaves junior in a state of near death, with his hand and his pecker blown off! Hartigan is betrayed as well by his partner and left for dead. However he is saved and kept alive by senator Roark who wants Hartigan to be sent down for raping Nancy and for what he did to junior. Hartigan goes to prison and will stay there until he signs a confession to this crimes, the allegations of abusing Nancy of course being false. Each day too Nancy writes to him under a false name, as she now lives outside the radar so the Roark's won't find her and finish the job. Hartigan after 8 years of weekly letters, doesn't receive one, and gets a visit form a now deformed Junior. He now knows Nancy is in danger so signs the confession to get out and get to her before junior. Unfortunately as it turns out he was tricked into leading junior straight to Nancy. So now we must have bloody face-off number two between Hartigan and Junior. Finally we have Dwight who meets his new girlfriends abusive ex. He takes it upon himself to warn Jackie Boy away but when Jackie Boy leaves, Dwight realises that he may hurt another woman, maybe kill her. Jackie Boy and is goons end up in old town which is now run by domina, leather clad hookers, and is part of a shaky truce between the police and the gangsters. These chicks are tough but they wouldn't be able to handle all out turf war. So when Jackie Boy causes trouble and ends up being killed by the silent prostitute assassin Miho, and turns out to be a cop, these girls have trouble. They now have to cover their tracks and bury the body in tar-pits. Otherwise all out gang war will be set upon old town.This film has great dialogue, whether in someone's head or coming out their mouths. This has plenty of cracking one-liners as well. What really makes this a good film is that it is so unique. The look of it and the style is almost the stuff of cinematic history. Rodriguez has really raised his game from being a good director to doing a film his buddy Tarantino would lovingly emblazon onto his CV. The cast is fantastic. The three leads Bruce Willis, Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke are superb and Rourke in particular kicks it out of the park. Not only is this a great return to the big leagues for Rourke but this is probably his best performance. Bruce Willis is similarly excellent with his best work in years. Clive Owen also does a superb job as Dwight. Elsewhere all the Roark's are suitably slimy and turgid thanks to excellent turns from Rutger Hauer, Powers Booth and a particularly grotesque Nick Stahl. All the rest of the cast and in particular the gorgeous ladies are superb. There are no weaknesses. The film's music is also very good with three composers seamlessly gelling to a coherent style. The film really does look great though. It could end up being the best looking film of the year, certainly the most original looking. I love the black and white and the intrusions of colour. While the blue screen method works far better than Sky Captain which at times felt flat with lots of still shots and people running from one part of the screen to the other. Rodriguez's direction is typically frenetic. So far I would say that Sin City manages to dish out a sneaky shot to Lucas' nuts from behind and is the film of the year so far, ahead of Star Wars the third. To sum up this film in one word; COOL! *****",9,3,5,6 June 2005
Gangs of New York," Top Quality movie making!
","This is a wonderfully lavish spectacle from maestro Martin Scorsese. The film, despite being a little overblown and overly melodramatic, is still a fantastic example of how to make a movie.The film of course will be most remembered for the return of Daniel Day Lewis after 5 years out of the business and after watching it he will definitely be the lasting memory. Lewis is fantastic, he steals every scene and if he wins his Oscar its deserved. The rest of the cast are good but play second fiddle to be honest. Leonardo Di Caprio proves once again that he can act and isn't just eye candy for young females, and Cameron Diaz proves that for herself in regards of the male viewers, in fact she looks remarkably different donning a mane of curly red hair and without make up and proves that it isn't the slap (make-up) that makes her pretty, she is naturally gorgeous. Also good are Brendon Gleeson and Jim Broadbent, as ever.Overall this is not Scorseses best, in fact truthfully it is one of his worst, but that siad this is still top draw stuff with fantastic production desgin, great music and stuning performances from namely mr Day Lewis in particular. As you expect from Scorsese this is very violent and bloody but its engaging stuff. ****",9,0,1,17 February 2003
Donnie Darko," One of the best films of recent years!
","Donnie Darko: This superb low budget gem is an engrossing and strange tale of a troubled young man named Donnie. He is troubled by visions, in particular of a figure in a rabbit suit named Frank. Frank tells Donnie to do certain things, from flooding his school to burning someone's house down.The story essentially starts a while after Donnie's psychological problems. When we first see him he is already on medication and has a psychiatrist. The story confuses, but for this sort of film it is confusion in a good way, much like David Lynch's films. As the story progresses we become more intrigued by who Frank is and what will happen. When he first contacts Donnie he tells him the world will end in 12 days. The film has a great ending that really grabs you a leaves a lasting impression. I enjoyed the film immensely especially as it is something different from the usual films released.The cast are very good. Jake Gyllenhaal perfectly portrays the tortured teen Donnie, and his sister Maggie plays Donnie's sister in the movie too. This gives a realism to the brother sister dynamic, and not to mention she is a good actress as well. There is also good support from Jena Malone and also Patrick Swayze and Drew Barrymore.Overall a Lynch styled thriller that is always intriguing and watchable. *****",9,0,2,22 June 2004
Back to the Future," Fantastically scripted sci-fi comedy!!
","Extremely enjoyable family movie. It is a classic time travel story and this film is the best of the series. Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd are both fantastic and they get good support from Lea Thompson, James Tolkan and a hilarious Thomas F Wilson as Biff. This is charming fantasy fun with great time and effort gone into creating the different time periods. It's a fantastically engaging story. What marks this above many other time-travel films is the superb script. The little touches throughout are superb and this truly is a film you can watch over again many times over and pick up new things you didn't notice before. The film also has a fantastic soundtrack. *****",10,1,2,23 July 2004
The Bourne Supremacy," Supreme!!!
","The sequel to surprise hit The Bourne Identity is a superb accomplishment and is even better than the first film. This is a superbly intelligent and polished thriller and like the first film harks back to great espionage films from the 60's. It's delightfully reminiscent of classic films like The Ipcress File. The story this time has Bourne hiding away in Goa with his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente.) He is found by a German spook (Karl Urban) and is on the receiving end of an assassination attempt, Bourne survives and Marie does not. The idea is to finally kill Bourne and then frame him for the killing of CIA agents after a botched deal, headed by Pamela Landy (Joan Allen.). Bourne now wants revenge and goes to Berlin to find out what happened he wants to face the Feds head on. The story naturally is full of double crossing and intrigue as any good spy thriller should have and it all unravels nicely. This story develops Bourne's character even further and the impact of Marie's death has great dramatic affect throughout the film as Bourne also begins to have memories of a mission he did in Berlin that holds importance to events happening now.Like the first installment, Matt Damon is excellent. He perfectly balances the inner fragility with the outer sternness and composure of Bourne's secret agent personality. Also as before Brian Cox is superb and his dodgy dealings come full circle. Karl Urban who is an up and comer thanks to his appearance in Lord Of The Rings 2 and 3 is also very good and has a presence in the film similar to Clive Owen in the first. Joan Allen is also very good and I have to say looking sexier than ever!The action in this film is pulsating. It's documentary like and puts you right in the action and the centre piece car chase is the action scene of the year, no question. The fact that all the car chases are reality based is something I love about this and indeed the first film. In amongst all the over the top, surrealistic action sequences in blockbusters (which I like in their own way) this is a refreshingly exciting collection of action scenes that feel realistic, there are no 100 ft high explosions or cars that hurtle 50ft through the air. It's crunching, superbly choreographed stunt work, real crashes, real physics and real carnage. Much like the superlative car chases in Ronin the chases here are amazing.Overall this is a great thriller narrowly beating out the first film. It's great to have an action film with character, acting, an intelligent script and also with genuine tension and atmosphere. Not to be missed. ****½",9,2,3,1 November 2004
V for Vendetta," Brilliant movie, far better than the Matrix sequels!!
","The science fiction genre is very much a mixed bag. The success rate is minimal and generally the mega budgeted films fall flat and lifeless. V For Vendetta however falls under the mid budget range category and as such it's not a bloated attempt at marketable science fiction excess. This isn't like Bays shallow film The Island, or the disappointingly tame vision from Alex Proyas in I Robot, whose previous science fiction film was the moderately budgeted and superb Dark City. Essentially the producer pressure of these over-hyped and overpriced rip-offs don't have the love and attention given to films not green=lit with hundreds of millions. For example the first Matrix film, the most influential of it's genre since Terminator 2 (a rare hundred mill plus success!) was infinitely more engrossing than it's lifeless sequels. With endless resources at hand and the ability to go extreme, the Wachowski's two sequels attempted to cram our heads with philosophy and religious connotation that was more subtly fed to the audience in the original. The films survived only by the impressive effects and huge action scenes, and that goes for other similarly gigantic sci-fi epics. The films shot under that 100 mill bracket show more ingenuity and more heart, and mostly more originality. Even right down to ultra low budget there have been great films, like Cube, far more enjoyably thought provoking than the now boring Matrix sequels that completely lack the original films repeat value.V For Vendetta is an immensely enjoyable experience. It is completely immersing and engrossing. The Orwellian plot, with the idea of a society led to be a utopia is as usual really a dystopian nightmare. In respect of the plot, influenced by the Guy Fawkes plot, we have seen this kind of story before, in movies and mostly in literature, and it's very similar to 1984. However this film feels so fresh, and as I watched it I felt I was watching something new, different, despite a recognised storyline. The film though, written by the Wachowski's has the depth instilled in their other films thus far. However this time V for Vendetta doesn't attempt to dully cram in existentialism into the gullets of its audience as in the Matrix sequels, rather it's depth is subtle and nicely delivered and will no doubt lead to great discussions on internet forums. This film will grow and grow and become a Sci-Fi classic like The Matrix.The film is brilliantly directed by James McTeigue making his directorial debut, previously being an assistant to the Wachowski's and also George Lucas. Now there will no doubt be conspiracy theorists claiming Larry and Andy were in fact pulling the strings here, in their roles as producers and writers, but clearly, while showing some consistent style with the Matrix films, this is stylistically different enough to suggest Mcteigue is responsible for the most enjoyable Science Fiction film since Spielberg's Minority Report. He will be a name to watch no question. The film looks great that's for sure. The complementary relationship between visuals and script are first rate. Also while the trailers may have suggested this would be an effects heavy film worthy of the Wachowski's name, they were misleading. This is not a CG laden movie, there is comparatively little CGI to most modern flicks of the action/ sci-fi genre. Similarly the film has fight scenes but not the balletic martial arts of the Matrix films. There are marital arts but we get up close and personal, rough and ready. This is meant to look ugly not graceful. Also on another technical standpoint the production design is fantastic for this British and particularly, London set film. The musical score is also fresh and original sounding one of the most interesting scores I have heard for some time, from Dario Marianelli.The cast are excellent, made up of a plethora of excellent British actors like the chilling John Hurt, and also good turns from Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry and Rupert Graves. The leads though are firstly Natalie Portman who is mesmerising as Evie. Not only due to her astounding beauty but a rich performance only marred by the odd slip on her near faultless London accent. She puts completely to dark her subdued turns in the Star Wars flicks and once again proves what an exceptional young actress she is (One Oscar nom already and will surely be adding more in the near future). Hugo Weaving stars too as the physical and vocal actor portraying V. In a role where he does not show his face at all, and wears a solid and inexpressive white mask, Weaving exudes gravitas, giving an impossibly rich and ambiguous performance for a rich and ambiguous character. V is at once a character to sympathise with and be unsympathetic to. He is at once a hero, a freedom fighter, a rebel, an anarchist and a terrorist. He's a walking contradiction but it makes his character incredibly intriguing. Indeed the fact we never really get close to his character or learn too much may annoy some people, but it added to the film for me and I feel will only create discussion, and theorising amongst buffs. The film indeed leaves questions left needing answers. It teases us and then holds back, and before you know it the credits are rolling. The sense of mystery will be discussed no doubt.Overall this was a very enjoyable piece, bar for some pacing issues with some side plots, but still an engrossing film nonetheless. This will be a cult classic I'm sure and deservedly so. ****1/2",9,2,4,21 March 2006
