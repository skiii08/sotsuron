Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," This movie was terribly offensive.
","This whole movie was terribly offensive to Jews, Kazahks, Christians, Southerners, Cowboys, Americans, etc..In this day and age I'm surprised that all the official movie reviews didn't hammer him for that.There's not much more to say, this movie is disturbing. When I go to a comedy I want to laugh and have a good feeling: bigotry and racism are not funny.I have laughed at many 'stupid' movies: old school, dude where's my car, dumb 'n dumber, etc. This movie is not like that he his cruel to the people he is suppose to me making fun of, not funny.I am not a Kazakh, nor have I ever been there, but I could see why they are not happy. Search the Internet about Kazakhstan, it looks like a very beautiful country.",1,29,59,10 November 2006
Here Comes the Boom," Funny and funny...
","My wife and kids didn't stop laughing the whole time. My belly hurts from too much laughing. What is there to say? Kevin James and his slapstick,the Fonz, Danny from the King of Queens. No Boston accent, but who cares? Cheeky at times, but who cares.If you are worried about taking your kids to see something about MMA, don't worry the fight scenes are appropriate and fake enough.It is a lighter Kevin James so that might disappoint some fans. The Fonz shows he is actually a very good actor. What to say, its make believe, but a funny make believe. You will either be roll over laughing or not get it, so if you are one of those who won't get it, you won't appreciate it.",10,8,15,12 October 2012
