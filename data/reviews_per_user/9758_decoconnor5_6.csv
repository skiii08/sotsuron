Requiem for a Dream," Just try and forget this film
","This film was recommended to me by a friend. I had seen Leto before in American Psycho, Burstyn in The Exorcist and Wayans in numerous comedies. This was a fantastic film and if you plan on watching it prepared to be shocked. This film goes far beyond the effects of drug use. This film examines severe personal meltdown. Having watched it I genuinely didn't know if I wanted more or if I had actually seen enough. During the film I felt pain, sadness anger but also sheer delight. This is by all means a shocking film to watch but its done so well that you cant not call it brilliant. The development of characters (Burstyns in particular), the chilling music, the complete relevance this film has on society today are all factors in what make this film one of the best. I would consider it a must see. It will shock you and move you but you will feel better for seeing it. Before my friend lent me the film I asked what made it so good? He simply said 'because you wont be able to forget it'.",10,0,1,7 March 2010
Shutter Island," Scorsese's new venture keeps you guessing until the very end and long after that too.
","I gave this 10 out of 10 because I genuinely thought it was an excellent film. I had seen the trailers and read the reviews, something many film fans avoid in the fear of over expectation. When seeing the trailer I seen clips of scenes that came across as almost ghostly and supernatural. This threw me a little as I have become used to Scorsese's type of film and never have I seen him use ghosts or any supernatural element. Trust me when I say, DO NOT LET THIS THROW YOU! If you want to see a type of film like Casino, Goodfellas or Gangs of NY just go rent them because this is nothing like those films. This is something completely different. This is a new side to Scorsese that hasn't been seen before. For a Director of his reputation this was a big risk to take but it really did pay off. Di Caprio is simply brilliant here and plays his role to perfection. The supporting cast all do a fine job and in particular Ben Kingsley who is excellent. Fantastic performances, excellent direction with great use of flashback and overall a storyline that will keep you thinking 'what if?' until well after you leave the theater. Don't be put off by Scorses's new direction. It works unbelievably well and you wont be disappointed. Without giving anything away I recommend that you go watch Shutter Island. Having seen it, I still wonder if what we actually saw was what really happened? Highly Recommended",10,1,5,14 March 2010
American History X," Powerful
","I seen this film a few years ago and while i enjoyed it I didn't appreciate it as much. I watched it again recently and I was blown away by what I saw, shocked even. The story itself is so relevant and honest that it hits you hard on so many levels. Its disturbing to realise that there is such hatred in the world. Norton delivers a career defining performance as does Furlong. The rest of the cast are all solid and altogether deliver a powerful piece of cinema. At times throughout the film I had to say to myself did that really happen, is such brutality real? But beyond the violence lies a problem that has been looked at one thousand different times and we still haven't found an answer. Perhaps there never will be an answer, but what we are shown in this film doesn't need an answer, it just needs to be witnessed to be believed. A masterpiece.",10,0,2,22 January 2010
Into the Wild," An amazing film - one of the best.
","This was one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. It changed my outlook completely and it helped me to appreciate the most simple things in life. I first became interested in this film because I heard that Emile Hirsch was cast and I am a huge fan of his work. I believe he's an excellent actor and I can see his career going from strength to strength. I then began to learn about the true story of Christopher McCandless and his life. I have read articles from those that knew him and from what I have read Sean Penn has portrayed this young mans life down to a tee. The acting, filming, scenery and Eddie Vedders fantastic soundtrack are all amazing but the story itself is what does it. A mans strict refusal to be lured in by the evil in society leads to an epic journey of Self Development, proving that real strength lies within. This film will not only entertain, it will inspire. It shows that the only thing stopping you, is you.A Masterpiece.",10,3,6,11 December 2009
50_50," This is as Real as it gets
","This is a fantastic film. JGL continues to develop as a actor and having seen him in Hesher and now this I am convinced that he will soon be one of the most sought after names in film. I was also very impressed with Seth Rogen here. He plays the broken but brave best friend to perfection, never willing to let his friend believe that its over but secretly knowing that this could well be it. It takes you on the emotional journey of the sufferer and his immediate circle of family and friends. It highlights the high points which are uplifting and the low points which are heartbreaking. It grabs hold of you and gives you an indication of what cancer is like, how it affects you and how it can damn well destroy you if you let it. But it also teaches you to never give up. This makes you feel which is what a great film should do.This is as real as it gets.",10,2,4,17 March 2012
Up in the Air," New found respect for Clooney
","I think that this may well be Clooneys best performance to date. I didn't know a lot about the film before i went to see it, only what the adverts were giving. The story itself is very powerful and direct. It will pull audiences in and not let go. Clooney was given the perfect role and in return he delivered the perfect performance. The supporting cast all gave solid performances and their were some fantastic cameos from some very well known actors, one in particular from the man that made the Hangover so enjoyable! The story was so relevant and I think it will succeed due to its brutal honesty. Given the current global recession the writers saw an opportunity to really get inside the viewers heads. This film will have an effect on many people as it did to me. George Clooney was at his best and gave an amazing performance and in doing so allowed us to approach a topic that many people find to uncomfortable to talk about. A powerful piece of cinema.",9,1,3,22 January 2010
