Skyfall," Bond for Sale!
","Now far be if from me to judge how the owners of a franchise - beloved or not - handle their product, however I am entitled to right to my own opinion. If you disagree, fine. I respect your right to.We open with the can of worms that is product placement. While it was always somewhat present in the Bond films, it has never been so blatant or counter-Bond as it has become, especially in Skyfall. James Bond drinking beer? Driving a Mercedes? Using a freaking Sony Vaio and Xperia S (some of the worst junk in tech today bears the name Sony). I have never cringed so hard while watching a beloved movie character whose mystique was built over 50 years be sold off to the highest bidder. No self respecting government agency would use Sony Vaio laptops (did anyone else notice the wobbly-to-hell screen when Bond tapped it with 'that's the guy'). No secret agent would likely have a smartphone or iPhone without an OS that has the proper encryption. Bond would not shill for Heineken - a beer that is sold to the US by Holland which Dutch people will not drink because it is really that awful in comparison to European beer. Bond once represented that which is refined - Vodka Martinis, Fine automobiles, a knowledge of Champagnes and Wines, Art and History, and even Science and technology. Now he really has been transformed into a skilled thug with a club. While I like Daniel Craig in the role of secret agent, he never has been 'Bond' and may never be. If things continue as they have, we might see him drive a Lexus, eat at Dominos Pizza or a street hot dog cart, and shotgun Jager with... well the women are still beautiful. At least that hasn't changed.To borrow from the a prominent clich√© in the film: It's a brave new world. It's Bond to the highest bidder.",8,0,5,10 November 2012
