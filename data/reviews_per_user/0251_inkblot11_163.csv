The Rock," Outstanding action movie, with great turns by Connery, Cage, and Harris
","Near San Francisco, there is the abandoned island of Alcatraz, where once serious criminals were imprisoned. Oh, tourists can take a look at the cells and amenities but no one lives there. But, a disgruntled Marine, General Hummel (Ed Harris) takes over the island by force, with a group of loyal underlings. A mostly good soldier and man, Hummel is upset that those who died or were wounded in covert operations get no compensation. His ghastly plan is to launch fatal nerve gas over San Fran if a huge fee is not paid. When the President hears of this operation, he and his staff are greatly alarmed. But, they want to stop Hummel, not negotiate. First, they contact a FBI agent who specializes in biochemistry, Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage). They want him to defuse the poisonous bombs. Since Stan's fiancée has just told him she is pregnant, this man is under great strain. More importantly, how will the military land on the island secretly and get to the rooms where Hummel and company occupy? They need an EXPERT on the island's prison so they choose the only man who ever escaped Alcatraz. He's John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery), a British agent accused of treason. Even though he escaped, Mason was recaptured and has been locked up 30 years! The idea is to offer Mason freedom in exchange for helping with the mission. Brother, they don't have a clue how honked off Mason is until the negotiations begin! Mason demands a night in a hotel room, room service, and a posh haircut. That is just the start! Will Mason and Goodspeed be able to help thwart the destruction of San Francisco's large population? This outstanding action film has non-stop thrills and a great cast. Sophisticated Connery and wacky Cage are great foils while Harris makes his character sympathetic in spite of all. Naturally the scenery in the Bay area and on the island are exemplary while the script has humor amid the very serious plot elements. Do you want to view a film with breathless action amid twists, turns, and occasional laughs? This one will ROCK your world!",9,3,4,10 October 2017
The King's Speech," I give a speech, a toast, a rousing ovation to this beautiful, beautiful film!
","Prince Albert, later King George (Colin Firth) is second in line to the throne, behind his handsome, suave, still-single brother David (Guy Pearce). His father, the present king (Michael Gambon) is rather a cold, demanding type, as is his wife (Claire Bloom). Therefore, for a fete at Wembeley stadium, he sends 'Bertie' to give a speech, even though HE KNOWS his son has a speech impediment, a stammer (stutter). Its a sad occasion. Although there have been specialists called in over the years, Albert's loyal wife (Helena Bonham Carter) decides to try another, highly recommended therapist. Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), an Australian with unusual tactics, practices out of his home, where his loving wife (Jennifer Ehle) and his three brilliant young sons also live. Thus, the Prince has to go there in secret. At first, Bertie dislikes his teacher, especially when the man wants to know his life story, to account for his hesitant speech. The royal will have none of that, although the prince is hiding some important secret details of his younger days. However, circumstances change. The present king dies and David, having fallen in love with an American divorcée, Wallis Simpson, gives up the throne for 'the woman I love'. Bertie is thus king. World War II is approaching rapidly and the king will have to give his first important speech. Will Logue's help get him through? Or will the king's stammer embarrass him, his two lovely daughters, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret Rose, his wife, and the entire country? This beautiful, beautiful film deserves speeches, toasts, ovations and accolades by the dozen. This true story is a touching heart grabber, especially when the viewer can go behind the walls of palace life to learn the private details behind public lives. The cast is tremendous, with Firth giving a prize-worthy turn as the afflicted prince. Rush, too, is his usual wonderful self, while Bonham Carter brings the lady we know as the 'Queen Mother' to life with great feeling. Gambon, Bloom, Derek Jacoby, Pearce, Ehle, and all of the others do great work, too. Naturally, the sets are gloriously elegant, as are the costumes and camera work. The script illuminates the real history of Britain's former king with finesse while the direction is interestingly varied and full of life. In short, don't miss out on one of the best movie experiences of the year and make plans for a showing as soon as possible.",9,4,8,4 January 2011
The Mask," There's absolutely no masking of the fun here, this film is hugely entertaining
","Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) is a glorified bank teller and a shy, 'nice guy'. This means his salary, prestige, and success with women are very limited. Living in a small apartment with his faithful dog, Milo, and with the landlady from Hades next door, Stanley keeps trying, nevertheless. When the lovely Tina Carlisle (Cameron Diaz), a lounge singer, comes to open an account, Ipkiss is more than attentive and gracious. One day later, his car breaks down and he is also thrown into the gutter by a pretentious nightclub bouncer. Ending up in a river, our hero finds an old wooden mask. For some unknown reason, he takes the relic home and flings it onto the couch. But, aha! That mask is magic and the following evening, Stanley is compelled to put it on. From that moment, Stanley is transformed, when the sun goes down, into a green-faced, super-powered, ultra-confident man. Heading toward the nightclub where he was rejected, he scores a hit with the crowd and with the lovely Tina. But, during the night, he also beats up some thugs and scared his landlady, so the police detective (Peter Riegert) comes by to ask questions. With the mob gaining power in the town, especially Tina's horrific boyfriend, Dorian, the detective wants to curtail the criminal activity. But, can Stanley avoid the urge when the mask's powerful magnetism comes calling? This is a hugely entertaining film that masks none of the fun from its intended audience. Although there is enough violence and sexual connotations to make the film unsuitable for the youngest, older children and adults will delight in the flick's antics and Carrey's irresistible performance. As the man who goes from 'zero to hero', Carrey's genius for physical comedy is a total delight. The supporting cast is also nice, with Diaz a huge asset in her first major film, for she is utterly gorgeous and sweet. Riegert, too, is dead-pan fun as the uber-serious detective, while all of the other cast members give equally memorable turns. The setting in seedy 'Edge City' is marvelously tacky while the costumes, especially Tina's knockout outfits, are very nice. As for the script, the direction, and the special effects, they are all beyond great. Miraculous might be a better word! In short, if your goal for an evening's film choice is to laugh, laugh, and laugh some more, here is a first tier candidate. It would be difficult to see anyone not having a swell time while watching The Mask.",9,1,1,22 December 2008
The Benchwarmers," It's easy to warm up to the Benchwarmers but the potty humor goes a bit too far
","Gus, Richie, and Clark are three of life's wallflowers. Richie, for example, still works in a video store and has never kissed a girl while Clark has a paper route and thrills to macaroni and cheese dinners from mother. When they spot a baseball team full of bullies doing their thing on a group of sweet nerds, they hatch a plan. The three of them will take on any little league team that has swelled heads and cold hearts. Nevermind that only Gus can hit and pitch, the trio do quite well and create havoc for the bad news bears everywhere. They even get a sponsor who promises a lovely new baseball field to the winner of the benchwarmers vs. bullies season. But, are there secrets that will destroy the benchwarmers noble ideals? This is a funny movie, without a doubt. The three stars, Schneider, Spade, and Heder, are a winning and wacky combination, to say the least. The gentleman who plays Richie's agoraphobic brother is a scene-stealing guffaw machine as well. The movie has top notch production values in costuming, scenery, script and more. The only problem, in-your-face throughout the film, is the bathroom humor that goes too far. Parents should be cautioned about this gross-out material before the family sits down to watch the movie together. Nevertheless, Benchwarmers has some good messages and giggles galore. It should be a hit with older children and fun-loving adults everywhere.",6,0,0,13 July 2006
Whip It," Whip out five stars for Drew Barrymore, Ellen Page & company, rolls onto victory from the first frames
","Bliss (Ellen Page) lives in the small town of Bodine, Texas, where she goes to high school and works after class at the Oink Joint. Her mother, Brooke (Marcia Gay Harden), now a mail carrier, was once a small-time beauty pageant winner and enters her daughters in every nearby competition. Although Bliss does not like the gigs, she doesn't want to hurt her pushy mother and, in truth, shines at the pageants, due to her intelligent answers. Nevertheless, it is only her younger sister who comes home with the big trophies. Their father (Daniel Stern) does not want to cross his wife concerning his kids' extracurricular activities. One day, Bliss and her closest friend see a poster for a roller derby in Austen and, thinking they will meet some nice fellows, make up some fibs to attend. Once there, Bliss is awestruck. Attractive ladies whip around the rink, jostling for points and attention. Could she, Bliss, do this, too? Lying about her age, the young waitress is soon renamed Babe Ruthless and becomes part of the Hurl Scouts team. A very fast skater, her stardom and team begin to rise in the standings. But, since her parents do not know she is not attending the SAT classes she said she was while she is out of the house and with a young rock singer making eyes at her, will Bliss' future be, well, blissful? This is a five star, knockout debut for Barrymore and all of the others. What an intriguing, heartfelt story and homage to a little-known 'sport' and what an energetic, inventive direction of it by our little Drew, now grown-up. The swimming pool scene alone is worth any ticket price. Then, too, the characters are wonderfully real and touching. Especially admirable is the way conflicts are resolved without shouting and with much love. In the main roles, Page, Harden, Stern, Barrymore herself, Juliette Lewis, Jimmy Fallon and all, all of the other cast members are terrific! The setting in Texas is lovely, the costumes are quite nice and every one of the other production niceties are topnotch. In short, whip out even twelve bucks or more to see this totally winning film. Awesome, Drew and Ellen, simply awesome...you go, girls!",10,2,6,14 October 2009
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Let the secret out, this film is fun and exciting, with a terrific ensemble cast
","Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) is at it again. When a mysterious man (Ed Harris) shows up at Gates' lecture on Lincoln and the civil war and denigrates a relative of Ben's, Gates is out to prove him wrong. Trouble is, how? Enlisting the help of his father, Patrick (Jon Voight), his estranged girlfriend, Abby (Diane Kruger), his professor mother (Helen Mirren), and the computer-whiz wonderboy, Riley (Justin Bartha), Ben soon learns that the path to clear his ancestor's name will take him down the road of a lost treasure of gold, as well. Traveling to Paris, London and the Black Hills, Ben and company get closer and closer. Ben even 'kidnaps' the President of the U.S. (Bruce Greenwood) in a grotto near Mount Vernon, but, only to ask him some important questions. But, others may be after the treasure, too, and, now of course, Ben is in trouble with the FBI. Will Ben locate the gold or will he end up in the penitentiary? This is a fun, fun flick with a terrific cast and an exciting story. It's no secret that Cage is one of the top American actors of all time (he's my personal favorite, check out Adaptation, Matchstick Men, and It Could Happen to You, among others) and he commands the attention of all viewers with his charm and energy. Keeping pace, Voight, Mirren, Kruger, and Bartha also give sweet, lovable, humorous performances. Harris is good as the heavy and Greenwood shines as a caring, intelligent President, where do you find one like him? The tale, somewhat implausible, naturally, is brimming with so much history that young fans are certain to head to the library and the Internet to find out what is true and what is imagined. Add on nice costumes, gorgeous scenery, and excellent photography and production values and you can see why the film will succeed at the box office. Please, make time for you family to see this movie sometime soon. Everyone will treasure the experience.",7,2,5,29 December 2007
Blade Runner 2049," Amazing film, run to find it!
","K (Ryan Gosling) is a replicant made by Niander Wallace (Jared Leto) and company to 'retire' replicants made by the Tyrell Corporation of the original Blade Runner. In the opening sequences, he has found a male Nexus hiding in a barren plot of land with the only tree for miles. K delivers the retirement, after a struggle. More importantly, all evidence near the house is collected, including a box of bones. It is determined that a female REPLICANT, in spite of impossible odds, gave birth at this outpost years ago and the child may have survived. Thus, K's boss (Robin Wright) tells him his new job is to hunt and retire the offspring. Meanwhile, Wallace and his principal henchwoman, Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) are watching K's actions, for they want his retirement project to succeed. The lone person providing support for K is his virtual reality girlfriend, Joi (Ana de Armas) who is thrilled when K buys a device that lets her accompany him on outings. In his investigation, K tries to locate previous Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) and his sidekick Gaff (Edward James Olmos) for they may hold critical clues. More disturbing, K begins to have memories of his orphan childhood which seem more real than typical implanted recalls given to replicants. He even seeks out Dr. Steele (Carla Juri) a maker of memories for Niander Wallace. Incredibly, the doctor, who lives alone behind a glass fortress, reveals his memories are genuine as well. Is K's heritage now apparent? This amazing film has one minor flaw. It is a bit too long and slow paced for many viewers. However, its concepts are head-turning, its cast is incredible, and its design / effects are 'out of this world'. Villeneuve pays homage and breaks new ground in the saga of Philip K Dick's Blade Runner. Yes, I waited way too long to view a wonderful sequel to one of my favorite films of all time. Don't make the same mistake, run now to catch it!",9,3,7,7 March 2018
Angels & Demons," Fascinating story, relentless pace make this a great watch!
","Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), an expert on symbols, is called to Rome post haste. Although they are keeping things quiet, the authorities tell Langdon horrible news. The Pope has died and the four strongest candidates to succeed him have been kidnapped by a terrorist (Nikolaj Lie Kass). The assassin has declared that beginning at 8:00pm that evening, one of the Cardinals will be killed every hour on the hour, at area churches. It appears that the killer is working for The Illuminati, a group of scientists with a long history of war with the Catholic church, reaching back 500 years. As if that was not enough, the killer has stolen an 'anti-matter' device which will be exploded at midnight and which will annihilate anyone within 20 miles of Rome. Ugh. Langdon works feverishly to unravel the mystery, with the help of the head of the Swiss Guard (Stellan Skaarsgard) and the late Pope's personal assistant, Patrick (Ewan McGregor). But, when 8 o'clock tolls, the Prof and his group reach the church a couple of minutes late to save the first Cardinal. How will they fare into the night? This is a very exciting and fascinating story with a relentless pace and a fine, fine cast. Hanks is truly great as the sardonic, nonreligious expert and McGregor succeeds in his meaty role of a troubled soul underneath an innocent demeanor. The supporting cast, although unknown to this viewer, are also very good, with special mention to Kass for his deeply scary role as the assassin. Naturally, the scenery in and around Rome is amazingly lovely and costumes, camera work and other film niceties are of the finest caliber. As for Howard's direction and the tantalizing story, they deserve much praise, for there is no time to catch one's breath before the next big event. On a humorous note, Howard has cast his father, Rance, in the role of a southern-drawl Cardinal and it is too, too funny. So, if you thought this was a flick to skip, do reconsider your decision. This one will fulfill any thinking man or woman's wish for a night of sound entertainment.",8,3,8,24 June 2009
Changeling," Very powerful tale of crushing sorrow and horror, intense and not for the faint of heart
","Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) lives in the Lincoln Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles in 1928. Her husband took off long ago and left her the sole caretaker of her nine year old son, Walter. To make ends meet, Christine works long hours as a supervisor for a local telephone company, where she is respected as a very hard-working employee. One Saturday, as she was planning to take Walter to the motion picture theater, she is asked to fill in for an emergency situation at work. Making a promise to Walter that they will shift their plans to Sunday, Christine has no choice but to leave the young boy at home alone, although neighbors will check in on him every couple of hours. However, after work, Christine comes home to an empty house. Walter has vanished. When she contacts the police, they are singularly unhelpful and uncaring, surprisingly. But, after several months of searching, the police notify Christine that Walter has been found in Illinois and will be returning on the train. It is categorically untrue, as Christine sees immediately that the young boy stepping off the train is not her son. Yet, the police ask her to smile for the cameras and take this lad home and study him, for they tell her young children can change quite dramatically. Reluctantly, Christine does so. But, it soon becomes crystal clear that this boy is not hers, as he is three inches shorter, among other anatomical differences. Frustrated and upset, Christine continues to tell the police that a mistake has been made and she urges them to find her son and this new boy's relatives. Unbelievably, the police declare her to be 'crazy' and they escort her to the local mental hospital for an indefinite stay. Only one person seems to be on her side, the local and powerful Presbyterian minister (John Malkovich) and he works tirelessly to help. Meanwhile, at a broken-down ranch near the city, police find a young boy from Canada who has enormous secrets to tell, all of them horrific. Can these secrets offer clues to Walter's whereabouts? This is a very powerful story of immense injustice, horror and sorrow. It clearly shows that evil walks among us, no matter what time period we find ourselves in. As the principal actor, Jolie is sensational, for she is heartbreakingly genuine as the mother who not only loses her son and her freedom but is a witness to unspeakable horror as well. Malkovich, too, is excellent as the combative and relentless man of the cloth. All of the other actors, although unknown, give extremely fine performances, too, especially the man who plays the police captain and the one who portrays the insane rancher-serial killer. As for the recreation of 1920's Los Angeles, through sets, costumes, script, and photography, is is very well done and Eastwood's direction is secure and forceful, despite the film's length of two and a half hours. Nevertheless, if you can not handle a story that will haunt you for days, due to its extremely horrific nature, don't see this one. Although it is a fine, fine piece of cinema, it is a most difficult watch indeed.",8,11,18,9 November 2008
Frost_Nixon," Don't nix this flick, no matter what your feelings are for Nixon! It is a wonderfully compelling film!
","David Frost (Michael Sheen) is an up and coming British talk show host in 1977. He is very ambitious and he also has an eye for the ladies. One day, he hears that if he could get Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) on his show, it would boost his image and credibility, especially if he could trick 'Tricky Dick' into admissions of error and guilt. John Birt (Matthew Macfadyen), a close friend of David's and a producer, thinks its a good idea but wonders how they will come up with the money to entice Nixon to commit to the interviews. Working on a shoestring and borrowed money, the two Brits succeed in getting the former president to agree to a series of four conversations. Soon after, Frost and Birt travel to San Clemente to meet the fallen leader and find a venue for their talks. Guarding the situation is Nixon's ally, Jack Brennan (Kevin Bacon), who is hoping Nixon can redeem himself with his own explanations and turn the tables on the inexperienced Frost. So, the stage is set. Helping Frost in his preparations are two American journalists (Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell), each of them a Nixon-loather. Will Frost succeed in getting Nixon's to admit his law-breaking errors in judgment? This is a fine, fine film based on an equally fine stage play. For everyone who thinks they know enough about Nixon, don't believe it! Even the most die-hard Tricky Dick 'haters' will have their eyes opened by Nixon's terrific mind and fighting spirit. As Nixon, Langella gives a tremendous performance, for although he does not physically resemble Nixon much, he MAKES the viewer believe he is, indeed, the former president. Sheen holds his own well against such a co-star, giving a great turn as the outwardly confident, inwardly insecure talk show personality. Of course, it is wonderful to see Macfadyen again (the whole world fell for him in Pride and Prejudice and loved him in Death at a Funeral) and he does not disappoint in his role as a sunny-haired, astute producer. Platt and Rockwell, too, deserve big applause for their wit and dogged determination in their roles as advisers who wish to slice Nixon into little pieces. Viewers will also love the rest of the cast, including Bacon, McCormack, and the rest of the players. Then, too, Nixon's mansion in San Clemente is so utterly gorgeous, everyone will be making plans to buy a winning lotto ticket and get an estate just like it. Costumes and hairstyles nicely show that 70's style while production values, script and direction are very, very fine, too. In brief, don't nix Frost/Nixon, whatever you do! It is a fine recreation of a the interviews that showed the world Nixon's strengths and his weaknesses and made a name out of the attention-seeking but talented Frost.",8,3,8,25 January 2009
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The funniest movie ever made? No, but very, very funny indeed and a fine roast of a country whose ego is way too inflated
","Borat (Sasha Baron Cohen) is a television reporter from a country, near Russia, whose name nobody can spell or pronounce. As the nation is somewhat backward, in some ways, Borat is sent to the USA. There, Borat is to learn ways and ideas to improve his own country's situation. As Borat lands in NYC, he first learns you just don't kiss everyone on the cheeks, especially on the subway. Then, at the hotel, Borat discovers Baywatch on the telly and is instantly smitten with Pamela Anderson. Forget about shooting footage in the Big Apple alone. Borat now wants to go to California and meet Pamela. The only vehicle he and his partner can afford is a postal-type delivery truck. Nevertheless, Borat and his companion set off to learn from America. What will he glean from American society that will benefit his homeland? Not much, you say? This is a funny, funny film, although the humor is definitely on the raunchy side. Just watch Borat interview a group of feminists or visit a garage sale and you will be chortling mightily. Cohen has perfect timing and knows exactly how to make the audience laugh at the same moment he is getting in his digs about American culture. In fact, despite the supporting cast, which is quite fine, this is movie is Borat, Borat, and more Borat, with Cohen carrying the film with ease. If you are easily offended by humor that is a bit off-color, do not see this film. You probably would laugh at the antics but may experience guilt later. But, if you want to laugh your head off for an evening and are the adventurous type, you simply must see Borat. No one will remain poker-faced in the face of Borat and giggling to the point of tears is what lies ahead for anyone who sits down to watch this fine film.",8,1,6,27 December 2006
The Incredible Hulk," Incredible, no, but worthwhile, thanks to a touching performance by Norton, a great supporting cast and fabulous special effects
","Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) has been living in a barrio in Brazil for the last year. This is because he is a wanted man, after a laboratory accident that went awry. As you may have heard, Banner was exposed to gamma radiation and when he is overly 'excited', he turns into a nearly all-powerful monster called the Hulk. In his monstrous form, he killed several folks in the United States. But, unbelievably, that is not exactly why he is being pursued. A bonehead military man, Ross (William Hurt) is after Banner so that Bruce's blood can be used to generate another super-being, rendering the American army invincible. Ross' beautiful daughter, Elizabeth (Liv Tyler), a biology professor, was once involved with Banner and is still the object of the fugitive's affections. To help capture Banner, the elder Ross enlists the aid of a Russian-turned-Brit, Rambo-type (Tim Roth) who is very successful at snaring his prey. But, Banner still has a few tricks up his sleeve, as he seeks the aid of an online scientist who may have a cure for his condition. So, who will emerge victorious, Banner or his misguided seekers? This is a good film with unbelievably great special effects and a wonderfully touching performance by Norton. It is on these two strengths that the film succeeds, for the script is uneven and inferior, the direction is one-handed and the events a series of implausibilities. No, it is not the science that is lacking, it is the supposed intelligence of the military. Knowing what this man-monster can do, how could anyone possibly believe that humans could claim victory? Yet, Hurt's character is built on that misguided belief. As stated, Norton is a wonder, for he infuses his character with courage, smarts, and sensitivity. The rest of the cast is quite fine, too, as Tyler, Hurt, and Roth fulfill their roles nicely and the lesser actors do a good job as well. The opening chase scene in the barrio is exciting, even though the viewer feels Banner was deliberately placed in Brazil so that the scene could happen. All other scenery is quite wonderful, too, as the viewer is transported to Guatemala, Mexico, D.C. and even to British Columbia. Costumes are fetching but of small importance. Noteworthy, too, are the fabulous special effects, as Banner's transformation into the Hulk is most impressive and the havoc that ensues when he is in action is mind-boggling. However, the storyline is not worthy of such dazzlement, being, virtually, one long hunting excursion. Should one skip it? No, not at all, as it has enough good elements to make it worthwhile. But, it is far below the bar set by such wonderful movies as this summer's Iron Man or the original Batman.",7,2,4,8 October 2008
The Sound of Music," My parents let me see this great movie five times, when I was a child, there were no DVDs
","Maria (Julie Andrews) lives in Austria. She grew up in the mountains but now lives at a convent in Salzburg, where she is in study to become a nun. Yet, she is a 'problem', as the older sisters say, for she sings at the wrong times, is often tardy and runs off to the mountains when she should be studying. Therefore, the Mother Superior decides that Maria should leave the convent for a short time and become the governess for a widower, the Naval Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). He has SEVEN energetic children! This opportunity will give Maria a chance to contemplate whether a life in the abbey is really suited for her. So, off she goes. The children, many times ignored by their grieving father, are brats and try to drive Maria away by putting a frog in her pocket and making her sit on a pine cone. But, they have underestimated their new governess. She points out their misbehavior in a subtle way and wins them over with her kindness. Soon, though, the father goes to visit Vienna, where he may be courting a baroness (Eleanor Parker). While he is gone, Maria makes the kids some play clothes, takes them on picnics and teaches them to sing, things their father has not done. The Captain returns with this new love interest and gives a grand ball in her honor. The kids love it. But, during the event, the Captain and Maria accidentally share a dance and look into each other's eyes. Scared of her feelings, Maria goes back to the convent on the sly. Both the children and their father are heartbroken, for she has become very important to them. Will she return? Will Maria admit her feelings for the gentleman and abandon plans to become a nun? With Hitler in power in Germany, too, will Austria be able to avoid the Nazi sweep across Europe? This beloved film was my childhood favorite. I adored the music, the photography, the cast and everything else about it. My parents even let me go the theater five times to see it, knowing how much I was entranced with the movie. My thanks go out to them. In such a light, its pretty much a given that viewers everywhere, from 4 to 90, will also delight in the flick. As stated, all aspects from the music to the acting to the direction and more, are of superior quality, making it a rare movie indeed. So, any day, any time, any season, seek this one out for you and all those you love.",10,5,14,10 April 2012
Skyfall," Superlative is Skyfall, do not miss it film fans
","James Bond (Daniel Craig) is in Istanbul, tracking an evil hitman Patrice. This bad dude has killed a British agent and now James has to begin a wild chase to prevent him from getting away. Backing him up is lovely Eve (Naomie Harris). The two agents chase him through streets by car, then James jumps on a motorcycle to follow through markets and over rooftops. Finally, Mr. Bond jumps on a train Patrice has boarded and the two fight it out on the train's rooftop. Ordered by M (Judi Dench) to take a shot, poor Eve ends up wounding James, who falls into the water. Patrice gets away and Bond is presumed dead and gone. But, not so. After a brief hiatus, Bond appears in London again, when the Secret Service building is set on fire. M is very glad to see him, because Patrice's boss has captured a disc with agents' names all over the world and M herself is getting scary messages. Traveling to Shanghai, Bond again wrestles with Patrice on a high rise and Patrice is thrown to his death. Nevertheless, James melts the heart of a beautiful underling Severine and they travel to meet the top evildoer, Silva (Javier Bardem). Silva, once an agent for Britain, makes clear his plans to continue killing. But, oh, Bond gets the upper hand and takes Silva prisoner to London, where he is sentenced to prison. But, is this really where Silva will go or does he have ingenious plans to break out of his chains? Unfortunately, the ex-agent does and its all out war between Silva and the Brits. How will it end? This film deserves ten stars for its superlative cast, plot, cinematography and every other element. Craig is so good as his own battle weary type of Bond while Bardem is one of the top villains in Bond history, being evil, mad, but somehow to be pitied. All of the others, including Dench, Harris, Ralph Fiennes, Albert Finney and Ben Whishaw are also topnotch. As for the scenery, it is sumptuous while the direction by Sam Mendes is beyond terrific. Bond fan or not, don't, don't, do not MISS SKYFALL.",10,2,5,1 December 2019
The Young Victoria," To be Blunt, haha, Emily B does beautiful work in this lovely bit of historical drama
","Princess Victoria (Emily Blunt) is in line for the throne of England. The present King William (Jim Broadbent) is not well and may not live long. However, Vicky's scheming mother, The Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richandson) and her aide, John (Mark Strong) want to force Victoria to sign papers declaring them to be the 'regents' until she is older, since she is only 20 years of age. The young lady refuses, despite John slapping her around. It is another sign that Victoria has a strong will and deep love for her country. Yet, when William does pass away, shortly after her 21st birthday, Victoria knows she has a heavy duty before her. First, she must surround herself with the 'right' advisers to govern wisely. She chooses handsome Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) who, although an older man, is mentioned as a suitor for Vicky. Which brings us to the young queen's second major decision. Sooner than not, the young queen should select her future mate, as it will bring stability to her life and to those of the kingdom, for an heir must appear in the coming years. Meanwhile, in Germany, some distant relatives of the British royal family are hatching some plans as well. Handsome Prince Albert (Rupert Friend), of the Saxon-Coburg dynasty, is prodded by his father to court the young English royal. Once he arrives at the palace, he is smitten and the feeling seems to be mutual. But, since he is a minor player on the map of royal match-making, can he succeed in winning her heart? This is a lovely film, made even better by a completely winning performance by Emily Blunt as Victoria. Yes, she is beautiful but it is her intelligent reading of the role that scores mightily. Friend, too, does well, as do the other actors, including Broadbent, Richardson, Bettany, Strong (what a repulsive role!), and the rest. Also, the movie is gorgeously shot, costumed, and set, making it a visual treat in every way. If anything is lacking, it is an extra dose of dazzle, as the film seems a bit too straightforward and prosaic, at times, with a somewhat unimaginative edit. However, this is only a minor, minor point of argument in an overall very successful and gorgeous film. In short, young and old, should make time for Young Victoria. It is a most worthy film among 2009 cinematic offerings.",8,34,39,27 January 2010
The Hangover," So funny, so clever but, so raunchy, you don't want to tell your Sunday School class that you saw it!
","Doug (Justin Bartha) is about to walk down the aisle with a beautiful lady, Tracy (Sasha Barrese). Therefore, his pals are taking him to Vegas for a big bachelor bash. These include schoolteacher Phil (Bradley Cooper), businessman Stu (Ed Helms) and Doug's soon-to-be brother-in-law Alan (Zach Galifianakis). Free-spirit Phil is trying to loosen everyone up, for Doug is less than adventurous, Stu is hogtied to his girlfriend from Hades, Melissa, who thinks they are going to Napa Valley for a wine tasting, and Alan is a chubby, consummate weirdo. The friends arrive at the hotel and go up on the roof for a toast. That's the last thing they remember, for in the morning, they wake up in a daze. A tiger is in their bathroom, a baby boy is in the kitchen, and Doug is missing. What happened in-between and why can't they remember? As they try to piece things together, while taking care of the little lad, they have encounters with the Korean mafia, Mike Tyson, a hooker who is sporting Stu's grandmother's ring, and more. Will they find Doug in time for him to make it to the ceremony? This film is very clever and very funny, sending most of the audience into a bellyache of laughter. However, it is definitely on the raunchy side, which some filmgoers will find offensive. You definitely don't want to mention in Sunday School class that you saw it. The cast is nice, with Cooper and Bartha quite fine as the two friends, and the lesser cast members are great, too. But, stealing the show, are Helms and Galifianakis, for they are funny beyond words and create very memorable characters in Stu and Alan, respectfully. The scenery in Vegas is glitzy while the costumes, camera work and other film amenities are very fine. Most importantly, great applause should be extended to the devilishly clever script and the rapid-fire direction. That does not mean, however, that drug use, excessing drinking, and other unsavory practices will seem 'funny' to everyone. But, all in all, unless you are supremely hungover and have your head in the toilet, you would do well to head to the cinema for this one, all you comedy seekers. It is a laugh riot, period, adios, sayonara.",8,4,6,16 June 2009
Deja Vu," Starts off so promising but, unhappily, the film becomes a confusing mess; Washington is great, however, as are the other cast members
","In New Orleans, a community still suffering from Hurricane Katrina, a group of people are at the gulf shoreline. They are welcoming back their relatives in the United States Navy, who are arriving on a ferry. However, tragically, the ferry blows up near the coast, killing many of the military men and folks on land. How can this be? Who planted such a massive bomb? Soon, government officials, such as Paul (Val Kilmer), and the man in charge (Bruce Greenwood) are telling the public the investigation will take some time, for the ferry is now under water and they have few leads. Onto the scene arrives ATF agent Doug (Denzel Washington), who was one of the principal investigators of the Oklahoma City bombing. The other men are reluctant to let him join the team, for reasons unknown, for he has already discovered some key elements they overlooked. However, Doug, while engaging, is a driven man and he becomes even more so when a beautiful female victim, Claire (Paula Patton) washes up on the shore. Unbelievably, forensic evidence indicates that she was killed BEFORE the explosion and dumped in the water, to throw investigators off kilter. Also, Doug learns that it was HER van, stolen most likely, that was rigged with the bomb that blew up the ferry. Further, Paul asks Doug to review a series of tapes, made with satellite surveillance, that may offer clues on how to find the person responsible. Or, are they really tapes or something else? Is it possible to reverse what happened to Claire and all of the others? This story started off so well that the last half was a major disappointment. This was not the fault of the cast, however, for Washington is marvelous, as are Kilmer (how nice to see him!), Greenwood, lovely Patton, Adam Goldberg, Jim Cavaziel and a host of others. In fact, Washington, despite the somber nature of the film, is funny, smart, and a total joy. Also fine is the setting, costuming and photography. Therefore, what is to blame for the film's ultimate failure, my view, is the complicated plot which strains plausibility. One minute, the movie is zipping along, offering real possibilities in the actual world and, then, it morphs into a science fiction, hard-to-swallow thriller. A much better film would have resulted if the story would had stayed as a typical whodonit, for as it is, the flick is confusing and meandering, with a far from satisfying conclusion. Yes, the direction has energy but there is nothing that will rectify the situation when the tale collapses. In short, if you like the cast, especially Washington, or thrillers, give it a whirl, for you may see things conversely to what this critic does. As for me, oh how I wish it had turned out differently!",5,0,1,24 February 2011
Casablanca," A classic, in romance, in story, in cast and everything else
","Rick (Humphrey Bogart) once lived in Paris, before World War II broke out. An ex-pat American, he now runs a cafe, named after him, in Casablanca, Morocco. Its 1942 and many folks who want to escape Hitler arrive in Morocco to look for a visa to go to the United States. Not very many are successful. So, Rick sees desperate people every day at his establishment. Most of the time he is unmoved, as for some reason, Rick is a jaded fellow. However, he does come across a pair of valuable visas when someone trusts him to hid them in his piano player Sam's instrument. Not long after, 'THE WOMAN', Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) comes into the place, asking Sam to play a song Rick has forbidden him to play. When he comes rushing to chastise him, he meets Ilsa. Flashing back, we learn that Ilsa had a grand love with Rick in Paris, just as the Nazis were getting closer and closer. Yet, when they made plans to escape on a train, Rick was jilted on the platform. No Ilsa arrived. Now, will Rick learn why this happened? Yes! Ilsa had a huge secret which comes spilling out, only to make Rick hurt all over again. In the meanwhile, the Germans in town are trying to find an escaped hero of their concentration camps, Victor (Paul Henreid). He is the most wanted man in Africa and word has it he's coming to Casablanca. Can Rick be an uncaring spectator forever? This beautiful, classic film has everything, as you have probably heard. It's a fine romance, with grand passion indeed. The story is a heart grabber and the cast is superlative. Made before anyone knew how long Hitler would remain in power, and at a time when he was winning the war, one sees how all of Europe wanted to escape his clutches. If you have never taken the time to watch Casablanca, don't delay. Almost every movie fan agrees that it is a top ten listing every time.",10,3,4,21 February 2019
Gravity," Hav to see Grav-ity, a unique and wonderful film experience
","At the USA Space Station above the earth, Ryan (Sandra Bullock) and her commander, Matt (George Clooney) are working to repair some mechanical problems. More specifically at this moment in time, Matt is trying to set a record for space-walking while keeping an eye on Ryan, who is on her first mission. Bad news arrives. Russia shot a missile into the sky and it hit another satellite, breaking it into bits. Now debris is headed for the USA station. Matt orders Ryan inside yet she is reluctant to leave a job almost done. As the waste comes at them, the station is destroyed, Ryan is hurled into space and Matt is loosely tethered to a part of the station. Yet, although the other crew members have died, all may not be lost for Ryan and Matt. First, the older astronaut rescues Ryan from flying off into space. Then, if the two can make it, space walking, to a Russian station nearby, they can fly one of the Russkies' shuttles home. It will not be easy but, they have a chance. On the way to their oasis, however, landing on the station becomes tricky. Soon, Matt is in jeopardy and he sacrifices himself for Ryan, knowing its the only choice. Scared to the core, what more must Ryan do to make it back to earth? How can she do it all by herself? Ah, but she may have inner resources left, ones she doesn't even know she has! This fabulous, unique film has to be seen, especially on a big screen. Its thrilling story is enhanced by spectacular performances, direction and cinematography. One truly does feel as weightless as the astronauts, during a view, and in just as much peril. Movies come and movies go, but you hav to see Grav-ity. What a thrill ride in space!",10,5,8,31 October 2013
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," I laughed, I cheered, I cried for this FABULOUS new entry into the Star Wars Saga
","On a remote farming planet, a gentleman named Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) lives with this wife and young daughter Jyn (later Felicity Jones). They are part of the rebel alliance, trying to stay away from the Imperial forces, for Galen is a brilliant scientist and they want him to work for their destructive Empire. Its not known how long this family has been in hiding but they have schooled their daughter on where to hide if the BAD FOLKS come calling. They do. Governor Tarkin (Guy Henry) flies in and Galen tries to face his team alone. All too soon, his wife is shot as she tries to save her husband and Dr. Erso is captured. The forces fail to find Jyn but, instead, a friend of her father's, Saw Herrera (Forest Whitaker) rescues and raises her. Flash forwarding several years, we find that Jyn is in a prison work camp, somehow abandoned by Saw. When a transport she is riding in comes under attack by rebels, she escapes and soon matches up with Cassian (Diego Luna). Initially, they save each other as they maneuver this outpost of a planet. Yet, soon Cassian's plan is spilled. He must go to Saw Herrera's planet so he can FIND details of Dr. Erso and learn the fate of a trader pilot sent to talk with Saw as well. With his trusted 're-programmed' Imperial Droid, K-250 (Alan Tudyk), they are amazed to find that Jyn is his little girl. Off they go. It is on this sacred planet that they discover a monastery is in ruins and the whole place turned into a giant mining establishment, collecting fuel for a new, deadly weapon of the Empire. You guessed it, its for the Death Star. Two monks, one blind, help Jyn and Cassian locate Saw, where Jyn views a holographic message sent from her father, explaining his ultimate triumph. Despite having to build the Death Star, he has put in a secret spot of vulnerability, where the massive weapon can be destroyed. They must go to the planet where video blueprints are housed and retrieve it for the Rebels. Oh, is that all? When they make it back to the Rebel base, Jyn and Cassian are stunned that the group is ready to surrender, having witnessed the power of the Death Star. But, a small group, including the two monks, the rescued pilot, and K-250 are ready to risk all! Will they be successful? There's no question what this answer will be, but there is much sacrifice involved, sadly. This FABULOUS new entry to the Star Wars saga is exceptionally well done. The new characters are amazing, with Jones and Luna making a fine pair, and the rest so endearing, so brave. As the cast boasts a wide variety of alien creatures, as well, it is a great joy. Next, the sets couldn't be better, with an absolutely amazing creation of different planets to feast your eyes upon. Add on the great costumes, superb special effects, terrific story and never-lagging direction and here is a film to cherish indeed. George Lucas himself is most likely thunder-struck at the connection to his own first story, as this one takes place right before the actions of A New Hope. But, a warning, this is probably the most tear-generating entry of the series, so bring tissues. There is even a scene which hearkens back to another great film, Deep Impact, and is equally poignant. But, in truth, don't go rogue and think you can miss this one. Get off your behind now and rush to the theater!",10,4,8,9 January 2017
Coraline," Totally stunning visuals and a strong story give this film high, high marks
","Coraline (voiced by Dakota Fanning) is a young girl with less-than-perfect parents. Her mother (Teri Hatcher) and dad are work-from-home writers trying to put out a gardening catalog, giving very little attention to their pre-teen daughter. Dad does the cooking but meals are less than optimal, also, as shopping sometimes gets rushed or overlooked. Then, too, they have moved their household to a fabulous old Victorian mansion in the sticks and Coraline misses her friends and former city abode very much. One day, her parents, working feverishly on their catalog, encourage, er, demand that Coraline explore her new house, for it has many rooms, nooks, and crannies. Finding a secret door, Coraline is perplexed to discover that the wall behind the door is bricked up. Yet, at night, a mouse draws her to the doorway and, lo and behold, a secret entrance has appeared like magic. Crawling through a tunnel, Coraline finds herself in an alternate world, where her new mother and father shower her with terrific meals and fun things to do. But, strangely, both of them, while looking like their real world counterparts in most ways, sport 'button' eyes. Since Coraline finds a mysterious doll in her room, who likewise has buttons for eyes and Coraline's features, this is a mystery. But, because her second set of parents are so doting, Coraline can't wait to get back to their world the next night, even though she receives warnings from the neighboring ladies, a young country boy, and the eccentric Russian man who lives upstairs. Is this really a perfect world that Coraline has entered? Not on your life! This is a great film with absolutely stunning visuals, enhanced by 3-D glasses, if you are so fortunate to see such a showing. It would be difficult, indeed, to find a more colorful or imaginative animated film in all of cinema. Most viewers will be oohing and aahing at every turn. The story, too, is strong, interesting, and, even a bit scary for the preschool crowd, without someone's hand to hold. All of the actors voicing their parts, from Fanning to Hatcher to Ian McShane as the Russian man, are very fine, also. In short, Coraline is a terrific film for virtually everyone, young and old, following in the footsteps of such movies as Fantasia or The Nightmare Before Christmas. It is well worth the effort to bundle up the family and march on over to the nearest theater, for it is a 'big' screen film in the scope of its breathtaking animation and it will generate contended sighs all around.",9,2,4,25 February 2009
Shakespeare in Love," Everyone will be in love with this stunningly beautiful film
","William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) is having a major writer's block. He contends he writes best when he has a 'muse', that is, he is in love. No matter that he already has a wife some distance away, he courts many a lovely lass. Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a beautiful young noblewoman whose father has some money but no title. She loves going to the theater productions at the court of Queen Elizabeth I (Judy Dench). With her parents away and Shakespeare set to start work on a new play, Viola disguises herself as a man and auditions for the play. She, um, he gets the part. Will crashes a posh party soon after and spies the real Viola. He's smitten, through and through. But, Viola's parents have already arranged for her to marry a nobleman (Colin Firth) who has a title but needs the money Viola's dowry can provide. Horrors! Nevertheless, Will succeeds in winning Viola's heart and they begin a relationship. As a consequence, Will is inspired to write the lovely but tragic Romeo and Juliet as his new play. But, will there be a tragic ending for Viola and Will, too? This film is more 'lovely than a summer's day'. It is stunningly beautiful and everything is utter perfection. The terrific cast of Fiennes, Paltrow, Dench, Ben Affleck, Geoffrey Rush, Firth, Tom Wilkinson, Rupert Everett, and all of the other actors, are wonderful beyond words. Paltrow and Dench walked off with the Oscars but everyone is truly excellent. Add on the sumptuous costumes, the gorgeous sets and scenery, the excellent script, the vibrant direction, and the fantastic musical score and you have a film with absolutely no flaws whatsoever. So, then, what are you waiting for? This is a film to buy and cherish forever and ever.",10,1,2,12 November 2007
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," 'Forget' the rules of the typical romcom, this one is funny & innovative
","Peter (Jason Segel, who also wrote this gem) is a composer of television theme songs. His longtime girlfriend, Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) is the star of a crime show that sports his musical compositions. But, horror of horrors, Sarah stuns Peter by breaking up with him and moving out. Since Peter was completely in love with Sarah, who did little things like buy him a tupperware container to keep his cereal from getting stale, his heartache is acute. Needing a change, Peter decides to head for Hawaii and clear his head. Yet, when he arrives at a posh hotel and is greeted by a lovely hotel employee, Rachel (Mila Kunis), Pete soon discovers that Sarah is also a guest, along with her new love interest, Brit musician Aldous Snow (Russell Brand)! Now, how in the heck is Peter supposed to 'get over' Sarah when he meets her everywhere, in the restaurants or on the beaches? Trying hard, Peter takes up surfing with a local stonehead (Paul Rudd) and even works himself into a few dates with the lovely Rachel. But, will his heart heal? Forget about the typical romcom rules and just enjoy this 'male' take on the ups and downs of love. Segel should receive much praise for not only starring in this comic winner but writing it as well. Bell is great as the ambitious blonde beauty who is not as empty headed as one might believe and Kunis, with her huge, beautiful eyes, does a fine job as a possible new hearthrob for Peter. Rudd is a hoot as the 24/7 stoner while Brand is likewise hysterical as the full-of-himself rock star. The rest of the cast, including Jonah Hill and Bill Hader, is quite nice as well. As for the Hawaiian setting, it is beautiful to the maximum and worth the ticket or rental price alone. Add on great costumes, amenities, and direction and you have a polished film indeed. The writing is very funny, such as the scene where Peter signs up to help with a luau, not realizing he will asked to 'kill' the poor pig. However, one caveat is that if you are in search of good, clean fun, this one is not the film for you, as it has many risqué, sexually charged scenes & themes. Nevertheless, for couples on the lookout for a flick to please both genders, here is a terrific choice, for it has plenty of raunchy humor and wistful romance at the same incredible time.",8,3,8,5 June 2008
Argo," Superlative! Ergo, don't wait to see Argo
","Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) is called into a top CIA meeting soon after the country of Iran grabbed hostages from the American Embassy in 1979. Since the 'people' of Iran booted the Shah from power and installed Ayatollah Khomeini, they are extremely unhappy that the Shah was given refuge in the United States. Hence, the hostage situation. But, what the Iranians don't know, at present, is that six diplomats escaped their own compound and found quarters in the Canadian embassy. Even though the government workers tried to shred important documents as the mob stormed the building, the new folks in power have put families in the task of re-assembling the pieces of the papers! Since resumes and photos of the staff are included, it is just a matter of time before they realize that some folks fled their clutches. Enter Tony. The CIA informs him and others at the meeting that the Canadians can't keep these folks indefinitely. So, how to get them out? Various proposals are put forth, from suggesting the six bicycle out of Iran, at a great distance, to giving them new identities as Canadian teachers or agricultural missionaries. None seem too plausible. But, Tony comes up with an even more outlandish idea. Why not pretend the six were in Iran as Canadian film makers, working on a sci-fi epic called Argo? Holy Darth Vader! But, since this is the 'best bad idea' available, the USA puts Tony in charge. Naturally, he must make the situation as real as possible so he enlists a Hollywood producer (Alan Arkin), a well-known makeup artist (John Goodman) and an upper level G-man (Bryan Cranston) to help him work out the details. Even so, when Tony flies to Iran, it is with the knowledge that this is a very risky affair, which could result in the torture and death of all those involved. Will Mr. Mendez succeed in rescuing those Americans in peril? What a superlative piece of film-making this is and a triple threat from Oscar winner Affleck. Ben produced it, directed it, and gives a thrilling performance as Tony. Let's all suggest stuffing his arms with trophies! Also, the rest of the cast is likewise wonderful, with Arkin, Goodman, and Cranston turning heads, too. As a movie based on true events that weren't even made public until 20 years after the fact, Mr. Mendez is one of the most unsung heroes this nation has ever had. Naturally, the settings in Iran and Turkey are most exotically wonderful and very great care has been taken to re-create the looks of the late seventies. Well done. Most importantly, Mr. Affleck chose a Middle Eastern narrator to open the film, with a short history lesson on the reasons for the situation. As such, the CIA's coup d'etat, which ousted the duly elected Iranian leader from the fifties and placed the Shah in power, gets the culpability it deserves. Also exposed are the Shah's acts of torture on his own people and his plans to 'westernize' this Muslim country. No, Affleck doesn't hammer these points but audiences should better understand, if they don't already, why there is such discord between Iran and the United States, to this day. The only minor caveat of the movie, which will not be so for everyone, is that there is a good deal of offensive language in the tremendous script. So, be aware. Nevertheless, don't miss out on one of the year's best films, no. Ergo, see Argo NOW.",10,7,15,17 October 2012
The English Patient," One of the greatest achievements in all of cinema, peerlessly beautiful
","Count Laszlo (Ralph Fiennes) has just been transferred to a hospital in Italy during World War II. He is horrifically burned from an ambush. His nurse Hana (Juliette Binoche) tends to him, body and mind, for she fears, quite rightly, that he may be a very troubled soul. In the course of his care, the Count starts to tell Hana of his recent past. It seems he worked in a government capacity in Africa, where he met a beautiful married lady named Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Although they tried to avoid each other, they fell in love. After a brief affair, Katherine called it quits, leaving the Count desolate. Even so, the two would meet again, under heart-wrenching circumstances. Meanwhile, Hana herself falls for a Sihk man in the British bomb squad. Yet, the war is raging relentlessly. Can love exist when the world is in turmoil? This is a tremendous film, based on an equally fine but complex novel. The plot has many story lines that are woven together beautifully, each of them poignant beyond description. The script itself is elegant and contains many memorable lines. Fiennes is magnificent, both as the burn victim and as the man who thought love was a myth. Scott Thomas is also quite fine as the woman who fights against her passions. As for Binoche, she richly deserved the Oscar that she was presented, as her nurse is a shining example of hope in a hopeless situation. The scenery is utterly gorgeous, as are the costumes, the direction, and the production. If you have missed out on viewing this film, rectify that soon, very soon. The English Patient will remain one of the greatest achievements in film for centuries to come.",10,98,138,7 March 2007
Public Enemies," Very worthwhile, especially with Depp as the star and Bale, Cotillard & Crudup offering great support
","John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) is very adept at robbing banks in the 1930's. He and his closest friends have done well, so well that they have a definite swagger in their steps. And, since they have executed successful jailbreaks a time or two, their skills are formidable. Naturally, this is most upsetting to the young director of the FBI, J.Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup), compounded by the fact that there are no laws to cover the crossing of state lines during a crime spree. But, JEH will press on. Enlisting the services of one very determined G-man, Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale), Hoover assembles his gang of 'go-to' guys. In the meanwhile, John has spotted a beautiful but poor gal in Chicago, Billie (Marion Cotillard) and insists that she become his woman. Bowing to his looks, wealth, and charm, she accepts his advances and the couple enjoys a brief interlude of romance. But, money does run out and John & Co. have to plan their next heists. They even join forces with Babyface Nelson for awhile. Can the 'public enemy' criminals escape the hand of the law forever? This is a very worthwhile film, especially for those who love action, gun battles and history. The casting of Depp as Dillinger is terrific, making it difficult to see anyone else in this role. But, Bale, Cotillard, Crudup, Leelee Sobieski, and all of the others are quite fine, too. Then, too, the re-creation of the Depression Era deserves much praise, for the sets, costumes, camera work, script, dialogue and direction all work well to fashion this bygone time in American history. One small comment to add is that it is pretty violent, so if you don't like a bit of blood and guts, stay away. But, then, its not excessively gory, either. Therefore, while it may not be the best film of 2009, it is hard to imagine anyone not being enthralled Public Enemies.",8,3,5,8 July 2009
The Other Boleyn Girl," Interesting period piece, with attractive stars and sumptuous costumes....worth a look
","King Henry VIII (Eric Bana) sits on the throne of England. His virtuous wife Catherine of Aragon, mother to Princess Mary, has just given birth to another stillborn child, a son. Sensing the king's growing discontent and fading love for his honorable wife, a key adviser decides it is time for the king to have a mistress. He calls on the family of his sister (Kristin Scott-Thomas) and her social climbing husband, Sir Thomas Boleyn. After all, they have two lovely daughters to offer. One, Anne (Natalie Portman) is beautiful and very clever while Mary (Scarlett Johannsen) is also fair, kind, and sweet but not as quick-witted. Oh, wait, Mary has newly been married to a country landowner so that leaves Anne. The father invites the king to his country estate so that the royal can get acquainted with his older daughter. However, on a foxhunt, Henry is injured when Anne, on horseback, leads the company into dangerous terrain that only she knows well. The king ends up bedridden and Mary is designated to be his nurse, as she is patient and adept at caregiving. Suddenly, Henry prefers Mary and, as he is the king, he moves the entire Boleyn household to court and makes the wedded Mary his mistress. Anne, greatly miffed and rejected, brews up some trouble for the sister she once loved well. But, is Henry through with Anne and devoted only to Mary? We shall see! This is an interesting period piece with a story that, somewhat familiar, deserves to be told again. Most folks have heard that Anne eventually married the king, gave birth to Elizabeth, and subsequently lost her head over some sort of controversy. But, here is a portrait, little known, of her much kinder sister who was also involved with the king, due to her father's insane scheming. As the principal players, you could hardly find a better looking trio than Portman, Johannsen, and Bana and they perform quite well. All of the secondary actors are superb, too, with Scott-Thomas spouting the best lines of the film, absolutely, in great style. Noteworthy indeed are the costumes, for they are sumptuous and worth the ticket price alone. There is also some nice scenery and excellent production values, while the script is interesting and makes history come alive. Most importantly, the film clearly shows that while feminism is a 'recent' phenomenon, women have had important roles in the world's turning since time began. If you are a fan of romance and adore period pieces, this one is definitely for you. Yet, even those who usually can't be bothered will, I predict, take a shine to this one, where the drama is heavy and the stars so wonderfully winsome.",7,8,15,29 February 2008
Black Book," Harrowing story, told very well
","Rachel is a young Jewish woman in Holland during the World War II occupation. She is in hiding with a farm family, hoping to avoid being sent to a concentration camp. However, the farm is bombed and she loses her hiding place. Knowing of a lawyer who is helping Jews in desperate need, she goes to him for money and advice. He tells her of a midnight barge that shuttles Jewish people to a safe territory. Late at night, Rachel meets up with the others, including her parents and brother, to escape to better circumstances. It is a trap. Everyone is ambushed and killed, with only Rachel making it out alive, by diving into the water. Finding and joining a group of resistance fighters, Rachel dyes her hair blonde and changes her name to Ellis. Her first assignment? Get 'close' to one of the SS officers and use her influence to end the executions of captured resistance fighters. In danger at every moment, Ellis tries her best. But, what other turmoil lies ahead? This is a fine movie but hardly an easy watch. Based on fact, the story of the Dutch resistance is one of hope amidst chaos and death. Rachel/Ellis showed tremendous courage in the face of evil and the actress playing her part is wonderful. The other cast members are equally fine, with special mention for the gentleman playing the SS officer. The sets, costumes, and production values are high, re-creating the wartime atmosphere with attentiveness. Be warned, however. Although it is not excessive, this is a harrowing tale of survival, with torture and death around every corner. Also, many resistance fighters were compelled to kill the enemy, making for painful and guilt-ridden memories. For those who are faint of heart, the film may be too much. Yet, if you want to experience history as it was, and LEARN from it, this is a great movie. If only it could be shown to those in war rooms across the globe. Surely, anyone who witnesses this account of man's inhumanity to man would seek peace straight away.",8,4,6,29 May 2007
"I Love You, Man"," I liked it, man, but I didn't LOVE it; however, it is definitely a blues-eradicator
","Peter (Paul Rudd) is a Los Angeles real estate agent and he's in love with the beautiful Zooey (Rashida Jones). He gets down on his knees at a prime piece of real estate, meant for Zooey's expanding business, and pops open the ring box. She happily accepts. However, as they plan the wedding, it suddenly becomes very apparent that Zooey has several close friends to stand up with her and Peter doesn't even have one close friend to be the best man. Yes, he connects with some of his fencing partners and a few work colleagues but, in general, prefers watching 'Chocolat' with Zooey and eating popcorn. When a poker game with Zooey's friend's (Jaime Pressley) hubby (Jon Favreau) and gang ends badly, Peter begins to think there is something wrong with him and his inability to 'hang out' with the male population. But, things can change. At an open house for Lou Ferringo's posh digs, Peter meets investment-counselor Sydney Fife (Jason Segel), who admits he came to the showing only to eat the free food and meet 'divorcees'. Liking Sydney's honesty and sensing that he may be a kindred spirit, Peter begins a friendship with Sydney and starts to 'loosen up'. After all, Sydney lives in a bachelor-pad-garage in Venice, filled with musical instruments for jamming to his favorite band, Rush and he has an offbeat style and humor that is very infectious. Could Sydney be Peter's best chance for a best man? This was a fun film, with great turns by Rudd and Segel. They definitely make the film better than the material, as the script is nowhere near as clever as Rudd's previous winner, Role Models or Segel's Sarah Marshall, either. But, that's not to say it isn't worth the time, it definitely can turn frowns into smiles, as the comedy is broad and universal. The supporting cast is also very nice, as are the California setting, the costumes, and the production values. Likewise good is the upbeat ending. Don't hesitate to see this one, for it is very likable. But, conversely, don't go expecting to be bowled over with laughter, as small grins and twitters are much more likely.",7,0,3,25 March 2009
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Lose yourself in this film, for any viewing will take you away from your present cares
","Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson) has a master's degree in journalism but is, at present, working for a Cosmo-type rag called Composure. There, she writes a monthly column of 'how-to', that is, how to talk your way out of a traffic ticket, how to feng shui your digs. But, she'd rather be writing on world hunger or something else equally important. One day, Andie helps a co-hort, with a recent broken heart, stop crying and make it to work on time. At the ensuing staff meeting, Andie's boss (Bebe Neuwirth) asks Andie about her next column. Having no concrete ideas, Andie decides to take up her fellow worker's dilemma that, perhaps, she drove her boyfriend away. How about a column called 'How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days'? Andie will pick out a nice guy and then drive him crazy, causing him to drop her like a stone. The boss lady likes, yes indeed. Later, at a couples bar, Andie sets her eyes on ad agent Ben (Matthew McConaghay). But, unknown to her, he has just taken a bet from his staff that he can make any woman fall for him in a week's time. As they draw each other in, the stage is set for an epic battle of affection between Andie and Ben. Who will win? This is a very cute movie with great-looking stars in Kate and Matthew. Supporting them is a nice cast, also, including a most funny combination of Adam Goldberg and Thomas Lennon as Ben's best friends. Lennon, especially, is a most underrated performer, for his dry wit is terrific and steals scenes easily. Neuwirth is always a hoot, too, with Robert Klein on hand to please the audience as well. As for the costumes, they are especially lovely, and the NY setting, production values, script, and direction are above average, also. In short, if you love comedic tales of love, get this one soon and lose yourself in its winning story of a loving competition of the sexes.",7,1,2,2 October 2007
Just Go with It," Just go see it, romcom and Sandler fans, and take some folks with you
","Dr. Danny (Adam Sandler) was jilted long ago, on his wedding day, when he overheard his fiancée telling her bridesmaids about her recent infidelities and non-love for Danny. Seems she only wanted security. Ever since, Danny, a plastic surgeon, has told any female interest who comes his way that he is married but getting a divorce, etc. This allows him to romance a number of women without getting involved. The one lady who has remained constant in his life is his personal assistant, Katherine (Jennifer Anniston). She supports him at work and with every trouble. However, she is a divorcée with two children to support so she is in search of a 'good man' herself. One day, Danny meets the young woman of his dreams, Palmer (Brooklyn Decker), a caring teacher 15 years his junior. But, after a night on the beach, she finds his wedding ring in his pocket and assumes he is a lying you-know-what. To make her realize he IS married and that he and his wife are having problems, he asks Katherine to 'pretend' to be his married partner and have a lunch between the three of them, so Palmer can verify that it is 'over'. But, naturally, a more complicated web springs forth, for Kate has to take a call from one of her kids at the end of the meal and now Palmer knows there are children involved. Soon, Danny has to arrange a meeting with Kate's whole family, but, the doctor has to bribe the kids into making it look real. Before long, everyone is off to Hawaii for a vacation, where Kate runs into an old back-stabbing sorority gal, Devlin (Nicole Kidman). So, now Kate 'pretends' that Danny is HER husband, so Devlin, married to a phone inventor, can see that a plastic surgeon is good fishing, too. When will the secrets tumble out and, could it be, that Danny may be developing an interest in Kate, much to his surprise? This very loose adaptation of Cactus Flower is a charmer. There are many funny lines and the cast is great, with the main principals and supporting actors doing fine work. No, Sandler is not a cookie cutter romantic lead but he is man of many talents, no doubt. Also, the scenery is wonderful, as are the costumes, with Aniston looking so good, you want to check her driver's license. Ditto for Kidman. The photography, script and direction are more than winning as well. If you are looking for a new romantic comedy, don't shy away from this one, you will be entertained. On the other hand, if you are a Sandler aficianado, you will find it right up your alley, too.",7,3,6,23 February 2011
Ed Wood," A terrific Burton film, which is why his latest flicks have been somewhat disappointing
","Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) is an underling at a Hollywood studio in the fifties. But, of course, he wants to direct his own films when he can get his hands on the money. One day, Ed is passing a coffin shop when he actually meets Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), whose prime has vanished, due in part to the former vampire's drug use. Nevertheless, Mr. Wood is thrilled and arranges to meet with Lugosi again. Ed's live-in gal, Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker) is not impressed, she would rather he have met Robert Taylor. Not long after this, Mr. Wood, who presents himself well in interviews, does secure funding from a D-list movie producer. While before its time, Glen or Glenda turns out to be a giant bomb. One reason is Ed's too rapid and careless direction and another is its subject matter, cross-dressing. But, even after a severe tongue lashing from the producer, Ed is not discouraged. He finds the money for his new production, Bride of the Atom, from a naive starlet who wants a starring role. This sets Dolores off, for she was promised the role, and she breaks off their relationship. Since Lugosi is the star, the film has more merit than G or G but not much. Lugosi, too, checks into a detox center where he manages to get off the needles. Mr. Wood meets a lovely lady there, Kathy (Patricia Arquette) who becomes his new love. Still, Ed goes on talking his talk, convincing a group of Baptists to fund another science fiction film, which will provide money for their future religious endeavors. Suddenly, Lugosi passes away. There are other huge production problems. Will Ed complete his masterpiece, Plan 9 from Outer Space? This summary of mine does not sufficiently portray this fantastic film about the real director, Ed Wood. It is rip-roaring funny and the cast is superlative. Depp, yes, is great as the title character but Landau is terrific and won an Academy Award. Parker, Arquette, Bill Murray, J.D. Spradlin, Jeffrey Jones, Tina Marie and all of the others are very fine, too. Shot in black and white, as Wood's films were, its presentation is likewise wonderful, with great art direction, sets, and costumes. One must also applaud Burton's visionary direction. Don't settle for tame entertainment tonight. Get Ed Wood and walk on the wild and wacky side!",9,2,2,14 August 2012
About Time," About time a romantic comedy arrived in 2013, there have been far too few
","Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) is surprised when his father (Bill Nighy) asks for a private chat on his, Tim's, 21st birthday. Well, it is rather important! That's because all male members of this particular family inherits a nifty aptitude on this all-important year. Now, Tim will be able to 'time travel' back to past years and relive, possibly change, certain happenings. Whoa, is this true? Yes indeed. At once, Tim remembers a dreadful New Yeat's party where the girl he was dancing with wouldn't kiss him, shaking hands instead. Ho, ho, going back, Tim smoothly works his way into a kiss! This is wonderful! But, wait, not so much. When Tim finally leaves his home estate in Cornwall to work as a lawyer in London, he longs to find the girl of his dreams. She soon appears in the form of Mary (Rachel McAdams) and, after a good first meeting, he records her number in his cell phone. Yet, when Tim goes to the flat he shares with a surly playwright, Harry (Tom Hollander), Harry soon tells him that his latest play, that very night, was a disaster, due to a key cast member forgetting his lines. Tim, wanting to help, goes back in time to prompt the actor, making the play a success. But, alas! When he goes back to his phone, Mary's number isn't there, for they NEVER met. Horrors! Doing some quick thinking, Tim remembers a detail of their conversation that helps him find her again. Nice! But, will Tim come to regard his ability as a blessing or a curse? This lovely film from the writer/director, Richard Curtis, of Four Weddings and Notting Hill, is a delight. Its funny, thought-provoking and touching. While Domhnall is not 'leading man' handsome or arresting, he does a fine job. McAdams, very beautiful, does wonderfully well as his love interest. Other cast members, including Nighy, Lydia Wilson, and the rest, do great work as well. Praise should go forth to the creators of the costumes, sets, and cinematography as well as a deep bow to Curtis for his, once again, extraordinary vision. The setting in Cornwall is strikingly gorgeous, seaside and fetching to the point of EVERYONE longing to go there at once. Have you, as a romcom fan, been feeling neglected, like me? Remedy that and see About Time. Its truly 'about time' that a movie like this comes to town.",8,4,7,14 November 2013
500 Days of Summer," Don't wait 500 days to see this wonderful film, for it only takes one day to acclaim it as a great look at the perils of 'true' love
","Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) once dreamed of being an architect but he now works for a greeting card company in the City of Angels. He is also a firm believer in romance and soulmates. One day, his boss hires a new personal assistant, Summer (Zooey Deschanel) and Tom is smitten from his very first glimpse at the dark-haired secretary. His friends and co-workers see his admiration almost immediately and tease him relentlessly but, fairly soon, Summer becomes friends with Tom. However, she makes it clear early on that she is only looking for a casual relationship, nothing serious. Nevertheless, Tom pursues a romance with the lovely Summer, for he believes he can convince her that they are meant to be a forever couple. They go shopping at Ikea together, hike up to their favorite lookout over the city, and see each other often. Tom thinks he has opened a floodgate when Summer actually has him over to her place. But, in a relationship where the level of attachment is so lopsided, can anything good result? This is a comical, sure-fire look at the heartache of unrequited love, one of the best ever. Tom is the epitome of all-consuming love generated toward someone who does not match his affections, not by far. But, its difficult to place blame on someone who makes his or her position known from the start. As the unlikely couple, Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel are terrific and all of the lesser cast members are great as well. In addition, the film is inventive and clever, even mixing a bit of animation into the fabric of the movie. What a surprise and a delight this is! The costumes, scenes, script and production values are also very worthy and the direction is surefooted and smooth, a difficult feat when the timeline jumps from past to present and other places in-between at every turn. It only takes one day to acclaim this flick as a top film of 2009 and it would make a wonderful, cathartic view for anyone who has had their heart pulverized, even if its only been a matter of weeks, for the movie also offers seeds of romantic hope for the scorned. Therefore, don't wait 500 days for a watch but make plans for a showing now.",8,0,2,8 September 2009
Juno," With a story and script that are light years above most others, don't put off a showing of this film, as I did!
","Juno (Ellen Page) is a sixteen year old student who lives with her blue-collar, kindly father (J.K. Simmons), her down to earth stepmother (Allison Janney) and her little half-sister, Liberty Bell. Although she is smart, funny and cute, she is not a member of the 'in-crowd' at school but exists on the fringes in her own unique way. A crush on a fellow classmate of the cross country team leads to a sexual encounter that leads, in turn, to an unwanted pregnancy. What to do? Her first thought is abortion but, once at the clinic, she can't follow through, as a classmate-activist tells her that even fetuses have fingernails. That leaves her with few real choices so, very sensibly, Juno tells her parents of the situation and informs them that she is already seeking a nice couple to adopt the baby. One day soon after, her father accompanies her to the would-be adoptive parents lush home. Upon meeting the Lorings, they seem ideal. Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) is a lovely businesswoman who confesses that she was 'made' to be a mother but is unable to have children of her own. Husband Mark (Justin Bateman), also, seems kind, intelligent, and 'cool', that is, he has a music room with classic guitars, etc., and he writes melodies for advertising commercials out of their home. A contract is signed and everyone begins to wait for the perfect outcome of Juno's pregnancy. But, will everything, indeed, be perfect or is reality about to come calling? This brief description can NOT convey the true wonderment of this film. Yes, this is an outline sketch of events but the awesome script, by Diablo Cody, that embellishes the story is so funny, the buttons of your own pants will come flying off between spasms of laughter! From the fellow science lab student who says she can't concentrate today due to a 'menstral migraine' or the convenience store owner chiding Juno for shaking her pregnancy test stick 'it's not an etch-a-sketch!', this is a screenplay that is lights years above most others. In fact, the great one-liners come so quickly that a second showing will be a requirement! Then, too, the performances are great, with the petite Page leading the way. But, the film is much more than a laugh or two, as it tackles a touchy subject, teenage pregnancy, and treats it lovingly, with humanity, dignity, and naked reality. If you have put off a showing of this film, for whatever reason, don't delay any longer! This is a film that, absolutely, confirms that life is worth living and that our connections to others are the means to help us through it.",10,3,7,12 April 2008
Yes Man," More of a 'yeah' instead of a definitive YES, but, thanks to Carrey and the other fine cast members, it is still enjoyable
","Bank loan officer, Carl (Jim Carrey) is in a self-imposed state of hibernation. Stinging from an acrimonious divorce, Carl goes to work each day but returns home immediately afterward and stays put, watching the boob tube. Even his friend, Peter (Bradley Cooper) can't get him to go out on the town and he is mightily ticked when Carl misses a pre-nuptial party for Peter's coming wedding. Yet, a chance encounter with an old friend leads Carl to an inspirational seminar run by Terrence (Terrence Stamp). With the word 'yes' as his mantra, Terrence urges his adult attendees to affirm life by dumping negativity, taking some chances, and refusing to say 'no' in social and work situations. Almost immediately, Carl's life changes. He takes a homeless man back to a city park, where he runs out of gas. But, amazingly, pretty Allison (Zooey Deschanel) is there to rescue him, offering him a seat on her motorbike and a ride to the nearest gas station. Carl likes what he sees and makes plan to get together with Allison again. At work, things change, also, to the delight of his British boss, Norman (Rhys Darby). Carl begins to give out more small loans and the company makes money, as folks gratefully make their payments, with interest, on time. But, in truth, is this a genuinely new Carl or just a temporary impostor, that is, is Carl's optimism real and enduring? This is an enjoyable film, thanks to the splendid cast. Naturally, Carrey deserves a great deal of the credit, for his facial expressions and physical antics are humorous and unique. Just watch him play a corpse, in a dream sequence, or tape up his face at work and you will be howling with laughter. He definitely carries this flick much farther than anyone else would have done. But, the supporting cast is quite fine, too, with Deschanel a treat as the spunky Allison, Cooper a nice second fiddle and Stamp a hoot as the inspirational guru. Then, too, the scenery in so-Cal is lovely, the costumes are inspired, and the production values topnotch. Therefore, the real weaknesses of the flick are its spotty script and direction, for the film has moments of high humor followed by blase bits of nothing. Yet, it still manages to come together at the finale, with gusto. If you are a fan of Carrey's, you will absolutely not want to miss him in action, he is one of American cinema's priceless treasures. However, if you just want to get out of the house and see something light and funny at the local theater, this is a good choice, yes.",7,3,4,29 December 2008
Midnight in Paris," A dream ride in a classic French automobile, a success for Woody and company
","Gil (Owen Wilson) is a self-described 'hack' screenwriter, successful, but longing for something else. His beautiful fiancée, Inez (Rachel McAdams) thinks their future life in Malibu will be just great. On a trip to Paris, with Inez' parents, Gil is entranced by the great city and the venues where the 'lost generation' of Americans traversed in the 1920's. Smitten, the writer wants to relocate there at once. Neither Inez or her parents are pleased. Things get touchier when Inez runs into an pedantic professor (Michael Sheen) and his wife and decides to needle Gil into hanging out as a foursome for a few. Finally, Gil has had all he can temporarily stand and leaves the party to walk home. As the clock tolls twelve, a classic Peugeot pulls up at the curb and the occupants invite Gil to their vehicle. He does. Soon, the car arrives at a party, only in a different era, with women dressed as flappers. To his astonishment, Gil meets Scott Fitzgerald, Zelda, Ernest Hemingway, and other transplanted Yankees. How can this be? Gil, learning quickly, becomes one of 'them', as he states he is a writer with a novel on the verge of publication. But, in the morning, he is back in modern times and still faces his problems with Inez and so forth. Their relationship is no better, prompting Gil to return, at midnight, to the same spot and wait for the elegant automobile to take him back to his dreamy new companions. Only now, there are others. He meets Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), who insists on reading his book. Also appearing is a beautiful model, Adriana (Marion Cotillard) who has been posing for Picasso, among other activities. Next comes T.S. Eliot, Salvador Dali (Adrien Brody, amazing), and various other writers, artists, and, brand new, film makers. Will Gil ever want to return to 2010? This is a lovely film with a fantastic premise, a great cast, and a beautiful setting. No, in my view, its not Allen's funniest, I prefer Curse of the Jade Scorpion or Mighty Aphrodite for more genuine laughs. But, that's not to say that Woody hasn't delivered another fine flick into his already overflowing arsenal of admirable achievements. His genius will shine through the ages. Wilson does a very noteworthy job as the film's conflicted star while McAdams, Sheen, Bates, Carla Bruni and all of the lesser cast members are well-chosen, too. Two thespians deserve special praise. Cotillard continues to light up the screen with her beauty, wit, and sensitivity. Such a change from Inception, here, but no less worthy! Then, Brody, with very little screen time, manages to knock everyone's socks off as the eccentric Dali, what a great and vastly comedic turn! Naturally, Paris is lovely, as the opening montage shows well and great costumes, an intelligent script and a careful direction complete Allen's opus. Wouldn't it be fun to see the film at midnight, so get the gang together for an all-nighter of fun and philosophical discussion!",8,3,6,16 June 2011
Milk," A very fine fictional film about the gay activist, Harvey Milk....Penn is great, too
","Harvey Milk (Sean Penn) is an insurance company employee who works in New York City. Although he is gay, his employer doesn't know it, for it is the late 60's and he could get fired. One night, he meets a handsome young man on the subway steps, Scott (James Franco) and it changes his life. First, although he is hours away from his 40th birthday, Harvey convinces Scott to spend the night with him. Then, the relationship extends itself, longer than a mere one-night stand, and Scott persuades Harvey to move to San Francisco and start their lives 'over'. Landing in a neighborhood that is home to other gay men and ladies, they open a camera store and begin a campaign to stop discrimination against gays in their corner of the world. Harvey quickly perceives that this will take some 'doing' and that it might be best for him to run for political office, as a supervisor for his neighborhood (akin to a city councilman). Assembling a great group of friends and colleagues as his political team, including young Cleve Jones (Emile Hirsch), Harvey runs and loses, the first time. Yet, Milk is not discouraged and he makes plans to run again. This upsets Scott, who wants a more placid life and the two part ways. Harvey eventually gains another partner, Jack (Diego Luna). Meanwhile, some violence is still directed at gays in the hood and, more importantly, a national campaign is brewing to strike down any laws communities pass or try to pass that prohibit gay discrimination in the workforce. This anti-gay movement is lead by such people as fundamentalist Christian actress, Anita Bryant. So, although Harvey eventually becomes a city supervisor and an inspiration to the gay movement in America, California fashions 'Proposition 6', a bill that would allow the firing of gay teachers, and puts it on the November ballot. Can Harvey and others see that this law is never a reality, despite some heavy handed opposition? And, will fellow supervisor Dan White (Josh Brolin), an priggish Irish Catholic upset with Milk's failure to back some of White's own ideas, make trouble for Milk, also? This is a very fine film about an admirable man, Harvey Milk, who was most instrumental in changing the lives of gay citizens in California and in the United States. Milk's fighting spirit and loving attitudes went a long way in his success at giving formerly 'closeted' gays a chance at a more normal existence. As Milk, Penn delivers another stellar performance that shines brightly. All of the other cast members, too, are quite wonderful as well, from Franco to Luna to Brolin and beyond. Special mention should be given to Hirsch, for he is splendid in his role as a young activist with attitude. The settings in California are lovely, naturally, and the costumes and other production recreations of the time periods are terrific, too. Director Gus Van Sant and the screen writers should also receive much praise for their telling of Milk's story without sensationalism or tawdriness but, rather, employing quietly revealing scenes of truth and great camera work. Especially, the viewer will be grateful that White's role is rather small, for although he eventually assassinated Milk and Mayor Moscone, his part is not allowed to detract from the film's focus on Milk and his admirable life and achievements. Quite a feat indeed. Although this movie may not be for everyone, especially those with strong religious beliefs, it is nevertheless a very worthwhile view. Therefore, if you are dedicated to watching films of a more serious nature, Milk should be on your list of must-sees.",8,0,3,9 February 2009
The Terminator," Terminally fascinating, terminally thrilling; may be Cameron's best work
","A dismal future seems to await mankind. Machines, including elaborate killer robots, have taken over the earth. There is, however, a small band of human survivors who are trying to regain control of the planet. They are doing rather well at this, on a small scale. So much so, that the machines send one of the best lethal robots (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to bump off a lady, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). This is because Ms. Connor is destined to have a son, John, who will become a great leader of the resistance. Guessing what is afloat, the humans send back their own time traveler, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to prevent this tragedy from happening. When the robot gets to 1984 Los Angeles, he grabs a phone book. Inside is a listing of three Sarah Connors and their addresses. Methodically, Arnold Robot guns down the first two. But, the one remaining Sarah is the one he learns he really wants. Meanwhile, Kyle shadows Sarah around, for he doesn't even know what the killer machine looks like and has to wait for the robot to make the first move. Hiding in a bar, Sarah knows something is up, having seen the news of the deaths already. Happily, Kyle rescues her at the last minute. From then on, there is an on-the-run fight to defeat and destroy the robot and no surety that the humans will do so. From parking garages, tunnels, motels, cabins, and factories, the terminator does not stop in its pursuit of its prey. Who will win? This film is terminally thrilling and terminally fascinating. It may very well be Cameron's best work, even including Avatar, Titanic, Aliens and others. As the killing machine, Arnold is absolutely perfect, cold, calculating, and more, moving stiffly like a robot would. Kudos, Arnold. Hamilton and Biehn are also quite good while the supporting cast, including Paul Winfield, backs them up nicely. The sets are fantastic, from the futuristic ones to the settings in Los Angeles. Ditto for the special effects, which are way ahead of their time. Moreover, the script is a stunning science fiction masterpiece while Cameron's direction has a relentless pace, pausing briefly for tender moments and, yes, romance. Have you missed the Terminator, believing it to be anything but a thinking man or woman's movie? Don't put off a showing any longer!",Null,2,3,6 October 2011
Sleepy Hollow," A dark, repugnant, gory film.....probably Burton's worst effort, in my humble opinion
","Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is a coroner for New York City in the late 1700's. He is constantly chiding the other coroners that scientific means should determine the cause of a person's death, not what first impressions may dictate. Consequently, the others send me him to Sleepy Hollow, New York, a Dutch-heritage town in upstate New York, where three people have been decapitated. The most ghastly facts are that their heads have not been found and that a 'headless horseman' is the one responsible for their murders. Ichabod scoffs at that idea, for he believes there must be a reasonable explanation for the murders. Of course, he is determined to bring the murderer to justice. But, once he gets to the town, he sees the horseman himself, in the act, and he is horrified. Now, four people are dead and. more importantly, how can this supernatural killer be stopped? Ichabod meets a bevy of folks to hatch some ideas, among them a beautiful, wealthy young lady named Katrina (Christina Ricci). Katrina tries to provide Ichabod with clues, even as others in town work to help him find the answers, too, for everyone lives in fear that he or she will become the next victim. Will Ichabod be able to end the killings? Now, first let me state that I believe Burton to be a great film director, as evidenced in Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, Batman, and Mars Attacks, among others. However, Hollow is dark and repugnant and, I believe, his worst film. It has an abundance of bloody scenes that are not scary, just repelling, and it has little comic relief, save for the fact that Depp faints from time to time, when things go badly. Yes, the art direction is quite good and so is the cast, including Depp, Ricci (looking very lovely), Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Christopher Walken, Jeffery Jones, Lisa Marie and other talented players. Yet, even they can not rise above the film's dark themes and gory scenes, all of which leave the viewer feeling tremendously cheated out of a good tale. I do not feel it does justice to the original story and it certainly will not please any movie viewers looking for a rousing spine-tingler. The best advice I can give is, if you like the cast and/or Burton, go ahead and see what you think of the results. As for me, I am dreadfully sorry I watched the film, as its excesses are most depressing indeed.",5,0,1,9 December 2007
Once," Once you watch this vibrant, melodious film, you'll probably want to see it twice or even more times
","An Irish busker (Glen Handsard) has had his heart broken. The lady in question moved to London and now he sings on the street corner, belting out songs of love gone wrong. Its not his only job, as he works part time repairing 'hoovers' at his dad's Dublin shop, which is also their abode. One day, on a Dublin street, a beautiful young lady stops and is so captivated by his performance. She gives him ten cents, which he laughs about, but the truth is, she is not wealthy. A Czech immigrant, this girl (Marketa Inglova) sells flowers on the street while her mother takes care of her young daughter. Yet, she also plays the piano and sings, which is why she is enchanted by the busker. Soon, when she learns he fixes vacuum cleaners, she brings her's to his shop and, later, the two stop in at a musical instruments store, where the owner knows her. Together, these two begin to make beautiful music together. But, there are problems. When the guy makes a pass at her, she tells him about her estranged husband, back in the Czech Republic, and her daughter. Meanwhile, the guy tells her about his former flame. Continuing to see each other and, finally, making a recording as a duo, is a platonic relationship really all there is to be? This lovely, very melodious movie is a gem. You may want to see it more than once! Hansard is already an established Irish singer, whose soulful ballads are a modern update of Irish folksongs. Inglova, too, is very talented and, together, they are dynamite. No matter that neither one is an actor, their work here is touching and true. Then, too, the scenes around Dublin are most beautiful while the photography is great as well. A good deal of the tunes are played while either the guy or the gal is walking, shopping, or otherwise engaged, making it different from other traditional musicals. Costumes, script and direction are all wonderful as well. So, here's the advice. Get Once at once!",8,1,2,25 November 2013
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Complex, atmospheric, intriguing, somber
","In seventies England, the Circus, the nickname for the British Intelligence Agency, has taken a hit. In Hungary, a top official was to give some important information to the Limies. But, something went wrong and folks ended up dead. Therefore, the leader, Control (John Hurt) is asked to step down and so is his right hand man, George Smiley (Gary Oldman). However, it becomes apparent that they were wrongly blamed for another government official suspects a 'mole', a double agent. On the sly, this man comes to the retired Smiley and asks him to re-enter the Curcus quietly, to seek out this traitor. At first, Smiley is very reluctant, for his dismissal stung. Yet, he agrees to do it. Traveling from Hungary to Russia to other venues closer to home, Smiley learns how to untangle a very elaborate web of deceit. Along the way, George hears of lovely Russian ladies who risked their lives to help, logs that have pages ripped out, and former spies hiding in plain sight as school teachers. Can he do so before other lives are lost? This film is a quietly impressive work but, it is so complex that one would need to view it multiple times. The cast is a large asset, with Oldman leading the way indeed. Colin Firth, Hurt, Toby Jones, Ciaran hinds, and many others give great performances, too. Also, the movie has an atmospheric quality that has to been seen to be appreciated. It re-creates the seventies well and shows that most agents try to stay as 'invisible' in their jobs to the point of blandness until a crisis occurs. Yes, there are various settings, too, but sometimes these are not the best the countries featured have to offer. Most importantly, the story is worthy of much praise, in its twists, turns, and revelations. An ending scene, where an agent is gunned down silently, is most sensational. One must honor the director, too, for taking a difficult book and bringing it to life. All in all, here is a film for those who aren't afraid to watch a tale that has hidden depths.",8,1,2,2 July 2013
Dear John," Dear Nicholas, Dear Lasse, thanks for giving us such a lovely film!
","John Tyree (Channing Tatum) is on leave from the U.S.Army's special forces. It is the summer of 2001 and he has returned to his father (Richard Jenkins) and home on the Carolina coast. On the beach one day, a group of young adults are horsing around and a purse falls in the ocean. It belongs to beautiful Savannah (Amanda Seyfried) and she is upset over its loss. Without hesitation, John dives into the water, finds it, and returns it to her. She is happy, although one of her companions, a male with an interest in Savannah, is less than content. Nevertheless, from that moment, the two begin a tentative relationship. John tells Savannah that he will be out of the army in about a year and asks that she wait for him. Although they only share a few kisses, the young couple are in love. However, they part, vowing to write to each other often. Complicating things is the fact that John's dad is autistic, relating poorly to the community, and so is the son of Savannah's attractive neighbor, Tim (Henry Thomas). Savannah communicates well with each of them but John does not. Then, 9/11 occurs and John feels he must re-enlist, knowing his unit needs him. On a very brief leave, Savannah and John spend a few precious hours together. But, then John is gone. What does their future hold? This is, surprisingly, a most lovely film and worthy of praise. A story that could have been melodramatic and trite is, instead, genuinely moving. The cast is quite nice, with Tatum and Seyfried making a fine couple, while Jenkins and Thomas deliver especially notable turns. The scenery, costuming, production values, and Nicholas Sparks' tale are good as well. Most importantly, Hallstrom 'mixes things up' and uses some very interesting camera shots and scene arrangements to deliver a film of great style. Dear viewer, don't think this is another teen flick with little to offer for the general public. On the contrary, most fans of romantic drama will find it enthralling.",7,7,10,16 February 2010
The Adventures of Tintin," It would be a sinsin if Tintin was awful, which its not, but despite being visually stunning , its good, not great
","Tintin (voiced by Jamie Bell) and his loyal dog Snowy are sitting for a portrait in Paris. Behind them, clever folks are pickpocketing a good deal of the crowd. After taking delight in his picture, Tintin finds something else to love. It's a model ship and its selling for a song. Strange what happens next. Just as the lad makes the purchase, not one but two gentlemen try to buy the ship from its now owner but Tintin won't do it. He takes it home, finds out its name and goes to the library for research. When Tintin and Snowy return, the ship is gone! This leads to finding the estate of the original ship's owner, another model, and the kidnapping of Tintin and his dog! Soon, they are at sea and the captain is after a part of the model that Tintin didn't know he lost! The lad escapes with a drunken sailor and goes hither and yon, trying to get back to Paris and avoid the nasty men who are after him. Will a boy and his dog have the advantage? They will when they are as smart as these two! There's really nothing so bad about this film, so the director, Spielberg, hasn't committed a sinsin. But, it is complex and not really a younger children's flick at all. That said, it is sensational to look at, with a design that is bright and colorful. Also, the actors voicing the characters, including Bell, Daniel Craig, Simon Pegg, are first rate, too. The film also starts off quite action packed but loses a bit of steam in the middle before finishing nicely. Especially fine is a scene where an opera singer shatters the glass of everything in sight. So, older kids and folks that are young at heart, especially longtime fans of Tintin, will like it. But, it has to be called good, not great.",6,0,0,3 December 2013
Knocked Up," Very funny, very incisive look at modern existence but, for those who like their fun good and clean, pick another film to see
","Allison (Katherine Heigl) is a rising star in the entertainment television news business. Having just been promoted to an on-camera role, she is ready to party hearty and celebrate. Her sister, Debbie (Leslie Mann) is glad to help out, so the two of the them get dolled up and head for a trendy nightclub. Once there, Allison goes to the bar to buy some drinks but she has difficulty attracting the bartender's attention. Enter Ben (Seth Rogen). He helps Allison by arranging for her to get her beers without delay. Allsion is grateful and heads back to her table. Ben also returns to his circle of friends, where his pals chide him for not making more of a play for the obviously beautiful Allison. Bolstered by their suggestions, he approaches Allison again and they make a connection, albeit one that works better because of Allison's growing intoxication. They somehow end up spending the night together. But, in the morning, reality rears its ugly face. Allsion is a pretty lady with a great job and Ben is a consummate slacker with no ambitions or desire to change his present circumstances. Although they go their separate ways, fate throws them a curveball. Eight weeks later, Allsion learns that she is pregnant. Is there any possible future for Allison and Ben, that includes a baby? This is a very funny film, although the humor is as eyebrow-raising as it comes. The cast, quite large, is very nice, with Rogen doing a great job as the less-than-perfect suitor for Allison. Special mention should also be extended to Paul Rudd for his simply tremendous performance as Debbie's husband, a performance of humor and empathy. The whole production looks great, with well-picked costumes, scenery, and photography. Again, the script is the true champion here, as the story shines a bright, probing light on the realities of marriage, casual sex, money, and success. Although one would have to say, in the final analysis, that the film's conclusion is unrealistic, it is a very upbeat one, indeed. In essence, this is the brave new world of romantic comedy, told from the male perspective, as exhibited in such films as The 40 Year Old Virgin. As such, it is supremely funny and insightful but, if you prefer fun that is good and clean, you should pick another film, for this one treads into the limits of raunchiness.",7,9,19,30 May 2007
Begin Again," Begin your week with this lovely, melodic film ...or find time in the middle or end, anytime is great!
","Dan (Mark Ruffalo) was once a top music producer. He especially excelled in finding new talent for the company he co-founded. But, that was then, this is now. Not having discovered new artists for several years, his partner had to take more power in the company's direction, leaving Dan in a position to be fired. Also, his marriage is shaky and so is this man's relationship with his fifteen year old daughter, Violet (Heilee Steinfeld). Meanwhile, rising singing star Dave (Adam Levine) has traveled to Manhattan for a lucrative contract. With him is his longtime girlfriend and song-writing partner, Greta (Keira Knightley).

To cheer her up, Steve takes her to a small nightclub where he is performing. Before long, he prods Greta into singing a song on stage, too. Guess who is in the audience? That's right, Dan!

Asking favors from other musicians Dan has discovered, the musical talent scout and the lovely lady from Britain start recording an album in the open air all over the city. When they are finished, they hope to strike it BIG! Will they? This lovely, very melodic movie is a great pleasure to watch. First, the cast is first rate, with Ruffalo, Knightley, Catherine Keener, Steinfeld, Cornin, and many others. Especially impressive is Levine, who has a thankless role but plays it very well. In addition, his voice is magnificent, while Knightley's renditions are beautiful, too. The setting is fun, the costumes fetching, the script heartfelt and the direction lively. Anyone will appreciate the interesting and varied shots of the action and the backdrops for the musical numbers. if you've been putting it off, don't! Begin your week with this flick, find time in the middle or end with it on the weekend. It has charms for every day of the week, month, and year.",9,1,4,22 July 2014

The other lady is a younger woman, from the United States, who is in a loving relationship she thinks will last forever. Their lives all become entangled and turned upside-down throughout the course of the film. Will anyone find happiness? This movie is just spellbinding. The four actors, Owen, Law, Roberts, and Portman give touching, realistic performances as the flawed but undeniably attractive characters. The settings are lovely, the costumes fetching and the script is very truthful and compelling, even thought the language and situations get a bit rough at times. Are you a film fan who must see every top-notch film that is released? Do find this one, you will not want to miss seeing a movie at this fine a level of film-making.",9,1,2,2 April 2005
Shutter Island," Don't shut yourself out from this beautiful film! It's a masterpiece, marred slightly by an imperfect edit, but still very fine indeed!
","Teddy (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a federal agent sent to investigate the disappearance of a female inmate at a prison for insane criminals. Located off the east coast, the island is accessible only by ferry and is surrounded by icy waters and a rough, rocky coast. Going with him is 'green' agent Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) who will be working on his first major case. When they meet the security officers on the island, Teddy and Chuck are dismayed to have to surrender their weapons but the facility's rules rule. The chief trick cyclist, Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) explains that their goal is to rehabilitate these folks, for, although they committed assaults and murders, they can be reached by therapy and pharmacology. Whew. The person missing is Rachel (Emily Mortimer), who disappeared while orderlies were having a card game. But, where did she go? She left behind her shoes and the terrain of the island is difficult. There is no explanation, so far. Another doctor (Max Von Sydow), a German immigrant, upsets Teddy, for the agent was part of the American army that liberated Dachau. Unhappily, Teddy begins to have horrific flashbacks. Also troubling Teddy is recurring nightmares about the death of his young wife, Dolores (Michelle Williams) in a fire. As they begin to look for the missing person, they have to inspect all three buildings on the island, including 'C', where the most dangerous inmates are housed. Will they find the lady? Will they lose their own lives doing so? This is a masterpiece, slightly flawed, but an major achievement in film nonetheless. A better edit would have made a difference, for the pace is slightly off kilter and a 'mixing and splicing of scenes' would have resulted in more interesting sequences. Nevertheless, Scorcese should be commended for making a thriller that genuinely thrills, and a beautifully, artistically crafted one at that. For example, a scene that falls apart into ashes is out of this world! The setting itself is a reason to see this one, for it is one of a kind. All other production values, including costumes and camera-work, are of the finest. On that note, DiCaprio and Ruffalo look so good in fifties-style coats and hats! The cast, too, is superlative, with all of the principal players doing great work. Special mention should go to Leonardo, for he is terrific and demonstrates why he is one of the premier actors in America. In short, get thee quickly to this amazing film. It is an overwhelming thrill ride of beauty and imagination.",9,1,4,24 February 2010
Life of Pi," Gorgeous imagery and deft direction aid the telling of a complex story
","Pi (Suraj Sharma as a teen, Irrpan Khan as an adult), has quite a story to tell a Canadian writer (Rafe Spall) when he comes calling. As it were, Pi was named after the longer word for swimming pool, Piscine, in French but an obvious, objective nickname became the norm until he demanded to be called Pi. His father and mother ran a small zoo in their Indian city and loved swimming pools, too. Pi got in dreadful trouble one day when he attempted to feed a Bengal tiger through skimpy bars. His father and mother made him watch the animal, named Richard Parker, long story, kill and eat a goat, as a lesson. Pi understood quickly the power of this beast. Later, due to financial difficulties, the family decided to move to Canada, where they would sell the remaining animals, including RP. Alas, on the boat, where the cook (Gerard Depardieu) belittled their vegetarian needs, a storm arose. A Japanese vessel, everyone sunk except Pi, Richard P, a zebra, a hyena and a monkey. These five managed to make a lifeboat, but because of the laws of nature, soon the only ones left were Pi and the tiger. For awhile, Pi hooked up a few life rings, by rope, to the small boat, whenever Richard Parker didn't get enough to eat and was on the prowl. Miraculously, this went on for weeks but when would they be rescued? Would they be? Bravo, dear Ang Lee, for making a film out of a complex novel, albeit a great one. There is much talk of religion and other philosophical matters in the book, as the story unfolds, and a great deal of this is captured. The first part, where the family life in India appears, is lovely, with great scenery and acting. Once on the waters, too, the imagery is likewise fantastic, as the story turns to the fight for survival. There are also flashbacks to the present, where the older, married Pi tries to elaborate any peculiar details. The acting is also wonderful, with no familiar stars except Monsieur D, in a rather small role, but no matter. All are compelling. The varied direction is enchanting, with its use of cutting techniques to keep the viewers involved in the action. Alas, I chose not to see this in 3-D at the theater, what a mistake of the decade! But, even on a small screen with no bells and whistles, this is an enthralling piece of cinema.",8,1,3,17 April 2013
Tangled," Sing out for Tangled, its adorable. As for composer Menken, the man is a rare earth commodity, needs a Nobel made for him
","Princess Rapunzel (Mandi Moore) has been locked up in a tower since she was a baby. That's because Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) stole her away from her royal parents shortly after her birth. Why did she do so? Because a magic flower that restores youth was given to the pregnant queen, since she was gravely ill, and Rapunzel's hair now has that magic, with the help of a special song. The young lady's only companions are her 'adopted' mother and a darling little chameleon, Pascal. However, through the tower's windows, Rapunzel has seen that lanterns are launched on and only on her birthday. A coincidence, maybe? Perhaps. In any case, the Princess wants to go outside the Tower for her 18th birthday present. But, Mother Gothel won't hear of it. She sings a song about the perils of the world, from poison ivy to quicksand, and tells her daughter NEVER to ask such a thing again. Disappointed, Rapunzel tries not to cry. The next day, when MG leaves to gather dinner fixings, Rapunzel is surprised to find a young man, Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) has scaled the Tower's wall to evade the Palace Guards. Flynn, you see, has stolen a crown, and is in trouble. Never having seen a man before, Rapunzel manages to knock him out with a pan and lock him in the closet. Thinking quickly, when Mother returns, the Princess sends MG away on a hunt for white dye, a three day journey. Its Rapunzel's plan to ask Flynn to show her the lanterns and, indeed, the world. It begins well. Mother leaves, Flynn helps the Princess down and the vacation starts. But, all too soon, MG returns, surmises what has happened, and is hot on her daughter's trail. Of course, she is not alone, as more men are chasing Flynn, too. Time after time, the duo is in peril. Will they escape and will Rapunzel learn who she truly is? This outstanding film is so adorable that every viewer will, in turn, sing out its glories to the next potential fan. Moore, Levi, and Murphy are terrific in their important roles and they can warble like the most melodic of birds. The supporting cast is fine, too, as is the animation, script and direction. As for the music, it is so exquisite that a special Nobel prize should be created for Menken, the composer. He is one rare earth commodity and he is ours, an American. (The lyrics are also quite nice). In short, untangle your feet from the couch cushions and go get Tangled at once. What a treasure it is!",9,2,4,19 December 2011
Doctor Strange," Strange, strange; has its merits, including Cumberbatch, and its minuses
","Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) has a big problem with egomania. A top neurosurgeon in NYC, he does work miracles but, his ego is enormous. Needless to say, his attitude prevents others from liking him, including another surgeon, Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) who the doctor seems to admire. Yet, pride goes before a fall, as they say. One fateful night, Strange drives too fast in his hot sports car, while talking on the phone, and he crashes. It's horrendous. Yes, he's alive, but his hands are badly damaged and to a surgeon, that's the universe. After extensive physical therapy, his hands remain shaky. Desperate, he learns that a paralyzed man now walks again, after a trip to Nepal. With his finances extremely low, Dr. Stephen nevertheless takes the trip to the faraway land, searching for The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton). He almost doesn't make it until he is saved on the street by Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor). What luck! Mordo is also trained in the mystical healing and brings Dr. Strange to his supreme teacher. Strange's ego is still inflated and The Ancient One has to be convinced to offer him hope. After studying chakras, amulets and other long-forgotten abilities, Doctor Strange is reborn. However, not to surgery, as there is a more pressing matter. A former apprentice, Caesillius (Mads Mikkelsen) of the Ancient One is causing tremendous problems on earth. Dr. Strange's first mission may be to try and stop this formidable foe. Can he do it with the help of Mordo, The Ancient One, and another mystic named Wong? First, I do not watch many superhero movies as they are not my preferred view but, finding Cumberbatch a very compelling performer, I chose this one. Mr. Benedict does not disappoint, as he is a very handsome and talented actor. Likewise, the other thespians are first rate, especially Swinton. But, I was hoping to see a movie where a superhero uses his unique powers to rescue average folks and, somewhere along the way, get the girl. This does not happen. In addition, while the special effects may have been better on the big screen, on my paltry 20 inch they were busy, confusing, overworked. In other words, they did not enhance the tale for this viewer. Perhaps there will be sequels, where Doctor Strange has a chance to save the world and romance ladies at the same time. Til then, its a mixed bag of entertainment.",7,1,2,27 March 2017
We Are Marshall," Fairly standard fare but very touching, nonetheless
","Marshall University, in West Virginia, experienced a tragic loss in 1971, with an airplane crash that killed its football team, coaches, and friends. This based-on-fact film opens with the final game played by the team in Carolina and the ensuing plane ride home. The flight goes down near Huntington, West VA, where the university resides. It is a fiery crash with no survivors, and the town and university are in subsequent turmoil. In the days ahead, the university's president (David Straithorn) has to decide, among other things, whether the football program should be suspended. However, a few remaining players who did not make the final game's trip, due to injuries, want very much to continue and so does the student body. Therefore, they hire Jack (Matthew McConaughay) to put the team back together. Coach Jack receives special permission to use freshmen in the season ahead and assembles a ragtag team of walk-ons as well. Assistant coach Red (Matthew Fox), who was not on the flight, makes a gut-wrenching decision to return to the team as well. Can this new team help relieve the sorrow of the university community and compete with more established teams? This is a very uplifting film, despite its rather mundane delivery. The cast has been well chosen, with Fox giving an outstanding performance as the lone surviving coach of the downed team. The football scenes are exciting and true to life. That said, the production values are okay but the look of the film is not always top of the line. Costumes are, appropriately, the now-funny garbs of the seventies and the setting in West Virginia a mixture of beauty and industrial ugliness. But, despite these quibbles, the story is a heart grabber many times over. The resolve of this new team to bring hope and encouragement to a community in turmoil is very touching. If you like football and true stories, do find this film. Tears may cover your face, at times, but you will take a new dose of courage and determination back to your own daily life.",6,3,4,23 February 2007
Barry Lyndon," A masterpiece, Thackeray would undoubtedly be dazzled himself with Kubrick's work
","Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) is a son of Irish parents who, while not wealthy, are fairly comfortable and semi-sophisticated. Unfortunately, Redmond's father has died and his mother and he live in a large family house with cousins and such. One female cousin, Nora, is Redmond's first love, as she, somewhat older, is not yet married and a definite flirt, even with a young relative. Finally, the family makes a match for Nora with a British officer but, Redmond challenges the man to a duel, where Redmond is the quicker draw. Thinking his rival dead, Barry's mother gives him a stash of guineas and urges her son to go elsewhere until things cool off. Unknown to Redmond, however, is the fact that the officer was hit with a non-lethal bullet and survives to marry his cousin anyway. More bad luck follows, as Redmond is robbed on the road of his money and horse and has no other choice but to join the British army. At first happy with the food and benefits of the Redcoats, Redmond's first real battle changes that contentment, as the horror is revealed. Thus, Barry makes plans to assume the identity of a fallen soldier and escape. It seems to go well in the beginning, as Barry meets a beautiful young German widow (he is in Prussia at the time) and spends a few lovely days with her. All too soon, his lies are revealed and he is pressed into the more severe Prussian army, for a number of years. From there, he becomes a small-time hero, meets up with a professional gambler who, likewise, wants to escape to a new venue and, eventually, our Redmond finds himself in the same social circle as a most beautiful aristocrat, Honoria (Marisa Berenson). Honoria is a married lady, with one young heir, but her well-connected and older husband is very ill. Sensing Redmond's attentions to his wife are more than friendly, the lord's anger at the situation hastens his death. After the 'proper' mourning of a year, Redmond marries Lady Lyndon and assumes the name of his wife, too, becoming Barry Lyndon. In almost no time, the two are at odds with one another and this upsets the family's heir (Leon Vitali) to the point where he loathes his new stepfather. Although Honoria welcomes a second son, Bryan, who is spoiled by his doting father, Barry's situation is precarious, as his mother points out, on a visit. The death of Lady Lyndon who be a disaster for Redmond and his son, as the true heir would kick them out of their glorious mansion and render them penniless. Is there another way to get a title, so that Barry can stay in the posh circles of life? With his life a series of good luck, bad luck, nothing is certain, n'est-ce pas? This is a motion picture masterpiece, based on the literary classic by William M. Thackeray. The story is sensational and Kubrick chooses a narrator to help move the tale, as it is a long one. Then, too, the cinematography and the director's avid attention to the details of the time period, including scenes shot by candlelight, make it a sumptuous view. Costumes and sets are beyond description. The actors, somewhat secondary to this, are nevertheless quite fine, with O'Neal giving an uneven but stirring turn. Berenson has less to do than look lovely but her character's nature is weak and she shows it. Vitali is sensational as the brooding heir and Patrick Magee and all of the other, lesser names give it their all. I, unfortunately, waited 35 years to watch this stunning, impeccably-crafted film. Don't do likewise, rent it ASAP.",10,2,4,21 April 2011
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Powerhouse film, serious themes, not for all
","Mildred (Frances McDormand) has had a rough life. Her ex-husband was abusive but after the divorce, he still lives in the same town. More importantly, her beloved daughter was raped, burned, and murdered in cruel fashion. This was six months ago and there have been no arrests. The sheriff, Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) and his erratic deputy, Dixon (Sam Rockwell) have done their investigations and there are few new options. Nevertheless, Mildred believes her daughter's case is being filed and forgotten. Therefore, when she drives down a little-traveled road near her town of Ebbing, Missouri, she spies three billboards ready for new ads. Plunking down a cool $5000 of her own money, she asks the advertising company to put up questions relating to her child's murder, goading the sheriff's office. No, Willoughby is not happy. For a spell, television crews come and focus on Mildred's cause. But, no leads emerge. Meanwhile, Willoughby is seriously ill with cancer , making some of the townfolk turn against Mildred. All this while Milllie's ex-husband is parading around with a 19 year old girlfriend, her son has difficulty at high school, the town's dwarf (Peter Dinklage) wants to date Millie, and Deputy Dixon has a love-hate relationship with his mother. Will a killer be brought to justice? This powerhouse film is strong and serious but is not for all. For one, the language is profane quite often and there is violence, too. Some viewers will not be comfortable with these two matters. On the other hand, the cast is superb, with McDormand and Rockwell leading the way but with all cast members contributing mightily. The setting is rustic and unusual while script and direction are complete treasures. There are valuable lessons and entertaining hours to be taken from Three Billboards. Give it a try why don't you?",8,1,4,4 March 2018
The Grapes of Wrath," Everyone should see Grapes of Wrath and be thankful for what they have!
","In rural Oklahoma, Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) is walking and hitchhiking home from prison, after a stay of four years. After taking a knife at a dance, Tom hit the attacker with a pan, killing him. Nevermind that it was self-defense, Tom still gets sent to prison. He hasn't heard from his parents, Ma (Jane Darwell) or Pa because they aren't the 'writing types'. A fierce dust storm makes Tom's final few steps treacherous. Arriving back at their small cabin, where his family are sharecroppers, Tom and his passing friend, Casy (John Carradine) are startled to find no one at home. A shell-shocked neighbor informs the other two that the family has been kicked off their land in foreclosure. They are nearby at Uncle John's house, where his family is about to suffer the same fate. Its the Depression and the Dust Bowl has ruined the land, taking off the top soil; no one can grow crops. When Tom catches up with his Ma and company, they are overjoyed to see him, for their plans are to pack a truck and move to California, where handbills show pickers are needed. Grandpa doesn't want to leave the only home he has ever known, so they drug him with medicine and haul him along. Now on the Mother Road, route 66, the journey is difficult; the truck breaks down frequently, no one wants them to stay long anywhere they rest, and Grandpa dies of a stroke. Will California really be the Golden, Promised Land? NOT ON YOUR LIFE! This heartbreaking adaptation of Steinbeck's classic is a must-see for the whole wide world. This family of hard-working folks has one calamity after another, just trying to earn an honest and living wage. Those who lived in the Dust Bowl part of the country were hit especially hard, as the soil had been overworked and winds took the topsoil off, creating damaging storms to crops, humans, and animals. No better were the 'lies' of the handbills, advertisements that migrants were needed in California, where over 300,000 poor helpless folks showed up for very few jobs. The cast, with Fonda at the helm, is wonderful as is the scenery, costumes, and careful direction to show the truth of a desperate situation.

Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Magnificent ending to a great film series; or is it the end?
","Rey (Daisy Ridley) is training on the secretive resistance safe haven planet with General Leia (Carrie Fisher) while Poe and Finn barely succeed in an operative. Meanwhile, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) has felt a disturbance in the force and goes looking for a Sith finder to gain access to the hidden Dark Side planet. It is there that Kylo learns that the Emperor Palpatine has raised himself from the dead using the Dark Side and has been running the first order from afar since its inception. They discuss Rey and Kylo promises to turn her at last to the Sith side and present her to the Emperor. As such, Rey also senses the same disturbance and comes to the conclusion that she, too, must get her hands on a Sith finder (there are only two in existence) and find out what's what. As the gang of Rey, Chewy, Poe, and Finn go to strange new worlds, the First Order has a traitor in its midst, giving them important clues. Also, Threepio, along for the ride, has valuable info in his being but, because of his programming to never reveal Sith information, the only solution is to find someone to exrtract the hidden data illegally. There is also, very importantly, new information about Rey's parents and grandparents. When Kylo and Rey finally meet, what side will be victorious? This superlative film has it all; great cast, grand story line, sensational settings, amazing art direction, fantastic special effects and a solid direction. Special mention in the cast should go to the return of Billy Dee Williams as Lando and newcomer but polished actor Richard E. Grant as the new general of the First Order. Also amazing are the glorious new creatures and alien beings which are delightful. Yes, there is a definite ending to the tale but is it really the last installment? What about the little guy with the broom at the end of The Last Jedi? We shall have to see if this truly is the last hurrah or not. In the interim, go, go, go, go multiple times to Rise.",10,1,2,8 January 2020
The Devil Wears Prada," The She-Devil returns, only this time its Meryl, in an enjoyable movie
","Miranda (Meryl Streep) is at the helm of a Vogue-type magazine called Runway. She is indeed a prickly, over-demanding creature who lives and breathes for herself and the magazine only. Enter Andrea (Anne Hathaway). She is an aspiring journalist who takes a job as Miranda's assistant only because she hears Miranda's name opens future doors in abundance. Andrea is not fashion gaga and she learns later that this is the reason Miranda took a chance on her. But, given the close exposure to the dragon lady, Andy begins to change. She does begin to bask in the designer duds they get as gifts and starts to neglect her boyfriend and friends when Miranda is summoning her. But, does power corrupt absolutely and does it reach those circling the powerful one? This is an interesting movie about the fashion industry. It is obviously a cutthroat business where the players come prepared to dedicate themselves entirely or get out of the way. Streep is terrific in a totally unflattering role. Hathaway is also fine as the naive young woman who learns many lessons in integrity and ethics. The supporting players are also nice, with Blunt giving a great turn as the assistant ready to sell her soul for the she-devil. It goes without saying that the costumes are of the finest and that the NYC setting is always spectacular. If you are an aspiring model or fashion designer, this movie should be required viewing. But, for anyone who wants to experience the dog-eat-dog world behind the loveliest clothes on the planet, this film will have you glued down on your chair.",7,1,2,30 September 2006

Her troubled and careless mother, Helene (Amy Ryan) left the child alone in her second floor apartment for at least an hour and, thus, the girl vanished. Now, the whole city and the neighborhood of Dorchester, is looking for Amanda. In three days, nothing emerges. Very frustrated, Amanda's aunt Bea (Amy Madigan) and her husband Lionel (Titus Welliver), this latter being Helene's brother, ask private detectives and significant others Patrick (Casey Affleck) and Angela (Michelle Moynahan) to join the search. Reluctantly, they do. Police officer Remy (Ed Harris) and his superior, Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) bristle at the addition of the private eyes. Yet, Patrick and Angie immediately turn up clues that Helene lied and is not telling the whole story of her shady, coke-snorting life. Then, too, another child goes missing and notorious kid molesters are back in Boston, somewhere. Will Amanda be found? Alive and well? This monumentally dark film is very fine. The story, based on the superb book by Dennis Lehane, is a repugnant, heart-wrenching, all-too-real tale of woe. As such, director Ben Affleck has kept and darkened the tone, with shots of the downtrodden, ugly persons and venues of Dorchester. There are very few light moments while the cast recreates splendid roles with great skill. MOST IMPORTANTLY, the moral ambiguity and mighty issues that are at the core of the movie will have viewers discussing it till the cows come home and back out again. No, its not a happy film but dedicated movie fans won't want to bypass it.",8,0,1,7 January 2019
Ant-Man," I'm late to the party! Very enjoyable, great cast and special effects are mind-blowing
","Scott (Paul Rudd) has been in prison for a year or so. He is an accomplished thief who, alas, got caught. This very much upsets his relationship with his young daughter, Madison, who still adores her biological dad. Nevertheless, she also loves her new stepdad (Bobby Cannavale), a policeman, and her mother (Judy Greer) and lives happily with them. One day, astonishingly, Scott receives information that his sentence is commuted. But, there are strings. A famous scientist, Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) has requested his services in a serious heist. Pym, you see, has invented a special suit, Ant-man, which allows the wearer to shrink to various sizes, mostly that of an ant. But, an unscrupulous underling, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), who Pym fired, is also brilliant and has perfected the technology himself with knowledge gained from his former boss. Pym is a good guy while Cross has no problems selling his invention to the evildoers of the world, for a high, high price. Therefore, Scott is needed to shrink down and steal the parts that make Cross' operations work. It's dangerous. Meanwhile, Scott is also distracted by Pym's lovely scientist offspring (Evangeline Lilly), who has been secretly working against Cross. Can Scott pull this risky mission off and will he ever see his daughter again? This highly entertaining film has a, first, a strong cast. Rudd has his comedic 'nice guy with baggage' role down pat while Douglas is very fine in his secondary part. Lilly, Cross, Cannavale and the rest are also quite nice. Especially funny is the trio of ex-cons who aid Scott in his new life. The script and direction are strong, too. Above all else, the special effects are mind-blowing, with journeys back and forth between the natural world and the microscopic. What a treat for the eyes! In short, these Ant-ics are not to be missed!",8,0,0,16 November 2017
Bridget Jones's Diary," The ultimate antidote for the singles' blues, ladies, do pop it in the tube whenever you need it!
","Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) is headed to her parents' home for a New Year's gathering. Again, she is going alone, with no boyfriend in tow. Once there, her parents re-introduce her to an old childhood friend, Marc Darcy (Colin Firth), who is divorced and a hot-shot, human rights lawyer. However, Marc insults Bridget, accidentally, and Bridget sees him as a stuffy, boring gentleman, too. So, a romance between the two of them seems mighty improbable. Back at her small apartment, Bridget gets a bit tipsy but makes a New Year's resolution to keep a diary. It will record the doings of a thirty-something, biological clock-ticking lady in London. Soon after, book publicist Bridget receives some overtures from her handsome but lothario-like boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant). Unbelievably, Daniel takes a shine to Bridget and they begin a 'thing'. Yet, this leave-it-to-Cleaver has wandering eyes and Bridget is about to be on the receiving end of his infidelity. Horrors! On the upswing, Bridget and Mr. Darcy, that is, Marc, meet time and again, by happenstance, and their icy feelings for each other appear to go through a semi-thaw. Is it likely that 'our Bridget' will find true love in the early 21st century? This is a wonderful movie and a true antidote to the cares of the world, especially for women everywhere. Most of us, like Bridget, are insecure, a bit overweight, and clumsy at love, among other things. Therefore, it warms the heart to see the underdog succeed. As the main character, Zellweger is nearly flawless, exhibiting high humor, a sunny nature, and self-deprecation in perfect pitch. Then, too, Firth and Grant are likewise terrific as her love interests; in truth, no one could have played these roles better, either. All of the secondary actors, Jim Broadbent, Gemma Jones, Shirley Henderson and the rest, are quite fine, too. As for the setting in London, it is lovely, as are the nice costumes and camera work. Above all, the script, based on Helen Fielding's best-selling book, and the skilled direction are to be greatly admired, for they absolutely capture the essence of the unhappy, aging-by-the minute single woman in her thirties. If you were to keep a diary of your own movie views, dear reader, do make certain you include BJD as an entry. In fact, it is one of those films to watch whenever a spiritual 'pick me up' is needed.",9,0,0,5 January 2009
Fargo," Tantalizing film, superb cast; the violence will be a bit much for some viewers
","In wintery Minnesota, Jerry (William H. Macy) has big problems of his own making. Secretly deep in debt, he has few options, although he is married to the daughter of a very rich man, Wade (Harve Pressnell) and works as the manager of his father in law's car dealership. Wade dislikes Jerry, you see. Desperate, he turns to two seedy characters in Fargo, recommended by an auto mechanic, to kidnap his wife, forcing Wade to pay up. The trio will split the proceeds. One of the would-be nappers, Carl (Steve Buscemi) is a non-stop talker with a loose cannon. The other (Peter Stormare) is a blonde menacing giant who says hardly anything. A car from Wade's lot will be the operation vehicle. Almost immediately, there are problems. Huge ones. A highway patrolman pulls the vehicle over, as it still have dealership plates. As Carl starts to reason with the officer, the giant shoots the cop. They drag his body to a ditch. Not only this, a young couple sees the crime from their car and a high speed pursuit ends in their deaths, also. Now, a small city police officer, Marge (Frances McDormand), six months pregnant, must find the perps for these deaths while Wade, frantic, tries to negotiate for the life of his beloved daughter. Meanwhile, Jerry sinks deeper and deeper into lies and deceit. Despite Marge's pregnancy and small town roots, can she solve these crimes? This tantalizing film has a superb plot, careful direction, and an eye and ear for snowy venues and upper Midwest conversation. In addition, the cast is fabulous, with Macy, Mcdormand, Buscemi, Stormare, and all others pulling off performances of great power. Don't forgo Fargo, even though it has some rough violence. The film's magnitude is richly deserved.",9,0,0,18 July 2018
Burn After Reading," Not a comedic 'scorcher' but very intriguing just the same
","Osborne Cox (John Malkovich) finds himself seriously demoted at the CIA. After all he's done for the country, he gets taken down because he happens to drink a 'bit too much'? Fuming, Cox quits the cloak and dagger business and decides to write an autobiographical expose of the spy game. His wife, Katie (Tilda Swinton) is aghast at his decision but needs to run to the grocery for cheese to serve at their cocktail party. Coming to the affair will be her secret lover, Harry (George Clooney) and his author-wife. Harry works for the Treasury Department and, unknown to Katie, he is juggling several extramarital 'things.' Meanwhile, Chad (Brad Pitt) and Linda (Frances McDormand) are much-poorer employees for a capital fitness chain called Hardbodies. Linda wants plastic surgery in the worst way, four different procedures, in fact, that up to thousands of dollars and her medical insurance won't pay. Chad is sympathetic, so when they find a disc at the gym, which happens to be the rough draft of Cox's tell-all, they decide to engage in a little blackmail. But, can these two less-than-brilliant fitness trainers really tread water in the vast ocean of espionage? We'll see, even as all of these players cross paths on the way to hush money! This is a lively, intriguing film which, nevertheless, may not be the Coens best work but which is certainly far above the Hollywood grind-em-out machine. The Coens have a great knack for creating memorable characters and this film is replete with them. From Pitt's wacky, dimwitted exercise nut to McDormand's lovelorn, aging fitness instructor and back to Clooney's needy, unfaithful government agent, here is a cast of characters to savor. Malkovich, Swinton, JK Simmons, Richard Jenkins, and all of the other lesser players are quite fine, too. The setting in Washington D.C. has been shot with care, showing the city at its best, and the costumes are very well selected. All of the film's production values are nice, too. Lastly, although the film doesn't quite come together for a 'big finish', the writing and direction make the viewer swoon with admiration for the brilliant minds that create such stuff. So, although it is not a 'scorcher', Burn After Reading is the kind of flick that gets everyone fired up about film-making.",8,1,5,20 September 2008
Baby Driver," Pedal to the metal ! Fantastic ride, great cast, superior soundtrack
","Baby (Ansel Elgort) has a tragic history, His mother and father were killed in a traffic accident when he was about ten and, as a teen, he once stole with Doc's (Kevin Spacey) fancy auto with a big pile of cash inside. This made him in deep debt to the older man, who is a criminal gang leader. Thus, Baby now drives the getaway car on the gang's many heists in and around Atlanta. The young driver is enormously gifted behind the wheel, earning the grudging admiration of fellow gangsters Buddy (Jon Hamm), Darling (Eisa Gonzalez), and Bats (Jamie Foxx) among others. Doc says its 'one more ride' and the debt will be paid. Baby is elated, especially when meets beautiful waitress Debora (Lily James) in a rundown diner. Also happy is Baby's aging foster father (CJ Jones), a deaf man who has longed for Baby to get away from crime. Yet, once Baby has been freed, gets a job for Goodfellas pizza and makes plans to take Lily away, Doc comes blackmailing Baby into one more job. Its a theft of a post office and things go wrong almost from the start. Needing fresh guns, Bats, Buddy and Darling go to a junkyard to pick them up from Butcher (Paul Williams, what fun), where things go terribly awry. Now, Baby may have to battle foes and pseudo-friends alike to stay alive. Can Baby and Debora drive into the bright sunset? This fantastic film is a bit rough, yes, for some folks. There's no sexual situations but there is some fairly bloody violence. It is rated R, after all. But, the tale is so enormously entertaining that its hard NOT to hitch a thrill ride. The cast is likewise wonderful, with Elgort a darling as Baby and Hamm, Gonzalez, Foxx, Spacey, James, Jones, and everyone doing great work. What a treat, too, to see Altanta in the rearview, with the camera turned to beautiful and seedy spaces. As mentioned, the script is glorious and the direction, both by Edgar Wright, is light-speed action. Most importantly, the eclectic soundtrack is one of the best ever. Baby yourself, baby, and drive out to catch this one.",8,4,8,15 July 2017
Knowing," Knowing that others, like me, adore Proyas and Cage, DO see this one but there are some flaws, definitely
","John (Nicolas Cage) is an astro-physics professor at MIT. He is also a new widower, with a pre-teen son named Caleb. The two of them live in a lovely old home, in the Boston area, with a wooded area in back. One day, John goes to Caleb's school for a visit, for it is an important occasion in the establishment's history. Fifty years ago the students drew pictures of their predictions for future life and buried them in a time capsule on the school's grounds. Today is the day to dig up the object and view the contents. As each student is given a sealed envelope containing the picture of a former student, Caleb is shocked to discover that his package has no picture, only a bizarre string of numbers. After showing the sheet to his father, John is baffled, too, until he begins deciphering the codes. It seems that within the lines of digits, there are the dates of many natural disasters on earth, with an exact number of victims, including one for 911. As there are three strings of numbers which have not 'occured' yet but which may be happening very soon, will John be able to prevent the next disaster? And, what about the girl who wrote this strange information on paper? Was she herself clairvoyant or was someone or something giving her the information? First, let me state that Proyas' Dark City is a monumentally great film, one for the ages, and that his The Crow and I, Robot are great films, too. However, this movie is not on their level, despite having a thought-provoking and complex plot and an art direction that is first-rate. Why is this so? Its hard to put it into words. First, the cast is fine, but is definitely not the reason to see the film. Cage starts off well, for he is a great actor, but there are times when his performance seems 'forced'. This fact alone hurts, as Cage is one of the finest actors of our time and my personal favorite. Rose Byrne and the lesser cast members do not enhance the film's value but don't detract from it either. The one bright cast member is the young boy playing Caleb, for he has an eerie, 'otherworld' look that is spooky but he also is quite touching as the confused soul in a changing world. In his favor, Proyas has fashioned a beautiful looking film, with amazing sets, costumes, art direction and special effects. Scenes of a plane crash and of a subway derailment are spectacularly effective and the atmosphere of the film is downright scary, at times, due to Proyas carefully constructed camera angles and heart-thumping music choices. So, ultimately, the true problem of the film is not necessarily Proyas, but the story and script. It just doesn't 'hang together', being one part mystery, one part science fiction, and one part family drama. Sad. Yet, for all of the criticism that the film will receive, it is still worth the viewing, for the ideas expressed are tantalizing and will make tongues wag for hours after a show. Therefore, if you love Proyas and Cage, like me, or science fiction in general, DON'T skip it. It may be flawed but its still an eye-popping film with plenty of stimulation for the mind and the heart.",7,5,10,30 March 2009
Hugo," Quite beautiful, a film where 'images are everything'; could have used a sharper edit, however
","Hugo (Asa Butterfield) is an orphan in Paris around 1930. His father (Jude Law) died in a tragic accident and several weeks ago, the lad's rather good-for-nothing uncle passed, too. Wanting to keep the news of his 'home alone' status a secret, especially from a train station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen), Hugo continues winding the large station clock, something his uncle was hired to do. Naturally, the young boy has resorted to being a pickpocket and a fruit snatcher to survive. Gifted mechanically, Hugo steals tools from a toy shop owner, Georges (Ben Kingsley) and, one day, is caught with a five finger discount. Very upset, the grouchy toyman takes away Hugo's prized notebook, a gift from his late dad. Terribly distraught, Hugo makes several attempts to reason with the old man. Fortunately, M. Georges has a ward, a girl named Isabelle, who is about Hugo's age. She wants to help Hugo in his endeavors. Well and good, thinks Hugo. But, M. Georges has many secrets, and the closer the young pair get to them, the angrier the toyshop owner becomes. He is even somehow connected to an automaton which Hugo's father was trying to restore. Also, although the Inspector has caught the admiration of a pretty flower seller (Emily Mortimer), he continues to haul young orphans off to institutions. What are the secrets of M. Georges? Will Hugo uncover them before he is caught in the inspector's net? First, this quite a beautiful film and such a change from Scorsese's last brilliant effort, Shutter Island. Although I was not fortunate enough to view the movie in 3-D, the scenery is breathtaking and the camera shots are equally so. Also, the cast is remarkable, with Kingsley, Butterfield, Mortimer, and particularly Cohen, enlivening the happenings. The story is also strong, especially its eventual glimpse into the world of silent cinema. Therefore, the film's weaknesses are its slow pace and far-from-sharp editing. Yes, Scorsese probably found it difficult to 'slice away' beautiful images, but the flick would have benefited if he had. But, by no means should you skip Hugo. Its riches can be enjoyed by the entire family and everyone will bask in the bountiful imagery that is indeed, head turning.",8,8,10,16 January 2013
Duck Soup," Souper and just ducky, too....thank you, dear Marx Brothers!
","In the country of Freedonia, a wealthy woman insists that Rufus Firefly (Groucho Marx) become the new leader. She pays most of the country's bills and has her eye on dear Rufus. Firefly accepts the position at an evening's gathering when he slides down the ballroom's firepole. There, he also insults the ruler of the neighboring country of Sylvania and starts a disagreement that may end in the two countries going to war. Naturally, everyone wants the dirt on Firefly and thus two gentleman (Chico and Harpo Marx) are chosen to spy on the new leader. Chico opts to run a peanut stand just outside the government mansion, bothering Firefly so much that he offers Chico the position of secretary of war. Chico is glad to oblige, stating that he wants a standing army 'so that we can save on the cost of chairs.' Harpo is always hanging around, too, trying to break into safes and get the scoop. One night, they all end up in nightshirts, nightcaps, and big black moustaches, mixing things up nicely. Firefly also holds government meetings where a member of the cabinet wants to take up the topic of tax. Firefly says they should take up the carpet but the man insists they 'take up tax (tacks) first.' Firefly concedes this to be necessary. As war looms, the trio prepare themselves for battle. What will the outcome be? Everyone probably has their favorite Marx brothers film and this one, despite the silly plot, should appear on many a list of their best works. They excel in mayhem, one-liners, and zany comedy. Duck Soup, therefore, shows off the Marx brothers unique talents that will never be duplicated, and will give the world a dose of laughter for the rest of time.",10,1,2,27 January 2007
Silver Linings Playbook," More like platinum instead of silver, a real treasure
","Pat (Bradley Cooper) is, at present, in a mental institution in Baltimore. He lost it, you see, when he came home from work and found his wife in the shower with another man. After beating the heck out of the male cheater, Pat's wife also has a restraining order out on him. Nevertheless, Pat is convinced that he is going to get his 'ex' back and without medication for his obvious bipolar condition. After 8 months of therapy, Pat's mother (Jackie Weaver) does get permission to take her son home to Philadelphia. Problems continue, however. Pat's father (Robert De Niro) has his own anger issues and is running an illegal business out of his home. Dad doesn't understand his own son's situation very well and doesn't have much patience. Especially when Pat Jr., reading a book, gets so upset he throws it out a window, breaking the glass. Meanwhile, some longtime friends (John Ortiz and Julia Stiles) decide to throw a dinner party and invite Pat and the wife's young widowed sister, Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence). If it is an attempt at matchmaking, it doesn't go well. Yet, slowly, Pat and Tiff do become friends, even to the point of swapping impossible requests for each other. Tiff wants Pat to be her partner in a dance competition while Pat wants the beautiful widow to get a letter to his ex, even though its against the law. As Pat Sr. places a large bet on the dance exhibition and his beloved football team, the Eagles, the stakes are high, especially for the mental health of Pat and Tiffany. Will there be a silver lining for all? This beautiful, touching movie should be rated in platinum, as its value is more than silver or gold. Its serious issues are mixed with humor and sweetness, making for a very enjoyable view. Then, too, the direction and editing are spectacular, offering many imaginative changes of scene. Above all, the performances are amazing. Cooper displays great talent in his role as the complex Pat while Lawrence acts years beyond her tender age to shine as Tiffany. De Niro, Weaver, Stiles, Ortiz, and the rest of the supporting cast are mighty nice, too. Kudos, especially, should go to Chris Tucker for his fine turn as a fellow mental patient of Pat's. The scenery in and around Philly is both lovely and gritty while costumes, make-up and photography are very worthy, too. Yes, the finale is a bit too pat while there is some bad language thrown about, too. But, all in all, get in line soon to buy tickets for Silver Linings. It is one of the finest flicks of the brand new year.",9,3,7,2 January 2013
Van Helsing," Part horror, part hoot....stunning visual effects and a slyly comic performance by Jackman
","Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is a monster hunter who achieves results, through luck and weaponry. When he is sent to take down, once and for all, the evil Count Dracula, it is an all out war with the denizens of the count's castle, including Frankenstein, werewolves, and vampires by the dozens. Only Anna (Kate Beckingsale), a young noblewoman whose brother was changed into a vampire by Dracula, is on Helsing's side. How in the world will the two of the them win out? Part horror, part hoot, this movie is a fun watch for an evening. Jackman is just right as the monster hunter with the sardonic wit of a stand-up comic. Beckinsale is a more serious but worthy supporting cast member. The film is visually stunning, even in an age of computer generating effects. Just watch a lady vampire swoop down and scoop up prey or a werewolf change in the moonlight. Younger children should probably not watch the film, for it has scary images. But, teens and adults will hardly be afraid for long, as Jackman cuts everyone down to size with his words. Recommended for a something-out-of-the-norm movie for a night without a full moon.",6,0,1,21 December 2006
The Men Who Stare at Goats," The consummate 'soda pop' film; fizzy at the beginning, flat at the end
","Bob (Ewan McGregor) is a newspaper reporter who lives in Ann Arbor and is married to his longtime sweetheart. However, one day, his wife jilts him for the paper's editor. Heartbroken, Bob accepts an assignment in war-torn Iraq. While waiting to enter the country, he spies a contractor, Lyn (George Clooney) at a poolside restaurant in Kuwait. But, ho ho ho! Lyn is not really a businessman but an army agent of secret operatives. His main strength, as he tells it, is his 'jedi' training, which includes visions and mind-control. Although he won't reveal his present mission, he agrees to take Bob to Baghdad. Of course, things go wrong from the get-go, as Lyn is a bad driver who hits an enormous rock and wrecks the car. Waiting for a rescue, the duo is, instead, captured by the enemy and in dire straits. Can Lyn's powers really execute an escape? In the meanwhile, the 'jedi' relates the story of his training to Bob. It was oddball Bill (Jeff Bridges) who recruited him for this 'new age' military operations. A Vietnam veteran, Bill sampled everything from hallucinogens to Native American mythology to martial arts to formulate a well-rounded technique. Trouble was, Larry (Kevin Spacey), as a jealous member of the team, often put a spanner into the works. But, never mind that. Can Lyn still work miracles? This is one of those 'soda pop' films which start off with a great deal of fizz and go completely flat. No, its not the cast, for they are very fine indeed, as Clooney, McGregor, Bridges, Spacey and company make the most of every line. Also, the concept of the film is good, as are the costumes, scenery and the like. But, the script, which begins so well, ends up going nowhere until it reaches a ridiculous sort of finale. What a big shame! Even so, there are flashes of brilliance and some great one-liners. Therefore, if you like the cast members or 'different drummer' type films, you might take a chance on the DVD. Interesting failures are, at times, good for a one-time view.",6,1,4,13 January 2010
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Your mission, if you love fine ensemble casts, clever plots, and great sets, is to see this movie soon
","Somewhere in Belarus, secret, secret agent Ethan (Tom Cruise) and his sidekick Benji (Simon Pegg) are trying to stop a plane from taking off with a dangerous cargo. It's tricky. Our Ethan has to jump on the plane and trust that Benji gets the computer systems to open the door. Whew, that was a close one, as Ethan parachutes away with the weapons cargo. Is it just another day in the life? Yes. But, not long after, Ethan goes into a record store in London, expecting to receive his next mission but, instead, is kidnapped by another secret, nefarious agency, The Syndicate. Meanwhile, Ethan's boss (Jeremy Renner) has failed to convince HIS superior (Alec Baldwin) that this covert arm of the CIA should still be in operations. It's shut down, so there won't be a rescue team for Ethan. However, just as EH is being pummeled by the enemy, a beautiful lady operative, Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) works to free him, at risk to herself, for she has infiltrated the enemy and can't blow her cover. Naturally, Ethan is NOW after the Syndicate. This takes him to the opera in Vienna, the mountains of Morocco, and back to London again. Mr. Hunt will need help from all of his friends, plus Luther (Ving Rhames), Ilsa, and the Prime Minister of England (Tom Hollander) to bring down his enemy. Can he really do it, specially since the head of British Intelligence may be a turncoat? This fine action flick, the fifth in a series, has many wonderful assets. First, the cast is just great, with Cruise slipping into his part in a fine ensemble without any obvious attempts to keep the camera on him. Well done, Mr. Cruise. Pegg, Baldwin, Renner, Hollander, Rhames, Simon McBurney, and all the rest each contribute to the flick's success. Ferguson is quite a find, a newcomer who recalls the beauty and fire of Catherine Zeta-Jones. Then, the settings are stunning, of course, with a wonderful scene backstage at a live production of Turandot, where body blows accompany the superb arias. In addition, there's the motorcycle chase on a coastal highway in Morocco that is out of this world. Naturally, the opening sequence with Cruise hanging on for dear life as he waits for the plane's doors to open is breathtaking. I could go on, but I won't. The story, also, is a clever tale of two Rogue Nations, one for good and one for bad, and includes technology that most can follow. So, what's really not to like? Your mission, and you NEED to accept it, film fans, is to make time for Mission Imp.",8,2,5,2 September 2015
Shrek Forever After," If this is indeed the last, it does what all good finales do, leaves 'em begging for more!
","Shrek (Mike Myers) and his wife-ogress, Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) have settled into domestic bliss. They live in their wee cottage in the woods, with their darling, burping baby ogre triplets. Each day is pretty much the same as any other, as the happy couple feed their children, take out the soiled nappies, and deal with repairs. At supper, they break bread with their good friends, Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas). But, one day, at the triplets first birthday party, Shrek reaches a breaking point. Why he, Shrek, used to scare villagers with his roar and reek havoc and now he's changing diapers? So, he walks out and heads to the home of Rumplestiltskin. What the frustrated ogre wants is ONE day to be his old, fearsome self. Rumpy is happy to oblige, for he always has a contract with fine, fine print. Thus, when Shrek signs the agreement and happily goes off to scare a few towns, he doesn't realize that he has given Stilts the power to erase the day he, Shrek, was born and complete a long-ago contract he almost made with Fiona's parents to take their castle in exchange for finding their daughter a husband. Got that, everyone? So, in a very short period of time, Shrek is captured and held prisoner at the castle that is now Rumpy's, Donkey is a beast of burden for the dwarf's witchy companions and Fiona has become the fearsome leader of an underground liberation movement against the midget. Only another 'true love's kiss' from Fiona will make things the way they were. Will it happen? This is a fun fourth sequel to the original and quite imaginative in animation and dialogue. The cast is wonderful, as always, with Myers, Diaz, Banderas, Julie Andrews and the rest doing fine work. Especially noteworthy is Murphy's turn, for he is just flat-out great as the fast-talking, excitable donkey. Then, too, the look of the film is gorgeous, with vibrant color and excellent animation, a true visual treat. As for the storyline, it has plenty of zest and originality and works characters from the fairy tale repertoire into its situations with ease. What child or adult, after seeing Rumplestiltskin, the Pied Piper, and Oz's witches, wouldn't clamor for the originals? That, of course, is the hidden treasure of the Shrek series, for the flicks invite viewers to get those volumes of folklore off the shelves of the library and into their hands and minds. Therefore, do make plans to see this new entry into the world of Shrek. If it is indeed the last hurrah, it does what good finales do, leaves 'em beggin for more.",8,6,8,7 June 2010
Dark City," Dark city will shine on in the annals of film history!
","John Murdock (Rufus Sewell) wakes up one day in the bathtub with no memories of who or where he is. It seems that a group of people who dress in dark garb have been experimenting on human minds and, in John's case, something went terribly wrong. As he gradually pieces his life together, John must confront a horrible possibility. Is he a serial killer or merely the husband of beautiful Emma (Jennifer Connelly)? And, why is nearly everyone, from policemen, to doctors, to these mystery men (aliens?), trying to get rid of him? And, is there a reason it always night, with no daylight ever breaking through? This is, indeed, a monumental film in every way. The plot is a knockout, like a mirror that has been shattered and must be put back together again, piece by piece. And, the style! The art direction and cinematography is so amazing that mere words could never suffice. The dark clothed people are creepy and the earth they have altered is shadowy and sinister. The final battles between good and evil are, literally, out of this world. Sewell is perfect as the man who may or may not be a killer but is certainly determined to find out his identity. Sutherland, too, is especially wonderful as the doctor who may have sold his soul out to the dark side. Do not hesitate to watch this film in the near future. It is landmark film-making that must be included in anyone's list of the greatest movies of all time.",10,1,4,18 August 2006
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Its complicated and scary, at times, but still rather fantastic, haha
","Newt (Eddie Redmayne) arrives in New York with a bulging suitcase. All too soon, we learn why. Inside the carpetbag are 'fantastic beasts', that is magical creatures unknown to earth. One slips out and its like the dam has burst as Newt runs to catch him while others escape. Meanwhile, in the city, there is a battle between wizards (one is Colin Farrell) and other magical beings and those who hate them, like Mary Lou (Samantha Morton). Caught in the middle is muffin-maker Jacob (Dan Fogler) who sticks by Newt to help battle the dark forces. From Central Park to Fifth Avenue, Newt and his gang have adventures to collect all the fantastic beasts and go back to England. Will he succeed? To explain the plot is quite difficult, so this viewer is not going to try. Suffice to say it has many twists, turns, ups and downs. Redmayne is sweet as the bumbling but caring Newt while Morton is absolutely scary as the evil Mary Lou who abuses the children she adopts on the pretense of saving them from the magical beings. Farrell is also great as the powerful wizard with a secret while Fogler is a total delight as film's comic, bewildered baker. Yes, too, the sets, costumes, and special effects are smashing. If you love fantasy, you shouldn't skip Fantastic Beasts.",8,0,0,26 November 2018
No Strings Attached," Say 'yes' to No Strings, romcom fans; those with other preferences will like it, too
","Emma (Natalie Portman) has always been on the reserved side, not comfortable with wearing her emotions on her sleeve. Even at sleepaway camp, where she first meets Adam (Ashton Kutcher), she has a difficult time consoling him when he admits his parents are divorcing. Later, when they meet again at a college frat party, she fails to extend a strong gesture of friendship toward Adam, despite their attraction for each other. Unbelievably, they meet a third time, when Emma moves to Los Angeles to complete her residency. Talk about fate! At this point, Adam's own father (Kevin Kline) has stolen away his former girlfriend and, once again, needs a hug or two. So, Emma puts forth an 'agreement' between these two very comely folks. Could they just sleep together, no commitments, until someone better comes along for Adam? Or, until one of them starts to 'feel' more strongly about a future relationship, when they can end it? Adam, who is still lovesick, agrees. Because Emma's schedule is so complicated, they meet for trysts at the drop of a hat. Sex is great. But, with Adam's friends (one is Ludicrous) giving him advice and a co-worker, Lucy (Lake Bell) showing interest in Adam, too, will he be the first to leave Emma behind? And, what about the arrogant young doctor who blithely tells Adam that Emma is his? This is quite a nice romantic comedy but its R rating, for language and sexual content, may not sit well with some viewers. As the tentative lovebirds, Portman and Kutcher are wonderful and so, so attractive. Kutcher, especially, gives a more understated performance than his usual goofball stuff, which is touching. The supporting cast of Kline, Ludicrous, Bell, Cary Elwes, and others is topnotch as well. The California setting is lovely, the costumes are terrific, and the camera work, script, and direction have plenty of style and smarts. In short, dear romcom fans, say yes to No Strings Attached very soon. Drag along others who are skeptical, too, for they will also like it.",7,2,6,27 January 2011
Enchanted," Some 'enchanted evening' is here for young and old romantics alike
","Gisele (Amy Adams) lives in a little cottage in her animated world. Her only friends are the tiny woodland creatures who help her around the house. Yet Gisele insists that a handsome prince will come, as she sings about her 'true love's kiss'. Prince Edward does come soon after and they fall in love, fairy-tale style. The next day, as Gisele is coming to the castle in a wedding gown, ready for the ceremony, her soon-to-be mother-in-law, Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) disguises herself as a hag and pushes Giselle down a 'wishing well' to the land where 'there are never any happy endings'. That would be New York City, of course. (The Queen does this so she does not have to give up any regal power). Gisele comes up through a manhole and into heavy traffic and confusion. But, someone soon comes to her rescue, a handsome lawyer named Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his little girl, Morgan. Robert is about to marry a no-nonsense lady named Nancy and he is utterly befuddled by Gisele, who breaks into song on a walk in the park and who does not even have a driver's license. Even so, he can't help but notice her beauty and her sunny nature. Can fairy tales happen, even in Manhattan? This is an enchanting, lovely movie from the talented Disney company. First, it has a nice combination of animation and real life that works seamlessly well. Secondly, it has some new, wonderful songs by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz, including 'True Love's Kiss', 'Happy Working Song', and 'That's How You Know', some of which should be nominated for Oscars. And, thirdly, the cast members are very well-chosen, too, with Adams making a beautiful, songbird princess, Dempsey showing he is a natural choice for a 'real world' prince, and Susan Sarandon giving a great turn as the evil queen-stepmother. Naturally, the production is enchanting, too, with gorgeous costumes, scenery, and cinematography. Therefore, if you are seeking a nice, family film for the little princesses at your house or are one of the true romantic souls of the earth, do not delay another afternoon. Some 'enchanted evening' is here this holiday season, just for you, at the nearest cinema multiplex.",8,2,2,24 November 2007
The Duchess," Bow deeply to The Duchess, for this beautiful film is a celebration of the true life story of a beautiful and remarkable woman
","Georgiana Spencer (Keira Knightly) is of marriageable age in olde England. Her parents, especially her mother (Charlotte Rampling) are delighted that she has caught the eye of the extremely wealthy Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes) and she is under consideration to become his wife. Basically, the Duke has two requirements for his future partner, that is, she must be attractive and she must be very fertile. Providing an heir to his fortune is of utmost importance to this man. After assurances of family genetics, the match is made. 'G' is astonished and happy to become the Duke's wife, for she has high hopes for a loving marriage. Alas, the Duke proves to be a cold fish who is more interested in his dogs than in his wife, and, apart from an occasional trip to the bedroom, he ignores his young and beautiful spouse. Then, too, although Georgiana proves herself capable of bearing children, two young daughters survive while two sons are stillborn. This is a bitter pill for the Duke to swallow and he brings a mistress into the house, Bess (Hayley Atwell) and expects G to accept the situation. Meanwhile, all of society loves the young Duchess, for few can resist her beauty, charm and wit. No one realizes the unhappiness of her life away from society until she meets an old friend, Charles Grey. In him, Georgiana sees a man who could bring her true love and affection. But, even though the Duke is permitted his dalliances, will he allow his young wife to do likewise? Hardly! This is a beautiful film which celebrates the true life story of the beautiful and remarkable Duchess of Devonshire. In her era, women were the ultimate 'trophy' wives and were expected to aid their husbands in society but remain strictly under their thumbs at the same time. If sacrifices were required, the women were asked to make any and all of them, even ones that seemed impossible. Naturally, this was a tall order for intelligent and sensitive women like Georgiana, and sometimes sorrow was the result. As the young royal, Knightly is wonderful, exhibiting a totally new performance that shows the great depth and breadth of her acting abilities. Fiennes, too, in a completely unforgiving role, brings such a vast amount of complexity to his part that viewers can not dismiss him as merely a thoroughly loathsome individual. The other actors, including Atwell and Rampling, are all very fine as well. The scenery in London and the English countryside is most inviting and the costumes are astonishingly opulent and of award winning caliber. The direction and script are marvelous, too, and indeed the whole production breathes class and refinement. If you are a fan of historical fare, don't miss this one. You will be enchanted. But, even if you are not a normal admirer of the 'bodice drama', you will be so enthralled with the Duchess that you will bow to its ultimate power and beauty.",9,4,9,16 October 2008
Gone with the Wind," No one needs another review of this film but, as a film lover, I've never really cared for it
","Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) is a 16 year old headstrong Southern belle just before the civil war. At every picnic and gathering of folks near her father's plantation in Georgia, our Miss O'Hara is knee deep in admiring men, for she is beautiful and saucy. Unhappily for her, however, the one gentleman she really has eyes for, Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), doesn't seem to be interested in becoming a suitor, although he considers her a friend. This is because, after tradition, Ashley has been 'promised' for a long time to his distant cousin, Melanie (Olivia DeHavilland). Being a bold lady, Scarlett tries to court HIM, when she is supposed to be napping before a ball. He turns her down, reluctantly and leaves the room. Scarlett throws a fit and a piece of china and narrowly misses another man, Rhett Butler (Clark Gable). From that moment, Mr. Butler has admiration for Scarlett, for he has defied a few conventions himself. Stung from Ashley's rejection, Scarlett marries Melanie's brother in haste, for the war has just started and he must leave to fight. Through the war, Scarlett and Melanie live together in Atlanta and when Sherman comes marching, Rhett rescues the ladies and actually declares his love for Scarlett, before leaving her on the road home, as he is enlisting, finally. She is as mad as a hatter, both from his hot kisses and his abandonment. Yet, Miss O'Hara makes it home, keeps hold of the plantation through the reconstruction period and still harbors love for Mr. Wilkes. Yet, when Scarlett's second husband dies, she agrees to, at last, marry Rhett, for he is very rich. But, will it be love everlasting? Wait and see. First, let me state that I LOVE the book and got it as an eighth grade birthday present. It is one of the great love stories of all time, set in the South at a difficult point in history. But, I've never been overly fond of the movie. There are several reasons. The cast, while some call it a 'dream', is merely good. Hattie McDaniel, who plays the faithful mammy of Scarlett, is my favorite while Leigh, Howard and DeHavilland are certainly fine. Gable is good, too, but he's not my idea of the perfect Rhett, though many others think so. I always wanted Burt Reynolds, in his 'Dan August' heyday to star in a new version, for he was smoking hot. Obviously, this won't happen. But, while sets, costumes, and photography are nicely done, the script is overly melodramatic and maudlin, taking power away from the story, and the direction must be blamed, too. All in all, there are so many remakes of classics today, why doesn't someone give this one a modern take? But, it probably won't occur, for most film fans, unlike myself, consider this the classic of all classics and feel any new version would fall on its face.",7,2,4,5 February 2013
Mamma Mia!," Mamma Mea Culpa! WHY did I WAIT so long to see this melodious, super-soaking blast of fun?
","Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is getting married very soon on the Greek Island where she and her mother, Donna (Meryl Streep) run an aging hotel. She is crazy about her intended and the feeling is mutual. However, Sophie's major problem is that she has never known her father and there is no one to give her away at her wedding. Finding her mother's long lost journal, Sophie is astounded to learn that her mother was involved with three men at the moment of Sophie's, er, conception. One was Sam (Pierce Brosnan), who left Donna in tears to go back to his fiancé in New York City. After that, for comfort, Donna became entangled with Harry (Colin Firth) and Bill (Stellan Skarsgaard) in the following weeks. But, who then, is the real father? Desperate to learn her genetic heritage, Sophie sends secret wedding invitations to all three former suitors, without her mother's knowledge. As Donna's best friends Rosie (Julie Walters) and Tanya (Christine Baranski) arrive on the island for the nuptials, so do the three former flames. How will Donna handle the reunion and is Sophie, despite being in love, ready to get married in the face of such complications? This film is so much fun and its songs by Abba are so infectious that I am kicking myself repeatedly for waiting so long to see it. Naturally, the cast plays a big role in the movie's success, for the performers are all charming and they can sing, too. Streep is very humorous as the mother of the bride and she belts out her numbers with ease and talent. Seyfried, too, is most beautiful and touching as the young lady on the verge of marriage and her voice is stunning. As for Brosnan, Firth, Baranski, Skarsgaard, and Walters, they are a hoot and a holler, making the most of every line and every song. Then, too, the setting in Greece is knock-out gorgeous, the costumes are fetching, the script is great fun and the direction snappy and sound. Also, Abba's legendary songs are so catchy and great that who will be able to stop singing them in the shower, in the car or wherever, after a showing? No one. In short, this melodious, super-soaking blast of entertainment should be on everyone's gift list. Any misfortunes, from stubbed toes to root canal to parking tickets, will be totally forgotten as this flick's sunny nature can permeate the most discontented person's soul and bring instant relief.",9,0,1,13 November 2008
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Hobbitually, I don't watch Tolkien but got stuck at a relative's house; found this entertaining and visually beautiful
","Bilbo (Martin Freeman) has been traveling with a band of dwarfs, encouraged by Gandolf (Ian McKellen) to see a bit of the world. The little folks, led by Thorin (Richard Armitage), are going to a well- known mountain where a dragon sits on a huge pile of gold. This wealth was stolen, long ago, from the dwarfs. On the journey, there are many dangers. Once in Laketown, a village burned once by the dragon, they try to get advice from a wise gentleman (Luke Evans) but he doesn't want to join the party. Also protecting the group are two very skilled warrior-elves (Orlando Bloom and Evangeline Lilly). At last, the wee folks arrive at the mountain, where a secret door only shown when the last rays of sun light it up, reveals itself. Bilbo has the key. Once inside, the dragon is a formidable foe and there more dangerous incidents. So, what if they do defeat the dragon and regain their lost treasure? Will this bring peace, especially when the dwarfs have promised to share the bounty with others? Hobbitually, I don't watch fantasy films like this. But, over a holiday weekend, my relatives chose this one in my company. Surprisingly, the movie was quite entertaining and beautifully filmed. There are so many characters that it is, initially, very hard to come on board but, soon, one learns who to cheer and who to scorn. Freeman is perfect for Bilbo, portraying a quiet, peace- loving Hobbit with subtle charm. Of the others, each one has strengths but I especially loved Lilly and Evans. Also scary is the voice of the dragon, fashioned by Benedict Cumberbatch to perfection. Indeed, the dragon is a wonder to behold, being very real in its inception. The scenery from New Zealand is glorious while the costumes are fun, too. Okay, maybe you will never get 'stuck' watching this with family. But, in truth, if you take a chance, you might find it has more to offer than expected.",7,0,0,27 November 2017
To Rome With Love," To Woody, with great love from the movie-loving world, bellissimo!
","In Rome, there are lots of folks on the verge of great love. There is the young American tourist (Alison Pill) who just happens to get directions to the Trevi fountain from a gorgeous young Italian lawyer. Soon, they are seeing the city and having dinner. But, the idyllic phase may be over when her parents (Judy Davis and Woody Allen) fly in from the States to meet the young man and his family. The lawyer's father, a mortician, sings opera in the shower well but fails to make an impact when he has no soap in his hands. Then, there is a young architectural student (Jesse Eisenberg) who has a live-in girlfriend (Greta Gerwig) he supposedly is much in love with. What a curveball when her longtime, struggling-actress pal (Ellen Page) shows up to turn his attentions in a new direction. An older building designer (Alec Baldwin) is around to give him advice. There is also the gentle clerk (Roberto Benigni) who suddenly captures the world's attention, even to what kind of underwear he sports! And, what about the young married couple, straight from the country, who come to Rome for a new, wealthier life and get tangled up with a call girl (Penelope Cruz) and a philandering actor? What doings and what romance is in the air! Dear Woody, don't be scared, but I am a number one fan, among many in the world. Therefore, every work you create is like adding a new element to the periodic table. This one is fresh, funny, clever, and utterly gorgeous in its photography. The cast, very large, is also terrific! Bravo! For all you film fans everywhere, in Rome, New York, or Peoria, go see it. Immediately, if not sooner.",9,12,23,10 July 2012
Man on the Moon," Hardly an easy watch but fascinating......Carrey is terrific as the complex Kaufman
","Andy Kaufman (Jim Carrey) has been an odd duck since childhood. Instead of playing outside, he often put on 'shows' indoors, using puppets and his vibrant imagination. Although his father objected to his spending long hours alone, both parents love their son greatly. Now an adult, Andy does stand up comedy in the Long Island area but his routines are often greeted with stony silence, as the audience does not understand his sense of humor. However, a Hollywood agent (Danny Devito) catches Andy's act one night and senses something unique. He signs Andy on as a client and soon Andy appears on SNL, where he lip-synches the 'Mighty Mouse' song and gets big laughs. This leads to a stint on a hit sitcom called Taxi, something Andy does not want to do, feeling that 'canned laughter' television is the lowest of the low. However, as part of his contract, Andy will get his own television special, among other unusual demands. But, away from the show, Andy participates in bizarre wrestling matches and travels to college campuses where he often insults audiences. Just who does this Andy Kaufman think he is? This is a fascinating film about Kaufman, who was certainly one of the strangest 'stars' Hollywood ever encountered. It is very difficult to say, even now, whether he was mentally ill or just highly unusual. In any case, Carrey is magnificent as Kaufman, leaving the audience to wonder if anyone else could have played this role. The supporting cast, too, of DeVito, Courtney Love, and Paul Giamatti is just terrific. The movie's recreation of the 70's and 80's, through costumes, sets, and art direction, is great as well. But, the story, which alternates between high humor, sadness, and outright disgust is as complex as they come, making the flick a difficult watch. However, if you love Carrey or harbored great affection for Kaufman himself, you MUST see this film. It's 'look-behind-the-scenes' portrait of an unusual man is fascinating stuff.",7,0,0,27 December 2007
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Grand in many ways, especially in sets and art direction, also very imaginative; misses ten stars by a small, small margin
","In the country of Zubrowka, on the continent of Europe, a former lobby boy at the Grand Budapest Hotel, Zero (F. Murray Abraham as an older man, Tony Revolori as a young man) is telling his story to a famous writer (Jude Law and Tom Wilkinson at various ages). This inn, now fallen on hard times, was once a lavishly beautiful place of accommodation for the wealthy and famous. In truth, Zero's former boss at the establishment, Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) was one of the primary reasons for the GB's phenomenal success. This meticulous man courted the rich ladies and gents and met their every needs. But, perhaps, he did his job too well. One unhappy day, the supremely rich Madame D (Tilda Swinton) dies and leaves a valuable painting to M. Gustave. This sets off a ferocious row for the lady's family, especially for her eldest, nasty Dimitri (Adrien Brody). As M. Gustave and Zero 'lifted' the painting after the funeral, Dimitri send his henchman, Joplin (Willen Dafoe) after anybody who stands in the way of the painting's recovery, including their loyal lawyer (Jeff Goldblum). M. Gustave is even thrown in prison for awhile but makes just the right sort of pals inside, ones who can spring him out with their smarts and bravado (including Harvey Keitel). But, even after this happenstance, M Gustave and Zero are chased, up mountains, through fields and down dark alleys. Helping them is Zero's girlfriend, Agatha (Saorsie Ronan), and a large group of fellow hotel workers. Could there even be a new will that might cut Dimitri out completely? Who will triumph in the end? This grand and amazing film is a treasure for those who long for films of imagination, cleverness, and courage. To be honest, GBH falls a bit short of ten stars but certainly merits nine. To begin, its scale is incredible, with a dream cast and a mountainous setting that is breathtaking. Among the cast, its hard to pick favorites, but Fiennes, Goldblum, Keitel, Brody and Dafoe were most impressive to me, as well as the youngster, Revolori. One could add that they had the most 'showy' roles, while the rest did very well indeed in their quieter parts. Also, the art direction, costumes, script, story, and frenetic direction also score huge points for dazzle, even though they sometimes fall a wee whisker short. All in all, how can anyone who loves film really resist the chance to see this one? They don't make em like this much anymore!",9,0,7,8 April 2014
Revolutionary Road," Devastating look at one very desperate housewife and her family, hard to take but easy to admire
","April Wheeler is one very desperate housewife in the 1950's. She married her attractive husband, Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio), thinking his unconventional ways and casual attitude toward his jobs would result in a less-than-ordinary life. However, once April got pregnant with her daughter, and her younger son, Frank changed. He started to work for the same staid Manhattan firm where his father had toiled for years and he moved his family into a lovely home in suburban Connecticut. Consequently, April is in a state of slow suffocation, for although she appears to be the typical, all-American housewife, she is not. One day, April greets Frank with a big smile and a nifty family party for his 30th birthday. That's because April has hatched a plan. Why can't the Wheelers move to Paris, which Frank saw and admired during his military years, and which would surely hold a bevy of new sights and sounds? Frank would not even have to work, April would work as a secretary for a government agency and Frank can figure out what he really wants to do in life. Caught up in April's enthusiasm, Frank agrees to the new venture. But, then April finds out she is pregnant with the couple's third child. What will happen to April's dreams of a new life? This is a devastating look at one very desperate housewife and her unhappiness with a picture-postcard family existence. April's problems are compounded by the fact that she lives in the 1950's when women were just beginning to break out of the typical homemaker 'mold'. In the 21st century, many couples grow apart as they grow older and there is not as much of a stigma to ending a marriage and starting all over again. Yet, Frank is a sympathetic character, too, for he is not the money-driven businessman that many folks are, but he does have a family to support and his feet are more rooted in reality than April's. The result is that the Wheelers are a couple in desperate need of serious counseling but they don't get it and tragedy ensues. As the principal actors, Winslet and DiCaprio are incomparable in their difficult roles. Winslet embodies the beautiful, unhappy April as few actresses could but DiCaprio, despite receiving no similar award nominations, is every bit her equal in his part as the torn-in-two directions husband. All of the supporting cast, from Kathy Bates to Michael Shannon and the rest, are absolutely marvelous, too. The scenery in suburban Connecticut is lovely, the costumes well chosen, and the production values are first rate. As for the story and its direction, by Sam Mendes, they are monumentally powerful and sad. Not all of us are cut out for the 'normal' family life and to feel caught in a life style you don't love is a major downer. Therefore, this is not the film to see if you are in a state of depression or are experiencing any difficulties in your own family relationships, for it will thoroughly demoralize you. But, if you are a movie fan who yearns for a film to 'shake you to your bones', with a strong story and great depth, this one just can't be missed. Mendes, as in American Beauty, is a master at showing the dark side of anyone's seemingly sunny life.",10,0,1,29 January 2009
Gone Girl," Oh, yeah, she's gone; brilliant, engrossing movie
","Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) lives in the small, riverside Missouri town that he grew up in. It hasn't always been so. For a number of years, Nicky worked in Manhattan as a journalist, where he met his brilliant wife, Amy (Rosamunde Pike). Also a writer, Amy grew up in the area, with two somewhat famous author-parents, who concocted a young lady's series of books called Amazing Amy. But, the economy took a nosedive and both young marrieds lost their jobs. At the same time, Nick's mother got breast cancer so the couple decided to move back to the Show Me State. Nick opens a bar with some of Amy's trust fund while Amy ponders her next move. One morning, alas, Nick is called home by a neighbor, who has seen his cat outside. When he arrives home, Nick sees signs of a possible break-in at their abode and Amy is missing. That's right, she's gone, girl. Meanwhile, there are scenes of Amy writing a diary, telling the details of how they met and how blissful early married life seemed. She also notes that the Missouri move has troubled her. But, now, she's missing. The police have few clues but believe a media event to ask for the city's help in finding her would be the best way to go. Reluctantly, Nick calls his in-laws and they rush to town, where they make a televised appeal for Amy's safe return. All too soon, Nick is attacked as 'not sorry enough' and is fingered as the likely individual responsible for his wife's disappearance. The only person in Nick's corner at the moment is his twin, Margo, who co-owns the bar. With an increasing media frenzy, Nick is in the hot seat. But, there's more. There are secrets by the dozens to be uncovered, some for Nick and some big ones for Amy. What appears to be a kidnapping may be something else. Will she be coming home? Will Nick be sent to the slammer? This brilliant, engrossing thriller cannot be talked about in detail; otherwise, the twists are revealed. Let's just say 'what lies beneath' may not be pretty. The cast is stunning, with Affleck and Pike doing grand work while Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry, Kim Dickens, and all of the others are fantastic, too. The watery setting is likewise intriguing. But, its the story, script, and direction that towers above everything else. Gillian Flynn, who wrote the novel, has fashioned a script that mirrors the book and is quite wonderful. As for the direction, David Fincher (with great editing, too) keeps the relentless pace and mystery in every moment. Equally good is his camera shots, opting to fade in and out with visual power. So, add it up and the sum is one fantastic flick indeed. As Mikey said long ago, oh yeah, she's gone and viewers wouldn't want it any other way.",10,1,13,7 October 2014
The Theory of Everything," Here is a PROVED theory, this film is very fine
","Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) is a brilliant doctoral physics student at Cambridge. When a professor gives the class ten 'impossible' questions to answer, Stephen apologizes for only getting nine of them. No one else is even close. A bit shy, he spies a beautiful fellow student, Jane (Felicity Jones) at a campus party one night and they have a great conversation. Before long, Stephen is asking her to a special dance, even though he can't cut a rug himself! There is one huge difference in their lives, however. Jane is a devout Christian while Stephen is a professed atheist, only trusting in science. Suddenly, the courtship is on hold. This is due to a terrible fall Stephen has on a sidewalk and the subsequent, very sobering diagnosis of motor neuron disease, similar to ALS. Naturally, Stephen is disheartened and holes up in his room. Only Felicity, arriving to see what has occurred, restores hope to him, with her declaration of love. They are married, they soon have a son. But, the progression of the disease is awful while the doctors give him two years to live. Meanwhile, theories of the creation of the universe and other 'small' topics keep his mind focused away from his doomed future. But, is it so? The couple has two more children and, despite being reduced to a wheelchair, Stephen lives on. What exactly does the future of S and J hold? This very fine film chronicles the life of the brilliant British scientist, Hawking, and his physical and emotional struggles. Also told is the lesser known tale of his first wife, Jane. As the physicist, Redmayne is superb, making Hawking's descent into anatomical deterioration very, very real. Jones is likewise wonderful and the rest of the cast, including Emily Watson, a great collection of performances as well. All movie amenities, from sets to costumes, script, and direction are of the highest caliber as well. No, its not a happily ever after story, in many ways, but it is an extremely well done tale of the courage and determination of the human spirit. My theory is, you will be well advised to purchase tickets for this one soon.",8,3,5,4 December 2014
Bolt," Bolt out the door to see or purchase this one, it is very fun & cute
","Bolt the dog (voiced by John Travolta) is the star of an espionage television series. His owner, teenager Penny (voiced by Miley Cyrus) is his co-star. On the show, Bolt possesses 'super' powers and is able to stop trucks with his paws, start explosions with his 'stare' and outrun the bad guys. However, he lives on the set, in his own trailer, and never leaves the premises, not even to go home for the weekend with Penny. Consequently, he is unaware that he is an ordinary dog but, instead, he truly believes he is a superdog. Therefore, on the day that two pestering cats entice him to leave his trailer, he finds himself out in the 'real' world. After a mishap, he ends up in a delivery truck to New York City, far away from Hollywood. Still thinking his special skills will get him home pronto, he is in for a rude awakening. But, through the help of a stray cat named Mittens (Susie Essmann) and a hamster named Rhino (Mark Walters), he begins the long cross-country journey. Will he make it? This film was cute and fun, with very nice animation and a clever script. There is a touch of violence, especially at the beginning, for the world of the superhero is rarely without danger, even on a television show. So, perhaps the film is unsuitable for the very youngest viewers. However, the cast is wonderful, with Travolta doing an excellent job as the voice of Bolt. Cyrus, too, is touching in her role as Penny, while Essmann and Walters are really superb additions to the film. All of the lesser characters are voiced very nicely, too, especially Malcolm McDowell as the pipes of the main heavy. The animation is colorful, skillful and very realistic, resulting in an attractive movie. Then, too, the score is quite fine, with Travolta and Cyrus doing a duet near the film's end. All in all, if you care about quality films for families, bolt out the door and arrange a viewing of Bolt. Everyone will be yapping with delight as the film runs its course.",8,7,11,10 December 2008
Ghost Rider," A fun ride, aimed at tweenage boys, I suppose, but still enjoyable for most everyone
","Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) has been a motorcycle stunt rider since childhood, having been trained by his stuntman father. However, when Johnny's father gets cancer, the devil himself (Peter Fonda) comes to make a deal with 18 year old Johnny. He'll cure dad of his cancer if Johnny will sign his soul over to him. Almost before he realizes what he has done, Johnny agrees. However, although Johnny's father is cured, he dies shortly after in a motorcycle accident. Johnny is heartbroken and leaves town, running away from his lovely girlfriend, Roxanne (Eva Mendes). But, the devil tells Johnny he will come for him when he is needed. Flash forward several years. Johnny Blaze is the greatest motorcycle stunt rider in the world, thrilling audiences everywhere, by jumping over helicopters, among other things. Roxanne, now a reporter, arrives to interview him and Johnny realizes he still loves her. Bad timing. The devil comes back to demand Johnny's services as a 'ghost rider', a person who tracks down the bad guys and gives them a push toward their final destination, hell. Mestophiles also wants Johnny to battle his evil son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) and his gang. If Johnny can defeat Blackheart, the devil will give him back his soul. Whew, what a deal! Can Johnny summon the courage to take back his life? This is an exciting movie, based on a Marvel comic book hero. Cage, a very fine actor as evidenced by Adaptation and Matchstick Men, gives a nice turn as the troubled hero and he looks, well, very hot. Mendes, too, charms the audience with her stunning beauty and sweet demeanor. As the devil, Fonda strikes the right note while Bentley, who always looks creepy, poor guy, was made to order for his role as the devil's son. The look of the film is adequate, with mostly well-chosen costumes, interesting sets, and some nice visuals. However, one does get the feeling that some corners were cut in the special effects department, making the film look cheap when compared to a movie such as the original Batman. There are a few disturbing images, too, rendering the film unsuitable for those under 10. Yet, all in all, this is an exciting ride, especially for folks who love comic books and their superheroes. As an evening's entertainment, Ghost Rider delivers a big dose of thrills and chills.",7,1,2,24 May 2007
P.S. I Love You," P.leasantly S.weet, I liked it, but it is just good, not great
","Holly (Hillary Swank) has been married for a number of years to handsome Gerry (Gerard Butler), an Irish gentleman. Wed at 19, he is the only love of her life and they have big plans for the future. Sadly, however, Gerry is stricken with cancer and dies, leaving Holly desolate. But, much to her surprise, letters start arriving from Gerry, under unusual circumstances, letters that provide encouragement for Holly to move forward with her life. Gerry suggests that Holly do some karaoke and take a trip to Ireland, where she should learn to fish and visit his relatives. It doesn't' hurt that Holly has two loving friends (Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon), a hovering mother (Kathy Bates), and a good-looking new friend (Harry Connick, Jr.) looking out for her, also. But, can Holly truly overcome the serious blow that life has given her? This is a sweet movie but, I must confess, I was a wee bit disappointed. Yes, I loved the basic story and the cast is beyond terrific. Swank is quite nice as the young widow while Butler is greatly engaging as the husband, with many of his scenes told in flashback. In fact, Butler is a new favorite among American women, thanks to Dear Frankie, and let us all hope we see much more of him. Kudrow, Gershon, Bates, Connick Jr., and some of the Irish players are just right, too, breathing more life into a script that is erratic and sometimes contrived. Of course, the sets in Manhattan and Ireland are very wonderful, as are the costumes and great camera work. But, the film could have used more careful direction and editing, in my view. However, all fans of romantic comedy should not miss it, no. As the fountain of romcom films has considerably dried up in the last two years, any new entry is a hearty meal for the starving. Just do not expect another Music and Lyrics this time around.",6,50,80,26 December 2007
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Cute new take on the James Thurber classic, see it!
","Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) has a secret life in his daydreams. When he wants to kiss the girl or take a swing at his boss, he can do it in a pretend world that is very realistic. Most times, someone has to say something to bring him back to earth. As an employee of the photography department of Life Magazine, he is very respected. But, his world is turned over when a beautiful divorcée, Cheryl (Kristen Wiig) joins the staff. How to approach her is his burning question. At first, he joins a matchmaking site and tries to 'wink' at her profile. She doesn't wink back. But, when a new owner arrives at the magazine and starts throwing his weight around, Walter and Cheryl have a bond. The two become worried that they will be let go. This is especially true when a valuable negative turns up missing and Walt will take the blame if its not found. Believing it is with a world traveling photographer, Walter breaks away from his comfort zone and jets to Greenland and Iceland to catch up with the shutterbug. Will he make it home? Will our dear Walter also win the day with Cheryl? If you have never read the Thurber story on which this film is based, do it now. Even so, this new take on the tale is cute, funny, and worthwhile without that foundation. Especially fine is the cast and the breathtaking scenery in far away climes. Yet, the script, costumes, and direction are wonderful as well. Secretly slip out the door and surprise your family with this fine little flick.",8,5,8,27 January 2015
I Am Legend," All of you who crave new films in the apocalyptic category, you must see this one!
","A major scientist (Emma Thompson) goes on television to announce that a cure for cancer has been discovered. Although it involves fighting the virus with a designer virus, it is working magnificently. Flash forward three years. Dr. Robert (Will Smith) and his most loyal dog, Samantha are out on the streets of New York City. It soon becomes clear that they are the only ones walking the by-ways, as their sole encounters are with a herd of deer and, surprisingly, a lion and her cubs. Wait, in New York City, home to 8 million people? That is correct. It seems that the designer virus mutated and caused the death of nearly every human being on the planet. Only Dr. Robert is alive and immune in the Big Apple. When he makes his way back home, however, he does two surprising things. One, he heads for his lab, where there are some extremely agitated rats in cages. Looking them over, Robert makes note of the fact that one of the rats appears calmer and more like a typical rodent. This please the doctor, as he has been struggling to find a vaccine that would bring all of the rats back to normalcy from their present, rabid-like state. The second noteworthy action of the doctor is that, at sunset, he pulls steel curtains in front of all of the glass windows, and sleeps with a loaded gun in his hands, with Sam resting nearby. Strange. Even stranger noises, like bat voices, emanate from the outside. Yet, the next day, Dr. Robert is back on the streets, communicating via radio that he is alive and hoping to contact any other survivors out in the world. Unfortunately, an accident renders him out on the streets as the sun starts to disappear over the horizon. The strange, horrific voices return. Are Dr. Robert and Sam really alone in the city? Maybe not! This is another entry into the glorious repertoire of apocalyptic cinema. In the tradition of The Road Warrior, Strange Days, The Terminator and company, Legend is a fine, but not exceptional, film. It has an interesting story, although one that is not without its flaws. For example, how is it that a noted doctor and scientist happens to be the one survivor in Manhattan, instead of, let's say, a member of the garbage crew? Even so, the tale has some merit, as the man-playing-God strategy in the world of science is bound to cause problems from time to time. Also, as evidenced by the bird flu, viruses are the bane of human existence, as fighting them is a huge problem. As the main character, Smith is great, for he exhibits courage and intelligence in a big way. Other actors appear in the film, in flashback, mostly, and most worthily, too, although they are primarily a group of unknown thespians. The sets are amazing, for here is a New York City, with all of its buildings, but without a human being in sight. The settings, along with the remarkable cinematography, contribute heavily to the film's success. As for the direction, it is a bit uneven, as there are moments when the film lags into brief interludes of boredom for the viewer. However, when the action heats up, it is powerful. All in all, after a showing, most viewers will leave the theater a bit spent, emotionally. Do you adore futuristic films where civilization has degenerated into chaos and despair, only to have a hero or heroine emerge to 'save the world'? Then, don't miss I Am Legend, as you will be enthralled with its take on the fall of humankind.",8,0,1,13 March 2008
Gran Torino," Gran Torino is a fine vehicle, wonderfully touching and real, but, tears may fall for many viewers
","Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a retired automobile lineman, living in or around Detroit. He has just lost his wife and his relationship with his two sons and their families is somewhat strained as well. Therefore, he is mostly a solitary creature, taking superb care of his house and lawn and spending most of his days alone with his dog, Daisy. The neighborhood around his home is in decay, because those with the means to maintain their homes are moving out and the poorer folks are moving in. In fact, the house next to Walt's holds three generations of Hmong immigrants, much to Walt's disgust. That's because he is, first, somewhat of a bigot and, second, because he has haunting memories of the time he spent in the Korean War, killing the 'enemy'. One day, two of the Hmong neighbors, daughter Sue (Ahney Her) and son Thao (Bee Vang) are harassed by a gang of other Hmong low-lifes. It is Walt who comes to their rescue, telling the riffraffs to get off the block. Suddenly, he is a hero to the Hmong and, reluctantly, Walt strikes up a friendship with Sue and Thao, much to his surprise. But, even though Walt helps the sensitive Thao learn how repair things and start a job in the construction industry, the gang members refuse to leave him and his lovely sister, Sue, alone. What will it take to bring an end to their threats and actions? At 78, Eastwood has nothing more to prove, yet he has produced another stunning winner. Although it is not quite as worthy as Mystic River (that is one of the greatest films of all time) or Million Dollar Baby, Clint has still created a beautifully complex movie that will fascinate and touch viewers everywhere. With his portrayal of a repugnant bigot, first glance, Eastwood is at his best, showing Walt, also, as a gritty and determined war veteran and hard-working American. His Kowalski, too, is quite comical in his incessant racially-charged put-downs and his guttural groans which harken back to Lurch on the Addams Family! Without a doubt, this is the terrific performance of a cinematic master. Also quite wonderful are Vang and Her as the targeted siblings, each giving heart-breaking yet comical turns as the sensitive people who can't escape the bullying of others. All other cast members, including Christopher Carley as a caring priest, are just marvelous, too. The setting in Detroit (or Hamtramck?) is also a wonder, making one sad for the loss of a great city in these times but making one admire the strength of those who have stayed. Costumes, cinematography, and other production values are great, also. As for the story and its direction, they will grab the viewer by the gut and never let go. In short, Gran Torino is a terrific film vehicle which never runs out of fuel. Every viewer will feel immensely rewarded as the closing credits roll.",8,2,5,14 January 2009
Ex Machina," Roy, Pris, Leon, Zorah, and Rachel of Blade Runner, you would cheer for Ava, she makes you proud
","In the near future, Caleb (Domhnall Glesson) is a tech wizard for a large Google type company. One day, he wins an astounding lottery; he is chosen to meet the CEO of Bluebook, his employer. Yet, this meeting is not on site, it will take place in the chairman Nathan's (Oscar Isaac) mountain abode. Only way to travel there is by chopper. When Caleb arrives, Nathan is not there to greet him but he is issued an entrance by his work card. Roaming the vast mansion, Caleb meets Nathan at last in the workout room. Formalities are exchanged. But, all too soon, it becomes clear that this is working vacation. Nathan brags that he has developed a highly sophisticated cyborg, Ava (Alicia Vikander) and it will be Caleb's 'job' to administer a Turing test. This will rate her intelligence. What a turn of events this is. Naturally, Ava is quite beautiful, although some of her robot parts are showing. All too soon, Caleb is fascinated with his subject. While Nathan will be observing their encounters from a remote location, there are power outages from time to time. It is then that Ava tells Caleb that SHE is causing the power blips and that she needs his help to escape the underground bunker where she lodges. Holy Blade Runner. This becomes more complicated when Nathan tells Caleb that Ava will try to manipulate him. There is considerable attention all around, with a lovely Japanese servant throwing another spanner in the works. What will Caleb do? Will he trust Ava? Will he be able to outsmart the security and plans of Nathan, his employer, if Ava is indeed being abused? This is an amazing, amazing film. Its on the same level as films like A.I. and Jurassic Park. Just because something is capable of being done, it doesn't mean its a good idea to do it. Here, the world is about to experience the 'A-bomb' of cyborgs in the mesmerizing Ava. The cast, quite small, is wonderful, as each character is difficult to like for various reasons. Vikander is both beautiful and mysterious while Gleeson and Isaac play a head-to-head twosome that is marvelous to view. The film moves slowly, but its not a problem, as it is broken into interviews Caleb conducts with Ava. In any case, it never fails to fascinate, no matter the pace. The setting is great, too, and while there are a few nice special effects, they are not the focus of the movie and, in truth, razzle dazzle is not needed. If you always felt a bit sorry for the replicants in Blade Runner, wow, is this flick for you. Ava turns the tables on the members of homo sapiens but good. Find Ex Machina, find it now.",9,6,11,22 September 2015
The Illusionist," It's no illusion, this film delivers on every promise
","Eisenheim (Edward Norton) and Sophie (Jessica Biel) are childhood friends. This is odd, because Sophie is a duchess and Eisenheim merely the son of a cabinet maker. They meet in secret until, one day, her relatives discover their friendship and forbid them to see each other again. Heartbroken, Eisenheim goes abroad for 15 years. He returns as a talented magician and causes quite a stir with the shows he puts on in his native Vienna. One evening, a crown prince attends a show with his fiancé, beautiful Duchess Sophie. The prince volunteers his lady for a magic trick and it is a stunner. But, more important, the two old friends are reaquainted. They rediscover their love for each other but know that it can not be permanent. The crown prince is an evil man who would hunt them down wherever they would go, it is said. Is there no way that true love can triumph? This is a lovely, lovely film that takes the viewer to a different time and place with splendor. The principal actors are wonderful, Norton and Biel giving touching performances as the lovers, and Rufus Sewell giving another fine but dark turn as the evil prince. (Hopefully, someone, someday will give Sewell another comedy such as Uncorked was, to appear in.) Paul Giamatti also embodies his role as a Viennese police officer very well. The settings and costumes are magnificent and the script is sweet, well-written, and efficient. Those who love history, magic, and romance will take to this film like a moth to a candle. But, truly everyone who sits down to watch the movie will get caught up in its unusual and beautiful story. It's no illusion, this film truly delivers on every promise.",8,2,4,23 September 2006
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Curious....lovely, touching, well-acted, but, indeed, curious
","On the night World War I ends, a male child is born in New Orleans. His birth also coincides with a clockmaker's creation of a timepiece that runs 'backwards'. Rushing through a festive crowd in the Big Easy, the father of the child does not make it home for the birth. Instead, he finds his wife dying. The father, a Mr. Button, promises his spouse that he will find a place in the world for his son. But, when Button lays eyes on his child, he is horrified. The little boy is a baby with characteristics of a eighty year old man, wrinkled skin, cataracts, etc. In complete disgust, Mr. Button snatches the child and runs into the night, leaving the baby on the doorstep of a home for the aged. There, a kind nurse, Queenie (Tariji P. Henson) takes pity on the infant and claims him as her own, naming him Benjamin (Brad Pitt). The doctor for the home declares that the baby will not live long. Nevertheless, the infant does live and, as he grows, he appears younger at each birthday. At age seven, he finally can leave his wheelchair and walk, although he still wears thick glasses and looks quite ancient. But, to those closest to him, it is apparent that as he gets 'older', his body grows 'younger'. Curious. Around this time, also, Benjamin meets the granddaughter, Daisy (Cate Blanchett, as she grows up), of one of the home's residents and he forms a strong friendship with the little girl. They will meet again and again over the years. Although Benjamin eventually goes out into the world, finding work on a tugboat, traveling to far away places, falling in love with an older woman (Tilda Swinton), his appearance grows ever younger until he finally becomes quite, quite handsome. A chance encounter with Daisy leads him back into a relationship with her. But, with Benjamin and Daisy traveling into old age in different directions, what kind of future will they have? This is a most lovely film, but it remains, throughout, a curiosity in movie making. Based on a story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, its story is so different and, told so leisurely, that it may not suit everyone. In truth, the tale must unfold at a slower pace, for it is meant to simulate the complete life of a man whose years run in the opposite direction of everyone else in the world. As such, the special effects which allow Pitt to look like a 'wrinkled little boy' are amazing. But, first, the cast is terrific. Blanchett is wonderful as Daisy, a high-spirited dancer whose love for Benjamin is challenged by the circumstances. Indeed, she also appears, quite wonderfully, as an old woman, telling her tale to her daughter, Caroline (Julia Ormond), at diverse intervals throughout the film. Pitt, likewise, gives a heartbreakingly fine performance as a man whose life is extremely challenging, to say the least. Henson, Ormond, Swinton, and all of the other actors are absolutely terrific as well. As one might expect, the settings, costumes, cinematography, script and direction (by David Fincher) are sensational. But, for all of its weighty attributes, the film still remains an odd, curiosity piece in the realm of movie making. If you love Pitt or Blancett, you will not want to miss this one. Make that a ditto for those fans of fine film making who hold an admiration for bold, unique film ideas. But, for those who get restless during period pieces or slow, involved story lines, you may have to watch this one in several sittings and might be better off to rent the film sometime in the near future.",8,2,4,7 January 2009
Children of Men," A noble attempt is the kindest description one can give to this film
","It is the year 2037. Civilization has broken down everywhere, except in England. Naturally, human beings across the globe are entering the country, only to be apprehended and sent to concentration camps. Britian, it seems, is for Britain only. There is another problem, also, in that there have been no pregnancies in 18 years. No one knows exactly why women are infertile but pollution, global warming, food additives and the like are being blamed. Theo (Clive Owen) still has a high ranking government job but that does not mean he is living high off the hog, only that he is in a better state than most. He stays in touch with an old hippie friend (Michael Caine) who resides in a secret forested enclave near London. One day, Theo is kidnapped by a so-called terrorist group whose agenda is to ensure the fair treatment of immigrants and the end of the camps. Theo's ex-wife Julian (Julianne Moore) has ordered Theo's capture, in hopes that he will be able to garner the legal papers to escort a young lady to a safer community off the coast. It so happens she is miraculously pregnant and a hope for the future. Will Theo get involved? This film, although noble in its attempt, is not a very good movie. The culprit is the story, which, despite being by P.D. James, is disjointed, inconsistent, and incoherent, at times. This leads to incredulity and disappointment. Owen, a very fine actor, of course, tries his best and the rest of the cast is well chosen, too. The costumes are good but, the production values are a bit wanting, considering a futuristic setting. If you want to see a collapsed future world, try the Mad Max movies or Blade Runner. Although it tries hard, Children of Men ultimately goes belly up, unfortunately.",5,7,13,23 February 2007
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Ask not what Jedi will be last, there is always another hope; wonderful film!
","Rey (Daisy Ridley) has found Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in a faraway island planet and she asks for his help. As most viewers know, the universe is in jeopardy again, for after the Rebels got rid of the Empire, the new First Order arose thirty years later. As the supposed 'Last Jedi', Luke is needed to fight Supreme Ruler Snoke (Andy Serkis) and his nefarious sidekick, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). But, alas, Luke has not been in hiding for no reason. He blames himself for Kylo Ren's transformation from his nephew, Ben Solo, into the evil henchman. Nothing doing he tells Rey. Meanwhile, the remaining Rebels, commanded by Princess-General Leia (Carrie Fisher) are being pursued again by Snoke and have very few options. There remains a main ship of 'good guys and gals' with some lesser transports and Tie-fighters. Very brave, they leap into lightspeed, only to find the First Order has somehow tracked them. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and new gal Rose seek out Maz (Lupita N'Gongo) for a code breaker to help them find the Order's weaknesses. Meanwhile, Kylo Ren and Rey have disturbing long-distance talks, for they alone can see each other through time and space. Naturally, KR wants Rey to turn to his dark side and she wants the opposite. Snoke, meanwhile, is unhappy, at times, when Kylo Ren and General Hux (Domnhall Gleason) fail in their quest to wipe out the Rebellion. Can Rey and her companion Chewie persuade Luke to help them with his powers? Can Kylo Ren be turned back to the 'light' or does he have other tricks up his sleeve? This amazing film is beautiful, exciting and full of fine performances, including Fisher's last. The script and direction are top flight, although a sharper edit would have prevented some slower spots. Nevertheless, to miss this masterfully made movie would be a crime of the first order.",9,4,17,26 December 2017
The Imitation Game," Imitate all dedicated movie goers and see this one without delay
","Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), a mathematics professor in the early 1950'2, has experienced a burglary at his home. Yet, when the police come to investigate, they haul in Turing himself to the police station. What the charges might be will follow all too soon but, first, Turing tells a story of his life to one of the officers. During WW II, Turing was part of the code breaking team trying to crack the German's communication system, Enigma, which changed DAILY. Chosen for the job by a by-the-book Naval Commander (Charles Dance), Turing initially seemed to be anything but a team player. He's arrogant, odd, uncommunicative and insists on being in charge. This upsets those already on the job, including champion chess player Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode). This is not the first time that Alan has had problems getting along. Flashing backwards, the film shows his childhood at an English boarding school, where he was scorned and bullied by all his fellow students save one, Christopher. The two became inseparable and excelled at all subjects, especially math. A tragedy changes everything, resulting in Turing's further isolation. Back in WW II times, Turing does become the leader of the group, invents an early computer to help with the calculations of the Enigma code and earns the respect of the other topflight mathematicians, including Joan (Keira Knightley) on the team. He even becomes engaged to Joan when her parents want to withdraw her from the group, believing she will never find a husband. It can't last, however, because Alan is gay and must admit this. The breakers DO conquer Enigma and help win the war. But, at the time of his arrest, homosexuality is a against British law. Since his work was top secret, no one knows how much of a hero he was and is and, in any case, they convict him. What happens at the end is very, very sad yet his tale is truly inspirational. This movie is extraordinary in almost all aspects. Cumberbatch's performance equals that of Eddie Redmayne in Theory of Everything; wish the award ceremonies ahead could have dual top honors. Knightley, Goode, Dance, Mark Strong, and all of the rest are wonderful, too, dazzling the audience. Great congratulations should also be extended to the marvelous script, the masterful direction of three different time periods, and the tremendous costumes, settings, and effects. Do imitate all serious film fans and don't put off seeing this one. Its riches will be as stunning to you as to everyone the world over.",10,4,11,2 January 2015
Jerry Maguire," Still one of the most enjoyable Cruise films ever, shot Zellweger to stardom, too
","Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a hotshot sports agent. As such, he wants to get the fattest contracts for his clients because his own salary depends on it. He has a type A girlfriend, Avery (Kelly Preston) and a seemingly great life. But, one day, he has an epiphany. Jerry has seen the tears in the eyes of the children who wonder why Mr. Maguire is still talking money when their father or mother is gravely injured and probably shouldn't play again. Therefore, Jerry pens an open letter to his fellow agents at their huge firm, asking them to follow their hearts and not just the dollar signs. Although everyone initially claps Jer on the back, he is soon dumped. The executioner' (Jay Mohr), a more senior agent, does it in a crowded restaurant where he also announces his plans to 'takeover' everyone of Maguire's clients. All too soon it happens. Jerry retains only one athlete, Rod (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), an iffy client due to injuries. Cleaning out his desk, Jerry bravely tells the entire office he is opening his own agency and asks someone, anyone to go with him. Only one does. That would be Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger), a single mother of one darling son, Ray (Jonathan Lipnicki), who admired greatly the stance he took in his open letter. Yet, for both Jerry and Dorothy, the whole start-up biz is an extreme risk, with only one sure client. Meanwhile, Avery dumps her fiancÃ© on his ear when he loses the chance to represent a rookie NFL quarterback. Truth is, Jerry's old agency told a bunch of lies to steal this young man away. To complicate matters more, Jerry asks Dorothy out on a date, which goes well. Can romance and infant businesses make a good mix? Will Maguire, who stuck his head out for something good, now have it chopped off in the cruel world of capitalism? This is without a doubt Cruise's most enjoyable flick. Even folks who think they don't care for him will enjoy this one. It doesn't hurt, of course, to have sidekicks in Zellweger, Gooding, Jr., Bonnie Hunt, Mohr, Preston and the darling Lipnicki. Then, too, Cameron Crowe, who wrote and directed this gem, deserves lots of praise as well. To complete the movie's success are great costumes, sets, and photography. Come on, folks, re-runs of The Big Valley are nice but why not snag this film instead if you've never had the pleasure of it?",9,0,0,27 August 2013
Here Comes the Boom," Boom chases away Gloom! Hurray for Kevin James and company!
","In the Boston area, biology teacher Scott Voss (Kevin James) is a few minutes late to school. The principal (Greg Germain) gives him bus duty and docks him a vacation day, too. This hurts. Scott makes his way over to his friend and colleague Marty's (Henry Winkler) music class to plead with his pal to do the bus work. That's because there is a VERY important staff meeting that afternoon. Marty agrees. Later on, when classes are finished, the news at the get-together is anything but good. Finances are in bad shape and the school is dropping all extras, including music. Now, since Scott has just learned that Marty's wife is pregnant at 48 and the loss of Marty's job would be crucial, Scott announces that he will make the $50,000 needed to keep his friend's job. Okay, but how? Teaching night school won't do it, even though Scott enjoys helping the immigrants studying for their tests. But, amazingly, one of his pupils, Niko, informs Mr. Voss that even the lower levels of mixed-martial arts fighting give paychecks of hundreds and thousands of dollars. A lightbulb goes off, because Scott wrestled in college. THIS is how he will raise the dough, even if he loses every fight. Maybe, too, then beautiful school nurse, Bella (Salma Hayek) will accept his many, many invitations for a date. Most all think Mr. Voss is nuts, but he starts training. At his first fight, Scott wears Viking gear and plays a pounding song, Here Comes the Boom. Only Scott gets pounded into the ground but good. However, with $750 in his hand, Scott vows to continue. Soon, he is losing by a slim margin, then gains some victories. Will Mr. Voss make enough money for Marty? Also, will he become a better teacher in the process? That is, before broken noses and bones set in! We will see. This funny film makes good on a statement that Boom beats Gloom. James is becoming a national resource of tremendous value and he can make any role worthwhile. What a fine comic touch he has and what a pleasure to watch him. Hayek is extremely likable, too, as is Winkler. The rest of the cast is also just great, although some members are not well known. The Boston setting is good while the costumes, amenities, script and deft direction give viewers a really nice film, worthy of the ticket prices. So, ditch your doom and gloom but good. Run to buy a seat for a swell time at the movies.",8,6,10,24 October 2012
Mission: Impossible II," Exciting stuff, even when the plot meanders a bit; the cast is great
","Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) can't even take a mountain climbing vacation! As he reaches a summit, a helicopter appears and gives him his next mission. Well, he accepts it. It seems a man, Sean (Dougray Scott) wearing a Hunt false face, hijacked a formula for a deadly virus and its antidote. As it took place on a plane, the bad guys parachute away and the rest of the passengers and crew crash. Now Hunt has to get it back before it is sold to those who would use it to kill. For some reason, Hunt's bosses want him to team up with a beautiful thief, Nyah (Thandie Newton), presently in Spain. Holy garters, it takes a lot of begging, bartering and a perilous car chase for Ethan to bring her on board. Once a team, a romance begins, even though Ethan finds out later that she is Sean's ex- girlfriend. In fact, Nyah will have to pretend to return to her former love to make the mission work. This is dangerous territory indeed. Can Ethan and Nyah succeed? Having only seen one other MI movie, I have to say this was exciting stuff. John Woo, the director, knows how to get the pulse rate way up! Then, too, Cruise, Newton, Ving Rhames, Scott, and all of the others play cat and mouse very well. Beautiful scenery abounds, as does terrific costumes and snappy conversation. Cruise may not appeal to a few but this action film is first rate.",7,1,1,24 August 2017
The Adjustment Bureau," This world needs adjusting, no doubt about that; the film could have used some tweaking, too, but is still worthwhile
","David Morris (Matt Damon) is a rising politician for New York. From humble roots in Brooklyn, he is now a state representative and running for Congress. Unfortunately, near the end of a successful campaign, a raucus incident from his past resurfaces and, on election night, David loses. But, his disappointment is somewhat mitigated when he meets a beautiful lady, Elise (Emily Blunt) in the MEN'S ROOM at the campaign hotel. Elise, a ballet dancer, is hiding from security, as she crashed a wedding on the upper levels for a free meal. Supposed to be writing his concession speech, David has a definite connection with this graceful and captivating woman. However, he doesn't get her name or number. A few weeks later, David is catching a Manhattan bus for his new business job when, dumbstruck, he spies Elise on the vehicle, too. This time, he manages to ascertain her name and all of the important information. Fate, unfortunately steps in. Not only does the slip of paper with her number get lost, David finds himself locked in a parking garage with the 'men in hats'. There, they tell the young politician that are in 'charge of the world' and that he is not fated to be with Elise. If he pursues her, bad things might happen, to her and to him. Calling themselves The Adjustment Bureau, these men try to persuade David that only on their intervention is the world avoiding a few hundred mushroom clouds. Therefore, he, David, is going to be elected senator and, possibly more, in the future but Elise is not for him. Stunned, David is torn between his love for this lady and his own aspirations. Only one of the hatted men, Harry (Anthony Mackey) seems to understand his heartache. Will Harry buck the bureau and 're-adjust' the fate of the young couple? First, the premise of the film, a story by the incomparable Philip K. Dick, is truly fine but, perhaps, a bit dated. One can see the action as more relevant to the fifties and sixties, where nuclear war was on everyone's minds and politicians were still viewed as folks capable of uplifting a nation, rather than the more depressing circumstances of the new century. Also, the tale runs out of steam about a third from the finish, dampening the spirits of the audience. Its too bad. Not at fault are the two main actors, Damon and Blunt, for they are very great. One can only wish there were politicos like Damon and Blunt is rapidly becoming a favorite, for she is beautiful and brainy, both. The supporting cast, including Mackey and Terence Stamp, is nice as well. Lovely, too, are the beautiful sets, costumes, photography and effects. Yet, as the script is a letdown, so is the direction, for it doesn't build to a powerful ending or 'mix it up' enough to sustain a high level of relevancy. So. If you are fan of Dick's other film translations, such as Blade Runner, Paycheck, Minority Report, and Next, you should probably get a ticket for this one, also, or grab the DVD when it arrives. Despite its weaknesses, one finds oneself pondering its ideas after the cinema lights go back up. Or, if you like Damon or Blunt, you should make time for it, too. But, although it hurts to write a less than glowing account, this flick doesn't hit the 'wow' factor.",7,0,1,14 March 2011
Major League," A major classic in the realm of sports films, very funny and very inspiring
","Jake (Tom Berenger) has just been signed by the Cleveland Indians again. Having spent his most recent years in the Mexican league, he is happy to be in the SHOW once more. However, he learns quickly enough about the new owner's strategy. It seems this lady has deliberately assembled a team to LOSE, knocking attendance down so low that she can move the team to Miami Beach. How charming. Rookies Willie Mays Hays (Wesley Snipes) and Wild Thing (Charlie Sheen) are unhappy about their situations as well. But, what if they can rise to the occasion and become a winning team? After all, the team also sports a powerhitting, voodoo-believing clean up man, a born again pitcher, and a go-for-broke manager. And, if Jake can convince his ex-wife (Rene Russo) to take a chance again on him and the team, miracles can happen, can't they? This is an all star baseball movie, in every way, but is so humor-laden that any non-sports enthusiast will enjoy it very much, too. As the supposed rejects, Berenger, Snipes, Sheen, Corbin Bernsen, Bob Uecker, and the rest of the acting crew delight the audience at all times. The awesome script is brimming with humor, wackiness, and inspiration. As for the costumes, sets, and production values, they are top of the line. The final moments of the film, told in slow motion, are guaranteed to bring some lumps to anyone's throat. If you love baseball, you MUST, MUST see this film. But if you just want to laugh, cry, cheer, and feel good about life, this winning movie is for you, too. Catch it today, without delay.",9,0,1,6 April 2007
Friends with Benefits," The entertainment benefit is large in this fine film; however, the landscape of the romcom is changing and some will not like it
","Dylan (Justin Timberlake) is a dot.com designer living in the City of Angels near his ailing father (Richard Jenkins) and his sister, Annie (Jenna Elfman) and her young son. However, he is so talented at his job that he is soon 'head-hunted' by Jamie (Mila Kunis) to work for GQ magazine in New York. If Jamie can persuade Dylan to take the job, she will get a big bonus. For his part, Dylan has to be sold because he loves the west coast. But, Jamie does her recruiting well and convinces Dylan to make the change. Very soon, the two of them realize a growing attraction but since both have them have had past romantic difficulties, especially Jamie, they decide on the ground rules. There will be no commitments or expressions of love, in their future relationship, only a friendship with sexual benefits. Things get more complicated when Jamie's ditzy mother (Patricia Clarkson) comes back to stay with Jamie and Dylan's father's dementia gets worse. When Jamie goes along with Dylan on a holiday trip to Los Angeles, the future of their pact seems in danger of changing. Will they stay together or will they call it quits? This is an entertaining romcom with likable characters, nice scenery, great costumes, and good acting. Timberlake is especially surprising in his acting ability, my view, for music is surely his main pursuit. Kunis also does a good job while Clarkson, Jenkins, Elfman and all of the others are fine, too. Special praise should go to Woody Harrelson, who plays a gay colleague of Dylan's, as he does terrific work in a difficult role. So, that's that. However, this film is a far cry from the days of Pillow Talk and such. It has many explicit sexual scenes and travels a quite different path to a 'true love conquers all' conclusion. In my opinion, this is so because Hollywood is changing the romcom rules to appease male viewers who are dragged to date night films they hate. So, in place of action, there's plenty of sex. Some viewers will understand this, like me, but will still have a hard time accepting it. Therefore, those fans who prefer lighter, 'cleaner' romantic comedy will probably have to turn to Hallmark instead of Hollywood, if this film is an example of the 'future world' of light romance. I hope its not so.",Null,0,3,3 August 2011
Annie Hall," Classic, timeless, a must see for anyone, everyone
","In Manhattan, neurotic Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) is trying to figure out what caused his break-up with longtime girlfriend, Annie (Diane Keaton). True, the two were mismatches from the start. Alvy, raised in Brooklyn apartment under the Coney Island roller coaster, is Jewish and intellectual. Annie, however, from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, is a WASP who came to New York to make it as a singer and uses words like 'la di da' and 'grammy'. So, how did it begin? Divorced, Alvy met Annie at a mixed doubles tennis match. Afterwards, Annie stuttered her way into giving Alvy a ride home, where he hugged the seat in terror at her erratic driving. Yet, things develop. Alvy encourages Annie to pursue her singing career more diligently, read more books, and go to therapy. Meanwhile, Annie tries to get Alvy to enjoy life more freely and enthusiastically. But, when a record producer (Paul Simon) catches Annie's act and wants her to come to California and spend time in the studio, will it be the end? This is a classic timeless film, Allen's best, in the view of many. It is extremely funny and breathes intelligence in every frame. Allen and Keaton shine as the lovebirds while Tony Roberts, Simon, Carol Kane, and Shelley Duvall back them up nicely. In a cameo, Christopher Walken is terrifying and comical. Of course, the Manhattan setting is terrific, the quirky costumes are memorable, and the direction quite clever and varied. So, what are you waiting for? Head out to get Annie Hall, well, NOW!",10,3,6,7 August 2013
Blood Diamond," Brilliant as a diamond but way too violent for the faint of heart
","Danny (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a man who likes to live on the edge. A native of Zimbabwe, he plays both sides, delivering arms to rebel groups in war torn Sierra Leone in exchange for money, yet maintaining a relationship with the civil authorities. A journalist (Jennifer Connelly) is new to the area yet manages to nail him to the wall for his ambiguity and selfishness. However, she wants a story about the diamonds-for-guns policy that is out of control and she senses he can give her what she needs. In the meantime, a native father is anguished over his capture and subsequent slavery by the unscrupulous diamond warlords and the loss of his wife, son, and daughter to unknown circumstances. How will the lives of these three players intersect? This is a topnotch film but, it is definitely not for the faint of heart. No, even I did not make it to the end of the film, for the violence is prevalent and devastatingly real, as the movie is based on actual events. On the other hand, the acting is amazing and the African setting exotic and lovely, when the fighting pauses from time to time. Therefore, if you are drawn to films of armed conflict or films that tell the heartbreaking truth, even if it means sitting through scenes of violent inhumanity, this is a movie to consider. It has a very important story to tell and tells it well. Just make certain you can handle its virulent content and, as an added note, do prohibit anyone under 18 from being part of a showing. It has an abundance of haunting images that are hard to shake off with ease.",8,0,0,23 March 2007
Pride & Prejudice," Lovely beyond words...a colossal, monumental gift from Austen and company to the known world
","Elizabeth Bennett (Keira Knightley) is the second of five daughters, all single and young. When a new man moves into the neighborhood, all of the girls take notice. Mr. Bingley is quite rich and handsome enough, after all. At the first large party for area folks, Mr. Bingley comes to the festivity with his sister and the proud Mr. Darcy in toe. Bingley has his eye on Elizabeth's beautiful sister Jane while Mr. Darcy neither dances or talks to anyone. Although unacknowledged, however, Mr. Darcy is transfixed by Elizabeth and she is strangely drawn to him. Through a series of town meetings, country visits, and more, Elizabeth and Darcy meet again...and again. There is something stirring. Is is disgust or is it love?This classic story could not be presented better than it is this film. It is utterly lovely in every aspect, every way. The performers are just outstanding, with Knightley giving Elizabeth the fire, the mind, the sensitivity that make her such an appealing person. Mr. McF is to sigh and cry over as his Darcy is handsome, in possession of a arresting voice, and provides a display of the great depth of his own sensitive nature. The costumes and scenery are colossally stunning, as is the editing, the script (most of it is Austen's own words), and anything else that makes a movie this beautiful. Do not let another day go by before you buy a ticket or arrange any other method to watch this film. When the credits roll, your mouth will drop open in admiration as you utter that single word, 'Wow!'",10,17,29,2 December 2005
Elysium," Another Max saves the world, hooray! I liked it, yes!
","Max (Matt Damon) was an orphan as a child, growing up in a ruined City of Angels. Despite his tendencies to get into trouble, he did have a pal, a girl named Frey (Alice Braga as an adult). Now, its 2154, and after a life of petty crime, Max has gone straight, working in a factory that makes robots. Those with money and power have left the planet entirely and live in an elaborate space station called Elysium. Not only do these folks have clean air to breathe and wonderful habitations, they also have machines to cure all illnesses, in every residence. Also, as can be expected, they shoot down any rickety shuttles that try to land on Elysium. The person in charge, Secretary of Defense, is a tough as nails lady named Delancourt (Jodie Foster). She is ruthless, using an equally heartless earth-dwelling minion named Kruger (Sharlito Cooper) to help in her beat back the riffraff. She even has plans to take down the President, if he crosses her decisions! One day, Max meets Frey, unexpectedly, when his arm is broken by an over-zealous droid policeman. They make plans to meet for coffee in a few days, even though she seems reluctant. That's because her young daughter is dying of leukemia. But before this date, Max becomes locked in a room at work, due to a malfunction. He receives a lethal dose of radiation and is given five days to live. Well, its goodbye 'straight' life, as Max wants to live. Therefore, it is necessary for him to re-align with a criminal named Spider, who can get him on a shuttle to Elysium, where he can be cured by the machines. Oh, Max, its tit for tat, as Spider asks him to kidnap an Elysium leader, Max's former boss, and download the man's memory in a special chip. With this information, Spider and company can take down those in charge on Elysium and benefit everyone on earth. But, will Delancourt and Kruger allow that to happen? Also, can Max, who is given bionic arms and legs, fight them to save himself, too? This new Max, in the tradition of Mad Max, is an anti-hero with a big heart. He's just the person earth needs to work miracles for the 'little folks'. As such, Damon does a great job as the main star. Foster, too, is enormously entertaining as the Stalin sister in charge. Braga, Cooper, Diego Luna, and all of the others do fine work as well. Since the film is another in a long line of apocalyptic films, it has to have good effects, and it does! The decay on earth and the patched-together housing and vehicles are wonderful to behold. Equally fine is the glorious Elysium, which resembles a posh resort in some warm, fabulous climate. What a nice touch, too, it is to see the 'healing machines', last time I saw those, the Sun God of Stargate was keeping himself young and beautiful. Critics may charge that the film mimics other movies of a similar theme and that the ending is predictable, but this viewer says it has plenty of originality to enthrall. Elysium is a great late-summer film that will please its audiences the world over.",8,3,7,13 August 2013
Alice in Wonderland," Some kind of Wonderful, is Burton's Alice, being very imaginative and vibrant; but, purists, take heed! This is a new chapter!
","Alice (Mia Wasikowska) has been having strange dreams since childhood. Only her father could comfort her when she got scared during the night. Now, her papa has passed away and she is a 19 year old woman in the early 20th century. Her mother (Miranda Richardson) shuffles her to a party where, unknown to Alice, she will receive a proposal of marriage from a stuffy, carrot-topped Lord of England. But, at the critical moment, with the man on his knees, Alice spots a white rabbit and says she needs 'a moment' to think. Following the rabbit, she tumbles down a hole in the ground, where she ends up in Wonderland. She may have been there before! As she drinks and eats the magic juices and cakes to make her larger and smaller, she eventually gets through a locked chamber and into the forest. Immediately, she is pursued by the Bandersnatch, a striped beast, who is doing the bidding of the evil Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter). But, the dormouse saves Alice by snatching away one of the beast's eyes. Arriving at a safe place, Alice meets The Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), the Cheshire Cat, the blue caterpillar, Absolam (Alan Rickman) and the rest. At the hatter's tea party, Alice learns the current happenings in the land. The Red Queen is in total power, having defeated her younger sister, the lovely White Queen (Anne Hathaway). Aiding the royal is the black-hearted knave (Crispin Glover). They can take prisoners or utter 'off with their heads' whenever they wish. Indeed, the Red Queen has recently taken TweedleDee and TweedleDum as her own little 'fat boys', to amuse her when she wishes. Alice also learns a secret. That is, she, Alice, has the power to defeat Big Red in the near future. But, it would require an enormous act of bravery. Will she, Alice, be willing to risk everything for the kingdom? Dear purists, don't fret over this new version with endless criticisms. The film is the 'next' chapter in the life of Alice, as she herself has flashbacks of her previous trip to Wonderland as a little girl Now, ten years later, she has returned, in Burton's vision. And, what a vibrant, imaginative vision it is, for the director's Wonderland is a joy to behold, visually speaking. There is, in fact, so much detail to the settings that one would have to see the film two or three times to appreciate everything presented. Apart from the setting, the cast is truly wonderful, too. Depp, alas, has less memorable lines and scenes but, that is not his fault. In any case, he definitely has his moments and works them to highest advantage. On the other hand, Bonham Carter MAKES the film, for her Red Queen is very comical and her appearance, with a huge, lightbulb shaped head, is a scream. All of the others do fine work, too, especially Timothy Spall as Bayard, the hound. Wasikowska is effective in her first big role but is by no means a polished performer yet. As for the movie's other assets, the costumes, art direction and camera-work, they are of the highest quality. The one item that did not please me was the 'playing card' attendants to the Red Queen should not have been red! They could have had red hats and sashes but the way they are, it is difficult to tell what they are. Sorry, that's really small potatoes. IF there is anything lacking at all, it is these things. One, there is not enough humor, in my opinion, I wish there had been more. And, two, the film does 'borrow' some elements of the Wizard of Oz and, believe it or not, Titanic. However, these are no reasons to miss this flick at all. In truth, Burton's Alice in Wonderland is some kind of wonderful and its reputation will grow in the coming years.",8,2,5,10 March 2010
Avatar," If I could, I would rate it a 20.....utterly amazing and, don't think me crazy, a grand homage to Native Americans
","In the future, humans have traveled to the far reaches of the universe. On a planet called Pandora, a very important new element was discovered, one that is very valuable. But, wouldn't you know, the natives on the planet live in the forest, where most of the element is located, underground. It is the human intention to 'displace' the natives out of their woods and get to the mineral. For years, the Americans have occupied an outpost on the planet and have tried peaceful methods to reason with the aliens. The top scientist, Grace (Sigourney Weaver) learned their language and opened a 'school' to teach the native children English and the ways of the human. But, the Pandoran population truly wants none of it, for they rightly feel that their world will be destroyed. Although they have only bows and arrows, with a killing poison attached, they are very fierce. As a last resort, the Marines are trying a program of elaborate 'robots', where an earthling goes into a sort of capsule and sleeps while his 'soul' inhabits a native body. It is their hope that learning the ways of the natives will make them easier to 'conquer' and move. Now, a wheelchair-bound Marine named Jake Scully (Sam Worthington) gets a new, Pandoran body and goes with Grace and a few others on a mission. But, due to some fierce dinosaur-like creatures, Jake becomes separated from the others and is left in the forest at night. Grace believes he will surely die. He would have, too, for a powerful female warrior, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) was set to shoot him. But, some seeds from their 'tree of life' cover Jake and Neytiri sees it as an omen. She takes Jake back to her village where he is eventually accepted as a tribesman. He learns to ride the native 'horses' and 'dragons'. He and Neytiri also fall in love. But, during the night, Jake 'reports' back to the Marines when his native body is asleep. The marine commander believes he is gathering information to defeat the primitive folk. As one might guess, Jake soon realizes his new people are very worthy and should not be destroyed or moved, for their life is 'connected' deeply to the forest, their home. What will Jake do to save Neytiri and his new brothers and sisters? This is an amazing film, a stunningly visual panorama that has to be seen to be believed. The planet of Pandora is a forest like no other, with plants that 'glow' and creatures that resemble dinosaurs, wolves, and dragons. The natives, too, resemble the American Indian and other earthly tribes, such as the residents of the Amazon rain forests. Most importantly, they are 'attached' to their planet as the Native Americans were to the earth. When they kill an animal for food, they utter prayers to the animal for giving his life so that they might be sustained. They consider the destruction of any plant a blow to their own bodies. Thus, in many respects, the movie is a gigantic homage to the American Indian and their way of life. Wes Studi, who was the ultra frightening Native American in The Last of the Mohicans, even plays the Pandoran leader. But, enough of this. The actors, including Worthington, Weaver, Saldana, Ribisi, Stephen Lang and all of the rest do a fine job. The dialogue and story are, perhaps, not totally original but quite, quite adequate. However, even all these take a back seat to the incredibly imaginative scope of the film's setting, a new world far away. It is the grand scale of the forested planet that will take a viewer's breath away. In short, dear film fan, see it. Absolutely, if you can go to only ONE film this year or next, make it AVATAR. It is truly a jaw-dropping work that will overwhelm most anyone with its visionary beauty.",10,14,27,22 December 2009
Life Is Beautiful," Beautiful is far too weak a word to describe this monumentally lovely film
","Guido (Roberto Benigni) lives in pre-World War II Italy. A poor man from the country, he and a friend are going to a metropolitan area to improve their financial situation. On the way to the city, Guido catches a beautiful maiden, Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) when she falls from the second floor of a barn, due to rampaging bees. Each of them looks at the other fondly. Once in town, Guido gets a job as a waiter but, on the way to the restaurant, he loses control of his bike and, once again, smacks into Dora and ends up with his arms around her. This time, he has the courage to ask her a few questions. She is a teacher for the community and, alas, she is engaged. Yet, Guido is not deterred. He arranges to meet Dora at the opera and 'borrows' a car to take her for a ride. Dora falls hard for Guido but her parents have other plans. Nevertheless, Guido secures her hand in marriage. Flash forward several years. Now, the much-in-love couple run a bookstore and have a young son, Joshua, adding to their great happiness. But, the world is in turmoil, with the rise of Hitler and Mussolini. Since Guido is Jewish, he is eventually captured, with Joshua, and sent to a concentration camp, with gentile Dora voluntarily going along to support her husband and son. Knowing that his son is about to witness and endure unspeakable horror, Guido tells the little boy that they are entering a contest. Whoever can 'play the camp game' correctly will win a tank. But, in truth, how will the trio survive this situation? Dear viewer, beautiful is far too weak a word to describe this lovely, lovely film. The first half is extremely funny and light, with the Oscar-winning Benigni giving one of the all-time great comedic performances for the screen. Just watch him inpersonate a health inspector at Dora's school or convince a man to order a dinner already rejected by another restaurant patron and you will be smiling so wide, your face will almost break in two. Braschi is pretty and talented, too, as the object of Guido's affections and the rest of the cast is absolutely superb, also, from the young boy playing Joshua to the Nazi camp guards. The scenery is likewise lovely, in the first half, while the setting for the second half is an appropriately horrific concentration camp. The costumes, screenplay, direction, production qualities and, especially, the Oscar winning score by Nicola Piovani are beyond reproach. Yes, the story takes a sad and serious turn but, believe it or not, the humor never stops, even in the face of extreme evil. Naturally, the film has received criticism for the tale's implausibilities. But, it is undeserved, as the movie is a far too beautiful and touching piece of fiction to worry about the 'what ifs'. In summation, if you somehow missed out on a showing of this film, remember 'life is beautiful' but, it is also short. Do not hesitate another hour before committing yourself to watching one of the most uplifting, humorous, and indeed, beautiful films ever created.",10,2,4,26 March 2008
Up," Up, way up, on top of the list of best films for 2009, a touching, adventurous winner!
","Karl (voiced by Ed Asner) met and married the girl next door, Ellie. Ellie was an extroverted adventurer while Karl was a shy, reserved person but their friendship and marriage lasted a lifetime. It was Ellie's dream to follow in the footsteps of a famous world traveler, Charles (Christopher Plummer) and make her way, someday, to Paradise Falls in Venezuela. Over the years, however, Karl and Ellie, a childless couple had many home and life realities to deal with and they never made it to South America. Now, Ellie has died and Karl is forlorn. Not only that, developers want their Victorian house, the last holdout in an urban neighborhood, to be razed to make way for high rise buildings. They almost get their wish. But, at the last moment, Karl attaches a fleet of balloons to his house, lifting it in the air, and steers a course for Paradise Falls. But, wait, there's more. A talkative, tweenage scout, Russell (Jordan Nagai), who had convinced Karl to help the young lad earn a merit badge for helping the elderly, has stowed away under the house's porch and is, thus, a fellow passenger in Karl's house-airship. At first, Karl is annoyed but after they land in Venezuela, not on target, Russell helps Karl begin to move the household toward the falls. The two also encounter a trained army of dogs, who obey the commands of their long-lost-to-the-world master, Charles the explorer, who has been trying to capture an elusive, large, colorful bird, new to the known world. It seems Karl and Russell are definitely putting a spanner into his plans. What will be the outcome? This is an extremely wonderful family film, highly entertaining and very, very touching. The story is ingenious, with a flowing action that will keep everyone riveted and the animation is amazing, especially in 3-D. But, added to that mix, is a beautifully moving tale of true love, friendship, and loyalty. This viewer was in tears several times and would dare to say most others will do the same. As the voice of Karl, Asner is excellent, his gruffness hiding a caring soul. Nagai is also topnotch, very funny and very sweet as the young, lonely boy. Plummer, too, does a fine job as the 'heavy' of the movie and the lesser characters are absolutely perfect, too. In fact, this is a rarity among films, in that it is almost totally without any flaws whatsoever. If you can only see ONE film this year, make it this one. It is UP at the top, and will remain so, of the list of films for 2009.",10,1,3,3 June 2009
Groundhog Day," Oh, the lessons we can learn from a GROUNDHOG!
","Phil (Bill Murray) is a weatherman in Pittsburgh who has been sent four years in a row to cover the event known as Groundhog's Day in Puxatawney Penn. To say the least, Phil is VERY UNHAPPY and his giant ego makes him approach the project with scorn. True, this year he has a new producer, the very beautiful Rita (Andie McDowell), but even she doesn't lift the burden of boredom off his shoulders. While the rest of the crew makes due in a local hotel, Phil actually gets digs in a lovely bed and breakfast. In any case, Phil does his duty, very begrudgingly, putting up with the constant music of the Pennsylvania Polka and the ceremony of the 'little rat'. Then, a blizzard arrives. Everyone is stuck and Phil is unhappy. But, there's more. The next morning, Phil awakes to the same song as the day before, Sonny and Cher's I've Got You Babe, and finds he has to live the whole Groundhog Day experience AGAIN, even though everyone else is in happy oblivion that this is anything but the day itself. This means more polka, more little rat, more pushy insurance man trying to sell him a policy since he and Phil 'went to school together', more plain coffee at the B and B. Making it through the second reliving, Phil wakes to a THIRD GROUNDHOG DAY, again. And again and again. Will Phil come to realize that HE HAS BEEN GIVEN A CHANCE to become a better man and win the girl of his dreams? This very funny film has the greatest idea at its base. If you were given the chance to relive a fateful day, would you change your behavior for the good? In Phil's case, it takes more than one day, of course. As the into-himself-weatherman, Murray is priceless and the cast surrounding him is wonderful, too. Add on the great scenery, costumes, timeless script and sure direction and you have a movie experience that will never grow old, even with repeated viewings!",9,0,0,4 February 2018
Some Like It Hot," Hotter than hot, a volcano of laughter erupts at every view! The ultimate 'feel good' flick
","In 1929 Chicago, gangsters rule. Especially Spats Colombo (George Raft) who runs a speak-easy in the back area of a funeral home. That's where bass player, Jerry (Jack Lemmon) and saxophonist Joe (Tony Curtis) have gotten their latest gigs. On payday, though, the place is raided, with many folks arrested. J and J manage to flee, however, on the fire escape. Needing a car a day later, to drive to a job in Urbana, these two musicians unhappily end up at a garage where they witness the St. Valentine's Day massacre. Spats wants to gun them down, too, but they evade bullets and make it out when sirens approach. However, since Spats knows who they are, there will be nowhere to hide. That is, unless they disguise themselves as women and join an all-girl band on the way to Florida! Ha! Yes, Josephine and Daphne, in lipstick and heels, are reborn. Almost immediately, there are problems. Daphne's bosom becomes detached while the leader of the band, Sweet Sue, senses there is something different about these gals. However, worst of all, there is a gorgeous dame, Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) who sings and plays the ukelele. Daphne has to keep saying 'I'm a girl, I'm a girl whenever Sugar waltzes by while Joe is equally smitten. When they finally make it to Miami, Daphne becomes the object of affection for a rich millionaire, Osgood (Joe E. Brown). If Osgood succeeds in courting 'her', she could become his ninth wife. Then, Joe, itching to romance Sugar, disguises himself at off hours as another rich boy, Shell Oil Junior, and uses Osgood's yacht to find some alone time with Miss Kane. What a tangle of emotions, especially when Daphne can't dampen Osgood's ardor! Also, before long, the mobsters hold a convention in, you guessed it, Miami, with Spats front and center. What are two guys, er gals, er whatever, going to do? This hotter than hot film has been ranked the best comedy of all time and with good reason. It is downright hilarious, with a clever script of great one-liners and much physical comedy. The cast is likewise topnotch, with Lemmon and Curtis, a duo of humorous hijinks, leading the way. Monroe, too, is funny, touching, and drop dead gorgeous. Brown turns in one the most memorable character turns ever while the Raft and the rest have the audience rolling, too. Sets, costumes, and the fresh direction complete a masterpiece of mirth. Hot, cold, or lukewarm, whatever the day turns out to be, if you need the lift of laughter, this is choice number one.",10,8,11,24 November 2012
Les Misérables," Glorious production of a fantastic musical edition of Hugo's seering classic
","Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman)has been at hard labor in prison for 19 years. As evil, tortured policeman Javert (Russell Crowe) points out, it would have been five, for stealing that loaf of bread for his nephew, but Valjean's later obstinance resulted in more time to be served. Now, Jean is going somewhat free, he is released, but he must check-in with a parole officer every month for the REST OF HIS LIFE, as a dangerous criminal. Ha! Such is the miserable life for those without money in middle 19th century France. To be sure, there was a revolution but now there's another king and the life of the poor is still desperate. Meanwhile, Fantine (Anne Hathaway) is earning a pittance at a fabric mill so that she can send money to the caretakers of her young daughter, Cosette (later, Amanda Siefried), the Thenadiers (Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen). This must be done in secret, for the child is illegitimate, a huge no-no of the times. Alas, Fantine's secret is discovered, she loses her job, sinks into prostitution and poverty, and dies in Valjean's arms, who promises to find Cosette and take care of her. Jean has been in disguise for several years as the MAYOR of a town but Javert is after him again. Happily, Valjean does find Cosette, buys her from the caretakers who have used the little girl as a slave, and begins a new life in another city. Flash forward another few years. Now, Cosette is a beautiful young lady and she falls in love with a revolutionist, Marius, whose spirit is strong but whose actions may result in his death. Will Valjean be able to rescue the both of them, all the while still keeping a step ahead of Javier, who relentlessly pursues him? Wow, what a glorious film this is, made from an equally marvelous musical adaptation of Hugo's seering, timeless tale of the poor in mid-century 1800 France. The music is breathtaking and director Tom Hooper has added punch with his recording of the songs live. All of the cast is likewise wonderful, with Jackman, Crowe, Hathaway, Siefried, and all of the rest singing and acting our socks off. A special word of praise should go to Bonham Carter and Cohen for their vastly amusing yet treacherous performances. Then, too, the production is replete with fantastic art direction, costumes, sets, and photography. So, you think you hate musicals? You might do a hairpin turn into the other direction if you view this fine, fine film.",9,1,1,15 June 2013
The Da Vinci Code," This is an engrossing picture, despite its flaws
","Robert (Tom Hanks) is an expert on historical signs and symbols. Giving a lecture in Paris, he is suddenly summoned by the police to aid an investigation. It seems a gentleman at the Louvre was killed but managed to write a message in blood on his body. While giving his opinion, Robert is caught up in a very tangled cat and mouse game, along with Sophie (Audrey Tautou), between the police and other forces. Robert and Sophie's lives are at stake and so are the secrets long kept by various Catholic societies. Just what is going down? This is an interesting movie, despite its slow story and shadowy look. Hanks and Tautou are great as the souls caught in an intrigue without a compass. Paul Bettany is downright scary as a terrorist Catholic monk. The tale is a bit wandering and long and the decision to shoot the film under a cover of darkness may turn off a few viewers. But, not many. For those who read the book and, for those who did not, here is a movie that has a sensational tale to tell, no matter the final production values. Most folks who sit down to watch the film will find it a great popcorn and soda kind of affair. What is more, the film may inspire people from all faiths and backgrounds to delve more into the world of history, both of Christ and of the Catholic church. As films go, that is perhaps the crowning achievement: a viewer who wants to reflect on the movie in the days and weeks ahead.",6,1,3,26 December 2006
The Happening," This happens to be very intriguing stuff, so thank Mr. Shyamalan for his unique film crafting abilities
","Elliott (Mark Wahlberg) is a high school science teacher with talents and smarts. When discussing the strange changes in the bee world, for example, he expertly draws his students into a scientific discussion of possible causes. One day, while he is at school in the Philadelphia area, strange, terrible things start to happen in Manhattan. Men and women suddenly stop in their tracks and collapse; others jump off tall buildings, stab themselves with knitting needles, and pull out guns to commit suicide. As word spreads, Elliott and his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel) must get on a bus and travel into the interior of Pennsylvania, along with a fellow teacher, Julian (John Leiguizamo) and his little girl. Julian, however, is tremendously worried about his wife, who stays behind to check on her mother. No one knows what is going down but it looks like there is some kind of biological or chemical weapon that is being used to kill, perhaps by terrorists. All of a sudden, the bus stops and the crew tells the passengers that communication has been lost. Even more frightening, folks start to receive film on their cell phones of other acts of suicide, such as the man who jumped in the zoo's lion habitat. As Elliott and Alma hitch a ride with a trucker, Julian insists they take his daughter with them while he is going back, despite the danger, to look for his wife. Will anyone survive this 'Happening'? Wow. This is quite a special film, with an intelligent premise, a well-worded script, and a capable cast. Yes, quite a few folks think writer-director Shyamalan has gone down, in increments, since he burst on the scene with The Sixth Sense. Don't you believe it! The Village was a wonderful film and so is this one, with a unique look at the 'what if' scenarios in science. Wahlberg, Deschanel, Leguizamo and all of the cast are quite fine as the chess pieces in a horrific match. If you seek superior science fiction films or are a fan of the director, don't delay. Get The Happening before the year runs out.",8,6,12,28 March 2011
Mystic River," Fabulous film in every way, including its source material by Dennis Lehane
","In a rougher area of Boston 30 years ago, Jimmy (Sean Penn), Sean (Kevin Bacon) and Dave (Tim Robbins) are playing street hockey when the puck goes down the drain. Now without 'game', the trio starts writing their names in wet cement on a public sidewalk. Suddenly, a car pulls up....its the cops! Well, they have a badge anyway. Scaring the kids, Sean points out that he lives across the street. But, Dave, who lives one street over, is ordered to get in the car so they can talk to his parents. Crying, Dave does. However, its soon obvious to the neighbors that Dave has been abducted; he escapes four days later. Now, flashing forward, Dave and Jimmy still live in the neighborhood, with Jimmy owning a corner store and Dave doing odd jobs. Both are married and parents. Jimmy's oldest, Katie (Emmy Rossum) is nineteen and from a previous marriage. With second wife, Annabeth (Laura Linney) he has two other daughters, one who is going to have her first communion the next day. Katie works at the store and is going out on the town with two galpals. Concerned about late hours, Jimmy reminds Katie that its an important day for her sister tomorrow. Yes, Dad. But, the next day, she doesn't come to the store for the early shift and she doesn't make it to the church. Unhappily, she has been murdered and the detective on the case is Sean, who moved to a different part of Boston but is with the BPD. Naturally, Jimmy is distraught and has a gang of goons, his wife's brothers, doing their own detective work while Sean tries to reason with his former friend. There are other secrets, too. Dave, who has never been 'normal' after his abduction and molestation, came home the night of Katie's death with blood on his person. Wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) doesn't quite believe his story that he beat up a mugger. Also, Katie, unknown to all, was planning to elope with a man named Brendan Harris, who her father despises. So, what really happened one fateful night and who will pay for the crime or crimes? This fabulous movie is based on an equally fabulous novel by Dennis Lehane. Its Boston setting is seedy and beautiful at the same time and has a ring of authenticity few stories have, as Lehane was born and raised in Boston. Then, too, the actors are superb, with Penn terrifying as the tough guy Jimmy, Robbins touching as the 'damaged goods' man, and Bacon rounding out the trio in a quiet, somber performance of power. Harden, Rossum, Linney, Laurence Fishburne, and the rest are great, too.
Sets, costumes, and cinematography are wonderful as well. Add on the amazingly complicated but first-rate tale and Eastwood's terrific direction and what we have, folks, is a ten star, must-see several times movie!",10,0,1,20 February 2018
The Departed," Brutal but splendid; a plot to be admired, savored
","In South Boston, one man reigns, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). As he himself explains, he rose from poverty, little by little, to become the leader of the leading gang in SB. Naturally, he is a thorn in the side of the Boston Police and they live to bring this man down. A secret task force is formed and Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio), a cleancut boy from South Boston who has graduated from the police academy, is given the special task of infiltrating Frank's mob, pretending to be a sworn follower. This is dangerous work indeed. However, Frank has the same brilliant idea. If the gang had a plant in the police department, above reproach, then he would know when the police are coming to mess up his plans. A disciple from his teens, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is the perfect choice; he is bright, good-looking and seemingly genial. He fools most everyone, including the brass (Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg) and a psychologist (Verma Farmiga). In fact, Colin and the shrink begin a relationship while, at the same time, Cop Sullivan is relaying crucial information to Frank. As such, eventually, Billy and Colin cross paths and get suspicious of one another. Billy even goes after Colin's lady. So, whose 'traitor' in the midst will be the most successful? How many lives will be sacrificed? This brutal but splendid film is not really for the most faint of heart. Nevertheless, is ultra-fascinating plot has to be seen to be appreciated. The story even eclipses the GREAT work of Nicholson, Di Caprio, Damon, Farmiga and the entire crew. What a breathtaking twist and turn tale of betrayal and goodness. As many critics have found, this may be the ultimate Scorsese film as his hands are behind every scene. Thrillers come and go but The Departed will stay around for the ages.",9,1,2,25 March 2018
Die Hard," It's not hard to see why some folks, ho ho ho, claim this is their favorite Xmas film, it's pretty darn exciting
","John McClane (Bruce Willis) has just landed in Los Angeles at Xmas time. A New York City cop, he is going to spend the holidays near his estranged wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) and his children. Holly, a rising corporate star, was offered a high echelon job for a Japanese conglomerate and she accepted the position. This caused a deep rift between the couple, for John is a born-and-raised Big Apple resident and he doesn't want to leave the city, no matter how big his wife's salary is. Over the holidays, they are going to try to come to a resolution. Yet, when John enters the skyscraper headquarters of the Japanese company, his wife is committed to helping with the holiday party that is in full swing and he goes to a washroom to clean up. Just at that moment, a German terrorist, Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and his gang take over the building in a near-perfect seizure and the employees are turned into hostages. The German thug is after the million dollar bonds that are locked away in a heavily-fortressed vault. Meanwhile, McClane manages to slip away to the elevator shaft to spy on the crooks. It is John, then, who witnesses Hans executing the Japanese CEO when the businessman does not give the gang leader the combination fast enough. Hans, it seems, believes that the computer expert he brought with him will be able to crack the code. As it may take hours, however, John has some time to find a way to stop the killers. But, can one man really do the impossible? This is a very exciting film, with plenty of white-knuckle action and suspense. It launched the career of Willis into superstardom, of course, and spawned three sequels. As the never-say-die cop, Willis is terrific, cracking jokes as he tries to pick off the enemy one by one. Bedelia is nice, too, and the rest of the cast, including Alexander Godunov, is first rate. As for Rickman, he is superb as the cold-blooded terrorist with the eloquent voice and style. It really brought his career to the forefront, too, and his performance ranks high among those of the evil villains of film. The action takes place mostly inside a building, so there is no great scenery, but it manages to make every nook and cranny of the edifice into a battleground. Costumes are fine and the production values are high. Best of all, the script and direction are truly inspired, as the struggle between the good guys and the nasty ones is thorough and exciting. If you are looking for a movie to get you in the Christmas mood, this one may do for those twisted minds out there or, rather, for those who want a bit of action in their holiday films. So, show the children something like The Polar Express or Elf, then send them to bed, for Die Hard is strictly for adults only.",8,1,2,8 September 2008
Psycho," A classic in chills and creepiness, nuf said
","Marion (Janet Leigh) works for a real estate agent and earns, most likely, very little bucks in the late fifties. She loves a handsome gentleman named Sam (John Gavin) but, alas, his divorce has left his prospects dim, as a good deal of his money goes to his ex-wife. In fact, he lives in another California town, behind the hardware store he runs. Marion is getting tired of meeting Sam in cheap hotels and listening to his weak promises. One day, a crooked businessman comes in with $40,000 cash for a house he is buying for his daughter, who is marrying soon. Marion's boss is aghast to hold this much money so he sends Marion to the bank on a Friday afternoon. The money never gets deposited. Going a bit 'crazy', Marion takes the cash and runs north, thinking this will allow Sam to marry her. But, a heavy downpour makes Marion stop at an out-of-the-way motel, The Bates. Greeted by the motel's owner, Norman ( a superb Anthony Perkins), Marion soon learns she is the only guest and is given the best room. Norman even brings her a meal, over the objections of his mother, who Marion sees in a window and hears from the 'big house' behind the motel. After she eats, Marion decides maybe she should take the money back in the morning and steps into the shower. Suddenly and ghastly, Marion is stabbed to death by, its assumed, Norman's mother. Norman cleans the place up and sinks Marion's car, along with the money, into a pond near the motel. All too soon, Sam and Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) are looking for her. A private eye goes snooping, too, hired by the man with the bucks, for he can't notify the police. When the PI gets to the Bates, Norman's mother makes short work of him, too. Another car goes swimming and sinks. But, when Sam and Lila likewise trail Marion to the Bates, will more deaths ensue? Is there bigger secrets afoot? You bet! This classic tale of a psychosis and murder is rightly one of Hitchcock's most famous films. DEFINITELY SCARIER THAN SCARY, many folks never take a shower again after viewing it. Perkins is beyond great as the weird Norman and Leigh, Gavin, and Miles do their parts quite nicely. The twist at the end is compelling while, even in black and white, the film's production is stunning. Don't miss this one if you dare!",10,2,2,3 July 2019
The Holiday," Happy Holidays to the planet's female population
","Amanda (Cameron Diaz) is a high strung owner of a LA company that makes movie trailers. She has a nice looking live-in boyfriend but, alas, he cheats on her. And, it's almost Christmas. Meanwhile, in England, Iris, a journalist, learns that the man she has devoted herself to, for the last three years, is becoming engaged to someone else. Both of these gals need a holiday to recover from their losses. On the Internet, there is a website devoted to home swapping, as both Iris and Amanda discover. Getting off their respective continents sounds mighty good to these lovelorn gals. They do it. Amanda heads to England and Iris goes to the City of Angels. Unexpectedly, Amanda meets a good looking guy who happens to be Iris' brother Graham (Jude Law) while Iris runs into a nice composer named Miles (Jack Black). Neither lady is looking for romance, having been burned so recently. But, life is what happens when you are busy making other plans, no? This is a movie that will probably resonate with females more than with males, no doubt about it. If this seems unfair criticism, so be it. After all, is every female out there lining up to see Jackass II? We gals deserve a nice romcom, now and then and this year's movie entries have been pitifully few, in this category. All of the principal actors here do a very charming job, with Black a surprising choice as a love interest, a choice that works out nicely. There is plenty of nice dialogue, nice costumes, nice scenery, and nice situations. One inspired concoction is the 'trailers' Amanda sees for her own life as it unfolds. At times, the whole affair seems just a touch forced but this does not really make the film unlovable. Women, do yourself a favor this holiday. Go treat yourself to a matinée of this pleasant film and visit the local tea shoppe afterwards, for a topper. This movie was made for ladies everywhere to cherish like a beautiful Christmas package, wrapped up in red and gold, and holding a surprising, but very welcome gift, inside.",6,0,1,10 December 2006
Crazy Heart," Crazy you would be, to skip this one....Jeff Bridges is incredible!
","Bad Blake (Jeff Bridges) is an aging, hard-living, boozing country music singer. Once a bonafide star and an excellent song writer, he has fallen on hard times. This is mostly due to his alcoholism, as it makes him unreliable to deliver a worthy concert performance. Now booked at bowling alleys, he is one testy character, for he knows what a truly great singer he really is. Bad is particularly annoyed that another singer he befriended and introduced, Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell), is currently doing far better than he, Bad, is. Also noteworthy among his failures are Bad's four marriages, which ended in divorces, and his many, many one-night stands. Now, however, he meets a young reporter, Joan (Maggie Gyllenhaal) when she corners him after a gig in New Mexico. She is pretty and spunky and is a single mother to a preschool boy. Although unexpected and unlikely, the older singer begins a relationship with the lovely writer. But, can it last? Also, Bad accepts an offer to open for Tommy at a concert in Phoenix, although Blake is definitely upset that his headlining days are gone. However, will it result in a career resurgence? This is an excellent film, despite some similarities to other movies. The reason is Bridges, for his performance is stellar and so is his singing. He truly 'loses' himself in the role so that the viewer sees only Blake, not the actor giving him life. Also, the supporting cast is quite wonderful, with Gyllenhaal, Robert Duvall, Farrell (his role is small but, hey, he can sing, too!), and the rest doing great work. Then, too, the settings, costumes, story, direction, production values, and, especially, the music are topnotch. In short, you would be 'crazy' indeed to skip this one. Its a heck-of-a-story and a heck-of-a-performance from Bridges, too.",9,2,3,15 February 2010
Love Actually," Actually, love, this film is warm and funny...but do note the R rating
","It is nearing Christmastime in England. The new bachelor prime minister (Hugh Grant) is meeting his appointed staff, including a lovely aid named Natalie. His sister (Emma Thompson) is making a lobster costume for the Christmas play and wondering about the fidelity of her husband (Alan Rickman). Meanwhile, a writer (Colin Firth) has come home to find his wife having an affair with his brother. He takes off for a holiday in France and meets a lovely housekeeper. Elsewhere, a young couple have just been married, an aging rock star is attempting a comeback, a nerdy young man is going to off to find love in Wisconsin, a recent widower is dealing with a confused stepson, and a radio network employee (Laura Linney) is smitten with a coworker. Will this be a happy holiday for everyone? Well, just about! This lovely film has many, many story lines but they all work and they all receive enough attention to satisfy the viewers. The film is quite humorous and humane, giving out smiles and sighs with aplomb. All of the actors do their jobs very well and should be commended for making what will probably be a classic in holiday films and in British film-making. One caveat, however. The film got a deserved R rating for language and for one plot line that involves body doubles doing sexual situations for the film industry. Alas, if these two things were eliminated, the film could be recommended for viewing without hesitation. As it is, the film is not suitable for anyone under 18, without extreme guidance. Or, wait. Doesn't the film show up on television from time to time, with some scenes edited? Instead of getting the movie at the local video store, this viewer recommends taping it right from network television. The movie will still retain its funny and sweet story but will be the cleaner, more suitable family version. For, in truth, the film has so many wonderful moments, it would be a shame for anyone to miss seeing the film, actually.",7,0,2,2 January 2007
Edge of Tomorrow," Amazing film, in concept and in visual majesty; one of Cruise' best performances ever
","Major Cage (Tom Cruise) has been sent to Britain from America to chronicle and film the battles against an alien enemy, the Mimics, who have overtaken Europe. As England fears the huge, insect-like aliens will soon cross the Channel, they are preparing another D-Day invasion. Astonishingly, Cage has never been trained in battle, despite his rank, as he is an information specialist. Yet, the General in charge of the invasion expects Cage to lead soldiers on the field. He can't, he explains. Soon, the General orders Cage's arrest, the American is stripped down to the rank of private, and ordered to a squadron of paratroopers. The invasion is the next day and Cage, in an elaborate suit of armor he knows nothing about, will take part. The result is ghastly, Cage is overcome with fright and sees the fearsome aliens mow down one soldier after another. But, there's a twist. As Cage fires on an exceptionally large alien, called an Alpha, the human is covered in Alpha blood as they both die. In the next moment, Cage is back in time to the point of his discovering himself to be a private and hauled off to meet the squadron. Again. Along the way, he meets an exceptional soldier, Rita (Emily Blunt), who has destroyed many of the Mimics by herself. She explains why. IF you receive alien blood, even on the surface, you are part of Einstein's fourth dimension, time. Therefore, you now have the ability to 'loop back' indefinitely and learn from each encounter on how to fight the Mimics and take them down. As Cage and Rita live, die, and repeat, will they be successful in freeing the Earth of these hideous Mimics? What a thrill ride this movie is! No, the concepts aren't totally original but borrowed and embellished very well and the visuals of the movie are majestic. How terrifyingly real are these aliens and how epic each battle is. Cruise has rarely been better, from scared civilian to strong fighter and Blunt is equally fine and regal. Even a casual sci-fi fan will be enthralled by this one!",9,2,3,31 March 2019
Pitch Perfect 2," Not perfect but silly, girly fun with enchanting vocal performances
","Beca (Anna Kendrick) and the rest of the Bellas, an acapella college troupe, are still singing up a storm. A new frosh, Emily (Hailee Steinfeld) begs her way into the group as well, with her lovely voice. But, Beca has some secrets. As a senior, she has to plan for her future and takes a clandestine internship for a major recording company. Also, Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) is being courted by a member of a male vocal group but doesn't give any indication that she is smitten with the gentleman. Then, horror arrives! The Bellas are kicked out of a national competition on a technicality. Their only chance at redemption is to win an INTERNATIONAL battle of singing, in Denmark. Their competition is very good, especially a German ensemble who has been touring the States. To help prepare, the gals go to a spa-type camp for meditation and focus. Will these Bellas regain their crowns? This is a sometimes silly flick, but the singing is tremendous while the gals are funny entertainers. Kendrick is extremely talented but she is getting a bit too old to play a college gal. Steinfeld will take over the star spot nicely in any sequels. Naturally, the costumes, sets, and photography are quite eye-catching. If you loved Pitch Perfect One, there is no reason you won't enjoy this sequel. Other viewers, who didn't catch the first round, will still laugh and cheer over this one, too. Just don't expect a perfect movie and you should be nicely entertained for a couple of hours.",7,3,6,16 June 2015
"Hail, Caesar!"," A Happy Hail to the Coens; not their best but very enjoyable
","Hollywood in the Fifties is a never-ending grind if you are Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin). As the go-to guy for Capitol Movie Studios, Eddie has many a tangle to smooth. First, the studios need a 'star' replacement for an elegant period piece but the only one available is singing cowboy Hobie (Alden Ehrenreich). Although the head honcho insists on this substitute, poor Hobie is a stretch for the role, irritating famed director Lawrence Laurents (Ralph Fiennes). Then, water ballet film star DeeAnna (Scarlet Johansson) is a divorcée with a big problem; she's pregnant and unmarried. But these two issues are small peanuts when handsome major actor Baird (George Clooney) gets kidnapped before his final big scene in a Biblical epic Hail Caesar. In addition, Lockheed Air is after Eddie, too, as his managerial skills are priceless. Ransom is set at $100,000. Amid twin sister gossip writers (Tilda Swinton) breathing over Mannix's shoulder, a cutting room editor (Frances McDormand) smoking and choking, Baird's hoped-for return, and Eddie's daily trips to confession, will the show go on at Capitol Studios? This clever, interesting and funny film is not the Coens best but still very enjoyable. The cast is the major asset, with Brolin on top as the man who keeps it all running. Johansson, McDormand, Clooney, Fiennes, Swinton, Jonah Hill, Ehrenreich, Channing Tatum and ALL of the rest are just fantastic. The recreation of the Fifties is also superb in costumes, sets, themes, sight gags, send-ups, and more. Finally, as the principal writers and directors, the Coens are worthy of much praise for their risk taking ventures, even when it all doesn't QUITE result in matchless film making. A Happy Hail to the Coens, absolutely. May they never cease crafting their works until its impossible for them to move.",8,2,5,10 February 2016
American Gangster," A powerful story, and not swagger and violence, make this a great film
","Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) moved to Harlem at an early age, where he worked for a crime boss. As the mobster's right hand man, he got a taste for power and for coming out on top. When the aging boss dies, the power shifts to Frank and he vows to be the 'master of the universe' in his corner of New York City. Being extremely intelligent and ruthless to those who oppose him, Frank does what it takes to make his dream come true. He transports his brothers and other relatives from North Carolina to Harlem, for he can count on their loyalty to execute the workings of his master plan. Then, he travels to Asia himself and strikes deals with the Oriental exporters of heroin, guaranteeing a potent, superior drug and no 'middlemen' to siphon off the profits. With the purest form of heroin and the lowest prices available, Frank's gang pulls in astronomical profits of the streets of Harlem. Frank lives like a king, with a most beautiful, pageant-winning Puerto Rican bride. But, there is one man poised to take him down. That would be Richie (Russell Crowe), a super-honest cop of the New York City police department. Richie once turned in a million dollars he found on the street, without taking a penny. When the drug laws enforcement agency of the United States comes calling, they nab Richie to head a cadre of officers dedicated to tracking down the kingpins in the drug traffic in NYC and putting them behind bars. With two hurricane-force men about to face off in a colossal test of will and power, who will be left standing? This is a great film, replete with very fine performances and a sensational tale. The acting crew of Washington, Crowe, Josh Brolin, Ruby Dee, and all of the others are made-to-order perfect in their designated roles. But, it is the story itself and the recreation of Harlem in the seventies that is even more impressive. Here is a world where the rules of middle town America do not apply and everyone must step to a different tune, one dictated by those who have the control. Ridley Scott, the director, as he did in Blade Runner, makes this lost world come to life brilliantly. There is some violence, yes, but just enough to show the reality of the situation and nothing in excess. Therefore, if you are thinking of another Scarface, you will be disappointed. As for the look of the film, it's costumes, sets, and cinematography, they are all beyond reproach. In short, this is a memorable film that tantalizes the viewer from beginning to end. Get the gang together and go buy your tickets ASAP.",8,2,8,4 November 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," An unusual, but never mundane, film....Ferrell is excellent!
","Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is an IRS agent obsessed with numbers. He brushes his teeth a certain number of times each day, walks the same number of steps to catch the bus, and does complex multiplication in his head with great ease. One day, however, he hears someone 'narrating' his life as he goes about this daily existence. He consults a psychiatrist who suggests schizophrenia. But, Harold knows he is not going crazy and, instead, turns to a literature expert (Dustin Hoffman) to help him make sense of the voice. Then, too, Harold is struck by some of the narrator's words and he realizes he is missing some of the big assets of life, such as love. He is smitten with a lovely baker, who he is supposed to be auditing, and he goes for broke in the romance department. It works in his favor. But, wait a minute. The narrator suddenly predicts Harold's death. Does poor Mr. Crick have any hope in avoiding his own demise? This is an out-of-the-ordinary movie, to say the least. It has wonderful messages about living life to the fullest but it's own construction is somewhat awkward and misconstrued. The idea of Harold being a character is someone else's book is difficult to fathom and does not quite work in the final analysis. That being said, Ferrell is absolutely wonderful as the man who needed a running commentary on his life to discover new possibilities in living. The rest of the cast, including Hoffman, Emma Thompson, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Queen Latifah, is also very nice. Production values, including costumes, setting and photography, are more than adequate. If you want to see a film that is a far cry from the formulaic, this is the one to choose. The story may not be entirely successful, but with Ferrell in the lead and the other fine cast members in tow, a viewing of this film will take you to the brave new world of intriguing film making.",6,0,2,23 January 2007
The Reader," Incredibly moving, incredibly controversial....college classrooms could benefit greatly from a showing, as would most every adult
","Michael Berg (David Kross) is an almost-16 year old German secondary student who is very, very ill. On his way home from school, he stops in an alley to relieve his stomach and shiver madly during a torrential downpour. Fortunately, a woman, Hanna (Kate Winslet), who lives in an old building spies him, helps clean up after him, and makes certain he gets home. Back with his family, a doctor arrives and declares that the teen has scarlet fever and must stay in bed for a couple of months. Once recovered, Michael mentions to his mother the lady who helped him on the street and mama insists that Michael take her flowers. Remembering the apartment building, the teenager does so. Hanna, very surprised to see him, is ironing her clothing, including her under garments. Michael is intrigued, for Hanna is very beautiful, even if she is 20 years his senior. On the next visit, protocol is thrown to the wind and the older woman puts the moves on the shy Michael, resulting in a torrid affair. Hanna, especially, begs Michael to 'read to her', everything from Homer to Chekhov to Tintin. Lovely Hanna works hard as a money-taker for the trolley but, after weeks of meetings, Michael convinces Hanna to go on a 'bike holiday' with him. Bliss is too weak a word to convey their mutual affections but it is short lived. One day, Hanna has packed up and gone and Michael is disconsolate. Flash forward several years. Now Michael is a law student and his class is attending a local trial of six former prison guards at Nazi camps. Astonishingly and tragically, Michael learns Hanna is one of them. Despite Michael's suspicions that Hanna is illiterate, the former beauty is given the harshest sentence, life in prison, for she claims she wrote the camp's reports. She is gone from sight forever. But, Michael can not forget her. Now grown-up (Ralph Fiennes takes over) and divorced, Michael records books, including their favorites, on tapes and sends them to Hanna in prison, where she is astonished and gratified to get them. But, will the two lovers ever see each other again? This is a powerhouse of a film, incredibly moving and incredibly controversial. While the storyline is intricate, it is still basically an exploration of what is good and what is evil and if there is anything 'gray' in-between the two. Specifically, can an illiterate German woman, trying to support herself, take a job in the SS, follow orders, send Jews to their death and be anything other than a monster? With this highly volatile premise, there is bound to be controversy and one can not imagine a Jewish person, especially a Holocaust survivor, having anything but one opinion only, with good cause. Yet, the movie presents evidence to support both sides. As the principal stars, Winslet, Kross, and Fiennes are magnificent and well worth any accolades and prizes coming their way. It is even more astonishing to realize that Winslet gave another knockout performance this year in Revolutionary Road, as well and that Kross was a mere 18 when filming began! The scenery, too, is lovely, as are the costumes, musical score, script and direction. Due to the sexual nature of the film, it is unsuitable for anyone under 18. But, this movie is a true lightning rod for the brain and for the heart and should be seen by every discriminating movie attender.",10,2,4,11 March 2009
The Wrestler," Behind the 'fake' world of professional wrestling, life is all too real... this is an excellent but monumentally sad film
","Randy 'Ram' (Mickey Rourke) was a superstar in the world of professional wrestling, where all of the moves are choreographed and blows are 'faked'. Now, 20 years later, Randy is still at it, but his arenas are a lot smaller. All of the muscle-enhancing drugs, accidental injuries, late hours and the like have taken a heavy toll on the 'Ram' and he has a bad ticker. Consequently, Randy appears in two-bit shows and his pay is comparatively low. On the Jersey shore, he lives in a rundown trailer park, where the owner locks him out of his own home if the rent is late. Nevetheless, Ram still tries to keep his long, flowing blonde locks touched up at the beauty salon and he visits the tanning salons, too, to keep that healthy, robust 'look'. Mostly a loner, Randy is trying to acquire more permanent interpersonal connections. His long-neglected daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) lives nearby and dad is trying to patch things up with her, although she is still harboring a great deal of resentment toward him. In addition, Randy has fallen for a local stripper, Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) who, like him, is getting to old to continue her line of work but who has her eyes on a dream home in a nice Jersey suburb. Cassidy, also, resists his advances, saying continually that she doesn't get involved with 'clients'. Sad. Now, after a horrific local battle, where Ram is bloodied and stapled, he ends up in the hospital where doctors tell him he MUST leave the wrestling business or he will end up taking a dirt bath. Will he find a new direction in life? This is a terrific film, but so monumentally sad that I cried buckets. As a person who knew nothing of the world of professional wrestling, my eyes were opened to the horrors of a 'sport' where fans dictate the dance steps and the wrestlers, despite receiving some fame, brutally abuse their bodies and their minds. As Randy, Rourke is so wonderful that his performance easily towers over almost everyone else's in cinema this year. His tough but touching turn is the stuff of legends. Likewise, Tomei is pretty amazing, too, in her role as a dancing stripper, and not only because she still looks great. Wood and all of the other supporting cast members fulfill their roles nicely, too. The seedy venues, the outrageous costumes and the great camera work present a penetrating look into the world of wrestling and should be lauded as well. As for the script and direction, they are topnotch and illuminating, too. In brief, don't miss The Wrestler, for it shines a harsh light on the 'athletes' caught up in the tawdry universe of professional wrestling and, indeed, of the poorer echelons of society. But, be prepared to pass the tissue box around, as they say, when you sit down for a view.",9,1,1,4 February 2009
Hancock," Has some good elements, but never quite makes sense; special effects are very fine
","Hancock (Will Smith) is NOT your average superhero. Yes, he has powers that probably exceed Superman, Spiderman and just about any other magical crime fighter. But, he lives like a homeless man, drinks like a fish, and uses foul language in his efforts. Although he has saved lives in the Los Angeles area, he has also destroyed property. The powers that be, and the common folk alike, sneer at him. One day, however, he saves the life of a public relations officer, Ray (Jason Bateman) whose car is stuck on a train track. Its quite a rescue since Ray's car ends upside down. Although all bystanders make fun of Hancock, Ray thanks him heartily and takes him home to dinner. Once there, Hancock awes Ray's son, Aaron, but doesn't impress the PR man's gorgeous wife, Mary (Charlize Theron). Strange, since he saved her hubby's life. As Hancock wolfs down his plate of spaghetti and meatballs, Ray offers his help. What Hancock really needs, says Ray, is an image change. If he stops drinking and swearing and even goes to jail, briefly, for the havoc he has caused, the superhero can be loved and appreciated again. What a concept! Hancock actually agrees to the plan and ends up in jail, where he refuses to use his powers, except on the basketball court. But, when Mary and Aaron visit, Hancock is confused about his feelings for Ray's wife. Mary is, in fact, harboring secrets, which spill out in good time. These hidden truths could change the lives of Ray, Mary, Aaron, Hancock and the world. What will happen? This is an entertaining film, thanks to nice performances by the principal three actors and great special effects. Smith is always a charmer, Theron is a lovely and fine actress and Bateman's surprises with his 'nice guy' turn, without a bit of sarcasm. As stated, the effects are a huge bonus, with cars ending up on top of skyscrapers, basketballs going through hoops acres away from the shooter and the like. Nevertheless, it can't be considered a bonafide winner for a few reasons. One, the plot is imaginative but doesn't truly make sense and falls flat near the end. Then, too, parents will not be pleased with the initial appearances of Hancock, where he is guzzling booze from a fifth, using bad language and showing little respect for anyone. Since Hancock does undergo a nice reformation, older children will benefit if parents watch the film with them. Indeed, the lessons of Hancock on living a 'decent life' are one of the best aspects of the entire movie. Therefore, if you are a fan of the cast, science fiction, and/or superhero flicks, get Hancock soon.",Null,1,2,12 October 2011
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," As with Hobbit 2, I watched this with family who chose it, not me; it is, nevertheless, entertaining, scary and more
","Picking up after Hobbit 2, the dragon has been tricked into giving up his gold and he is very angry. Therefore, he decides to punish Laketown again and burn it to the ground, killing all. However, Bard (Luke Evans) has a magic arrow and one chance to fell the fire- breathing beast. He does so, hooray! But, some have been killed and part of the town lost. Now, however, there is a new threat. Thorin (Richard Armitage), the leader of the dwarfs, does NOT want to honor his promise to share the treasure. This leads to a great battle of five armies, including the cretin-like Orcs, dimwitted but strong. Gandolf cannot immediately help, as he has been captured by a powerful necromancer. Yet, the eagles free him and the armies begin fighting. Which army will prevail? Who knows, but Bilbo just wants to go home. This exciting 'last chapter' has some strong scenes of violence, which may not be suitable for the youngest viewers. Especially impressive is a battle on an icy, mountainous terrain. In general, good defeats evil and it is a joy to watch Bilbo (Martin Freeman) return to his meadow home, only to find he must stop the auctioning of his possessions, as the town gave him up as lost forever. Having seen the world, Bilbo rests peacefully in his rocking chair, with a special memento from his journey, a memento which will be important later. Again, actors, scenery, costumes, story, and direction are entertaining. No, these fantasies are most likely not the 'cup of tea' for all but don't miss out if you get the chance to view it.",7,0,0,27 November 2017
Inception," Would you even dream of skipping this heady, tantalizing, brilliant film, movie fans? I say no way on earth
","Cobb (Leonard DiCaprio) has an interesting 'job' in the near future. If someone wants to beat out the competition in business, they hire Cobb to infiltrate the competitor's dream cycle and steal his or her's inventive ideas. Whew! This is such a complicated strategy that Cobb has a sidekick (Joseph Gordon Levitt) to help him in his work. Now a Japanese corporate giant (Ken Watanabe) wants desperately to destroy his Rupert Murdoch-like rival's son (Cillian Murphy) but has doubts on whether Cobb can work his evil strategies. Therefore, Cobb pushes the envelope. The dream stealer assures the Asian strongman that he can perform 'inception', that is, he can plant a destructive idea into the rival's brain, during an elaborate dreamscape, and the man will bring himself down. Once again, whew! But, with the stakes so high, Cobb has to gather more assistants, including architect Ariadne (Ellen Page), a male expert on sleep-inducing drugs, and so on. These folks, willing to help, all warn Cobb, however, that failure is likely, for no one has truly been successful at inception before. Ah, but, that's the secret, for someone has and its Cobb. Complicating matters is Cobb's own nightmares about his ex-wife (Marion Cotillard) who not only committed suicide but made it look like Cobb had murdered her. Thus, the dream stealer hasn't seen his two children in months, as he is on the run and can't re-enter the United States. As part of the deal, if Cobb's plans for inception work, he will get a clean slate. Will he be able to deliver? This is a tantalizing film, very heady stuff, that is extremely hard to summarize but which rivets the viewer as all outstanding movies can. Part of its greatness lies in the terrific cast. DiCaprio, fresh out of two fantastic performances in Revolutionary Road and Shutter Island, completes the trilogy with another knockout turn here. He's always had 'the goods' but his youthful appearance and teeny bopper fans interfered with directors taking him seriously. No more. Cotillard, too, is mesmerizing, for she is beautiful, voluptuous and so, so talented. The rest of the crew is also terrific, with special words of praise for Watanabe, Murphy and, in a very small role, Micheal Caine. The only cast member that seems slightly miscast is Page, but, hey, she makes it work, with a wit and spark that resembles Robert Downey, Jr., pint-sized. But, in addition to the well-chosen cast, the film has very few weaknesses. The story (by writer/director Christopher Nolan), is superb, although complicated, the direction is fast and furious, and the visual effects, including costumes, settings, and stunning camera shots, all work to a powerful end. Would you even dream of skipping this film, serious film fans? I say, no way, Jose. Like the postal service, let no rain, snow, sleet, or dread of night keep you from buying a ticket.",10,4,10,18 July 2010
Murder on the Orient Express," Christie fans, take the express to see this new, lovely version of a classic
","Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh, who also directed) is, by his own admission, the world's greatest detective circa 1930. Its true. Using his 'little gray cells' he has solved some unsolvable crimes. At the start of the film, in Israel, Poirot discovers who stole a rare, bejeweled artifact and it wasn't a rabbi, priest, or iman, as suspected. Now, Mr. Hercule just wants to get back to London. His mode of transportation is the famous Orient Express, from Istanbul to Paris. On board, he meets kind folks like Mary (Daisy Ridley), a governess, Dr Arbuthnot (Leslie Odom, Jr.), the grand Mrs. Hubbard (Michelle Pfeiffer), a Princess (Judi Dench), among others, and a man described as most unpleasant, Mr. Ratchet (Johnny Depp). In fact, when Ratchet finds out Mr. Poirot is on the train, he asks him for a huge favor. Ratchet, a self-described art dealer, insists someone is trying to 'off' him and wants Hercule to protect him. Poirot says no, for he has his doubts about who Ratchet truly is. As the train passes through mountains, an avalanche stops the train in the early morning and it is soon discovered Ratchet was murdered in the night, even though he slept with a gun. It appears his late night coffee was drugged. One of the first things brought to life, too, was that the dead man's name wasn't Ratchet, but Cassetti, and as such, was the kidnapper/murderer of a young girl, Daisy Armstrong, some years before. One by one, Poirot interviews the rest of the passengers, trying to find a killer. Could it be his secretary, McQueen (Josh Gad), who was stealing money from his boss? Or perhaps it was the Austrian professor (Willem Dafoe) who seethes with hatred for others? The culprit, whom Poirot DOES uncover, is almost beyond belief! Who done it? Thie classic tale is a feast for the eyes and ears. The scenery is breathtaking and the script witty, amid the horror. Then, too, the cast is superb, each doing fine work, especially Branagh as Poirot. Needless to say, the costumes are likewise wonderful as they recreates the garb of the thirties. Perhaps the only criticism might be leveled at the pace, as it is slow at times. Nevertheless, discerning movie goers will want to EXPRESSLY make a date to view it.",8,8,22,11 November 2017
Arrival," Challenging film, with great performance by Adams; most worthwhile
","Louise (Amy Adams) is a professor of linguistics and very well respected. In fact, when the US Army needed some translation of Farsi, she did the task in no time. Yet, it appears she has recently lost her only child, a daughter named Hannah, and the grief is still showing. One day, twelve alien spaceships land on earth, very scattered between the continents. As everyone is apprehensive about their purpose, including those at the university, classes are cancelled indefinitely. Yet, an army officer, Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) shows up at Louise's office once more. With him is a recording of the aliens' language and he wants a translation. Whoa. Telling him she would need much more time and additional tapes, the colonel takes Louise to the spaceship that is in Montana. It is there that she meets an astrophysicist, Ian (Jeremy Renner) and the rest of the crew. Weber informs Louise and Ian that every day, a door of the ship opens for a few hours and they are face to face with the aliens, a many legged being. Thus, Louise and Ian will be front and center in finding a way to communicate with the aliens and, more importantly, find out if they come in peace or destruction. After trying to interpret the whale like sounds, Louise gets another idea. Perhaps they could talk via written language so she brings in a dry erase board. IT WORKS! The aliens are soon making their own circular language patterns. But, as they still need to be decoded completely, will Louise succeed before the rest of the world goes into attack mode? In addition, why is she having strange dreams about her daughter at various stages of her life? This exceptionally challenging and intelligent film is a mind-blower. With nary a light saber in sight, its a fearful yet enchanting meeting of two planetary species. The three main cast members, Adams, Renner and Whitaker, are truly wonderful, especially Adams, who owns the movie. It is her determination, smarts, and empathy that contributes to the search for meaning. Then, too, the alien ships and their beings are wonderfully imaginative, in particular the written alien language. Even so, the ending has to be pondered, as it is deliberately vague. But, for all thoughtful movie fans, Arrival is an immense journey that everyone should take.",9,3,13,6 December 2016
The Blind Side," No one will be blind to the beauty of this true and very inspirational story, Michael Oher is a genuine hero
","Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) has just had the 'good fortune' to be accepted into a private, Christian school in Memphis. Once the football coach got a glimpse of 'Big Mike', he was determined to get the teenager enrolled, for the lad is very tall and very broad. But, unknown to everyone, Michael has had a difficult life up to this very moment. He has been in and out of foster homes for years, after the authorities discovered his mother's drug habit and his father's absence. At the present, he is living at the all-night laundromat, where each night he washes out his two shirts. The teachers at the school learn Michael is bright but can not read or write well. Alas, too, the other pupils don't extend the hand of friendship. One day, however, an elementary student named SJ strikes up a conversation with Michael that makes the big guy smile. Later that night, SJ and his parents, Leigh Anne (Sandra Bullock) and Sean Tuohy (Tim McGraw) are driving home from a school event when they spy Mike, coat-less, walking out in the cold. When Leigh Anne learns SJ knows the teen, she insists on asking Michael to come home with them for the night. Learning a few necessary facts, Leigh Anne and Sean soon invite Michael to stay with them as long as he wants. Before many weeks have passed, Michael is a part of the family and has his own room and some new clothes. The Tuohys also help Michael with his school work so that he will be able to make the football team. But, will Michael's past come back to haunt his relationship with his new, loving family? This is an outstanding movie that is very touching and very inspirational. Michael Oher is one truly courageous and hard-working athlete who opened his heart to a new family and a new life when he met the Tuohys. Yes, this rich Memphis couple deserve much praise, also, for their efforts to turn Michael's existence in a new direction. But, only Michael could have made the extreme changes and dedication that allowed him to flourish, on the football field and in school. Bravo, Michael, bravo and more. As the principal characters, Bullock, McGraw, Kathy Bates and especially Aaron are most wonderful. All of the lesser actors are very fine, too. The setting in Memphis is authentic, from the worst side of town, where Michael was born, to the best, where the Tuohys reside. Costumes and production values are terrific, as are the script and surefooted direction. In short, make certain that you include time for you and yours to see this absolutely winning movie. No one will be blind to the beauty of its tale of love and triumph.",9,1,2,15 December 2009
Music and Lyrics," Delivers a happiness high note, there will not be a better romantic comedy this year or next
","Alex (Hugh Grant) was a member of a popular eighties band called Pop. The group had a successful run but split when the man who wrote their songs' lyrics went solo. Now, Alex makes appearances at amusement parks and fairs, doing his old songs in front of fans that are growing older but are still adoring. Suddenly, his longtime agent gets a request from the hot-and-now girl of music, Cora; she wants Alex to write a new song, just for her. Seems Cora loved Pop and Alex when she was younger. The trouble is, Alex is a great composer but, by his own admission, a weak lyricist. When the new plant caretaker, Sophie (Drew Barrymore) arrives at his apartment, Alex is brainstorming with a gloomy lyrics writer, trying to get started on the new song called The Way Back Into Love. Sophie throws out a few possible verses, almost without realizing what she is doing. Alex immediately sees he has a chance to complete the song with her help. Will she do it? And, is there more a stir between the two of them than merely completing a song? This is a lovely, funny, and touching romantic comedy. Grant is a marvel as the aging star, not only because his humor is always charming but, also because he can sing well! Very well, as a matter of fact. Barrymore, who holds her own in the singing department, too, is likewise funny and sweet as the lady who finds the heart can open up again to possibilities. Campbell Scott, an always welcome performer, does a nice little turn as a dastardly former boyfriend of Sophie's. Then, too, newcomer Haley Bennett is a find as the young singer, Cora; she is lovely and sings like a lark. All of a movie's usual assets, such as nice costumes, good sets, and high production values, are present. On top of that, the music in the film is first rate. In fact, the main song, The Way Back Into Love, is beautiful and should be nominated for awards. Therefore, besides high tailing it to the movies to see this gem, stop at the music store on the way back home. You will really want the soundtrack resonating with you in the weeks and months ahead, too.",9,1,2,16 February 2007
Despicable Me," Me likes! Me wants to tell you to see it, too!
","Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) is rather despicable. If the line at the coffee shop is too long, he whips out his 'freeze gun' and turns everyone into large ice cubes while he rushes to the front position, among other shady deeds. An inventor of devices for criminal pursuits, his underground laboratory houses his partner, Dr. Nefarious (Russell Brand) and a virtual army of darling, intelligent little robots. From there, they work out their strategies, such as stealing a replica of the Statue of Liberty from Vegas. Ho, ho what a feat! Now, however, they have a rival, Vector (Jason Segel). This young whippersnapper made off with one of the actual pyramids of Giza, leaving a blown-up, balloon model in its place. Vec also pilfered the world's first 'shrinking' machine, which Gru coveted in his quest to steal the moon. Is Gru and his team slipping? Even his own mother (Julie Andrews) makes fun of him! Heading over to Vector's place for a confrontation, Gru can't break into the heavily guarded and inventively fortressed abode. But, when he spies three little orphan girls gain entrance, selling cookies, Gru gets an even more despicable idea. He will 'adopt' these wee gals and use them to infiltrate Vec's place, nabbing the shrink gun. What he doesn't suspect is that his new daughters, Agnes, Margo and Edith, will actually start pulling on his own heartstrings! Will Gru stay despicable forever? This darling film has a wagonload of assets and will please most every viewer. First, Carell is simply brilliant as Gru, will he be even considered at Oscar time for an animated role? I hope so! The supporting cast is also truly terrific, with Segel, Will Arnett, Andrews, and especially Brand doing great work. Brand is a complete surprise, by the way, with a part that is far removed from his more typical film roles. The voices of the three little girls are also delightful. Next, the animation is sensational, being vibrant, creative, and, artistically, topnotch. In short, its awesome. Then, too, the tiny, robotic helpers of Gru will send even the most hard of hearts into a fit of giggles. Finally, the clever story and the unflagging direction complete the elements for a most successful animated movie. Perhaps, there will be those who object to the abundance of 'cartoon-like' violence and some of the images, such as the appearance of an impaling box. Therefore, parents do be careful about letting very young kids watch the flick. But, all in all, here is another great leap forward in the realm of animation. Don't be despicable in your own family. Reach into your wallet and pony up for tickets for those you love.",9,2,5,21 July 2010
Step Up," A familiar story but a welcome one just the same
","Nora (Jenna Dewan) is an aspiring dancer at the Maryland School for the Arts. She is dismayed when her partner is injured, as it comes just weeks before a recital that is a stepping stone to an offer from a dance company. She needs a new partner to help her rehearse and she starts looking. Tyler, on the other hand, is a teenage foster child in a rough section of Baltimore. Although his foster mother tries hard, his foster father is a no-good loafer who doesn't give the children under his roof the time of day. He just wants a paycheck. One day, Ty and a couple of friends go inside the MSA to retrieve a ball and end up trashing the place. Tyler is sentenced to serve as a janitor at the art school for his community service. Oh, and by the way, Tyler is a talented hip hop dancer. You can probably guess what's coming. Tyler observes beautiful Nora and becomes aware of her dilemma. His solution? Choose me as your dance partner, dear Nora. It happens and it changes both of their lives. This sweet movie, with a rougher undertone, has that ages old story of unlikely and star-crossed lovers. Nora is from a world of privilege and Tyler is from the world of the have-nots. Yet, given a bit of time and effort, they find they need each other and can benefit greatly from the contact. Dewan is very lovely and a terrific dancer while the actor playing Tyler is talented and attractive. The script is a winner and so are the costumes and settings. It would be wonderful if inner city children everywhere could be given a showing of the movie. Tyler's life is truly changed by his exposure to the world outside his neighborhood. Nora, too, gains respect for those less fortunate than herself. Don't hesitate to let teens, or anyone who wants to see the film, get their chance. It is a great character building movie with a special sparkle and beauty.",7,0,1,16 October 2006
Iron Man," Man, this film is the best one I've seen this year....arrange a viewing NOW!
","Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is the head of a large firm that makes devastating weapons of warfare. His father, who founded the company, was responsible for the A-bomb, among other achievements, and he schooled his genius son in the 'fine' art of making killing devices. Now, Stark has rock-star status in the world, for he is also very handsome and rich. On a trip to Afghanistan, with Colonel James Rhodes (Terrence Howard) as a guide, Stark shows the Allied Forces his newest creation. All of a sudden, the company is ambushed and Stark is taken prisoner. Once in captivity, a fellow scientist saves his life by implanting a mechanical device in his heart, for the shrapnel that remains in his body could kill him. Now, the Afghan meanies want Stark to re-create his latest weapons for them and give him any materials he requests, within reason. But, in his new laboratory-cave, Stark instead develops a unique bit of armor that can withstand almost any attack. Naturally, with this metallic suit, he breaks out of his prison and gets rescued, nevertheless leaving bits and pieces of the armor behind. Once back in Malibu, he informs the press that his company won't be making any more weapons. This angers his longtime co-worker, Obadiah (Jeff Bridges) and puzzles his ultra-efficient personal assistant, Pepper Potts (Gywneth Paltrow). In secret, Stark begins to work on a new suit of armor that will far surpass his original work. Thus, he becomes 'Iron Man', a human with the ability to fly and take out the bad guys. Will he save the world? This is an excellent, excellent film, one of the best, if not the BEST, of 2008. First, the cast is terrific. Downey's great manic abilities are slightly in check but he delivers his lines with energy, humor, and compassion. As such, he is one of the most likable comic book heroes ever put up on the screen. Bridges, too, is a marvel, as he totally 'hides' in his role as the supposed friend who crosses over into the dark side. He should most definitely receive an Oscar nomination for his work. As for Paltrow, she is beautiful, intelligent, wry, and touching, nicely balancing the mostly male cast with her strong showing. Howard is one great sidekick and the rest of the cast, although mostly unknowns, are very fine. One must mention that the costumes and sets are wonderful, too. As for the special effects, the script/story, and the direction, they are absolutely mind-blowing and will transfix almost any audience out there. In short, my advice is to go, and go now, to arrange a showing, for this is one of the best 'big-money' movies ever made.",10,2,4,6 August 2008
Blade Runner," The world does not need another review of this extraordinary movie but here goes anyway
","Decker (Harrison Ford) lives in 2019 Los Angeles. He is a mostly retired blade runner, that is, a person who hunts down replicants and eliminates them. Replicants are manufactured human beings that do work on the 'off colonies' of far space that regular human beings have populated, too. Replicants, who are vital in the colonies, are forbidden to come to planet earth. If they do, they are tracked down and killed. Most of them have superior physical powers but lack problem solving and reasoning skills and have few emotions. Although Decker wants to be retired, a particularly lethal group of replicants manages to come to earth and the big boss police chief makes it clear to Decker that he is needed. Or else. Decker begins to hunt down the four replicants on the loose, just as he meets a lady named Rachel, who may be a replicant, too, and a very pretty one. Is there really a world of difference between humans and replicants? What have we really done to ourselves and our civilization by making these 'almost' human beings? This is one of the greatest movies of all time. The story is taken from a work by Philip K. Dick and is superior science fiction. Ford embodies the morally confused but determined blade runner very well. The other actors, especially Rutger Hauer and Sean Young, do fine work, too. However, the style of the film is the movie's greatest asset. The seamy modern world that Ridley Scott and his companions have created is beyond wonderful. From the flying transport machines that bark out advertisements to the people below to the decayed buildings from another era, this is a world one has to see to appreciate. If you have never seen this film, don't walk to the nearest video store or library. Run at top speed and wrestle the film out of someone else's hands, if you have to. This is a piece of celluloid that will be studied for ages to come.",10,1,2,26 October 2006
The Greatest Showman," New, contemporary music for a basically old-fashioned and inspiring film; IT WORKS!
","PT Barnum (Hugh Jackman) , as a poor child, lived near a wealthy mansion, for his father worked at the 'big house'. Unhappily, Phinneas Taylor is left an orphan while his best friend, Charity (Michelle Williams), the daughter of the landowner, is sent away to boarding school. Nevertheless, the two continue to write to each other consistently, for the young love turns into mature love. Bringing himself up by his bootstraps, PT finally convinces Charity's father to give him her hand but no money is bestowed on the couple. Dad thinks Charity will realize her mistake and come running back. NOT SO! PT has dreams of opening a museum of odd things even as the couple has two daughters. The museum soons evolves into a circus, with Tom Thumb, a midget, riding a horse, a bearded lady and other bizarre attractions. Its a big success, even though some of the folks in NYC object to what they call the exploitation of the deformed. Hooking up with a talented promoter, Phillip (Zac Efron) the enterprise becomes even bigger. Making things complicated is Phillips admiration and affection for the principal trapeze artist, Anne (Zendaya), for she is a mixed-race gal in a time when prejudices are front and center. Then, PT gets the notion to put Europe's greatest opera singer, Jenny Lind (Rebecca Fergueson) on a tour of many cities. Will the distance between PT and Charity and the girls bring strain? Ms. Lind, after all, is very beautiful. Then, another tragedy occurs. Can the Greatest Show on Earth continue? This biography of Barnum is an old-fashioned tale of love, endurance, hard-work and gumption. What rare values in today's society! Yet, the very fine music and songs are contemporary, making one doubt whether the two will mesh...they do! Days after I saw it I was still humming the music. Kudos to the composers. Also fine is the cast, with Jackman's handsome face and voice leading the way. Naturally, the period costumes are fabulous while the script and direction keep the tale moving along nicely. Folks, are you looking for a movie in the vein of of classic musicals but with a modern twist? You will find it here!",8,5,11,22 April 2018

Will Bond end up victorious on his first months on the job? This is an exciting movie with the highest of production values. Craig is splendid as the newest Bond, sure to please male and female movie goers alike, with his cool but charming demeanor. The other cast members, including Judy Dench, are very well chosen and significant. As for the scenery, it is, quite simply, to die for. Even if you wish to hide your eyes when the fighting begins, you will love the quick but gorgeous trip around the globe. To everyone's joy, too, the stunts are imaginative and intricate enough to please the longtime Bond fans everywhere.

Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Ole, dear Woody! Not your funniest film but definitely a lightning bolt for the brain!
","Vicki (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) are heading to Barcelona for the summer. Friends since college, Vicki will be working on her master's degree in Spanish culture and Cristina is going along to get over a bad relationship. On one of their first nights in the city, a great-looking artist, Juan (Javier Bardem) suggests that the two ladies accompany him to a remote town in Spain where they can, uh, have a hot threesome and do some sightseeing, too. This suggestion disgusts Vicki as she is engaged to a businessman and has her life pretty well mapped out in her head. Cristina, however, is intrigued and convinces her friend to make the trip but to refrain from any bedroom activity, if she wishes. As luck would have it, Cristina gets ill on that first evening and, unbelievably, Vicki and Juan spend the night together instead. Yet, in the morning, things change. Vicki goes back to Barcelona while Cristina begins a relationship with Juan. Into this already complicated picture comes Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz). She is Juan's mentally unstable ex-wife and, after a suicide attempt, Juan brings her back to his house, where Cristina is also living. Aha! Meanwhile, Vicki's landlady, Judy (Patricia Clarkson) cautions the master's candidate that, sometimes, living for the moment is a good thing. This hits Vicki hard because, in truth, she can't stop thinking about Juan. How will this situation get resolved? Ole, Woody! Although this is not his funniest film (I adore Bullets over Broadway or Curse of the Jade Scorpion), it is definitely one of his most provocative. A menage a trois is a most difficult subject to tackle with sensitivity but, it is presented beautifully here. Also, the film asks some of those age old questions, such as what is more important, a safe, secure, and peaceful existence or a life filled with spur-of-the moment encounters that provide exciting memories? Should one make definite goals in life or give oneself an opportunity for a detour or two? As such, this is one of Allen's best movies. As for the cast, it is marvelous. Hall and Johansson, both lovely actresses, give intelligent, thought-provoking performances, although totally dissimilar. Barden is perfect for his role as the magnetic artist while Cruz, also, does a fine job as the fetching but enigmatic ex-wife. Clarkson, unfortunately, does not have enough screen time, nor does the other players, although they are certainly more than adequate. Naturally, the setting in Barcelona and other Spanish venues is most gorgeous while the costumes are also very well-selected. All of the embellishments that complete a successful film, that is, cinematography, writing and direction are nearly flawless. If you admire Allen's films, do make time to see this newest entry into his peerless catalogue of film-making. Although it is not a gut-buster like Take the Money and Run, its content is like a lightning bolt for the brain. Anyone who views it will have a mountain of matters to ponder for days and weeks after the showing.",8,5,14,16 August 2008
Sweet and Lowdown," Far from lowly, this film is one of Allen's best efforts, with a great cast, story, and music
","Back in the 1920's and 30's, the fictitious Emmet Ray (Sean Penn) was a superlative guitarist, second only to the great Django Reinhardt. His rise to eventual fame, however, was rocky, due to his gigantic ego and eccentricities. Apart from drinking a bit too much and being a no-show at engagements he was committed to play, Emmet also believed in the love 'em and leave 'em philosophy. But, when Emmet felt the world closing in on him, he just headed off to the nearest dump to shoot rats or went to a railroad yard to watch the locomotives. One day, Emmet and a fellow musician court two ladies on a New Jersey boardwalk. After a flip of a coin, Emmet is saddled with Hattie (Samantha Morton) a mute laundress who can nevertheless hear. She soon becomes smitten with Emmet, so much so that even he can't help but bask in her never ceasing attention. After a gig ends, Emmet and Hattie head to Hollywood so Ray can pursue a career in movie soundtracks. But, over time, Emmet decides to dump Hattie, because as an artist, he can't have any permanent commitments. Eventually, a new woman, writer Blanche (Uma Thurman) enters his life and his career endures more ups and downs. But, has Emmet totally forgotten the sweet Hattie? This is a superlative film, with a great cast, story, and music. Woody Allen wrote this gem, of course, and it is very funny and tragic at the same time. Allen appears in the movie himself, as a commentator on the music of Emmet Ray. Penn, known more for his serious work, is a total delight as the self-centered but engaging guitarist. Just watch him try to land on stage from a giant swinging moon and you will laugh yourself silly. Morton, who garnered an Academy award nomination (as did Penn), has no dialogue but is wonderful and expressive as the sweet, faithful woman done wrong. The rest of the cast, including Thurman, Gretchen Mol, Anthony LaPaglia, and others, is fine, too. The look of the film, a re-creation of the twenties and thirties, sports excellent costumes, scenery, and amenities. Finally, the music is lovely, vibrant, and a pure pleasure to hear. If you have never tried an Allen flick, here is one on which to begin your pursuits. It will strum its way into your heart and soul, between huge peals of laughter.",10,1,1,12 June 2008
Saving Mr. Banks," Entertaining story, made all the better by a wonderful cast!
","Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) usually gets what he wants. But, a promise he made to his daughters twenty years ago, to bring the novel Mary Poppins to the screen, has been a big thorn in his side. No matter how he has approached or wooed the author, Brit P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) she has refused to sign over the rights. But, things change. Her money is running out and she does love her beautiful house and amenities. Therefore, this crabby lady finally agrees to come to Los Angeles and meet with Disney himself. When she arrives, she is met by a very personal limo driver (Paul Giamatti) but she shows him no warmth. Nor does the hotel room, filled with Disney stuffed animals, change her attitude. Most of the creatures go in a closet, while Mickey Mouse has to sit in the corner. At the studio, the celebrated composers Richard (Jason Schwartzman) and Robert Sherman are targets of her unpleasantness, as are all of the other staff members. Just why is this dame so contrary, when everyone is rolling out the bright red carpet? In flashback, the viewer learns of her difficult, unstable childhood in Australia. Especially sad is her relationship with her father, Travers Goff (Colin Farrell), who sparked her imagination, when he wasn't drinking and losing jobs. In addition, he dies young and the children are subjected to stuffy Aunt Ellie (Rachel Griffiths). What will it take to please Miss Travers and get her name on the dotted line? For all movie fans who love the terrific Disney classic, Mary Poppins, here is the tale of how it almost never got made! Ms. Travers was one witch-on-wheels whose demands were only exceeded by her horrible disposition. Yes, she had a difficult childhood, which explains but does not excuse her perpetual coldness. Only Emma Thompson could bring her to life with some small saving graces. The rest of the cast, too, is superb, with Hanks, Griffiths, Giamatti, Schwartzman, and company doing a fantastic job. Especially noteworthy is Farrell; never has he been so touching or polished. The sets, from Down Under to sunny California, are also great, as are the costumes, well conceived script and confident direction. The meaning of the title is realized slowly but is memorable. All in all, don't save a showing of this movie for a rainy day. See it before the wind changes indeed.",8,1,4,26 December 2013
Live Free or Die Hard," Forget Spidey and the Giant Bat, if the world is crumbling, let's call John McClane
","John McClane (Bruce Willis) has been attempting a somewhat lower profile as a detective for the New York City police department. His wife has left him and his beautiful daughter, who attends Rutgers, won't even use his last name, preferring Genero. Yet, one day, the Feds ask him to escort a skilled, young computer hacker named Matt (Justin Long) to DC for questioning. McClane bellyaches at this trivial assignment but soon learns that the Feds got it right. As he is ushering Matt out of his apartment in Camden, NJ, all hell breaks loose. A lethal gang of conspirators use some mighty fire power to try and eliminate the duo. But, they don't know McClane, that's for certain. When the world is going down the commode, he's our man. He gets Matt to DC but its not a 'drop off and leave assignment'. Even the Feds don't know what to do when this gang takes over cyberspace in an effort get to their hands on the country's money supply...and more. But, they didn't count on facing McClane. This is a nice bookend to the Die Hard series, for Willis can hardly play this character from a wheelchair, right? From running a car into a helicopter to besting a karate-chopping female terrorist (Maggie Q) McClane is one of the most physical superheroes ever put up on the screen. As such, Willis is great, as he knows how to throw a punch and a punchline at the same time, with ease. The rest of the cast is superlative, too, with Timothy Olyphant just wonderful as the main heavy, and Maggie Q, Kevin Smith, and Justin Long very entertaining. In fact, Long could be the second coming of Keanu Reeves, as his pretty boy looks and throw-away humor are very similar. Naturally, the special effects are top of the line, while the costumes and settings are worthy, too. If you loved the first three films, your wait is over. McClane is back in town and you should see him ASAP. But, even if you just want to sit back and smile while a true American hero kicks behinds at every turn, here is the flick for you.",7,0,1,4 September 2007
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Wow, 3000+ reviews already; But, what the heck, I loved it!
","Thirty or so years after the Rebels got rid of the Emperor, the Dark Forces have risen again. Their new leader, Snoke (Andy Serkin), has a wily, evil assistant, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and a trustworthy General Hux (Domnhall Gleeson).

Naturally, Han, though glad to have his ship back, is reluctant to rejoin the fight against the Dark Side. This is ten times so because Han knows who this Kylo Ren is and its killing him inside. Nevertheless, Han, Chewie, Rey, Finn, BB8, Maz (Lupita Nyong'o) , Poe, General Leia and others team up to defeat Ren, Hux, and their BRAND NEW superweapon powered by the energy of a giant star.

Then, too, the costumes, cool gadgets, sets, effects, script and buoyant direction join forces to make a visual and heartfelt movie. This viewer loved Rey's garb immensely, an elegant scrap of wisp. One word of caution. There are some scenes and happenings which may be hard for the youngest kids to handle. Yet, all in all, join forces with your loved ones and make time for SW VII!",9,4,41,5 February 2016
The Purge," Dark, compelling, not for under 18 and then only with caution
","First, before I begin, let me state that my favorite types of films are art house beauties, like Pride and Prejudice, A Merry War or Cinderella Man. Yet, when I heard the premise of the Purge, I felt compelled to see it, admiring science fiction and dark subjects like mass propaganda and brainwashing. So, here is my review of The Purge.In the very near future, the United States government, under its NEW Founding Fathers, has solved, in its mind, problems of unemployment and crime. It has instituted the Purge, a once a year night of 'soul cleansing', where any crime is allowed. On each March 21, from 7:00 pm to the following morning at 7:00 am, police forces are nowhere to be found and murder, assault, theft, arson, etc. is the norm. No, government officials can not be targeted and weapons above 'level four' are forbidden. Naturally, the rich can afford elaborate security systems on their mansions and endure the purge in their personal fortresses. Everyone else has to fend for themselves. In this way, the population is reduced, riff raff is eliminated, and pent-up rage is released for humanity's 'good'. Or, that's the government line. Top security systems salesman, James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) has become rich from hawking his company's products on members of his elite community. His mansion is the biggest on the block, with a spanking new addition. Wife Mary (Lena Headey) can stay at home and make healthy, scratch meals which are 'carb free' and take care of their two teenagers. Older teen Zoey is bright and pretty but has a boyfriend, Henry, who is already an adult 18 and who James has forbidden her to see. They meet in secret. Younger teen Charlie is also bright but shy and timid. He spends his free time inventing electronic gadgets, like his remote controlled video camera which uses a battered babydoll as its foundation. Now, this year's Purge is to begin. The Sandins go into lockdown after the evening meal, unaware that Henry has hidden himself in the house after visiting Zoey. As each retires to their chosen rooms, with screens showing what is happening outside their immediate area, Charlie sees a man running down the block, screaming for help. The teen makes the decision to momentarily disable the security sys and let the man in. All too soon, this man disappears into an unknown place in the enormous house. What's worse, some rich college age sons and daughters of the Sandin's neighborhood come knocking on the door, too. It seems they, instead of taking shelter in their own homes, went out looking for a victim for their own personal purge. Their choice was the homeless man now confined in the Sandin's home. As their 'preppy killer' leader proclaims, the Sandins must return this man or face their own demise, for they have bought equipment to bring down the security of the Sandin's home. Can this really be? Yes, James tells Mary, despite his company's claims, their system is vulnerable to certain breaches. James begins to hunt for the man, knowing they must throw him to the 'wolves', their killer neighbors. But, before this happens, Henry appears with plans of this own. Also, the perps begin their assault, which they say is their 'right for the night', as they are in need of soul cleansing. How will it all shake down, with most of the neighbors already in resentment of the rich, rich Sandins? If you have ever pondered Shirley Jackson's story of The Lottery or how Hitler, Tojo, and Mussolini were able to use propaganda to convince folks that their plans were for the best, then you have the idea behind the Purge. Nevermind that the actions seem inhuman, unjust, and more, this is the new norm and folks have taken it to heart. This is dark, compelling stuff. All of the actors here do a fine job, including Hawke and Headey, but most of the praise has to go to the premise and its execution. Some critics have dismissed this film as dumb and/or silly but I found it heady stuff. For those who, like me, find the movie's plot description too tantalizing to ignore, then head out to the nearest theater.",7,10,18,19 June 2013
The Replacements," A champion in the realm of sports films! So funny, so honest!
","Jimmy (Gene Hackman) has been offered a less than stellar job. Its the late eighties and the professional football league's players are on strike. It will be Jimmy's job, if he accepts it, to coach a crew of 'scab players' for a team called the Washingon Sentinels. Unconventional anyway, Jimmy signs on, but, only on the promise that he will be given total control from the owner (Jack Warden). It is so. From there, Jimmy starts to assemble a team, which includes a once promising quarterback, Shane (Keanu Reeves), a Welsh kicker (Rhys Ifans), a slow-witted-but-mighty tackle (Jon Favreau) and so on. Jim evens gets a lineman who resembles a sumo wrestler. Naturally, the players are pelted with eggs when there bus arrives at the stadium and doom is predicted. Even the regular cheerleaders honor the strike, so the new leader (Brooke Langton), has to recruit her own squad, picking ladies from the local strip parlor, since no one else can dance. So, it begins. Before long, the Sentinels are doing well, surprising even John Madden and Pat Somerall, who cover the games. Also, Shane has eyes for the head cheerleader but she is a tough sell. However, the lady may protest too much. Then, too, rumors abounds about the return of the official players. How will this rough-and-tumble season go? This adorable film is a champion in the realm of sports films and BEYOND. It is very, very funny, from the cheerleader who can't spell to the footballer (Favreau) who can run folks over but has to have strategies explained numerous times. If you are looking for a demeanor elevator, this one is first rate. Its also very honest in its look at the world of football, romance, and human nature in general. Kudos to all responsible. As for the cast, this is definitely one of Reeves' best movies. He is strikingly handsome, humorous and turns up the heat in the kissing scenes. Whew. Hackman, Warden, Orlando Jones, Langton, Favreau, Ifans and ALL of the others do superior work as well. In fact, they are all too comical for words. Also fine are the costumes, sets (Reeves lives on a houseboat), script and go-for-broke direction. Turn off the daily rerun offerings and replace them with a showing of this great flick. The Replacements is a minor classic.",9,1,3,9 February 2011
Click," It's trite but the movie just does not 'click'
","Michael (Adam Sandler) has a gorgeous wife and the proverbial two kids. He is an architect employed by a tedious boss and Micheal must work extra hours to bring home enough bacon. One day when his own children tease him for mixing up the remote controls, he decides to take action. He will run out and get a universal remote, like the snotty rich neighbors. However, it is rather late at night and the only store open is Bed, Bath, and Beyond. Nevertheless, in the Beyond section of the store, an unusual clerk sells him the ultimate universal remote, one that is free and non-returnable, too. Michael happily returns home. But, wait. Michael soon finds out THIS remote can also stop the dog from barking loudly and fast forward him through a shower or an argument with his wife. Great, is it not? All too soon, Michael learns that the remote has a down side, including missing important moments in his life. And, although he tries, the remote can not be discarded. Help! This is movie that has some funny moments and some good ideas but it's not enough. Sandler has never tried harder to make things work and to keep laughs coming but he ultimately fails. Perhaps this is because of some very tasteless humor when things go awry. Beckingsale is quite wonderful, however, as the much put-upon wife. Walken is always topnotch and it is wonderful to see Winkler and Kavner. With such a cast, one would guess the movie can't miss, but is does. The culprits are probably the so-so script and the uneven direction. In any case, even if you are a Sandler die-hard, you will be left out in the cold by this film. You may even want to click your own remote and fast forward to the end of the film long before the movie's ending.",5,4,9,5 September 2006
The Ugly Truth," You want the truth? You can handle The Ugly Truth, a fine romcom, but be forewarned that it deserves its 'r' rating
","Abby (Katherine Heigl) is an intelligent producer of a local morning show in Sacramento, California. She lives with her cat in a beautiful, lushly-gardened apartment complex but, the lovely lady longs to meet Mr. Right. One day, bad news arrives, twofold. One, since the show's ratings have slipped, the owners of the station have decided to go in a new direction. And, two, that direction would be south, Abby believes, for they have hired a brash, I-don't-mince-words talk show host, Mike (Gerard Butler) for a reprise of his late-night call-in program, The Ugly Truth. Mike will do small segments of advice, where he will counsel women on what a man 'really wants'. Since Abby has a past with this gentleman (she had recently called the late night show to tell Mike to take a hike) the young producer is mighty peeved that he has been hired for 'her' program. Instant dislike reigns supreme. However, Mike does seem to know about affairs of the heart, even in his twisted fashion, and starts to give advice to Abby, on how to 'catch' the very handsome young doctor, Colin (Eric Winter) who has just moved into her complex. two doors down. But, since this requires Abby and Mike to actually converse and confide in one another, could it be that Cupid's arrows could go astray? This is a very raucous and funny romcom but. it is definitely not in the Doris Day tradition. Therefore, if you are easily offended or prefer 'sweet' tales of love, with just a touch of spice, this one may not be for you. That said, the cast is really delightful, for Heigl and Butler make a most attractive. sparring duo and Winter turns heads with his looks and smiles. The supporting cast, with Cheryl Hines and the rest, is quite nice, too. Also, the Sacramento setting is lovely while the costumes are terrific and the production values high. As for the direction, it is full of energy and mischief, as befits a script that is clever but rather risqué. All in all, if you love romcoms or any of the stars, you will probably embrace this one with gusto. For the truth is, it is very romantic at its core, and that's the best ingredient a comedic love tale can possess.",7,79,131,27 July 2009
Her," This 'Her' , moi, liked and admired this movie greatly, so nice to discover a film that tickles the brain
","Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) lives some 30 years in the future. Actually, the world doesn't seem too different, but technology has become even more important. Ted's job is to write love letters for couples or singles who either don't have the time or skills to do a good job. Alas, he has also been in a year of sorrow, after separating from his wife (Rooney Mara). Although true friends tell him constantly there is not hope for a reconciliation, Theodore hasn't given up on the idea. But, he definitely needs a new interest. Voila! There is now an in-home computerized voice 'companion' that can be purchased. Thinking this will help him, Ted plunks down the money and sets up the program. At once, a beautiful female voice, who calls herself Samantha (Scarlett Johannsen) begins to work her charm on soothing Ted's heart and mind. In fact, Theodore becomes so attached to his computer program that he starts to view Sam as a real lady. Uh oh, this can't bode well for the future, can it? Maybe so, as Samantha can suggest various ways for Ted to meed new ladies. Also, a longtime pal (Amy Adams) needs Theodore's help, too. Will Ted become a 'happy guy' again? This intriguing and lovely film has great enchantment for discriminating movie goers. The cast, especially Phoenix, is excellent; what great work Johannsen does with only a voice as well. The script, costumes, and sets are also quite nice. Best of all, the director has chosen to shoot the flick with very interesting angles and montages, an enormous treat for the eyes. This 'Her' here really got a kick out of this film and thinks you will, also.",8,0,2,7 July 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," A cinematic plum, is Slumdog M....you will be overwhelmed by the power and beauty of this tale
","Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) is being beaten, and more, by the Indian police. This is because he has been winning on the Indian game show, Who wants to be a millionaire, and they suspect he is cheating. But, when the chief really begins to listen to Jamal's life story, he starts to realize that the young man has not cheated. From an early age, Jamal has risen out of absolute misery to make it to the final questions on the show. As children, he and his slightly older brother, Salim, had to run and hide from the police, if they were caught playing in the wrong city place. Their mutual love for a minor film star provided Jamal with the ability to correctly identify one of M's beginning questions. Then, they lost their mother, brutally, to an ethnic cleansing but the apparel of the attackers aided Jamal in answering another of the show's queries. And, so it continued, throughout the brothers survival in life, from their time as members of a beggars group, run by unbelievably cruel Hindi-Fagins, to their pickup jobs near the Taj Mahal, etc. The brothers were joined by a beautiful girl orphan, Latika, for a time but Salim took her away from Jamal, for a spell. But, Jamal's life journey has, miraculously, provided him with the responses he needs to 'win' a million. Will he, ultimately, succeed, or will he go away with nothing? This is a brief, sketchy report on a plum of a film. Slumdog is ingenious and brilliant and touching, in the extreme. To see this unbelievable tale of the triumph of the human spirit, under extremely challenging circumstances, is the ultimate in the 'feeling great' category of cinematic experience. As Jamal, Patel excels in his role as the most under of 'underdogs' who, nevertheless, rises to amazing heights. All of the other cast members are likewise terrific, from the woman playing Latika, to the television host, and, especially, to the gentleman taking on the very difficult role of Salim. Needless to say, the scenery is a mixture of the sights of India's great beauty and its abject, abysmal poverty. Production values for the film are also great, while the story and direction are flawlessly well-conceived and executed. In summary, do not delay in making time for Slumdog M. It is a perfect plum of a film and everyone will feel like a 'million bucks' when it reaches its triumphant conclusion.",10,1,3,18 January 2009
Me Before You," Sweet, sorrowful film, beautifully presented; some viewers will not feel comfortable with the ethical issues
","In the South of Britain, near Wales, a young businessman, Will (Sam Claflin) has just kissed his girlfriend goodbye on a rainy morning. He tries to hail a taxi but, unhappily, he is struck by a motorcycle. Meanwhile, Louisa Clark (Emilia Clarke) has been a waitress in a nearby café for six years, where she proved to be a friendly asset. Unexpectedly, she is given a pink slip and a month's wages. At home, the Clarks hear this news with dismay, for Papa Clark has been laid off and Lou's salary has been supporting them all. Undaunted, the fetching, zany-dressed young gal goes to the job center for new leads. There's one promising one. It seems a mother, Camilla (Janet McTeer) is searching for a nurse's aide to help her paralyzed son. Yes, its Will, from the movie's beginning, who is now confined to a wheelchair with little motion below his neck. Will's family, the Trainers, are the richest folk in the area and live in a modified castle. In short order, Louisa gets the position, for she is chatty and gregarious, despite her lack of nursing experience. But, wait, Will greets his new caretaker with undisguised rudeness, asking her to 'not talk' to him and stay out of his way as much as possible. A roving nurse, Nathan, though, tells Louisa he is delighted she is there and assures her that Will is rude because his situation is so bleak. In time, things change. Will does become more communicative and is cheered by Lou's weird clothes and infectious manner. When his former girlfriend comes to break the news that she is engaged to a man who was once W's best friend, Louisa is there to help Will from falling to pieces. In fact, Lou and the nurse decide to put forth a list of outings which will, hopefully, change his view toward life. This involves going to the horse races and a symphony concert. Indeed, Will does seem cheerier. But, oh no, Lou overhears Will state he agreed to give himself six months of living for his mother's sake, at which end he hopes to go a euthanasia clinic in Switzerland. Can this really be, when Lou has started to love Will and he seems to being feeling the same way about her? This sweet, sorrowful movie will have its viewers in waterfalls of tears. Yes, there are moments of humor and fun, but, the tale is always a story of a wheelchair bound man, formerly very active. who struggles to accept his new reality. The cast is great, with Claflin, Clarke, McTeer, Charles Dance, and all of the others doing fine work. Mr. Claflin, who also appeared in Love, Rosie, will hopefully not be confined to roles in love stories, although his handsome face is swoon worthy. Then, the setting is superb, a lovely glimpse at a little known part of Britain. Louisa's costumes are 'sublimely ridiculous' amid a well clad cast and the script, from a novel by JoJo Moyes, is carefully, poignantly written. Finally, the direction is somewhat slow, at times, but hits all the right marks for its presentation. As stated above, some viewers will not like the film's stance on euthanasia, as it strongly supports personal choice. Therefore, listen to this caution. However, most viewers, especially fans of romantic drama, will welcome the opportunity for a sweet, sad cry.",7,4,5,11 June 2016
The Great Gatsby," A noteworthy film, has a great design and cast but the second half lacks the energy of the first
","In the Roaring Twenties, Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), a Yale graduate and a Midwesterner, decides to move to New York City and learn the bond business. Not being a man of enormous means, despite springing from a fine family, he considers himself lucky to rent a cottage on the West Egg of Long Island. His second cousin, Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) and her extremely wealthy husband, Tom (Joel Edgerton) live across the bay on the more fashionable East Egg. Almost at once, Nick discovers that in the gargantuan mansion that is next door to his little abode, is a mysterious gentleman, Mr. Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio). In fact, Nick hears the enormous summer parties from his windows before he actually meets the man himself. When Mr. Carroway has lunch with the Buchanans, a fellow meal guest, Jordan Baker, is intrigued by Nick's residence and tells him she went to one of Mr. Gatsby's parties. Daisy, oddly, perks up her ears at the name as well. But, before Nick receives his invitation to the next affair, other happenings occur. It is revealed that Tom has a mistress in the Land of Ashes, an industrial area that separates the Eggs from Manhattan. Her name is Myrtle Wilson(Isla Fisher) and she steals away one afternoon to party with Tom, Nick and assorted others in the cheap apartment Tom rents for her downtown. Garage owner Mr. Wilson, the husband, is too trusting and work weary to figure out the schemes. But, back on WE, Nick accepts his neighbor's hospitality and is floored by the party's opulence, both in scale and entertainment. The bondsman turns around and runs smack into Gatsby. They hit it off, with the tycoon revealing some of his background to Nick. All is for a purpose is Gatsby's mind, for he once knew Daisy, as a former suitor, and he wants Nick to invite his cousin to 'tea' so they can meet again. In Gatsby's heart, the romance has never died but the war and Jay's former poverty came between them. Nick agrees to the rendez-vous. Once the former lovers meet, however, they ignite a chain of events that end in tragedy. Beyond that, just what is the secret behind Mr. Gatsby's enormous moneybags? Most folks who read this review will probably know the book and will have sought out other takes on Baz Luhrman's new film. This critic believes it to be a fine film and an innovative production but, alas, not without a flaw. More of that soon. First, the production itself is so bursting with style, gorgeous art direction, vibrant music, and glittering costumes that it is a pleasure to behold. Second, the cast is terrific, with DiCaptrio fulfilling the title character with a wonderful performance. Mulligan, Maguire, Fisher, Edgerton, and all of the others offer great support. Then, too, the script is most faithful to the original work, with once major exception, but it spouts Fitzgerald's own words most of the time, a big asset for purists. Especially true are F. Scott's subtle depiction of wealth, family heritage, and the dreams of those who, lacking both, want to get there. The only flaw, my view, is that the plentiful energy of the first half vanishes in the second, as the pace gets slower and slower. As a result, the film runs a bit too long and lacks the finishing impact it should have. Nevertheless, this spanking new interpretation of the 'Great American Novel' has riches to behold and enjoy.",Null,0,2,11 May 2013
The Proposal," Propose an outing to your pals to see this winning film, romance lovers!!
","Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is a domineering, witchy head book editor for Colden Books. When she arrives at the office, fellow workers send alerts on their computers to colleagues, telling them that they better look busy when she passes by. Her long-suffering assistant, Drew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) brings two coffees to work each day, of her same favorite flavor, in case one of them spills en route. She steps all over him and he detests her, naturally. But, why does he endure Margaret's attitudes? Because, one, he wants to be a major editor himself and, two, he is an aspiring writer with hopes of having his work published. One day, a serious problem arrives.

This will mean a loss of job and home, as she can not even work for an American company, from a home computer in Toronto. What to do? Suddenly, Margaret has a plan. She proposes to the unattached Drew, begging him to marry her in name only, until her immigration problem is solved. Then, they can quietly divorce. Drew is horrified but soon realizes he can make some career demands in return. But, the United States authorities are immediately wary that the couple is in love. So, the two head to Drew's hometown of Sitka, Alaska, to announce their engagement at his grandmother Annie's (Betty White) 90th birthday party. They can also get to know one another, for they will have to answer detailed questions about the other's habits soon. Drew's mother, Grace (Mary Steenburgen) is thrilled at the idea of a wedding and insists they marry here and now. Father Joe (Craig T. Nelson) is less enthusiastic and Drew's former flame, Gertrude (Malin Ackerman) comes calling to confuse things as well. And, wait, could it be that Margaret and Drew might actually get along? Romance lovers, take heart, for here is fine flick to satisfy your strongest romcom cravings. First, the actors are great, with Bullock a delight as the unpleasant Margaret and Reynolds just great as the suitor-impostor. (My advice to Reynolds, however, is to make his next film anything BUT a romcom, as we don't want him getting into a rut after Just Friends, Definitely Maybe and now, this one. He's too talented to box himself in.) The supporting cast is also very fine, with White eliciting big laughs. Ackerman, despite being very pleasant, is mostly wasted, however. The setting in Alaska is also a huge asset, as it is overwhelming lovely, making one want to book a cruise right NOW. Costumes and other film amenities are great, too. As for the story, script and direction, they are energetic and amusing, even with some familiar elements. In short, propose a cinematic outing to your closest friends and family, romance lovers. Everyone will say YES to The Proposal when asked about its satisfaction levels.",8,4,16,22 June 2009
Sully," Excellent, harrowing film about a true American hero
","Sully Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) has been flying since he was a teenage crop duster. Now after a gazillion flights, he takes the controls again with his co-pilot, Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) on a cold January day. But, alas, almost immediately after takeoff, a flock of geese fly into the engines, disabling both of them. As experienced pilots, both know how far a plane can fly to land. The air traffic controller offers a return to LaGuardia and a nearby Jersey airport. But, within a few seconds, Sully deems these choices impossible. The glorious Hudson river stretches out in front of them and Sully makes a MIRACULOUS landing in the water. Then, at once, the plane is taking water and the 155 passengers have to be rushed to the inflatable lifeboats and wait to be rescued by the Coast Guard. They are, all of them. Yet, Sully and Skiles must spend a few days in New York while the NSA begins to question their judgments on landing in the water. While Sully is a hero to the passengers, crew, and the whole world, the NSA bigwigs try to tell him he should have headed for the airports. Simulations show they could have made it. Aghast, Sully and Jeff counter that it was impossible. Further tests are ordered while Sully's wife (Laura Linney) is waiting for him, anxious and afraid his career will be over. Will it? This fine, 90 minute film is exciting and maddening. Hanks gives a great performance, making you forget everything but that he is Sully. Eckhart, Linney, and all of the others support him wonderfully. When Eastwood recreates the water landing, it is terrifying and amazing. But, how annoying it is that the NSA is slow to thank this great pilot and quick to doubt his abilities and decisions. Its probably routine but it sure doesn't seem like it. Audiences will like the NYC setting with lots of great views from the air, too. Inventive, also, is the director's choice to unfold the film, not chronologically, but in jumps between past and present. All in all, this is another masterful film by Ms. Clint Eastwood. See it, see it!",8,0,2,28 September 2016
Jurassic Park," After all these years, this is still an exciting, amazing, thought-provoking film; park yourself soon in front of a screen!
","Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill). a paleontologist, and his assistant-girlfriend, Dr. Ellie (Laura Dern), a paleo-botanist, are digging for dinosaurs in Montana. Although they live quite rustically in a small trailer, they are avid for finding the remains of the large, long-lost reptiles and their food sources. Funded by a wealthy businessman, John Hammond (Sir Richard Attenborough), they are startled to find him at their doorstop one fine day. As Hammond tells it, he needs their help. He has opened a theme park, on an island off the coast of Costa Rica, one that is devoted to dinosaurs. Could these two top-notch scientists come and analyze the place? He, Hammond, would fund their work in America for three more years. They agree and off they go. Joining them as well is Mr. Hammond's lawyer and another scientist, chaos theory master, Dr. Ian (Jeff Goldblum). What the party does not realize is that, using dinosaur DNA found in amber-sap fossils, Hammond has actual dinosaurs grazing on the island! He has stegos, brachios, and, unbelievably, intensely guarded T-rexes and velociraptors! The scientists can't believe what they see. However, as Dr. Ian points out, powerful animals of this nature can not be controlled, for something will always go wrong. Indeed it does. Soon after arriving, the party, which includes Hammond's own two grandchildren, takes a trolley ride tour, one that future visitors will take. But, the scummy computer programmer (Wayne Knight), miffed at his paycheck, steals the dino DNA and runs away, putting the computers in the lurch. Naturally, they break down and the electric fences that guard the fierce creatures quit functioning! Left out in the forests with these monsters, who will stay alive? This is a monumentally great film, in all categories. It has a marvelous cast, a sensational story, intense action sequences, and dazzling philosophical propositions. The computer-generated dinosaurs are utterly amazing and very, very scary. Breathing naturally during a view will be impossible. One of the last scenes, where the T-Rex stands up in full glory while the park sign noting 'dinosaurs ruled the world' falls to the ground is eye-popping. If you have never seen it, don't delay! Even if you are indifferent to science fiction, action films, or any other genres, this is one film NOT TO BE MISSED! So, grab the DVD and park yourself on the couch for the ride of your life, movie style.",10,2,3,21 January 2010
The Soloist," Don't go to this one solo, you'll need someone's hand to hold, as this is an extremely moving tale with tremendous turns by Foxx and Downey, Jr.
","Steve Lopez (Robert Donwey, Jr.) is an ace writer for the Los Angeles Times. One day, as he is bicycling in the area, he falls harshly from his bike and ends up in the hospital. Despite a banged-up face, however, he's fine. Not long after, Steve observes a homeless man, Nathaniel (Jamie Foxx) playing a beautiful tune on a two-string violin. Striking up a conversation, Steve soon learns that Nathaniel once went to the prestigious Juilliard School of Music and studied the cello! How is it that the musician is on the streets? Actually, that's very apparent, for Nathaniel is obviously mentally challenged and most likely schizophrenic. Sensing a great column, Steve makes Nathaniel the subject of a future piece. After reading it, an area lady sends Nathaniel, via Steve's office, the cello she can no longer play, due to arthritis. But, Steve knows that it will be stolen if Nathaniel has it in his makeshift home so he makes a bargain with the musician. An area shelter will keep the instrument for him to play on the premises and maybe Nathaniel can consider living there, too? It works, at least for Nathaniel coming to practice the cello. Yet, as Steve gets further connected to Nathaniel as a human being, will he truly be able to make a difference in his life? Don't go to this one solo, my friends, as the tale is so moving and heart-wrenching that you will need a hand to hold. It tackles the subjects of homelessness, mental illness, poverty, music, and charity straightforward, with no sugar coating. As the two main characters, Downey, Jr. and especially Foxx are no less than brilliant and should garner some sort of nominations, if the academies have any sense. Catherine Keener, Tom Hollander, and all of the other cast members are marvelous, too. The setting in Los Angeles is a mixture of the good, the bad, and the ugly and the costuming is wonderful, especially Foxx's unusual clothing items. All other production values are high as well. In brief, if you are a regular cinema attendee or rent/buy works for a home viewing, don't skip this one. It is a richly rewarding and supremely heartfelt film.",9,0,1,1 July 2009
Up in the Air," Few movie fans will be 'up in the air' about this one, its a truly great film
","Ryan (George Clooney) is an ace at what he does. He works for a company, under boss Craig (Jason Bateman), which sends him all over the country to corporations who are downsizing. Its Ryan's job to give those being 'axed' the bad news. As distasteful as this might seem, Ryan does it with care and consideration, giving the newly fired advice on how to overcome this temporary setback. But, what Ryan loves MOST about his job is that he gets to travel everywhere and is never in one place very long. Unmarried and disliking commitments and family ties, he is rarely at his tiny apartment in Omaha. One day, however, a sort of reckoning occurs. The new business hotshot at Ryan's firm, Natalie (Anna Kendrick) has convinced Craig that video conferencing is the best way to go. No more flying here and there and wasting money. They can do their 'dirty work' from their headquarters in Omaha. Ryan is upset, to say the least. He makes some sharp observations about why it won't work and he insists that Craig let him take the biz whiz on some trips to get a clearer picture of the operations. Craig agrees. Meanwhile, Ryan has met a fellow frequent flyer businesswoman, Alex (Vera Farmiga) in a hotel lobby and they are starting to 'arrange' their schedules to meet time and again. Is this the beginning of something? Not likely. As Ryan and Natalie travel to Wichita, Detroit and many other places, Natalie does learn what a difficult job it is to let someone go gracefully, even in person. She also flounders when HER perfect boyfriend calls it quits. Will the video-termination idea fall apart permanently? This is a great film, tackling many difficult issues with courage. For example, what is most important in life, our work or our family connections? Don't laugh, for our jobs sustain our families, making it difficult for everyone when positions are lost. Also, should we open our hearts, only to have them broken? As the players in this drama, the cast is truly great. Clooney is terrific as the flying 'loner', who isn't happy with the changes to his present life. At critical times, his marvelous facial expressions say it all. Farmiga, Kendrick, and Bateman also do superb work, as do the lesser cast members. Costumes, sets, and cinematography are very fine. Especially noteworthy are the aerial views of cities just as Ryan's plane is landing. But, it is the script and rock-solid direction of Jason Reitman that take top honors. Here is a story with so much substance that it belies the feeling of 'air'. Therefore, if you never want to miss the 'heavyweights' of American film, race over to the nearest cinema and buy a ticket for this one. It is a classic stand-out in the cinematic world.",9,1,3,13 January 2010
Atonement," Amazing, Astonishing, Alluring......Atonement is an artistic triumph of the highest degree
","Briony (Saoirse Ronan), a precocious thirteen year old, and young adult Cecelia (Keira Knightley) are the daughters of a wealthy, landowning family of Britain. An aspiring writer, Briony is highly observant of any and all activity surrounding her small world. One day, she happens upon her sister, not once, but twice, in a romantic encounter with Robbie (James McAvoy). Robbie is the son of a household staff member (Brenda Blethyn) and has worked on the gardens of the estate but he has also been educated by the family's patriarch. He is an intelligent and handsome man, with a good heart. However, Briony also has a crush on Robbie and her jealousy sets off a tragic state of affairs. When two young male cousins of the girls, dropped off at the mansion by divorcing parents, decide to 'run away', the entire household searches for them in the dark of night. When Briony, flashlight in hand, stumbles across a man assaulting the young cousins' sister, she decides to tell the police that Robbie is the rapist. It is categorically untrue but, alas, Robbie is sent to jail. Five years later, Robbie is let out of prison to become a soldier for Britian in World War I and Cecelia, too, runs away from her family to work as a military nurse. The couple, still greatly in love, meet briefly but make plans to be together forever, when the war is over. Briony, too, enlists as a nurse and tries to contact her sister to ask for forgiveness and to make amends. But, can anything atone for the ruination of two lives? This is a movie of astonishing, tragic beauty. The principal actors, Knightley, Ronan, Blethyn, McAvoy, Vanessa Redgrave, and others are all superlative, giving it their all as the doomed, complex characters. Equally beautiful are the costumes, the settings, and the cinematography, for it would hard to find a more breathtakingly sumptuous film. Yet, even then, it is the story and the direction that should receive the most applause. This is a tale of woe on an epic scale, very intricate and very unsettling. More importantly, the direction is amazing, with happenings often told twice, from different perspectives, with seamless and subtle integration. The result is a work of art of the highest degree, deserving of infinite praise. In short, do not miss Atonement. It can send any serious film viewer into a rapturous state of mind.",10,5,8,9 January 2008
V for Vendetta," A for Amazing, B for Brilliant, C for Cerebral, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera
","V (Hugo Weaving) lives in a dystopian British society of the near future. Terribly disfigured, he wears a Guy Fawkes mask at all times. Wronged long ago by a government agency, he is plotting his revenge. Evidentally, the United States is in chaos, having been a victim of nuclear warfare and plague.

However, soon Evey is captured and undergoes torture to induce her to reveal V's residence. Will she break? Will V's brave efforts be for naught? How can I describe such a sensational movie as this? Yes, its quite violent in parts and owes a debt of gratitude to Orwell's 1984, The Count of Monte Cristo and other sources. Once a graphic novel, it also grapples with huge moral issues, such as to overthrow a corrupt nation, does the fighter become corrupt as well? Portman, complete with a British accent, is beautiful and touching while Weaving, with only a voice, does an incredible job as the title character. Hurt, too, is amazing, while Rea, Pigott-Smith, and all, all of the other cast members are admirable indeed. Then, too, the look of the film is breathtaking while the script and direction are brilliant to the end. In short, D for Don't MISS it, run now, buy it for your collection and put it on the shelf reserved for truly great movies.",10,3,7,1 March 2012
