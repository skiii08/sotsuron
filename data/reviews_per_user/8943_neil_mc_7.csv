Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Ties everything up very slickly
","Although most people seem to rate Volume 2 as the lesser film, there is no way QT could have come out with a blood-splattered, ultra-violent exact replica of Volume 1 - what would have been the point? Instead what we get is a more thoughtful film, albeit with the odd eyeball-plucking here and there.SPOILERSThe body count in Volume 2 drops substantially from the first (from 41 down to 3) which is a very welcome addition really - there's just no need for a repeat of the Crazy 88 scene at all. What we DO get however are some top-notch action scenes with, dare I say it, a little more class - the eye plucking being a particular highlight, the Black Mamba biting and the subsequent speech by Elle also a standout, along with The Bride being buried alive - admittedly done quite a few times before in other films, but what hasn't in a QT film?A few points to consider - just where did the Black Mamba go in the 15 minute interlude between biting Budd and showing up near the end of that scene?, why make the subtitles almost unreadable? (copying off other films with yellow text, I presume), and just what purpose did the Mexican pimp and his messed up prostitute serve to the film?But showing 'Shogun Assassin' to a 4-year-old, and killing her father in the back garden only 20 metres from her bedroom, certainly qualifies as dark humour in my book. Top stuff.I'm sure there are a few people out there who do prefer Volume 2 to Volume 1 - me included.",Null,0,1,4 September 2004
Empire of the Sun," Where are the Oscars?
","Not so much for the film (although it was brilliant!) but for the acting performance of Christian Bale. He managed to single-handedly carry this massive Spielberg film on his small shoulders from start to finish. I see he won a couple of Young Artists Awards, but this display of acting is surely competition for the cream of 1987 - incidentally the Best Actor Oscar for '87 was won by Michael Douglas for 'Wall Street'. Christian Bale, I feel, deserved to be considered - aged 13 or not!",Null,1,4,26 July 2003
The Patriot," It makes you proud to be English
","Maybe the American makers of this film thought that nobody outside of the US would give a monkey's toss about the American Independence - and they'd be right - but it somehow managed to make it to other countries anyway, including that little EVIL place called Britain.Mel Gibson continues his crusade to devour anything and everything to do with the British Empire and takes it upon himself - literally by himself by the way - to gain America's independence. If you're expecting great action sequences here, be warned that they are all in slow-mo with Gibson charging around the battlefield like an idiot, looking all brave and stuff. At one point he even stabs the BAD English colonel's horse with the American flag - I kid you not!More evidence, as if it were needed, as to how pathetic this film actually is, comes with the casting of pretty boy Keith Sledger in the 'heroic' role of Gibson's son - easily the single most annoying character ever to grace a war film.One saving grace is Jason Isaacs - brilliant in his role.Terrible film, of which there is no justification. 0/10",Null,5,10,21 September 2004
Tigerland," A War Theme Park
","SPOILERSColin Farrell is awesome in this film, there are no other words, and in my opinion he pulls off one of the best soldier performances of any war film. And that's all I have to say about that!As for the film itself, the conflicts between the troops are played out very well, with the tension of 'Tigerland' quite often (or very often) leading to fist fights (the effect of which is helped by the involving, documentary-style camerawork), with some men desperate to find a way, any way, to get themselves off the programme.Although the film threatens to go haywire close to the end with Wilson's lone loony crusade, it is saved by some astute direction from a certain Joel Schumacher (this being, along with 'Falling Down', his best film to date) and a superb closing voice-over leaving the ending very much open. A very, very well-made film. 8/10",Null,1,1,30 August 2004
The Piano," Not the most cheery of tales
","MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSFirstly I have to say that I'm bemused as to how Holly Hunter received an Oscar for this. She doesn't have any dialogue, therefore you would expect her to at least show off a facial expression or two. But no - she doesn't even have any of those in her locker, and instead maintains the same utterly depressing face throughout the entire two hours. To be honest, the whole story nearly bored me to death. To have the main character in the film as a mute isn't the best start, but we are not even offered any thoughts as to her predicament through the use of voice-over. Only at the beginning and end does her 'mind speak' and in all honesty I expected a lot more of this, particularly with the torment she suffers. Because of this, I couldn't sympathise with her at all as she was as distant to me as she was to the characters.It seems ambiguous as to why she is mute in the first place - the obvious and most intriguing explanation being that she is seeking attention. Indeed she decides at the end of the film that she wants to speak now, as the idea of mutism is simply brushed aside.The most discouraging aspect about this film on the whole is that nothing much happened. The pacing is extremely slow and laboured and in the end there isn't much to take from it. I'm still not sure how it received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture - very strange.",5,5,11,6 May 2003
The Terminal," An airport story
","Steven Spielberg tells the tale of an Eastern European man who gets stuck at JFK due to a series of unfortunate circumstances. The premise of the film is a good one, the injection of 'comedy' into the proceedings, however, isn't. Not much in the way of laughs here unfortunately, I only recall 'we don't play for money, we play for unclaimed items from the lost and found' making any sort of impression on me - oh, and not forgetting the discovery of why flight attendants are always smiling.Tom Hanks is the man with the unenviable task of pulling off a Krakozian accent  and in the end seemingly turns to Sacha Baron Cohen's Borat for help, 'As we say in Kazhakstan...'  but his isolated character does bring back good memories of his 'Castaway' turn.SPOILERSA few interesting points to notice: how Victor arrives in the US with only 'Yes' and 'No' to his English vocabulary, yet only days later is near fluent after purchasing a handbook from an airport shop and watching a news report. Plus, it was too long  the subplot with the Indian man is unnecessary and him stepping in front of a Boeing at the end is ridiculous in the extreme. Also, Catherine Zeta-Jones is totally wasted  either that, or the romance was just thrown in as a Spielberg 'crowd pleaser' and then abandoned mid-point because of the complete lack of credibility.And the token sappy Spielberg ending doesn't disappoint either. Apart from the Indian on the runway, we also get half of the airport following Hanks down an escalator (why? - not everybody in the airport is gonna know, or care, about the guy), and then to top it off we get a member of airport security going against orders and actually giving Hanks his jacket. Then we get snow. Terrible ending.",Null,0,2,3 September 2004
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," What a partnership!
","This film is an absolute delight to watch. Not only does it have the action and near death experiences of the first two, it also has Sean Connery and the inevitable humour he brings with him. To team him up with Harrison Ford is an absolute masterstroke, as the one-liners keep on coming and are delivered to devastating effect, giving the film a much needed lighter tone after it's predecessor The Temple Of Doom. The father-son relationship has a good chemistry and is played brilliantly by the two leads.Another reason for the films greatness is the lack of a 'Bond Girl' spoiling the mood. The annoying female sidekick role is deemed unnecessary here and avoided at all costs following the failed attempts of the first two films.Overall, this film comes at just the right time in the trilogy, leaving you wanting more - I just hope Connery returns for the imminent 4th installment!I rated Raiders Of The Lost Ark and Temple Of Doom at 7 and 6 but I give The Last Crusade an 8.",8,1,2,27 May 2003
