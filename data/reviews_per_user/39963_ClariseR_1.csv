Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," At long last, the wonderful magic of Lucas' imagination was brought to the screen
","Once the hype began in summer '97, I feared for Lucas. I knew that it would be tremendous pressure for a director to come out of a 15 year hiatus and produce a movie that could match the pure joy we received from watching the blessed trilogy. Epsiode One was a gift from Lucas, an explanation of some things and an opening of door for more possibilities. He led us back to a time when things were becoming chaotic in the Republic and he gave us new characters to fear and love. All in all the movie left me with a great excitement and feeling that this is just the beginning.",9,0,0,24 May 1999
