It," Terriable Movie -MOST READ-
","This movie is clearly sexist, racist and terrible. It's sending my children the wrong messages about clowns, black people and genders. It's wring to call the clown 'IT' when we can clearly tell it's a male. Secondly, I don't want my kids to think clowns are killers. Clowns are suppose to give joy to kids, not molest and kill them. I payed $210.99 for a clown to come to my son's birthday party in two weeks, but now he is scared for his life. Lastly, this movie makes my kids thing black people are treated like non Homo sapiens who get treated like animals. This movie shouldn't been seen to children, let alone anyone. Thank you for reviewing my review.",1,6,23,16 September 2017
