The Incredible Hulk," An enjoyable watch, but there are too many inconsistencies
","In preparation for Avengers: Endgame, I watched The Incredible Hulk. Due to the fact that I've heard and read an unbelievable amount of hate towards this film (and I had been putting off watching this movie for a long time), I was pleasantly surprised. It is certainly the black sheep of the MCU.The Good:
The story was certainly interesting and gauged my interest.
I also really like the opening sequence of the film. The theme used during this was astoundingly spine-chilling, which instantly set up a dark mood compared to other MCU entries. The lighting only furthered the sombre atmosphere.
I really liked Edward Norton's troubled portrayal of Bruce Banner; it was a shame that he was replaced by Mark Ruffalo (although I thoroughly enjoy Mark's portrayal of Bruce and the Hulk.
William Hurt shines in every scene as General Ross.
I quite like the subtle details of the relationship between Betty and Bruce.
The action sequence in the second act was outstanding.
The post-credits scene is a marvel. Watch it.The Bad:
The amount of inconsistencies throughout this film was very, very distracting to me. A gigantic example of this is when Bruce Banner somehow makes it from Rio de Janeiro to Guatemala in one single day. I used Google Maps to measure the distance: it came to over 6500 kilometres. The Hulk changed back into Banner somewhere along the way, but Banner could not have trekked through the Amazon and through the DariÃ©n Gap in one day, even as the Hulk. Another inconsistency is when Banner goes to a woman to buy some trousers, she speaks Portuguese instead of Spanish. There are many more littered among the story. It seems as if the story just goes to where it needs to go, without actually logically thinking about how and why?
Due to the aforementioned point, the pacing was very erratic, which distracted me from what was actually happening.
Some character motivations and decisions were questionable. Bruce is very aware of what his blood can do if it is exposed, but he sends a blood sample to 'Mr. Blue' from Rio all the way to NYC in a parcel, which will be tossed around and abused during its transit, which could put so many people handling the package at risk.
Emil Blonsky was a terrible villain. Abomination was terrible. The fight scene in the third act was not thrilling at all. He should have killed him, as it would be something that the Hulk would do, fuelled by rage as he nearly killed his love.
They should have killed Betty off during that scene, as it would give Hulk even more motivation to kill Abomination. (I sincerely doubt that Betty will return in Endgame, so this would have been perfect).Overall Verdict:
I didn't respond to this film in the way that Betty does when she gets out of the taxi driven by the crazy, road-rage guy. I wouldn't say it's essential to watch in order to understand the MCU (as the first Avengers movie successfully re-introduces you to Hulk), but if you have some time and you want to watch a movie that doesn't require your full attention, this suits the situation.
Therefore, I have given this a 5/10 star rating, as it has some major flaws
which drew me away from the film. However, there were some positive aspects, which saved it from going down in my books as a disaster.",5,0,2,24 April 2019
