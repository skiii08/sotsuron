Black Swan," IMDb TOP #73 ... really?
","I finally got to watch 'The black swan' after hearing good comments about it for months. Once it ended, I came to IMDb to see if I was the only person in the planet who didn't like the movie. Well, it was a relief to see I wasn't alone. But it startled me that this movie is now 73 in the top 250 movies at IMDb! Well, this movie left me cold. Two hours passed watching a cliché ridden story about a crazy ballerina who somehow managed to get the role of Odette/Odille in Swan Lake at a presumably large American Ballet Company. I guess a ballerina slowly going crazy or destroying her personal life in search of perfection in her art is not a bad idea (watch the Red Shoes), but this is not the case of the movie. If I can define this movie, I would pick the lack of one thing: SUBTETLY. Oh well, I would also add CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. Two things completely absent in the movie. Everything over here is told/narrated/musicalized/filmed in the worst in your-face way. It's so clear that the girl is crazy from the very beginning that what's the point on going on with her hallucinations? We know perfectly that what we are seeing is her deranged mind. No surprises, no turns here. The end is completely predictable though is utterly unbelievable. The acting? I haven't been impressed by Natalie Portman in other movies and this was no exception. I had seen enough lived and recorded ballet to have an idea how a prima ballerina looks and moves. Though Miss Portman underwent a difficult training for several months, it doesn't replace the years of hard training of a true dancer. If the effort on training your body is the best resource you have as an actor to pull the part, instead of facial expression and a thorough investigation of what being a dancer means, then Miss Portman deserves her Oscar. I personally prefer actors that may not be so fit physically but can communicate with their audiences with their eyes, facial expressions or language. I only saw a blank faced one expression Portman through the movie and a few shots of her arms trying to mimic a ballerina's moves. Mr. Cassel fares better with the little he was given to. Winona Ryder is properly over the top as the former prima ballerina dumped by Cassel. Ms. Kunis at least looks sexy and sympathetic in her brief role. Direction and cinematography: I know is hip and artsy to film as a 10 years old with an old camcorder, but don't you have the feeling that this is just becoming a tired way of trying very hard to be original when using such an old story thread as the one used here? I'll watch now The Red Shoes for a movie about ballet. And then I'll watch Psicosis for a thriller. And I'm sure I'll forget 'The black swan' in a couple of days. It wasn't even interesting enough as to enter in my list of movies that other people love and that I love to hate.",1,9,17,22 April 2011
Romeo + Juliet," Ruined by lousy acting
","I hadn't seen this movie in years. I remember actually liking it when it first came up. Should I mentioned I didn't speak English at that time? Seeing it again this time I realized how horrible pretty boy Leonardo di Caprio and Claire Daines sound. Their pronunciation is lousy and they just don't have any sense of enunciation. Just watch Di Caprio's scenes with Pete Postlethwaite's Laurence: day & night. The movie is so well intentioned, the updating ideas are good, the production design excellent; even the frantic editing and the pop music fit this modern adaptation. But everything fails if your two main characters are played by modest actors who can't follow the archaic yet beautiful language of the great bard.A pity.",4,0,0,21 August 2012
Inception," Talk about overrated movies
","Surely IMDb can survive without yet another amateur review for 'Inception'. I'm only doing this to justify myself about the 2 star rating. I would normally have rated this movie with 6 points. But as other reviewers state, I feel that is just fair to give a lower rate to balance a little the totally overblown rate it has. This film looks fantastic in Blu-Ray. There are several sequences that are a real visual delight (the Paris café scene where Di Caprio's character is explaining the young dream architect portrayed by Ellen Page and the 0 gravity sequence in the second layer dream). But the problem is that beyond that you don't have much. Looks like Mr. Nolan sacrificed plot line and character developed for the technical aspects. The plot is not complex, is just convoluted. The characters are cardboard thin and underdeveloped. I never imagined dreams could be as uninteresting as in this movie. Have you ever watched Fellini's movies? Or Tartovsky's? or Cocteau's? or Buñuel's? Plenty of dream-like images there  One last word: it's a pity to gather such fine actors and waste them as Mr. Nolan did here; Joseph Gordon Levitt, Cillian Murphy and Watanabe san do what they can with the script, but Leonardo DiCaprio can't do much to give some life to his character. An utterly uninvolving movie. I'll stay with Matrix if I want a Hollywood production dealing with a superficial questioning of our perception of reality and sub consciousness.",2,12,22,26 April 2011
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," I've grown up
","I felt in love with the Star wars movie saga when these movies were released again to movie theaters in 1997. I was just a teenager back then. I just watched them again in Blu-ray and some of the old excitement is gone. I guess almost 15 years of becoming familiar with great directors and great movies and also with Sci-Fi/Fantasy works done before 1977 have made me unable to close eyes to what is wrong with Star Wars. Though the movie is still a fantastic entertainment in a childish way, it has some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard in a screen –big or small- and terrible acting. Luke Skywalker is the archetypical hero and the character has great potential. However, Mr. Hamill wasn't skilled or talented enough to flesh out the character as it was written paper thin. As result, poor Luke is just a whining teenager. Harrison Ford fares much better as the rogue space cowboy because he was a very charismatic person not because he was the best of actors. Carrie Fisher is equally flat as princess Leia. Only Peter Cushing saves the day with decent acting as well as the powerful voice of Mr. Jones. The direction is mediocre but serviceable. The soundtrack sounds better than ever in its Wagnerian intensity and use of motifs. Watch it for old time's sake. Luckily, Empire Strikes back holds the passing of time much better.",6,5,11,18 September 2011
