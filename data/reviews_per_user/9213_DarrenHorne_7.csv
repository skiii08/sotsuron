Catch Me If You Can," Charming film, with superb performance by Walken
","From 1963 to 1969 Frank Abignale Jr made the FBI ten most wanted list by performing awe inspiring confidence scams and stealing millions of dollars by forging cheques.Catch me if you can tells the story of teenage Frank (Dicaprio), as he flees a broken home and sets off to gain enough money to rebuild his family. Frank sees the respect that certain professions command and manages to successfully pass himself off as a Pilot, Doctor and a Lawyer, (all, in part, to impress his father). He soon gains the attention of FBI agent Carl Hanratty, (Hanks) who hunts him for years and gradually develops a near fatherly fondness for him.Dicaprio gives an outstanding performance that firmly establishes him as perhaps the finest actor of his generation. He perfectly blends a charismatic, cocky teenager with deep down fragility and emptiness that was caused by his parents split. The gut wrenching choose a parent scene strikes home to all of us how traumatic a parental divorce must be. The character development is spot on, from goofy teen to a worldly con man that can no longer distinguish between truth and fiction.Hanks does well, playing a bookish FBI everyman with a touch of a sinister 1950s man in black. However Christopher Walken, as Frank's father, is superb and lifts the father son scenes from over sentimental Spielberg tosh, to highly charged and touching encounters. An award worthy performance that will have you blinking back the tears.The delightfully nostalgic opening credits set the tone for this charming film that is genuinely heart-warming and fun. The trailer is misleading as this is not fast paced chase film, but a dark, character driven, true story that will have you hooked from the first few scenes. Dicaprio oozes charm, whilst at the same time showing a vulnerable, lonely side that will have you routing for him every step of the way. It is possibly 20 minutes too long, and it feels as though the last few scenes were tacked on at the end. However the end scene pulls the whole story together and gives the film a completeness that will have you smiling as you leave the cinema. An engaging and touching tale about a boys wish to be part of a family.",8,2,3,7 March 2005
Resident Evil," Not great, but not awful. Watch with your brain switched to 'off'
","I thoroughly enjoyed this zombie horror film that sets the scene for the hit Resident Evil computer game series. The sinister Umbrella Corporation runs a vast underground genetic research facility, known as The Hive, in which a viral outbreak occurs. A state of the art supercomputer, called the Red Queen, monitors the complex and responds by killing all within. The few survivors, including soldier with a conscience, Alice (Jovovich), suffer from memory loss as a result of the Queens gas attack. An Umbrella Commando team, who aims to shut down the computer and find out what has happened, soon joins them.From the opening scenes the tension is set on high as the all seeing, godlike Queen systematically eliminates the employees. The gory details are often left to the imagination, which is often far worse, particularly the decapitation scene.Fans of the game will know that the T-Virus will bring these people back from the dead as blood crazed zombies. Anderson keeps us waiting on the edge of our seats for that moment to finally happen. In the mean time he freaks us out with The Queen, who is spookily given the voice, and holographic image, of an English eight-year old girl. This works wonderfully, especially when she states 'I have been a very, very bad girl'.Jovovich is superb and wears a gorgeous red dress and mini skirt contraption, along with big black boots that show off her stunning legs that seem to lead all the way to the Promised Land. She is also kept soaking wet for much of the film.The suspense is top notch, with inventive camera angles and direction that will have you transfixed to the screen before hitting you with jump in your seat shocks. Marilyn Mansons soundtrack is ideally suited and adds to the creepy atmosphere.Unfortunately there are too many minor characters, all of which are underdeveloped and two-dimensional. This is made worse by the amount of relative unknowns, Rodriquez being the only other recognisable actress, and she delivers a monotonous performance that is far from the Vasquez like character that she is clearly based on. The dialogue and script are terrible, and some of the characters lumber along with less life than the soulless zombies that hunt them. The big bad monster is a horrific CGI creation that, thankfully, has a very brief role. This film suffers from the 15 certificate, and comes across as a little child-like. I would have liked a little more stamping on zombie head gore and greater shocks, perhaps even some genuine fear. However, it is aimed partly at the younger game playing audience and the lower certificate is understandable. The downbeat ending works well though, and will have you reaching for your control pad to play out the rest of the story.Ultimately this is a simple action/horror film that borrows heavily from films such as Aliens. There are some occasional great scenes and it is certainly worth switching off you brain and getting the beers and munchies in for some juvenile Friday night entertainment.",5,0,0,7 March 2005
Blue Crush," Great summer movie
","Do not let the poor reviews put you off, Blue Crush is a very enjoyable and touching tale with spectacular waves that will have you screaming at the screen for everyone to get the hell out of the water. They are clearly all crazy.Anne Marie (Bosworth) is a talented surfer that hopes to compete in the male dominated Pipe Masters competition. She shares a ramshackle beach house with her two friends Eden (Rodriquez) and Lena (Lake) as well as her rebellious little sister Penny (Boorem). Her life is split between a gruelling Rocky style-training regime, surfing, and working with her house mates as maids in a high-class hotel in an attempt to pay the bills. That is until the hotel is taken over by American Footballers whose quarterback Matt (Davis) catches her eye. It starts off badly, with a rather psychedelic flash back sequence that shows us the traumatic surfing experience that haunts Anne Marie and is the reason she has been out of the professional circuit for the last few years. But very soon the characters begin to win us over, primarily because it is impossible not to respect someone who regularly paddles out into over 20ft waves. Especially when they are just wearing bikinis. Boswoth gives a great performance and perfectly portrays the mixture of adrenaline, exhaustion, vulnerability and absolute terror that anyone facing mother natures at her most magnificent would feel. The waves are the most spectacular you will see on screen, with stunning camera work and sound that manages to pull you out into the water to feel the panic and fear, not just for the characters, but for yourself. The surf sequences are absolutely gripping and will have you clinging to your seat, breathlessly. On land the film holds up just as well. Even though many ideas and sequences are lifted directly from a variety of other films (Pretty Woman, Maid in Manhattan and Point Break to name a few) they are handled in a fresh way, and have plenty of laugh out loud moments to keep you entertained. The support cast is uneven, from the two brilliant big and black American Footballers to the dubious use of real life surfers and locals. However this seems to add a realism that actually works well as these few scenes can feel like the link shots used between the action in real surfing videos.It is hard to explain why this film is so good. The plot is not great, and is has been accused of being a mindless sports/action film that uses scantily clad girls for titillation. That's crap. The girls are in bikinis because they live on a beach, the camera is never lecherous and there is no nudity. This film is far less predictable than you would expect it to be and it is sincere and sentimental. It also deals with many themes that we can relate to, such as facing up to past demons, finding a sense of direction and identity, family responsibility, and how priorities change when we fall in love. Go see this film on the big screen, it's a great Romeo and Juliet story that's fun for both girls and boys of all ages. It will have you leaving the cinema smiling, perhaps with a new determination to face your own fears, or at least to try and get fit and go to the beach. A great film to get you in the mood for summer.",8,3,5,7 March 2005
Before Sunset," Before Sunset and Sunrise are Masterpieces and reviewed together here.
","Before Sunrise is one of those films you stumble across by accident, and it this unexpected confrontation with excellence that causes the audience to experience that shakabookoo moment; that Swift Spiritual Kick to the Head That Alters Your Reality Forever. Before Sunset is life, it is experience. Anyone that has ever met someone they 'kind of like' and wanted to find out more about them will know what this film is about. This is missed opportunity, this is chance, this is the roll of the dice and the one that got away. In this film a guy meets a girl on a train, they talk about nonsense as is the norm, but instead of saying goodbye and obsessing about what might have been the guy takes the leap of faith and convinces the girl to spend the next 14 hours exploring Vienna with him. Already we see perfection; already this movie is a masterpiece. Is it Ethan Hawke's scruffy American backpacker Jesse that reels us in, or the sexy Celine played by Julie Delpy? I say 'played by' but there is no 'play' in this film, there is no performance or representation. In this film the actors achieve such a level that this is nothing other than the 'real', the dialogue is of a couple exploring one another, the action is the terrified adolescent that hides in every adult, terrified of saying the wrong thing that may cause a loved one to disappear out of their life forever. The beauty of this enchanting film is how the actors communicate what is often unsaid, suggesting that they are about to say something, or make a joke, but think better of it. Vulnerable glances are exchanged; tentative gestures of affection are made. This is the truest representation of a couple meeting, and through conversation realising that they have met their soul mate, ever committed to film. It is heartbreaking to watch the impetuousness of youth dictate that the exchanging of phone numbers is a waste of time, for in youth we wrongly feel that their will be many that we connect with on such a spiritual level. The final moments of the film leave the audience perplexed, with an overwhelming desire to KNOW what happens next. It is a stroke of luck to come across this film after the sequel has been released, for to wait the nine years for Before Sunset to be released would be an exquisite form of torture. In the sequel we see the couple bump onto each other once more, and quite rightly we soon see that both carry scars from their original encounter. The memories of that one perfect night have been encased in crystal and romanticised, so that no future encounter would ever live up to that experience. There is but one option for these playthings of Cupid, they have to explore a complete relationship with one another. As each scene unfolds we look to our watch, counting down the time in which these obvious soul mates have to discover they are made for one another. Early on we feel safe, they are re-acquainting themselves with what once was, playing poker for lovers, in which cards are held close to their chest. But this cannot be maintained, and it is in Jesses company limo that we are truly dragged back into the narrative, fully committed to their relationship when Celine breaks down, screaming about the repercussions that evening had for her; when you have experienced that true connection with another person, everything else is dull in comparison. Again we check our watch, what will happen? Can we endure another departure as in Before Sunrise? The characters are now more mature and world weary; life is taking its toll. Now in their thirties they have an appreciation for each other that was lost in Venice. They have seen more of the world and realised no comparison can be made to that one night they shared together. Priorities are quickly re-arranged. What is life for? What is important? The sequel is snatched moments, fighting against a clock that continuously haunts them. Sometimes we scream for them to be truly honest with each other, to throw off their responsibilities and engulf themselves in their love, other times we fear that their lives will pull them apart, locked into an existence of wondering what could have been. The ending of Before Sunset is perfection, and should be held up as a pinnacle of film making. A scene that is so unexpected and yet so correct, that if your reaction is a cheer, a tear or a jeer, you will know in your heart that it was right, and sit looking at the screen analysing and exploring all of the 'what ifs?' that the characters will now face. The true charm of the film is not what the characters are experiencing, but the level to which every viewer will project their own life onto the screen, contemplating whether they are with the right partner, or whether at some point in the past they should have spoke up, or allowed time for that special someone. The universal response on viewing this film will be a deep down, soul aching desire to watch yet another sequel in another nine years time. Any film that can haunt its audience in this way is deserving of its title of Masterpiece.",10,0,0,6 April 2005
28 Days Later...," Could have been so much better.
","Danny Boyle moves into the horror genre with this zombie film with a twist. Combined with the writing talent of Alex (The Beach) Garland, this had the potential to be a fresh and contemporary take on the classic zombie horrors such as those by George Romeros. It fails miserably.Animal activists break into the Cambridge Primate Research Centre and find caged chimps surrounded by a continuous video stream of war, anger and hate. Somehow the scientists have created a virus of pure rage, and these animals are infected with it. The well-meaning activists then free a chimp, which viciously assaults them, spreading the virus. 28 days later a bewildered Jim (Murphy) wakes up from a coma to find the hospital, and the rest of London, silent and empty. He wanders the deserted streets looking for any sign of life. But the people he comes across have been infected and are now rabid, blood thirsty, rage crazed zombies. Two other survivors (Huntley and Harris) come to his rescue and explain what has happened. They later join up with a taxi driver, Frank (Gleeson) and his daughter, Hannah (Burns). Together they set off for Manchester, which is the origin of a military radio broadcast offering sanctuary and a cure. There they meet Major West (Eccleston) who has brutal and pessimistic answers to their predicament.Images of a deserted London, wiped clean of humanity by a virus, are both terrifying and shocking, especially as the threat of biological terror attacks nag at all of our minds. The hellish visuals of Manchester consumed by fire snuff out any sense of hope and give a sense of post apocalyptic loneliness. The despair, that haunts every scene, increases when the characters reach the army 'safe haven'. The action scenes are few and far between, but they hit hard and fast, shattering the deathly silence with violent, heart-stopping gore fests. In between there is little suspense or tension, and the slow pacing leaves us craving that next attack. None of the characters are likable, due to awful dialogue and poor decision making. This isn't helped by Burns, whose terribly performance destroys any illusion of realism and constantly reminds us that this is just a film. Its only redeeming feature is its subtext of the fragility of civilised society and how quickly we become savage and cruel when there is no authority to answer to.An unsettling film that could have been so much more, especially when compared to the superb low budget werewolf film, Dog Soldiers. Top marks for effort though.",4,2,4,7 March 2005

Gangs of New York," Interesting, but far from entertaining
","We all heard the rumours that were hurtling around Martin Scorsese's latest film, as the release date was continually delayed and stories of on set tensions were common place. None of that matters, but it did create a great deal of added publicity and anticipation. It is because of this that much of the cinema going public began to expect a popcorn blockbuster. Especially as it stars Hollywood pretty boy Leonardo DiCaprio who is now better known for the prole friendly films, such as Titanic, than his earlier grittier roles. Scorsese's films are often dark and disturbing, with unglamourous violence, in which the narrative is put before entertainment. This is true for Gangs of New York, which is actually a gangland period drama set against the backdrop of the Civil War. It is not a pleasant film to watch, and is a story of revenge and survival. It is also not a noble story of good versus evil, but of petty squabble's over race, colour, religion, politics, power and territory. It is set in the 19th Century as Irish immigrants escape the potato famine by turning up on American shores in their hordes. This leads to gang wars between the natives, led by Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis), and the Immigrants, led by Amsterdam (DiCaprio), who is also on a crusade of vengeance for his fathers death. The story is told around an overcrowded, corrupt cesspit called Paradise Square, which was actually built as a fantastic, sprawling 2-mile set piece. This set is the best thing about this film, especially when blue screens and computer-generated effects are all the rage. All the actors give fine performances, (although some of the accents do waver occasionally), especially Day-Lewis, who came out of a semi-retirement in which he was working as a Cobbler. Diaz has a strong meaty role which she makes the most of, and is certainly not there just as eye candy, as there is no place for femininity in this squalor. It is a fantastic story that almost feels like a documentary due to the superb attention to detail. It should be watched as a reminder of the darkest sides of human nature, especially as the same bigotry and irrational hate is still a part of all of our lives today. Unfortunately the uncharismatic leads fail to win us over, and we watch out of a morbid fascination that people could actually live like this, instead of caring about the outcome for the characters. There is also the tease of a great gang battle at the end of the film, which is snatched from us in a hail of cannon fire. Perhaps that would have been too much of a Hollywood ending, but I wanted it, and felt cheated as I came out of the cinema. Gangs of New York is a raw look at a brutal moment of history in which the ragged, desperate masses do anything to survive, and are then told to go and fight for the right to starve in the gutter. A powerful film, with a couple of scenes that will haunt you for a long time to come, but I just wanted to be entertained.",5,2,4,7 March 2005
