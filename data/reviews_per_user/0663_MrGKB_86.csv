Whip It," She's come a long way home...
","...from the winsome days of 'E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial,' but Drew 'Poison Ivy' Barrymore has a much longer way to go before anyone accuses her of being the female Clint Eastwood or Quentin Tarantino. Her directorial chops are far from lacking in this by-the-book debut starring Ellen 'Juno' Page, but 'Whip It''s meager performance at the box-office suggests that she either picked a poor vehicle in which to strut her stuff (possible, given the heavy geek factor of Roller Derby), or simply didn't give audiences anything to make them sit up and say howdy (more likely). I'm sorry, but if you're making a movie called 'Whip It' (about Roller Derby, of all things) and can't manage to work in at least a snippet of Devo's biggest/only hit, there's something wrong.Nonetheless, I don't mean to be too negative. Barrymore's handling of Shauna Cross' adaptation of her own novel is reasonably competent in a journeyman sort of way. I can't argue her ability to coax good performances from the likes of Page (who blessedly takes a distinct step away from her well-established teen-angst-with-worldly-attitude persona), Marcia Gay 'The Mist' Harden, Kristen 'SNL' Wiig, Juliet 'Natural Born Killers' Lewis (slumming in a sadly underwritten support role), and Daniel 'Home Alone' Stern. Barrymore does well with her cast, no question, even with the likes of relative non-actors like Zoe 'I'm really a stuntperson' Bell, Eve 'I'm a rapper' Jeffers, and Jimmie 'I'm a comedian' Fallon, though admittedly she had no business aping the aforementioned Tarantino by inserting herself into an utterly forgettable ensemble role. Sorry, Drew, you ain't no Q., despite your best of intentions.Ultimately, and as is almost always the case, the core weakness of the film is the script, with a secondary nod to the casting of Page in the lead. I haven't read the source novel (and likely never will), but I suspect it asked a lot less willing suspension of disbelief. Page as a beauty pageant regular (willing or otherwise)? No one in Roller Derby officialdom checking out her credentials? The miraculous transformation from erstwhile dilettante to seasoned jammer? These are a few of the happenstances that force the audience to turn a blind eye in order to buy into the story.Back to Barrymore: as noted, the lady wrangles actors well (the one notable failure being the inexplicably cast Landon 'I'm a singer' Pigg), but her cinematic abilities remain mundane. The actual derby sequences in the film merit some approval, but mostly left me wanting to rewatch Norm Jewison's classic 'Rollerball' for genuine genre excitement and tension, despite some nice lensing by DP Robert 'Red Eye' Yeomans. Any number of scenes meant for character development just don't get off the ground properly, a fault of the script again, but also due to Barrymore's irresolute sense of pacing. Everything's just a hair too pat and simplistic (a supposed Derby pro with the fanciful moniker, Maggie Mayhem, invites a frail pipsqueak like Page's Bliss Cavendar to try out?--C'mon!), and it all wraps up far too happily and tidily. It wouldn't take much editing to fit this film into the Family Channel or worse. Barrymore and Cross push all the right faux-feminist girl-power buttons, but really, they don't have much of anything terribly powerful to say. I'm unsurprised that it suffered an indifferent fate in the theaters; perhaps it'll do better on video.Pretty much routine viewing, in one eye and out the other. I wish Ms. Barrymore well, but also wish she'd picked a better script to cut her directorial teeth upon.",6,1,3,20 November 2010
Changeling," Quite good, but hardly a Top250 film...
","...Clint Eastwood's 'Changeling' suffers mostly from being a tad over-long and perhaps a bit too Oscar-hungry for its own good. Angelina Jolie does a nice job playing against stereotype, and Eastwood's direction is as confident and assured as we've all grown to expect, the production values are top of the line, longtime Eastwood conspirator/DP Tom 'Blood Work' Stern's camera-work is beautiful and mostly understated, letting Eastwood tell the tale without undue showiness, and the ensemble work of Jolie, etal. is of a piece, even the kids. J. Michael 'Babylon 5' Straczynski's screenplay is reasonably taut given the necessary attention to a lot of detail to make sense of the case (and let Jolie complete her character arc), but could have been tightened further. The brilliant John Malkovich is mostly wasted in a role that could almost have been written out, but I suppose a paycheck is a paycheck. I'm bemused by the heavily international weight of the current IMDb voting bloc for 'Changeling,' but as it penetrates home video, I imagine that will change.I'd have liked to have seen a stronger thematic attention to the parallels between the institutional abuse suffered by Mrs. Collins and the equally tragic abuse suffered by her son and the other children. Strange, isn't it, that we attribute distinctive personal failure to the latter, but tend to lose our focus on individual responsibility when it comes to systemic failures? I'll definitely be looking forward to seeing what Mr. Straczynski does with 'World War Z,' a zombie apocalypse novel I enjoyed a great deal.",7,2,7,11 April 2009
Walk the Line," This superb bio-pic may walk a tight line between fact and fiction...
","...but packs such a satisfying emotional wallop thanks to well-crafted storytelling from start to finish, that one easily forgives whatever inaccuracies might be noticed. 'Walk the Line,' carefully directed by James '3:10 to Yuma' Mangold, features a pair of finely realized performances by its top-rank leads, Joaquin 'Spacecamp' Phoenix and Reese 'The Man in the Moon' Witherspoon. Despite lacking any real resemblance to Johnny Cash and June Carter, both actors capture the essence of their characters with remarkable skill, having both trained intensively to sing as well as play their respective instruments with authority. Only Witherspoon took home the Oscar gold, and even though I feel that Felicity Huffman should have won that one for her role in 'Transamerica,' I still found Phoenix and Witherspoon to be utterly compelling. I haven't seen such a powerhouse combo since 'Pollack' with Ed Harris and Marcia Gay Harden. It didn't hurt having a fine script from Mangold and co-writer Gill 'Return to Oz' Dennis that outlined Cash's rise to stardom and eventual marriage (his second) to June Carter. Kudos must also be given to Ginnifer 'Mona Lisa Smile' Goodwin as Cash's long-suffering first wife, a role she plays with great sensitivity; why she didn't garner an Oscar nomination for supporting actress is beyond me. The rest of the ensemble is equally fine, along with all the attendant production values one would expect in a film of this rank. Highly recommended not only to Cash/Carter fans, but to anyone who enjoys a well-told tale of the triumph of love over adversity.",8,1,1,22 March 2008
Mission: Impossible III," Forgettable bang-bang should spell end of the franchise...
","...or at least we may all hope so.This one ended up being the second half of an unplanned double feature, the first half being 'Poseidon.' I'm almost sorry to say that 'Poseidon' was the more entertaining of the two, despite the opposite opinions of IMDb voters, who seem to exhibit typical IMDb reactions to the film, i.e. the older they are, the less they liked it. That's true of 'Poseidon' as well, of course, but the situation seems more attenuated with 'MI-3.' Regardless, I'm hoping that this will mark the end of the franchise, which was never all that much shakes in the first place, despite the star wattage of Tom Cruise and Co. The TV show, though popular, never pretended to be anything more than clever fantasy (I've always loved those fake faces they'd use, as if no one could tell the difference), and the films made no serious attempt to alter the situation. They didn't label things 'Impossible' for nothing.As I said, this was the second half of an impromptu double feature, and it failed to keep my interest successfully. Perhaps I'd already been brainwiped by 'Poseidon,' but I think it had more to do with the seen-it-all-before plot. Phillip Seymour Hoffman does a nice turn as a coldblooded dirtbag, but it's no real stretch for him, and Cruise is...well, Cruise. I liked him better in 'War of the Worlds,' and he didn't do much of anything he hasn't done before in that, either. His love interest (Keri Russell) is a virtual cipher, and his obligatory supporting castmates (Ving Rhames, Lawrence Fishburne--looking very bloated, Billy Crudup, and others, particularly a mostly superfluous Simon Pegg) all do the MI thing with competence, but none of it adds up to much more than an excuse for elaborate, unbelievable stunts. I found myself nodding off at several points in the film, which is not a good sign.If I'd seen this one first, I might have enjoyed it more, but alas, 'Poseidon' drained me of most of my thriller endurance. I'll give it another shot on DVD (maybe), but I can't recommend 'Mission Impossible 3' to any but the usual assortment of popcorn movie junkies. It's shot well, it's staged well, and it wears its budget with pride, but 'MI-3' is just as instantaneously forgettable as 'Poseidon,' and lacks the geek factor of watching a large ocean liner capsize and slowly sink, killing hundreds of people. Sorry, Tom, but you've been upstaged by a boat.",6,0,0,16 May 2006
The Expendables 2," This is what I now call a 'Julie Brown'...
","...which is to say, 'I Like 'Em Big and Stupid,' the comedian/singer's (not to be confused with MTV's Downtown Julie Brown) debut single. I used to refer to films of this nature as BSMs, but the reference to Ms. Brown's classic hit is just too good to resist, and 'The Expendables 2' is as fine an example of the genre to start with as anyone could ask.The boys are back in town, and more cartoonishly than ever. Stallone, Statham, Lundgren, Couture, Crews, and Li (briefly) are all back from the franchise opener, along with Willis and Schwarzenegger, along with the added seasoning of Liam 'The Hunger Games' Hemsworth and newcomer (to most Americans) Nan 'Speed Racer' Yu, providing some welcome ass- kicking estrogen, and the fading icons Jean-Claude 'Bloodsport' Van Damme and Chuck 'Deus ex' Norris. They all deliver the goofy goods with gusto and galloping gallantry, almost making one overlook the absurd script, atrocious dialog and impossible physics. Shelly 'Captain America: The First Avenger' Johnson's camera-work is fine and dandy, as is Simon 'Lara Croft: Tomb Raider' West's direction, thankfully keeping the action discernible; I look forward to their rendition of next year's 'Heat' (no relation to the 1995 Michael Mann classic heist film).No more need be said. This entry in the action hero smackdown franchise is as big and stupid as one could ask, so just dial the brain cells down to zero and enjoy. The body count is ludicrous, as is the story, but somehow it wormed its way into my submerged adolescent heart. I'll likely never bother watching it again, but have no regrets having burnt off a few hours otherwise. Yippee-ki-yay!",6,1,3,5 September 2013
Source Code," If you can get past the difficulties of the premise...
","...this sophomore (though not at all sophomoric) outing from Duncan 'Moon' Jones shows great promise of his becoming as fine a director as his father is/was a musician/actor. It also proves that screenwriter Ben 'Species III' Ripley has come a long way. Basically a clever riff on 'Groundhog's Day' by way of 'The Matrix' and various other alternate-reality stories, 'Source Code' limns the efforts of its hero to avert a catastrophic terror attack by way of placing his consciousness within the (somehow) reconstituted/recovered/restored eight minutes of memory of a victim of a preliminary incident on a train. How all this came to pass must be accepted as a given, but if the viewer is willing to do this, a very engaging tale awaits being enjoyed. Although rooted in an interesting intellectual plot line, 'Source Code' is, at heart, a very human story involving questions of identity, purpose, and responsibility.Story aside, the film's success rests primarily on the shoulders of Jake 'Donnie Darko' Gyllenhaal, whose performance is appropriately involved and involving; he's really turned into a fine actor. The support work is equally of a piece, no complaints there; Michelle 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' Monaghan, Vera 'Orphan' Farmiga, and Jeffrey 'The Ides of March' Wright all turn in excellent performances. Jones appears to really know how to get the best out of his cast (not to mention the rest of his production team), and I look forward to his next project, whatever it may be. Recommended to all fans of quality science fantasy, not to mention well-crafted film.",7,0,0,10 December 2011
Marie Antoinette," Ms. Coppola has directed a few good movies...
","...but 'Marie Antoinette' is not one of them. It (obviously) took me a while to get around to this one; I'd picked up a copy of the DVD a few years back, but somehow it'd gotten shuffled to the bottom of my watch list. Unfortunately, it should have stayed there, and I'll be dumping this one from my collection at first opportunity.Crippled by Coppola's horrendously boring and trivial script, adapted from a novel of questionable merit, 'Marie Antoinette' fails utterly to involve the viewer in the life of its titular lead. Oh, it presents that life, at least in its 'hi-skool lite' historicity, but there's nary a drop of real substance to any of it. It's a costume drama with an emphasis on costume and little, if any, attention paid to drama.Worse, it's haphazardly cast. Kirsten 'Spider-Man' Dunst looks nothing like the real Marie Antoinette and it doesn't help matters that she's obviously too old for the time span in which most of the film is set. Coppola's cousin, Jason 'I Heart Huckabees' Schwartzman, is notably awful as Louis XVI, an empty cipher at best; nepotism and a faint resemblance to Andy Garcia are the only reasons I can imagine that got him the role. Notables like Judy 'Georgia' Davis, Danny '30 Days of Night' Huston, Rip 'Men in Black' Torn, and Shirley 'Trainspotting' Henderson are mostly wasted in supporting roles of varying importance, and various 'names' like Asia Argento, Molly Shannon, and a stunningly unrecognizable Marianne Faithful make appearances as well. It's all for naught, since Coppola's screenplay gives them so little substance to embody. It's almost chilling to recall that she won a best original screenplay Oscar for 'Lost in Translation.' In the intervening years, she most certainly lost something herself: the ability to tell an engaging story.Production values are 'Marie Antoinette''s saving grace. Filmed on location at the sumptuous Versailles grounds and elsewhere, and minutely costumed, set designed, art directed, and coiffed and made up to within an inch of its life, prettily photographed, the only major production element I loathed was the soundtrack, an amalgam of period music and utterly out of place 'New Wave' pop from the likes of Bow Wow Wow, the Cure, and Adam and the Ants. Sonic incongruity at its most egregious.Overall, a major disappointment, highlighted only by its attention to period detail, and Ms. Dunst's tail end. Completely ignorable.",4,0,0,27 March 2010
United 93," Excellent faux documentary...
","...has yet to stand the test of time, but so long as the sting of 9/11 still tingles beneath the skins of many Americans (and no doubt many non-Americans as well), 'United 93' will remain a potent, though perhaps increasingly dated, piece of film-making. Writer/director Paul 'Bourne' Greengrass has put together a riveting recreation of the fate of the one hijacked airliner that didn't reach its target on September 11, 2001.Utilizing a cast of virtually unknown actors along with scores of actual participants in the events of that watershed day, Greengrass lays out a progression toward inevitable tragedy that begins with the terrorists' early morning preparations and ends, as we know it will, with the crash of flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Along the way, he details the breakdown of human systems when confronted with the utterly unexpected, reflecting the breakdown of systems that led to the 9/11 attack in the first place. It makes for fascinating viewing.I'm somewhat surprised to see that 'United 93' has such a high rating here on the IMDb. As of this writing, it places #237 in the Top 250, with a 34.7% '10' rating and 81.5% '7' or better. It's also garnered an unusual 7.8% '1' rating, which I attribute to the highly political nature of the subject matter. Sensitive teenage girls to the side (180 of them gave it a mere aggregate of '5.9'), it would seem that a significant portion of the 'United 93' audience was not yet ready for its portrayal of real-life sacrifice, despite the well-publicized approval and support of the families of the dead. Either that or a fair number of aggrieved Muslims slammed it.Personally, although I don't feel 'United 93' has much in the way of repeat viewability (and, yes, Greengrass' DVD commentary is fairly boring), the film still does what it does with great craft and respect for the dead. No one really knows, of course, what happened on board the ill-fated aircraft in those final minutes before it tore itself to pieces across the Pennsylvania countryside, but Greengrass' version rings true, leaving his audience inspired by the strength of human determination in the face of certain death. We never really get to know individuals in the story all that well, but we are nevertheless drawn into their predicament inexorably, ending up rooting for them to transcend history and survive the day. I was also glad to see that Greengrass avoided demonizing the terrorists, who were, after all, little more than willing, though horribly deluded, pawns in a high stakes game of realpolitik.It should be noted (if it hasn't been somewhere on this board already) that the documentary included on the DVD release, 'United 93: The Families and the Film,' is very worthy viewing in its own right. It is, in fact, more emotionally engaging than the film itself. Make no mistake, though; 'United 93' packs a powerful punch, but more so by pulling us back to that surreal day with its you-are-there storytelling rather than invitation to empathetic sorrow.At any rate, it remains to be seen if 'United 93' will maintain its position in the IMDb Top 250 as new viewers rate it from a greater and greater temporal distance from the events it depicts. Ultimately, it's a fine piece of film-making, fully deserving of all the awards it has won and will win. Unless you're one of those 'it's too soon' folks, 'United 93' is requisite viewing, if only to understand how the human spirit can remain triumphant in the face of its own inevitable destruction.",7,2,3,19 January 2007
Inglourious Basterds," Currently over-rated, but well worth a watch...
","...if only for Christoph 'You never heard of me before this film' Waltz's highly engaging performance as the lead antagonist. 'Inglorious Basterds' is nowhere near Tarantino's best film, but it's not his worst (I nominate his contribution to 'Four Rooms' for that award, although I've never seen the reportedly awful 'My Best Friend's Birthday'), and say what you will, much of it is pure pulp cinema entertainment. Only Tarantino could deliver a WWII Jewish revenge fantasy patterned after spaghetti Westerns that taps into 21st century sublimated fears and self-righteousness like a drill.'Inglorious Basterds' makes itself clear from the start, 'Once upon a time...,' and then wallows in its reference-strewn, cartoonish, fairy tale universe like a junkyard dog rolling in the dirt. The dialogue is pure Tarantino throughout, with almost all the prime monologues going to Waltz's charming sociopath. What's most striking about all this is that the bulk of the conversations are in anything but English, thus forcing the reading of subtitles, which is typically anathema to American audiences. That 'Inglorious Basterds' still managed to pack $120+ mil worth of butts into seats is testament to Tarantino's drawing power and storytelling abilities.All of Tarantino's trademarks are in evidence, most especially his ability to ratchet up the tension in a scene and then release it in a paroxysm of brutal violence. This is not a film for the faint-of-heart (as if the title isn't already a dead giveaway); there are shootings, stabbings, beatings, scalpings, and chokings galore. Tarantino's predominantly young audience was surely well-sated, given the film's inordinately high rating here on the IMDb. Older viewers were obviously not quite so impressed with the Grand Guignol.The cast is mostly superb, with the possible exceptions of the stunt-cast Eli 'Hostel' Roth (who really has little to do anyway), the equally (and inexplicably) stunt-cast Mike 'Austin Powers' Myers, and the guy playing Hitler, whose ridiculous antics I pin squarely on Tarantino's direction. The DP work by Oliver Stone stalwart Robert 'Natural Born Killers' Richardson is assuredly top rank, the editing by Tarantino regular, Sally 'did 'em all' Menke, equally so, and all the production elements are seamlessly satisfying, as expected.After one big screen viewing and a pair of DVD watchings, I doubt I'll be returning to 'Inglorious Basterds' any time soon. It's fine film entertainment, yes, so long as one bears in mind its utter lack of grounding in reality, but in the final analysis it has little to recommend it beyond cinematic flourishes, brute catharsis, and Waltz' deliciously amoral villain. Ultimately, it's pretty self-indulgent, adolescent nonsense that fails to illuminate the human condition (not that Tarantino's known for that anyway), and is unlikely to be regarded as anything more than that in the future.",7,1,4,16 June 2010
This Is the End," Self-indulgent and sophomoric...
","...Seth 'Superbad' Rogen and Evan 'ditto' Goldberg's relentlessly self- referential apocalyptic comedy has moments of genuine humor that are often neutered with juvenile excess. The opportunities for biting satire are subsumed by rampant dick jokes and similar puerile comedic fluff. The relationships of the characters never ring true no matter how wedded to reality they may supposedly be, the skewering of Michael Cera, figuratively and literally, being a prime example of such notes of falsehood.It's a shame, really, because the potential was there. I don't quite feel that I wasted my time with this one, but I know that it won't be too long before I've forgotten it completely. I should have just watched 'Dogma' again, and if you haven't seen either one, that's the better choice.",5,2,5,29 December 2013
Dawn of the Dead," Workmanlike re-imagining
","(Edited from a post to IMDb 'DotD04' BB, with DVD-release emendations in *asterisks*) In 'Dawn of the Dead (2004)' Director Zack Snyder has crafted an interesting, though flawed, thrill ride of a film that cribs the scenario---a plague of the reborn dead intent upon devouring the living---and the shopping mall setting of George A. Romero's classic 'Dawn of the Dead (1978)', and precious little else. Purist fans may be offended, but this reworking of Romero's consumerist satire is entertaining, if somewhat skimpy on substance; Snyder and screenwriter James Gunn have twisted elements of Romero's story to suit the needs of a revved-up, post-millennial audience. We get a child zombie, but this time right up front and gruesomely disfigured to boot. We get a 'Steve' to love to hate, but he's not a lead. We get the mall, but it's not as much a haven to be secured as an insecure prison. There's no biker gang breaking in; our heroes are instead forced to break out. The zombies are as hyper as Mikey on four bowls of Life cereal, but just as appropriately gruesome and scary as their cousins doing the Romero shuffle. We get a dose of homage, including a Gaylen Ross storefront and a CGI-flyby of the WGON helicopter. We get Max Headroom as a guy who looks like the original Roger and dies like him, but without the 'I'm going to try...not to come back!' along with the original Roger as a haggard general, Ken Foree reworking his classic tag line, 'When there's no more room in hell' and Tom Savini chewing scenery as a sheriff. We get a spectacular exploding head, but it pops near the end of the film, and it happens to someone we like. We get an unsettling 'happy' ending, which is then tagged with a deliberately confusing 'unhappy' postscript mixed into the credit reel.What we don't get is much in the way of character development, and next to nothing of Romero's wry social commentary, unless one takes the underlying nihilism of the film to be thoughtful insight. Snyder's inspired opening and title sequences paint an uncompromising nightmare of civil disorder and a failure of authority to deal with crisis. Medical personnel are more dangerous than useful: a doctor shows more interest in golf than an unusual bite case, an ambulance runs down Ana's neighbor. Bus drivers are potential carjackers, the first cop Ana meets points a shotgun in her face, and later, security guards offer anything but. The military tucks its tail into a helicopter and runs, while the broadcast media seem to collapse overnight. Our band of survivors is left to its own devices, and the film's zeitgeist is very much every man for himself. Or as Kenneth says, 'F*** y'all.' The film leaves more questions open than it grudgingly answers. Some are immaterial (how did the zombie plague originate?), some are niggling irritations (why wasn't Vivian as aggressive as the other zombies? Why do zombies possess the vocal cords of wild animals?), and some are whimsical (why kill a baby zombie; what's it going to do, gum you to death?), but some are crucial to the internal logic of the story. How did Andy die and do the zombie two-step so fast? *This is explained in the DVD release in a short 'home-video' as a combination of weakness from starvation and bad luck* Why did Luda take so long to die, compared to the fat lady in the wheelbarrow? Why did the bite victims in Ana's hospital take so long? Where were the zombie children and teenagers? Where were all the other dogs, and why wouldn't zombies eat them? How did Ana and her husband manage to remain unaware of the growing chaos outside their house? Big question: why, once they were secure within the cornucopia of the mall, didn't our protagonists exploit those resources? Why didn't they dress protectively? Why didn't they improvise more weapons, especially flammable ones? Why didn't they scrounge up a short wave radio, or try to access the Internet? *Andy apparently web surfs in his home video, but this avenue is quickly squelched* Why didn't Snyder and Gunn put a little more thought into their story?Fast zombies are a chilling variation, but they defy the laws of physiology for the sake of frenetic film-making. Snyder and Gunn have catered to the eMpTyV, short-attention-span crowd and jazzed-up Romero's much more disturbing shamblers, if not for the sake of hectic-editing junkies, then as justification for the swift spread of zombie infestation. One can only guess how Andy barricaded his shop so quickly. *Even the home video ignores this* Fast zombies (or 'zoombies,' as one inspired IMDb BB writer dubbed them) surely expend more energy than slow ones; flesh and bone breaks down without refueling, and corpses don't have much in the way of fresh oxygen and nutrients. Eyes cloud when fluids dry up. Joints stiffen; internal organs shrivel. Suspension of disbelief falls by the wayside.Despite its plot flaws and questionable character development *some of which is mended in the DVD director's cut*, I enjoyed this reworking of Romero's seminal classic. Some of the visual effects were less than convincing, but the make-up was effective, the acting was commendable, the overall apocalyptic vision was well-realized, and the storytelling was well-paced, if problematic. I enjoyed revisiting the delicious horrors of zombie invasion, but---and it may simply be because I am now a quarter century older and that much more jaded---'Dawn'04' didn't give me nightmares like the original did. If I had to pick one of the two for a desert island DVD collection, it would have to be Romero's inspired, shoestring-budget masterpiece over Snyder's pricier, workmanlike debut any day of the dead, pun fully intended. Still, I give 'Dawn'04' a 6 out of 10; it's nearly as frenetic as the zombies with which it's populated, but just as empty-headed as well.",6,4,8,21 August 2005
World War Z," At risk of stirring up the brain-dead hordes on this site...
","...I have to say that 'World War Z' is not a bad piece of mindless entertainment. I trust whoever reads this understands I am damning it with faint praise. Truth is it's a perfectly watchable production that will eventually sink into the great mass of otherwise undistinguished perfectly watchable productions that comprise the bulk of the film industry's output. And in this case, Sturgeon's Revelation notwithstanding, I say so what?Its major distinction is that it's the first (and will possibly be the only) high-budget tent pole zombie film ever made. If it manages to turn any sort of profit worldwide (and the early indications are positive), there will surely be a follow-up, and for all but the most rabid gore-soaked zombie fans, that's far more encouraging than the thought of the upcoming 'Independence Day' sequel. I caught it at a $5 matinée and did not feel cheated; at full price, I admit I might well have thought otherwise. Viewer mileage will vary depending on one's allegiance to the source material, Max Brooks' novel.Said novel is essentially a compilation of post-apocalypse accounts, virtually un-filmable except, perhaps, as a mini-series. Brad Pitt & Co. chose to retain only the basic scenario (worldwide zombie plague) and the title; hey, they paid for it, they can do with what they wish. Brooks may have whined, but he still cashed the check, didn't he?Be that as it may, 'WWZ' turns out to be a competent action-thriller with a primary attraction of nicely portraying a genuinely international disaster without an overload of 'Oh, c'mons!' beyond the core premise. It's essentially '28 Days Later' on a global scale. Nutshell: Watchable, dispensable product. Hardcore zombie fans will not be pleased.",6,8,15,27 June 2013
Hostel," Not as bad as some; not as good as it could have been
","I caught this one on a whim and a few spare hours between shifts at work.I could have chosen better.From the random bits of hype I'd read or heard, I gathered the film would have some dark, underground edge to it. Guess I gathered wrong. A step up from 'Cabin Fever,' yes. Still full of 'oh, c'mons!' like when these three boneheads ingest unknown chemicals at a nightclub at the behest of these two bimbos they've barely met, pun intended. Or when our hero blithely runs down three of his antagonists in an audience paroxysm of righteous retribution, including backing up to finish off the one he somehow didn't kill outright, and manages to get away scot free.It's not nearly as frightening as it could have been, because there's little sympathy built for the three ostensible protagonists. They pretty much blunder drunkenly into the web of torture awaiting them without ever having revealed much in the way of a redeeming trait.Still, they don't deserve what they get, do they? Well, maybe not, but at any rate, the cinematography is very good, the acting gets better as the film moves along, and there's plenty of gore for the splatterhound. If the storytelling had been more artfully crafted, I might have given this a better rating. This one just played like a bad fairy tale.",4,0,1,17 February 2006
Constantine," I'm probably too generous in rating this...
","...but it does feature an outstanding performance by the always appealing Rachel Weisz, as well as worthy turns by Djimon Hounsou, Peter Stormare, and Tilda Swinton (as the Archangel Gabriel, no less!) Unfortunately, it also stars Keanu Reeves as our titular antihero, perhaps his worst miscasting since Coppola's flawed 'Dracula.' Reeves struggles manfully to convey the world-weary angst of a man condemned to hell for the sin of suicide, battling demons for the chance of redemption, but it just doesn't play all that well. John Constantine comes off as some sort of Catholic version of Neo from 'The Matrix.' Weisz, bless her, acts circles around him, carrying the film to its somewhat suspect climax. I don't dislike Reeves as much as some on this site, but Constantine is not a Neo, and he and his tyro feature film director, Francis Lawrence, late of some not-unmentionable music video fame, just don't seem to get that. (Side note: it's with great trepidation I anticipate Lawrence's helming of the Will Smith vehicle, 'I Am Legend.') I'm not overly familiar with the comic book on which the messy plot is based, but I gather it's so much more than this movie. Listening to the DVD commentary confirms that the 'Constantine' screenplay is a committee affair, and it definitely suffers accordingly. Still, the effects and overall production/art design are top-notch, which at least makes the film fun to watch. The visualization of Hell is effective, and there are various eyecandy treats like a demon formed from bugs and other icky things. The theology is very Catholic, requiring a great deal of willing suspension of disbelief from all but the most devout, and the numerous plot holes yawn almost as wide as the gates of Hell itself.If it's pseudo-religious rock'em-sock'em action you want, I'd recommend 'Hellboy,' which keeps its tongue firmly in cheek, avoiding the pretentiousness of 'Constantine.' If you're looking for an excellent adaptation from comic book sources, try 'V For Vendetta,' which does everything right that 'Constantine' does wrong.",7,2,3,26 May 2006
Chicken Run," Another Aardman plasticine triumph...
","...which, although it fails to solve the riddle of which came first, the chicken or the egg, nonetheless fits its 80-minute running time as smoothly as an egg in its shell. Nick Park and Peter Lord, the heart and soul of the illustrious Aardman Animations, deliver another superb piece of stop-motion entertainment, this one a riff on 'The Great Escape,' only it's chickens trying to escape their rubber-booted owners and the threat of a chicken pot pie machine. It's great stuff, nicely written, and gorgeously conceived and executed, pardon the pun. The only thing I thought was sadly lacking was a 'chicken crossing the road' joke, and it's possible I just missed it. Eminently worth a rewatch. And another...'I told you they was organised.'",8,0,0,26 August 2012
Orphan," Very entertaining despite its flaws...
","...'Orphan' marks auspicious debuts by the story/screenplay team of Alex Mace and David Johnson, as well as a thoroughly engrossing starring turn from newcomer Isabelle 'Hounddog' Fuhrman. There's no question in my mind that this little lady will be an actress to pay attention to in upcoming decades; she is simply outstanding. The rest of the ensemble are no slouches, either: Vera 'Quid Pro Quo' Farmiga and Peter 'Flightplan' Saarsgard as the unsuspecting parents, CCH 'The Shield' Pounder as the kindly nun, Margo 'Madge' Martindale as the oblivious shrink, and even Jimmy 'Poseidon' Bennett and the adorable newcomer Aryana 'I really am deaf' Engineer as the kids in peril. Production values are uniformly top-notch, John 'The Usual Suspects' Ottman's score is appropriately unsettling, and Jeff 'A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010)' Cutter's camera-work is of a piece.I'd have given 'Orphan' even higher marks (and may, in fact, decide to downgrade it on further viewing) if not for the plot hinging on some extreme suspension of disbelief. The ending's twist simply begs far more questions than it can reasonably answer, deflating the impact of the whole affair. Also, and this could easily just be me, I found it somehow difficult to feel much sympathy for such an obviously comfortable, secure family (despite the parents' 'problems'); I found myself rooting for the 'bad seed' through much of the film, since she was the most interesting, engaging character. There were also a number of 'oh, c'mons!' scattered throughout the story that weaken it, which I will leave to Constant Reader to discover.Regardless, 'Orphan' is actually pretty decent entertainment if you don't think too hard about its omissions and elisions, certainly worth a rental and/or cheap DVD purchase.",6,0,4,30 October 2009
Terminator Salvation," As good as one might expect from the director of 'Charlie's Angels,'...
","...Joseph 'McG' Nichols' entry into the Terminator franchise is a fairly relentless action flick that best serves to establish the apocalyptic firmament of 2018, and set the stage for whatever sequels are intended to move our heroes, John Connor and Kyle Reese, toward their inevitable destinies. To bring things full circle, so to speak, which is, unfortunately, perhaps the fatal weakness in an otherwise mildly serviceable screenplay by co-writers John D. Brancato & Michael Ferris, who brought us 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' lo, these several years ago. As is the case with all serial stories, and especially those involving time travel and its attendant paradoxes, when you start filling in gaps in an over-arching storyline, you lose a certain amount of dramatic tension, since you know how certain things must turn out in order to maintain the integrity of the story. In 'TS,' we *know* that John Connor will not die until he hooks up with Kyle Reese. We know Kyle Reese will not die until he goes back into the past to sire John Connor. On the plus side, we also know we're going to encounter one bad-to-the-bone T-800 before the credits roll.There's plenty of astonishing eye candy along the way, courtesy of ILM and a host of other sfx companies, some at times astounding camera-work by Shane 'Into the Blue' Hurlbut and Michael 'this is my first big one!' Fitzgerald--check out the helicopter sequence with Connor's crash landing, wow!--and overall production values reflecting a multi-hundred-million dollar motion picture. Danny 'Oingo-Boingo' Elfman delivers a score that meshes well with the kinetic mayhem on screen, and two accomplished leads of variable notoriety, Christian 'The Dark Knight' Bale and Sam 'Avatar' Worthington, head up an ensemble of human resistance fighters battling them nasty machines to ever-lovin' death. Willing suspension of disbelief is, of course, absolutely required to assuage lingering questions like 'Where do humans get their food and fuel?' and 'Where are all the maintenance robots?,' but things move along at such a steady clip that you don't have much time to consider such brain teasers. Besides, you should have already checked your brain at the entrance to the cinema.'Terminator Salvation' will never attain the iconic status of the first two films in the franchise, but it manages to hold its own with the unfortunate 'T3:RotM,' and opens the door to further storytelling. Only time, the box office, and Mr. Bale's temper will tell.As a Memorial Day weekend wannabe-blockbuster, 'Terminator Salvation' may not have any brains, but it's got a strong heart. Purists will be distraught, while action junkies will just suck up the bang-bang.",7,2,4,21 May 2009
Match Point," Atypical Woody Allen script...
","...but very typical strong direction by same of engaging cast kept this night-owl's attention quite handily. I'm not quite the avid fan that many Allen aficionados are, but certainly recognize 'Match Point' as one of his finer works. Faultlessly framed in the lens of DP, Remi 'Elizabeth' Adefarasin, Allen's tale unfolds in the best Syd Field tradition, wrapping up with a neat little thematic ending. Although Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a bit too mannequin-pretty for my taste, and I always felt he was up to no good right from the get-go, the rest of the cast is outstanding. From the radiant Scarlett 'Eight Legged Freaks' Johansson to the wonderful Emily 'The Pink Panther' Mortimer, Brian 'Braveheart, no, Rob Roy' Cox, suave Rupert 'Spooks' Penry-Jones, geeky character actor Ewen 'Black Hawk Down' Bremner, and the winning Penelope 'Shaun of the Dead' Wilton, the entire ensemble is perfect. I'm almost surprised that the core IMDb cohort of 18-29-year-olds liked this one so much; it gives me faith in their taste in film.",8,0,1,26 January 2007
Zodiac," Not quite as strong as I had heard....
","...'Zodiac' nonetheless serves as an interesting examination of the effects of obsession on individuals, most particularly upon the man from whose book James 'Spider-Man 4' Vanderbilt's screenplay was adapted. That man, Robert Graysmith, a newspaper cartoonist with a peripheral interest in the case (rubbing shoulders as he did with journalists directly involved), eventually became preoccupied with identifying the notorious 'Zodiac killer,' a California nutjob who killed seemingly at random and then tormented the populace with confessional braggadocio via letters to various newspapers, and to law enforcement officials as well.All in all, David 'Alien 3' Fincher's decidedly unstylish film strikes me as a big-screen Movie of the Week, packing little of the emotional punch of 'Se7en' or 'Fight Club' or 'Panic Room,' his three most accomplished works to date. Whatever cat-and-mouse tension is generated in Act One while the killer is going about his dark business is soon dissipated when his rampage peters out and the story zeroes in on Graysmith's obsessive pursuit and its effect on his personal life. When Graysmith finally confronts his boogeyman, it comes as only mild satisfaction; the viewer is left wondering, 'Okay, now what?' Unfortunately, that question is rendered moot; the man fingered by the film as the killer died before the law could bring him to justice.Still, 'Zodiac' is quite watchable. The acting features competent portrayals by the likes of Jake 'Brokeback Mountain' Gyllenhaal as the determined cartoonist/investigator, Robert 'Chaplin' Downey, Jr. as a journalist laid low by the events, Mark 'Just Like Heaven' Ruffalo as one of the lead police investigators stymied by the case, and John Carroll 'Fargo' Lynch as a wonderfully creepy suspect in the case. Numerous other 'name' actors fill out the cast, but 'Zodiac' really isn't about the acting. In fact, in some ways, I found the profusion of identifiable faces to be somewhat distracting; the film may well have played better without them, ala 'United 93.' A perfect example would be Chloë 'Trees Lounge' Sevigny as Graysmith's wife, a thankless role at best, and hardly one that stretched her acting chops one iota.Regardless, everyone acquits themselves well, and the production vales are top notch, including Harris 'American Gangster' Savides' digital cinematography, Angus 'Panic Room' Wall's careful editing, and composer David 'Norma Rae' Shire's relatively unmanipulative score. The soundtrack of pop songs is evocative and appropriate without being too cutesy.Unfortunately, the sum of the parts is somehow less than the whole, and 'Zodiac' offers little in the way of repeat viewability, which is why I can only give it a '7.' Its attention to detail may be of interest to fans of crime procedurals, but even the intricacies of the journey cannot mask the disappointment of the arrival at journey's end.",7,1,3,14 February 2008
Cloverfield," An ambitious monster movie that can't crawl out from under its vapid script...
","...'Cloverfield' represents a triumph of what is known as 'viral marketing' (mainly lots of teasers scattered about the Internet), which secured it a powerhouse opening weekend and more than enough butts in the seats over its theatrical run to guarantee a sequel, but in terms of storytelling left an awful lot to desire. As Shakespeare would have described it, the film amounts to 'a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing.' I caught this one second-run, and am glad I economized.Screenwriter Drew 'Lost' Goddard is unable to transfer his success in television to the big screen, primarily by failing to get the audience to identify with his characters, despite spending the bulk of 'Cloverfield''s first act introducing them. By the time they start dying, I didn't really care one way or the other; I had no emotional investment in them. Now, perhaps that's because I'm no longer a 20-something. But, my kids are, and I think that's the key; these 20-somethings didn't remind me of my kids, or any of their friends. They had no real identity, or real personality. Rob (Michael 'The Black Donnellys' Stahl-David) is a VP of something-or-other heading for Japan to do who-knows-what. His brother, Jason (Mike 'Poseidon' Vogel), has thrown a surprise bon voyage party for him, and among the attendees are Jason's girlfriend, Lily (Jessica 'The Covenant' Lucas), Rob's best buddy, Hud (T.J. 'Carpoolers' Miller), who ends up as the film's cinematic POV, Lily's friend, Marlena (Lizzy 'The Class' Caplan), and Rob's ex-lover, Beth (Odette 'South Beach' Yustman), who leaves the party early and provides the supposed motivation for the rest of the cast's trek across a monster-mashed NYC. Some might say she's little more than the film's MacGuffin, and they wouldn't be far wrong. Beth and the rest of the main characters have nothing in the script to latch onto to flesh themselves out, and seem virtually interchangeable. They're barely more than the impersonal statistics they'd have become otherwise had the camera not been there to record them.Then again, it's just a big ol' monster movie, right? And it's the rare monster movie that provides us with characters we care about. 'King Kong' (both versions) springs to mind, as does 'Jurassic Park' and a few others. Even 'Gwoemul/The Host' does a better job of eliciting our empathy than 'Cloverfield,' despite the cultural dissonance of the former. The acting is nowhere near as bad as some critics have complained, but Goddard's script just doesn't give them enough to wrap their chops around. More's the shame, because Matt 'Felicity' Reeves does a remarkably good job for not having directed a feature film since the forgettable 'The Pallbearer' over a decade ago, and the production values are outstanding, including the herky-jerky digital cinematography by Michael 'Lost' Bonvillain, and superb SFX work by the likes of Tippett Studio ('Robocop') and Double Negative ('Pitch Black').It's all in the plotting, and 'Cloverfield''s story is a simple one: boy has girl, boy loses girl, boy meets monster, boy rescues girl, boy and girl end up unhappy ever after. The film has its share of 'oh, c'mons,' mostly ones involving the dubiously-motivated actions of its leads, but the audience's visceral thrill at being in the center of things somewhat overcomes that. Still, this viewer was left with the feeling that Goddard should stick with scripting television; small wonder that 'Cloverfield' clocks in at barely 80 minutes.I'll watch 'Cloverfield' again when it's released on DVD, but I'm not sure it'll find a place in my collection unless it has a ton of extras. Despite the stylistic similarities to the much more engaging 'The Blair Witch Project,' this marketing monster just doesn't have the same legs.10.21.08 edit: Having finally caught up to the DVD (thank you, public library!), I stand by my comments above. My viewing companion mostly agreed with me, but did note, interestingly enough, that she was reminded of 'Friends,' and suspects that the story was subconsciously written with that show in mind. Rob is Ross, Beth is Rachel, Jason and Lily are Chandler and Monica, Marlena is Phoebe, and Hud is Joey. Makes sense to me, and gives the characters more than enough back story to make them more engaging. The DVD includes a number of featurettes, a director commentary, deleted scenes, two vaguely 'alternate' endings, and a few previews. The transfer is excellent, really showcasing the technical achievements of the film. Too bad it really wasn't a long episode of 'Friends'; now that would have been memorable!",6,0,2,11 March 2008
Once," Easily enjoyed more than its title suggests...
","...writer/director John Carney's sophomore full-length outing is a nice piece of entertainment that economically treads the line between outright movie musical and extended form music video. It's very low budget, shot on HDV, starring a guy and a gal who are in no way marquee names, but its economy and simplicity work to the film's advantage. It's a simple tale of boy-meets-girl, with an equally simple premise that both are talented musicians and both are pining for lost loves. Their complementary talents lead to collaboration and potential entanglement. Refreshingly, the leads really *are* talented musicians, earning a 2008 Oscar for Best Song (and a small raft of other awards as well), and if not the Irish Gary Oldman and Chloe Webb, acting-wise, they hold their own. The obvious musical bond lends authority to their relative lack of acting chops; the net effect is a very naturalistic, almost documentary feel. The music, written by the leads (Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová), is predominantly plaintive, angst-y folk-pop, so if you don't care for such tunes, you'll be less likely to enjoy the film, but the songs fit, each advancing the plot and/or emotional underpinnings, which is why 'Once' feels very much like the aforementioned long-form music video or even a full-out musical. The main thing is that it all works, the lo-fi production values (which are still quite nice), the often hand-held camera, the unpolished acting, the naturalistic settings, an intelligent script that doesn't try to call attention to itself, it's all wonderfully, decidedly non-Hollywood, a sweet, refreshingly innocent little film. Ymmv, of course, but I found it well worth the time spent with it.5.1.12 edit: I'm pleased to discover that this rough gem has been, indeed, turned into a theatrical musical, and apparently fine-tuned to such a degree that it's been found Tony-worthy. All the more reason to see this fine little film and enjoy!",7,0,2,18 August 2009
The Hateful Eight," Grand Guignol comedy at its stickiest...
","...and faithfully presented in the guise of a panoramic (literally) Western mashed into an Agatha Christie closed-room whodunit, along with various prior Tarantino tropes (not the least of which being the ubiquitous Samuel L. Jackson), 'Hateful Eight' remains unlikely to place terribly high in the pantheon of cinema, let alone in the rankings of Tarantino offerings. Expansive 70mm presentation to the side (a choice brutally defanged by non-theatrical viewing), the plot leans heavily on coincidences that beggar the meaning of serendipity and trademark Tarantino verbal excursions of rhetorical diarrhea that tend to tax one's patience. While I'll admit I enjoy such excesses at times, Tarantino pushes them just a little too hard here, with Samuel L.'s taunting monologue directed at Bruce 'Need you ask?' Dern's Confederate general being a prime example. There are times when Tarantino can't restrain himself; you'd think after so many years he'd have matured a bit more. 'Hateful Eight' isn't a film that demands repeat viewing. It'll make its way into my video library eventually, but I'll be in no hurry about it; a return to his early work remains much more appealing.",7,0,3,30 July 2016
Ocean's Twelve," Eminently forgettable
","A few years ago, Steve Soderbergh made a clever little heist film. Well, really, he remade a heist film from the '60s. It featured a healthy dose of star power. The remake, that is. Well, so did the original, but most of them are dead now, so he got new ones. Pitt, Clooney, Damon, Roberts, Garcia, etc., etc., etc. And it was all set in Vegas, the self-admitted epitome of hip American glitz. And money, let's not forget the money, because that's what this film is all about. Making money. Stealing it, even.'Ocean's Twelve' serves as perfect illustration of the desperation Hollywood must feel when it has a hit film on its hands. How to best milk a new potential franchise, especially one that doesn't have its own set of source materials (i.e. books or comics or video games) to provide the sequels? How to keep a long-stale formula (the crime caper) fresh? Why, just add another star to the mix, shake, stir, and pour into the collective consciousness of the indiscriminate, entertainment-fixated public. Dispose of any logic or believability. Feel free to break the fourth wall, just for the fun of it. Make most of the film one red herring after another. Throw a few more stars into the mix, uncredited, just so the audience can admire the hipness of it all. A few odd camera angles, some hand-held shots, more self-conscious star mugging, a plot that only a committee could love, and voilà! You've got a final product that is...(return to summary)Good job, Hollywood! What's your next cheap trick?",5,7,9,11 April 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Compelling adult fairy tale...
","...left this viewer sitting in quiet wonder. Auteur Guillermo del Toro, previously responsible for the immensely entertaining 'Hellboy,' and the at least visually remarkable 'Blade II,' along with a better than expected 'Mimic' and cult favorite 'Chronos,' shows himself to be at the top of his form in this violently beautiful film. There's no question in my mind that I'll be looking forward to 'Hellboy II,' as well as '3993.'Lensed with absolute mastery by Guillermo 'Jackie Brown' Navarro, 'El Laberinto del Fauno' (Pan's Labyrinth) is the story of a young Spanish girl on the cusp of adolescence, deeply immersed in the fantasy world of her own vivid imagination, who ventures into that fantasy world in reaction to the difficulties of life in war-torn fascist Spain in mid-1944. Whether that escape into magical realms is 'real' or simply a product of her overwrought psyche dealing with the daily horrors of her situation is a question the audience must answer for itself; del Toro is careful not to make the decision himself, and the film is all the more powerful for it. The production design, art direction, costuming, make-up and sfx, the sound fx, the score; all are deliciously detailed and extravagantly perfect, even when they make the audience cringe with horror or repulsion. In truth, 'El Laberinto del Fauno' is as close to a fully realized modern Grimm's Fairy Tale as one could hope.The acting is excellent all the way around. Relative newcomer Ivana Baquero is appealingly innocent and resourceful as Ofelia, a little girl caught up in the whirlwind of life's harsh realities. Seasoned veteran Maribel Verdú, an actress I am thrilled to have finally discovered, plays Ofelia's confidante with resolute grace and, as it turns out, revolutionary strength. I can only believe that she is well-respected in the Spanish-speaking acting community, and beloved by her audiences. Ariadna 'Belle Époque' Gil is wan and sympathetic as Ofelia's doomed mother, and I trust is equally respected and loved.Wonderful as the women are, special deference must be paid to the incredible performances of Sergi López as the villainous Capitán Vidal (a man so cold-hearted that he can stitch up his own filleted cheek with barely a peep of the pain he dispenses so readily to his enemies), and the inestimably talented Doug 'Hellboy' Jones in the dual roles of Pan and the Pale Man (his vocal readings as Pan are outstanding, absolutely awesome once you realize he doesn't speak Spanish) (3/10 edit: I was sorry to discover that his voice was dubbed over by another actor, though that hardly lessens his physical performance) 'El Laberinto del Fauno' is, quite simply, remarkable and deliriously effective, and firmly cements del Toro's growing reputation as a director to watch closely. Be warned: this is not a movie for children. The violence is quite brutal and graphic (though never gratuitous), as it is in the best of fairy tales; lessons are not learned when artlessly censored. 'El Laberinto del Fauno' speaks to the child within, but does so with the unswerving eyes of an adult. It will definitely be a keeper on DVD.",8,3,6,10 February 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," A bloody good-looking tale of revenge...
","...though certainly not for all tastes, Tim 'Mars Attacks' Burton's adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim musical showcases yet another twisted performance (and singing, no less!) from Johnny 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' Depp as the vengeful barber with a wicked set of razors. Depp's star power makes it small wonder that the woefully outnumbered female contingent on the IMDb liked this one even more than its stereotypically bloodthirsty male cohorts, with the exception of 45yo+ females who no doubt cringed at the graphic bloodletting and corpse-dumping.Despite the complaints from many of his purist fans, Sondheim apparently approved of Burton's vision; I've never seen the stage production, and had no problem with the altering/dropping of various songs, any more than I did with the filmed versions of 'Rent' or 'Little Shop of Horrors.' What works onstage doesn't always play as well on film.Depp's performance is of a piece with his previous outings with Burton; one can hardly avoid being reminded of 'Sleepy Hollow,' 'Edward Scissorhands,' and even 'Corpse Bride.' That he sings decently is reward enough, but it's his acting that brings the character to life (and death). Helena Bonham 'Frankenstein' Carter rises to the challenge of Mrs. Lovett, the lady who aids and abets culinary legerdemain, and does some commendable singing of her own. Alan 'Die Hard' Rickman assays his typical effete villain with ease (and some delightfully credible singing), while Timothy 'Gothic' Spall feeds audience bloodlust with an equally slimy turn. Sacha Baron 'Borat' Cohen is hilarious as Todd's first victim. Newcomers Jayne Wisener and Jamie Campbell Bower don't fare as well as the subplot's young lovers; they sing quite beautifully, but Wisener's part is too one-dimensional and Bower is too androgynously fey to be believable. No matter; the show is still pretty much Depp and Carter's and they mostly shine, or at least as much as one can do so within the grimy shades of Dickensian London.Needless to say, the style and vision is pure Burton, lovingly realized by the likes of Production Designer Dante 'Gangs of New York' Ferretti, Art Director Gary 'Children of Men' Freeman, and longtime Burton collaborator, Costumer Colleen 'Ed Wood' Atwood. Dariusz 'Dark City' Wolski's camera-work is evocative, eloquently limning Burton's dingy, squalid London while providing the necessary movement to keep things proceeding apace. Likewise, Burton stalwart Chris 'Wolfen' Lebenzon's editing shaves scenes as tightly together as one of Todd's razors might.The film is not without its flaws, though, one of the most prominent being Burton's insistence on showing us every last corpse hitting the killing floor of Mrs. Lovett's subterranean cookery. The welter of spurting arterial blood I could understand, but the continual crunching of victims onto stone like a sack of potatoes got old quick, and seemed like overkill. Your appetites may vary.Still, a fine piece of work by Mr. Burton, etal., regardless of the limited appeal to general audiences. Recommended, though not for children, of course.",7,0,0,13 September 2008
Underworld Awakening," In one eye and out the other entertainment...
","...is pretty much the nicest thing one can say about this fourth installment in the fangs-and-fetish franchise that is 'Underworld.' Kate 'Pearl Harbor' Beckinsale once again assays what will forever be her signature role as the vampiress warrior in form-fitting black. Despite the guidance of her auteur husband, Len 'Live Free or Die Hard' Wiseman, her performance takes her nowhere she hasn't been already, and the slipshod four-author script remains ample evidence of why this make-work project failed to generate much box-office excitement for any but the franchise faithful. Tons of action, loads of CGI and gore, the lure of 3D (yay!), and of course the tantalizing lure of Ms. Beckinsale's lethal dominatrix-in-disguise; you'd think that the prized audience of adolescent-to-30something males would have slavered all over this one. Apparently, they did not. So much for insatiable testosterone.It's interesting to note that IMDb voting has declined both qualitatively and quantitatively as the franchise continued, yet the much smaller female contingent consistently scores it better (to the tune of a full half point) than the Y-chrome cadre, most likely due to the strength and self-confidence of Beckinsale's heroine. I find that somehow refreshing. Perhap the cause of female empowerment has actually won some inroads into entrenched paternalism and misogyny.No matter; back to the film. As always, it's the script that drags this installment down into the ranks of dispensability. As almost always, multiple writers: questionable results. The key loss, I think, was Danny McBride as lead scripter; I'd be interested in finding out why he parted ways with his co-creation. I've always treated the series as a guilty pleasure at best, in which style surpasses substance (and often only due to a sheer deficit of the latter), but it held a certain campy charm that has finally dissipated in this recent entry. The finale assuredly promises a future installment, but I can't say that I'm anticipating it. I'd rather see what Wiseman has done with the retread of 'Total Recall,' and that only barely.Late-night boredom and/or fanboy viewing only.",4,2,5,14 July 2012
Shutter Island," Yet another over-rated Scorsese outing...
","...that leads me to question (once again) the movie-going sensibilities of the 'common man' as represented by the denizens of the IMDb. I am utterly perplexed that this high-grade bit of noir-ish filmmaking has so impressed the masses; its current rating is far too generous for what's been delivered. Much like 'Avatar,' Scorsese's latest is all about style and very little about substance. The 'twist' to the story is so transparent that it becomes obvious long before the film is over, thus rendering the final reels an exercise in tedium. Hearkening back to the days of Hitchcockian psychological thrillers, replete with obvious dreamscape tropes like vertiginous cliffs, revelatory caverns, and hallucinatory warnings, 'Shutter Island' mines its territory with no small degree of authority, but no lesser degree of familiarity and lack of tension and surprise. The professionalism of the work is admirable, but its creativity and heart are, sad to say, pedestrian and unremarkable. I have no doubt that the novel on which it was based is a better read than 'Shutter Island' is a viewing.Scorsese scored his best box office to date with 'Shutter Island,' so I suppose I shouldn't complain too loudly about how he's been progressively dumbing down his product (although, then again, maybe that's exactly what I should be complaining about); it's at least small blessing that his repeated collaborations with Leonardo 'Titanic' DiCaprio have born financial fruit. Using established collaborators/luminaries like DP Robert 'Kill Bill' Richardson, production designer Dante 'Casino' Ferretti, and a host of name actors (even in peripheral roles) certainly didn't hurt, but unlike the aforementioned 'Vertigo' and others of its stature, 'Shutter Island' is destined to recede from the fickle memory of the great unwashed masses to take its place in the immense repository of 'better than a sharp stick in the eye' films that Hollywood churns out by the hundreds.What is it with the lapdog idolization of Scorcese by the predominantly adolescent/young adult IMDb legions? The man has helmed a solid pantheon of 'great' movies, including 'Taxi Driver,' 'Raging Bull,' 'Goodfellas,' and arguably 'The Last Temptation of Christ' (and perhaps even 'The King of Comedy'), but this is little reason to elevate his lesser works to equal heights. Are his fans here on this site truly that indiscriminate, or unschooled? Perhaps it has to do with the man's intimate devotion to popular music, as evinced by films like 'The Last Waltz,' 'No Direction Home: Bob Dylan,' 'Shine a Light,' and the upcoming 'Sinatra;' I don't know. All I know, I suppose, is that Scorsese is finally getting his due, and I suppose that isn't all bad. If it takes LCD work like 'Shutter Island' to do it, I guess I'll accept it. But it won't change my perceptions of quality storytelling one iota, nor my dismay at the easy acceptance of average as excellent by the bulk of young moviegoers.",6,3,6,27 August 2010
Life of Pi," Whatever flaws this film may have...
","...are joyously outweighed by its sheer visual brilliance and embrace of life and love. Being a translation of a novel means 'Life of Pi' can be, at times, a bit confusing perhaps, but the overall narrative remains strong, and the protagonist is such a rich, well-defined character that the viewer can't help being drawn into the story. I won't belabor things; others have done that quite nicely elsewhere on this site. Let it simply be said that this is a film that any cinemaphile will enjoy, perhaps even despite whatever prejudices or predilections they may suffer. I can't comment on the 3D, since I saw it flatscreen, but when I get the opportunity to see it that way, you can bet I will.Highly, highly recommended.",9,2,5,14 March 2013
Corpse Bride," Clever enough, but...
","...nowhere near as clever as 'Nightmare Before Christmas,' though I'm not sure I can put my finger on why. Still, I'm not surprised that it polls well here on the IMDb, and especially with the female contingent; the 'good' girl got her simple but goodhearted man, while the 'bad' girl gave up what she wasn't intended to have, yet still got revenge on the party who betrayed her. Hard to argue with 'all's well that ends well.' I'm also not surprised to see that the 45+ cohort gave it the lowest marks, much lower than they gave 'Nightmare Before Christmas'---this one just isn't as clever by half (although it has its moments), which I will ascribe to Burton meddling with the directing of it, along with Elfman's average (for him) score and songs. Despite the improved stop-motion animation, which I loved, the imagery and story left a strong feeling of retreading of older material. In fact, the story itself reminded me of some old European folktale, whatever it may have been.Still, 'Corpse Bride' has a lot going for it. The animation is exquisite and expressive, a joy to behold. The voice work is spot on, from the upper tier names like Depp and Watson right straight through to Enn Reitel's Maggot/Town Crier. Children under 12 might be a bit lost, but anyone with a love of animation will be pleased. The only reason I gave it a 7 instead of an 8 is its apparent lack of repeat viewability; that may change in the future when I catch it again on DVD.",7,1,2,2 December 2005
Gone Baby Gone," Ben Affleck's directorial debut shows more promise than his acting...
","...perhaps because 'Gone Baby Gone' is apparently near and dear to his heart. Based on the novel from the guy who wrote 'Mystic River,' with a decent screenplay by newbie Aaron Stockard, 'Gone Baby Gone' is set firmly in the midst of Affleck's beloved Boston; 'Beantown' ambiance permeates the film thanks to some superb 2d-unit photography and the wholesale cooperation of the neighborhoods involved, all the better to tell a gritty little tale of kidnap, murder, and subterfuge. The ensemble cast, headed by the director's younger brother, Casey 'Soul Survivors' Affleck, is near-perfect, its weakest link being Michelle 'Eagle Eye' Monaghan, and even she's really not terrible, just not quite credible as Affleck's partner in the private investigation game. Standouts include Amy 'The Wire' Ryan as the white-trash mother of the kidnapped child, Amy 'Field of Dreams' Madigan and Titus 'Deadwood' Welliver as concerned relatives, Ed 'The Abyss' Harris and John 'Beverly Hills Cop' Ashton as the cops involved, along with the ever-reliable Morgan 'need you ask?' Freeman as the final link in the mystery that young Affleck's P.I. is trying to solve. Beautifully framed and shot by John 'Tropic Thunder' Toll, scored without too much overt manipulation by Harry 'Shrek' Gregson-Williams, and with great production values for a sub-$20mil venture, 'Gone Baby Gone' may be a tad predictable, but is still an engrossing melodrama deserving of the time spent watching it. The younger Affleck proves that his work in 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford' was no fluke, and the elder amply demonstrates that his talents behind the camera may well exceed those in front of it.",7,0,0,4 October 2008
Watchmen," Hurm! What you see is what you get...
","...as seems typical with Zack '300' Snyder projects. Visuals compelling, story not so much. Screenplay reveals limitations of source material. What was hip in mid-80s not so interesting today. Implications of superheroism sophomorically explored. Literate veneer of graphic novel stripped away. Major plot developments anachronistic. Characters even flatter than in graphic novel. Performances acceptable but mostly workmanlike, except mine. Little genuine humanity for audiences to connect with. Just not people we care about to any significant extent. Alternate timeline distancing, irrelevant to current socio-political situation. Needs updating badly.Source material comic book deconstruction of comic book superheroes. Intriguing in its day, far from top-rank literature despite accolades from Time Magazine. Film version would have worked better as deconstruction of film superheroes. Has nothing new or terribly interesting to say about human condition, most of which conforms to simplistic black/white dualistic thinking, not nearly as visionary or groundbreaking as maintained.

28 Weeks Later," Serviceable sequel has its moments...
","...but fails to add much of anything substantial to the action/horror genre in which it wallows. This is not entirely a bad thing, but despite the numerous glowing reviews here on the IMDb and elsewhere, '28 Weeks Later' is no 'Aliens' or 'Terminator 2' in the pantheon of sequels. It's simply an extension of the original's storyline and style with a bigger budget.Still, there's much to recommend '28 Weeks Later' to the genre aficionado. The acting is top-flight, especially from reliable names like Robert 'The Full Monty' Carlyle and Catherine 'Braveheart' McCormack (who is rendered looking much worse for the wear than her normal lovely mid-30s), along with strong work from the likes of Jeremy 'North Country' Renner, Rose 'Troy' Byrne, Idris 'The Wire' Elba, and the preternaturally captivating newcomer Imogen 'V for Vendetta' Poots. Writer/director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo helms the film with a sure hand, notwithstanding the signature shaky-cam action sequences, although I suspect there were one too many fingers in the scripting pie to deliver a truly outstanding product. Enrique 'Down in the Valley' Chediak's cinematography carries on the look and feel of Danny Boyle's original nightmare, mostly thanks to Chris '28 Days Later...' Gill's at times frenetic editing. The production design, art direction, set decoration, costuming and so on and so forth are all excellent, placing us squarely in a ravaged, depopulated Britain amidst a militarized zone of returnees intent on reclaiming their homeland.The film's weakness is, as mentioned, the script. It suffers from a number of 'oh, c'mons' that can't be ignored, some worse than others. How did the abandoned Alice escape the onslaught of Infecteds at the cottage, let alone make it back to London and survive there? Why was security so lax in the Green Zone that Don's swipe card gave him access to his wife? And why oh why wasn't said wife under extremely heavy guard? These problems, and others, took a lot of air out of an otherwise respectable story that contrasts the bonds of family with the inexorable requirements of society. I don't know; perhaps further viewings will give me answers to these questions, allowing me to bump my rating a notch, but meanwhile I can't recommend '28 Weeks Later' to anyone other than fans of the first film. It boasts plenty of jump-scares and gory sequences, most notably a gruesome set piece in which a helicopter is used as a giant weed-whacker, but suspension of disbelief is something the audience has to wrestle with just a bit too much to make '28 Weeks Later' a stand-out experience.",6,3,6,25 May 2007
The Hills Have Eyes," Director Aja shows great potential...
","...especially on the heels of 2003's thriller, 'High Tension,' which played with similar themes of savagery and blood vengeance. His approach to horror cinema is uncompromisingly brutal and appropriately cathartic, and will delight hardcore fans everywhere. Others may not be so pleased, as the comments on this board amply indicate. Of course, why these 'others' would ever bother to watch a film like 'The Hills Have Eyes' (in either incarnation) is pretty much a mystery, but I digress.Well-lensed by Maxime Alexandre (who also DP'ed Aja's 'High Tension') and tightly edited by Baxter (ditto), this post-millennial retelling of the Wes Craven classic strikes its audience right in the face with its bloody allegory of America's xenophobic nightmares, Mexico and Iraq. I'm surprised that other commentators haven't seen this yet, or perhaps they have and I just haven't caught up with them. Seemed pretty blatant to me, though. Representative white-bread conservative family unit (with one black sheep) marooned in the remote desolation of New Mexico that turns out to be a restricted atom bomb test site (read: U.S. military flexing its muscle) is beset upon by a family of homicidal subhumans (ostensibly created through the mutating influence of radioactive fallout) who live troll-like in the equally abandoned gold and silver mines of their forefathers. Mayhem ensues. Survivors become as much via rapid descent to the animal level of their assailants. The ol' red savagery of tooth and claw, or in this case, pickaxes, baseball bats, and German Shepards.Or maybe I'm insane. At any rate, Aja slowly ratchets up the suspense in his first act, building character and filling in back story, then smacks you in the head with a gobbet of wet flesh in the second, and serves up an even bloodier catharsis of vengeance in the third. The two biggest names in the cast, the aptly-cast Ted 'Silence of the Lambs' Levine and Kathleen 'Breakdown' Quinlan, are dispatched first, quickly followed by the beautiful Vinessa 'Eyes Wide Shut' Shaw. The parents' kids, Dan 'I'm a lot older than I play in this movie' Byrd and Emilie 'Lost' de Ravin and the babe's hubby, played by Aaron 'X2' Stanford, turn in bravura performances as they battle the brood of mutant cannibals (read: Ay-rabs and Messicans) trying to kill them. The baddies sport a fair number of character actors, including Robert 'Land of the Dead' Joy, Billy 'I haven't done anything notable since 'The Untouchables' but I sure get work' Drago, and Tom 'You've seen me in all kinds of stuff even if you can't remember my name' Bower. The gore is copious and unflinching, courtesy of the genius of Greg Nicotero and Co., whose work seems to be everywhere these days.Aja, along with co-screenwriter, Gregory Levasseur (anyone beginning to see a highly tense pattern here?) keeps the stakes high as well. The family dog, Beauty, isn't just killed, she's eviscerated graphically. The father isn't just killed in front of his family, he gets burned alive so realistically you'd swear you could toast marshmallows by the scene. Next thing you know, Sis and Mom are dead or dying, younger Sis has been raped and traumatized, and things are looking pretty bad. They only get worse. I won't bore you with any further recap, but will say that although the grand guignol finale sadly slips into Hollywood overkill (Robert Joy, lie down! Yer dead!), it's still far more effective delivering orgasms of sanguine catharsis than 2005's 'Hostel,' a darkly-minded pretender to the 'Straw Dogs' throne.Upshot of this meandering comment: this one's a keeper, especially when the director's untrimmed cut is released on DVD. It has its flaws (can anyone say, 'bad CGI birds? I knew you could! How about, 'twist ending obviously designed to set up a sequel?' Sure you can!), but far fewer than either of Rob Zombie's cinematic visions or the overrated Aussie contender, 'Wolf Creek.' Definitely not for weak stomachs or those who cringe at the very idea of threatening helpless women and babies, let alone grown men.I'll be looking forward to Aja's future efforts, disturbing as that concept may be.",7,2,4,23 April 2006
Knowing," Weak sci-fi melded with pseudo-religious bunkum, signifying nothing...
","...more than Hollywood's ability to part poorly-educated American adolescents (and adolescent minds) from their parents' money. I knew 'Knowing' was going to disappoint as soon as I saw three names credited for the screenplay. Checking here confirmed that initial misgiving; these are the folks who helped inflict a wretched 'Boogeyman' upon the world. Needless to say, I'm not looking forward to what they're going to do with the upcoming remake of 'The Birds.' Still, I had some hopes that director Alex 'The Crow' Proyas, who'd also helmed the deliciously bizarre 'Dark City,' might come through again. Alas, this was not to be, despite what I'm assuming were his best efforts, given that he helped produce the thing as well. As is almost always the case, the main fault lies in the script, which, though compelling on the surface, is utterly flawed.I'll try to be succinct. 'Knowing' basically posits an alien race with god-like powers, including incredibly detailed (and accurate) prognostication and faster-than-light space flight. These aliens have determined some fifty years in the past of the film's current events that the Sun will suffer a coronal mass ejection which will cleanse the Earth of all life. They choose to notify a select group of humans of this terrible fate in order to (presumably) lead these lucky people to various sites around the planet, from which the aliens will take them onto their ships and transport them to a new and far distant world where these survivors can 'start over.' Isn't that special? One such pair of survivors is notified via a coded message planted in a time capsule, and received by the son of a crack astrophysicist M.I.T. professor (Nicolas 'I'll take that paycheck, thank you' Cage). The clever, drunken prof manages to eventually crack the code and get the message (in bits and pieces) via a very nearly preposterous series of coincidences and a serious dollop of serendipity, including being witness to a spectacular airplane crash. One bit of silly business after another finally leads him and the two children to the proper lift-off point, and everything is resolved neatly, sort of.Now, without going into further detail about the silliness involved in all this, I pose the simple question: why doesn't this incredibly advanced extraterrestrial civilization simply use its obviously incredible technology/magical powers to build a proper shield to protect the 'doomed' planet and its miserable inhabitants? How hard can that be for a race so amazingly advanced that it can see into the future? Are they just picky about who gets to live? Do they think there are just a handful of humans that are worthy of salvation? Is it all really just 'God' working His mysterious ways? It boggles the mind nearly as much as the stupidity of films like 'Independence Day' and others of that ilk.That said, 'Knowing' does feature superb production values: great special effects, some startlingly effective visuals, decent if unremarkable acting, good sound, and capable direction. It's the story that falls flat on its face. There's a garbled attempt to pin some epistemological and/or ontological explanation for this skullduggery via a confused metaphysical argument, but none of it makes a lick of sense when considered for more than a second or two.Other posters here have detailed some of the more egregious flaws in the script (cf. a time capsule stored under a manhole cover that any determined jackass could and would remove at a moment's notice with very little effort), so I'll leave Constant Reader to discover them on their own. Suffice to say, this is just more mindless eye candy for the indifferent masses, and only barely worth watching. Apocalypse geeks will get off on the destructive imagery, Nicolas Cage detractors will have a field day with his hair, teeth, and phone call acting, and no one will give a fig for the poor thing within twenty minutes of having watched it.Time-wasting viewing only. I give it the rating I do strictly for the visuals, and its narrow escape from utter mediocrity by the narrowest of margins. Best rented for free, and certainly not worth purchasing unless you're (perhaps) a Rose '28 Weeks Later' Byrne groupie. You've been warned.Nicolas Cage really, really, really needs a better agent, not to mention a slap upside the head with a wet fish.",5,2,5,1 November 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," A worthy continuation of the Apocalypse
","I was fully expecting to be disappointed with this film, especially after what I considered the existential failure of 'The Matrix: Reloaded,' earlier this year. Pleasantly, I was not. Any movie that starts off with a nuclear bang is okay in my book, and things picked up nicely thereafter.Arnold does the thing he does best (laconic one-liners), Nick Stahl is a suitable replacement for Ed Furlong (mostly due to decent acting chops and a certain resemblance to Michael Biehn), the effects are pretty much flawless, the chase sequences rock, the Terminatrix is a satisfying upgrade from the T-1000, and the ending is not only a darkly enjoyable conclusion to the (relatively thin) plot (which is pretty much a retread of 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' minus Sarah Connor), it leaves things nicely open-ended for yet another sequel. I left the theater feeling that I got my money's worth; what more can you ask?My only complaints would center on the script's reliance on a number of coincidences that raise the eyebrow of believability (including the otherwise enjoyable cameo appearance of Dr. Silverman), and what I felt was the miscasting of Claire Danes. I'm not sure why I felt that way, as I consider her to be a gifted actor, but she just rubbed me the wrong way. I suppose repeated viewings will soften my opinion, perhaps. (3/10/07 edit: I just learned that Sophia 'The Hitcher' Bush was originally cast in Danes' role, but was let go shortly after production began because the director felt she was too young. One can only wonder how this film would have fared thus cast...) Nutshell opinion: T3 moves the franchise forward with workmanlike style and panache, and leaves the viewer anticipating the next chapter. My hope is that when 'T4' rolls around, we get to see Arnold playing the human being upon whom his Terminator was modeled.",6,0,0,8 July 2003
Over the Hedge," A thoroughly entertaining little fable...
","...about the value of friendship and belonging, 'Over the Hedge' is perhaps the first genuine animation notch in Dreamworks' belt. My suspicion is that the source material, Michael Fry's popular comic strip, is the reason. The characters are carefully delineated and superbly rendered in a clean animation style that very much reminds one of the comic, and the story is family-friendly yet still retains an adult wit about it. Pointed barbs are thrown at consumerism and suburbia amidst an otherwise simple tale that focuses on a raccoon named R.J. (voiced to perfection by Bruce Willis) who has to replace the food stores of a threatening bear (Nick Nolte, chewing the scenery with vocal intonations of implied violence) by conning an unlikely pack of foragers into helping him raid the cornucopia of human society 'over the hedge.' Ample vocal assistance is provided by the likes of William Shatner, Allison Janney, Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara (do these two ever work separately?), Garry Shandling, Steve Carell, and the wonderful Wanda Sykes, along with a host of others.It works, and works well. Dreamworks has, I think, come up with its first animated feature (yes, even beyond 'Shrek') that compares favorably with the best of Pixar. I've yet to purchase 'Cars,' (although I did see both in the theater) last summer's animated competitor to 'Over the Hedge,' on DVD, and so cannot make a back-to-back judgment, but I know it's going to be difficult to decide which film has true legs (i.e. which one will I be most eager to share with grandchildren) and which one will sit on the shelf. Hopefully both will have their days of rapt attention in the player, but I suspect that anthropomorphic animals will win out over cartoon automobiles.",7,0,0,4 January 2007
Wanted," Russian auteur vies with Zack Snyder for title...
","...of king of the empty-headed eye-candy movies, but has to do it with a 'Speed Racer' quality script. The results are kinetic but utterly forgettable. James 'Atonement' McAvoy is an nerdish accountant ripped from his obnoxious life by Angelina 'you have to ask?' Jolie and a bullet fired by a slumming Thomas 'Stalingrad' Kretschmann. Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am, and McAvoy's an instinctual super-assassin charged with bringing his purported father's killer a steaming helping of tit-for-tat.Jolie's got the tats (and the others), and otherwise respectable actors like Morgan 'Driving Miss Daisy' Freeman and Terence 'The Collector' Stamp take undoubtedly sumptuous paychecks enacting the slim comic-book plot, but it's all for naught. The visuals are fine and dandy, lots of whoo-hoo bullet trajectory shots and physically impossible stuntwork, and a pounding soundtrack and so on and so forth, and it all still comes to naught. The characters are cardboard cut-outs, the dialogue is 'Fight Club' lite and even more pretentious; in short, everything is such a cartoon that it packs all the emotional wallop of a Looney Tune. That, in and of itself, is not necessarily a bad thing, of course, but in the case of 'Wanted' it is. It's such an obvious stab at setting up a new franchise that it instantly deflates itself.Time-killer viewing only, check brain at door. It gets a six from me strictly for the stylish visuals, and even then, just barely. Director Timur 'Night/Day Watch' Bekmambetov is quite capable, but this dispensable junk was not really up to his standards. Watch at your own risk of boredom and ridicule.",6,1,3,25 March 2009
The Machinist," 'A little guilt goes a long way...'
","...and makes 'The Machinist' a film you simply can't tear your eyes away from, and not just because of how astoundingly Christian Bale starved himself down to skin and bone for the role of Trevor Reznik, a man who hasn't been able to sleep for a year and is suffering for it both mentally and physically. Or is there more to it than that? Tightly scripted by up-and-comer Scott Kosar, who did a tolerable job on the 2003 remake of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,' along with last year's 'The Amityville Horror,' which I haven't seen yet, and is slated for screen writing duties for the updating of George A. Romero's 'The Crazies,' and directed by auteur Brad Anderson, whose prior work is unfamiliar to me, but will hopefully not remain so, 'The Machinist' is a prime psycho-thriller along the lines of 'Memento,' 'Fight Club,' and numerous others mentioned elsewhere on these boards. I can't say I've seen such an effective portrait of psychological disintegration since Catherine Deneuve's descent into madness in Roman Polanski's classic 'Repulsion.' In addition, Xavi 'Darkness' Giménez' stark cinematography, cast in washed-out blues, grays, and greens, the immaculate art direction of Alain Bainée, and the remarkably appropriate score by Roque 'Sexy Beast' Baños all contribute to the film's sense of unavoidable deterioration and inescapable doom. The acting support from Jennifer Jason Leigh as a sympathetic prostitute, Aitana Sánchez-Gijón as an equally sympathetic widowed waitress, Michael Ironside as an unfortunate victim of Reznik's psychosis, and John Sharian (sporting an awesome set of choppers and one of the oddest disfigurements in recent memory) as Reznik's sinister nemesis, Ivan, is uniformly effective. There really isn't a false note in the entire film; one finds oneself drawn completely and utterly into Reznik's Dostoyevskian, Twilight Zone world, replete with signposts up ahead, all the little hints that lead us along with Reznik to the film's ultimate revelations.Certainly 'The Machinist' is not a film for everyone. It's a grim picture, a portrait of a man drowning in his own paranoia and confusion and suppressed guilt. In some respects, it's like watching something very unsettling in slow motion, a living nightmare that, unlike Bale's tormented character who craves the blessed peace and oblivion of sleep, you want to wake up from. Thankfully, at film's end, Trevor Reznik does 'wake up' and confront the source of his torture in a resolution that is somewhat predictable (if only to the inveterate film buff), but logically and emotionally satisfying.Highly recommended to those who appreciate the superior acting chops of Christian Bale, as well as thriller fans who love Hitchcockian mind play. Don't miss the visual nod to 'Psycho!'",8,2,3,30 June 2006
Control," Sorry to see this rock'n'roll bio-pic did such poor box office...
","...not only in the U.S. of A. (where Joy Division was at best a cult band), but apparently in England as well, where the central character's band, Joy Division, was far more well-known. Such a shame, since 'Control' is a well made, if somewhat slow-paced and (no surprise here) depressing film. Evocatively shot in black and white by Martin 'The Countess' Ruhe, and directed by Depeche Mode (and others) video artiste, Anton Corbijn (also a former NME photographer and longtime Joy Division fan), 'Control' limns the short, bleak life of Ian Curtis, the band's ill-fated lead singer.Beautifully acted by leads, Sam 'On the Road' Riley and Samantha 'Sweet and Lowdown' Morton, along with a fine supporting ensemble, 'Control' paints a stark portrait of a young man unable to weather the intertwining conflicts of love, notoriety, and adult responsibility. It wasn't love that tore him apart, so much as it was (as the film's title seems to indicate) an inability to deal with his own poorly developed self-control. Being epileptic assuredly didn't help, no doubt exacerbating Curtis' depressions and sense of helplessness, but ultimately the final arbiter of his suicide was no one and nothing but his own fragile, conflicted will. He had a fine wife, a child, an expanding place in the sun, a vehicle for his creative impulse, and yet he couldn't help but throw it all away, first by betraying his family and ultimately by betraying himself. 'Control' has plenty of moral questions to pose, and to the filmmakers' credit offers neither facile nor concrete answers. The sparse, linear screenplay by Matt Greenhalgh (who's written another script now in production concerning John Lennon's early life) is based on a Curtis bio written by his widow (which I've not read), and feels fairly objective and non-judgmental, at least to this viewer. I suspect that the director's personal relationship with the Curtises had much to do with that.In a nutshell: absolutely worth a watch for Joy Division devotees, Morton and/or Riley fans, and lovers of small, effective character-driven cinema. Highly NOT recommended for puerile mainstream audiences who regard Transformers movies or gimmicky films like 'Cloverfield' as high art.",6,3,4,21 June 2009
Enchanted," A pleasant diversion from typically bland Disney fare...
","...that I probably wouldn't have even commented upon but for the somewhat unusual breakdown of IMDb user ratings. As of this writing, nearly 2 out of 5 voters are female--a bias not totally unexpected, but still seemingly out of the ordinary on this site. Also unsurprisingly, the ladies liked 'Enchanted' more than their male counterparts, by a full half a point or more, with the interesting exception of the 45+ cohort, who for whatever reason (no patience for sappiness?) liked it less than their male counterparts to an equally significant degree. I would bet you someone could write a decent term paper on the situation, given the chance to do further research and/or surveys/interviews with the voters.No matter. 'Enchanted,' the brainchild of screenwriter Bill 'Premonition' Kelly and director Kevin '102 Dalmatians' Lima, is a decidedly on-target send-up of formulaic Disney product that takes a great premise (how would the inhabitants of a typical Disney animated fairy tale fare in the 'real' world?) and gently satirizes the genre and its conventions while still delivering a very standard Disneyesque message (true love isn't blind, but thrives with mutual understanding and respect). Well-acted by a fine ensemble cast, and gorgeously produced in every aspect, 'Enchanted' is meant to appeal to all ages, just as many of the old classic Disney films were, animated or otherwise. Amy 'Psycho Beach Party' Adams is all naïveté and saccharine goodness as the misplaced Giselle, James 'The Notebook' Marsden is perfect as her well-intentioned but utterly boneheaded Prince Char--I mean, Edward, Patrick 'Grey's Anatomy' Dempsey is winningly vulnerable as Giselle's real world swain, while Timothy 'Sweeney Todd...' Spall, Susan 'Joe' Sarandon, and Idina 'Rent' Menzel all have great turns in support. There are plenty of in-jokes and tributes and what-not, amusing product placement (what, you expected anything else in a Disney film?), and a script that refuses to treat its audience like brain-dead consumer units. 'The Princess Bride' this is not, nor is it as funny as, say, 'Looney Tunes: Back in Action,' but 'Enchanted' is still highly recommended by this viewer as quality family entertainment that adults can enjoy without blushing.",7,2,2,8 October 2008
Alien vs. Predator," Death knell of two franchises?
","One can only hope not. I held off on watching this one until I found it at the library, and for once was not overly distraught that it was a full-screen copy. Widescreen would have been a negligible improvement. Paul W. S. Anderson is not one of my favorite directors, though there were bits and pieces of films like 'Soldier' and 'Event Horizon' and even 'Resident Evil' that I enjoyed. He has a good visual flair, if nothing else. However, he's not much of a screenwriter. 'AVP' plods, to put it kindly. The characters are pretty much made of cardboard, and the plot, such as it is, is uninteresting and derivative. Anderson plays fast and loose with the 'Alien' and 'Predator' mythoi and fails to bring anything new to either one. The action was a rehash of previous 'Alien' set pieces. Much whining has been heard over the PG-13 rating, but for the level of violence, I was surprised that it didn't get an R (and here I thought even one use of the F-word would guarantee that--guess I was wrong). I imagine AVP played better in theaters with speakers booming, but on the small screen it was remarkably unexciting and uninvolving; I put it on pause numerous times to go smoke a cigarette. Our doughty female lead played her part above and beyond the call to duty, but no Ripley was she. The rest of the cast was essentially faceless but tolerable (the little spiky-haired blonde was a cutie, I will confess; I'd like to see her in something with genuine substance). Lance Henrickson was obviously collecting a paycheck. Even the 'surprise' ending was cliché (and highly illogical). Overall, it played like a fanboy comic book aimed at the pre-teen set. I gave it a 5 only for high production values and excellent FX.",5,1,2,23 August 2005
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," A visually sumptuous Western bio-myth...
","...'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford' is Aussie auteur Andrew 'Chopper' Dominik's sophomore effort, and a fine one it is thanks to an intelligent, compelling screenplay, strong production values, and top-rank acting all around. Though shot in Canada, the film captures late 19th century America with a painter's vision. The photography by the esteemed Roger 'Sid and Nancy' Deakins veers at times into the territory of exquisite, especially in conjunction with the powerful score by Nick 'Birthday Party' Cave and Warren 'The Road' Ellis. The story centers on the odd relationship of the title characters: the one a charismatic bandit, a family man on the run, the other an idolatrous youth who becomes far more invested in his anti-hero than he ever imagined. Brad 'You have to ask?' Pitt portrays James with suitable gravitas and sympathy, while Casey 'Soul Survivors' Affleck surmounts the obvious age disparity between himself and the character he plays with a fully nuanced performance that simultaneously attracts and repels, easily earning his Oscar nomination for the role. The supporting cast is strong as well, notably in the persons of Sam 'Galaxy Quest' Rockwell as Charlie Ford, Garret 'Deadwood' Dillahunt as Ed Miller, and Paul 'Elizabethtown' Schneider as Dick Liddil. Sadly, Mary-Louise 'Grand Canyon' Parker is mostly wasted as James' wife, and Zooey 'Almost Famous' Deschanel likewise as a minor character. Of even greater interest to me was the definite suggestion that James recognized Ford as the agent of his own conflicted suicidal tendencies. Opinions I've read elsewhere of a homo-erotic subtext between the two characters are, I think, unwarranted. Regardless, '...Jesse James...' is cinematic art of a high order, despite its novelistic, episodic nature (c.f. the voice-over and various flashbacks), and highly recommended by this reviewer.",7,0,1,12 September 2008
Twilight," Oh, boy! Another horrendous franchise in the making!...
","Do please color me bemused and uninterested. 'Twilight,' adapted (from the first volume of an immensely popular series of fantasy romance novels aimed at tween- and teenaged girls) by Melissa 'Dexter' Rosenberg, a dance major turned writer/producer, and directed by Catherine 'Thirteen' Hardwicke, was a remarkably successful seat-filler last year ($190mil+ on a budget of $35mil+) that's about as bloodless and fangless as the 'vegetarian' vampire our self-involved little heroine falls for. I realize I'm not a member of the film's target audience, but there it was at my local library, free as free can be, so I thought I'd give it a shot and see what all the lucrative fuss was about.Not much.As a romance, 'Twilight' is tepid at best. Other than staring at each other with a variety of expressions that range from constipated to toothlessly suggestive, the leads have no apparent chemistry (and this despite their apparent off-screen relationship). Their motivations are an amorphous murk. Other than his James Dean-ish good looks and funky eyeballs, what is it she sees in this icy-cold oaf? Did she really enjoy kissing refrigerated lips? And why is this inhuman Dorian Grey so taken with a simpleton teenager? What, simply because he can't read her mind? I suppose this is all silliness that only a teenaged girl can understand; I sure don't. Give me Romeo and Juliet any day; heck, if you want vampire romance, give me 'Near Dark' or 'Once Bitten,' or even 'Fright Night.' Beyond that, Kristen 'Panic Room' Stewart is still an appealing young actress, and I'll watch about anything she's in, even if she hasn't refined her ability to choose prime roles yet. I can't say the same for Robert 'Harry Potter...' Pattinson, who left me as cold as his ostensible character; right now he's one of those actors who makes you think, 'The lights are on, but nobody's home.' The production values were fine, Eliot 'Vamp' Davis' camera-wrangling was good, if at times a bit too music video-ish, the art direction and so on and so forth, all good for a multi-million dollar picture, but in the end...? In the end, it's all for nothing, because the story is tedious drivel, most of the characters cardboard cut-outs, the entire conceptual framework unconvincing (sparkly vampires that run around during the day?)...in an oft-repeated phrase of mine: think Sturgeon's Revelation. 'Twilight' is junk food disguised with an artful salad, empty calories that provide no nourishment whatsoever.I can only imagine what deviant impulses have led the older males on this site to rate this thing higher than their younger cohorts (unsurprisingly, the females are just the opposite). Edit: this has now changed, presumably due to video distribution; interesting.You can bet I'll be avoiding the inevitable sequel(s), and unless you're an adolescent female, I'm betting you will be, too.",5,1,4,27 August 2009
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," About as anticlimactic as I expected...
","...and if it weren't for the top-rank design and effects, I'd have likely never gotten through it. As it is, it took me three days. Of course, I never could manage to finish the book in the first place, more than forty years ago, so that may have something to do with my lack of enchantment. What struck me is that the whole thing is 'The Lord of the Rings' redux. Look, it's another quest! Look, it's got a bunch of the same characters, and we know nothing bad will happen to any of them because then they couldn't show up in 'The Lord of the Rings.' Look, here's another action sequence straight from a video game! Yawn.Strictly for Tolkien fans, and apparently a good number of them are disgruntled by the additions/subtractions that Jackson & Co. have effected. The uninitiated likely won't care, but will still be daunted by this film's bloated running time. Trust me, you're really not missing a whole lot beyond eye candy. This isn't a bad film; far from it. It's just...unnecessary.12/16/13 edit: Got the chance to see the extended version in 3D BluRay recently. My comments stand, plus an observation that the extra sequences add nothing special. Part II has just opened to the expected 'holidaze' success, and I'm betting it's more of the same: dispensable entertainment, in one eye and out the other.",6,3,7,10 April 2013
Saving Private Ryan," One of Spielberg's crowning achievements...
","...'Saving Private Ryan' is likely to remain in my Top 10 Favorite War Movies for a long, long time. I'm taking the time to post this edited version of a review I wrote back when I first saw the film (opening night, 1998) not because I think anyone on this site will care (or even read it), but because I feel compelled to work on covering a wide variety of my favorite films on this site. I watched the film again a few days ago (probably at least my twentieth viewing), and wanted to reflect on the differences in the initial viewing experience compared to this recent one.'Saving Private Ryan' is a film about honor, at its core, and is as genuine a salute to men who have laid down their lives for their country as anyone could ask. Director Spielberg and writer Robert Rodat deliver a ferocious look at the intensity of modern close combat and its effects on its participants, and raise questions for which there are no confident answers, if indeed there ever have been any at all.The structure of the film is symmetric, opening and closing in a Normandy military cemetery, where an aging vet and his family visit the grave of a fallen comrade. Book-ended between are two blisteringly enervating combat sequences and an episodic journey through horror and hard questions.I say the film is about honor, and it is. What else is an act of saving someone else if not an act of honor? And in the process of doing so, the most difficult of all choices must be made--whether to sacrifice one's own life that others might live, or make 'the other poor, dumb bastard die for his country.' Spielberg's exploration of this dilemma follows several paths and, in keeping with the general tenor of the film--terrifying, numbing, disorienting, and possessed of a great sorrow--he never provides sophistic or glib answers. He leaves us at film's end still reeling from the dense insanity of a desperate bridge defense, with an old man who after all the passing years still struggles with unanswerable questions.Where is the honor in war? What is the relative value of a man's life? On a personal level, is there anything worth the risk of unimaginable pain and suffering? Other films have tackled these questions in the past, but rarely had such visceral impact. A sniper's duel culminates in a blasted eye socket that makes the audience cringe; a sapper is blown to jelly by a defective 'sticky bomb': an excruciating knife fight in which the victor soothes his dying opponent almost crucifies the audience with its grim denouement. Critics have harped on the unrelenting violence as pandering to a jaded, bloodthirsty audience, but they miss the point. Spielberg goes so far beyond the limits of typical cinematic 'Grand Guignol' that no one can mistake the overt nature of the message: killing people, especially ones that are trying to kill you, is a brutish, messy business, and no one in their right mind has any desire to engage in the trade any more than they might be otherwise compelled.After an opening 25-minute barrage that sets the tone, Spielberg and Rodat's story begins to unfold. Capt. John Miller (Tom 'Forrest Gump' Hanks) must lead a squad of his men through a highly fluid battle zone in search of a Private James Francis Ryan (Matt 'Good Will Hunting' Damon), the sole surviving brother of four. Ryan is somewhere behind enemy lines, a trooper of the scattered 101st Airborne Division, who had dropped the night before the invasion. It is D+3 and Miller has orders from General George Marshall to bring Ryan out of the raging Normandy battle, to be returned to the safety of his motherland and his family. And so we set off on a trek through hell, a journey that will leave most of its participants dead.Each man in the squad is an archetype, and a symbol. Pvt.Caparzo (Vin 'Pitch Black' Diesel) is Innocence, The Child. Wade, the medic (Giovanni 'SubUrbia' Ribisi), is Mercy, The Angel. Mellish, a Jewish soldier (Adam 'Dazed and Confused' Goldberg), and Jackson, the prayerful sharpshooter (Barry '61*' Pepper), embody twin motivations of Retribution and Righteousness, the Hammer and the Sword, while Sgt. Horvath (Tom 'Natural Born Killers' Sizemore) and Capt. Miller serve as Fortitude and Conscience, dual engines of strength and courage that keep the small patrol on its fated course.These are the ones who perish--each slain in ascending order of significance within the simple tapestry of the plot--the human qualities that are inevitably stripped from a man as he confronts the implacable juggernaut of war. The only ones to survive the charnelhouse are Pvt. Rieben (Ed 'The Brothers McMullen' Burns), the Witness, Chance ('I was born lucky, Captain!'), and tag-along interpreter Cpl. Upham (Jeremy 'Spanking the Monkey' Davies), the Everyman audience surrogate, the Fool. Ultimately, it is he who must make the crucial moral choice of the film.'Saving Private Ryan' is not a comfortable film experience. Overly sensitive film-goers will probably be overwhelmed by it; if they can make it through the Omaha beach sequence, they'll do okay. For the rest of us, it's a film worthy of the accolades it has so far received. Personally, I was a bit surprised that it didn't get the Oscar for Best Picture over 'Shakespeare in Love,' especially since Spielberg got the nod for Best Director. Such are the whims of the Academy. Never mind. It takes nothing away from the raw power of 'Saving Private Ryan.'Addendum: one noticeable difference between the theatrical and home video experience is visual. The stuttery, bleached-out quality of the film (primarily in the battle sequences) is much reduced in the transfer to small screen presentation. It's not a tremendous flaw, but moves me to definitely recommend a theatrical viewing should it ever present itself.",9,1,2,15 February 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Well done reboot of a dormant franchise...
","...that thankfully ignores the disappointing Tim Burton misfire in 2001 altogether, 'RotPotA' (now there's an acronym for you!) concentrates on setting the stage for what will hopefully be an inevitable sequel, i.e. a retooling of the original 'Planet of the Apes.' The husband/wife writing team of Rick 'Eye for...' Jaffa and Amanda '...an Eye' Silver keep their story tightly focused on the singular progenitor of an eventual race of intelligent apes, the aptly named Caesar (Andy 'I do motion-capture in my sleep' Serkis), never mind the human hand in all this, James 'I lost mine in 127 hours' Franco. Crisply directed by Rupert 'The Escapist' Wyatt, superbly lensed by Andrew 'The Lord of the Rings' Lesnie, and well scored by Patrick 'Henry V' Doyle, 'Rise...' dispenses with the nuclear option in favor of pandemic decimation of the human race to pave the way for simian domination in future installments, but as mentioned, this tale is about the ascension of Caesar and his cohorts, and that's all it needs to be, contrary to the opinion of at least one reviewer for whom I have high regard.I won't bore what few readers this blurb may have with yet another synopsis of what is pretty much an origins story (as the above mentioned reviewer duly noted), but will say that I was pleased by the plentiful references, veiled or otherwise, to the original Charlton Heston vehicle to which 'Rise...' owes everything. Personal favorite: a brief glimpse of the young Caesar building a Statue of Liberty model.Capsule sum-up: several entertaining hours at the movies. The motion-capture/CGI work is impressively well-staged and easy to follow, the acting is of a note, and the lead character, despite being unhuman in almost every respect, is captivating, compelling, and more than worthy of further attentions. If you don't leave the cinema with a sense of satisfaction and a desire to see the probable sequel, you're no 'Planet of the Apes' fan. Recommended.",7,1,2,8 August 2011
Cars," Looks like a Lexus...
","...rides like a Corolla.Which is not to say that 'Cars' is a bad movie; it isn't. On the surface, it's exceedingly slick. The CGI animation is superb, a genuine feast for the eyes. The rendering and detail are immaculate. The voice work by notables such as Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, George Carlin, Bonnie Hunt, Larry the Cable Guy, and John Ratzenberger is excellent. The computer camera-work is, well, thoroughly cinematic, if at times utterly impossible. The storytelling is pure Syd Fields, ably crafted, moving inexorably toward a crowd-pleasing, thematically satisfying finish.But there's something clunking under the hood, and all of John Lasseter and the late Joe Ranft's love of automobiles and the joys of nostalgic motoring can't hide the noise. Simply put, 'Cars' is the weakest product to roll off Pixar's assembly line so far.Why? It's hard to put one's finger on the problem, even once you get beyond the glossy surfaces. Part of the trouble is the storyline and themes. Egotistical overachiever learns the value of friendship and teamwork, along with some nostalgia for better days gone by. Nothing out of the ordinary there, I'd have to say, and other than the twist of having sentient vehicles doing the honors, eminently forgettable. In addition, 'Cars' seems perplexedly aimed at a somewhat older demographic than other Pixar films. There really aren't any characters a young child can identify with; 'Cars' is decidedly teen/adult fare, with the occasional bodily fluid or excrescence to palliate the juvenile need for fart jokes.Beyond that, the dramatic stakes are low. Lightning McQueen, Pixar's modern Speed Racer, is delayed from getting to his big race. When he makes it, will he win? Who cares? The audience has so little invested in McQueen that it really doesn't matter if the hotshot race car succeeds or not. In fact, his remarkable refusal to win the Piston Cup is so out of character as to be quite difficult to believe. Certainly no human driver in the world would have done what McQueen did, even in identical circumstances. The moral lesson of 'Cars' seems downright quaint in this instance, if not outright forced.Be that as it may, there's one further kink in the 'Cars' chassis that interests me, and that is its lack of direct connection to the world of humans. Every other Pixar film has it; 'Cars' doesn't. In fact, the only biological entities in the movie (not counting the flora) appear to be birds, and we see them so fleetingly that we really can't be sure they're not sentient flying machines like the tiny VW bugs. What I'm getting at is that 'Cars' seemingly begs the question of its own rationale: where did this civilization of sentient vehicles originate and how does it maintain itself? Did humans create this world and then vacate the premises, after some clever terraforming for the aesthetic pleasure of their creations? If the cars don't have passengers, why do they exist in the first place? Mack, the big rig that hauls around McQueen's trailer, gives us a slim hint with his line about 'thank the Manufacturer!' and Minny sighs, 'Oh, for the love of Chrysler!' but that's about it. There's also a reference to Jimi Hendrix, along with a soundtrack full of human music, but other than that, humans are non-existent in the film. It's almost maddening if you think about it too much, and perhaps I'm just spinning wheels of pointless speculation. Regardless, for me, it's a noticeable ding in the smooth perfection of the 'Cars' chassis.All this may sound like I didn't enjoy 'Cars,' but nothing could be further from the truth. I saw it on the big screen and had a great time, and finally picked it up on DVD as soon as it became 'last year's model.' To be honest, though, I'll be going back to that DVD more often for the two short features included on it: 'One Man Band,' a wonderful cartoon with all the hallmarks of 'classic' stamped all over its running time, and 'Mater and the Ghostlight,' a turnabout-is-fair-play romp starring the most memorable (and likable) 'Cars' character.'Cars' is definitely worth a watch unless you don't like animation, period, but I have doubts about its long-term mileage, despite the current high ratings here on the IMDb. 'Ratatouille' looks much better.",7,0,1,7 February 2007
Drive," A solid noir thriller...
","...from a mostly unknown (in the US) director, Nicolas Winding 'Valhalla Rising' Refn, 'Drive' features a terse adaptation of a James Sallis novel by Hossein 'Killshot' Amini, some deliciously stark and moody lensing by Newton Thomas 'The Usual Suspects' Sigel, a taut score from Cliff 'Sex, Lies & Videotape' Martinez (with immaculately chosen pop song accompaniment), and all the production and design atmosphere you could ask. Thanks to superb casting and Rejn's directorial abilities, 'Driver' presents a tight, simmering character-driven piece that periodically explodes in gory mayhem. Ryan 'The Notebook' Gosling deserves all the accolades he's been getting for his fully invested portrayal of the titular, laconic anti-hero, while the support from the likes of Carey 'Shame' Mulligan, Albert 'you have to ask?' Brooks, Ron 'you have to ask again?' Perlman, Bryan 'Breaking Bad' Cranston, Christina 'Mad Men' Hendricks, Oscar 'Robin Hood' Isaac, and even a cameo Russ 'West Side Story' Tamblyn provides a thoroughly realized foundation. 'Driver' has style and substance to spare; if I were to have any complaint, it might be about the somewhat melodramatic finale, which I refuse to spoil here.Rejn proves once and for all that he is a highly competent storyteller worth keeping an eye on. Gosling absolutely demonstrates his rising star power and the subtlety of his acting chops; this young man has a long, illustrious career ahead of him. 'Driver' is excellent work of savage noir entertainment, although not for the fainthearted, and perhaps not as great as its current IMDb rating might suggest (cult of the new rules here far too often), but very much worth catching. Highly recommended.",7,0,2,6 February 2012
2012," Emmerich nonsense at its finest...
","...or worst, depending on your sympathies, '2012' is a well-polished bolus of a film regardless. Its only genuine merit is spectacle, which it admittedly delivers in CGI spades. Earthquake? Check. Tidal waves? Check. Volcanic mayhem? Check. Avalanche? Check. Airplane crash? Check. Mayhem and mass destruction? Check, check, check, check. Aliens? Ch---oops, he left out the aliens. No death rays, sorry, Charlie.This is popcorn entertainment for the brain-dead masses, no question. H. L. Mencken must be laughing fit to kill. Emmerich crammed in every disaster movie cliché he could think of. Kids in peril, miraculously rescued? Check. Beloved pet, threatened and rescued? Check. Broken relationship magically healed? Check. Absurd pseudo-science and routine suspension of the laws of physics? Check. Stalwart supporting characters slaughtered with abandon? Check. Incredible coincidences, serendipities, and synchronicities? Check. Characters the audience really doesn't care about? Check. Attempts at humor more disastrous than the events depicted? Check. Actors taking paychecks? Check, please! Words fail me, as they did Emmerich. I really can't be bothered; nor was Emmerich. '2012' plays like it was plotted by a 10-year-old, and not a very bright one at that. Harold 'I can write words, too!' Klosar's score is formulaic in extremis, utterly forgettable. As I said, the only thing this wretched excess of a film can boast is its visuals. In fact, one might be best off wearing earplugs and watching the screen shenanigans in silence. This baby is as bad, if not worse, than everything Emmerich has done to date. The only scary and/or exciting thing about it is how much money it's going to make. What a sad commentary on the collective IQ and thoughtless tolerance of its intended audience, which is to say, us.Have I written enough yet? Check. Cue last reel coda. Roll credits.Edited to correct typo.",3,18,29,17 November 2009
The Number 23," The premise was intriguing...
","...and the execution was stylish, but even on second viewing, Joel 'Phone Booth' Schumacher's psychological thriller, 'The Number 23' didn't quite live up to its numerological promise. The script by newcomer Fernley Phillips mines the rich field of mystic numerology to set up an interesting mystery, but everything falls apart in a mundane third act wrap-up that negates everything that has come before, and leaves the audience scratching its collective head at the raft of 'oh, c'mons' and 'now hold on a seconds' with which Phillips & Schumacher leave them.Make no mistake, I really wanted to love this movie. I was a Robert Anton Wilson fan back in the day--the Illuminati trilogy, 'Principia Discordia,' the Church of the SubGenius, and all that other tongue-in-cheek hokum. I even had a casual 'obsession' with the number 23, though nothing like that of Walter Sparrow, the protagonist of this movie, played by Jim 'I Am Not Just a Comedian' Carey. Phillips' screenplay, though, clever as it is, just doesn't add up to much more than an overly spelled-out twist finale, very disappointing not only because of its relative mundanity, but because of its illogic.Still, the art direction, production design and so forth are all well done, very noir-ish in the 'fiction' scenes. Matthew 'Phone Booth' Libatique's camera wrangling is excellent, as is Harry 'Flushed Away' Gregson-Williams' music. The acting is decent, though I think Carey was not the best casting choice; his rubberface comedic persona seemed to be lurking just beneath the surface of what he was doing, and buying him as a sleazy detective (even a fictional one) with a hinky-dink for BDSM is quite a stretch. I have every respect for Carey as a dramatic actor (cf. 'Man on the Moon' and 'The Majestic' and even 'The Truman Show'), but the role simply called for someone with a bit more gravitas. Virgina 'Sideways' Madsen (whose 40th birthday was 9.11.2001---ooooh, spooky!) does fine as the wife, Logan '3:10 to Yuma' Lerman is serviceable as the son, Danny '30 Days of Night' Huston does the shrink thing, and the woefully under-appreciated character actor Mark 'Mulholland Drive' Pellegrino has a superb scene as the man at the apparent center of Sparrows' obsession. Also watch for a brief appearance by the great Ed 'Seabiscuit' Lauter, another great and mostly unlauded character actor. Oh, yes, Rhona 'Skinwalkers' Mitra is more than appealing as the sex object, even moreso in the unrated DVD director's cut.Ultimately, it's the collapse of logic that relegates 'The Number 23' to the status of 'just another movie, could have been great, but...' I'll not spoil anything for anyone reading this who might not have seen it yet, but suffice to say, you're going to finish up your filmwatching experience saying, 'Hey, wait a minute! That doesn't add up...'",6,1,3,16 December 2007
Ghost Rider," A film that makes you smell the sulphur of hell...
","...or is that just the stench of the film itself? Personally, I think the latter, but your mileage may vary. I was told by any number of friends and fellow film geeks that 'Ghost Rider' was a cut above the ordinary, and not to be judged on the basis of its writer/director's previous failures in the genre. Sorry, but they were wrong, and that's a big disappointment to me since I collected the comic book back when Mike Ploog kept it visually attractive.Make no mistake; 'Ghost Rider' is eminently attractive. Production values are as good as one might expect for a $100mil+ film, visuals included. DP Russell 'Picnic at Hanging Rock' Boyd works wonders with the camera; you'd hardly believe the western vistas and urban jungles he captures are Australian rather than Texan. But, unfortunately, Mark Steven 'Daredevil' Johnson's script plays out like the comic book story it apparently wants to be; the poor guy has yet to match his maiden effort, 'Grumpy Old Men.' The acting's not at fault, at least not overly so. Nicolas 'I've already got an Oscar' Cage is obviously too old to be playing a contemporary of Eva 'Hitch' Mendes, and Ms. Mendes is obviously no Oscar contender herself, but given the genre and Mr. Cage's apparent affection for the character, neither of the two outright embarrass themself, even though their younger selves seem more screenworthy. Likewise the supporting cast, comprised of lesser luminaries, is blameless, though unextraordinary. Sam 'Roadhouse' Elliott plays his typical grizzled character type that he can do in his sleep, while Peter 'Easy Rider' Fonda narrowly avoids camping up Cage's adversary, Mephistopheles--yes, ol' Scratch himself. Stan Lee passed on his typical cameo, which may or may not be indicative of his opinion of the film.Anyway, folks, once again it all comes down to the script, as it does in all films truly worth discussing (or not). Johnny Blaze just doesn't cut it as a superhero (maybe because he's not--he's a minion of hell, good intentions be damned). Worse, his opponents, having no real back story or screen presence, fail to impress; the 'Ghost Rider' deals with them all too easily. Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am, and that's how I felt about this film. In one eye and out the other. Next.",5,0,0,29 April 2008
The Mist," I'm not really sure what people were expecting...
","...from a screen version of Stephen King's downbeat novella, 'The Mist,' but I'm here to tell you that writer/director Frank Darabont doesn't wander very far from the fold of King's vicious little horror. There's going to be plenty of argument about Darabont's altered ending, that's for sure, but the rest of the adaptation is pretty much faithful to the original tale. Expiation, indeed.'The Mist' is not going to be a popular piece of entertainment like 'The Green Mile' or 'The Shawshank Redemption.' It's a flat-out nasty horror movie, very similar in spirit (and substance) to George A. Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead' and that classic's many cousins and numerous antecedents. It will suffer from not being released when it should have been (can you say Halloween? I knew you could...), although I suspect it'll do reasonably well on home video in the midst of wintry desolation. It's just not what one would call a reaffirming film, and sure as heck isn't joyous holiday fare.The plot line is slim, as it was in the novella: a group of Maine townspeople are trapped in a grocery store by a preternatural mist within which lurk all manner of otherworldly creatures inimical toward humanity. Our hero, Thomas 'The Punisher' Jane, heads a capable cast that includes Marcia Gay 'Mystic River' Harden religiously chewing scenery with fine Piper Laurie/Ellen Burstyn enthusiasm, Laurie 'Silent Hill' Holden suitably vulnerable as the terrified-but-resilient surrogate wife, Nathan 'Babel' Gamble equally vulnerable as the terrified-but-not-quite-as-resilient son, along with a host of capable character actors, including William 'Trespass' Sadler, Toby 'Infamous' Jones, Frances 'Cheers' Sternhagen, Alexa 'The Chronicles of Riddick' Davalos, Chris 'American Pie' Owen, David 'The Reaping' Jensen, and Sam 'Battlestar Galactica' Witwer, whose main purpose is, by and large, to serve up nice, gruesome helpings of monster mash, steaming fresh.Darabont's script is tight, almost overly so, excising much of the novella's build-up to disaster, despite the two-hour running time, and as mentioned, fairly faithful to the source material, ending notwithstanding. 'The Mist' has a strong documentary feel to it, due to TV veteran DP Ronn 'Huff' Schmidt's roving lensmanship and Hunter M. 'I got my start with Darren Lynn Bousman!' Via's concise editing; Darabont's prudent sculpting of King's pessimistic-yet-hopeful study of ordinary human beings under extraordinary pressure keeps things moving along to the inevitable heartbreaking climax.I say inevitable because my intuitive opinion is that King's original ending wouldn't have worked cinematically; audiences would have screamed for a more concrete resolution. Darabont's grim finale is right out of the Romero playbook, the one he copied from the ancient tragedies, and drives a deeper nail than King did with his ambiguous fade-out. I suspect King realized as much himself when he publicly favored Darabont's change. The message is still the same: stick together and don't give up hope. Darabont simply offers a pointed reminder of what can happen when hope is lost.The fx work by CafeFX (along with make-up fx from the ubiquitous KNB Effects Group) is mostly excellent, although in retrospect, I would have liked to have seen a little less of the behemoth monster. Some things really are just better left...indistinct. Visual nods to John Carpenter's 'The Thing,' King's own serial masterwork, 'The Dark Tower,' and Mike Mignola's 'Hellboy' will please devoted fanboys, but this is definitely not one for the kiddies, folks, unless you're that brand of monstrous parent that likes to traumatize their brood to 'toughen them up.' KNB and CafeFX serve up plenty of grue, including a horrendous mutant insect sting, some nasty burns, flesh-ripping tentacles, acidic spiders, the odd stabbing, shooting, and garroting, a Lovecraftian crab monster that somehow made me think of 'Starship Troopers,' and a suitable variety of other creepy-crawlies guaranteed to give children nightmares and make young girls cuddle up to their dates for reassurance.In a nutshell: decently done adaptation of one of King's more straightforward yarns, but nowhere near as memorable (except for that gut punch finish) as Darabont's other King retellings.(this review slightly edited after second viewing 11.24.07)",7,2,7,21 November 2007
I Am Legend," An interesting update of 'The Omega Man'...
","...which is to say, 'I Am Legend' no more hews to the Richard Matheson novel on which it's based than its early 70s predecessor did, beyond the basic premise of the last man on earth trying to survive the aftermath of a catastrophic plague to which he is immune while doggedly attempting to find a cure, but this Will Smith vehicle offers much to satisfy an audience jaded by cinematic visions of apocalypse. Director Francis 'Constantine' Lawrence presents a fully realized urban wasteland of near-future New York City, thanks to superb art direction, production design & set decoration (much of it provided by the core design talents of 'Constantine') and flawless camera work by Andrew 'King Kong/LotR' Lesnie. In that respect, 'I Am Legend' is a marvel to behold. Likewise, Smith's performance as Robert Neville is a quantum step above his typical characterizations, and an equal pleasure to watch. Who'da thunk this desolate, beleaguered man was once the fresh prince of anything?Less pleasurable, though, is the story (although changing the dog to a faithful companion and link to the past was a strong plus), which overlooks most of the psychological/philosophical concerns of the novel, in favor of raw survivalism and blockbuster-style action, primarily in the third act. Writers Mark 'Poseidon' Protosevich and Akiva 'The DaVinci Code' Goldsman (who also produced) have again removed the vampirism from Neville's antagonists. This time around, the plague survivors are psychotic mutants, incapable of speech, eliminating all subtlety of interplay between Neville and his opposition. Conflict is reduced to kill or be killed, without a hint of negotiation, very much a page torn from the '28 Days Later...' playbook. I'll not spoil the ending, other than to mention that Protosevich and Goldsman turn the meaning of the title on its head, a complete reversal from the novel. If purists thought the ending of Frank Darabont's 'The Mist' was sacrilege, fans of Matheson's novel have it even worse.As of this writing, 'I Am Legend' is sporting a ridiculous 70% '10' rating here on the IMDb, which will undoubtedly sink like a rock once Joe Sixpack weighs in. It'll be interesting to see just how fast that descent occurs. The opening-day midnight crowd I saw the film with seemed to enjoy themselves, but there was no applause when it ended. 'I Am Legend' isn't the travesty that 'I, Robot' was, but I suspect that Will Smith ought to avoid headlining movies that start with 'I...'",6,1,3,14 December 2007
Unknown," Destined to remain so...
","...or at the least rarely watched, this faux-Hitchcockian thriller helmed by Jaume 'House of Wax' Collet-Sera, with a script by two writers of no renown from a novel by an author of somewhat greater reputation, simply cannot transcend the weakness of its premise or the flimsiness of its characters. Act One trades on contemporary fears of identity theft, Act Two sends our hero and his gal sidekick (Diane 'Inglorious Basterds' Kruger) in search of answers, and Act Three unleashes a trick ending that fairly well beggars the imagination as well as all credulity. Leading man Liam 'all kinds of movies' Neeson does what he can with the material, but none of it stretches his chops, and all sorts of other name actors take their paychecks as well, with the only genuine standout being Bruno 'Downfall' Ganz as an ex-Stasi agent conveniently brought into the nonsensical fray. All in all, it's mindless entertainment of a very pedestrian sort, and makes me think that Collet-Sera's upcoming live-action version of 'Akira' will be a disappointment. Next time, Liam, don't forget your suitcase, eh?",5,3,4,26 November 2011
Patton," Despite George C. Scott's bravura performance...
","...as the titular character, 'Patton' has not really worn all that well over the years, and I say that as someone who saw the film in the theater back in the day (and loved it), and a good number of times thereafter on VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD. I re-watched it recently, was more than disappointed that it didn't measure up to memory, and have downgraded my rating of it accordingly. It's a good film, mind you, superior to many of its kind, but when Scott's not on screen, 'Patton' is just another WWII movie suffering the usual after-the-fact inaccuracies. Never mind the use of anachronistic tanks and other equipment, or the simplistic and inaccurate portrayal of engagements like the Battle of El Guettar, the film simply stalls whenever Patton himself isn't the focus. The pacing is often slow, and truthfully, a half-hour or more could have been cut without significant loss of content. Despite a solid performance from Karl 'The Streets of San Francisco' Malden, too much time is spent on General Omar Bradley; for instance, the entire opening sequence (post-Patton monologue) at Kasserine Pass is, in my mind, superfluous.Nonetheless, a very good bio-film, and required viewing for Scott admirers, as well as students of the zeitgeist of a divided Vietnam War era United States. That 'Patton' was President Nixon's self-admitted favorite film shortly before he commenced the secret and then not-so-secret war on Cambodia is food enough for thought.",7,1,2,26 January 2012
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Award-winning socio-political drama...
","...probably deserved a few of the prizes it didn't win as well, but remains a fine piece of work nonetheless. Actor/director/co-writer George 'Return of the Killer Tomatoes' Clooney guides his perfectly cast lead, David 'Return of the Secaucus Seven' Strathairn, to a fully realized portrayal of one of America's great journalist/commentators, and brings the story of CBS-TV's pivotal struggle to weather the political tide of McCarthyism to vivid b & w life. Immaculately shot by Robert 'There Will Be Blood' Elswit, and edited by Stephen 'Babel' Mirrione, with superb production design by James D. '300' Bissell, and art direction by Christa 'The Ring Two' Munro, 'Good Night, and Good Luck' plunks its audience smack in the middle of Cold War paranoia and the ever present struggle between freedom and oppression, a struggle that unsurprisingly seems all too familiar more than half century after the fact. Clooney and co-writer Grant Heslov's cautionary screenplay gives the media, the government, and corporate business their biggest collective poke in the eye since 'Network' pointed out the Emperor's lack of clothing in 1976. Required viewing for anyone interested in the free expression of ideas, as well as the dangers of corporate media and the intrusions of government upon individual rights.",8,3,4,12 February 2008
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Well-meaning but dubiously probable...
","...and very, very O. Henry-esquire tale of innocence paying a blood debt for incalculable evil, 'The Boy in the Striped Pajamas' is nonetheless a minor Holocaust film worth at least a viewing. Adapted for film and helmed by British director, Mark 'Brassed Off' Herman, from an Irish novel for young adults, 'The Boy...' tells the story of a stunningly naive German boy, Bruno, who befriends a Jewish peer, an inmate of the concentration camp run by Bruno's father, an SS officer. Themes of trust, friendship, and willing complicity in evil doings are explored as things move toward a somewhat telegraphed and highly unlikely conclusion.Beyond nicely realized performances by the 'name' actors headlining the cast--Vera 'The Orphan' Farmiga, David 'Harry Potter and...' Thewlis, and Rupert 'The Young Victoria' Friend--the real leads, children both, are quite effective, which is good, because the success of the film truly rests on their chemistry. Asa 'Son of Rambow' Butterfield and newcomer Jack Scanlon draw the viewer into their unusual relationship and tragic adventure with effortless grace; they could both well be young actors worth keeping tabs on. No, there's no complaint in the acting, nor in most of the relatively low-budget production values. Shot in Hungary, 'The Boy...' manages a nice period veneer on an otherwise most improbable dramatic hook, line, and sinker. The film suffers from plotting anomalies and some far-fetched dramatic assumptions.I'll be blunt: the young son of an SS officer in WWII Germany simply could not have been as sheltered and ingenuous as the film's protagonist; it beggars willing suspension of disbelief, or at least it does mine. And the scenario of two little boys on opposite sides of a barbed wire fence surrounding a concentration camp, though emotionally and visually arresting, borders on the definition of preposterous. Perhaps this is all explained away in the source novel; perhaps not. The film makes no attempt, and perhaps purposefully so. For me, it didn't work.As I said, though, still worth a watch if you're in the mood for that sort of overt manipulation. The ending is almost 'Twilight Zone'-ish in its melodramatic tragedy, and left this viewer feeling that he'd been cheated of a resolution more in keeping with the prior tone and perspective of the story.",6,0,1,2 January 2010
Evil Dead," It's official: I have matured...
","...to the point where a gore-fest like this reset of 'The Evil Dead' series failed to impress me. Sadly, mindless Grand Guignol appears to be still popular, and the profit margin of this one will undoubtedly spawn a sequel. More's the pity. Truthfully, the ensemble acting from a quintet of relative unknowns is passable, the DP work from Kiwi Aaron 'Spartacus: War of the Damned' Morton is quite nice, and certainly the goo and gristle are up to snuff (been looking for a place to stick that pun for awhile), but unfortunately it's all in the service of tyro auteur Fede 'Yes, my first feature film!' Alvarez' pedestrian script and workmanlike-at-best direction. Others are apparently also to blame for the script, including Diablo 'Juno' Cody, and likely should be held equally responsible---small recompense to the viewer, though.After a pointless prologue that could have easily been dealt with in a one-minute flashback, the story (such as it is) settles into an uninspiring realm of hack work, providing nothing in the way of interesting characters to latch onto and even less in the way of surprises, tension and---most important---scares. The film's tagline is sad example of hyperbole and hubris; the only thing terrifying about this misfire is that so many people fell for the hype, and now we'll have to put up with another one down the line. Gone are virtually any traces of what made Raimi's original film memorable, mostly a sense of humor and the spark of genuine imagination. Alvarez' 'Evil Dead' is deadly serious and deadly intent on making money from an indiscriminate audience, which renders it deadly dull.Let's put it this way: when several of the main characters purportedly wait 'all morning' for the rest of their party to arrive at a remote cabin without any of them bothering to check and see if they can actually get in the place, only to discover upon that arrival that the door has already been breached by forced entry...well, you know as an audience that your intelligence and willful suspension of disbelief are not going to be respected, and that all the homages and references to the original film aren't going to make a bit of difference.I shudder to think what sort of self-congratulatory extras are going to be in the BluRay/DVD release. They're certainly going to be more entertaining (but not in a good way) than this hapless remake of a classic lo-fi horror movie that should have been left alone.8.27.13 edit: Against my better judgment, I revisited this one on DVD (okay, fine, it was from the library, shoot me) and stand by everything I said above. Thankfully, the three promo featurettes were not, as I had feared, overly self-congratulatory, and actually left me feeling a little more charitable toward the writer/director and his leading lady, but none of them altered my opinion of the film itself. 'Evil Dead' is make-work, Sturgeon's Revelation all the way.",4,33,61,31 May 2013
World Trade Center," Stone eschews the political for a powerful human drama
","Those who say the American people aren't ready for a '9/11' movie are, in my mind, either simply wrong, or perhaps overly committed to some sort of epiphany they may have experienced in the aftermath of the WTC attack half a decade ago. Five years is a long time, certainly more than enough to get over the 'shock and awe' that was unleashed by Islamic terrorists upon the American mainland. Perhaps it has to do with a perceived failure to exact revenge, a lack of closure to the experience via righteous retaliation. Perhaps unconsciously we're aware that the temporary disruption of the Taliban in Afghanistan and the invasion of Iraq have not given us that relief, certainly not in any tangible way, and has in fact possibly contributed to an increased animosity in the world toward the United States and a worsening of the always volatile situation in the Middle East.The truth is, though, that Oliver Stone's 'World Trade Center' isn't about the attack per se. It's about the indomitability of the human spirit and its will to survive. It's a disaster movie set in the rubble of two gigantic towers that collapsed.Stone fans (and haters) will be taken aback as they realize that 'World Trade Center' is NOT a typical Oliver Stone film. There are no conspiracy theories contained within. There's very little in the way of quirky film technique or over-the-top acting or splintered storytelling. There's no anti-establishment rhetoric or sentiment. In fact, 'World Trade Center' goes out of its way to avoid these very things.What you will get is a well-crafted story scripted by a relative newcomer, Andrea Berloff, concerning the fate of two New York Port Authority policemen, John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Peña), who were trapped under the ruins of the two towers. Their claustrophobic dilemma is juxtaposed against the effects of this misfortune upon their respective families and the efforts of the selfless many who labored to rescue them. That these two men actually lived through the collapse was miraculous in and of itself; that they survived long enough to be rescued beggars the imagination, especially when you consider that they were essentially found via sheer serendipity in the form of a driven ex-Marine (played with perhaps too much iconic resolve and fortitude by Michael Shannon) randomly searching through the rubble for survivors.Some will not be satisfied with Stone and Berloff's effort to put a dramatic human face on the horrific events of September 11, 2001. Some will resent the inherent profit motive of film-making. Some will simply not wish to be reminded of that dark day, ostrich-like as that may be. I have no easy answer for any of them, other than to remind them that they are free to not see the film. There are still many of us who are not afraid to relive the emotional experiences we underwent five years ago, who are willing to engage ourselves in the catharsis that this film provides. It's a part of the healing process, and as far as I'm concerned, something like that can never start 'too soon.' At any rate, 'World Trade Center' cannot be faulted on any significant technical grounds. The acting is faultless, with the possible exception of Cage's NY accent, which really didn't bother me all that much; all four of the leads--including the always impressive Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal as the distraught wives--fully deserve award nominations. Seamus McGarvey's cinematography is superb, the production design, art design, costuming, and so on are uniformly excellent; one feels as if they're right there at the scene. Craig Armstrong's music is at times heavy-handed, but invariably serves its purpose. The sound design is particularly effective, especially when the towers collapse; if that doesn't generate an Oscar nomination at the very least, I don't know what will. Most pointedly, this is a film that, despite its horrific subject matter, manages to effectively illustrate a characteristic of human beings that belies the baser motives of the perpetrators of the attack: we have the ability to band together to surmount our difficulties, no matter how horrendous, and come out on top, unbowed, ready to move on against all odds. I find it hard to knock a movie that will tell me that, and do it with a relative minimum of schmaltz. Say what you will about Stone 'selling out' or compromising his reputation and values, 'World Trade Center' is a powerful piece of film-making that, in my opinion, ought to be seen by everyone with the emotional strength to watch it.1/19/07 addendum: Having recently seen and reviewed 'United 93,' I thought it worthwhile to return here. I note with interest that IMDb'ers gave 'World Trade Center' a much lower percentage of '10' ratings, though still a healthy 19.4%, as well as a significant '1' rating of 11%, which I attribute to A) a strong anti-Stone sentiment, and B) unfair comparison to relatively undramatic, documentary style of 'United 93.' Also interesting is the cumulative '7.6' from 204 under-18 females, the highest rating cohort apart from the IMDb staff. One could probably write a thesis on the whys and wherefores of such voting.I'm also amused to see that only one reader (so far) has found my comments to be 'useful.' I can only wonder how much this reflects a dislike of my politics as revealed, and how much it reveals the possible poverty of my writing. Another thesis, anyone?",8,2,10,12 August 2006
Black Snake Moan," Another gem from auteur Craig Brewer...
","...'Black Snake Moan' reunites the creative team from Brewer's previous effort, 'Hustle & Flow,' with even stronger results. DP Amy 'This Film Is Not Yet Rated' Vincent, editor Billy 'Band of Brothers' Fox, composer Scott 'Teenage Tupelo' Bomar, Production Designer Keith Brian '2 Fast 2 Furious' Burns, and others all kick in to craft the second part of what Brewer intends to be a pentalogy (quintology/quintuplet?) of Memphis-based stories, each rooted in a different musical genre. 'Hustle & Flow' was the rap movie; 'Black Snake Moan' is the blues film.And a fine film it is. Do not be fooled by the ill-conceived trailer or the deceptive posters; 'Black Snake Moan' is not an exploitation film in the normal sense of the term. It's a tale of redemption and love, a bit of a modern fable, if you will. Certainly it features exploitative elements (tough to avoid when your female lead is running around barely dressed for significant amounts of time), but the story transcends those elements with an honest humanity that one rarely, if ever, finds in a true exploitation flick. Samuel L. 'My resume speaks for itself' Jackson turns in yet another finely nuanced performance (including, for this writer, some pleasantly unexpected musicianship), and Christina 'Mine, too' Ricci shines equally brightly. The mostly unknown support cast is also very effective, even its 'name' component, Justin '*NYSNC' Timberlake. None of this would have been possible without Brewer's excellent screenplay, of course, nor his sure direction. I'll definitely be looking forward to the next three films up Brewer's creative sleeve.A recap of the plot would be pointless here, other than to make this a complete review. Suffice it to say, a broken-hearted, God-fearing rustic takes it upon himself to save a young, white trash lost soul from herself, and in the process heals himself as well. I'll leave it to the random reader of this review to see how things play out. I assure you, they play out well. 'Black Snake Moan' is a very human, very moving story, easily worth the two hours it will take to watch it. Highly recommended; you won't regret it.Addendum trivia question: without looking it up, which actor in 'Black Snake Moan' played a small (but not insignificant) role in 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day?' I'm betting that 99 out of 100 of you won't get it without cheating.",8,2,5,5 March 2008
The Dark Knight," Move over 'Iron Man,' superhero movies have a new champion...
","...and franchise sequels have a potential new king as well. Writer/director Christopher 'Memento' Nolan, in concert with brother Jonathan 'The Prestige' Nolan and David S. 'Jumper' Goyer, has crafted a powerful script for the Batman this time around, one that gives the caped crusader plenty of existential questions to ponder, as well as two superbly (and perhaps definitively) refurbished arch villains to battle. Fanboys are currently beside themselves with joy, and the general movie-going demographic has responded in droves to enjoy this midsummer night's dream. Kudos to all involved.If nothing else, 'The Dark Knight' enshrines Heath 'Clowning Around' Ledger's swansong performance as Joker. It's a portrayal of anarchic evil that fascinates and repels, and ought surely draw a posthumous Oscar nomination. The man assuredly went out on a high note. The rest of the acting is nearly as strong: Christian 'American Psycho' Bale wears the Batman cowl with grim authority, Aaron 'Thank You For Smoking' Eckhart perfectly limns the transformation of white knight district attorney, Harvey Dent, to dark avenger, Two-Face. Maggie 'Secretary' Gyllenhaal as the third side of the love triangle with Dent and Bruce Wayne makes one instantly forget Katie Holmes in 'Batman Begins.' Gary 'Sid and Nancy' Oldman is rock solid as Lt.-soon-to-be-Commissioner Gordon, Batman's police ally, while the rest of the ensemble turns in equally assured performances. Truly, only a determined curmudgeon could fault the acting in 'The Dark Knight.' Production values are equally impressive. Nolan's mainstay DP, Wally 'Memento' Pfister captures the director's vision perfectly, Lee 'The Truman Show' Smith, another Nolan collaborator, edits with fine control of pace and comprehensibility, and consummate composers Hans 'Batman Begins' Zimmer and James Newton 'King Kong' Howard craft a strong, schizophrenically evocative score. The production design, art direction, costuming, and set decoration are all letter-perfect; the audience is totally and immediately immersed in the dark realities of Gotham 'No, it's New York!' City, and briefly, the glittering beauty of Hong Kong. The superb visual and special effects are the icing on a film in which every dollar was obviously well-spent.Now, all that said, 'The Dark Knight' is not without faults, keeping me from giving it a full '10' vote. It's a tad long (the brief sub-plot with The Scarecrow could have been easily axed, for instance), though not unbearably so. Eckhart's Two-Face make-up is impeccable but just too over-the-top for me to accept; how does an eyeball even survive the burns that ruined his face so dramatically? Additionally, the usual action movie defiance of physics and human physiology belies Nolan's attempt to otherwise ground his story in reality. There are questions of how The Joker can reasonably set-up such elaborate traps, let alone manage to successfully hire the legion of goons who so willingly carry out his homicidal, and all too often back-stabbing, plans.Still, these are relatively minor flaws in an otherwise fully-realized and complex tale of conflicted good versus unmitigated evil. The parallels drawn to current difficulties with international terrorism are quite evident, both thematically and visually. The answers provided to difficult ethical dilemmas are appropriately incomplete; there is no cheap closure provided for the Batman's angst, nor easy answers to Joker's psychosis. The Nolans have elevated run-of-the-mill comic book pop psychology much closer to rarefied levels of myth and legend. If another episode of the revitalized Batman franchise gets green-lighted, the challenge of topping this entry will be extraordinary. I, for one, will look forward to it.'The Dark Knight' may have a limited appeal to an older demographic (current IMDb voting shows the 45+ cohort more than a full point beneath the weighted average), but the quality of film-making should draw a lot of these folks in when the DVD is released. I'm also amused that a full three percent of IMDb voters tagged this with a '1'. Are they blind, willfully stupid, or just paid confederates of Joker? 'The Dark Knight' is an adrenaline-fueled rocket of a movie that manages to avoid catering to LCD sensibilities and leaves its audience with plenty to think and talk about, more so than any other superhero movie so far, and if nothing else, will stand as permanent testament to the acting chops of Heath Ledger. For that alone, it's worth seeing.(Very slightly edited 8.05.08 after second viewing)",9,5,11,25 July 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," Despite the passage of nearly four decades...
","...Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' (hereafter '2001') remains benchmark cinematic science fiction of the highest order. No serious cinemaphile can deny the majesty and beauty of this film, nor can they deny its unique position in cinema history. Much like earlier films such as 'King Kong,' the Kubrick masterwork ushered in a new age of film-making that paved the way not only for the giddy, fantastical, and profitable excitement of 'Star Wars' (1977), a groundbreaker in its own right, but also an entire wave of 'smart' films of speculative fiction, especially those involving machine intelligence. Think 'Silent Running' and 'Colossus: The Forbin Project,' 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner' and 'The Terminator,' etal, right down to recent films like 'AI' and 'I, Robot' (which is admittedly based on an Asimov tale that pre-dates '2001,' but never mind). All seem hardly possible without the trailblazing of '2001.' All owe an inestimable debt to Kubrick's vision.It's most peculiar writing about a film I've seen more than twenty times in a movie theater, including several times on a Cinerama screen, and uncounted times on VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD. I almost feel as if I know it so well that there's nothing left to say about it, and perhaps there's not a lot I can add to the reams of reviews posted here on the IMDb and elsewhere. Still, the film has been a favorite of mine ever since I first saw it over 35 years ago, so it deserves at least a mention in my IMDb comments folder, right? Right.The impeccable Geoffrey Unsworth cinematography, the razor perfect editing of Ray Lovejoy, the immaculate production design, art direction, even the costuming; all illuminate the unmistakable vision of director/producer/co-writer Stanley Kubrick, one of the undeniable masters of film direction. More, '2001' is very much a piece of the Sixties/Seventies zeitgeist, an indelible cultural meme that spoke to the deepest yearnings and loftiest ambitions of those idealistic and turbulent years. The film's only real flaws now are the unavoidable anachronisms and its ambitious calendar of interplanetary travel. PanAm went belly up along with Bell, and it's a good five years since that mundane tic of the Gregorian calendar (millennial ignorance notwithstanding) and we're still a long way from Mars, let alone Jupiter and The Beyond. But '2001' still exerts the same power, still evokes the same sense of awe at the mystery and majesty of the universe, as well as our place within it.The film tells a fairly simple story in a somewhat oblique fashion: Humanity, nudged by an alien artifact, discovers tools, or more specifically weapons, and in the blink of one of the most famous jump cuts in cinematic history, masters technology, which leads inevitably to an alien beacon planted beneath the surface of Luna. What comes after, in a third act so lengthy it begins before intermission, is the true meat of Kubrick and Clarke's story, and the welcome introduction of one of the most compelling and thought-provoking cinematic villains ever created: the HAL9000 computer.I could fill out the rest of this commentary just talking about HAL, but will spare the wandering eye. Suffice to say, imnsho, HAL is the true protagonist of Act Three (HAL's tragic error of pride leads to his own destruction), but already I digress...Kubrick's film works so beautifully because he prompts his audience to think for itself, and does it primarily without words. Not to spite Clarke's simultaneously-written novel, which is worthy science fiction in its own right, but Kubrick's command of cinematic storytelling connects on a much more visceral, indelible level, deftly showing rather than telling. A thousand words of prose could not match the grandeur of 'The Blue Danube' wedded to the intricate beauty of a shuttle docking with an orbital space station, or communicate the inherent humor of a man contemplating a zero-gravity toilet, nor could they match the psychedelically effective rendition of interstellar transport at the act's climax. Hard-nosed realists might argue that the provocative ending to Clarke's novel ('...but he would think of something.') is more satisfying than Kubrick's somewhat baroque and mystic one, but the message is clear: Man has risen above his darker nature (personified by HAL, and also Moon-Walker, the two characters who commit murder) and been transformed. Into what? Well, that's for you to decide.'2001: A Space Odyssey' is without question a film that demands to be seen on the big screen, the bigger the better. I can't recommend viewing it that way highly enough, though I imagine most anyone reading this will have slim opportunity to do so again until it enjoys an anniversary theatrical re-release of one denomination or another. A nice 40th sounds good to me!Edit: Okay, at this point (4.17.11), I'll settle for a 50th anniversary viewing.",10,13,27,19 July 2006
Avatar," So, now that it's on the home video market...
","...I'll burn a few words on James 'I'm king of the world' Cameron's latest epic sfx extravaganza. I'll not bother the reader with a recitation of the formulaic plot (which has been parsed to death here on the IMDb and elsewhere) and stereotypical characters (all of which conform to standard Campbellian norms), but rather will expound a bit on a comparison of the 3D theatrical and the 2D home video experiences.Simply put, 'Avatar' is a big-screen 3D event; the 2D home version, though beautiful, in no way matches the theatrical experience. My observation is that reducing the size of the image and flattening it only emphasizes the CGI, turning 'Avatar' into more of an animated feature than it already is. The work is still pretty much seamless, and extremely effective, but there's something about the diminishment of the screen and the loss of depth that brings out the artificial nature of the visuals, particularly in some of the movements of the Na'vi (which looked absolutely fine on the big screen, btw). I've noticed this effect before in a number of CGI-fests, including Peter Jackson's remake of 'King Kong' and his 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. Even Mauro 'The Kingdom' Fiore's fluid DP work and Cameron, etal's editing can't completely conceal the artifice underpinning the sumptuous, downright brilliant art and production design (shades of Roger Dean, for certain). 'Avatar' absolutely depends on 3D presentation to adequately disguise the current limitations of CGI.Beyond that, it's a fine popcorn movie with absolutely no surprises beyond the visual. I admire Cameron for having done it; now please do something with a little more substance to it, ala 'The Abyss.'3/1/11 edit: Caught up to the 3-disc DVD presentation with the various deleted scenes (most of which were extraneous and excised for good reason), as well as a fascinating 'making-of' documentary which I highly recommend. I'm actually looking forward to Cameron's 3D retrofitting of 'Titanic' now. I love watching that ship sink.2.27.13 edit: Finally caught this on 3D HDTV and was impressed. The 3D was excellent, reaffirming its value opposed to 2D presentation.",9,1,3,26 June 2010
Grindhouse," Homage to the cheapie-quickies works for the most part...
","...but something tells me that after opening weekend, 'Grindhouse' is going to trail off fast and end up only being the cult movie it wants to be with the fan base it aims at for the brain shot. General audiences will steer clear once they've realized how high the geek factor is in this splatter-fest of a tribute to the sort of garbage many of us enjoyed back in the 60s and 70s. More's the pity that 'Grindhouse' won't get all that much exposure in that most suitable of venues: the drive-in. Maybe it'll hit that circuit this summer, maybe not.No matter. If you're a fan of the genre that Quentin 'I'm so famous you only have to say my given name' Tarantino and Robert 'El Mariachi' Rodriguez lovingly both reproduce and subtly mock, then 'Grindhouse' is a must-see. It has pretty much everything you could want or expect in an exploitation flick: beautiful women, car chases, car crashes, zombies, Grand Guignol humor, plot lapses, grainy film stock and scratchy prints, outrageous splatter fx, 'prevues of coming attractions', a scattering of cult actors and a soundtrack worth listening to. You can't go wrong with that, no way.'Grindhouse' is a double-feature action/horror extravaganza, replete with bogus trailers by the likes of Rob 'The Devil's Rejects' Zombie, Eli 'Hostel' Roth, and Edgar 'Shaun of the Dead' Wright. Rodriguez handles the writing, directing, and lensing chores for both the opening fake trailer ('Machete,' starring Rodriguez' ubiquitous cousin, Danny 'Runaway Train' Trejo, who I'm sorry to say is beginning to look every bit of his age) as well as the first feature, 'Planet Terror,' a no-holds-barred send-up of every two-bit zombie movie you've ever seen. Tarantino weighs in with 'Death Proof,' a vengeance flick full of adrenalized car stunts that even features a real-life stuntwoman as one of the leads, along with his trademark ration of tangential chatter written in multi-clause mouthfuls. Rodriguez' half comes off a little more entertaining, although Tarantino's finishes with a better bang. I left the theater pretty much sated, although I'll agree with other commentators that more nudity would have been truer to the genre.Within the context of what two very popular auteurs have tried to achieve, 'Grindhouse' offers little to criticize, but if you're not a fan of the genre, there will also be little for you to enjoy. Me, I had a great time, and can't wait for what I trust will be an extras-packed DVD down the road.Second-viewing addendum (revised): I'm rather irked at the DVD release schedule for the film. It's now split into two movies, each being an extended version. I've picked up 'Death Proof,' and although I enjoyed the various extra features immensely (Zoe Bell, will you marry me?), I thought the film was better in its short version presented in 'Grindhouse.' Tarantino was wise to cut his scenes out of the theatrical release, along with other extraneous bits. Now, if only Rodriguez had been smart enough to cut Tarantino out of 'Planet Terror'... Of course, as always, your mileage may vary.",7,2,6,7 April 2007
Sinister," Perhaps mistitled, but still effective...
","...this third full-length outing from writer/director Scott 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' Derrickson squeezes great value out of its relatively minuscule budget (and was certainly a success at the box office, earning more than fifteen times its production costs!), thanks to a relatively tight script, solid ensemble acting (including fine work by Ethan 'Tape' Hawke---ignore the naysayers), effective sound design and equally effective cinematography by Chris 'Trumbo' Norr. I won't belabor the plot---others have done that already---but if you let yourself go with the flow, the ride is satisfyingly creepy. 'Sinister' isn't really a scare-fest; there aren't a whole lot of 'Boo!' moments, but it accomplishes its goal of unsettling you, and leaves you with a distinct interest in a sequel, if only to find out if anyone can deal with 'Mr. Boogie.'I caught this for free, thanks to my public library, but I think if I'd sprung for it in the theater, I wouldn't have felt ripped off. Despite his having been saddled with the disappointing remake of 'The Day The Earth Stood Still,' Derrickson bounced back nicely with this one, and I look forward to his future endeavors, particularly his remake of 'Poltergeist' and an adaptation of George Alec Effinger's cyberpunk novel, 'When Gravity Fails.'This Derrickson guy is a director to keep an eye on; I predict great things for him in the future.",7,1,2,18 April 2013
The Great Raid," Well done if not overly-involving drama...
","...that sparked my interest in researching a little-known rescue action that was a small but significant part of the WWII campaign to retake the Philippine Islands from Imperial Japan. I'll definitely be on the lookout for the books, 'Ghost Soldiers,' and 'The Great Raid on Cabanatuan,' from which the screenplay has been drawn. As others have mentioned, 'The Great Raid' is no 'Saving Private Ryan,' but it treads a lot of the same ground in a different theater of that same terrible conflict, and does so quite effectively.To digress just a moment, I'm intrigued by the unusually high ratings given this film by female IMDb voters, particularly those under 18 and over 45. I can only guess that a large number of these ladies are Filipinas supporting a film that does such a nice job of depicting the bravery and dedication of the Filipino underground resistance in their cooperative efforts with their American liberators.Digressing further, I lived in the P.I. for a number of years as a young teenager. The experience gained me an international outlook that most Americans do not have. I was very pleased to see that 'The Great Raid' gave the locals their due, refusing to lower itself to typical overwrought Hollywood 'patriotism.' In these paranoid and parochial post-9/11 days, that is extremely refreshing.Director John Dahl is probably best known for the Matt Damon/Ed Norton vehicle, 'Rounders,' and to a lesser extent for his noir-ish films, 'Red Rock West' and 'The Last Seduction,' but he acquits himself well with this very straightforward historical drama. The cast delivers a fine ensemble effort rather than 'star' power, and the movie is all the better for it. Compare to when Ted Danson popped up in 'Saving Private Ryan'--I almost expected everyone to start singing, '...everyone knows your name.' I haven't found a war movie this unobtrusively engaging since 'Stalingrad' (a look at the German perspective that I wholeheartedly recommend, btw). Dahl helms a clean and relatively simple staging of a rather grimy and no doubt more complex tale of individual heroism and coordinated derring-do than this film has room to encompass.I'm somewhat bemused that the film was not shot on location in the Philippines. Politics, no doubt. Cost, possibly. Still, even this once-upon-a-time resident alien found little to question about the film's verisimilitude. I think all I missed was the throng of Jitneys I remember flooding the streets of Manila and its suburbs, and I realize that the Jitney explosion didn't really happen until after the war.The combat sequences are handled well, and mercifully lacking the faux-documentary shaky-cam cinematography present in so many recent war films. The action is clean and understandable, thanks to some careful exposition, and the firefights are believably realistic without being overly gory. This isn't, after all, a film about the horrors of war so much as a film about the courage and determination that triumphantly overcome those horrors. Kudos to all involved.",7,2,3,26 June 2006
In Time," Time out, please...
","...for me to digest the fact that this misfire sprang from the brainpan of writer/director, Andrew 'Gattaca' Niccol, who has also blessed us with the likes of 'Simone,''Lords of War,' and (script only) 'The Truman Show.' I am unsurprised to discover that 'In Time' essentially tanked domestically, and somewhat saddened to see it did rather well internationally. For all its topicality and production value, it's still pretty much a polished bolus of a film.Threadbare storyline to the side (amply detailed elsewhere on this board), 'In Time' falls apart primarily due to its failure to adequately justify/explain its fantastical premise, and in particular ruined itself for me in the poker game sequence, in which our ostensible hero (Justin 'NSYNC' Timberlake) providentially beats the temporal tycoon father (Vincent 'Mad Men' Kartheiser) of his lovely soon-to-be partner-in-timecrime (Amanda 'Chloe' Seyfried) in a game of Texas Hold'em. Not only does our boy stupidly call a long-odds bet, staying on the turn in hopes of filling an inside straight, he then fails to raise when he achieves the lock hand, and to top it off has the temerity to tell his opponent, 'I knew I was going to win.' Right. When stories hinge on such unlikelihoods, credibility falls by the wayside, and 'In Time' simply doesn't offer enough to make up for it.Otherwise well shot by ace lensman, Roger 'pick one' Deakins, and well produced/designed/costumed, etc., etc., etc., 'In Time' proves itself to be little more than a high-rent 'The Twilight Zone' episode that fails to validate its thematic conceits, preferring to indulge in various low-rent witticisms ('99 Second' stores) and unsubtle 'time is money' social commentary emphasizing topical rich vs. poor concerns. Beyond that, it's a simple chase film owing its time-wasting debt to the likes of 'Logan's Run' and 'Bonnie & Clyde,' as many have noted elsewhere (I'd add 'Thelma & Louise,' too). Support from the likes of Cillian '28 Days Later' Murphy, Olivia 'Turistas' Wilde, and Alex 'I Am Number Four' Pettyfer is small comfort.Sadly, 'In Time' is one of those movies that makes you wonder, once it's over, how much better it might have been had more attention been paid to the scripting. Vaguely worth a watch, but only if you have time on your hands (and nothing better to do).",4,0,2,3 February 2012
Zombieland," Another finger-lickin' good entry in the zomedy genre...
","...'Zombieland' isn't quite the masterpiece that its current IMDb rating would seem to indicate, but nonetheless earns its place alongside genre entries like 'Shaun of the Dead,' 'Fido,' and even hoary old classics like 'Return of the Living Dead' and 'Dead Alive.' Written and produced by a reasonably experienced writer/producer team, 'Zombieland' features a serviceable, if not terribly original, script that succeeds primarily on the strength of decent ensemble acting and strong production values. Much like Zack Snyder's reworking of 'Dawn of the Dead,' the best part of 'Zombieland' is the opening sequence, a lovely, kinetic intro that sets the extremely comic-booky tone of the film.The leads handle their (mostly) stereotypical roles well; Jesse 'Cursed' Eisenberg riffs on his well-established Jewish nerd persona, and likewise, Woody 'Cheers' Harrelson does his shtick. Emma 'The House Bunny' Stone and Abigail 'Signs' Breslin play our nebbish leads' faux antagonists with aplomb, despite the lack of much to work with character-wise. It's mostly the production design by Maher 'The Guardian' Ahmad and camera-work by Michael 'Cloverfield' Bonvillain that carries things along with sass and vinegar. Ruben Fleischer's debut feature direction is competent, if unshowy; there's really only so much one can do with a relatively pedestrian script.The ratings on this one are going to drop considerably once it reaches home video (with its older, more sophisticated--and jaded--audience) and wider international distribution. 'Zombieland' is sufficiently entertaining, but a far cry from a Top 250 film, or even a Top 500 or Top 1000. Zombie fans will not be overly impressed, since the 'zombies' are pretty much '28 Days/Weeks Later' viral infection victims and not the undead; head shots are not required. Nebbish comedy fans will have to deal with the extraneous gore, and road movie fans will have to endure the film's general lack of significant characterization and thematic content.All that said, 'Zombieland' is still fun. Just don't be fooled by its current lauding here on the IMDb. Instead, simply let this one whet your appetite for the eventual release of 'World War Z,' which will (hopefully) make you forget all about 'Zombieland.'Edit: Had a second look at this one on DVD, and stand by the above comments. It seems obvious to me that younger viewers than myself are easily impressed, apparently by slo-mo spewing of bodily fluids, bouncing of zombie breasts, and TV-grade one-liners. Again, this one is more than worth a watch--it's far from bad--but don't expect to be cranking this one through the visual cortex on a regular basis; there's just not enough meat on 'Zombieland''s bones to provide more than a snack.",7,1,5,10 October 2009
It's a Wonderful Life," Perennial favorite has worn well with time...
","...and remains one of the few film classics that absolutely, in my mind, should never, ever be remade. The reader may wonder why I don't rate it higher than '8' if I feel that way, but I have reasons.One, the story relies on various conceits to make its point about George's importance to the people around him. Take, for instance, the opening sequence in which George saves his little brother, Harry, from drowning. Later, we learn that Harry grows up to become a WWII hero, winning the Congressional Medal of Honor by saving a troop transport from a kamikaze attack. In Pottersville, however, George's non-existence translates to an unsaved Harry and a transport load of troops sent to Davey Jones' locker. All well and good, but this scenario ignores two things: someone else might well have saved Harry's life, and even more significantly, without George, Harry might well have never fallen into the icy pond in the first place. Similar arguments can be made for virtually every other character whose future in Pottersville is radically altered by George's non-being.Two, the film is rife with a certain nostalgic myopia, painting a vision of American life that really never existed outside of a Norman Rockwell painting.Three, it overtly reinforces supernaturalism and irrationality, depending on heavenly intervention to remedy human error. This is, however, no surprise given the tenor of the times in which it was produced, as well as the very human tendency toward superstition that has been with us since longer than we've been able to write, let alone make movies.However, none of these flaws can overly tarnish what Frank Capra himself identified as his favorite movie that he made. 'It's a Wonderful Life' remains a rare gem in the treasury of American film-making, an unabashedly sentimental fable about the worth of the individual and the value of hearth and home, family and friends. It is a fairy tale meant for adults, yet accessible to children. Its language is sweet and simple, based primarily on the vocabulary of love and friendship. Its technical aspects are noteworthy (the fake snow, the elaborate Bedford Falls set, the superb use of Dmitri Tiomkin's score and other music, the fine camera-work), the casting is impeccable (can you possibly imagine anyone besides Jimmy Stewart playing George Bailey?), and of course, the direction is top grade.Scene after scene burns itself into the viewer's consciousness: Mr. Gower's gut-wrenching realization that George has saved him from poisoning an innocent; a grown-up Violet sashaying past George and the boys; George and Mary's first date, and a number of years later, their first kiss (perhaps one of the greatest screen kisses ever consummated); George's breakdown, both at home and at Martini's pub; a callous Nick in Pottersville, banging on the cash register and cackling, 'Get me, I'm handing out wings!' The list goes on and on, and no doubt every viewer has his or her own favorites. Myself, I'm still partial to 'Why don't you kiss her instead of talking her to death?' followed by 'Ah, youth is wasted on the wrong people!' It's incredibly rare to see such a film rated highly by the IMDb crowd, young and male as it is. 50k+ voters and a 42% '10' rating. Astounding! Even the usual gang of pessimists, cynics, and naysayers couldn't rack up better than 5% poor ('1,' '2,' or '3') votes. Amazing! The one anomaly that intrigues me is the relatively low vote of the sub-18 female cohort. I can only speculate that they had a hard time identifying with Mary, the one character they perhaps recognize as having had more direct impact on George's 'failures' than any other. Could it be they are somewhat embarrassed by the machinations of their own gender? All in all, 'It's a Wonderful Life' works because we want it to work. It embodies a timeless appeal to humankind's better side, the side that wants to do the right thing regardless of the cost. For that it will always remain a top-rank film to be enjoyed year after year.One small side note: I recently completed a two-month stint in a musical version of 'It's a Wonderful Life' in which Clarence getting his wings takes on far too much import. The cast almost unanimously disliked the script we had to perform, primarily because the songs, although pretty enough, failed by and large to advance the plot, reducing the story to its bare bones, discarding or horribly distorting scene after favorite scene, and reducing many characters to barely recognizable caricatures. I won't say which musical version it is (there are several), but I will advise you to avoid it at all costs if you are any sort of purist about the film. You won't be glad you saw it, no matter how well it's performed.",8,1,6,10 January 2007
The Departed," This won Best Picture?
","I caught Scorsese's latest at a second-run house after the Academy Awards had been dealt out, and was left perplexed that this remake of the Hong Kong quickie, 'Mou gaan dou (Infernal Affairs),' garnered Best Picture and secured Scorsese's long-overdue win as Best Director.Make no mistake, 'The Departed' is an entertaining thriller, well acted for the most part, well-directed, shot and produced well, but Best Picture? I think not. Scorsese has done much better, more memorable, interesting films. 'Gangs of New York' and 'Goodfellas' spring instantly to mind. My opinion is that the Academy has simply finally given Scorsese his long-awaited props as a filmmaker, nothing more. It won't be too long before 'The Departed' joins past Oscar winners like 'The English Patient' in the ranks of attractive, but totally dispensable film entertainment.That said, I thought the film was overly long. The subplot involving the leads' mutual paramour, the lovely Vera 'The Manchurian Candidate' Farmiga, was mostly unnecessary padding to the slim story. Matt Damon is fine as the flip side to Leonardo DiCaprio's heads-up coin, although original choice Brad Pitt would have served equally well, and DiCaprio shows that he's here to stay as a talented and bankable star. Jack Nicholson does what he does best (chew scenery), but strikes me as about as Irish as--oh, I don't know--Mr. Whipple. The rest of the cast is competent, but not overly distinguished; virtually all of their roles could have been assayed by other actors. Wahlberg's nomination for Best Supporting Actor is an equal mystery to me; he did nothing he hasn't done before, and better.I just don't see 'The Departed' having much to offer beyond a few hours of idle entertainment. It's a good movie, but hardly a classic, and definitely not one of Scorsese's best.",7,2,4,12 March 2007
Rosemary's Baby," Classic Polanski still manages to chill after nearly four decades...
","...and despite a few chips around the edges, remains a notably strong piece of thriller film-making, certainly one of Polanski's best works. I'm not sure I can fairly rank it as a Top-100 film, except within the horror/thriller genre, or even a Top-250 film, as the IMDb voters rate it, but there's no denying that it's one of the most memorable films of the late sixties. The dexterity with which Polanski slowly ratchets up the tension and paranoid unease, the remarkable performances (especially from Mia Farrow as Rosemary, and Ruth Gordon as Rosemary's nemesis, Mrs. Castavet), the unique setting of the Dakota, William Fraker's fine DP work, Krzysztof Komeda's unsettling score; all contribute to an amazing movie-going experience that culminates in the final, shockingly maternal twist ending.Now, all that to the side, I'm going to venture into dirtied waters here and say that I'd love to see an updated version of 'Rosemary's Baby' along the lines of 'The Omen' remake. Audiences are more sophisticated these days, as are acting and storytelling techniques, and from this viewer's perspective, 'Rosemary's Baby' telegraphs its eventual payoff in more ways than one. Victoria Vetri's Terry, the Castavet's original guinea pig, is introduced and killed off so quickly that the event stands out like a sore thumb. John Cassavettes' performance is, by modern standards, notably unsubtle; he is identifiably a 'bad guy' almost from the moment he meets the Castavets, if not sooner. His behavior is decidedly sexist and domineering; no modern female worthy of the name would put up with his selfishness and deceptions. I'd love to see someone like Christian Bale or Ed Norton take on the role. Ruth Gordon's intrusive Minnie at times seems utterly transparent in her kvetching insistence on pumping Rosemary full of Satanic potions. Certainly no woman who'd ever read 'Our Bodies, Our Selves' would give a quack like Dr. Sapperstein more than one visit. And even Rosemary seems anachronistically naive and sheltered from the grim realities of life, though perhaps I've overlooked some back story that explains that. Regardless, I'd love to see one of our recent crop of fine young actresses tackle the role: Reese Witherspoon, Natalie Portman, Hillary Swank, etc., or even an unknown with the requisite talent.It's been nearly four decades, and despite all the supernatural spin-offs like 'The Exorcist' and 'The Omen' and 'The Seventh Sign' and so on and so forth, 'Rosemary's Baby' retains its vaunted position in the pantheon of top-rank chillers. I'd love to see a new version attempt to dethrone it.",8,2,3,8 July 2006
30 Days of Night," Frostbitten fang fun, with horrific moments that glisten...
","...though not overly memorable, were it not for the amusing premise. Barrow, Alaska, the northernmost community of the United States, has entered an extended period of polar night in which the sun fails to 'crack dawn' for a good long time (the film posits a titular thirty days, but in truth it lasts more than two months). In the movies, we all know what comes out at night to play: bad things. In this case, vampires, and there's none of that decadent, dandified, pseudo-romantic Ann Rice crap. Director David 'Hard Candy' Slade and writers Stuart 'Derailed' Beattie, Brian 'Hard Candy' Nelson, and Steve 'I created the original comic book' Niles treat their audience to bloodsuckers who possess nary a trace of a redeeming characteristic. They sport formidable dentures and an aggressive attitude to match, not to mention some pretty sloppy table manners. In fact, it's the vampires that make '30 Days of Night' a sanguine guilty pleasure to watch, since most all their victims are either relatively faceless fodder or, regrettably, characters that we're never really led to care all that much about.Still, the acting is tolerable, with special kudos to Danny 'Children of Men' Huston as one of the more impressive and disturbing villains I've seen in a while, and Ben 'Hostage' Foster as his doomed harbinger. Josh 'Sin City' Hartnett, local cop, leads what few humans survive the initial vampiric onslaught, including estranged wife (Melissa 'Derailed' George), kid brother (Mark 'Arthur' Rendall), local salt-of-the-earther (Mark 'Batman Begins' Boone Junior), and NZ/Aussie star Manu 'The Condemned' Bennett as Hartnett's benighted sidekick. Production values are high, with art direction, production design, and cinematography appropriately dark and menacing; all in all, it's a nice, creepy, claustrophobic visual realization, much along the lines of John Carpenter's 'The Thing.' The plot is a straightforward 'circled wagons' yarn, laced with some nicely stark dialog that only rarely makes you cringe. The visuals and make-up fx are excellent, with plenty of blood and mayhem to satisfy even jaded gorehounds. Some of the intro storytelling seems perfunctory, or perhaps overly edited to save time, but once the vampires strike in force, '30 Days...' goes for the throat with carnivorous gusto. If nothing else, it's a definite thumbs-up for feral vampire fans (not to mention fans of feral vampires).I see that a sequel is in the works, but I won't expect it to be anything to write home about. '30 Days of Night' sports a few too many 'oh, c'mons' to pass muster as a classic, but it wraps itself up tidily enough to claw its way above the lower ranks of fang films. A sequel will most likely tarnish whatever bloodstained, frostbitten notoriety '30 Days of Night' has achieved. It was a worthy 2d-run night out, and possibly will merit time on the DVD player this winter, but for sheer fright-film entertainment, I preferred 'The Mist,' to be honest.",6,0,1,29 November 2007
American Gangster," A fine, but currently overrated crime bio-pic...
","...'American Gangster' is a strong film that unfortunately has limited repeat viewability save for Denzel 'Glory' Washington and/or Russell 'Romper Stomper' Crowe fans. Its current position as an IMDb Top 250 film (albeit near the bottom of that list) is most assuredly a temporary aberration; as newer films catch the fickle fancy of youthful moviegoers, it will fall off the list. Still, it's a fine piece of entertainment, if a less than accurate one (according to what I've read about it), and does manage to convey the zeitgeist of the time period fairly well, despite the plethora of visual anachronisms that eagle-eyed viewers may be apt to catch. Script doctor Steven 'Schindler's List' Zaillian's screenplay delineates the rise and fall of a notorious Harlem drug kingpin in the late 60s/early 70s, while limning in tandem the problematic circumstances of the policeman aiming to bring him down. The usual issues of honor, integrity, and purpose are explored to varying effect (cf. 'The Godfather,' 'Casino,' 'Once Upon a Time in America,' etc.), and the minutia of drug-dealing and criminal investigation are convincingly illustrated (see 'The French Connection,' 'Goodfellas,' 'Blow,' and so forth and so on). Washington delivers yet another excellent performance as the homicidal crook with a sense of gentlemanly conduct, Crowe is equally strong as his determined opponent, and the rest of the cast is pretty much without fault. Production values are the expected top-rank, Harris 'Zodiac' Savides DP work is superb, the score and incidental music selections are of a piece, and who can argue with Clarence 'The Mod Squad' Williams III in an uncredited cameo role? All in all, a fine several hours of Crimestoppers entertainment, but far from the 'classic' status that the current IMDb rating would indicate.",7,2,3,23 August 2008
WALL·E," 'WALL-E' proves the fatal flaw in 'Cars'...
","...was the lack of direct connection to the world of humans (despite the anthropomorphic appeal of the title character and his sleek, hi-tech inamorata); with 'WALL-E' (and last year's wonderful 'Ratatouille'), Pixar Animation Studios has more than obviously learned from their past mistake. Sentient machines, even those capable of emotional response, have become an accepted part of our culture, but only because they are a part of OUR culture. They are our Promethean creation, and their fire emanates directly from our fingertips, not from the lightning bolts of remote deity. Thank you, Pixar, for realizing this and giving us a story firmly rooted in humanity, however far removed from 'reality.''WALL-E' is basically a love story heavily cloaked in science-fantasy elements: lonely boy meets girl, tags along on her predestined quest, and finally wins girl while coincidentally saving the human race from a fate perhaps worse than death. Fairly simple stuff, done with the usual grace and wit that keeps Pixar one step ahead of the competition, 'WALL-E' is quite kid-friendly, yet retains the adult sensibility that defines Pixar's brand of animated entertainment. Writer/director Andrew 'Finding Nemo' Stanton has come through yet again with likable characters, an engaging conflict to drive them, and a number of pointed observations along the way that are almost never heavy-handed, but manage to touch us with a sense of import. I'll be very much looking forward to seeing what he does with 'John Carter of Mars.' Oh, and did I mention that the animation is >insert superlative here<? It is, absolutely stunning. Or that the camera-work, editing, production design and so forth are all of a kind? Yep. Did I say the music by Thomas 'Jarhead' Newman is utterly >insert appropriate descriptive here<? It is. That the nods to various sci-film inspirations are apt (cf. Signourney 'Alien' Weaver's computer voice during a self-destruct sequence)? You got it.And did I also mention that 'Presto,' the de rigueur short feature before the film (and as close to a Bugs & Daffy cartoon that Pixar is ever likely to get), is absolutely worth making sure that you get to the cinema on time? It is. I'll be looking forward to it on the DVD.My rating of 'WALL-E' may very well jump to the ultimate notch upon re-watching it, but for now near-perfection will have to be fair recommendation. You could easily do worse for your entertainment dollar, and would have a darn hard time doing better.11.17.08 edit: Caught this one again second run and enjoyed it just as much. Can't quite bring myself to bump it to a '10' yet, but the DVD release awaits....",9,2,5,27 June 2008
Rango," There's a new animator in town...
","...and his name is Industrial Light & Magic. He's packin' some heavy iron in the form of excellent direction by Gore 'Pirates...' Verbinski, a unique photo-realistic cartoony-ness, with a solid (though not extraordinary) script to boot, courtesy of John 'Gladiator' Logan (with story assistance from Verbinski and James Ward 'Rango--the video game' Byrkit), a fine sagebrush score by tune-slinger, Hans 'Inception' Zimmer, and sterling voice work from the likes of Johnny 'The name's Rango' Depp, Isla 'I'm married to Bruno!' Fisher, Ned 'You...will...atone!' Beatty, Alfred 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' Molina, and Bill 'Gore likes me' Nighy, among numerous others. At times reminiscent of some of the older Looney Tunes features, 'Rango' sports a fair complement of in-jokes and homages to a variety of sources, including 'High Noon,' 'Apocalypse Now,' 'Chinatown,' and Leone/Eastwood's iconic 'Man With No Name.' The film's (relative) failure at the box office--it missed the mark on earning back production costs domestically--was likely a consequence of a somewhat darker, mordant edge to its humor and storyline that made it less appealing to children, coupled with an inescapable current of video-gamishness (cf. Byrkit's likely contributions) that dissipated adult interest. Nonetheless, it will undoubtedly do well on video, and hopefully well enough to encourage ILM into further animated ventures. I found it more than entertaining and a likely candidate for repeat viewings. YMMV, but it absolutely worth at least one watch, even for the price of a rental.",8,0,0,3 September 2011
Prometheus," Coulda, shoulda, woulda...
","...but didn't, mostly thanks to a script that yearns to live up to the 3D surcharge but can't quite cut it. I'm sure 'Prometheus' looked great in the theaters, no doubt, but the story is too boneheaded at times to allow significant willing suspension of disbelief. Most anyone reading this already knows what I'm talking about. Although the story provides a genesis, of sorts, for the 'Alien' chronology, 'Prometheus' concerns itself with loftier conceits while ignoring a lot of common sense and natural laws along the way. The cast is fine, with Michael 'Band of Brothers' Fassbender a standout as the morally ambiguous android, and Noomi 'The Girl With...' Rapace as the dauntless heroine destined for a sequel likely to be just as loaded with 'oh, c'mon!s' as its progenitor. The less spent the better, but worth a watch if only for the meticulous production design and special effects, basically a B-movie with an A-budget. Charlize 'Monster' Theron groupies will not be sated, but neither displeased. Ultimately, 'Prometheus' promises fire but settles for routine sci-fantasy with top flight visuals.",6,2,2,25 November 2012
Taken 2," Might have been better titled, 'Taken Again'...
","...since that is assuredly what happened to audiences worldwide. The first film was really no great shakes, but at least maintained a sense of consistency and reality that didn't leave viewers shaking their heads. This follow-up from the same writing team of Luc 'The Professional' Besson and Robert Mark 'The Fifth Element' Kamen just doesn't cut the mustard, the cake, or even the cheese. It's tired, trite, and terminally boring, and I can't really blame the new director, Olivier 'Columbiana' Megaton. It's all in that lackluster script, as is always the case in duds like this one. Liam 'Thanks for the paycheck' Neeson brings nothing new to the table (and hasn't for quite some time now), and the rest of the cast is, well, happy to take their paychecks, too. In a nutshell: utterly disposable and forgettable. Don't let yourself be taken as well; there are far too many better films out there for you to be wasting your time with this one.",4,1,1,27 May 2013
Iron Man," The tastiest superhero du jour so far...
","...thanks to a remarkably coherent script from four guys (usually a sign of last-minute rewrites and trouble in River City), some seriously immaculate production and visual design (from outfits like The Orphanage, ILM, and Stan Winston Studio), and most of all a sterling performance from Robert 'Weird Science' Downey, Jr. as genius mega-tycoon Tony Stark aka Iron Man. Downey has had quite the roller-coaster career, and 'Iron Man' is going to be one of its peaks, no question. He's pitch perfect, occupying the role like nobody's business, and although his transition from smug, self-involved war profiteer to conscience-stricken humanitarian seems little more than a pragmatic result of nearly being done in by his own weaponry, and leaves the audience wondering just how naive this wunderkind is in the first place, Downey plays the absurdity of it all with both good-natured relish and a certain restraint.Director Jon 'Elf' Favreau elicits more than competent performances from the rest of his cast as well. Gwyneth 'Proof' Paltrow fills Stark's gal Friday 'Pepper' Potts' shoes with grace and a smoldering promise of things yet to come in the inevitable sequel (get your free hint at the end of the credits reel), while Jeff 'Starman' Bridges genially gobbles scenery as the bad guy. Terrence 'Hustle & Flow' Howard is somewhat wasted as Stark's military insider, and Leslie 'Popular' Bibbs has little to do beyond look good as a bimbo journalist with a brain (Brown? Color me bemused!), but Shaun 'Crash' Toub is excellent as Stark's savior in Afghanistan, and Clark 'We Were Soldiers' Gregg will no doubt enjoy more to do as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent under the command of Samuel L. Jackson.Anyway, as the first genuine blockbuster of the summer, 'Iron Man' serves perfectly. Plenty of action, but not tiringly so, a script that mostly treats its characters intelligently and with a sense of humor that never condescends, outstanding production values, and even a score that never overwhelms nor tries to elicit emotional response that isn't otherwise deserved; what more can one ask? I haven't had this much fun since 'Spider-Man' or 'Batman Begins,' and I'll be back in the theater to see this one again, soon, if only to prep for 'The Incredible Hulk' (in which Stark/Iron Man will apparently make at least a cameo appearance).Cynics may object to the de rigueur 'sci-fience' that 'Iron Man' relies upon to exist, but that doesn't make the film any less entertaining or worthy of seeing on the big screen. Don't miss it!",8,3,6,8 May 2008
Beowulf," As frustrating as its visual predecessor, '300'...
","...Robert 'Contact' Zemeckis' 'Beowulf' is a visually sumptuous film (which, at $150mil cost, it ought to be!) that unfortunately thoroughly betrays its source material. Not that that kept me from being entertained, understand, but I was still taken aback by such extreme revisionism. Other posters here have detailed the butchery, so I won't bother, but it's a shame that talented scripters like Neil 'Stardust' Gaiman and Roger 'Killing Zoe' Avary took a decade to deliver such a puerile, exploitative script. If they'd stuck to the real deal, I'd be willing to bet the film would have done better at the box office, but what do I know? The voice work is mostly impeccable, though I noticed a few instances in which the dialog didn't seem to match the animation. 'Beowulf' sports plenty of star wattage: Ray 'The Departed' Winstone, Anthony 'you have to ask?' Hopkins, John 'ditto' Malkovich, Crispin 'Willard' Glover, the remarkable Brendan '28 Days Later...' Gleeson, Robin Wright 'Empire Falls' Penn (who regrettably looks the least like her animated self), and the ever provocative Angelina 'Gia' Jolie; all acquit themselves well, but fail to transcend the material, with the possible exception of Gleeson. As they say, it's tough to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.The problem lies partly with the otherwise stunning visuals provided by Gentle 'Fight Club' Giant Studios, Sony Pictures 'The Polar Express' Imageworks, and W.M. 'Van Helsing' Creations. The rendering of the human characters fails to instill them with any real life, particularly in the eyes, and leaves one feeling that one is watching an elaborate computer game. The result is that it's very difficult to establish any real identification with the characters, a fate that '300' suffered as well. More's the pity, since everything else is such a feast. It's all wonderful eye candy, thanks to Norman 'War of the Worlds' Newberry's lush art direction and Doug 'The Polar Express' Chiang's superb production design, but it all seems ultimately empty and forgettable. The lensing by Robert 'The Polar Express' Presley swoops and soars, and must be extremely impressive when viewed in the intended 3-D format (even in 2-D, it's pretty daggone nice), while Jeremiah 'The Polar Express' O'Driscoll's editing is clean and concise. Alan 'Night at the Museum' Silvestri's score is evocative and not overly manipulative.For empty-calorie viewing, 'Beowulf' succeeds nicely. For devotees of the original epic poem/legend, the film fails in a big way; students of the literature will find nothing of interest here. Watch-once film-making as far as I'm concerned, though should I ever get the chance to watch it in 3-D, I may bite.",6,1,2,31 July 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," A mostly satisfying BSM...
","...which is to say, Big Stupid Movie. Helmed surprisingly well by Len 'Underworld' Wiseman, 'Live Free or Die Hard' positions itself nicely as what will hopefully be a fitting end to one of the better franchises in Hollywood history. The action is almost non-stop; the production values are excellent thanks to the likes of production designer Patrick 'I am a man of many talents' Tatopoulos, and art directors Beat 'Star Trek' Frutiger and James 'Polar Express' Hegedus; Simon 'I, Robot' Duggan's cinematography is fluidly enervating, aided by Nicolas 'Terminator 3' De Toth's precise editing and Marco '3:10 to Yuma' Beltrami's fine score. I don't think anyone can argue that the $110mil budget was frittered away, unlike the more recent disappointment, 'I Am Legend.' Acting-wise, our sturdy Bruce 'no longer moonlighting' Willis hero, John McClane, is in fine form, albeit a dozen years more grizzled and world-weary. Some fans have complained that he's not the same McClane, but I wonder why anyone would expect that after more than a decade since his last brouhaha. People change over time, and I have no problem with fictional ones doing the same. They'd be boring if they didn't. Of course, this McClane has the usual cartoonish ability to avoid bullets and survive bone-breaking falls and beatings, but with the exception of the first film (to some extent), that's par for the course, especially in this age of video game indestructibility. 'LFoDH' is still, after all, a BSM.Timothy 'Deadwood' Olyphant may not measure up to the steely menace of his predecessors, but acquits himself well nonetheless. Maggie 'Mission : Impossible III' Q. is fetching as his butt-kicking automaton henchwoman. Justin 'Jeepers Creepers' Long is surprisingly appealing as McClane's unintended sidekick, while Mary Elizabeth 'Grindhouse' Winstead suitably apes her screen father's persona. The slew of baddies (where did Olyphant's uber-hacker hire all these guys?) and rasher of good guys acquit themselves as expected, with notably limber antics from stuntman/actor Cyril 'The Transporter' Raffaelli, and some shameless paycheck-taking from Kevin 'I'm not really an actor' Smith. All in all, a good time was obviously had by all.Mark 'Godsend' Bomback's screenplay may be comic book crap, but it serves its purpose, which is to showcase McClane's superhuman durability and dogged determination. Why would anyone expect anything else? Nothing will ever match the original film anyway, at least not in my book, and if by some miracle something does, I'll be the first to admit it. Though definitely a big screen film, 'LFoDH' translates well to video, especially in its unrated DVD form. Yippy-ki-ay, indeed.",7,1,3,7 February 2008
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Still effective after a quarter-century of CGI-fests...
","...Wes 'The Hills Have Eyes' Craven's 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' packs a solid punch despite its low budget (cheaper than Romero's soon-to-be-released 'Day of the Dead'), mostly unremarkable acting (not bad, just unremarkable), and the desperately-seeking-sequels ending. All in all, it's one of the best of the 80s fright films, and a welcome respite from Craven's previous failures (the fairly horrendous 'Swamp Thing' and 'Deadly Blessing,' as well as that excruciating TV stinker 'Invitation to Hell'). If nothing else, it'll always be the answer to trivia games asking about Johnny Depp's first film.What's most notable on re-viewing 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' is that Craven and his crew achieved everything without benefit of elaborate gimmickry or computer-driven effects, and next to nothing in the way of showoff camera shots. It's a film about affects, not effects, and that makes all the difference. It's idea- and character-based, and that lets the audience slide right into its world with little trouble.The boogeyman, everyone's favorite Freddy, makes his appearance right up front in the pre-title intro, but he really isn't dwelt upon; his province is in the shadows and in the mind. We get peeks at him, and those peeks are creepy enough to suit; he'd be just another grotesque if he were hauled out into the light of day (which is why all the sequels were such disappointing failures; they gave us too much Freddy, and thereby turned him into an unfrightening, though homicidal, clown). Craven learned his lesson well from John Carpenter's 'Halloween.' I'm sure I'll catch the remake when it pops up at my local library, but I've otherwise no interest in tracking it down. I already know it can't possibly match the impact of this seminal work.Oct10 edit: found said remake at the library. I was right; it was utterly unnecessary, boring, and brought nothing new to the table. I gave it a 4/10 for production values only. Totally skippable.",7,2,2,3 August 2010
300," A feast of empty calories...
","...'300' is yet another film realization of comic book 'enfante terrible' Frank Miller's dark and unforgiving vision of humanity, and director/co-screenwriter Zack 'Dawn of the Dead (2004)' Snyder's equally Hobbesian outlook. It's a combination that pays off visually to the extreme, but also fails to connect with any significant emotional depth or impact. And that's a shame.If Snyder's intent was to simply animate Miller's comic book, he quite obviously more than succeeded. Even more so than 'Sin City,' '300' is a comic book come to life, right down to the inkblot blood spatters throughout the combat sequences. Everything is larger than life (and not just Xerxes), nearly surrealistically so. Loads of use of desaturated color and stuttering slow-mo, along with CGI sets and image enhancement contribute to the overall effect of a comic book come to life. Larry 'Lost' Fong's camera-work is kinetic in the action scenes and a stark microscope in close-ups. The overall effect is mesmerizing, and yet empty. Unlike 'Sin City,' this is a film in which the story is utterly subservient to the visuals, instead of the other way around, and it keeps its audience at a distance, refusing to connect on an emotional level (unless you count the release of adrenaline and testosterone to be emotional), despite the best efforts of leads Gerard 'Dracula 2000' Butler and Leona 'The Cave' Headey to build some sort of relationship with which modern audiences might empathize. In its attempt to raise 'sword and sandal' epics to new cinematic heights, '300' still fails to create the human connection that made 'Gladiator' a more compelling, interesting film. The intrusion of fantasy elements didn't help much, either, proving to further remove audience interest in any historical lessons to be learned.The result of Snyder's recreation of Miller's stylized violence? Surprisingly little original insight into the nature of Spartan culture (not that I expected such) beyond the y-chromosome posturings of machismo honor and female subjugation to the warrior ethos, despite the independent efforts of Leonidas' queen. Much like Snyder's reworking of 'Dawn of the Dead,' '300' is an emotionless adventure game that fails to engage the audience's soul or heart. It appeals primarily to the eye and ear alone.(11.15.07 edit) I'm not surprised to see that the older the IMDber, the lower the rating for '300,' but still find it intriguing that females rate the film equally or higher than males, except the 45+ cohort. I would guess this may have to do with the beefcake factor; anachronistic buff torsos predominate, and older females are perhaps less impressed by such eye candy, not to mention indifferent to the shallow thrills of testosterone-laden combat sequences.I suspect that ratings for this film will decline as more home viewers weigh in with their verdicts, and those who have already seen it adjust their scoring when they realize how superficial '300' really is.",6,1,5,30 March 2007
Cube," Ambitious, though flawed...
","...this feature-length debut from storyboard-artist-turned-writer/director, Vincenzo 'Splice' Natali, remains a notable late-90s cult classic, presaging the Grand Guignol machinations of the 'Saw' franchise while drawing on a raft of cinematic and literary predecessors as diverse as Kafka, 'The Outer Limits,' 'Waiting for Godot' and 'Lord of the Flies.' The concept is simple: a handful of characters imprisoned in what turns out to be a matrix of cubes (that periodically shift position within a larger cube) who must find their way out before dying of starvation/dehydration. The whys and wherefores are only vaguely explained (one character apparently helped design this fantastical apparatus), and it doesn't help that many of the cubes feature deadly traps that aren't easy to detect in advance, but it's the clash of personalities that gives 'Cube' its raison d'être, elevating it above the herd of low-fi wannabees into the realm of cult status.The acting is mostly hammy, the plot has a tendency to derail itself in favor of melodramatic excess, and there are numerous flaws in the story itself (a math geek who doesn't instantly recognize obvious non-prime numbers, or how long it takes these folks to realize the cubes are shifting position), but in its totality, 'Cube' still manages to hold the viewer. Ably lensed by Derek 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' Rogers, suitably scored by Mark 'The Border' Korven, and featuring some early fx work from C.O.R.E. 'The Tudors' Digital Pictures, 'Cube' achieves a good deal with its low budget, and certainly more than enough to justify a viewing by various genre fans. It's over-rated on this site for reasons I can't even begin to understand, but still worth the time spent with it.",6,0,1,7 June 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Perhaps too clever for its intended audience...
","...and apparently well over the head of many a commentator on this benighted site, 'Cabin in the Woods' nevertheless adds another worthy notch to the belts of writer/producer Joss 'Firefly' Whedon and writer/tyro director Drew 'Cloverfield' Goddard. Its deft deconstruction of horror movie tropes wedded to an outlandish Act Three reveal of Lovecraftian fantasy sets 'Cabin in the Woods' firmly above the bulk of its LCD competition. Whedon may have cut his eyeteeth with dross like 'Roseanne' and 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer,' but his truest creative successes have always come with genuinely intelligent creations like 'Toy Story,' 'Firefly'/'Serenity,' (yes) 'The Avengers,' and 'Cabin in the Woods.' Goddard handles his fine cast extremely well, with nary a flicker of self-conscious aren't-we-cleverness. Everything is of a piece: acting, effects, and camera-wrangling. Had the powers-that-be not foolishly delayed the film in a misguided attempt to render it in 3D, thus consigning it to a less than appropriate early spring release, I'm convinced it would have done much better box office than it did. Still, it did decent business worldwide, and is likely to have a strong video run, and if nothing else will be a cult favorite for some years to come.Needless to say, highly recommended to fans of the genre. I'd wax even more enthusiastic in detail, but I think my time would be better spent rewatching it.",8,7,13,26 October 2012
Windtalkers," Overlong, over-reaching, overwrought...
","...and underwhelming, 'Windtalkers' will never be more than one of John Woo's lesser films, and certainly not one of Nicholas Cage's memorable ones. The script by John Rice and Joe Batteer bites off far more than it can chew, and seems to have thrown their screen writing careers into the dumper. Perhaps we should be thankful. We're given too many characters to care about, which makes it difficult to care about any of them, even the leads; a side plot involving a Navy nurse (Frances 'A.I.' O'Connor) goes absolutely nowhere. Set during the Battle of Saipan in WWII, 'Windtalkers' is ostensibly about the critical value of Navajo radiomen (their language was incomprehensible to the Japanese), but really turns out to be a mundane war buddy story centered on Cage's character, who has been detailed to protect one particular Navajo soldier (played with great sympathy by Adam 'Flags of Our Fathers' Beach). Despite some excellent lensmanship from Jeffrey 'Jacob's Ladder' Kimball, and lavish production values, it just doesn't work, at least not to the extent one expects from John 'Hard-Boiled' Woo. Even his trademark slo-mo bullets'n'blood choreography seems perfunctory. Various character actors, including Peter 'Fargo' Stormare, Noah 'Cop Land' Emmerich, Mark 'Zodiac' Ruffalo, and a resume-padding Christian 'Run For the Money' Slater, do what they can with their mostly forgettable dialogue and ridiculous battle set pieces, but their efforts, along with more squibs and explosions than I've seen in a long time, are for nought. 'Windtalkers' leaves its audience with only the vaguest idea of what the Navajo experience in WWII was like, and the odd impression that Cage's Sgt. Enders won the Saipan campaign almost singlehandedly. This one is for war movie geeks and John Woo fans only.",6,0,1,7 February 2008
Hustle & Flow," Character-driven drama spotlights Terrence Howard...
","...as an actor to watch, along with several of his supporting cast mates.Writer/director Craig 'Black Snake Moan' Brewer tells his hometown story with economy and conviction, rarely straying into Hollywood-ish excess. Aging pimp Djay (Howard), in the midst of a self-identified 'midlife crisis,' capitalizes on a chance encounter with homey Key (Anthony 'The Departed' Anderson) to pursue his dream of becoming a pro rapper. The outcome is unsurprising, given Djay's temperament and environment, but 'Hustle & Flow' draws its audience into Djay's sordid, dead-end world almost without effort, and actually makes that audience root for people they might not otherwise grant the time of day. Superior acting all the way around is provided by stars Howard, Anderson, Taraji 'Four Brothers' Henson, the very foxy Taryn 'Cold Mountain' Manning, Paula Jai 'The Proud Family' Parker, Elise 'All of Us' Neal, and DJ 'The Core' Qualls, along with actor/performers Isaac Hayes and a very effective Ludicrous as Skinny Black, the rap mogul that Djay pins his hopes of success on. All in all, a very impressive ensemble.Production costs were relatively low, but 'Hustle & Flow' looks great. Production design, art direction, and costuming are all flawless, placing the audience smack in the middle of Djay's world. Amy 'Black Snake Moan' Vincent's cinematography abjures showiness for solid storytelling, along with Billy 'Band of Brothers' Fox's editing. Scott 'Black Snake Moan' Bomar's music sets the appropriate tones, along with the ostensible Djay hit, 'Whoop That Trick.' There hardly seemed to be a false note in the entire production.A bit rough for delicate sensibilities, 'Hustle & Flow' delivers solid human characters caught up in the web of their own sins and proves them to be as worthy of our consideration as anyone else. Definitely worth a watch.",7,0,1,12 January 2007
