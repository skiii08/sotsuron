Black Swan," Not very good
","Like most modern Hollywood Films, this one was broken up, chopped up and hard to follow.This movie will never allow me to watch the Swan Lake Ballet again.Hollywood loves to pat itself on the back, and is really out of touch with reality.The film was Horrible. Grotesque, confusing, and bordered on disgusting.I am sorry, but I reach 21,000,000 on my TV show while the Tonight Show may reach 2 Million on a good day. I tell the truth, amazing.This movie was just a very, very bad film. The acting was superb, the plot line was horrible.How can you improve Holly Wood unless you know the truth? Yet you try try and reach a Hollywood person - forget it. They are surrounded by security and now, as a rule, are producing garbage. This is why TV and Movie viewer ship is way down.Wake up Hollywood.Dr. William B. Mount",1,7,13,3 March 2011
