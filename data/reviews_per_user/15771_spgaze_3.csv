Hereditary," Feels like the film I've been waiting years for.
","This film didn't stand out as one I was escited to see but a real difference of opinion conversation in a facebook group intrigued me. My expectations weren't high but WOW I absolutely loved this film and I know we'll all have different opinions and I love that but honestly don't understand how people don't love it!! Seriously mystified by some people giving it 1's. I don't give many ratings over 8 stars (especially with horrors) but this got a 9.
Loved It!!!!!",9,1,4,12 November 2018
No Country for Old Men," An unforgettable classic? - perhaps not but a very enjoyable movie
",I'm usually all for people having differing opinions and tastes and usually I'm respectful to that but I'm sorry those who are giving this 1 star are simply wrong. It's a film of fascinating characters and excellent performances beautifully coming together in a very good film by directors who I'm not usually a fan of,8,0,1,5 April 2019
Joker," Excellent film and performance
","Well Joaquim Pheonix went deep in this role Wow he was awesome, tragic but awesome. It will take a truly incredible performance for him not to get best actor at the oscars",9,1,2,22 October 2019
