The Blair Witch Project," The first movie to ever send chills through my body!
","After the disappointment of super-hyped-up summer movies like Austin Powers, Star Wars, and Eyes Wide Shut I was a little skeptical going into this one. But, wow!  I was sitting next to a friend of mine at the theatre and we were left sitting w/ our hands over our mouths at the end.  What a movie.  This is what I've been longing for.  Isn't it ironic that what I feel is perhaps one of the greatest movies ever made was done by two college film-school buddies, with their credit cards, with no-name actors, with no blood, special effects or violence, and with camcorders!  I'm tempted to never pay for a movie again.  Those characters were so real!  I found myself telling them to calm down and try to pull together, I wanted them to get out of there alive.  On the other hand, I wanted Love Hewitt to get slashed by that hook.  What a great idea these guys had.  I'll take them over James Cameron (Titanic, c'mon!) any day.",10,1,2,21 July 1999
