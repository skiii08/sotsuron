First Man," Wow.. I hope this isn't how Historical movies are portrayed from now on.
","If you are near sighted, like to view everything from 3 feet away and go through life with peripheral blinders on to understand your world, you might like this movie ---because this director doesn't know what a wide-angled lens is. If you feel the entire world around you should be viewed as emotionally depressing more than you seek to give a sense of triumph to mankind, you mike like this movie. If you feel all of the above then you will LOVE this director. This 'director' sits way atop the over-rated ones Hollywood spits out these days. 
Oh and.. they should put a Surgeon General's Warning on this director's ridiculous, 'gotta-be-different' just for the sake of 'being different' filming style, because if you suffer from epileptic seizures you won't like this movie. 
Best thing I can say about it: The sets, wardrobe, etc. are very authentic to the smallest detail. The worst thing I can say about this movie: It needed a different director, cinematographer and editor. ...oh, and script/writer(s). 
Neil Armstrong, American Heroes, NASA technological achievements, including the Lunar Landing are something to be celebrated by humanity and ESPECIALLY celebrated are the AMERICAN men and women at that time who made it all happen. This movie views it from the standpoint of filmmakers seemingly wanting to convey their own depressed, flawed view of humanity ahead of anything triumphant. Shame on them. I sure hope Neil Armstrong's family at least approved of this dismal take on an American Hero. Otherwise they should legally go after the makers of this film for wrongful defamation of character.",3,36,67,15 October 2018
It," Renewed my faith in moronic horror movies
","I never go to horror movies -- haven't seen one in over a decade -- because nearly every one of them is made by those lacking talent for an audience that lacks any understanding of what potential the horror genre is not living up to -- other than taking everyone's money. They are never scary, never frightening, never edge-of-your seat thrilling or any of the above -- OK, maybe if you're a 13 year old. I just don't comprehend what people see in so much garbage that is produced for this movie genre. There is so much potential for some great horror films, yet they are, time after time, so poorly made. A movie that truly gets into one's psyche and creeps you out -- I suppose that's my definition of a horror movie, but show me one that's been made that does that for anyone else than the teenage-mentality masses. That's because they don't know how to make them. I thought this one might be the exception -- because the trailer looked good. ...and that's where my compliments end --- The marketing was truly the most talented thing behind this movie, hence it's opening-weekend revenue. But don't let that fool you. It was boring, boring, boring. Nothing is thoroughly explained. The characters are unconvincing as it is overly acted in every scene, therefore horribly acted. Slow. boring. Not scary. A real snoozer.",3,24,48,12 September 2017
Bird Box," READY TO CATCH THE SYMBOLISM? ...THE VERY POINT OF THIS MOVIE IS PROVEN BY REVIEWERS WHO DON'T GET IT
","I read where this is turning into a smash hit as Netflix's largest download in the shortest time ---breaking streaming records, they're saying. Netflix's 'Bird Box' with Sandra Bullock. This movie makes you think.. That's what I like about it.After watching it, I definitely recommend it ---heck, I think they should show it to high school classes to teach our youth about how to prioritize what is important in life and how a society should protect itself from its own progressions. It reminds me a lot like 'The Lottery' by Shirley Jackson (1948) a short story that a lot of us were taught to read in high school ---how it opens of your eyes to humanity, how society behaves and what society does to itself without being aware of it. I especially recommend watching this movie with your significant other, as it will make you appreciate your loved ones, while thinking about humanity, where we're headed based on what we prioritize as important in life: Family, resisting those things that disconnect us. etc.. There is tons of symbolism in this movie.. especially with the sounds of birds, etc.. It's a psycho thriller (bloody and rated R) but with a VERY deep meaning behind it.To truly get the most out of it (and this is not giving away any spoilers here ---no more than what the synopsis summarizes) watch it with the idea of this: There are clues in the movie of humanity feeling 'disconnected.' Look for them. Think about what forces are causing this (I have my idea of what it is, do you?) and the multitude of problems with humanity that are on the rise from that disconnect, whether it be from a lack of family structure, or anything else you might guess. Think about what entities are there in our society that are so easily-influential on the masses? Think about what is causing a rise in things like psychotic behavior, suicides, loneliness. Think about what evil has the power to influence by merely making you look at it ...so as to try to influence you do so more ...where it acts to amplifies one's fears, create deeper sadness for that person, and then, ultimately, it influences one to destroy their own life in the process. Think of anything like this that is destroying humanity at alarming rates. Then imagine this thing being an actual, physical, more-obvious antagonist in this film, that, instead of slowly, literally causes people to kill themselves instantly in this film, just by looking at it.Now figure it out for yourself.. What is the evil demon in this movie?Enjoy!",8,1,4,29 December 2018
American Made," Very Entertaining --Cruise & Crew talent at its best
","Very entertaining. This movie was made with every one of its fibers to entertain. -- instead of just focusing on action shots alone to carry it like so many other lousy action movies do, this one has all the other qualities a 'real' movie has: Very well written, acted, camera work, the pace of it is perfect ---exciting through and through. Except for the jabs at my side of the political aisle--that was hard to see. Every administration (Dem or Rep) is guilty of so much behind-the-scenes poor decision making in our history. So I hope it doesn't turn anyone an opposite aisle. But this movie is truly a success because of it's main actor, Tom Cruise, What can I say?... At the same time I have no over-the-top stumbling over myself fondness to go see all his movies, those that I do go to it's so noticeable-- he just succeeds time after time in making fun to watch movies. His on screen presence (true talent) is tops in the industry. Every time you see Cruise in a movie it's not Oh there's Tom Cruise in this movie or that movie playing this/that person, but instead you lose yourself in the actual character he plays and you just sit back and enjoy the show. This is a sign of true talent, and Mr. Cruise has talent on screen and never fails. He is what a lifetime achievement award is made for --and will be handed to one day -- hopefully many, many years away. Hats off to him yet again, he works hard to entertain and he delivers every time. (although I haven't seen all of his movies -- those I don't care for the genre: i.e. mummies or vampires.. so I have no idea how he does in those.) Go see this movie! and leave your young kids at home.",8,1,2,4 October 2017
Lucy," Aside from it's weak points as a movie, reminds us we have nothing on the unknown powers of the Universe
","Numerous plot holes and very weak script aside, it's one of the most thought-provoking subjects in a movie I've seen in long while -- and on such an interesting subject --Us. We humans. What are we? What are we all about? That we only use 10% of our brain capacity is a myth, the science world has corrected this, and the movie jumps around the facts and talking points, but still this movie is good for raising so many questions, and to help one think outside of the only physical world we see with our eyes --and keep us thinking ---so it's amazing to explore that at least, through this movie. For those who can't recognize or appreciate the deeper-meaning side of such a subject, and only find brilliance in a movie filled with computer-aided phony action graphics run amuck, then stop right now. Your money will be better spent buying a ticket to Transformers or something and all of the brilliance in dialog and subject matter it contains. Nobody will hold it against you. We ARE still evolving after all.",7,5,16,29 July 2014
Annihilation," Wow.. I didn't walk out because I couldn't believe it would stay that bad. It does.
","Absolute garbage. Poor story development, plot development, character development. Dark and dull. Poor acting, poor directing. Horrible and uninspiring dialogue that a 5-five year old child could write because all they say is, 'I don't know.' which convinces me the writers were all pot smokers and heroin addicts. I also don't remember a movie with so few cast members in it either. What lazy joke of a production. And the writers.. seriously.. where this story leads you .. The writers just need to stay off the drugs. Even the sound editors annoyed me as they nearly blew out my eardrums at the end. ..which makes it not only a forgettable and regrettable experience to waste your time, but an experience that physically harms you with it's effects. Lawsuit anyone?",1,47,102,13 March 2018
