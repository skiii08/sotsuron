The Blair Witch Project," Utter Disappointment
","It is a shame to see what kind of movies are considered horror movies in the 90's. (spoiler) this is a film about 3 college students that have absolutely no idea what to do while lost in the woods. They spend 90% of their time arguing and the rest of the time fighting. There is nothing scary about this movie other than so many people think it is a true story. The only good thing about this movie is a million parents are going to send there children to boy scouts now, in case they get lost in the forest",1,1,3,17 November 1999
Dawn of the Dead," Awful! Did ANYONE actually watch this?
","I have to say up front that I am a huge fan of the horror movies. They have been and always will be my favorite form of movies. Unfortunately, This was a comedy and not a horror. SPOILERS: Let me remind you of a few jokes about this film before you can say that it was at all good. 1) Why were some people that were bitten turned into zombies after 5 minutes yet others after a couple days? 2) Why is it that when they went into the garage to turn on the breakers they were chased by zombies that could get in, but while working on their tanks....I mean buses there was not a zombie in sight? 3)When leaving the mall wasnt it at all kinda funny that they are surrounded by atleast 2000 zombies, then they throw a propane tank that lands 5 feet away from the bus that explodes into a thermo nuclear bomb that kills all the zombies within a 100 yards but the bus is left unscathed? 4) Did I mention that they turned 2 buses into tanks in a matter of a day or 2? 5) How and why did the girl go to the gun shop across the street when she saw her dog was fine? Also how did she manage to get downstairs and into the truck in a matter of 30 secs? By the way, werent they saying getting to the truck would be impossible yet a 14 year old did it. hmmm. These are just a handful of jokes that i found amusing while watching this film. I think overall the film was terrible, plot was a joke, and if I had a chance to watch this or zombie lake it would be a real tough toss up. 1 out of 10 stars and thats just cause a few of the original characters were featured in the film.",1,8,16,20 March 2004
A Night at the Roxbury," Unforgettable
","This is a excellent film filled with comedy and adventure. It received bad reviews and i can understand why. It is a crazy goofy film about 2 brothers that spend their lives at clubs trying to pick up chicks. They share a unique comedy that not many actors possess. If you enjoy their skits on Saturday Night Live or Have a very open mind, This is a film for you. If you are looking for a comedy from serious actors. this film may not be what you are looking for",10,3,3,18 November 1999
