The Benchwarmers," Worthy of all 2006 Razzies and Stinkers awards. (spoilers)
","I honestly didn't think there could be anything more lacking in entertainment and humor than 'You Me and Dupree' until I saw 'The Benchwarmers.' Struggling to produce an over-the-top comedy, this laugh-less comedy only gets by on Stone & Parker (but light)-styled gross out humor as possible to compensate for the stupid story about the nerd population's ultimate revenge over their bullies: a semi-little league baseball championship. Did 13 year-old comic book geeks write this lame material? In this nonsense story, Rob Schneider takes the lead in a more serious version of his well-meaning Deuce Bigalow role. He is somehow talked into starting up a baseball team called 'The Benchwarmers,' a trio consisting of him, David Spade, and Jon Heder (repeating once again, in very weak form, his Napoleon Dynamite character). They come to represent the nerds because basically, each of them gets picked on by pre-teen brats and their coaches who challenge them to a game. Soon enough, they mark their fandom among the nerds as heroes, and Jon Lovitz as some multi-billionaire promoter shows up with all his gadgets and promotes the team. The winner of the baseball championship is given a free state-of-the-art stadium. Even I love stupid humor comedy, but a stupid story coupled with terrible acting (way to deliver those lines like you're reading from the script, gang), and dumb jokes, this is, if not the worst movie ever, than certainly the worst movie produced all year.",1,10,21,31 July 2006
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Great costumes highlight this desert road trip. (spoilers)
","For some reason, I had the premonition that the Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert was a sort of lavish fantasy tale set in the desert. Like a drag queen version of Alice in Wonderland or something like that, and particularly it was the outrageous (but spectacular) costumes which had me thinking this, in addition to never having seen the previews. This is the story of two drag queen friends (Hugo Weaving and Guy Pierce) and their transsexual friend (Terrence Stamp) who get the idea to travel to some isolate town in Australia and perform at a hotel in a cabaret show. Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, refers to their vintage bus which takes the trio to an odd assortment of locations along the way with its irritating knack for frequently breaking down. In a way, this is a typical sort of road trip film of friends bonding over harder soul-searching moments, particularly among Bernie (Stamp) who recently lost his companion and Mitzi (Weaving) who is summoned to this little town by his wife who asks for his help with 'something.' In a sort of way of painting the town red, the trio do tend to light up the bland and almost alien life with their outrageous costumes (and it seems that the actors change clothes in nearly every scene) and disco-days performances, awing some and angering others and it seems those who are the most understanding are those who themselves at some point have been ostracized.It is a great film that offers a lot of laugh and the sort of wit so familiar to comedies such as these. I thought it was ridiculous to place the costume designer on one of those idiotic 'Worst Dressed' lists for her credit-card dress design, considering it complimented the art direction of this film quite nicely. These were by far some of the best costumes on film.",8,1,3,14 May 2006
Howl's Moving Castle," A wonderfully original story. Had it not been for the sappy ending, I would rate it a perfect ten! (spoilers)
","'Howls Moving Castle' is one of my favorite animated feature films. I wasn't as impressed with Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away and have yet to see any of his other feature films. But this one, however, has great characters, a sense of humor, a unique plot, and would have been perfect in my book had it not been for a the sappy ending in which everything is easily and predictability resolved Walt Disney style. This being the same unfortunate state that marred another one of my favorites, Garden State.'Howl's Moving Castle' refers to just that, a floating contraption which looks like an island conglomeration of houses and trees which move around on robotic legs and emit plenty of pollution. Our main character is not actually Howl, but a young girl who befriends Howl, but through a curse, is turned into an old woman. Trying to figure out how to restore herself, she finds work in the Moving Castle as a maid where she befriends it's few residents--a young boy, a ball of fire (or rather, the igniting soul of a fire, and the mysterious Howl. In the meantime, she likewise becomes involved with Howl's participation in an ongoing war. The plot by this point becomes slightly complicated to explain without giving too much away only because several other characters enter the story, imposing a few more subplots.The beauty of this film is, unlike other animated features, not wonderful by any means for the animated style. For the most part, if you've seen one Japanimated cartoon these days, you've seen them all in their inglorious, standardized form. And perhaps, this is where Hayao Miyazaki and his film-making team should experiment with new styles and approaches. Instead, the beauty of the film, at least for me, is largely due to such a unique and engaging story. I am normally not a fan of this genre, but I really enjoyed this particular one.",8,1,2,10 July 2005
Miracle," Yet another feel-good 'determined coach/athlete' drama from Disney. (spoilers)
","Released in 2004, Miracle was probably quickly turned out in response to Hollywood's almost-compulsive need for ultra-patriotic feel-good movies. For Disney, they never seem to get tired of the story of the determined coach, athlete, and team drama, since they have been producing almost one a year (with previous ones being Rookie, and, among one of the better ones--Meet the Titans). This one is based on Herb Brooks, a former Olympic hopeful for the US hockey team who is now coaching a new team of potential Olympic hopefuls for the US team who is set to challenge the Russian in the Cold-War era (this centering on the 1980 Olympics).A major problem with this film, despite it being ritual at this point, is the pacing. I'm not sure whether it was the intention of the filmmakers to focus solely on the dynamics of Herb Brooks, who patiently tries to piece together a sound team of players, or whether it was the intention to focus on the work of the entire team who eventually went on to defeat the Russians. If it was the latter, than the pacing killed it. Even despite the little individual dramas that arise among the players, almost none of it is given much interesting detail. Almost none of it is really entertaining or meaningful. It is just kind of like...here is player X, you will know him because of this characteristic. We never really get much understanding of how the players were dynamic in and of themselves as though filmmakers were reluctant to add more detail beyond the making of Herb Brooks's character. The result of this being, a movie about an important figure in sports history (at least by the understanding of the filmmakers who chose to make a film about Brooks) that is intertwined with all of these other really unimportant people and even more standardized moments of hockey action.The almost mundane portrayal of the historical importance of Herb Brooks is the result of far too much standardization. The consequence of Hollywood's inability to depart from convention.",3,1,10,30 March 2006
50 First Dates," Typical Sandler Material, But Pleasant Comedy (spoilers)
","'50 First Dates' is Sandler in his typical innocuous role just as he has in nearly every role he's been in since he started making movies. But, this one, probably because of an unusual love story and a decent supporting cast, is much better than his recent mediocre fare which includes 'Mr. Deeds,' 'Eight Crazy Nights,' and 'Anger Management,' three of the most mundane comedies I've ever seen.Adam Sandler is Henry Roth, a veternarian who initially appears to be a real jerk. The introduction features several women sharing with their girlfriends about a romantic fling they had during their vacations, all with the same guy: Henry Roth; a guy who hates commitment. All that changes for Henry when he meets Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore) at a local cafe. Unfortunately, the one girl he's really fallen in love with turns out to have no short-term memory. Her brain damage is a result of a car accident and she can't make any new memories. So, every day she gets up thinking it's exactly the same day that it was when she had the accident. Hence the title, '50 First Dates.' The story is very reminiscint of 'Groundhog Day,' in that the same situation is repeated over and over again. Except, Lucy doesn't know that she'll be reliving that same day again and again. And although her father (Blake Clark) and brother (Doug) always try to recreate the same day for her--her father's birthday, the last day she remembers--Henry wants to make the most of the day for Lucy, starting every day by telling Lucy about her accident, and essentially, spend time with her for the rest of the day. Henry Roth really falls in love with this girl, so it's a matter of is he going to be doing this for the rest of his life since the people at the institute have basically declared her condition incurable? It's a pleasant comedy and makes for an interesting love story, although at times a pretty sad one because Lucy is basically being told every day about her accident and the passage of time and so forth. It works, I suppose, because Sandler and Barrymore are pretty much in the same character roles they've been doing for a long time. I'm sure the audience's favorite, on the other hand, was the kooky character, Ulo, that Sandler's faithful co-star, Rob Schneider plays, delivering many of the laughs in this film.
The story and characters are a formulaic arrangement of previous Sandler comedies. The strange friend (here, a hermaphrodite) with eerie suggestions and confusing sexual innuendos; old characters who say the damnedest things; and so forth. If you liked 'The Wedding Singer,' chances are, you'll enjoy this one even if you haven't been too pleased with previous Sandler comedies. I wonder if he's ever going to be able to get away from comedies like these and still be funny, especially when he gets older.",5,2,4,6 June 2004
The Ring," What was the big deal with this movie?
","My school had a free screening of this movie one year, so I took advantage of it. I don't have high expectations of recently released horror movies, so if an opportunity arises where I don't have to waste money to see it, I'll take it. 'The Ring' was a major disappointment. As everyone probably knows, the story involves a videocassette that brings death upon it's viewers, who will recieve a phone call. Bottom line: don't pick up the telephone. Actually the movie makes for a good prank if you have friends watching this movie and then dial their phone while they're in the middle of seeing it. Will they answer it or won't they? I never found this movie to be scary and I blame it on one too many cheap scare tactics. At one point the story gets so ridiculous in trying to find out who the person is on the tape that I was expecting them to say the horse did it. It also doesn't add to the suspense when people in the theater are forcing their screams at nearly every (even subtle) little surprise in the movie. Now, normally, I love a good horror film, even if it is recently released, so long as I liked it. But this movie was just too overrated for what it was, probably trying to cash in on some of the fright fest exploits of the Blair Witch Project. They're not the same movie, but their scare tactics are similar at points. I say, if you're an easy scare when it comes to horror movies, then you'll probably go nuts with this production. But otherwise, I think it is a like it or hate it movie.",3,1,4,4 April 2004
The Rookie," Disney strikes out again. (spoilers)
","Once again Disney has been pulling at straws trying to make another Blockbuster hit (having only recently succeeded with Finding Nemo, it seems, and being unable to match it). Dennis Quaid plays Jimmy Morris, a high school baseball coach out of Texas who makes a wager with his team. Win the championship and he'll try out for the majors (making more of this promise to his son than his team). We see him float around from one dive team to another (and getting equally discouraged by his disuading wife and father) before finally being called up for his shot at the majors. Suddenly, this middle aged man, who dropped out of the minors years ago due to a shoulder injury, is playing top notch for the majors. It is based on a true story, but when Disney thought it would be great to spend big bucks on the story, they should've thought about really developing the story into something entertaining. Despite the true tales of Jim Morris, this movie really lacks a story, or at least an effective delivery if you want to pay tribute to this guy and his 'amazing feat'. Sure, we see this guy struggling as he gets traded around before finally making it to the majors, encouraging audiences members to remember one thing: stick with your dreams and give it your all through even the most difficult moments if you expect to succeed. However, this movie isn't really entertaining since Jim Morris's character doesn't really do much. Even the baseball action isn't that hot. We just seem more of one guy traveling from one team to the next and not much else. Plus, the movie is just too long.If it's baseball movies that suit you, then there are plenty of good titles out there (the classics: Field of Dreams; Bill Durham; The Sandlot; League of Their Own; etc.). The Rookie is just plain and simple overrated.",Null,0,2,13 August 2004
Lords of Dogtown," Unnecessarily redundant: the legend askew. (spoilers)
","You have two ways of learning about the early history and transformation of skateboarding from kiddie fad to extreme commercial success. That is, through former Z-Boy Stacey Peralta's stylish documentary released in 2002, or through the 2005 fictionalized Hollywood mainstream feature inspired by the events (and directed by 'Thirteen' director Catherine Hardwicke and written by Peralta).While I thoroughly enjoyed the former, I was quite disappointed with the latter. And, the argument that it can only be appreciated and understood by the most hardcore of skaters is completely stupid. You don't have to skate well (or at all) to enjoy a good skate movie. Unfortunately, unlike Peralta's fantastic documentary, Dogtown and Z-Boys, this fictionalized 'legend' paid little homage to the sport itself and the Zephyr team (beyond just Peralta, Alva, and Adams). Lords of Dogtown, without context and with such annoyingly abrupt and disoriented storytelling almost makes it like Stacey Peralta, Tony Alva, and Jay Adams invented skateboarding. Dogtown, the sacred skater tale turned mainstream, has been given a Hollywood polish, establishing a mythical celebration of personal arrogance rather than honest insight for the team and the sport. And that leaves little to distinguish it from other Hollywood productions. Instead, there was little focus on how these teenagers love of skating completely revolutionized the skateboarding in ways that relieved it of a tired 1960s paradigm and transforming and laying the foundation for primitive technology with the most intense performance (not to mention a substantial commercial success even to this day). This this legend is told slightly askew. Above all else (and I believe this was due to legal problems), critical founders of the team as well as members of the team themselves were omitted entirely. You're just watching the Embloom, Adams, Alva, and Perlata show the whole time. Jeff Ho, cofounder of Zephyr surf shop, was absent. As were team riders Paul Constantineau, Nathan Pratt, and others seen in the documentary (although, I can see why Chris Cahill was out). Bob Biniak was a tremendous skater in his day. As was Shogo. Where were they? (Granted, Shogo has about a two-second scene).Likewise, the events in the story appear to move too fast and in such a scattered manner, dwarfing their true impact on the changes that skateboarding would undergo. The viewer is never really given time to digest it, or actually, to appreciate what it was about the Z-boyz style of skating that was so important when reviewing the sport. The skateboarding contest was ridiculous and rather condescending, if not simply exaggerated. Watching this movie was as though you watched the documentary and pulled pieces from it which were to be given greater anecdotal backstory such as Skip Embloom's obnoxious presence at the Del Mar contests, Jay Adam's wild nature (only they thought to reference this at unusual points of the film), or Sid, the young man who died of brain cancer who's Dog Bowl swimming pool sessions in the last moments of his life were credited for reuniting the Z-Boyz for a few last runs (although the documentary features more than just the same three skaters skating in these sessions). But like everything else, nothing was told in a way fully developed enough to give the viewer some sense of order, never mind some sense of appreciation of what the stories of Dogtown. The film actually tries to duplicates sections of the documentary, as well, including the soundtrack ('Old man look at my life...' plays when Jay scores poorly at what appears to be his last contest; Ted Nugent's 'Cat Scratch Fever' cues at the contest). What was the purpose for trying to duplicate what was already a finely crafted documentary? I can't help but to look at this as an exhaustive attempt to praise Alva, Adams, and Peralta, or the Dogtown in general because people could be satisfied with the documentary alone as well-made as it was. Instead, some have found an opportunity to cash in even further on the fact that now the mainstream not only knows the story, but now knows the name of those most recognized from the team (and Engbloom, but only because of Heath Ledger being cast in the film).Aside from shoddy story telling, the acting wasn't great. Victor Rasauk was a miscast. Emille Hirsch never fully captures Jay Adams as the rambunctious pre-fame youngster and spent most of the film giving his trademark distant stares, regardless of mood changes. John Robinson did alright as Peralta, probably because Perlata himself was able to coach him. My biggest complaint with casting is that they should've hired actual skaters to play the parts rather than succumb to the marketing potential of the pre-teen crowd. (The names are obviously a draw, cashing in on the pret-teen girl market). Although, the skating sequences were nice enough to make you want to grab a board and go out and dig up old snake runs.If you are in the mood for a Dogtown tale because it is about skateboarding first and foremost, you would do best to capture the history in it's most stylish and honorable form in Peralta's documentary, Dogtown and Z-Boys.",3,73,153,30 July 2005
The Girl Next Door," Bland 'Risky Business' Rip-off. (SPOILERS)
","The a variation on other popular 80s teen films, The Girl Next Door is 2004's answer to Risky Business (not only does the story model it, but there are many subtle references to it), only the latter proved to be a much better movie.Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is much like Joel Goodsen. He's a smart kid who follows the rules, but once he's willing to test his limits, he shares in many crazy adventures. Like Joel, these adventures get him into a world of trouble. However, unlike Joel, Matthew is more of a 'geek' by today's standards. He's student council president (although I thought that was an honor awarded through a popularity contest), slated for a future at an Ivy League School, and has two equally unadventurous friends. He thinks his adventures will come from hanging out with the popular kids, but instead, it comes from a chance meeting with The Girl Next Door. On the other hand, Joel was never really an unpopular kid, and didn't aspire to be on of the in-group, either. He was just one guy who had to test the rules and be willing to take chances to have some fun.Although it is a variation on 'Risky Business,' The Girl Next Door is catering to modern standards of parental safety. Even though it earned an 'R' rating in the U.S., there are is no real nudity, and surprisingly, no references to drug use. But more importantly, The Girl Next Door is not a prostitute, instead catering to the hormonal raging teen audiences (especially male audience) with a safer version of the promiscuous girl. Whereas the girl in Risky Business was a prostitute, here, she is merely a porn star.So, when Matthew meets Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert), his new next door neighbor for the time being, she shows him some good times, trying to get him to toss out his inhibitions. They have good times together. But about the point that Matthew's friend (this film's equivalent to Miles), Eli, tells him that the pretty girl next door is actually an adult film star, the movie becomes far too ludicrous and starts to fall apart.First is the tired fantasy of young men in today's films that they will suddenly meet a girl of a promiscuous profession, the same aspirations of Kenny Fisher in Can't Hardly Wait, of the entire gang in American Pie, and so forth. It is really a boring story line that today's films can't seem to do much with, let alone leave it out of the movie altogether. Here, it becomes even more ridiculous. For Matthew, it leads to a confrontation between Matthew and Danielle's former producer (Timothy Olyphant) who has big investments riding on Danielle's performances. But, these hefty investments fall through when Danielle decides to give up the trade on Matthew's urging that she's better than that, Kelly (the producer) comes looking for Matthew. He steals the money Matthew has invested for a Cambodian exchange student and meddles in an important speech he must give for a Georgetown Scholarship. Actually, we can once again see the safety of this movie, since Guido 'The Killer Pimp' was a much more dangerous adversary in 'Risky Business' (even going so far as to shoot at Joel as he is driving away from the restaurant in the chase scene). The movie wavers between the boring and ludicrous as Matt starts to get into more trouble than he can bare, needing a plan to make fast cash. So, fulfilling the male teen fantasy is all this movie hopes to do (playing out more like a wet dream than a movie...notice the fascination with proving male worthy by size of penis in the finale when Klitz's friends are watching his part in the movie they make) when Matt and his friends use some of Danielle's connections to create a porno film on the night of their prom. This is about the point when you can just throw you hands up and forget about expecting anything good to come out of this cop out ending. Blah...blah...blah, Kelly tries to put a stop to it (how he knew about the movie or got his hands on the tape is something the writer's never bother to clue us in on) and threatens to show it to Matthews parents who are happy with it (you'll see why), everyone is happy in the end, and it works out better than expected. In Risky Business, on the other hand, nothing was ever as so much in-your-face as it is here. Here, the movie is riddled with stereotypes and conventional teen movie elements: the popular crowd of horny guys and easy girls; the exceptionally horny and stupid friend (Eli); and the wholly stupid situation that will help them solve all of their woes (the sex movie). With Risky Business, Joel and his friends weren't horny morons that craved to be part of the in-crowd. Joel just wanted to be with a beautiful girl, and he got what he asked for. Except in dealing with a prostitute, you had more reason to believe that Joel's adversary would be a violent one (as compared to say, Kelly, the porno producer who likely has ample opportunity to make other money, but wastes all his time on a high school kid). The problems that Joel confronts are more suspenseful (getting suspended from school, getting kicked off a student project, having his dad's car fall in a lake, getting robbed, and blowing his college admissions interview).Here, Matthew screws up his speech for Georgetown and is robbed of 25 grand in an impossible situation (you need two signatures and proof of identification to clear out an account that big...i doubt even a charmed teller would let that slide if she was so worried about her job afterwards). The whole movie just becomes so utterly stupid. Best you save your time for 'Risky Business.'",Null,0,0,22 May 2004
Coffee and Cigarettes," Pretentious art-house drivel.
","Jim Jarmush directs this series of collected shorts about coffeehouse patrons. I was looking forward to this one, but came away from it very disappointed. I'm a little tired of movies which are celebrated by critics as profound cinema, but what I actually find to be nothing more than pretentious art-house drivel, striving to be profound. And true, some of the sequences in Coffe and Cigarettes are funny, and sometimes interesting (the Jack/Meg White thing was amusing), but overall, no one talks about anything remotely interesting.While I thought the cinematography was done quite nicely, this kinds of subject matter things worked well in the 60s simply because they were something different, but have little effect today because everyone just thinks they're being profound for the sake of profound when, in reality, it is nothing more than nonsense. I don't care about one sequence after another of people in coffeeshops yabbering on about coffee and cigarettes and any other meaningless bits of conversation (I know, that's the point). And, after recently watching 'Slacker,' I'm not sure I can take much more of it. (Although, the only time I really enjoyed it was with 'Night on Earth,' which was ironic comedy).Although, I may be the atypical reaction. I'm not sure. I definitely can't say how others will feel about this. Obviously, indy fans and those who don't mind movies without a distinct plot may be willing to give it a try. As for fans of other Jarmush movies, I don't know what your reaction might be to this.",4,3,8,8 January 2005
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," There's many fine obscentities to describe how lame this movie was. (spoilers)
","This movie, save one too many sexual innuendos, could just as well have been made in the bland 1950s era. Hollywood has churned out yet another boilerplate romance comedy with the leads playing their usual charming, but secretly altruistic (at least a secret to each other) characters who make a wager with friends that they, the self-appointed Casanovas, will be able to lure the other into a false relationship and get what they want out of it. And oh! What a coincidence, they actually wind up finding out that they're perfect together and fall in love, immediately torn apart when each discovers the other's initially fraudulent motives, before dismissing that for the sake of their love for each other. **Yawn!**Unfortunate for the viewers, not only does Hollywood (who keeps scratching their heads at plummeting box office figures) never get tired of making these movies (which do date back to the cinematic age of our grandparents who might've only enjoyed it then for the sake of the novelty of seeing movies), they also never add much of anything new. If you're in the mood for your standard romantic comedy gender war, then this one will probably suit you. If you've seen one, however, you've probably seen them all (at least within the mainstream).",3,1,2,20 July 2005
Chicken Run," Have you ever seen a bad Nick Park movie? I didn't think so.
","'Chicken Run' probably gave Nick Park his long overdue credit as an extremely talented writer and director. And, with its extreme blockbuster success, we Yanks were finally able to find Nick Park's other films, such as the Wallace and Gromit short animated features, in regular release on the store and rental shelves.This movie puts us right in the middle of a rural English chicken coup where Ginger, the unofficial leader of the hens, has been trying rather unsuccessfully to break she and her fellow chickens out of their prison, always rebuffed by either failed techniques or babbling Mr. Tweedy and his vicious watchdogs. But, fate seems to work in their favor when, at Ginger's near breaking point, Rocky the 'flying' rooster, a circus fugitive, lands in their chicken coup. In order to avoid his cover being blown (no one here but us chickens!), he convinces the hens that he really is a flying rooster. Of course, his little white lie has serious repercussion as, for their last resort, Ginger wants Rocky to teach the hens to fly, as they would finally be able to escape their incarceration in the coup.Of course, the hens must come up with a successful plan fast because, meanwhile, evil chicken farmer, Mrs. Tweedy, sick and tired of making minuscule profits, decides to turn her farm into a goldmine. Rather than worrying about egg production, she intends to fatten up her poultry darlings and turn them into chicken pies. Chickens go in, pies come out! I adore this movie most of all for its simplistic, but creative fashion of establishing its setting. The chicken coup is made to seem like a prison with the initial goal for the hens being a successful breakout. The Tweedys act as their wardens. And, as punishment for fugitive escapees--solitary confinement (or, to absent minded hens, 'holiday). Every little detail is worked into the story. Second, like all Nick Park, is the pleasure of a strange, but hilarious assortment of heroes and villains such as bubbly Babs (my favorite), braniac Mac ('I swear she ain't speaking English'), and the old-timer, Fowler. Nick Park has certainly nearly perfected the arrangement of all things to make such perfectly creative, absolutely hilarious feature film and short comedies in ways I have usually seen with Tim Burton's early movies (especially Edward Scissorhands and Nightmare Before Christmas). I have yet to see him make a poor film.And, after this movie, you may never again want to eat chicken. (Or, at least until you've forgotten about the movie).",9,2,2,27 January 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," A dazzling dud. (spoilers)
","'The Day After Tomorrow' does have a significant message: be kind to mother nature, but it sacrificed the importance of showing this by instead focusing on big-budget special effects and your typical, end-of-the-world family reconnecting plot (that of Jack and Sam). The movie doesn't do enough to show causation (maybe in the beginning, introducing people around the world engage in what seem like daily activities...but those that obviously harm the environment because they're done dangerously and excessively). It also seemed to lighten up by making the final effects of the storm only mild. Sure, you can ice skate on the northern hemisphere, but it'll be fine in a few days. And look, everyone who got to Mexico is alright now. It's not a pretty picture, but they should've really shown the severity of what could really happen.Dennis Quaid stars as Jack, a climatologist, a fellow who's traveled around the world with his crew obviously studying changes in the climate. While at a press conference, he urges world leaders to take long-term action to reduce the activities that adding to global warming. The polar ice caps are melting and mixing too much fresh water into the North Atlantic current, which is what shifts warmer weather out across the globe. When it can't, obviously, things are going to freeze and mother nature is going to raise some hell. Of course, the only country who seems reluctant to do anything, arguing for economy's sake, is the American vice president, who won't take the time to brief the President on Jack's report and explain to the people the emergency they face and the policies that need to be in place to avoid it, or at least minimize the possible damage. Of course, the right wing politicians in this country were upset about that. Why not? They're still calling global warming a myth. And it's no surprise, what with politician's connections to oil and gas companies. Is it a wonder America is behind everyone else on environmental issues? No.Then, they have that stupid family element in the story which overtakes everything else. It obscures the importance of the movie with this dumb human interest story. Jack's son Sam is headed to New York on some sort of Academic decathelon fieldtrip. He gets trapped there when the storms erupt sooner than Jack and everyone else ever predicted. The storms come fast and they come hard. We see Los Angeles ripped apart by five or six massive tornados. Scotland turns into a giant block of ice almost immediately. And in Japan, blocks of ice the size of tether balls rain down on the city. Most of the story takes place in New York where Sam is. We see little of the effects, other than those mentioned above, which occur around the rest of the world (that's the problem with this stupid human interest element and why it turns it into every other end-of-the-world movie). New York gets flooded, then it snows, and then it freezes. The whole world seems to disappear while Sam and the few survivors wait things out on the top floor of the New York public library. And Jack is determined to get to his son via the Postman's code. Nor rain nor sleet nor snow--Jack's gonna get to Sam. And of course, he defies all laws of physics to do it. The movie should've made the message much clearer, showing all aspects of it as cause and effect. Show the things people do every day that are causing destruction. Make people second guess what it is they're doing and how necessary it is to change these simple things (recycle or die). If they're going to have a human interest story, it shouldn't have taken the priority over everything else. Watching the Jack and Sam saga for nearly three hours is actually kind of boring, much less aggravating. And as such, it fell to the formula.",2,1,3,31 July 2004
Hotel Rwanda," This IS the Best Picture of 2004 (spoilers)
","As governments around the world ignore the atrocities against the Sudanese in Darfur, this movie should have you screaming for something to be done to save them! 'The Hotel Rwanda' should be seen by all, and forgotten by none. 'The Hotel Rwanda' is a familiar favorite among Best Picture contenders, more than humbling an audience with biographical tales of heroic struggles against disgusting atrocities. 'The Pianist' and 'Schindler's List' are more recent examples of this. But, with 'The Hotel Rwanda,' the intensity delivered by director Terry George and the powerful performance by Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina, this film was able to put the shock into people in a much more disturbing and intense way than I had ever seen any other movie do and leaves you silent and just as helpless long after you've left the theater.The Hotel Rwanda refers to the Belgium hotel that, under Rusesabagina's unexpected direction, served as a refugee camp for the Tutsi people who were being wiped out by Hutsi rebels in Rwanda. On the one hand, this movie shows you the kind of atrocities that could result if one faction controlled the media (the Hutsi's here controlled the radio waves and incited their violence and recruited their followers through a propaganda radio program). On the other hand, Rusesabagina is such an extraordinary heroic figure where he tried desperately to save people from the slaughter when it seems that every government that could help denied assistance to the Rwandas. Even where journalists were able to enter the country before the worst fighting began and report the massacre. We ought to be made aware of these things, and we should never ignore them, and never forget them.I am still amazed by the powerful emotion that this movie is able to invoke, to nearly lose your mind in desperation when it seems like there is going to be no hope left for Paul, his family, or the Rwandan refugees. To become nearly violent when anger when you their holocaust, but the other countries refuse to help.And, actress Sophie Okonedo, who plays Tatiana Rusesabagina, likewise gives an incredible performance as Paul's wife. This IS the Best Picture of 2004.",10,5,8,5 March 2005
10 Things I Hate About You," Funny, she doesn't look Shrewish.
","I was surprised with this movie. Finally, a modern teen movie of some merit, not all the obnoxious themes and insipid story lines. I wouldn't mind, however, seeing a teen movie in which the characters don't live in massive upper-middle class homes and attend schools that span a city. Can't the folks in these movies just survive without a Rob Reiner-esque neighborhood?
While so many reviews have been posted already, there's no point in going into much detail about the plot, as it does get quite involved. Based on Shakespear's Taming of the Shrew, the movie is a romantic comedy about hard lessons learned by it's young characters. Appearances aren't always everything, you know. It is quite a sincere movie, actually showing intelligent teenagers working out their own kinks while in search of true love, and not boggled down by two hours of simply trying to get laid (though that may be Joey Donner's (Andrew Keegan) sole motive for living).
It's quite a funny movie that introduced me to both Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger. Levitt, Oleynik, Keegan, and Krumholtz have been performing since they were kids. Since this movie, I find it interesting that Stiles has appeared in quite a few other Shakespeare adaptations. Nonetheless, the movie has a lot of fresh faces, a good soundtrack (if only they put that techno song just before the real party starts at Bogie's on the CD).
Anyways, it's a movie that is well worth seeing, especially when you've had enough servings of your crap teen comedies these days.",8,0,0,13 April 2004
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Struggles to be important. (minor spoilers)
","Good Morning Vietnam is the Hollywood clean version of the Vietnam war. The movie is set in 1965, the first year of the declared war on Vietnam. However, we are looking at the 1980s white-washed version of the war and Vietnam itself during American occupation, which was typical to the decade in seeking to compensate for a war lost (also see Rambo).
1965 may've been the start of the declared war, but Vietnam was a country in military struggle for most of it's existence. Just having fought a war with the French, I doubt that even the South Vietnamese setting was so peaceful and pleasant (though economically ravaged) as this movie shows you. But unfortunately, I suppose it would have to, in order to draw your attention to the story--the battle of the airwaves.Robin Williams plays Adrian Cronauer, an air force transferee who gets assigned to the local radio broadcasting station in Saigon. He is central to the movie's attempt at being defiant. But defiant against what? The war? Unruly authority? Given the way the story fluctuates and the various importance on several characters (not just Williams's character), it's hard to tell. Cronauer's unusual broadcasting personality makes him popular against the soldiers in the field, but he is a thorn in the side of his superiors, Steven Hauk (Bruno Kirby) and Phillip Dickerson (JT Walsh) who prefer he stick to format. Cronauer is a hit with his monologues and rock n' roll hour. He's a pretty tough character, not caring much about the threats from Hauk and Dickerson, knowing that he's doing something good for the soldiers at least, who seem to enjoy it. He tests the waters with his commanding officers, however, when he tries to read the censored news bulletins on aired, hoping to remove the illusion of a 'happy' war. But, even here, it doesn't seem like Cronauer is much of a character that stands out as a defiant one, and it looks like his actions had absolutely no effect on the soldier or anything like that (at least as far as the movie shows you). So where they were going with this aspect of the plot is pretty unclear (or perhaps, unfinished).This is typical Robin Williams comedy, let loose for quite a few minutes at a time to splurge on semi-humorous monologues (at least when he doesn't do his impersonations so fast that you can't discern what he's saying). It is funny at moments, but most of the jokes are pretty stupid. It is nothing exciting, nor particularly engaging (though he does have some funny dialogue when it comes from the script). The more interesting secondary characters such as Forrest Whitakker are hardly developed in any sort of interest at all, and probably would've been necessary anyway to get some direction for this damned story and from the central character. This is not one movie that I really enjoyed with some exception, and I fail to see what the big fuss is about it after all these years.",Null,1,3,5 July 2004
Little Miss Sunshine," Casting sunshine upon life's poignant miseries. (spoilers)
","There are several films which pompously proclaim to be the 'cultural event of the decade' (Pirates of the Caribbean 2) or the movie that 'defines a generation' (Step Up). And, amidst another year of, it seems, one horrible Hollywood production after another, Little Miss Sunshine stands out. It is one of the best films to be produced for the mainstream this year. A subjective opinion, sure, but it has been a long time since a theater audience has been so diverse and more importantly, reactive, in their movie-going experience, generating laughs throughout the film and at the end, applause.Little Miss Sunshine should also be commended for a willingness to break free of much of the cookie cutter style of film-making that much of Hollywood (and a large sector of the independent sphere) has been reduced to these days, spitting out one piece of nonsense after the next. It does take a common theme -- that of a world trying so hard to sustain this outrageous semblance of 'normal' and 'perfection' that it seems that tragedy is inevitable for all who are unable to live up to its standards. Normal and perfection is a myth. And this has been repeated ad nausea in depressing dramas like 'Imaginary Heroes' and 'The Ice Storm,' among others (why always set this theme in the 1970s when it clearly applies to today?). But, rather than deliver another story of depressing and relentless misery upon our characters, this film offers an opportunity to laugh at everything about it even in the slightest details even though things never seem to bid well for our characters. It seems to approach things with more humor and light-heartedness, too, than say 'Welcome to the Dollhouse' which is really a sad form of mockery in that it will make you laugh only because the characters are so off-the-wall. But that's wherein their humor lies--as an oddity. That doesn't quite happen here.The story centers on seven year old Olive (played wonderfully by Abigail Breslin). A cute kid who aspires to compete (and win) the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. A chubby, optimistic kid (a real kid, if you will), she doesn't seem like pageant material (and some of the pageant competitors are freakish rather than beautiful and hardly look suitable for seven and eight years old). But, her opportunity to compete seems to come at an inconvenient moment. Her uncle Frank (Steve Carrel) recently attempted suicide and is now living with his sister (Toni Collett) who is on the brink of divorce from her motivational speaker husband (Greg Kinnear) who is riding everything on a business deal to promote his 9-step program. Their teenage son (Paul Dano) has taken a vow of silence as an homage to Nitchze. And their grandfather (played well by Alan Arkin) is a heroin addict. It seems that for everyone, all that they aspire will eventually come crashing down around them, but in a strange (or really, outrageous) way, it is this goal of struggling to get to this Little Miss Sunshine competition that will force them to reevaluate things.A wonderful film and probably the best I've seen all year. Perhaps its success will inspire some filmmakers to become more daring and creative (or at least, where they already are, for others to invest in that innovative style and substance).",10,2,6,14 August 2006
Flashdance," When you're in the mood for a love story... (minor spoilers)
","I guess my review is aimed for female audiences. Sometimes, you just feel like watching a love story, production values be damned.Alex Owens (Jennifer Beals) is Pennsylvania steel mill worker by day; exotic dancer by night. This is all meant to delude her, and pass time, until she finally gains the courage to follow her dream of going to dance school at some posh ballet academy. We see that she has the talent, but she doesn't have the courage to follow through. It seems her friends share the same experiences--figuring out how to make their mark. Cue Nick Hurley, Alex's boss and soon-to-be love interest, who is her last bit of hard encouragement to finally audition for the ballet school. Of course, you can probably guess how it ends. The story is quite cliched.Flashdance is probably best remembered for the dance numbers, particularly the finale, though the ones performed in the club--which have an air of music video style--are quite cool to see. And yes, as another viewer mentioned, many are probably familiar with a few hit numbers on the soundtrack ('maniac' and 'what a feeling'). But shucks, if you're just a sucker for romantic movies (particularly those of the 80s), then you'll likely enjoy this one. It doesn't take anything too seriously, but at least the characters aren't so annoying and obnoxious. It is just a simple, pleasant story about a girl who falls in love, and is encouraged to work hard for something she wants and that, if she constantly doubts her abilities, then nothing will become of it and that ain't too cool.",Null,8,16,5 July 2004
The Butterfly Effect," It should've been called-how to be excruciatingly stereotypical.
","I was rather surprised with this movie, not expecting much from something with Ashton Kutcher in the lead. I just can't seem to him picture with him any kind of real acting ability. I just always see a Michael Kelso. But, Butterfly Effect changed my opinion a little.The Butterfly Effect is another one of those science fiction stories in which characters, distraught with their present reality, can change that reality by revising their past decisions, even slightly.Evan (Kutcher), as a young boy, endured a few childhood trauma along with his three childhood friends, Kallie, Tommy, and Lenny, such as his friend's pedophile father (Stolz). Evan has some kind of problem, however, that causes him to blackout during these traumatic, life changing events. These past events obviously effect the present as they mold the person the four children will become. And it isn't always pretty.As a psychology major, Evan is inspired to study memory patterns, and consequently, discovers his neurological knack for forcing himself to remember things. When he does, he is able to transplant himself back to that time (through the help of his journals that he kept since he was 7) and, still knowing what he knows in the present, is able to alter the past, and also the present. So, his goal is to make all of his friends' and mother's lives at least as perfect as they can be by wiping out as much of the bad stuff as he possibly can. But not everything works well on the first try. In other words, it is an opportunity to be able to 'redo' his past. Evan is able to give everyone a second (and third, and fourth) chance at life. Now granted, the story is a cool idea, but the idea may've been pushed too far. Why are the possibilities for a second chance endless? Why can't there be some point, or at least some possbility of Evan not always being able to go back, or not being able to revise things?The problem with this movie at first glance is that the complexity of the story creates problems with details. For instance, in one of the times that Evan goes back, he is able to make some of the friend's life nearly perfect. Say, Evan is able to start off this perfection by going back to age 7, then we would not expect the bad events that took place at age 11 to involve him, as his line of perfection would've already been set in place. Yet, the journal entries never change. And that's a problem with this movie. Evan's life may change, but his journal entries never seem to, not even after his age of revision.The second problem with this movie is that it is so excruciatingly stereotypical. When Evan improves the present for he and Kallie, she is the sorority girl and he the frat boy. They live in a nice place, he drives a brand new luxury car. When things go well for Tommy, he is a sweater vest wearing campus crusader for Christ type. Evan's roommate, Thumper, is the by-the-book version of 'goth.' There is no character that simply seems to exist as just normal, and not the stereotypical version of perfection or being utterly dismal. In fact, this movie may best be titled, 'Equations for Being So Stereotypically White.' But then again, mainstream pop culture exists on lumping people into one generalized group or another.As a sigh of relief at least, thank goodness this did not turn out to be another piece of obnoxious teen movie garbage.",4,43,76,3 April 2004
No Country for Old Men," 'He'd kill you just for... inconveniencing him. '
","Twenty-three years after their collaborative film debut, Blood Simple, and seven years from the last break of comedy productions with The Man Who Wasn't There, writers/directors Joel and Ethan Coen return to their second comfortable genre--noir--with the unflinching No Country for Old Men. Taken verbatim from Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel, the story unfolds on the parched terrain of isolated, southwestern towns so typical to these stories of greed and consequence; these settings outline the borders of hell where righteous humanity is scarce. 'The Old-Timers never even used to carry guns' begins the nostalgic narration of Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) who, throughout the film, offers the commentary of the uncontrollable taint of Man. This is no longer a country for old men. Lewewlyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is not the typical noir protagonist. Nothing in his character suggests much previous innocence, nor even moral judiciousness towards the choices that set events in motion. While hunting antelopes in the mountains, he stumbles across the failures of a Mexican heroine deal. In something like a circled wagon train. The ground is covered with shells. Bodies lay in pools of blood drawing flies. And the trucks are covered in bullet holes and shattered glass, some of the drivers laying slumped over the wheel. And amidst the carnage, an unclaimed satchel full of money that Moss collects. Moss has such a matter-of-fact approach to his gamble. In modern noir, redemption is not always a guarantee. And, at least here, it is not even an option. Viewers are likely to reason that stealing from a drug dealer, and especially a villain who lays everything to waste without question, is not really a damning fault. Though, it can be a very stupid thing to do. And, in classic noir form, where greed and conscience are often odds, Moss's inclination towards the latter, pose the challenge for his own survival. Moss's crucial worry is not the aging Sheriff Bell (Jones) nor the understanding federal drug agent Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson), but rather his black-hearted personal reaper, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem, closely resembling a young Raul Julia). 'He won't care if you return the money,' Wells explains to Moss when he is recovering in a hospital from the men's first face-to-face encounter. 'He'll kill you just for inconveniencing him.'The story of the greedy man turned drug dealer's prey has been told countless times before and yet, Joel and Ethan Coen have produced a film of such immediate applause (already achieving a top 40 spot in the IMDb top 250 movies list as of this writing). The initial lure is likely the solid starring and supporting cast. The film itself draws on the love affair for retro atmosphere that directors like Quentin Tarrantino have made a trademark, and the only real reference calling audiences back to this century is the comical mention of an ATM machine. But this nostalgia appears to offer a more primitive playing field for the characters. The fancy digital packages that worked for characters in Disturbia, for example, are of no use in this dusty arena. They're not even an option. But perhaps the most effective device in this film are characters cut from a more convincing reality. Lewewlyn Moss is an intelligent man who suspects early on that someone, whether dealer or the law, will come for his claim and he is quite adept in protecting himself. Perhaps his only idealism is that he is convinced he can killed Chigurh. Chigurh, on the other hand, is the unfathomable mold; the man without conscience. And worse, he seems indestructible in ways that suggest nothing will end as we expect, much to the chagrin of audiences expecting easily manageable explanations and showdowns as the final marker in this narrative spectrum. That is not to say that we are left with overwhelming complexities and uncertainties. But, the audience will have to do some of their own work to understand how this tale ends and it almost requires abandonment of typical frames of moral logic.",9,0,6,25 November 2007
Blue Crush," Replicates in visuals and narratives familiar surf films before it.
","this is a movie based on the book, 'surf girls from maui.' i suppose it was a little too 'girlie' for my liking. i mean, sure it was great to actually see girls given the opportunity to show off their surfing skills in a male-dominated sport, but the story just seemed a little too ridiculous to enjoy--that of a girl (bosworth) who's mother left, she cares for her younger, rambunctious sister and they live with their two surfer roommates. the whole focus is about what a talented surfer ann marie (bosworth) is, and she must absolutely win the famous pipeline world classic. but, then comes the love story as ann marie's goal is distracted by a visiting pro football player who treats her with lavish gifts and all that junk.i must say that some of the film was alright...something of an updated surfing film for the new generation of movies. even the photography, wonderfully done in a fast paced, digital version, didn't provide all the 'umpf' that i had hoped to get from the movie. and that is partly because the movie seemed to borrow on a lot of surf movies i'd already seen, including a montage sequence ripped right from the introduction to the endless summer 2 and a bit from my favorite, the north shore.the movie was obviously trying to draw a lot on the females within the sport. i don't think that the film does a very good job of it, nor does it really show you the 'having a good time' aspect of surfing and that whole idea of getting lost in surfing as something that non-surfers wouldn't understand. and i think it was all due to a very stupid love story.doesn't anyone in movies these days fall in love with someone who isn't filthy rich or famous? i think i'll stick with the old soul surfing movies. they were a lot more fun.",5,0,1,9 February 2004
Wimbledon," Romantic comedy clichés ad nausea. (spoilers)
","For the longest time, I was interested in seeing this. But when I finally got around to watching it, I could not have been more bored with what I saw. This was absolutely a by-the-book romantic comedy, and to the point that there is entirely no chemistry and no real substance. It is as though the characters know what should happen each and every point along the way and that, aware the things will end in that she-loves-me, she-loves-me-not, way, react accordingly to their predetermined outcomes. Right down to the very end with children, winning future tennis competitions (twice), and living happily ever after. Can't Hollywood come up with anything creative anymore? This seems to fit the allotted roles of almost any mainstream romantic comedy to be released in the last five years at least. The same thing gets played out again and again and again. Although, here, it could not be done with less soul and charisma.The story is that of Paul Bettany as a mildly ranked tennis player who is competing in Wimbeldon in what he expects to be his last game. He is an aging player and, as said before, not a particularly highly rated one. He doesn't quite have the emotional support, either, I suppose, what with his kooky family (think of his brother as the John Rhys Meyers type of Notting Hill--comedic relief, but a bit less vulgar) and his absentee agent. But, lo! He meets the rather forward American women's champ (Kirsten Dunst) who gets him to loosen up and of course, they fall in love, much to the chagrin of her overbearing typical sports parent (Sam Neil struggling with an American accent) who wants her to avoid distractions in concentration (think John Mahoney in Say Anything, but without such a miserable finale). And yada, yada, yada, you can probably guess from beginning to end how the movie will ensue.I am not so elitist when it comes to romantic comedies, enjoying some of what might be consider the more cheesier ones from time to time. But this movie plays out so entirely by-the-book, that it lacks an flavor that might keep someone entertained.",2,1,4,1 March 2006
Empire Records," Damn the Man, Save the Empire! (spoilers)
","Empire Records is one of the great music-based teen comedies made at the tail end of the grunge years. The characters are fantastic, the story is completely nutty, its got a pretty fantastic soundtrack, and the movie is really a good time all around, destined to bring a smile to your face.Joe Reeves (Anthony LaPaglia) runs a record store, Empire Records. The movie takes place pretty much over the course of one crazy day of adventures and disasters at the store. Adventures and disasters that begin with a night of fowl gambling and the loss of the store profits by the cynical, sarcastic Lucas (Rory Cochrane). That sets things in motion. Joe sees the situation as major trouble (obviously, since he's the manager and responsible for the cash), while the rest of the clerks see it as an opportunity to seize the day! In the course of this day, several things go on behind the scenes of Joe trying to figure out how to get the money back and in the meantime, explain to the owner why there was no deposit made at the bank the day before. As your typical Generation X comedies made in the early and mid 90s goes, you'll have a bunch of different, fairly interconnected situations among a scattered cast of characters and most of these stories are all about who is in love with whom. On this day at Empire Records, retro retard rock singer, Rex Manning, is at the store to autograph CDs for aging fans. Soft-spoken braniac, Cory (Liv Tyler) has made plans to approach Rex and let him know that basically she's grossly obsessed with him. Meanwhile, AJ (Johnny Whitworth), wants to seize the day and boldly profess his love to Cory, if only he can get the confidence to do so. Jane (Debi Mazar), the stereotypical badass of the group complete with shaved head and black attire, avoids explanation of some fresh scars on her wrists. Mark (Ethan Embry) and Eddie (my favorite character, played by James 'Kimo' Wills) are just being themselves, a crazy duo who love to have fun. All this going on while Joe has to try and save Empire Records thanks to Lucas's big mistake.Sad but true, some things get quite corny. Some of the characters are obviously stereotypical and the Hollywood happy ending of such a bizarre day is quite unbelievable. But, basically, it's a movie about music, friendship, and romance played out to a good mid 90s soundtrack the features The Cranberries, The Gin Blossoms, Dire Straits, Edwyn Collins, and tons more. It ain't no cinematic masterpiece, but it is definitely one of the best teen/gen x comedies of its day (sharing the ranks with Freaked and Tank Girl, of course). Damn the Man, Save the Empire!",8,0,0,7 August 2004
Garden State," A movie about a generation that Time Magazine referred to as 'Twixters.' (spoilers)
","Garden State is another low budget, honest movie that knocks the socks off anything mainstream has had to offer in it's tired repertoire in at least the last fifteen years (if not more). Garden State is a sad and brutally honest look at not really apathetic youth, but more like disillusioned youth. You might particularly relate if you grew up in a small town and left after high school and came back to find that too many of the people you once knew never progressed beyond their high school character. That is seriously disheartening, especially if you're that static character. This is the story of Andrew Largeman (Braff), a young man living in L.A. From the beginning, he is embued in this extreme repetitive, ritualistic life that really seems to mean nothing. He is emotionless. He gets a call from his dad to come home because his mother died. And thus, sets off events that force him to rethink things about himself, about his family, and everything else. A much needed wakeup call. Andrew meets Sam (Portman), quite a genuine character as the young woman who's opposite nature of Largeman force him to kind of shake his own emotionless state and confront all those things that he consistently avoids. One of those floating angel type of characters, where they force the protagonist to change because of their differing outlook on things. Kind of like Mark Ruffalo's character's ability to change his sister in the movie 'You Can Count on Me.' Only Sam is quite lively.This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. My only problem with it was the ending at the airport, in which Braff appears to have acquiesed to the Hollywood ending (there's nothing wrong with a happy ending, it was just the sappy way it was done, which kind of deflects from a genuinely honest story and characters up to that point). Braff and Portman give excellent performances and Braff has really proved both directorial and writing capabilities. I look forward to what he has to offer in the future. But enough of that. Get off your kiester and go see the movie already!",9,1,2,5 December 2004
The Big Blue," It's got Jean Reno, what more reason do you need?
","The Big Blue started out to be a fine film. Two childhood friends, Enzo and Jacques, test their strengths against the deep blue sea. Departing ways when they were younger Enzo, the seventeen time world record holder, summons his long lost friend, Jacques, to compete with him in the upcoming championships. Aside from the story of competitive passions and soul searching, you have the love story between Insurance Agent Joanna and Jacques, who she loves, but just can't seem to understand his level of appreciate for deep sea diving. Not only that, Enzo and Jacques are really two different type of divers. Enzo is a flamboyant competitive spirit, while Jacques isn't really doing it to break records or rack up points. He's a natural for diving simply because he finds greater importance in it. And cockiness, as you may know, always leads to some kind of downfall.It started a great film that is, until they paint Jacques to be some sort of dolphin whisperer. No longer does being in the water and competing conjure up memories of the death of his father, but now he finds it to be a way of joining a bunch of dolphins, that which he refers to as his family. Even more frustrating is Jacque's unresponsive relationship to Joanna, which starts out sweet, but eventually becomes a question of, what is Joanna going to do with this guy?The photography is beautiful, and really something to see and something to learn if you don't particularly know much about the 'sport' or how it operates. Plus, the European scenery is gorgeous. But, above anything else, this is a fine display of the great charm that Reno adds to all of his characters. It's a lot of fun to watch. But, be warned, it is also a sad story.",6,14,29,15 March 2004
Big Fish," Journey to the center of your mind.
","Big Fish is a pretty incredible story that, more than anything else, makes me wonder if this is how director Tim Burton viewed the world as a child. Judging by the atmosphere of his other films, I would guess that young Burton had a more wild imagination than most. And, it made for some fine films. The movie starts out with one too many flashbacks in the first few minutes as Will is going to tell you (in too many words) that his father always told him storys, and that these are the stories you will see as he told them to him. But, after those few minutes, things work out smoothly once the audience is able to get one track about what's going on.
Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) as a boy, enjoyed his father's (Albert Finney) remarkable tall tales about himself as a bold, adventurous young man (Ewan McGregor). But, Will, later in life, is tired of hearing the stories repeated at every occassion as his father gladly orates to eager audiences the wild stories. As Will explains, 'The thing about icebergs in that you only see 10% of them. The other 90% are under water.' He thinks that his father's stories only reveal to him, 10 percent of who his father is. And as he is visiting his father who is dying of cancer, Will pleads with him to tell him some facts as he wants to share the legacy of his father with his own child, whom his wife is expecting. But as his father insists, these tall tales are anything but fiction, and are quite revealing of the true Edward Bloom. As the story goes along, the things we think to be fact and fiction are not always so.This is especially a great movie for young kids. The movie is quite cartoonish in appearance, kind of like the live-action cartoonish atmosphere that Blake Edwards was able to achieve in 'The Great Race,' which aids in carrying you away to the reality of Edward Bloom. Edward Bloom (both Finney and McGregor) narrates the various comical situations he encounters in his travels as the 'Big Fish' who outgrows many environments (and thus his reason for always embarking on different, larger adventures). It is like Alice wondering through the looking glass, or Dorothy travelling to see the Wizard, as each of young Edward Bloom's always involve something incredible, and whatever seems least likely, should always be expected. Big Fish is a fantastic rendition of a modern Tall Tales.
I was a little disappointed in that the movie seems to be missing that particularly magic Burton 'umpf' that was always present in his earlier films (pre-Planet of the Apes). Something so rich and so uniquely Burton, I just can't seem to figure out what's missing or why. I think part of it has to do with the intermitten reverting back to reality of old man Edward Bloom (Finney) and his interactions with his family. Perhaps it breaks up the dreamy world of the tall tales of young Edward Bloom. I'm not sure about that yet.But otherwise, it is was a wonderful idea and turned out to be a quite a remarkable undertaking, with Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor, who are really the major stars of the production, giving fine performances.",7,0,0,14 April 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," The Surreal Life. (Spoilers)
","'Eternal Sunshine' is another brain-bending riddle from screenwriter Charlie Kaufman. I didn't like 'Being John Malkovich' or 'Adaptation,' but I thought 'Eternal Sunshine' was really a good movie. Long, but good.This is a movie with an interesting concept: how do people deal with bad situations? Here, a company offers permanent repression of memory.The story focuses on Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet), two people who awkwardly meet and fall in love (I suppose). But, their lack of communication skills prevents any sort of meaningful relationship. Over time, they grow weary of other.This are the most interesting, surrealistic scenes and once that force to you realize that everything you're seeing about Joel was a memory or something erased from his memory (pay close attention when you watch it again to the beginning scenes prior to Joel's going to the clinic).During the latter part of the memory wipe, Joel starts to concentrate on all the good times that he and Clementine had, realizing that he is still in love with her. And the latter part of the memory wipe is Joel trying to manipulate his memories to hide them from the fast sweep of the memory wipe process. Essentially, he tries to manipulate his memories and save Clementine in another part of his brain. It is like Atreyu being chased by the Nothing and salvaging what he can of Fantasia. Joel is salvaging what he can of Clementine and in the end, memory wipe doesn't seem like the best solution afterall (although, Joel probably would've gone for a technique that just wiped out the bad and kept the good). But the interesting part is the finale. Because, these people continue to have their memory wiped again and again (making it one wealthy enterprise, no less). Although, what I don't understand is why would those people keep doing exactly the same thing that led up to meeting that other person (or doing whatever it was the they had erased). Would Joel jump on the train to Montauk (something that seemed out of the ordinary at the time, anyway) every day after he got his memory wiped? So, even as an old man getting his memory erased for the umpteenth time, would he be compelled to go on the train to Montauk and start all over again? It seems pretty stupid.Though this movie is somewhat long, given that you're forced to follow Joel through every single damned memory of Clementine, the repetition is somewhat alleviated by this surrealistic journey until the whole thing becomes so totally bizarre and the situation for Joel so desperate. In the end, the movie suggests that it is more painful to try to ignore everything (and very counterproductive), instead of just trying to face those problems. It seems like Joel and Clementine, two eccentrics, seem really happy together when things are going well. If they just would've honestly confronted their problems, they wouldn't need the memory, and they'd have probably been a couple that was well off for as long as they could be (not to say that happy endings last forever). Kaufman's surrealistic style strikes gold here, as does a pretty fantastic cast. Especially, Jim Carrey proves he doesn't have to overact to do well. Although, I must say Elijah Wood does take yet another weird part as Patrick, the lab assistant, who tries to steal Joel's identity in order to woo Clementine. But, the whole movie is really Carrey and Winslet.",7,1,3,5 July 2004
Saw," The Culture of Morbidity. (spoilers)
","If there is one thing that American filmmakers seem to possess little talent with these days, it's horror films, sometimes trying to replicate the unmatched genius of Japanese cohorts (although in this case, the reverse has happened with one segment of 'The Three Extremes' trying to copy 'Saw'). The result of which is often an abundance of amazingly bad remakes and other failed efforts, plenty of which were produced in the past five years alone.But 'Saw,' although not it's sequel (which refuses to experiment further in novel elements), actually manages to accomplish an effective amount of suspense. It may be the instincts of young Malaysian director, James Wan (who hails from Australia), who may have immersed himself in Asian horror film-making and therefore, fine-tuned his own craft accordingly.True, the story of a rather vigilante dying man who is 'playing god' by personally endowing punishment on those who he believe is worthy of it is nothing new. Several of the psychopath tales, especially of psychopaths with sophisticated torture trials, has been done in the past quite a few number of times.Here, the Jigsaw (aka, the psychopath) has imprisoned two men (among others) and forces upon them an elaborate game whereby one must kill the other by a particular time or risk the death of his family. Despite the extremely grotesque show (made more acute by green tinting and Cary Elwes increasingly pale and almost zombie-like complexion), the undying suspense does not come from cheap scare tactics trying to reinvigorate bored audiences as say, films like The Ring does. Rather, it is all authentic suspense that continues with the never-ending action and uncertainty on-screen. The audio elements provide much of the thrill as well, particularly in the climax of the film where the men's screams are coupled with pounding overdrive chords and other arrangements intended to churn your stomach and get your heart racing just a little more.If you are in the mood for a good, American horror film, but are skeptical based on so many laughable and embarrassing productions to have come out in recent years, I would suggest giving this one a chance.",7,0,2,2 April 2006
Detroit Rock City," The 'Rock N' Roll High School Forever' for the 90s. (spoilers)
","Though done with more of an absurdist comedy touch, this movie is nearly the same thing as the 1978 Ramones vehicle, 'Rock N' Roll High School Forever,' in which the garage punk ethic then (and here, straight glam rock n' roll) symbolized the teenagers true revolutionary spirit against rule-abiding, dogmatic adults. In 'Rock n' Roll High School Forever,' the revolt against 'the system' was mostly characterized by a student-led war against an uptight, out-of-touch school principal. Here, it is basically any adult authority trying to keep a bunch of teen KIZZ fans from getting to a much-desired concert in town.With structural similarities to the 1978 comedy, 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand' (involving Beatles fanatics trying to nail tickets for the 1964 Ed Sullivan Show premiere of the Fab Four), 'Detroit Rock City' is about four high school friends who basically have their own separate adventures and misadventures in the course of one desperate day, attempting to be there to see their favorite band of all time perform, fighting off relentless security guards, paranoid religious followers condemning rock music, gorilla bullies, and more. Put together, it's a great movie that offers a few laughs (especially if you can relate).",7,0,1,26 March 2005
30 Days of Night," Abandon Your Comfort Zone. (spoilers)
","'30 Days of Night' is quite the impressive modern American horror fare, especially when considering that most of that market bulges with bland remakes, sequels and poorly written movies. And while operating on some convention, such as the creepy kid who becomes infected or the excessively gory visual punch (a whole head gradually becomes detached from a body with an ax), '30 Days of 'Night' works well because it loads enough well-timed action, suspense and psychological stir that forces viewers from their comfort zones.Though, this is an easy accomplishment where the story itself dictates extremely limited mobility of its characters--survivors in a rural Alaskan town desperately try to defend themselves a sudden vampire infestation at a time when the sun disappears for thirty days. They are placed in a situation with such dubious odds of survival against very powerful adversaries who may or may not be susceptible to traditionally held rules about killing vampires ('it doesn't mean that what worked against Bella Legosi will work against these guys')--or even how they should be presented (they speak in their own language). Once bitten, the transition to life as a bloodsucker isn't as swift, but once it occurs, the ruthless vampires are incredibly fast moving and their senses extremely deft compared to townspeople armed with regular artillery and weaknesses against the elements. The filmmakers don't need periodic gotcha's and typically written characters like foolish teenagers to get the blood pumping, your eyes glued to the screen and your mind guessing what will happen next. Moreover, this film presents a commendable psychological angle, in which morality is questioned among the survivors in ways reminiscent to John Carpenter's 'The Thing' and, in challenging the viewer's own expectations about how tales such as these should end, it is as similarly short on happy endings. '30 Days of Night' is definitely worth seeing.",9,3,6,8 November 2007
Man on Fire," Remake of an Italian 80s drama. (SPOILERS)
","The style of 'Man on Fire' is at times annoying. With consistent zooming, scanning, and bleaching, it is more like watching a music video and at times, like a series of movie previews. For a story like this, the attempt to be avante garde, seems wasted, and at times detracts from the story itself as you try to slow down your brain to catch up with what is going on. The film-making tries to be too cutting edge while the movie itself, the story and it's characters, are really nothing new, and not accommodating for these techniques. It certainly doesn't do much to help establish mood. And what's worse, though this may be considered 'cutting edge' techniques, it seems to be quite cliché.'Man on Fire' is for me, among the better of recent releases, particularly because it recognizes the importance of relationship to it's characters. I have seen far too many action movies where characters fail to recognize the immediacy and the emergency of the situation, even though their adversaries promise swift death if they choose to interfere. The story goes like this: Former counter-intelligence, Creasy (Denzel Washington) is an alcoholic drifter who is hired as a bodyguard for the daughter (Dakota Fanning who plays 'Pita') of a man (Marc Anthony) who's family fortune is depleting fast. (Unforunately, the opening sequence gives away too much about the impending story, including it's sabateurs).Pita, played naturally by Fanning, gives Creasy a sense of purpose and eases his persistent loneliness, something that once influenced his alcoholism and suicide attempts. He no longer becomes just her bodyguard, but he becomes more like a surrogate father and a best friend. Her parents seem to be out of the picture in her life, or at least not willing to listen to her, most of the time. The movie centers on a kidnapping. Pita informs Creasy earlier that there were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City last week (where the story takes place), 4 kidnappings a day. The swift opening credits of the movie probably place fear (at least in us impressionable American audiences) about traveling or living there if we have young children, as they inform you of the formidable statistics: 70% of those children kidnapped are usually not recovered. Yep, it gives you the air of Santa Carla (you know...'The Lost Boys'). Soon enough, Pita, too is kidnapped. And Creasy, broken over his inability to prevent it--being terribly shot in the process--and over her death, which the kidnappers inform her parents of after the ransom drop goes foul.Like a Samurai avenging the death of his master, Creasy, feeling such remorse for the loss of his best friend, an innocent nine year old girl, vows revenge upon all those involved. I suppose that makes this movie much more violent than a Quentin Tarentino production, considering the creative ways that Creasy kills the minions to get to the top. And he's not dealing with a bunch of amateurs. Those behind the kidnapping are actually a heavily protected gang of corrupt cops who head the department that investigates kidnappings, of all things. With the help of a vigilante reporter (a rare breed of journalists, of course), a high level detective who suspects corruption, and a determined friend (Christopher 'I'm in at least one scene of every movie' Walken), Creasy is going straight to the top to bring them all down.There's a continuous role of religion in this movie, which I find to be quite annoying, but may be appropriate given that it is set in Catholic Mexico City. Creasy asks his friend, Rayburn (Christopher Walken) whether he thinks there is any place for God in the work that they do. Towards the end, while still in the process of revenge, Creasy says something like God can do with them what he wants, but he just delivers them to Him. It wouldn't matter what God thought, because any inclination of that might stop Creasy from proceeding and that to him, may be like giving up on Pita in the end, someone that he was so strongly committed to. One viewer commented how there is not much action going on in this movie, which is pretty much true. After seeing it, I had thought it was a decent 'action' movie (for lack of a better word), but in retrospect, it does seem to be lacking the qualities that would make it much better, let alone just 'pretty good'. That is, Denzel's character, Creasy, seems to just walk along and get his revenge with little or no resistance or pursuit from the kidnappers and their clan--though at the end, he does have to finally do some negotiating (number one rule of action movies: the last boss is always the hardest to defeat). Creasy in a sense, driven by his commitment to Pita, appears invincible. Number two rule of action movies: invincible characters do not make a very interesting story because it lacks all the competition that drives the suspense. And this is a necessary element, considering the entire second half of the movie is dependent upon it (the first half focuses on Creasy's development and his relationship with the young girl).In the end, it seems pretty wasteful considering the potential of your cast--Denzel Washington, Christopher Walken, Dakota Fanning, and hell, even a good-looking Mickey Rourke. Perhaps, more attention should have been given to the story instead of trying to woo audiences with music video production techniques.",6,0,2,11 July 2004
Back to the Future Part II," Great Scott! Even the Doc Doesn't Take His Own Advice! (spoilers)
","It's funny that the plot of 'Back to the Future II' should be based on altering Marty McFly's future. Wasn't Doc the one who was so staunchly opposed to knowing too much about their future, preferring instead to let things take a natural course? 'Destiny!' he called it. But that is exactly what the sequel is all about, Doc's proposal to altar the future. And this leads not only to bad news for Doc Brown and Marty, but for the your Density? I mean, Destiny? (flashback humor).The story focuses on Marty McFly's future. Picking up right where we left off in the first movie, Doc informs Marty that in the year 2015, Marty's son partakes in some unfortunate activities with Griff (Biff's grandson) that lead to his arrest and incarceration. While in the future to fix up that little mishap (again, messing with 'Destiny'), Marty picks up a sports Almanac to take back with him. The Almanac contains all sports scores since something like 1955 (why it is only the size of a magazine, I don't know, considering it covers major college and pro sporting event for a whole lot of years). The Doc, in disgust at Marty's foolish get-rich-quick desires, throws the magazine out (while still in 2015). Unfortunately, Biff, now an old man, gets hold of both the magazine and the Delorian and travels to his young self in 1955. This sets off a change of events in the past so that when Marty and the Doc, now in the future, are ready to go back to 1985, suddenly find themselves in an unfamiliar hell. With Biff changing the past, he also changed the future, creating a desolate, alternate 1985. One where Biff is the richest man in Hill Valley, though still the sleaziest. And where a lot of other things have changed as well. Now, Marty and the Doc have to go back to 1955 and get the magazine from Biff if they expect to restore the future and erase the alternative 1985.This is a great sequel to a great movie. You get the 1989 version of the future (I don't know that 2015 will make the kind of progress we see in the movie with cool flying cars and dehydrating pizzas and hoverboards). This is the special effects and visual beauty of the second, whereas in the first one, it was recreating the past. Marty had to once adapt to 1955, now he has to do the same for 2015, even if only for a moment. But, it also ties in another creative aspect: when Marty and the Doc must return to 1955, they only know the whereabouts of Biff based on where they last saw him in that year--the school dance and all of that which took place in the first movie. Going back to that past means that a Marty 'Calvin Klein' McFly is already there, and the events are taking place again just as we saw them in the first movie. And now, the Marty and the Doc from the future are intermingling once again with their past versions of themselves. So, in essence, the filmmakers had to recreate some of the scenes from the old movie, from different angles, and the actors had to play dual roles (which they do often throughout the trilogy) by being added into those scenes. It was a great special effects/visionary project to undertake, and what makes the series so damned creative and really a fun idea. And here, too, the goal is to avoid running into your past self because, yes, it could altar events once again. I wonder how the future changed since Marty and Doc's intervention in 2015? So, prepare yourself for what may arguably be the best movie out of the trilogy (probably because you get to see the future and past and everything in between; although, I'm still torn between rating the first or the second as my absolute favorite). It is the continuation of a fun first movie, and keeps up the creativity and novelty. I think that was the reason most responsible for its success: the ability to keep offering something new (although some things, are obviously repeated, like the running gag of Marty blacking out and waking up to some version of his mother informing him of what year it is after he tells her what an awful dream he had).So, sit back and let the Delorean be your guide.",9,59,79,23 September 2004
Blow," The consequences of an ambitionless life.
","'Blow' is most nearly like 'Goodfellas.' Based on a true story (like Goodfellas) of George Jung (Depp), one of the most notorious drug dealers of the 70s. Jung narrates his rise and fall as the leader in the narcotics industry, eventually having to forfeit it all for an orange jumpsuit and a lifetime of prison food (similar to Henry Hill in Goodfellas, who traded it all in for term in the witness protection program). But, as glorified as both drug dealers and members of the mafia are today, there is nothing remarkable or even sympathetic about George Jung, though some might say, hell, at least he had all of that money. But so what. His game was dealing drugs, and for that, yes, he is as another viewer commented, nothing more than a sad loser. And the fact that, as a convicted felon, all he wants is to see his grown daughter, it just makes George Jung all the more pathetic that he basically threw away his entire life doing absolutely nothing but selling drugs. Whoopdeedoo.Ted Demme's movie is still a good one though and everyone give excellent performances, especially Johnny Depp as usual. But yes, George Jung is a nothing more than a giant loser in an orange jumpsuit.",5,5,8,4 April 2004
1408," A hodge podge of cheap scare tactics. (spoilers)
","'1408' is the latest hodge podge of cheap scare tactics. The kind that might make date-movie styled horror fans occasionally jump in their seat and scream in your ear, but disappoint audiences searching for a little depth and direction.John Cusak plays a writer who's made a career of writing books describing his experiences of staying in rumored haunted hotels. Despite assurances by patrons and owners that ghosts roam the halls, there is little to make him a real believer in the paranormal. When he learns of the history of Room 1408 at the Overlook Hotel--no wait, I mean, Dolphin Hotel in New York City--he decides it would make the perfect closing chapter to his latest book. But, Samuel L. Jackson, playing the hotel owner, strongly attempts to dissuade his guest with narration of the atrocities that have occurred in theat room since the hotel's opening many years ago. The story is simple and we, as possible skeptics, must sit through Jackson's lengthy foreshadowing ramble. In other words: be afraid! Be very afraid!Of course, it would be easy to convince audiences that they've just paid to see an edge-of-the-seat thriller if it didn't take so long to build up to this point. And also, if what followed was a lot more than cheap 'boos' that become so frequent and arbitrary that eventually, you might soon expect them. The temperature in the room changes automatically. The walls drip with blood. The fearless writer can't open the door, etc. And after nearly an hour and a half of delivering these to audiences promised big thrills, you might sit and hope that at least you can be wowed by the ending. With suspicions of dream sequences and other derivative time-wasters, even that fails to quell our doubts that before the movie is over, we might finally have something to make the movie a little less than completely forgettable.Despite grand performances (as always) by Cusak, who essentially is the entire film, most everyone else of note is wasted (i.e. Samuel L. Jackson) in insignificant minor roles. The true mystery here is how this movie received such a high viewer rating. Ballot-stuffing ghosts?",1,33,57,9 September 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," End it already!
","I'm beginning to agree with the viewers who remarked that this movie is overrated. Overrated, indeed. I have never been a big fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.I admit, the first movie was visually stunning and used some novel techniques for example, to make characters appear much larger than others as actors moved with the cameras to sustain the illusions. It was really something different that came out at the time, especially considering the number of awful movies produced in the mainstream that year, Lord of the Rings really found a good following in a period of utter cinematic slump (at least among the mainstream and partly in the independent features). I think those idiots at the Academy Awards were dumb to pass up recognizing it for one of the top awards that year, probably best director if nothing else. As the first in the series, I think it was given the best treatment as far as writing, visuals, and editing (which would be the bain of the remaining two in the trilogy), and everything else. Again, it was a refreshing change in mainstream films that year, and certainly one well-deserving of the recognition.But the remaining two films, the Two Towers and now, Return of the King, were disappointing for one major reason: there was never enough in the movies (I don't know about the book) to sustain two movies at lengths of three hours or more each (not to mention the additional 'bonus' footage feature on the DVDs). Someone here must've been so proud of their CGI creations and the time and money spent developing the sets that they must've felt like it was just bad manners to leave most of it on the cutting room floor. There is far too much repetition going on in the remaining too movies that could've easily have been made into one three hour film, rather than two.The Two Towers spent an ungodly amount of time with those epic battle scenes between the billions and billions of Uruk soldiers and the few good-willed soldiers lead by Aragon and others. I found myself aching for the movie to be over with, and was sadly disappointed considering my interest in the first one. We are left with a story of fleeting interest: Sam and Frodo on their journey to toss the ring in the fire (though the introduction of Gollum, that ugly little bugger, was quite an interesting part of the story), Aragon and his gang were out to battle the relentless Uruk army, and Merry and Pippin literally got to be tree hugging hobbits. If the filmmakers didn't worry so much about pleasing the audience with epic CGI battle scenes and concentrated on developing each separate story of the various characters in their journies, it probably would've been a much better film. Although, considering that the third movie, 'Return of the King,' contained a nauseating amount of repetition as far as the story, and dragging on time with endless amounts of boring, dreamy dialogue and even more endless battle scenes, I still think it should've been combined into one movie.
Not only endless dialogue of the fortune tellers and soothsayers, but also an ending that never seemed to end. Once again, it was like the filmmakers tried several things and liked every single ending and just stuck every single one in the movie, whether it was relevant or not (such as Sam and his hobbit daughters or the 'Wizard of Oz' ending where Elijah Wood puts on his queerest happy voice as he greets his friends 'round the bedside). The viewer who suggested that they should of ended it after the coronation was right, there was no need to drag on the movie for another half-hour of fade-ins and fade-outs of one happy ending after the next, as they did enough stalling throughout most of the movies, anyways.Return of the King is definitely overrated and was hardly deserving of the 'Best Picture' Oscar, nor for every other Oscar it snagged this year, leaving little to be anticipated during the awards knowing that the Lord of the Rings team would win whatever award was announced. The Academy was stupid for not recognizing it with top awards the first time around, and instead, waited for the third anti-climatic cult fest to finally give Jackson and his crew their dues. There were far better movies nominated for Best Picture and nearly every other award this year (save the special effects nominations).Once again, though, I do think that Peter Jackson and his crew did good with their efforts to recreate Tolkein's stories cinematically. That kind of undertaking for a trilogy filmed simultaneously over 18 months is quite incredible. I just though that, save for the Fellowhip of the Rings, the filmmakers failed to capitalize on the things that would've made the remaining two films in the trilogy something really great, especially if they weren't so bogged down in special effects and cheesy dialogue.",4,16,36,14 May 2004
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," San Dimas High School Football Rules
","'The true key to knowing is knowing that you know nothing,' so sayeth Bill S. Preston, Esquire (quoting Socrates, of course). Bill & Ted are the pinnacle of moronic (but entertaining) underdog comedy heroes, and their Excellent Adventure marks the pinnacle of 80s teen comedies, and in particular, 80s teen science fiction. It one that, like the Goonies, has remained a timeless classic. First of all, you have a story that will probably never be achieved with modern films, at least not in the mainstream. The absolute fun of two rather stupid high school best friends who are able to pull together a most bodacious history project by being able to go back in time through the help of a phone booth. And they're not obnoxious. They're not ultra-rich. They're just happy-go-lucky Bill and Ted and they have a most excellent adventure. Maybe that's because it's like an English Composition theme we'd probably get in real life: how would historical figures behave in modern environment? What a fun idea to make a movie out of. Why can't modern teen genre movies utilize the same fun themes instead of lingering on old film's themes? Although, granted, as is the dilemma of most time-traveling films, there is some narrative confusion (if time kept repeating itself as we see from Bill & Ted running into future and past versions of themselves, then Rufus must be one busy dude and on permanent call to keep the galaxy from destruction).Everyone in it is fantastic from Napolean, the honorary 'Ziggy Piggy,' to Misty, Bill's step-mom and the cause of his 'minor oedipal complex,' to Ox the dumb jock who gives the 'computers are more moderner' speech. Plus, the soundtrack is excellent (particularly the 'In Time' song played when Bill and Ted meet the Three Most Important People on Earth and 'Do You Want To Play' played during the mall scene. You have 80s musicians like Clearance Clemmons, Fee Way Bill, the girl from the Go-Gos, and Stevie Vai (only his hands are visible) showing up. All I can say is....uh....San Dimas High School football rules!",8,1,2,6 March 2004
Sin City," Presumably hyped by avante-garde visuals, not substance. (spoilers)
","I was disappointed upon having seen 'Sin City' the day after it opened in theaters. I am not immediately a fan of films based on comic books or graphic novels, and have not yet seen (or plan to see) any of the recent slew of adaptations. But, this one caught my eye, probably just as it had tempted everyone else because of the director's (and the art director's) tremendous loyalty to the comic feeling (thanks to the film being directed in part by the comic book's creator, Frank Miller, who knew best how he wanted his adaptation displayed). Making some landmark visual innovations that will long outlive the story and probably be copied or spoof more than the aerodynamic slow-motion sequences of the Matrix or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. This is truly the most amazing element of the film, a comic book come alive in nearly every manner from the noir-ish scenery right down to the most minute details of the performers.However, looking beyond the surface, and getting past all of the consistent hype of 'Sin City,' I found myself rather bored with the plot. The story, probably better understood by loyal fans of Frank Miller's 'Sin City' comics, is essentially a series of stories of revenge. In each, the grizzly, misunderstood male hero comes to the aid of the damsel (or often, damsels) in distress, inflicting the most grueling punishment upon those who have wronged their lovers in one way or another. To me, it reminds me of a series of 'Kill Bills,' though sometimes, the villain appeared anti-climatic. If you place 'Kill Bill,' and the simplistic story of revenge in a black and white context, a 1950s noir setting, with monotoned, drawn out dialog, you have 'Sin City.' The various stories become repetitive, the same grizzly character (who often defied the laws of physics as did Mickey Rourke's character, Marv, did numerous times--he is shot, slugged in the face, or run over with a car in nearly every scene) to the rescue of nearly the same woman played out like a broken record.Moreover, the filmmakers appeared to be trying so hard to please, given the thin plot. The cautions of extreme violence were no bologna. Gratuitous violence as it was, the only apparent purpose for it (outside of visual novelty such as white blood that stained up men's suits so bad it looked like bird crap and references to the filmmakers like the removal via firearm of Rourk Jr's ear), was violence for the sake of violence. I have seen my fair share of needlessly violent films and do not complain about the fact that it was violent, but for me, even this element became just as tiresome as the plot because, necessary only to fill the time in the story, which was reduced to a black and white simplicity.I need not suggest that prospective viewers see this movie for the amazing visual innovation it provides, as this was probably responsible for much of the (overrated) hype that surrounds the film (and would this extend beyond the opening weekend?). I would however, caution, that unless you are heavily interested and can tolerate the predictable stories and rather melodramatic dialog, then you would probably fare much better with this movie than I (or any of the other three people I saw the movie with) would. (I would prefer Kill Bill Vol. 2 over this one). But, then again, there's only one way to find out. Right?",6,3,8,3 April 2005
The Island," Like an unofficial remake of Logan's Run. (spoilers)
","This movie was a huge financial undertaking that was really panned by critics and viewers when it was released in 2005. Part of the criticisms, I remember, being about Scarlett Johannsen going Hollywood (and looking so strange here, she so closely resembles Danielle Fischelle or a blonde Yasmine Bleeth), the blatant (and numerous) product placements, and, at least my criticism--making a movie that pieces together, in almost identical visual, thematic, or narrative form, great science fiction films of the past.The Island is a story most fondly reminiscent of the great 1970s science fiction tale, Logan's Run (also on the Hollywood radar for a remake, although this takes care of it). It is the story of a hybrid colony of clones (the setting is more like an upscale gym) who are not aware of their existence. As is the key to most science fiction oddity, they are being bred for a corporate experiment designed to, at least initially, allow wealthy people live much longer. When their health fails in any way, the ailing part can be replaced with, of course, their clone.Like the replicants in Blade Runner (another science fiction great from which the Island is largely derivative of), the clones are unaware of their existence as anything other than normally functioning humans. They have memories of a past prior to life in the colony which they forced onto after the 'contamination' occurred. At first, it sounds like radiation contamination from post-nuclear warfare, but it isn't. Like the false promise of life renewal in Logan's Run, those in the colony participate in a lottery to travel to the 'Island.' One of the clones, unsure about certain conditions of which he is living, begins to investigate things around the colony and soon enough, it takes both he and another clone outside of the colony where he sees a world he had never even known existed. Meanwhile, with the escape the corporation is scrambling to retrieve the clones, hiring of course, the slickest hit-man who's skills may well help keep a lid on all the of laws being broken in the colony.Despite being derivative (especially visually) of so many notable action films like Mad Max 3, Terminator 2, A.I., the Matrix 2, the Fifth Element, Gattaca, and even the Truman Show, this film does offer some interesting elements of its own. Although, the narrative is almost taken for routine, with very little elements changing beyond the films already mentioned. It is nearly as predictable from beginning to end. But, it does offer, at least, a somewhat entertaining almost-two hour glimpse into this sci-fi adventure, doing so with many great action sequences and, thanks to some good writing here and there, a bit of sly humor from time to time (especially from co-star Steve Buscemi). I'm sure the draw of the film, more than anything else, will be the cast, who have gotten dolled up just a little more than usual for the occasion.",5,3,5,31 March 2006
