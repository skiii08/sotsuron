Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Not as good as Volume One, but still enjoyable.
","The main difference between Volume on and Two, is that in the latter, Tarantino ditches the violence in favor of the dialouge. That's not to say there aren't some great action scenes, but it felt a little uneven after all the fighting in Volume One. Like I said, it does have some adrenaline pumping scenes, like the fight between The Bride and Elle, the training scenes with Pae Ming (forgive me if that is not his name, but it's something along those lines), and the chilling burying of The Bride's living body, but it couldn't hold a candle to the adrenaline rush I got from Volume One. I know this movie was supposed to focus more on the plot, and the dialouge in this ones will feel right at home compared to Tarantino's other movies. But I still felt a little cheated, especially the way Bill was killed. I was hoping for a much grander final showdown between him and The Bride.Maybe it was just because I was wowed so much with Volume One, and the way it unfolded, but Volume Two just seemed to fall out a bit to straight forward for a Tarantino movie. Non the less I did enjoy the film in particular the amazing performance of David Carradine, who seems to be the next Travolta that Tarantino pulled out of post fame B-Movie obscurity. I will say right here that Carradine deserve at the least an Oscar nomination for his role. In fact, all of the cast give great performances, and there are no weak links.7/10PS- You don't need to see the first one to go into this, in fact it may make Volume One more enjoyable if you see it after this.",7,0,1,8 July 2004
Batman Begins," Disappointing
","Boy did I have high expectations going into this movie. After making two of my all time favorite films, Insomnia, and Memento, and making a solid debut film in, Following, I thought Christopher Nolan could do no wrong. And while this film isn't exactly wrong, it just isn't better than Tim Burton's Batman. Hell, in my opinion it's a little worse than Batman Forever. What problems do I have with the film? For one thing Christian Bale. I always cringe when I see a graduate of the Keanu Reeves school of acting, and Bales deep monotone whisper did just this. For god sakes show some emotion! Guy Ritchie was able to pull that style of acting off in one of Nolans previous films, Memento, but in this it just doesn't work for Bale.Getting back to Nolan, it's hard to smell his stench in the movie. The beginning of the film is evident with his type of dialouge and dark artsy cinematography, but as the film goes on, you forget it's Nolan's, and it will remind you more of David S. Goyer's (the co-writer) Blade films. The second half of the movie is filled with little dialouge, and because of this the film just drags on to its way too long 2 hour and 20 minute end. And whats with all the one liners? It seems that Nolan and Goyer stuff the film with way too many inappropriate for the time jokes. But my biggest pet peeve with the movie was the score. It wasn't as much that it didn't hold a candle to Danny Elfman's classic Batman score, but more that I could not recall ONE time that it wasn't playing in the background.On the plus side, Katie Holmes does a good job as the love interest, and Michael Caine is great as Alfred. Gary Oldman also gives a fine performance. I could however do without Morgan Freeman's character who is basically to Batman exactly what Q is to James Bond.While the premise of the film about Bruces fear of bats was excellent, the rest of it just doesn't work as well as it worked for Burton (and even Schumaker in 'Returns) if you are more of a Batman fan than a Nolan fan, you'll probably enjoy the film a lot more than I did.6/10",6,3,9,19 June 2005
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Funny, but not as much as Old School
","Anchorman, the comedy about female reporter Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) coming to a San Diego news program, and stealing the main anchor spot from the pompus 5 time local emmy winner anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell),   starts of with plenty of laughs, but towards the end, it gets to a point with the style of comedy is gets redundant, especially Steve Carell's character, who while giving some good laughs, just gets tedious. Will Ferrell does a great job as Ron Burgundy, along with his collleagues, played by (discluding Carell), David Koechner, and Paul Rudd. And cameos by Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, and Vince Vaughn (who actually has a pretty important role) keep the film from getting boring. For what it's worth, I got some good laughs, but I doubt I'll see this movie more than twice. I might have enjoyed this more, if I hadn't rented Old School the night before I saw this. Still, this isn't that bad of a way to spend your money.7/10",7,1,1,11 July 2004
