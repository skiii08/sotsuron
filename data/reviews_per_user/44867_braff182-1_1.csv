Requiem for a Dream," A Must Watch for Anyone Mature to Handle It
","This is one of the most powerful films of all time, and depicts a realistic and graphic portrayal of drug abuse. This film is so powerful it just might make people not even start drugs. Each scene is wonderfully shot and sub par acting is hard to find in this movie. Requiem for a Dream is one of the most under appreciated films of all time but still one of the best and most powerful. Movies like Requiem for a Dream are hard to find, but be warned this movie is not for the faint of heart as it goes deeps in all aspects of drug addiction. I promise you that once you see Requiem for a Dream you will never forget, because from this powerful film, you just don't get entertainment, you get a pivotal lesson about life. So right now you can buy it of the Playstation Store, Xbox Live Marketplace, Itunes, and obviously netflix, this movie is out there, after this film, you will never understand why it hasn't gotten the attention or popularity as other movies.",9,0,1,22 June 2009
