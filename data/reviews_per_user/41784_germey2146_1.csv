The Longest Yard," excellent film, maybe best comedy of the year
","A hilarious display of a modern twist of a classic movie. The movie stands alone from the original due to the time gap and the advancements in filming ability. the movie keeps close to the original plot and story line with add in cameos and enough quirks to make any audience laugh. Adam Sandler shows off his acting ability while still managing to throw in jokes. Burt Renyolds plays a great coach and fits the role of the old football player to a t. Chris Rock is the perfect Caretaker. This movie provides a good laugh for just about anyone who plans on attending, while still managing to entertain any fan of the classic movie. It was definitely worth the cost of the movie and is definitely worth watching more than once.",10,1,6,29 May 2005
