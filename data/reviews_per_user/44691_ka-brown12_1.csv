The Equalizer," Home Alone for adults!
","The equalizer is a very violent film but surprisingly humorous at times for example: when densely asks to see the guy's gun and looks away then just takes it from him. In the warehouse when he sets all the traps, its like home alone and you expect one of the bad guys to get hit in the face with and iron, or a blowtorch but the bad guys didn't fall for that one. You see that the main character can heal himself temporarily but very quickly, and still appears to be helping people at the end of the film, which leaves it widely open for a sequel. I think it's very creative and well produced and look forward for and possible sequel. Good Film!!!!",8,2,5,2 January 2015
