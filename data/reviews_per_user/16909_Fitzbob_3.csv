The Equalizer," Long, Dumb and not so Fun
","In 2003 while Denzel Washington was promoting his dumb but fun thriller Out of Time he gave an interview stating how it was nice to star in a film that didn't require him to do too much. Coming off the back of his 2002 Oscar win for Training Day, Washington didn't exactly sugar coat the idea that Out of Time was a pay check gig pure and simple. Since then Denzel's film choices have seemed littered with these quick cash movies. For every Man on Fire or Inside Man we get a Safe House or last year's forgettable 2 Guns. The Equalizer sees Washington re-team for the first time since 2002 with Training day Director Antoine Fuqua. Audience's hoping to see a return to form from the Training day duo maybe disappointed. The Equalizer feels like another pay check gig, it certainly is dumb it lacks any of the fun of Out of Time...And that movie stared Dean Cain.The Equalizer is a remake in name only of the 80's television series of the same name. The show starred Edward Woodard as a retired government agent turned private detective. He spends each episode helping people similar to the A-team or Highway to Heaven. It was never a show I was practically aware of but it seemed to be stable Television for my parents growing up. The 2014 version sees Washington play Robert McCall, a mysterious quiet man who gets sucked back into his old violent ways while trying to help out a number of people in his life. These people include a young prostitute played by Chloe Grace Moretz. She is under the control of the Russian Mafia who doesn't take to kindly to their business being interrupted. If the plot synopsis sounds familiar it's because it's the basic premise for most Steven Segal movies or any action movie in the 80's. Don't get me wrong The Equalizer is far better than any Half Past Dead or Exit Wounds (maybe not Under Siege) but it is the first sign that this long awaited big screen Equalizer lacks any sort of Originality. Antoine Fuqua with the exception of Training Day has never really dazzled on the big screen. Films like Shooter and Tears of the Sun look the part but never really excite as action films. The Equalizer is no different. Long when it should be tight and loud when it should be quiet. The Equalizer is a bit like a spinning plate. It starts off straight before quickly wobbling then completely crashing to the ground. Fuqua and writer Richard Wenk should take the full brunt of this. The script feels like it should have undergone another re-write, you can feel every minute of the films 131 min running time. In an effort to include elements of the show Denzel finds himself helping multiple characters during the movies 2nd act. Great for them but this puts the main plot on hold killing all momentum. At one stage Washington leaves the film altogether to meet with old work friends (sorely underused Melissa Leo and Bill Pullman) for a scene that does not add to the story in any way. Elements are brought up but never go anywhere. It is eluded that his Character has OCD but this is never established and appears and re-appears at random. All this makes the film disjointed and adds to the already bloated running time.At this point you could forgive all this because it is an action film and you paid to see Denzel kick ass and take names. Unfortunately Fuqua drops the ball in this department also. An initial confrontation with Russian heavies is well shot for maxim tension but quickly unravels once the action starts. The film feels like it's edited in an attempt to cut around some of the violence and this makes the fight scenes seem clunky. It doesn't help that it is so poorly let, a similar compliant that was leveled against Fuqua last film Olympus has fallen.Denzel is always a watchable presence no matter what he is in and here it is no different. Unfortunately the screen play doesn't give him much of a character to work with. The story goes out of its way to keep his character a mystery, we learn next to nothing about him which makes it difficult to root for him. He just comes across as bored or uninterested. He does get some moments to shine and he is a warm presence in the his scenes with Chloe Grace Moretz. Moretz here is excellent in the role bringing a real vulnerability as a young Russian Call girl and the late night conversations they share about books (although very on the nose) are engaging. She brings a real heart to the film which is sadly lost when she is sidelined for the bulk of the running time. Without her Washington's character has no one to bounce off. He just becomes a bore. It would be easy to compare this film to Tony Scott's excellent Man on Fire and the marketing has gone to some length to draw a similarity between the two. Man on fire succeeded because Tony Scott was wise enough to spend an hour of the running time building a relationship between the two leads. Denzel's anger and revenge seems justified. In the Equalizer it feels like Fuqua skips through this stuff to get to the money shots. It's interesting that both films contain a shot of the lead character walking away from an Explosion, In Man on Fire it's a moment which signifies the storm that is to come and the level of violence he is willing to go to. In the Equalizer it's a hollow eye rolling moment thrown in just because it looks cool. It kind of sums up the whole film. (D)",3,102,203,20 September 2014
Sinister," Creepy, Disturbing, Horror done right
","Sinister, Scott Dickerson's horror follow up to the 2005 Exorcism of Emily Rose (turning a blind eye to the ill advised Day the Earth stood still remake) is a rare horror film in modern Hollywood. It manages to be scary. Anchored by a solid turn by Ethan Hawke and an old school approach to scares, Sinister is arguable one of the better horror films of the year if not the last few.Early trailers for Sinister tended to highlight the found footage aspect of the film. It is admiring that the film has a much fresher approach to it. The story instead chooses to focus on the person who finds the footage. Ethan Hawke plays Ellison, a struggling true crime writer working on his latest book. He finds a box of disturbing Super 8 films in the attic of his new home and the movie focuses on the strange goings on surrounding this ''found footage''.Why this film succeeds over other more recent Horror films is in the writing of Hawkes character. Having tasted fame a decade earlier Ellison has struggled to capture the success he once had. Facing financial ruin he moves his family into a new house which was once the scene of a horrific family murder. The idea is to get closer to the victims, write his best book yet, save his family from financial hardship and more importantly get back the fame he so desperately craves. It's the constant threat of financial hardship and Hawke's ego that makes him and his family remaining in the house all the more believable when things start to go bump in the night. Hawke is lucky to be blessed with a character that is a lot deeper than you would get in this type of film. He captures the stress and desperation of his situation perfectly. At times he can come across has arrogant but it's a testament to Hawke's performance that you are always rooting for him.Scott Dickerson and co screen writer C. Robert Cargill has expertly crafted a horror film with very old school sensibilities. The action is set predominantly in the confines of the house and the photography coupled with an unnerving score provides a constant level of threat throughout. There are no quick edits to get scares, no flashy photography. The whole thing has a very 70's style feel to it. The film is grim and tense without ever reeling on gore or violence. The scares when they do come are well crafted. With the exception of one unnecessary jump scare near the beginning the film never seems to relay on cheap tricks in order to get goose bumps. The terror seems to be at a high level from the get go providing tension in scenes that might not be seeking it. In one particular scene, a heated exchange between Ellison and his wife. I found myself focusing on the background, constantly waiting for a figure to appear in the doorway, or from something strike. The use of the old super 8 footage is creepy in itself and I would suggest if you haven't seen the trailer to avoid has the less you see of them the better. Finally the villain of the piece is unnerving, well designed and used just sparingly enough that it is certain to leave an impression. Sinister isn't flawless. Performances outside of Hawke's are more hit and miss. Juliet Rylance has Ellison's wife is given one or two scenes to shine but disappears for large chunks of the screen time. The same faith befalls his children in particular his son who only seems to appear in the house when something strange has to occur. After awhile he disappears altogether and there is never a sense that all these characters exist under the same roof. Some much need comedy moments arrive in the form of Deputy so and so who is used sparingly enough. Vincent Di Onofrio literally web cams it in a small role has an occult college professor. Overall Sinister works, Sure, his family seem to be heavily sedated come night has they never seem to wake to any of the strange goings on. Sure Ellison seems to be very environmentally conscious has he insists on investing the strange goings on in his house without ever turning a light on. These are minor issues in a film that works so well. Sinister is creepy and disturbing and will stay with you long after the house lights come on. If you are looking for some genuine scares, you couldn't get any better than this.",Null,0,0,10 October 2012
Dark Shadows," Confused Mess
","It wouldn't be hard to argue that Tim Burton has lost some of his magic in the last few years. Granted his bank account has grown considerable in this period especially since Alice in Wonderland. It seemed that financial wealth had paved the way to creative bankruptcy. Films like Charlie and the Chocolate factory and Planet of the Apes had shown that the Director was less willing to take a chance instead trying to adapt his 'quirkiness'' to already established properties. Trailers for Dark Shadows provided hope of the director's return to form showing hints of both Beatle juice and Edward scissor hands. Sadly after watching the finished project Tim Burton fans may have to wait a bit longer for this return to form.Opening in 1760, Johnny Depp plays Barnabas, a well to playboy and local man about town. When he breaks the heart of the beautiful Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green) little does he realize that she is a witch and that his decision will cost the life of his true love Josette(Bella Heathcote) as well has cursing him to spend all eternity has a vampire. When the townspeople get wind of this curse they quickly bury him alive. Barnabas remains buried for two hundred years only to be resurrected in the year 1972. He decides to return to his beloved Collinwood Manor where he is taken in by the remaining members of his family. Little does he realize that Angelique is also immortal and she is none too pleased when she discovers her old 'flame' is back on the scene.From the above synopsis you can probably guess that Dark Shadows is a strange little picture. Tim Burton must be commended in a way for being able to use his clout to bring a picture like this to screen. Based on a short running soap from the late 60's Dark Shadows is a mix of comedy, horror, drama and satire. Where the film falls down is in its attempt to juggle all of these different tones together. First time writer Seth Grahame-Smith screenplay seems unable to sit down and decide what kind of film it wants to be. It seems to stumble from scene to scene shifting from violence to comedy. Upon awaking after 200 years Barnabas violently kills five people only to quickly follow it with a joke about the Mac Donald's. It's all a bit surreal and has the film continues you try to figure out who this film could possibly have been made for. It's too violent for children but to childish for adults. Dialogue scenes have the feel of a soap or melodrama but all this does is add a jarring sense to what is unfolding on screen. It is hard to believe that there is only two credited screen writers has it feels like the work of several different people.The members of the Collins family themselves are each poorly crafted. Each character is introduced only to be dropped shortly after. Johnny lee Miller and Chloe Moretz are reduced to walk on parts for most of the running time. Michelle Pfeiffer fares a little better but isn't given much to do for all the screen time she gets. The less side about Bella Heathcote the better. Her performance is fine but after she is introduced you get the feeling that most of her performance ended up on the cutting room floor. She is supposedly the love of Barnabas's life but she spends very little screen time with him. This only takes away any emotion from the climax because despite what is said throughout these two characters feel like complete strangers. All that leaves is the two stars of the show, Johnny Depp is his usual watchable self and he does well to keep his character likable given all the unlikable things he is asked to do. Eva Green is over the top and incredible psychotic has the lethal witch who refuses to accept the Barnabus will ever love her.The film is not without its positives. The look is fantastic and the attention to detail for the 70's setting is inspired. The texture of the decade is captured perfectly and it acts as a perfect counterpoint to Barnabus 18th century lifestyle. The soundtrack is outstanding with songs from T-Rex, the Moody Blues, Elton John and Alice Copper who makes a brief cameo in the picture. There is some humor to be had thought out and it's nice that the fish out of water scenario isn't used solely has a punch line unlike another big summer release Men in Black 3.Technically the film is top notch, it looks great it sounds great but most viewers won't feel too great after watching it. A botched and strange misfire from Tim Burton that is almost fascinating in how much of a mess it is. It is guaranteed to be unlike any other big summer release you have seen in a long time, it's just a shame that the end product never quite becomes what it could have been. By the time the 3rd act showdown kicks into gear viewers will be left cold by what's unfolding in front of them. What you a left with is a handsome looking imaginative misfire that will quickly be forgotten by all but the hard core Burton fans.",4,2,4,12 October 2012
