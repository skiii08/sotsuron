Requiem for a Dream," Maybe I missed something, but I just was not impressed.
","Well, if the purpose of the movie was to make me feel absolutely awful and grossed out, the movie was a ten.  However, I was looking for a little more about why the characters were doing what they were doing.  What drives people to start down a path and never turn off it no matter how bad it gets? I would prefer to see that explored instead of this ode to 'oh pitiful me in a my world of despair that I just can not get out of'.",4,12,25,30 September 2001
