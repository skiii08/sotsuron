Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," If you don't like it the first time, see it again.
","I have seen TPM twice now. I plan to see it a 3rd time as soon as I find the time. The first time I saw it I was extremely disappointed, I thought the story was shallow and the comic relief idiotic. I had already purchased a ticket for the second night and I was really not looking for it at all. But after I left the movie the 2nd night I was totally pumped. I loved it just the way I thought I would. I finally figured out the story line and the over-all plot of the movie. If you have only seen the movie once, and you think you hated it, go and see it again.",10,0,0,7 June 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great Star Wars Movie!!
","I have seen this film twice now. The first time I saw this movie I was a little disappointed. I thought it lacked the spirit of what is Star Wars. I was not even excited about seeing it again, but I had already purchased the ticket for the next night so I went, man I was glad I went. I loved the movie the second time around. I knew what to look for in the movie, and the over-all plot of the movie came screaming out at me. I must have missed it the first time around. I know a lot of people do not like some of the characters of the movie (ie. Jar Jar Binks) but he really didn't bother me that bad. Not even the first time I saw it. There are a lot of childish overtones to the movie, but the over-all plot of the movie is complex and really ties in the Star Wars element. I hate giving away spoiler, so I won't. Go see this movie, You won't be disappointed.",10,0,1,25 May 1999
