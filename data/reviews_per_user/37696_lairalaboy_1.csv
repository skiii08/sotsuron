Walk the Line," I love this movie!!
","I was never a big fan of Johnny Cash,,because I am a little young for that and always thought of him as country. I was so surprised by this movie. I enjoyed it so much. I have gone weeks at a time where I watch it everyday. I have even memorized it word for word. I think it shows a totally different side of Reese Witherspoon and is a wonderful side at that. For Joaquin Phoenix it was also a wonderful job. I thought the actor used for Jerry Lee Lewis was fantastic and wish i could have seen a little more of him. This movie left me wanting to know more about the whole era. This movie has made me a new Johnny Cash fan. Great movie,,great music.",9,1,2,13 August 2006
