The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," Superb! Existential feast of ideas from the Master!
","Kieslowski drives me to hyperbole, but I am not exaggerating when I say that this film is truly one of the best films ever made. It's an exploration of identity, presentiments, relationships (with the 'self' and others) and the soul. Such themes could be messed around,  but in the hands of such talented people, these so-called 'irrationalities' are brought to life with beauty, subtlety and intelligence.The music is amazing, the cinematography is stunning and Irene Jacob is wonderful. This is one of greatest films to explore the idea of the soul - and one of the best films, in general. If you haven't seen it, prepare to be moved by the metaphysical, the mysterious, and the humanity of the piece. If you like the Trois Couleurs trilogy, you'll surely love this too and maybe even feel like you've returned home, to the tree, to life, to the beginning - Kieslowski had the ability to move us all in such ways. Enjoy his beautiful film!",10,32,47,11 November 2003
