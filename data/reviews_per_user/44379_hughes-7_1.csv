Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A 2 hour toy commercial.
","I couldn't believe this film was supposed to be related to the 3 other Star Wars movies. It nauseated me. It made me want to weep at the sheer horror of what they had done to a once-great story. The plot was frighteningly weak, the characters utterly shallow, and the much vaunted special effects were jarring and out of place. In all, I found this movie to be the ultimate triumph of style over substance; a lot of pretty lights and catchy people, with nothing to back it up.",2,0,1,23 December 2000
