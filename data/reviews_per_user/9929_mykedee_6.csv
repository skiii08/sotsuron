The Avengers," Decent film, not as good as the 8+ ratings suggests
","Better than other Marvel movies with the possible exception of Capt America. It has the look down! Heroes we grew up with are on screen together. It gets you stoked! But the action felt rushed and the story is suspect. However what is hard to figure out, is how Mr. Whedon could have made the film any better. I think 'Good' is probably the best you can achieve when making such a film as the Avengers. Too many heroes, not enough time to create a cohesive story, and not enough time to care about what's going on. So basically, surrender and enjoy a good summer film.It would have been nice if it was 3 hours long. Then we could have enjoyed more story and possibly connected better with the characters, as well as had better, more complete action. There is another huge issue I had with the film. Basically its an action flick. So the action has to be tip top! But I think the action could have been much better. Thor v Iron Man, definitely should have been longer. Thor v Hulk should have been more of an isolated knock down drag out fight. The Heroes should have displayed their might more. Instead we got good looking scuffles that kinda felt out of place and cut short in most cases. The ending sums up how the action fell just a bit short. Hulk taking out Loki?! In the comics that would not have been easy. Loki is a magical demigod. No way could Loki have been easily approached and whipped like that. But it felt like Whedon needed to get the movie over with quickly. And at the time, I was ready for it to end.Character development fell short in a couple of cases. When Hawkeye was compromised, it was like so what? The aliens Loki used were an unexplained bunch. The Chitaru felt like Darth Vadar's pawns from Star Wars. There was no way you felt like the Chitaru were a threat at all! The Chitaru were there to be killed until the heroes were able to take Loki down. I mean if I were a demigod, would I show up with the Chitaru? I think not!The best thing about the movie, is the fact the movie finally made it to the big screen. I have waited 35+ years for this. I was an avid comic book collector as a kid, and the Avengers was always the comic book my friends and I wanted to see come true. So I truly enjoyed the visuals. So here it is, finally on the big screen. Enjoy it!! But don't expect depth and emotional connection to the characters, like the Dark Knight franchise. Which, by the way, is a much better franchise. 7/10",8,5,14,4 May 2012
Concussion," Not an engaging concept nor performance
","Not a fan of the Will Smith school of acting. Very surprised he has made it this far with his acting chops. It's incredible that they would hire Will to play this role, when there are far better actors trained in the art. Chiwetel Ejiofor or Idris Elba, for example, I think, could pull off the accent and performance much better. Story aside, come on, we all know the story and the ending. It's not a very interesting topic (only 31M so far), but of course since I chose the movie last weekend, I was subject to my GFs choice this weekend. Her choice, strictly because of the Oscar controversy I should say! A very flat line story, with a star, when put in roles which are character studies and ones which he has to change his voice or appearance drastically (Ali, this role) he continuously acts as if he is impersonating the character. I would say the good ones impersonate without you noticing. I sat there looking at Will Smith impersonate a Nigerian not actually act like a Nigerian. I can't recommend.",4,7,12,21 January 2016
Crash," Vingettes weaved together with a common thread of racism and bigotry, but BAD CASTING!!!!!!!
","Nowhere near a best picture in my eyes. The casting is very questionable here. Terrence Howard as a director, hmmm; Cheadle as a love interest of a tall cute Latina detective, hmmmm; Brandon Fraser as a DA, kinda young looking, LOL that was hilarious. Phillippe as a Cop even funnier ---Come on! Even Dillon, who was good, didn't have that look of a tired 17yr veteran of the force. Finally, the annoying Ludicrous (JAR JAR BINKS comes to mind) talking and talking, rattling off phrases and sentences as if he was recalling his lines each and every scene.Some funny moments of reality. A few real moments when Sandra Bullock and Fraser are changing their locks at home and begin to argue about more racial stereotyping. But for the most part unbelievable story, and bad casting. Who was good? Dillon was decent. Bulluck was very good at playing a bigot with a mouth on her, but not a stretch. Cheadle is always good, but even here I think he played the part short and a bit too safe. He seemed unsure of where it was going, but that was probably because he needed to because of the ending. He is also way to nice of an actor to be bogged down by Esposito, scene after scene.The dialogue is very questionable with the black youths. I am black, never hopped a ride, not a criminal, but have been around that crowd. Umm, LOL, Luddy and Tate were rated G, as in Goofy compared to real Jackers. Even with a bit of education, a person who is ready to jack a ride, do they speak the words Ludicrous rants off? I will say no way! Real Jackers are hyped and focused on the crime not the racial stereotypes of society. These two guys were a bit too casual to jack cars. Also, black youths in general don't talk the way they were talking when together, and there are no whites around. Even educated young black men don't speak that way when there are only black people around, for the most part. Tate and Luddy were speaking as if white people were listening. And none were. Also, Howard when he gets jacked and hides the carjacker from the cops, so he can teach him a lesson, as well as show some black pride; that scene was totally not believable. And then Phillippe's reaction with the police was not believable.So after a while when you are watching scene after scene of unreal dialogue, the movie basically becomes unaccessible and not believable. By the time the little girl was shot, I was already convinced the movie was trying to be too stylish with very little substance-- other than the prevailing message being forced upon us, I could not relate to the Hispanic mans pain and anguish. So it was mildly entertaining and there are some moments of reality.The best thing about CRASH is the movies final song at the end credits. Much better song than 'Its Hard Out Here for A Pimp.'",5,6,12,15 March 2006
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Been there done that!
","After the entire list of user reviews, all has been said. What more can be added to the many reviews? Not much. So basically the movie is enjoyable. There is no character development, not much of a story and there are many non-threatening robot type figures to smash and kill again. They have added romance, without it being romantic, and they have added more product placement and vague hints of potential story lines for upcoming Thor and Captain America movies. The Avengers is becoming a social gathering of heroes in between their own profitable movies. I very much enjoyed reading the Avengers comics books; much more than seeing the Avengers movies. This is disappointing considering I was looking forward to the movies after reading and collecting the Marvel Universe in the 70s and 80s. What's next? If they can develop characters, cut down on the many Avengers they have on screen and develop more inter-team battling (much like in the comics), create better villains, then, we may have something here. In the comics, many times, there were some Avengers away on assignment; therefore it made for better reading and story development. Try it next time guys! 6 of 10.",6,9,19,18 May 2015
The Dark Knight," Great if you don't mind messages, Hype=10, Movie=7.5-8
","Yes, it is everything everyone is saying about the movie almost. . . Great directions first off. Great acting secondly, especially Ledger, and lastly a great score. With Nolan and this cast these things were expected. So here are the the drawbacks. Too long. Why not end with the birth of Two-face and let that carry over to a possible sequel? That would have saved us at least 30 minutes. All the messages in the movie!!!!!! This is the biggest flaw. I come for enjoyment, not to be taught a lesson. So it was good, but after all the lessons and the length I had to give it an 8 (really a 7.5). But let me go back to the direction, the biggest talent here is Nolan (and the cinematographer). The pace of the action, and the dialogue is masterful. The art direction is masterful. And that bike! That was too cool. If you were half asleep before the emergence of the bike, you were wide awake from that point onward. The stunts and the bike alone were enough.",10,2,5,22 July 2008
Thor: The Dark World," What was that?
","Terrible movie. As bad as the first entry and this is hopefully the last. Convoluted, blurred, and without meaning, this was a mess from start to finish. I give it 4 stars for some humor, and the fact that I own several 60's Thor comic books and hope the attention increases the worth of my collection. BAD! I fell asleep early on, went to get popcorn and soda to wake up; after another 30 min found myself dozing again. This is amazing considering it was cold and very loud in the theater. Forgive me, I like story development, and characters to root for, or root against. There is nothing worthy here. This was made because the previous entry made money, so why not chase the cheddar shall we?! Hollywood and their overuse of CGI is increasingly bad and overdone. The characters hop around, as they do in Man of Steel another bad flick. They move really fast and do things we could never imagine characters doing 30 years ago on screen. Well so what?! It looks sooo fake and the result is an unimportant, needless and ridiculously boring movie. AVOID! ps, get a look at the elves as they run in their costumes (big laughs), they actually look like they are in costume! Enough already!",4,40,76,17 November 2013
