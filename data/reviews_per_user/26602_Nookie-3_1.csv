Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Wow
","If you're going to this movie wanting to feel the same way as when you saw Star Wars as a kid 20 years ago then you will be disappointed (after all, how many 50 year olds were relishing the prospect of TPM? - not many), but this film is really good. The alternative reality that Lucas created mixes cultural references from all over the world, and the result is something quite amazing.
One moan though - Ewan turns in an awful performance. Perhaps Lucas would have faired better with a computer generated Ben Kenobi.",8,0,0,25 July 1999
