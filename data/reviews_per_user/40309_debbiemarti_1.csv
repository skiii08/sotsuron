Walk the Line," Oscar Worthy
","What amazing performances! Pheonix and Witherspoon are definitely Oscar worthy for their roles as Cash and Carter. It was a long movie-around 2 1/2 hours but worth every minute. I wish it could have actually been longer. There seems to have been more story to tell. I especially loved the telling of the beginning of Cash's career when he walks into Sun Records for the first time. The determination he had was amazing. The performances were all believable - almost like a time warp - watching the likes of Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, June Carter and J.R. Cash. Thank God Pheonix and Witherspoon did the singing themselves. This made the movie so much better to watch - no lip-syncing!! They were great!! What a beautiful story they were telling. It was a treat watching them. Their on-screen chemistry was beautiful. Quite a bit of unexpected humor, too. What a huge disappointment it would be if they weren't nominated for Oscars...and WON. This movie deserves a best picture nod, too. I am sure the soundtrack will be sought after and Cash's music revived for a whole new generation. What a beautiful love story it was! Johnny Cash was - and still is - a force to be reckoned with.",10,3,6,19 November 2005
