The Avengers," A Flat out Exceptional Movie Event. (Best Villain in Years!)
","I'm happy to report that everything established in previous movies pays dividends in a big way. It's not that anyone needs to see those other Avenger solo films before seeing this gem but it certainly adds depth and texture to this amazing product. Not having to intro big main characters deeply allows the action to flow but also allows for better development. This also allows them to probe deeper into the character's personalities. This heightens the tension, so often missing from comic-book movies, and adds real weight to the story as well as the action sequences which are thrilling and often mesmerizing. The result is a film that's just flat out exceptional.Of course all the phenomenal heroes got to shine and the story accommodated them all perfectly. What I loved is that Marvel did it again with their main villain. Loki was just so wonderful and complex in this amazing movie. Spurned Loki masterfully dances on the fault lines of villainy and redemption. He always keep people guessing and. Again, that's just shear perfection coming from the god of mischief. He has such a mixture of emotional psychological complexity. You have somebody who's capable of thinking and strategizing at the speed of light, but underneath that is a deep well of pain that at any moment threatens to boil over and Tom Hiddleston plays it like the master he has become. This is Oscar worthy villain performance good.The performances in this movie are as good as any I've ever seen in an adventure film. The great actors say that acting akin to playing tennis. The rally that they play with a new partner is completely different from one to the other. Each of these GREAT actors have such specific talents that it's fun to see them play off each other at different times in this movie. I think Whedon realized this as both director and writer and shuffled things around on purpose to play to strengths. It's just another wonderful aspect of this spectacular movie event.",Null,228,420,21 April 2012
Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3 = movie of the year !
","As this century started, who would have thought that a comic book film would be the best movie produced in its first two dozen years or so??? A serious case could be made that Iron Man 3 is one of three or four comic based films that now hold the title of best film of the new millennium. After everyone sees it, those with an open mind will acknowledge that Iron Man 3 can seriously claim a stake to owning that title for now. What has to be the movie of the year, Iron Man 3 will be considered the best of the 'third' films by a large margin. Good luck to other films releasing this summer as they try and match the quality of Iron Man 3, they'll need it.",Null,0,2,17 May 2013
Madagascar," Dull Stuff We've All Seen Too Many Times.
","If there was ever a film that made you nostalgic for old school animated movies, it is Madagascar.It's not only that this computer-generated comedy would have been more visually appealing had it been hand-drawn. Madagascar makes you long for a time when story was more important than cleverness; before having celebrities voicing the characters was a marketing requisite; before you needed to be thoroughly immersed in pop culture to get the gags.Madagascar gets as lost in the jungle as its hapless heroes, none of whom are developed as characters. They're simply the public personalities of Rock (quick-witted); Stiller (whiny) and Schwimmer (fussy) in animal skins. Pickett-Smith, meanwhile, is such an afterthought that she seems to be there only to meet a perceived diversity requirement.This one was a waste of time for ALL ages.",Null,34,63,27 May 2005
Captain America: The First Avenger," Captain America is an absolutely amazing movie
","This is, without a doubt going to be one of my top 10 movies of 2011, quite possibly the number one film. You can rest assured that Captain America is an absolutely amazing movie. I'm so glad Marvel got in to the solo movie making business. Instead of leasing out their characters to other studios, they're making movies themselves and have not missed yet. Cap may very well be their best effort yet! This movie really takes the comic book genre to the highest level. It reinvents epic adventure by 'Marvelizing' characters by making them more believable and more relatable. Spider-Man and the X-Men did this to a degree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material. Anything added or amended was for the benefit of the live action adaptation. Director Sam Raimi pulled this off by talking to the summer crowd, not down to them with the Spider-Man series. Jon Favreau did the same thing here but maybe even better with Iron Man. Now, Joe Johnson continues that tone but adds an old time movie flare which is exactly what the character calls for. He also adds nice bits of humor but not too much. Like the great films of the past, he grounds the action and the concept of a 'super soldier' in firm reality. I've said it before but it's brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and Captain America delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. It's a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun.",Null,2,6,9 November 2011
2012," NOT Entertaining...took the disaster too far
","I seriously worry about the people labeling this thing as 'fun'.Frankly, this disaster movie took the disaster too far. The massive and unsettling deaths are simply too hard to overcome. Nothing about this film felt like entertainment. The CGI is remarkable but it loses all impact because it's so massive and absurd. The first two acts are completely awful in every way. Absurdity mixed with chaos mixed with a sense that you're watching one bizarre cartoon. Cussack and his crew are cartoon indestructible while the rest of the world literally explodes. The third act gives you the flavor of hope that other successful disaster flicks deliver but too little too late for me. Gordon, the hot Russian babe and the viewing audience in general deserved a better fate than this chaotic waste of a CG budget.",Null,3,4,2 December 2009
Avatar," Ridiculous... Plus, A Full Out Slap At America's Military
","Surrogates meets Apocalypto; Ewoks meets the Keebler Elves this is a visually stunning movie that's far more ridiculous than it is interesting. I saw it in 2D and I think the format will have a lot to do with one's enjoyment of the film. The entire first two acts are geared only to show off the visuals. The story itself boarders on the offensive but is poorly written in any case. Plot points involving a stereotypical military as the evil arm of corrupt corporations that want to harm innocents as well as 'great mother' hippie babble surrounding tree energy reduce this film to epically absurd levels. The last film that gave tree energy this much focus was The Happening. Need I say more? It also wouldn't be much of a stretch to call this a 200 million dollar potential Al Qaeda propaganda film. The evil military use terms associated with the current Iraq/Afghan conflicts. Drawing parallels to American military action is a cheap shot by Cameron. Untrue, but his intent is clear even if he thinks it's veiled and clever. Ignorant politics aside, the third act does save this movie. The action as the CG natives take on the oppressive military is outstanding. I still think the CG movements are off in terms of realism but the action was impressive. Overall, I'm sure seeing the first two-thirds of the movie in 3D would've been better but as a film, it was almost painfully bad to sit through the presentation of glowing bugs, scenery and creatures in repetitive 2D.A VERY overrated film.",Null,16,34,18 December 2009
Invictus," Solid Movie but Nothing Extraordinary
","If this film were a woman, they would describe her as sturdy. It's a solid movie but nothing extraordinary. Of course the acting is top level and Clint Eastwood's direction is solid but the story itself is straightforward and often bland. Containing no plot turns or twists and surprisingly very little emotion, it's worthwhile even though it's toothless. It was a good idea to avoid covering the sport of rugby in depth because the goofy nature of the sport is a turn off to most. They focused on the impact of the sport itself and that's what saves this film. Again, it's middle of the road delivering nothing bad but falling way below greatness.",Null,1,2,16 December 2009
The Blind Side," Delivers An Emotional Punch and a Great Message!
","Any movie that starts with the infamous LT destruction of Joe Theisman and ends with actual clips from the NFL draft has a lot going for it. Certainly not a pure football movie, this film delivers an emotional punch and a great message. I've read invalid criticism of this movie that tries to say that the main characters aren't fleshed out enough. I couldn't disagree more. When Sandra Bullock's character says, 'I'm not changing him, he's changing me' you clearly see why. Experiencing life through Oher's eyes is like re-experiencing everything for the first time. You appreciate EVERYTHING and learn that there really are no 'little things' in life. Simple things taken for granted like food and a bed are to be savored and never overlooked. This movie manages to remind us all of that while delivering great entertainment. The performances are outstanding. Sure, it's predictable and there are some clichés ranging from inner city portrayal to a dufus high school football coach but those things are easily forgiven in my book. If you're too jaded to enjoy a film like this then I feel sorry for you.",Null,3,6,1 December 2009
The Hangover Part III," NOT A Comedy At All... And Not Very Good
","This is NOT a comedy in any way shape or form. It takes the characters from the first two films to a dark conclusion but absolutely none of it was fun or funny in any way. It's not just expectations talking because I watched it with lowered expectations. That's not to say it's completely uninteresting because somehow you care what happens to these guys even though the story presented here is very shallow.I honestly didn't laugh even once until after the conclusion. Even then, a few minor chuckles at best (the pants/'pornographie' actions and comment) and the after credits stuff is mildly amusing. This was a very strange way to end a trilogy that started with what I found to be comedy gold.",Null,63,101,23 May 2013
