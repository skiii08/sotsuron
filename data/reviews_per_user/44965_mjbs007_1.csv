Iron Man 3," A thrill ride,with non stop twist and turns what the fans need
","This is a film I've been longing for and it did indeed didn't disappoint. It is a thrill ride, with non stop twists and turns what the fans need. Marvel has once again hit the jackpot with stellar performances from the man himself RDJ and Sir Ben, as well as a rounded story directed superbly by Shane Black. The plot does tend to slip in places but this shouldn't stop the enjoyment of the film, if this is the beginning of Marvels Phase 2 then we are all in for one hell of a ride up to The Avengers 2. My only hope is Mr Downey signs a new deal soon because there is nobody else on the planet who can play Tony Stark, this is the part he was born to play and nobody can do it better.",9,1,6,4 May 2013
