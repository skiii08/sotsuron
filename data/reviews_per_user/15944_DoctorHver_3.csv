10 Cloverfield Lane," Fred Flinstone cannot save this other wise bad movie.
","This film left me with an unsatisfactory viewing. Not because of Fred Flinstone aka John Goodman's performance as Howard which I think is brilliant. Rather an cop-out story telling, major plot problems.First for me Michelle's character does seems to be a marry Sue type of character all to perfect for her own good soon as she starts to take notice of her environment, Marry Sue type of characters are awfully boring watch, unless its filled with romance and/or soft-core. But there is no romance in this film so Mary Sue type of character which Michelle is is not need at all. Second The other guy in the bunker seems to be proper white trash and fool and is unable to make his own judgement, so you will have to wonder who's more foolish Howard or Emmmett who follows him as you watch and he is all so manipulated by Michelle to believe her instead of Howard although there seems to be no evidence why he should switch sides. So you you don't seed any remorse or tears when Howard shoots him and kills him. Third it it seems to be out of the blue as John Goodman's performance gives me similar vibes as he did when he was cast as Fred in that live-action Flinstone movie back in 1994, i.e well meaning but misunderstood character. As its never made clear what actually happened to his daughter or that supposed other girl given the different photos Emmett and Michelle find in one of Howards book.Film is biggest problem was filmed is the ending, because it feels suddenly like you are watching a completely different movie. There is no hint at Aliens through out the film and then out of the blue Aliens appear when she finally escape the bunker, thus the ending is cop out and leaves the viewer with unsatisfactory feeling. This movie is nothing but another bad effort from director J.J. Abrahams whom seems to be master of marry sue characters, films full of plot holes and cop out story telling. As I said in the beginning I think John Goodman brilliant and the only thing worth watching in this other wise bad movie, thus if not for Goodman I pretty sure I would have given this film maybe 2-3 stars of 10 or and 1/2 of 5 stars.",4,5,12,13 April 2016
Citizen Kane," When you lose your Rosebud, your childhood is gone.
","Kane's dying words are so simple and yet so powerful 'Rosebud'.Rosebud's the name of Kane's sled which he lose when he's taken away from his mother. Its the moment when he also lose the innocent of being an child and youthful happens. Those are replaced with the prospect of becoming an adult in an hostile world. That brings noting than just misery and unhappiness. Thus the meaning of Kane's final words's right in front of everyone sight yet nobody see through them. Because they themselves have also gone through similar prospect as Mr. Kane when going form youthful child to an unfulfilled adult. Citizan Kane's far as i'm concerned is just one of very few movies that make me cry every time I watch. Probably because I feel deeply connected with the change of going from child to an adult. Which I find highly depressing. Deepdown I feel like child trying to survive in the hostile world of acting like an adult, just like mr. Kane had to do in the movie.",10,3,4,19 May 2016
"I Love You, Man"," One of the worst movie I have ever seen.
",I don't know were to begin but this has to be one of the worst movie I have ever seen. The plot is much about nothing and its filled with unfunny jokes and toilet humor . These are about 100 min I will never get back. But on the possitive note this is another film Cinema Snob can review if he hasn't allready.,1,0,4,16 March 2018
