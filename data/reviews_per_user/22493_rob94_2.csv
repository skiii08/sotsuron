Requiem for a Dream," outstanding,,,
","there are plenty of films that portray the horrors of drug addiction, however there has been none that have nailed it with quite the same brutality and honesty as the mesmerising Requiem For a Dream.I think that the characters were excellently cast with Jared Leto as the determined Harry Goldfarb as well as Jennifer Connely, but who could forget that fantastic performance by Ellen Burstyn as the lonely widow who's one dream is to fit into her treasured red dress for when she is a contestant on her favourite television show. Towards the end I found Requiem for a Dream very uncomfortable to watch, which is, I'm sure what Darren Aronofsky set out to achieve. Then I found the last scene sinister, powerful and in my opinion absolutely incredible. this is the side of drug culture that we do not see or hear about. Forget Trainspotting, forget Traffic, forget The Panic in Needle Park. If you want to see the reality, if you want to see what drug addiction is doing to our people watch Requiem For a Dream, if you're sure you can stomach it.",9,0,1,5 January 2008
American Beauty," Blooming with roses of power, sadness and beauty.
","OK, I would love to go into great detail of how mesmerising and powerful American beauty is, however there are that many good things I have to say about this film I could not just simply cram them all into some IMDb comment, however I will quickly brainstorm just a few things to why I think this film should be remembered for all time and to why (in my opinion) it is simply one of the most moving, powerful and beautiful films ever made in history. American beauty portrays the hatred, sadness, frustration(sexual and emotional)and the hidden happiness that lurks in the depths of American suburbia. With killer performances off Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening and Wes Bentley this film does not fail to show some of the best acting I've ever seen in a film. Deep, powerful scenes are also a huge advantage of this film for example, Wes Bentley's monologue of how there is so much beauty in the world. The film, especially towards the end, contains a series of unexpected twists that will shock and grip the viewer to the very last emotionally charged scene. American Beauty is a rare treat and must be remembered. Phenomenal.",9,0,1,14 February 2008
