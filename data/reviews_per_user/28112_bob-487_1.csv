Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Excellent 2.3 hours of entertainment
","I had the pleasure of attending The Phantom Menace just yesterday, and to me it was well worth the wait. My children and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I had read most of the comments on this site before I attended, and a lot of comments on your site since, and I am, in some ways offended by a lot of the people who haven't bothered to take the time to THINK before they speak about the movie, or the whole series in general. I saw the original Star Wars in the theatres when it first came out. It was a GREAT movie, and still is, but at its time, also had it's detractors.I think that some of them are probably the same ones (or same types of people) who are it's nay-sayers today. They seem to have forgotten one simple fact - this is a MOVIE. Reading more into it than necessary is simply silly.It's ENTERTAINMENT. Trying to put it down, or tear it apart simply because it didn't meet up to YOUR technical standards, or YOUR idea of what kind of story that George Lucas should tell is childish. Yes it is aimed at children. It is also aimed at the child in all of us who just want to forget about the stresses of everyday life for a couple of hours. The film accomplishes this very well indeed. I feel somewhat sorry for all of you who can't let go and just enjoy the ride. All forms of entertainment require a suspension of disbelief. My kids had a blast. I had a blast. None of the three of us expected 'Ghandi' or 'Schindler's list', just a romping good visual and audio experience with a fairy tale type story thrown in for good measure. EXACTLY, if you recall was the original intention with the first Star Wars as well. I will not give away any of the story. It's just too darn good. I will see it a second time, and I suggest you harsh critics see it again as well, only this time... leave your preconceived notions and your words like 'obiquitous' and 'my discerning eye' at the door. Maybe you'll actually have a good time. If not, maybe you are just too darn smart for the rest of us - the great unwashed - and you should take your little act off to hollywood and make your own version. I rate this move 9 out of 10",10,0,0,24 May 1999
