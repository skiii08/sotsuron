Alien 3," The worst of the four
","Alien and Aliens I loved, but Alien 3, I HATED IT!!!!!!!!!! I don't know why but it's just my least favorite out of all four movies. I just have a problem with the movie because they use f*** over 112 times :( Another problem I have is that I that the movie takes place in 2650 which is a little to far in years.The whole story is just about Ripley crashing on a prison planet in 2650 and a Facehugger, or two of them were aboard Ripley's ship and one had gotten on her, the other on a, DOG! Yes the alien in this movie is the Dog Alien who just gave me a lot of stress during the movie. After a series of fake looking gunfire, Ripley kills the Dog Alien, the thing that seemed interesting to me is that guy from Alien vs. Predator; that guy who was sick and was killed eventually. Ripley kills herself because she knows there is an alien inside her, an Alien Queen. So Ripley dies, BAD WAY TO END THE SAGA WITH A MOVIE SO BAD! But wait we still have one last hope, Alien Resurrection.",4,0,3,18 December 2010
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Don't expect THAT much
","I know that most persons in the universe hate Episode I, but why? I was only a 2-year old in 1999, so I couldn't see it in theaters, however, I did see it in VHS in 2001, about the same time the DVD version was released. I didn't really think that much of it at the time, mostly because I was just a little kid and was just like 'Eh, its a Star Wars movie, It'll be good'.It wasn't until 2010 that I heard how bad Episode I is, so I decided to watch it, didn't really seem that different, I pretty much heard about the bad stuff in it from Confusedmathhew on you-tube.At first I gave Episode I a 7 out of 10, because I was just a young pre-teen who loved action.It wasn't until I saw it in 3D this February that I lowered my ratings and expectations for it. It was mostly because of the 3D effect and it got too boring for me, cause let's just face it, it's still the same movie, but I still purely hated Jar Jar Binks right from the start.",5,0,2,28 May 2012
Alien: Resurrection," Better than Alien 3 in all ways
","To view back at the previous films: Alien in my opinion was a mega-hit success and one of the only films I rated 10 out of 10. It's sequel, Aliens was also good, but maybe a little too much action, but the sequel still kicked butt and one of the few films I give 9 out of 10. But then came Alien 3 which in my opinion sucked, it had too many F-bombs and the Dog Alien was just a load of stress, Alien 3 was one of a number of films I gave 4 out of 10.But now here is the fourth film known as Alien Resurrection.This film was the runner-up to Aliens because I actually thought it was good. The film takes place in 2850 (200 years after Alien 3)but does not really seem like it actually.The story is about Ripley resurrecting from the dead after 200 years had passed after many failed tries. And 14 aliens come along and bring back the classic spirit of the saga. It also seems that Ripley was carrying and Alien Queen inside her and made the 14 Facehuggers.One of the strangest parts of this movie is the Alien Newborn, who the queen gave birth too but was killed by her own child. the newborn apparently has a crush on Ripley which I thought was kinda strange.But still, there was plans for an Alien 5 which is now never going to be made. Alien Ressurrection was still a good enough of a close to the saga.",6,4,7,18 December 2010
Alien," The best way to start the Alien saga
","If you try to see how Sci-fi and a Horror movie would look like if they were mixed together, you would get Alien, everything about this movie kicks butt with no way to explain it whatsoever. This movie also shows that it takes place in 2037, the world probably just changed a little bit though.So the movie starts out with a space-mining crew waking up from years of rest, their ages have stayed the same. The crew find an unknown planet; they go there in hopes of finding iron ore. One of the men finds a room filled with mysterious eggs, he looks into one and suddenly a creature called a Facehugger clamps onto him. The crew studies the guy and cut one of the Facehugger's legs as it's acid blood drips down the decks. Later the Facehugger is off of the guy's face.Later, the guy goes in pain as an Alien Chestburster comes out of him and runs to the lower levels of the ship. Later when a guy finds the member Ripley's cat, the fully-grown alien comes up behind him and strikes him with it's inner-jaw. Ripley and the crew decide to hunt the alien down and kill it. The alien eventually kills the other crew members leaving only Ripley left.Ripley, thinking that the alien is still on the self-destructing ship, get's into a smaller ship and flies into space as the main ship explodes in the distance. Ripley prepares for another long sleep period until she finds out that the alien is on the ship.Ripley acts fast as she puts a astronaut suit on so the alien does not get D.N.A in her. She blows the alien out into space and burns it with the thrusters. Ripley then prepares for another years of sleep.",7,1,3,18 December 2010
Predator," Probably one of the best films of 1987
","My dad and I both love this movie because for probably all the action and suspense or something.This movie is for sure on my top 10 favorite movies.The film takes place inn the actual year 1987, not like Alien in the year 2037. A squad of army guys go to a jungle in Central America probably to take out another enemy squad. on the way they come across an alien hunter known as 'Predator' and pretty much most of the squad is killed except or 3 or 2 of them.I give Predator a 8 out of 10 for unknown reasons though.",8,1,2,27 December 2010
Aliens," Aliens is good, Alien is better
","Aliens is the sequel to Alien you can already tell. This movie seems more of a Sci-fi rather that Horror.The movie starts out with a crew finds Ripley's small ship from the first movie as it crash-lands. When Ripley wakes, the crew tells her that it is now 2094 since she was asleep for 57 more years. They also tell Ripley that the aliens from Xennomorph (the mysterious planet) are being colonized and that they will need lots of firepower for all the aliens.Ripley joins the crew which is a military team goes to Xennomorph to hunt the aliens. Ripley will only join them if they are going to kill the aliens and not to make the same mistake in 2037. The team needs to be careful not to let other teammates get Facehuggers connected to them so more aliens would not come.As the team battle their way though the aliens, it's just down to Ripley and a young girl. The two find the Alien Queen who is making for Facehuggers. All hope seems lost until Ripley gets into a exoskeleton suit which is later seen in Avatar.As Ripley says 'Get away from her you b***h!' she battles the Alien Queen as the two escape the alien effected base and sleep for more numbers of years.I give Aliens a 9 out of 10 since this movie is more Sci-Fi that Horror.",8,3,5,18 December 2010
Alien vs. Predator," Alien + Predator = Cool Film
","I know some people say this film is bad... I love it.But I don't think that the title should have the AVP in it. Because it's better just as Alien vs. Predator.The film takes place in October 2004 when something in Antartica effects Wayland (that business in Aliens). They call for Elexa Woods who apparently does not want to work with Wayland.The team goes to Antartica because Charles Wayland told them that there was a Pyramid 10,000 ft below the ice.They also comes across an old village from 1904 with lots of stuff left there.They find the place when a Predator ship detects them and sends down three Pedators to hunt them down.The team discovers that the Predators used the Aliens as sacrifices to battle them.An Alien Queen awakens and breeds loads of Facehuggers to breed some aliens.Alien and Predator eventually meet and battle.At one point there is only one Predator left, he gets a Facehugger on him while marking himself.Elexa and Predator team up to and battle though the Aliens and need to get back to the surface.After fighting the Alien Queen and Predator getting stabbed by the queen.The Elder Predator takes the dead Predator aboard their ship and leave Earth.When all seemed over, until a Predalien bursts out of Predator; time for a sequel.",7,0,1,27 December 2010
