Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Criminally underrated film
","Complex plot, the characters were sublime and full of personality and character, there was loads of backstory and lore added to the SW franchise with this film. Darth Maul looked so cool. The best thing about this film was how the Jedi Order took Anakin away from his sexy Mother, as a black man who adopted a white son, this film truly showed that diversity is a strength when a group of strangers took a boy away from his genetically close Mother for the greater good, the diversity is strong with this one",9,5,8,21 December 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Most diverse Star Wars yet
","It's the most diverse Star Wars movie to date and of course diversity is our strength. I love how Jynn Erso falls in love with a Hispanic man, that'll definitely get her brutal white Imperialist ancestors out of her children. I loved how Jynn's smelly white feet gently pounded on wet soil in this film, I found that very cute. The battle sequences were amazing and the special effects were out of this world. Could've been better if there were some transexual's, homosexuals and pansexual's in it though as a reminder that diversity is a strength. As diversity is a strength there should've been far more animals, mentally disabled people and robots in this film as well.",8,0,2,21 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," This movie's not diverse enough!
","I respect this film for having a black and a East Asian character in it. But I do not respect it for not having a character of each ethnicity in it. Where's the Arabic characters, where's the eskimo characters, where's the native American characters, where's the latina characters?! I'm also very disturbed that film film didn't have equal screen time distribution of both genders and although it had a black character and a East Asian character their screen time wasn't as much as the white characters overall. To of truly been a perfect film this must have had screen time that composed of 10% white person screen time, 10% black person screen time, 10% Latina person screen time, 10% East Asian person screen time, 10% Arab person screen time, 10% Pakistani person screen time, 10% Indian person screen time, 10% person native American screen time, 10% Greenlandic person screen time and 10% mixed race person screen time to truly bring equality to society and showcase that all ethnicities are equal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also this film deeply offended me as I can't do all the magic powers some of the characters can do in the film so that made me squeal like a little girl and gave me sleepless nights for two days after watching this truly disturbing film!",1,13,22,14 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," It's not a sexy, environment friendly original film.
","I loved how stupid Han was to actually believe his Son still cared about him and was actually worth his time to even speak to, it felt like a fitting end to the worst character of all time that took a poop on Anakin's legacy by sexually abusing his daughter.However, this is a poor remake of A New Hope for the most part except Luke is a cheap replacement for Obi-Wan as Luke has no dialogue and only appears for 5 seconds and the other main characters are even more mindless than the OT main characters. It also had featured far too much spaceships in this film to the extent I think it's done some children some damage by encouraging them to wreck the environment by spending as much time in motorised vehicles as possible.",4,6,8,21 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Great film but a bit gay
","Great special effects especially for the day. Plot was somewhat simplistic, but it was action packed and entertaining largely due to it being fast paced and lacking any real dull scenes. However the characters could've been far better, after all the main characters are just an ambitious farm boy, a Princess with a typical Female personality, an animal that doesn't talk and barely does anything and a cocky annoying space cowboy.I'm a huge fan of the Star Wars Prequels and prefer them to the Original trilogy and I was very uncomfortable when Han was hitting on Leia in this film. I felt Han was sexually abusing Leia and I kept crying that Vader would find out and be so sad. Han seemed more masculine and stronger than Anakin, but I hated Han so that made me feel even more hopeless for Leia and Vader's situation with confronting an annoying pervert. Honestly Han was so annoying, gay and strong that I had nightmares of him sexually abusing Anakin after first watching this film. Avoid this film if you're a homophobic and love Anakin so much.",7,0,8,21 December 2019
