Walk the Line," I was surprised
","I was very surprised by the performances especially the vocals from the Reese and Joaquin. Reese really nailed it. Joaquin struggled early on but had it down pat by the end. And overall excellent production especially for a biog. The story line was excellent and brought out Johnny's character quite well. Along with Phoenix's performance, Reese pulled off June Carter so well you knew why Johnny fell in love with her and was willing to change and pull himself up from his addictions. Thanks to the producers, directors and cast that made such an excellent film honoring Johnny and depicting him as the American music icon that he so well deserved to be. Watching this movie touched my soul and helped me to understand better those who sometimes make bad choices without intending to.",10,1,2,24 September 2006
