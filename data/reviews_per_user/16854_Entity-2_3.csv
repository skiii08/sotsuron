Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This film was a joke.
","I was raised on Star Wars.  When I was in the theatre and the screen flashed 'STAR WARS', followed by the familiar music and scrolling text, I felt euphoric.Then the movie itself started.Every complaint about this movie is 100% accurate.  I won't buy 'this has to set the stage', because you can set the stage and still make an enjoyable movie that can stand on its own.  Midi-chlorins ruined the mysticism of the Force.  Too small-scale.  Too convulated.  The way Anakin 'saved the day' was riot-worthy.  Jar Jar was almost literally just thrown in; the main characters just bump into him while walking through a forest!  Then there's the pointless underwater fish sequence...what was that supposed to be?  A serious action scene?  Something humorous?  It was a waste of film.Darth Maul had no point in even being in the movie.  He, like Jar Jar, was thrown in.  I fell in love with the character upon first seeing him in the previews, but I wrongly assumed he would play some kind of ROLE in the story... instead, he shows up, the two Jedis take out their lightsabers and run off to fight him on cue:  'Oh, there's Darth Maul, right on time. Time to go run along and fight him to the death now.  Later, all.'The special effects are all DISPENSABLE.  Lucas DID do a good job of making his effects look real, so real that they fade into the background and you don't even really care one way or another about them.  He didn't break boundaries; films like T2 and Jurassic Park broke the boundaries for this decade.  All TPM did was further them.We were shown a lot in this, and EVERYTHING was a let-down.  I cannot fathom how people, true fans of the trilogy, are liking this film.... just as I cannot fathom how true Star Trek fans liked 'First Contact'.Lucas didn't show us anything we couldn't have imagined ourselves as far as how the first trilogy would have gone.  No plot twists.  No revelations. Everything was not just predictable, but mundane.",Null,0,1,9 July 1999
X-Men," Disappointing.
","I just can't believe how everyone's falling in line for this film.  So disco balls didn't lower out of the ceilings during the fight scenes.  Is that how little you wanted?  Outdo BATMAN & ROBIN and everyone falls in love with you.  Well, what kind of accomplishment is that?All they had to do was stay true to the source material, do some competent casting, and load it down with FX.  But no.  They decide to fail in each one of those categories.SOURCE MATERIAL - Xavier has to introduce Sabertooth to Wolverine.  Enough said.CASTING - Halle Barry as Storm?  She's like a child playing dress-up. Cyclops looks trendy.  Jean is old enough to be everyone's mother.  Magneto looks too old to go to the bathroom himself, let alone threaten the world. And Wolverine?  Contrary to what EVERYONE keeps on SAYING, he is NOT Wolverine.  Not even CLOSE!  Just what are you all on?  Hugh Jackman is taller than Cyclops, and way too skinny.  And Singer decided to trade his log cabin feel for a Harley/trucker feel.FX - Did you see any?  If there's one thing you would've thought you could count on from Hollywood, it's FX, but not here.  Nor is there any good stunt-work, choreography, or anything.  The action SUCKS.  It looks like it was all done by ameteurs.  Where the hell did all of the budget go? Probably into things like Halle Barry and her three lines, or the 3-D morphing map.  Money well spent, all right.Oh, there is so much more to complain about...Magneto doesn't have a costume, because Singer wanted him to be more down-to-earth, so he gives him a LAIR instead.  Oh, but no Dr. Evil is complete without his obligatory invention of doom.  Tell me, why did Magneto need such a plot device as the mutation-triggering machine?  Isn't his magnetism itself the plot device?  Oh, but that's not enough, I guess.  So, instead of just showing Magneto kicking ass, they take the money they could've spent on his electro-magnetic sphere and put it towards lame-ass white radiation.  Other casualties of this stupid plot device include half the running time of the movie, Senator Kelly, and oh yeah - any hint of respectability.The thing that gets to me the most is, I think I hate this movie more because I can picture watching it from a non-fan point of view.  Wolverine has a thing against Cyclops.  Because.  He has an attraction toward Jean. Also, just because.  There is NO flesh given to these relationships, they just pop into existence.Erik Lewald should have made this movie.",Null,0,0,15 July 2000
Blade II," Popcorn entertainment that ENTERTAINS -- what a concept!
","The plot and characters are sketched thinner than bible paper, but I can't take it when people say the film is 'not very smart.'  Excuse me?  This movie mirrors Anime in its lean, evocative approach to storytelling.  It chooses style over substance, but unlike most American film, it doesn't try to:  (a) pretend like it has substance too, or (b) sabotage your imagination from filling in the substance.  The sins of this approach may include effervescence and sodomy, but at least it's a breath of fresh air from the Huxley-esque entertainment Hollywood normally tries to dish us.  Why don't we just down a Soma tablet and be done with it?  Sometimes I think people are honestly so dumb they really believe that last Arnold flick was better than this because it 'tried' to have depth.  Right.  You mean it went through the assembly line.  Blade II came out of its own shop.",Null,0,1,4 September 2002
