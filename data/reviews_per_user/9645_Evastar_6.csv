The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Bill Condon's miracle
","I waited for this film with the biggest anticipation and...at last! The BIG day came. From the first moment of the film everything is perfect. Absolutely perfect. I also loved the three previous films, but this one so different and so awesome and unique in the same time. The wedding scene so moving...The honeymoon...full of deep feelings and heartbeats...The pregnancy..the birth and the final scene...can't really describe with words!!!!!!!! The only negative thing about this movie is a)it leaves you again with much more bigger anticipation for part II -Jeeezzz...another full year!!?!, b)leaves you 'thirsty' for more love scenes (hopefully some extra scenes will be included in the DVD release :-)))) ). Bill Condon..Thank you!!!!!!",10,17,44,17 November 2011
Troy," A really entertaining -AND educating- film!
","I've watched 'Troy' again and again and I never get bored. It excites you from the first moment to the last. I believe that all of the actors were superb in every way and they gave their best shot being the heroes in the movie. As always I hardly understand the critics and their way of thinking and to be honest I don't care what other people think of a movie -critics or not. A movie is art, as is a book or a painting and art is always subjective regarding beauty, quality, entertainment etc. Probably there are some different points of view regarding what Homer has mentioned in his Iliad epic poem and what was actually seen in the movie, but that was the director's point of view and despite all, the key conclusion of the poem remains the same. And as other people mentioned here, I really liked the realism in the movie, without any actual presence of Gods. Achilles was like a semi-god in a very human, realistic way. 'Troy' is another example not to blindly listen to any specific critics of supposedly movie experts (and how can an expert of any kind of art really advise me what I should like and what I shouldn't like?!?), so give it a chance -at least!",9,1,2,4 August 2011
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A long plot-twist in a galaxy far, far away...
","I waited for so long for this movie. I counted years, months, weeks, days and hours to watch it. I anticipated it with excitement and sadness and fear of what would be showed to us as the very end of the Skywalkers and the Star Wars Saga with which I grew up. For the first half of the movie I was so excited Iwanted to scream! Everything was so thrilling and adventurous, full of action with awesome duels and starship fights. Then... THEN... came an endless roller-coaster ride! I was constantly jaw-dropped. Unexpected surprises, sad surprises, subversive developments ....The whole movie was an enormous plot-twist! There were many deja-vu scenes, memories and lines, but not disappointing. They were necessary for a perfect conclusion. I liked this movie, I LOVED this movie, until the point where one of my most beloved characters didn't end up the way I wish. They chose a different path for him, which I might comprehend better in time...I always give 10/10 to all the Star Wars movies, because I'm a helpless fan and love everything StarWars-y with all its perfections and all its flaws. So, yeah, I might wanted a different ending, but I know I will learn to love and accept the way it is. That's it. It's not gonna change. In real life everything works pretty the same!",10,3,14,21 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A masterpiece from a galaxy far far away!
","First, I wonder why all the haters' user reviews are on the top of the others?...Disturbing this is...and unfortunate! :-P ...Probably, they don't have anything else to do, than stay online and spread their unreasonable hate...Ugh...No matter what, the Metacritic is the highest of all Star Wars!! Woohoo!!! Anyways, I found the movie all in all AMAZING beyond any imagination. It surprised me positively from the first moment and I loved the fact that it was a much different Star Wars movie. More modern, more subversive with a wider aspect of all things. A Star Wars movie for the next generations. I myself am a Star Wars fan since I was 12-13 years old and now in my 40s I didn't mind the change. I welcomed it with great applause and interest. I was impressed particularly of the Force capabilities that were shown and weren't mentioned or appeared before in the Star Wars Saga. I understand that some people found that annoying, but I found it somewhat cathartic...Like all this time we were able to experience only a tiny sample of the Force, forcing us to a certain point of view of the Force....But now, yes! That's it! That's how 'maxi big the Force' is!!! Thank you, Rian!! As Qui-Gonn and Yoda once said about the Force, 'life creates it, makes it grow...its energy surrounds us and bind us...' Just because we didn't see so far any other Force capabilities, doesn't mean these are false or crazy. This film showed us something new, something fresh and also something funny -as all the Star Wars movies have a great deal of humorous scenes, this one also had it in a 'healthy' amount -only funnier! Something that comes to mind regarding the negative reactions, are the words of Palpatine to Anakin in Episode III, that we should embrace the whole aspect of the Force, not only the dogmatic, narrow view of one part of it....Well, ok, that sounded a little bit dark-sided, but you got my point hopefully!... We have to keep our minds open and welcome the positive change and continuity of the Star Wars universe.
After I went out of the cinema, I wanted to go home and play with my little star wars figurines...Yes, Rian, goal accomplished!!....And Rylo FTW! :-D",10,5,19,18 January 2018
Beauty and the Beast," Magical in every way
","Beauty and the Beast was my most favorite Disney movie ever and hearing the news that it's going to be with real actors...oh my gosh -I couldn't wait! And the movie met my expectations more than I could ever wished for!! Generally I loved the thing that it was so close adapted to the original...I think that was the purpose: To bring to the next generations as perfect as it was, but with the necessary fresh twist. From the first moment you hear the intro music, you feel the trigger of emotions in your spine....and it gets into you till the very end...Laughing, singing, crying....all the emotions you could feel watching the original, were all coming back, even stronger. Seeing your favorite characters come to life, makes it even more intense. The actors\actresses chosen couldn't be more perfect for their roles! Emma Watson was like she was born to be Belle...and so was Dan Stevens! His voice, his eyes..were a perfect match with the Beast! Josh Gad...?!! Oh my gosh...If there weren't those 26 years between this and the original, I would swear that the made LeFou watching Josh! Sooo identical! Luke Evans? Perfect! And all the rest as well. Plus there were so many extra elements in the movie that filled us some story gaps from the original, like what was like the Prince before the transformation or why did Belle and her father were so different from the rest of the villagers...And of course there are some new songs, which we are going to love equally I believe. Also all the technical stuff in there was so unbelievably amazing!...The castle, the rooms inside, the costumes...everything was made with perfect detail! Many times I got myself distracted from the characters staring the dazzling objects on the background. So, don't even hesitate a little...Watch and enjoy this wonderful movie!",10,2,10,27 March 2017
Fifty Shades of Grey," Not another bad movie I love
","I hesitated watching this film, because -after reading the books- I thought I wasn't in the mood to see some porn-like film...But, luckily it wasn't as...graphical as in the books! As a Twilight fan, I found the books AND the movie some like a parody to Twilight...Dangerous man, innocent girl, forbidden relationship, upper-lip bites like Kristen (?!!?), identical lines like 'I can't stay away from you anymore..-Then don't'!...WTF?! EL James probably thought that she could add to Twilight lots and lots of sex and resell it with another name -and a slightly different plot. And if the books were quite entertaining for a summer afternoon, the movie was at most mediocre...I regret to say that Dakota Johnson was either not for this particular role or she's a non-talented actress...Jamie Dornan was the only good thing about this film I'm afraid. I really liked him in 'Once upon a time'! I hope he'll make better film choices in the future!",6,0,2,2 July 2015
