3:10 to Yuma," Lets ground this thing
","I see all the possative comments for this film, so I was looking forward to it, I hadn't seen the original and although not a western fanatic, if they made three great westerns a year, I would hapily watch them. I will agree with everyone else on the performances, the casting, the storyline but COME ON !!!! that ending !!! what were the writers thinking..now heres the spoiler >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>lets be realistic, you're a hardened career western bad guy you meet an honest working farm guy who stands up to you were most would crumble and respect him for it. However he later is part of the posse charged with taking you to certain death in the law system and has to get you to a town 80 miles away and onto a train to face justice.. your loyal gang pursuit you for two days to rescue you (the gang that you have been with for years) over these two days, this man shows you no more kindness or any intent of befreinding you, but in the climax (now the real big spoiler) you shoot all your rescuers and board the train of your own free will, into a jail carraige because you respect him so much after your gang of rescuers shot him in their attempt.I Don't THINK SO !!!so the who movie was ruined at the end with this absurdity.",3,9,18,11 October 2007
Skyfall," A franchise falling apart
","Main spoilers near bottom look for warning.What have they done to Bond, this was not a film that lives up to the expectations of the Bond franchise. As a film in it's self it was okay, nothing to write home about, in fact had this film not had a character in it called Bond it would have gone straight to video (DVD BLURAY whatever it is nowdays).This film has enough quality actors to deliver. I do however care if I am able to follow the plot, accept that the reasoning and rational is not too contrived to make a storyline. This film falls at both these points. The fact that I can say points about this film is a bit of an irony, in that it is pointless. Rules of Bond are quite simple, he saves the planet from devilish madmen hell bent on world domination, he does not bother with petty shoplifters, car thieves and in the case of this film, some balloon who has a vendetta against M. From the outset it was a sequence of 'bond Style' locations and chases but lacked any sequence, unravelling of story or development of either a 'evil villain' or 'Bond Girl' in fact there was not a bond girl in the film. So it went from car chase to bike chase to train chase to casino to boat to island to London to Scotland so all the ingredients but without a purpose, nothing unravelled. This film made no sense.we were just expected as viewers to trust that bond had some reason to go to the places listed above without any real reason other than they are 'Bond Ingredients'. Hints were dropped here and there that normally would have some depth, instead they were just keywords to associate one scene with another 'Principally the word SKYFALL' which gets a mention by a shrink to bond but then gets brushed under the carpet like its some hidden codeword that cannot be talked about leading us to believe the shrink had some purpose to bring up such a word....nope it was apparently random to the shrink.Please when watching this (as no doubt you will, hell its Bond) just separate the franchise and evaluate the film as if it was a new spy character series like Bourne, and when you do that you see this film has no substance whatsoever. Awful awful awful.Sam Mendes should not be allowed behind a camera again if he can cock up this tried and tested formula. Craig is looking rough, and while still better looking than me, I wouldn't pitch myself as Bond and neither should he.below more direct spoilersIt introduced a new Q character, cashing in on the geek chic by making him an attractive chap, but didn't give him enough substance for him to reoccur in the next film. They take a trip to Scotland for reasons only known to Mendes himself which turns out to be Bonds childhood home called 'skyfall'... hurrah a meaning to the title, not quite on par with goldfinger, man with a golden gun, moonraker etc, Skyfall a derelict old house where Mendes cannot decide if Bond was an orphan or had a father or whether all his possessions upon bonds premature bodyless death were put into storage or sold off. bond goes to Skyfall to have the villain come to him instead of being on the backfoot, however bond goes completely unprepared and has to resort to old shotguns (Bond is never unprepared for anything you idiots..shaken not stirred is his catchphrase mendes !!).gets helped out by an old man that recognises this 44 year old craig who has been looking after the place faithfully for what must be 40 years by my reckoning despite his parents being dead and him being orphaned, he kept the place batman esq ideal for Bonds return, who this gamekeeper will now lay down his life for, even though clearly bond has not been in touch.and does bond succeed in protecting M..no he fails and M dies...BOND SHOULD NOT FAIL !",2,4,10,2 January 2013
Hereditary," A New Classic!
","About time!
its been a long wait for m to find a horror genre film which was worthy of note, I had all but given up on them. Back in the 90's I went through a phase as a movie enthusiast, particularly in horror, so I watched a lot! Dated horrors such as Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, Hellraiser, The Shining all spring to mind as a comparison to the originality of this film. It has something, an edge, an x factor that these other classics have. Finally, a writer and director who understands the true nature of what makes a good horror film isn't simply jump-scares, log cabin gore and 'found cam footage' as per the flood of horror bilge over the past twenty years. This film is a modern classic fully deserved of all the praise it gets from now and for the next thirty years. Being an occultists myself (and noted authority, not that I'm bigging myself up, just assuring you of my credentials) I am also impressed with the authenticity of the subjects, to an extent, there is a little liberty for the benefit of entertainment. The film pulls no punches, and often leaves you asking what the...? just happened? Love it!
I'm hoping Ari Aster, doesn't leave it there....I want more, same world, same cult...here take my money! I only give it 8 stars as I always like to leave room for something beyond my experience. Its top notch...and if you read my other reviews, you will quickly see positivity does not come easily from me!restored my faith that horror films can be good..thank you!",8,1,3,17 October 2018
Aquaman," The Aquaman Game
","While watching this film my sone and I devised the Aquaman game. The premise is simple. You watch this film with a timer running and a pen and notepad. Every time you see a line, concept, scene or cliche which is undeniably stolen from another film you write the time and the reference down. The person with the most wins.The whole film is just scenes from some of the most successful films of all time, strung together in some sort of 'guaranteed formula' concept of ensuring success, that patently has failed to work.
IIt'snot a bad film, it's not as terrible as people make out, but it has too many plot holes and failures to allow yourself to escape into the universe and put the faults behind you to make any real constructed frame which makes the film whole. But, no joke its like watching every film you have ever seen before strung into one, with scenes from star wars, Warcraft, harry potter, game of thrones, how to train your dragon,'King Arthur', Avatar, Finding Nemo, Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribean, Hercules....and I don't mean these are similar themes, they are full identifiable scenes!Throughout the film you question choices of rational, like why did the mother stay away so long? it tries to explain, but the answer doesnt make sense?
Overall switch your brain off and enjoy the ride, if you bother to think in the film you will quickly turn into dispising it,",4,2,3,26 January 2019
Man of Steel," SUPERMAN IS DEAD this film is KRYPTONITE
","I can see why this movie appeals to a majority of people, it has all the explosions, fighting and fast flickering none stop action that seems to satisfy people today and it has it in abundance.#I hate films which I have often reviewed as being 'pretentious' and what I like to call 'Emperors new clothes' which often get great reviews by other 'pretentious' people who like to say how much they love some arty piece of drivel so that they can appear intellectual to the rest of us, as though we missed the greatness simply because we are not intelligent enough to have understood this cinematic masterpiece. Unfortunately in a reversal of my usual standpoint, today I can't help thinking that I have become a member of the 'highbrow brigade' as Man of Steel is what I can only think of as a 'placebo of action for the in- intellectuals'. For me this film was tedious, I struggled to keep my eyes open and the character at the heart of the film wasn't Superman, it was ironman, thor or a generic super hero with a cape, who was indestructible and could fly...and nothing else. Assuming the writer 'Goyer' and the Director 'Snyder' are to blame for this debacle, what were they thinking?I cannot claim to be a comic book reader, I'm no super hero geek, and I honestly don't know whether Superman is DC or Marvel. But I do know what superman is, and this ain't it. Superman is not bolshy and tough, he is humble and meek, he doesn't allow thousands of people to die, because he is happy to push the bad guys through buildings making them collapse on the innocent public. There is a previous poster (lyre) that goes into the details of how many things are wrong with this film and I agree with every one of them. So reap what you sew those that accolade this movie, I fear is that this is the end of Superman, this film has ruined it for the future as with this being a box office success, and the great unwashed looking at it favourably. Be aware that all future Superman films will be driven by sales and money hungry corporations will say...make more like that.. so well done Snyder and Goyer..you have killed superman.one more thing to add to the nonsense reported by Lyer, how come everyone can teleport between Kansas and Whatever city 'Metropolis?' it's supposed to be set in, seems superman and his foes push each other through countless collapsing buildings, up floors and be back and too between the desert, space, the city in a matter of seconds, to always have Lois Lane to rescue, or follow them up the stairs and be at the centre of the action...Is she super too?You may well applaud this film now, but give it a couple of years and watch it on the same day as the classic Christopher Reeve version and you will then see how lacking in substance and Superman ethics this horrible horrible film was. Superman Returns Also was much better.",3,10,17,21 July 2013
Wanted," Great film...for single cell organisms
","There is something about this film that makes it not quite the most ridiculous awful film you could watch, its a fun romp with some great names and interesting cast who were made for action films. Everything else is just awful, you could write the script 10 seconds before the characters speak, the writing is that obvious, I never liked matrix, but at least matrix bothered to explain why people could do impossible actions by taking outside a physical world, this writer and director would have you just believe some people are just really 'Duh..Awsome'. Its not possible to write a spoiler on this film, trust me its so clichéd you have seen this film under every action film imaginable. if this film did not have effects and budget, it would be the biggest embarrassment to some distinguished careers. If it wasn't for the violence...kids would love it, if your over eight years of age you might want something a little more substantial to watch.",2,5,13,8 August 2008
The Favourite," Hype over substance
","A disappointing film, I honestly cannot see what everybody's is banging on about.
Seemingly filmed on security cameras with wide angled lenses which distorted the vision, cut with on obtuse period of a single piano key alternating a beat with a rusty saw being played with a violin bow, this fastly became the most uncomfortable film I have ever had to endure. I noticed that I was physically furrowing my brow in subconscious distain for the filming. Which spent too long in the beginning jumping around between the characters for you to comfortably establish any sense of direction.
Nothing original in the script, typical follies of the period, a little jealousy and skullduggery between rising factions of the established order and the new. The film seemed to make its entire story based on those simple concepts that are usually an overplayed stereotype in all royal household films...pick any, it's there...how this became such a phenomena eludes me entirely. Olivia Coleman, whome I love, was wonderful, but her character which was a version of blackadders queen Elizabeth but with a weaker temperament and vulnerability.
It seems that when we brits make a period drama, which is nothing more than a film for tv, some forces come into play which destine all concerned for globes, oscars and awards that are totally undeserved. It just proves the sewn up, hypocrisy and old boy network that these awards really are.. they need scraping and replacing with genuine, unprogramed awards for invocation, creativity and delivery...not yet another rehash of a period drama, or holocuast cliche that seem to be guaranteed award candidates by the mere fact of making them.",4,1,5,12 January 2019
Gran Torino," Mediocre at best
","I think we really need to balance this film, which is not bad, it wasn't as good as some make out, Clint needs to realise that He's not a tough guy anymore, the punching of the cupboards shows frailty, and while I'd not knock this legend, its a bit like watching the 50 years old women in their Britney spears ghetups, they still have style of their own at the age they are at, stop trying to relive the long gone past, you would look better in clothes to suit, come on Clint, play to ALL your attributes. and while it shows that yes this racist, stuck in his ways old tough guy who is stuck in the past, can befriend the 'gooks' so he is not all bad, this just allows this onslaught of verbal insults to have a purpose...they do not, Don't get me wrong I'm no PC prude, I'm as bigoted as most, and believe there is a balance to political correctness...this just seems to give ammo to those with no reason for disliking a race to just say 'yes but thats just the way I am, I mean no harm'....while doing harm. you should watch this film, its good...but no masterpiece.",5,13,41,14 December 2008
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Last Jedi - Lets hope so!
","To say this was a peice of crap is to insult all the great craps I have had in my life.I have two points to make here. one about the film, and secondly to support the people complaining about the credibility of IMDB in its ratings. you only have to look at the reviews to know that something is awry with a HUGE majority of people giving this 1* to attempt to give people a true notion of this film. 
Back to the film. Currently with a rating of 7*+ on IMDB, despite...well Ive gone down two pages and not seen a positive review or one that scored more than 4, I suspect shenanigans. When Disney first got this franchise I thought, oh well, there goes Star Wars, but I ate my words, they did a great job previously.But this, this is EXACTLY everything you thought Disney would do wrong with the franchise.I can see the scriptwriters now at the beginning of this project. A bunch of 30 something marketing executives who simply have not lived a world where star wars is almost like a right of passage.One sparks up, ok 'Empire Strikes Back Was the greatest Star Wars film of all time, lets watch it and do that again!'
they sat and watched it, quite possibly their first star wars experience and then in fan fiction style took all the elements, juggled them around and applied it to new characters. most of the poorly sequenced bits can be recognised as bits from the original films, we have a new Lando Calrisian character, who does what lando does. we have a Snow battle, but in salt...we have brother sister connections.., we have betrayal....... and then we have....'put the characters in a scenario where they run out of options and all hope is lost, and then as luck would have it, someone turns up to save the day'...repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat...and keep repeating as that is ALL you have for the film, change scenario, change the characters as it darts between expositions and has split the story into a weave of subplots each with their own duo. throw in some weird love triangle between Rey, Finn and the new 'Token asian' IMO Rose.so many things wrong its hard to avoid spoilers by avoiding specifics.
All goes well until 'That Scene'...you'll know it when you see it, but I'll just say 'superman scene', only those who have seen the film will get it. from there out its downhill all the way.Oh, and if you didnt like JaJa Binks...get ready for merchandise overload. In classic disney fashion. They have toys galore going to poor out of this and I hope they have pre-ordered billions of them, and that the public see this film and its merchandise for what it really is..not worth your time. To leave this film as Carrie Fishers legacy, well words cannot express how angry I am. And I think most of the world will share this sentiment. The producer, directors and writers should never be allowed near a studio again.if disney had any sense of moral decency they should give this franchise away to anyone else, anyone in the world.is there a single positive?
A couple of jokes, were well placed.
Some sentimental speeches in light of Carrie's passing were well placed.
Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), stole the show, wasnt keen on him in the last one, didnt think he suited the role. In this he really showed he could have been a great new Darth Vader. If I ever watch another one?Wooden Oscar to Domhnall Gleeson..seriously dude! I know the lines were terrible, but it was almost like watching a school nativity where you played joseph.I say from the bottom of my heart, there was so much wrong with this film, anything they got right was smothered. Please do not go to the cinema and pay cinema prices to see this garbage, even die hard fans, wait till its on TV. A message needs to be sent from the fans.",1,1,2,19 December 2017
The Conjuring," Yawn !!!
","How many times can they hash out the same old tripe. I struggle to class this as a spoiler as...If you have ever seen a film where a family move into a detached old house with a cobwebbed filled attic/cellar, where the dog won't come in and the someone first catches a glimpse in the mirror, the father tries to rationalise when all his family are screaming monster in the cupboard/wardrobe/cellar/attic/under the bed...yada yada yada. well this is yet another one of those films, nothing to see here, move along. The only credit I can give to this unimaginative template of a horror film, just change character names and some dialogue..and bingo a new Hollywood horror film right out of the scripts of the seventies...anyway the credit, a sterling (if a bit stereotypical of the girl who sees the monster as her imaginary friend...yes it has that old chestnut too) performance from Mackenzie Foy, the little girl who seems to have 20 years acting experience over that of Ron Livingston who's about as wooden as an oak tree's morning glory.",2,66,125,7 August 2013
