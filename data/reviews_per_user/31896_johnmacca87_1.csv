Changeling," Outstanding film!!!! Deserved to be nom for best film!!!
","I had never heard about this true story that the film was based on, but as soon as I saw the preview for the film I straight away wanted to see it. There was something about it the acting looked top notch and how can you go wrong with Clint Eastwood directing?With a 2h 30min run time I was un shore if I would get bored with the film, but I did not the film grabs you from get go and takes you through the horrible things that Christine Collins went through. The film was shocking to think that things like this happened in the early 1900's. The acting was near perfection Angelina Jolie was absolute breathtaking she made you fell her pain and the stress she was going through, and John Malcovich was good like always. So if you like films based on true stories and you like a movie that makes you think than I would go no further than Challenging because this movie well be in my top 10 movies of this year.",8,4,6,6 February 2009
