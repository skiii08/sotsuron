It," Lack of Chemistry
","Stephen King understands children. His works have always brought together outsiders into their own cliques as shield against the evil elements of life and death. I felt no chemistry among the children, no forever bonds. The lack of character depth were disappointing. Changing Mike Hanlon from intellectual to livestock butcher was a disservice to the entire plot line. Beverly Marsh kidnapping distorted the plot line for IT: Chapter Two. Stephen King's works are rich in characters, plots and terror. In the end this Pennywise was a bore and I did not care if they all lived or died in the sewer.",3,0,3,10 March 2019
