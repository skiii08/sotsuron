The Blair Witch Project," In 1994 three Idiots go in to the woods.
","Totally unscary, and the three nimrods are so stupid that after an hour in to the movie you don't care if they get killed, you're just wishing they would die already, but it just drags on and on, a lot like this sentence. The way this movie end cements the stupidity of these people. If this was real you'd be glad there are three less idiots in the world.What saves the movie is the low budget artistic style in which it is filmed. Hay I got a video camera. . .!See 'The Curse of the Blair Witch' It's much better and makes this flem, I mean film a lot better.",4,0,1,15 June 2000
Antz," A real bugs life!
","A good spoof of human pecking order, 'STARSHIP TROOPERS' from the bugs point of view, and road movies.  These Ants would eat the ants, grass hoppers and the rest of the bugs from 'Bugs Life' for lunch, except for Z because he is probably a vegetarian.",9,0,0,5 July 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars: Mars Attacks part 2
","George Lucus just remade mars attacks in part with the same actor Nataly Portmen.  The rest of the movie is just a set up for the next episodes, but has very little plot.  The high points are the pod race, the voyage under sea, and the battle at the end.George should consult more of the novel writers on the next two, to avoid remaking the same old movie again.  This is what we waited 20 years for? Wasn't worth it.",7,0,0,2 July 2000
Chicken Run," Battle Field Chicken Coop . . . So who wants PIE?
","There's nothing worse than dry Chicken, and this is really dry.  This is a remake of the 'Great Escape' told from the P. O. V. of chickens. See the original instead. The problem is they're CHICKENS!, so who cares if they escape or not.  All this movie did for me is make me hungry for chicken pot pie.  The creators of this Show should stick to shorts that have one or two chuckles, instead of a full length movie with one or two chuckle.  I guess brain dead children (The only kids that could sit through this whole thing) and people with a thing for clay (Which by the votes is a lot) will like this movie. The only reason I gave it a 5 was there was nothing offensive in it, and it was cute(whoopty do!)",5,0,3,31 December 2000
X-Men," X-actly what I was waiting for.
","Like any good movie series the first has very little plot and a lot of character development.Patrick Stewart, Hally Berry, and Anna Paquinn, are here just to have stars on the marque.  It's the unknown actors that stand out and give the best performances, and Ian always makes a good bad guy. Maybe if film was longer, they might have fleshed out the characters more, or make you feel for the more, but hopefully the next one will fill any plot holes and give the stars more to do.Oh yea, lets have Gambit in the next one.  He was missed.",8,0,0,14 July 2000
The Patriot," The Best Movie on the Revolutionary War I've seen.
","This movie gets you on every emotion.  They've finally made a movie that shows you every thing that our forefathers suffered to form this nation, with out bashing you over the head with gore, and hoped up propaganda.It might be one of the best ever made.  Up there with Gone With the Wind.You'll laugh, and you'll cry as the hero's live and die.  We must never forget the cost of freedom.",10,11,18,29 June 2000

A Bug's Life," Even the kids get board. The Horror! The Horror!
","Loser ant tries to save his friends from opressive grasshoppers, by hiring a 'Magnificent Seven' of circus bugs that he thinks are warriors.The good guys are so stupid, and pathetic that you want the grasshoppers to win. Their seens are the only ones worth watching.Just one of many 'Magnificent Seven' remakes/spoofs this year.  The Three Amigos did it better in 1986 as far as spoofs go.Just another Disney's Sh** don't stink movie, which every one with out an opinion of their own liked.  But that is just my opinion.",2,4,21,8 July 2000
The Green Mile," Are you sure I. P. Freely didn't write this one.
","I don't wish to spoil any thing but in this movie an innocent man on death row heals people with his mouth, except 'Thankfully' when it comes to Tom Hanks' bladder condition.  That's just one of the many plot holes in this silly movie full of hidden jokes. Did you here about the one where a guy in prison that trains a mouse to tricks on command.  Well when the mouse is finally fully trained, the mouse dies and the guy is put to death. So what was the point, except to fill time in an all ready to long movie. Maybe I mist the point, because with all the urinating going on in the movie I had to go to the restroom myself.",6,0,1,29 June 2000
Tarzan," Disney's flat animation falls flat again.
","Disney's live action and animation in the past few years(with the exception of the Toy Story movies) just seams like they're not trying to come up with an engaging plot any more.  Instead they put some cool colors on the screen and think that's all you need to spend your money on. 
That's the problem with a lot of movies now days, but in Disney's case they don't think their Sh** stinks, and nether do the critics or movie going public.  They think as long as it has Disney on it, it can't be bad.  Unless it's a really good one like Pocahontas, that goes over their heads, then the movie going public hates it, just because the critics tell them to.The studios are not in the business to make good quality movies, but to make money, and as long as the public will buy the cool colors, big bangs, and one liners, the independent artist will get all the awards, and the studios will keep making dumb movies like this one.",5,0,4,2 July 2000
