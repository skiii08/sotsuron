Alien 3," BORING....
","I don't know about you, when I go to see a movie, I expect to be entertained. I expect to be told a story. I expect the flimmakers to give me characters to care about, or at least hold my interest, and events on-screen that give me a reason to keep paying attention and not start thinking about having sex with various cartoon charecters. Unfortunately this movie is horrible and boring. I'm seroius - just about nothing happens, and the few things that DO happen are various people I just met and don't care about getting killed. Whoop dee doo. This movie completely failed to hold my attention, and I almost fast-forwarded at several points... which isn't how an Alien movie should be. I don't know what people see in this one, but it's horrible. Don't see it, ever.",Null,300,322,20 October 2000
