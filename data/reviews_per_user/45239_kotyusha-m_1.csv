Catch Me If You Can," Too young or too old?
","Striving for something must give a result. This is especially true for people who are stubborn. And it doesn't matter to them how much they have to endure, what difficulties and boundaries to cross, because the main thing is to reach the end point, that is, to achieve result.But many still can not get what they want. Why so? The answer to this may lie either in a banal laziness, or in another misfortune - the conquest of the unbeaten.The main character of this film was able to please in the second paradox. In short, he wanted the fact that at that time it was simply not possible. But not so much, he demanded: he wanted to live happily, like most. But what can you do about your parents' divorce? What can you do about the imperfection of the rights of American citizens, who suck all the money out of their beloved father? Many would be humbled, but not Frank. Choosing the right moment, when everyone was in another room, he ran away with a desire to find a way to the old life and fulfillment of all his dreams.In general, the whole film is focused on this, the most important and most amazing character. What is it amazing, at first incomprehensible. At least in appearance, he appears to us as a typical 16-year-old boy who loves parents and life. But that was for the time being. It can be seen, and in truth, it is said that only a difficult situation determines who we really are. Jack, being once again in a similar, showed himself as a man of a dozen timid, who would hardly just accept disaster. And it seems to be a great advance, but when the usual striving turns into a navischevuyu idea, the bad can not be avoided. Of course, in dreams, he really believed that if he earned more money and became a worthy man, his mother would take it, but would marry his father again, and they would live quietly and peacefully. In fact, it turned out that it would not be possible to quickly become someone significant, so I had to play someone, in the literal sense. From such a 'game' there were problems with the law, the eternal bustle and, finally, the realization that he is nobody. Why, and with the parents did not work.However, in all this minus you can find a handful of plus: Frank for such a small period managed to go into the skin, count several people at once. And let him pay for this with complete solitude, yet in the ability to crank it all up and consist, for the most part, its difference from others, its peculiarity.
This concerns the most fundamental character. I doubt that he would have become so without the help of the one who brought it to life - Leonardo DiCaprio. Here is his finest hour: he now and then put on various masks. But probably the best he managed to show complete hopelessness, the realization that all dreams have collapsed. And this intersection of the image of the usual 'waking up', 'matured' boy and the image of the genius of a mozyinik create something unrealistically huge in terms of acting and plot. Also, at the height of the one who caught the whole film Frank - Karl Henratti, in the performance of Tom Hanks. I was surprised at how different he appears to the audience at the beginning and at the end of the film.As for the plot, it turned out pretty twisted and interesting. Here, and morality, and the essence, and humor, and drama. In short everything that Spielberg loves so much is the director of the project.
So what is the result: a person who has an extraordinary gift to adapt to the role of anyone, a detective, whose 'scent' amazes and the action itself, where both humor and drama are surprisingly well balanced. In a word, 'Catch Me If You Can' is an ideal film that will suit both the younger and the younger generation.",10,1,2,19 February 2019
