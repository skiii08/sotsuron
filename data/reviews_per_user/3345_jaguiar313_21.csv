Insidious: Chapter 2," Insidious sequel is spooky fun.
","Insidious: Chapter 2 starts up almost right after the original Insidious ended with Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Renai (Rose Byrne) Lambert reunited with their son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) after his spirit was held prisoner by a demon in an afterlife dimension called 'The Further'. But, as we saw in the final frames, something else was now inhabiting Josh's body and it had strangled paranormal investigator Elise (Lin Shaye) to death. We pick up as the unsuspecting family, including older son Foster (Andrew Astor) and their infant daughter Kali, have moved in with Josh's mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) while police investigate Elise's mysterious death in their house. They are barely moved in when supernatural occurrences start to begin again with objects moving, spectral voices, apparitions appearing and dear old dad acting very strange. While Renai tries to deal with the fact that supernatural forces are still with them, Josh tries to convince her all is well and Lorraine decides to team up with Elise's former assistants paranormal investigators Specs (Leigh Whannell who also wrote the screenplay) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) along with one of the original investigators from Josh's childhood haunting, Carl (Steve Coulter) to get down to the bottom of these haunted hi-jinx once and for all. And that is all I will say about the story as, despite some familiar trappings, James Wan (The Conjuring) takes this installment in some clever directions and once again uses the familiar elements very well. We get to know the story behind the evil woman in black seen in the last film and even revisit The Further though, this time it is inventively linked to events in the first film. The pace is a bit slower and more methodical this time round but, since this film is a bit of a mystery as well as haunting, it takes it's time to let the story unfold and secrets be revealed. We still get some spooky scenes but, it is refreshingly mixed in with Lorraine and co's equally goose bump inducing investigation. And what they find is deviously fun. The film is not quite as lively as Insidious part one but, I liked the mystery element and the film earned points with me for using it's return to 'The Further' a bit more clever and less silly then last time. That is the point where the first film lost it's grip on me and here I like how it was done and was with this supernatural chiller up to the spooky end. Wan is a good director and he takes what could have been a ho-hum retread and makes it a fun follow-up. He gets good performances out of all his cast and while I found Patrick Wilson to be bland in both Insidious and The Conjuring, he gets a far more lively performance out of him here. He gets to ham it up a bit and it suits him. The film has some beautiful and creepy visuals, as is Wan's trademark, and Joseph Bishara's score adds some nice atmosphere too. So in conclusion, while the story elements are more familiar; we've seen some of it before and the pace a bit slower, Wan does give us a spooky mystery to add to the paranormal activity and makes much more clever use of his otherworldly 'Further'. He also gives us some clever answers to the questions left by his first Insidious and that all adds up to a spooky fun time at the movies. Also stars House Of The Devil's Joceline Donahue as young Lorraine in some equally clever flashback sequences that tie into the rest of the film in a fun way.",Null,5,7,13 September 2013
Men in Black 3," Fun second sequel to the 1997 classic
","MIB3 is a fun second sequel to Barry Sonnenfield's classic 1997 comedy about a secret government agency that handles all things extraterrestrial. In this installment one of Agent K's (Tommy Lee Jones) past enemies, Boris The Animal (Jemaine Clement) escapes his lunar prison and goes back in time to eliminate K's existence and stop the deployment of an Earth defense shield. Now that K's is been wiped from the timeline and Earth open to attack, Agent J (Will Smith) has to travel back to 1969 and stop Boris and return K and the timeline back to it's order. And to do this he needs help from the 1969 version of K (Josh Brolin). While it lacks the magic of the original MIB, part 3 is a lot more entertaining then the forgettable part 2 and it's fun to see the team back in action after 10 years. The film is obviously not perfect. The villain is a bit bland, there are a few slow spots and the plot does keep Smith and Jones apart for a good portion of the film. In fact Jones' part is almost an extended cameo with Brolin, who is very good as the young K, getting most of the screen time. But, there is a lot of fun to be had and the cast, also including Emma Thompson as new boss 'O' and Alice Eve as her younger version, all have a good time and Will Smith even gives J more of an air of now being a veteran in the organization then the rookie we last saw. The FX are top notch and Danny Elfman returns to scoring duties as Sonnenfield returns to the director's chair. Not a classic like the original but, a fun enjoyable sequel that makes one forget the misstep that was MIB2.",7,0,2,30 November 2012
The Expendables 2," Flawed but still fun action sequel.
","Expendables 2 is a fun follow-up to the 2010 eighties action throwback hit that isn't quite as engaging in it's quieter moments as the previous flick but, thankfully there aren't too many of those. This installment finds the gang being sent by the mysterious Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) after a downed plane in Eastern Europe to recover the contents of an on board safe. Along for the ride is Maggie (Yu Nan), a tech specialist and new sniper, Billy (Liam Hemsworth). But, they are intercepted by a gang of armed thugs headed by the cold blooded Villain (Jean-Claude Van Damme) and henchman Hector( Scott Adkins) who take their quarry and kill one of the team. Now it's personal as Barney (Stallone) and Co. seek to track down Villain and put him down. Along for the bullet-ridden ride are old rival Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger), Mr. Church and legendary 'Lone Wolf' mercenary Booker (Chuck Norris). When the action is flying fast and furious, EX2 is a real blast. It's great to see Arnold, Van Damme and Norris back on screen doing what they do best. Van Damme in particular seems to be having fun chewing up the Eastern European scenery as the lethal bad guy and he doesn't get enough screen time, sadly, to really establish the character's full menace. Aside from an overuse of CGI blood, director Simon West gives us some good, old-fashioned rip-roaring action scenes that fit the retro action icon cast perfectly and some good hand to hand combat as well. Although some of those, especially Stallone v.s. Van Damme, could have gone on a bit longer to give them more dramatic intensity. And drama is where West stumbles. The scenes between the action, which should be engaging and strong to keep us involved until the bullets fly again, are rather ho-hum. The dramatic scenes, though few, needed some energy, some 'POP'. The camaraderie between the team members that Stallone captured so well in part 1 is weak here and because of that we are less forgiving of the cheesy dialog and the characters are less engaging because of it. Perfect example is Lundgren's Gunner who practically stole the flick first time around, is nowhere near as fun as in EX1 and the fun Statham/ Stallone relationship is also weaker. The in-between scenes also had a quicker pace under Stallone's direction last time and thus we were able to overlook the plot holes easier. But, this is an action film and there is plenty of that and who is in action is why we sat in our seat and on that level Expendables 2 delivers on what we came to see. I am all for Expendables 3 but, find a director that can put some energy in the drama, give the team their team spirit back and a writer who can give them some livelier banter... as well as deliver the carnage.",7,1,11,17 August 2012
Skyfall," Both charmingly familiar and yet boldly treads new ground.
","Skyfall is a very interesting and entertaining entry in this 50 year old series in that it gives us all the classic elements that we've come to expect from a Bond film and yet, takes it into new and unexpected territory. Not everyone is going to like where it goes but, I certainly did. The story is actually quite simple. After a mission goes awry, 007 (Daniel Craig) is thought dead but, is actually living in secret, drowning the negative effects of his job with sex and booze. But, when a mysterious and sinister individual targets MI6 and M (Dame Judi Dench) in particular, Bond returns to action despite doubts from some of his superiors that he still can handle the job. Writers Robert Wade, Neal Purvis and John Logan craft a story that is part spy thriller and part Silence Of The Lambs as Bond faces not a villainous organization or government but, one very dangerous and psychotic ex-MI6 agent known as Silva (Javier Bardem) who is bent on avenging what he feels is a betrayal by his former boss, M. It's a daring direction to give this Bond film a more personal focus despite it's scope and having Bond defending, not Queen and Country but, the one person he can even remotely consider family, M, from a man whose motives for revenge are equally personal. And director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road To Perdition) is more then up to the task. Mendes gives the film the epic scope we've come to expect from these moves as the film travels from Turkey to Shanghai and from Macau to London and Scotland but, never looses focus on the characters or story. He directs the action in a refreshingly old fashion manner, no more evident then in the thrilling train set pre-credit sequence. No quick cuts or shaky-cam, just good intense action. The action is what's exciting, not the camera or editing tricks used to make it exciting. He gets great performances out of his cast. Craig is sensational as a Bond who is a bit burnt-out and bitter yet, is driven by duty and loyalty to return to a life he has a chance to escape a life that maybe is right for him after all. Bardem is simply brilliant as the demented and dangerous yet, disturbingly flamboyant, Silva. A man who is Bond's equal in many way's but, is demented by his inner pain and thirst for revenge. Dame Judi Dench is great in an expanded role for M. She and Craig are magic together and it's great to see them share so many scenes after Quantum Of Solace kept them apart for almost that entire film. The supporting cast including Naomie Harris (Eve). Ralph Fiennes (Mallory) and Ben Whishaw (a young, computer geek-ish Q) are all excellent and provide great support for the principles. Mendes makes this flick look great with some stunning camera work such as the Blade Runner-esque Shanghai and the moody moors of Scotland. The film is deliberately paced but, it is more thriller then action flick although, there is plenty of the latter. Round that out with a very Bond score by Thomas Newman, a classic Bond theme by Adele and one of the best opening credits sequences in some time and you have a solid James Bond flick that is both charmingly familiar and yet boldly treads new ground. Bravo!",8,2,10,9 November 2012
Gravity," A virtual masterpiece of suspense as two stranded astronauts fight to survive.
","Gravity isn't just a good film, it is a great film. I have been watching movies for well over 4 decades and this might have been one of the most emotionally harrowing film experiences I have ever had. I rarely use the word masterpiece but, if this isn't one, it's damn close and as close to a perfect movie as I've seen in a long time. Gravity's story is simple, a crew of 5 astronauts in the space shuttle Explorer are working on additions to the Hubble Telescope. Mid-mission they receive news that the Russians have destroyed one of their own satellites with a missile test and debris has been sent rocketing close to their proximity news which becomes a dire warning as the satellite debris has impacted other satellites and now a cloud of wreckage is heading right for them at an increasing velocity and they have moments to abort their mission and get out of harm's way. Despite their efforts to get out of danger, the debris hits them full on and only Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), who is on his last mission, are left alive tethered together with with Kowalski's jet propulsion pack running out of power and Stone running out of air. Can they reach the International Space Station and before the cloud of debris orbits Earth and returns? And if they do, are they even safe there? Co-written (with Jonás Cuarón) and directed by Alfonso Cuarón, Gravity is 90 minutes of one of the most emotionally gripping and suspenseful movie going experiences you're likely to have as he quickly establishes two very likable human beings who are put in one of the most frightening scenarios one can imagine. Cuarón not only gives us two people to root and care for but, his masterful camera work and the flawless SPFX create a vast and frightening void that is as beautiful as it is intimidating. One false move and you can be lost in the vast empty coldness and with no air and no one coming to your rescue. Cuarón uses a lot of POV and stunning camera shots to put us in space right there with our two stranded astronauts and we experience what they do and feel their fear every step of the way. Not to mention that the Children Of Men filmmaker gets two Oscar worthy performances out of Clooney and Bullock and these veteran actors create two very endearing three dimensional characters we embrace all the way and are right along with in experiencing every heartbreaking setback and grasping every glimmer of hope. The film is truly an emotional roller coaster ride that most movies promise but, few can actually deliver. By the time the credits rolled I felt I had been through everything the characters had and thanks to Cuarón's skillful directing and wonderful script, I had. An exhilarating, harrowing and wonderfully suspenseful movie that is more then just a film, it's an experience. A must see movie! Best film of year for me and doubt I will see anything as powerful for some time.",10,6,12,7 October 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Fun and action packed sequel, though not quite trek 09
","t's been a 4 year mission to wait for a sequel to J.J. Abrams' awesome Star Trek reboot but, finally Star Trek Into Darkness has arrived. And while it's not quite up to the 2009 blockbuster, it is still a really entertaining 2 hours at the movies. The film opens with Kirk (Chris Pine) disobeying Starfleet's Prime Directive to save a primitive alien race and his Vulcan first officer, Spock (Zachary Quinto). When the Enterprise reaches Earth, instead of being handed the much coveted 5 year mission, Kirk is handed a demotion and Pike resumes command of the good ole NCC 1701. But, this speed-bump in Kirk's career doesn't last as a mysterious rogue Starfleet agent by the name of John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) launches deadly terroristic attacks against Starfleet and it's personnel. His actions put Kirk once again in the captain's chair with orders to hunt this dangerous fugitive down, on the Klingon home world of Kronos to where he's fled, and eliminate him. But, Kirk is not comfortable being an assassin and he and his and crew find that once they enter Klingon space and retrieve their quarry, that 'John Harrison' is not who they think he is and they may be pawns in a greater conspiracy involving a Starfleet Admiral (Peter Weller) with a monstrous warship and his own agenda. Star Trek Into Darkness is a fun and fast paced action adventure that's only real problem is that it moves a little too fast and we'd like a little more time to allow the emotions of the events witnessed to resonate. Kirk's demotion is a good example as he is back in command in about 10 minutes of screen time and we really don't get a chance to appreciate this blow to the character's career and ego. Once the plot starts to unfold, the film is all too eager to get to the explosions and fisticuffs then to give us a few minutes to properly absorb the dramatic effects of what occurs. But, I would be lying if I said that what action Abrams delivers is not exciting and fun because, it is. This is especially true during an exhilarating last act which made up for some of the lack of real emotional depth earlier on. The script from Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof has it weaknesses but, ultimately I did like their twist on a familiar Trek character and how the new time line effected his involvement in Trek history. The cast is once again top notch and it is the involvement between characters that really helps keep this movie on target during some of the weaker bits. The combination of Abrams' direction, the script's character interaction and the cast, really give this film it's strength despite all the awesome action and eye popping SPFX. All the crew return from Trek 09 and are all really good, once again, at making these classic characters their own yet, still familiar. Trek's bad guy is played with relish by Benedict Cumberbatch, giving a strong performance as the main villain, though I just wish his character had a bit more screen time to be developed a bit more, to really appreciate and give the character more weight. And it's great to see Peter Wellar back on the big screen as Admiral Marcus, the Starfleet officer whose visions of war with the Klingon Empire have caused him to act against the very things he seeks to defend. And pretty Alice Eve is fine as Carol Marcus, the admiral's daughter and future Kirk love interest. The character has little to do for the most part but, Eve does well when Miss Marcus does become important to the plot. So in conclusion, I had a fun time watching this Trek sequel and while I wish it had a little more emotional depth in the first two acts and a little more development of some of the new characters, their is plenty of warp speed action to entertain and the film really delivers in the final act where it counts. Beam me up for Trek 3!",7,1,11,16 May 2013
Underworld Awakening," Selene returns in bloody fun 4th adventure
","As a fan of the Underworld series I was both eager and apprehensive about this 4th installment but, as the credits rolled I had a smile on my face and had a good time. For starters, Kate Beckinsale is back in black latex returning as Death Dealer Selene. The story opens as man has discovered both lycan and vampire and Selene has been separated from Michael, captured and cryogenically frozen as the war to cleanse the world of these supernatural species is underway. When released 12 years later, Selene finds a police state where lycan and vampire are all but extinct and she has a 12 year old daughter who's unique nature makes her central to a sinister experiment. To save her daughter and her people, Selene finds herself with unexpected enemies and allies and that's just fine with her. At barely 90 minutes Underworld: Awakening is all about the action and there is plenty of it. It slows down to give us some story here and there and is surprisingly good at utilizing the time to move it along without stopping the momentum and the film does move quite fast. Selene is thrust into doing what she does best quite regularly and it is fairly well staged and gruesome at times. The only real weakness here is the CGI which was never very strong in this series. Otherwise it's a brisk, fast paced fun time which won't convert any new fans but, should please those there are. Sure we wish we got to know some of the new character's a bit better such as Charles Dance's vampire elder filling the void of Bill Nighy's Victor and Steven Rea's bad guy scientist with a secret is a fairly generic villain. But, there are enough gun fights, explosions, spurting blood and shots of Kate Beckinsale's perfectly shaped black latex wrapped butt to keep everyone well entertained till the final scene which hints that the sexy and lethal vampiress may not be hanging up her guns or fetish gear quite yet. And that's fine with me.",7,3,11,20 January 2012
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Amusing fairy tale based flick could have used a bit more fun to make it really click.
","When you go to see a movie called Hansel And Gretel: Witch Hunters, obviously you don't go in expecting Shakespeare but, I did expect it to have a bit more of the giddy fun that Tommy Wirkola brought to his gory zombie blast, Dead Snow. And while I was amused and entertained by H&G, it actually took itself a little too seriously for a film about fairy tale characters grown up to be vengeful witch hunters. With an outlandish story like this, I can appreciate giving the material some respect and not making a joke out of it but, to really make it work you have to give it a bit more over the top like Wirkola did so well with Dead Snow. H&G has action that is bloody and fast moving but, the film needed a bit more of a sense of humor then a few curse laden quips and breaking the same person's nose, twice. This story of the fairy tale siblings coming up against a very powerful witch (Famke Janssen) with a devious plot to free her kind from the dangers of fire resembles the far more ridiculous Van Helsing to a degree but, could have used a bit of that flick's over the top energy, just not as out of control (though that does make VH a 'so bad it's good' treat). The film is well done and uses a lot more practical effects then expected and the minimal use of CGI was very refreshing. The cast handles their parts very well with Renner and Arterton having a good time as the bad ass witch killers and they played their roles with a serious approach but, not without a quick wink every now and then to let you know they are having a good time. Famke Janssen plays her part as the formidable witch with some over the top relish and that made a nice contrast to her stoic adversaries. Rounding out the cast Peter Stormare isn't given much to do as the town sheriff who is not happy that H&G have come to do his job but, he is more lively here then in The Last Stand. The film looks great. The sets and costumes are really nicely designed as are the various witches and their Troll, Edward (Derek Mears). The cinematography is lush and the locations beautiful. Visually this is a really cool flick. But, as said, Wirkola gives us a fast pace and some nice gory action scenes to entertain us but, he just needed to inject a little more fun in the proceedings to make this a real standout treat. Overall I did enjoy it but, it could have been so much more of a blast if Wirkola wasn't trying a bit too hard to not turn the material into a joke. There is a fine line to making a movie like this and Dead Snow proves he can walk it just fine. So why didn't he? An amusing enough viewing but, kinda forgettable when all is said and done.",6,0,2,1 February 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," A flawed film elevated by Garfield and a terrific last act.
","I liked Raimi's Spider-man movies, especially the first two. So, I was a bit apprehensive about The Amazing Spider-Man but, went in to this reboot with an open mind. And while there are problems here and the film has flaws, it also has great potential and Andrew Garfield does a terrific job delivering a fresh take on Peter Parker/Spidey. Since my biggest problem was with the retelling of the origin, that bodes well for the next movie if done right. The problem I had with the origin is not that it is done differently but, to be honest, I don't think it really clicked. It seemed clunky and awkward and it just didn't grab me. They were trying to bring together elements concerning Parker's father and Peter himself into the main story and it seemed a bit forced, it didn't drag me in. Another part of the origin that didn't work for me was his relationship with his Uncle Ben. As Uncle Ben is also an important part of Peter's transformation, their relationship needed to be stronger and I never got a sense of how important they were to each other. One of the reasons is, I felt that the usually terrific Martin Sheen was miscast here. He just doesn't give Ben the charm and quiet strength that Cliff Robertson brought in the Raimi trilogy that made his importance to Peter believable. Their relationship isn't given much screen time and It never strongly establishes their bond. Sally Field's Aunt May fairs better although, once the plot is in full swing, she doesn't get to do more then look concerned as Peter comes home at odd hours with some battle scars from his superhero activities. The film really doesn't come together and really start to work till Parker begins to establish himself as Spider-Man and his relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) starts to form. Here director Marc Webb (A guy named Webb directs a Spider-Man movie, how's that for a happy accident.) really brings it together and delivers. Garfield and Stone are great together and have a great chemistry. Stone is far more interesting then Dunst as Mary Jane and makes a far better match for Peter and a far spunkier heroine who doesn't stand on the sidelines waiting to be captured by the villain of the week. Gwen gives Peter a much needed emotional positivity in his troubled life and it's easy to believe that she gives him the strength to be a true hero and much more then just a wisecracking vigilante. Not that that stage isn't fun too. Rhys Ifans is fine as the noble Dr. Curt Connors whose quest to better the lives of the handicapped, including himself, leads to his emergence as the Lizard. Connors could have been a bit more threatening to a degree but, it worked for me that his core intentions were still good despite being twisted by the Lizard's rage and the maddening effects of the serum. He wants to turn us all into lizards with the best of intentions. And his CGI alter ego was impressive and came across as a dangerous foe for our freshman superhero. The numerous confrontations between the two were well done and escalated nicely till the big finale which really soars and Webb surprises us with how well he presented the action. And let us not forget a really good turn by Denis Leary as Gwen's dad, Captain Stacy. He has minimal screen time but, gives us a well rounded characterization that adds importance and weight to the scenes he's in. This is what Sheen failed to do for me, was make an impression and add depth to the story in the few scenes he was in. And I have always liked Sheen. So in conclusion, after a weak and somewhat clunky first act, the movie comes together and gives us what we came for. Andrew Garfield shines as the troubled yet brilliant Peter Parker and successfully takes an awkward teen and transforms him into a noble hero and gives us a fresh new take on a familiar character that we can't wait to see more of. There was spectacular action and drama and at the core a strong relation ship between Peter and Gwen that we also want to see more of. So, while Amazing Spider-Man is a flawed film, it's potential for the future of this new direction has us anticipating what comes next now that the characters and their possible directions are established. Bring it on!... and stay during the credits folks!",7,2,5,3 July 2012
Django Unchained," Fiercely entertaining Spaghetti Western homage from Tarantino
","Quentin Tarantino has become one of America's most innovative filmmakers in that he takes his unapologetic love of movies, B movies in particular, and crafts original films out of bits and pieces that pay homage to the movies he loves. No more obvious then his latest ode to the Spaghetti Western, Django Unchained. This epic story of ex-slave turned bounty hunter, Django (Jaime Foxx) has it's main character named after the lone gunslinger played by Franco Nero in Sergio Corbucci's classic Spaghetti Western of the same name. And in case you didn't get that point, not only does the film open with that 1966 film's theme song but, sports a delightful cameo from Franco Nero himself. The story opens with a slave, Django being bought in a humorously violent scene by German bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz ( Christoph Waltz). Schultz promises Django his freedom if the slave will help him track down three wanted men Django has seen but, Schultz has not. But, Django has quite a knack for bounty hunting and after their quarry is gunned down, in a great scene involving a hilariously sleazy Don Johnson as a racist plantation owner, the two team up. But, when Schultz hears of the plight of Django's German speaking slave wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), he agrees to help him search for and free her. This brings them to the door of a vile plantation owner, who specializes in slave fights, named Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). Will Django and Schultz be able to rescue his wife from the devious and well armed Candie? A lot of bullets and blood fly before that question gets answered. Django Unchained isn't perfect. It is definitely a bit too long and the last act could have structured a bit more efficiently but, Tarantino has always been a bit over indulgent and we let him slide because of all the things he gets right and because his films are usually so damn entertaining. And one of the things he gets so right here is the performances out of his cast. Jaime Fox is impressive as Django bringing both a sly humor and a smoldering strength to the slave turned bounty killer. I'm not usually a fan but, he won me over here. Christoph Waltz is an absolute delight as the German bounty hunter with a heart and sense of honor. He gives Tarantino's crisp and witty dialog vivid life and creates an instantly classic character from the pages of the director's script. The same could be said of the phenomenal performance by Leonardo DiCaprio whose wonderfully over the top Calvin Candie practically steals the show. DiCaprio is having a blast playing the vicious and sleazy dandy plantation owner whose charm oozes out of every pore but, only to cover up that this snake has fangs filled with venom and he will strike first chance he gets. And if that triple threat isn't enough, we have a side splitting performance by the great Samuel L. Jackson as Candie's cantankerous head slave Stephen. Stephen may be a slave but, sometimes his manipulation of Calvin makes you seriously wonder who is really running the Candie Land plantation. Tarantino once again gives this top notch cast some wonderful Tarantino dialog to work with and, as usual, shoots Django with his trademark luscious camera work. QT's love of film fills every frame. He skillfully mixes controversial topics such as the horrors of slavery and racism with some very sly and funny humor and peppers it with some blood spattering action and violence. Basically it's a Quentin Tarantino movie. And that's exactly what we paid to see. A fiercely entertaining movie with a great supporting cast featuring the likes of Jonah Hill, Bruce Dern, Don Stroud, Russ and Amber Tamblyn, Dennis Christopher, Michael Parks and James Remar to name a few.",8,1,4,7 January 2013
Evil Dead," Remake of horror classic is a bloody, scary blast!
","The original Evil Dead is one of my all time favorite fright flicks so, I was very apprehensive about a remake. With Sam Raimi, Robert G. Tapert and even Bruce Campbell on board as producers, I hoped the material would at least be treated with respect. Now having seen this new vision of one of the all time horror classics, I can say not only was the material treated with respect but, it is one of the best horror remakes and one hell of a nasty, scary, bloody blast. The best thing is that co-writer and first time director Fede Alvarez smartly takes the basic premise and does his own thing with it. This version has heroine addict, Mia (Suburgatory's Jane Levy) being taken by big brother, David (Skateland's Shiloh Fernandez) and 3 friends to an old family cabin to try to get Mia to quit her habit cold turkey. But, someone has been in the cabin since they were last there and something gruesome has definitely gone on inside with blood stains and dozens of dead animals hanging in the cellar. Of course there is also a mysterious book and within it ominous warnings that it not be read... so, of course, someone does... and at the same time Mia is alone in the woods... uh, oh... I don't need to tell you that soon Mia is possessed by some horrible demonic entity and the gruesome blood soaked nightmare begins as the ancient evil wants to claim them all. Alvarez really crafts a strong, gruesome and scary horror of the likes we haven't seen in a while. It's vicious and nasty with top notch gore and make-up that is done the old fashioned way without any CGI. When limbs fly... and they do, it is good old fashioned prosthetics and I loved the lack of CGI when it came to the ghouls and gore. Alvarez and co-writer Rodo Sayagues (Diablo Cody was supposedly hire to work on the script but, if she was credited, I missed it.) basically give us enough elements of the original to make it recognizable as an Evil Dead flick and thus fits in with the series but, makes the flick it's own animal. And that's the way to do a remake like this. And Alvarez is the real deal who knows how to make a good old fashioned horror movie complete with suspense, tension and intensity, not to mention, plentiful scares. He also gives the film a strong atmosphere and I really liked his visual style. He gets good work from his cast too, especially leading lady Levy whose character has a few stages to go through from heroine addict to a demon possessed creature to... well, you'll have to see to find out. Shiloh Fernandez is also very good, after a lifeless performance in Red Riding Hood he shows us the actor we saw in Skateland was no fluke. The rest, Lou Taylor Pucci as Eric, Jessica Lucas as Olivia and Elizabeth Blackmore as Natalie, do fine making their characters more then demon fodder and they are all likable enough to make us afraid for them when all hell breaks loose. The flick is not perfect but, any flaws are minor and can be overlooked due to all that is done right. Evil Dead 2013 may not be as groundbreaking as the original and only time will tell if it will be highly regard like it's predecessor but, it is a strong, visceral horror that gives equal parts suspense and scares with all the goo and gore. Maybe not quite a classic but, a film worthy of the title Evil Dead. Well done!",8,19,96,4 April 2013
Elysium," Flawed but entertaining new film from District 9's Neil Blomkamp.
","As a huge fan of writer/ director Neil Blomkamp's District 9, I couldn't wait to see what he came up with next. Now after a 4 year wait, his sophomore flick Elysium has arrived. I liked Elysium. I was certainly entertained but, it does have some problems that keep it from reaching the standard set by District 9 such as, a bit of an overloaded story and some surprising overacting by a few principles. Elysium tells the story of the future Earth of 2154. The planet is overpopulated and ravaged and the rich and powerful have moved off planet to the enormous space station of Elysium where they have every convenience and luxury, while the rest are left to labor and wallow in the mess. Enter ex-con Max, (Matt Damon) a man trying to work hard and stay out of trouble and prison, while dreaming of reconnecting with childhood sweetheart, Frey (Alice Braga). An accident at work leaves Max fatally poisoned with radiation and with 5 days left to live, Max needs to get to the only place where he can be cured, Elysium which is off limits to the poor inhabitants of Earth. Max turns to crime-lord and hacker, Spider (Wagner Moura). Spider will get Max on Elysium if he helps steal the information about all it's access codes stored in the brain of one, John Carlyle (William Fichtner) who, unknown to Max and Spider, is working with Elysium Secretary Of Defense, Delacourt (a surprisingly miscast Jodie Foster) to overthrow Elysium's president (Faran Tahir). Still with me? Needless to say Max now has information that Delacourt will kill to get and is being hunted by her henchman, Kruger (Sharlto Copley) all the while trying to find his way to Elysium to heal himself. Throw in strength enhancing exo-skeletons, Frey's sick daughter and we have a Sci-Fi action soup with a lot of ingredients. Elysium does have a bit of an overcomplicated story and while it is not hard to follow, it just has a lot of elements to it as, once again, Blomkamp tackles the theme of 'the haves and the have-nots, as he did in District 9. We get the contrast of the over populated slum Earth has become to the spotless and perfect living conditions the wealthy enjoy in Elysium which, floats above in Earth's orbit as a constant reminder of how little we all are to them and how they are so above us. The message is not subtle but, Blomkamp skillfully keeps it from overwhelming things with so much else going on. There is a lot of fast paced action and with a complex story as we have, the director keeps things moving very quickly. The excess of plot doesn't slow things down though one feels it might have served the film if things were streamlined a little bit and there weren't quite so many players in the game. And as for the players, Damon and Braga are strong though Braga's Frey really doesn't get that much screen time till the last act so we don't identify with her as much even though we do get treated to flashbacks of she and Max as kids in an orphanage. Damon proves once again he can be an action star yet with some nice depth, giving Max some layers that enhances his character much like his surgically attached exo-skeleton enhances his strength and agility. Sadly it's veteran actress Foster who seems to be miscast here. She never quite strays into camp but, plays Delacourt like one half stereotypical bureaucratic douche and the other half Roger Moore era Bond villain complete with unidentifiable accent. It sticks out awkwardly in what is a serious Sci-Fi flick as does District 9 star Sharlto Copley, who is completely over the top as Kruger. Which is disappointing consider how good he was in D9. A calmer demeanor would have made him more threatening. Neither characterization seems to fit in with the more grounded performances of the leads and more serious tone of the film. Joining them is Wagner Moura who is just weak and tries to compensate by over doing it as Spider. An actor with a bit stronger presence who doesn't need to try as hard would have worked better. But, there is still plenty to like about this film. It's story may be complicated but, there is a lot of action to move it along and some delightfully gruesome moments splattered here and there as this future's weapons do make a mess. The last act especially is quite thrilling and has a nice emotional impact to go with all the explosions, gunfire and mechanically enhanced hand to hand combat. The SPFX are flawless, the design is breathtaking and the film could easily take place in District 9′s world. The score by Ryan Amon suits the film well, though reminded me of Dark Knight Rises a bit, but, that's not necessarily a bad thing. So, all in all I liked Elysium and recommend it especially if you enjoyed District 9. It's a bit meatier then most summer fair so, those who are tired of moody superheroes might like being given a bit more to chew on. Just be prepared that there is a complex story to digest along with the action and that a few of the veteran cast members just don't seem right for their roles. Entertaining despite it's flaws and another strong role from the versatile Damon.",7,3,13,9 August 2013
Mama," Supernatural thriller isn't bad but, needs more scares and less CGI.
","Mama isn't a bad horror film but, it just isn't a very scary one. The story is good, two little girls are taken by their off-the-edge dad (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) who's just shot their mother and some co-workers. They crash off the road during dad's escape attempt and wind up in a decrepit old cabin in the woods. One that possibly has an otherworldly occupant. A few years later, they are found alive, somehow having survived and these now feral children are given over to their dad's twin brother Lucas (also Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) and his rocker wife, Annabel (Jessica Chastain). But, the girl's don't seem to have come alone and whatever has followed them isn't happy about sharing them. The problems with Mama aren't from it's story, it's that despite giving the film a nicely spooky visual style, director Andres Muschietti doesn't build much tension, suspense or scares. There are a few creepy sequences and some well executed jump scares but, the biggest problem is that 'Mama' is revealed far too early and it is an obvious CGI specter that is simply not scary. Even when an accident leaves Annabel alone for a while with the girls and their adoptive spook, there is little suspense as Annabel tries to figure out why strange things are happening . It is very well done as Annabel goes from selfish bitch to someone who really cares about the girls and want's to solve the mystery of who 'Mama' is but, it's never scary or carries much tension or suspense. Then, the final act switches gears and we go from a horror film to a Gothic fairy tale ending. I don't think the change in tone quite worked. Ironically I liked the last act very much but, not attached to the rest of the movie. The cast are all good here with Chastain standing out as the bass player wife and reluctant overnight mom. She comes across as a bitch early on but, believably transforms the character into a woman who comes to care about her nieces and is willing to put herself at risk to fight for them. The girls are wonderful too, Megan Charpentier as the older Victoria who starts to see 'Mama' for the dangerous entity she is and Isabelle Nelisse as the younger Lilly who still is very attached to 'Mama' and sees her as a friend and maternal figure. The script is good, it just seems director Muschietti didn't quite know how to give it the edge it needs and the switch in tone for the last act is a bit jarring. Overall Mama is not a bad supernatural thriller and there is a lot to like about it but, it just doesn't quite effectively give the material the strength it needed to keep us riveted or peeking through our fingers which is what a film like this is supposed to do.",6,3,11,18 January 2013
Sinister," Well made but, a strong sense of 'been there, done that.'
","'Sinister' is yet another horror flick that is well made but, is just too familiar to really be effective. The story opens as a true crime author (Ethan Hawke) moves his family into a house where a multiple homicide was committed (always a bad move) that is the subject of his new novel. But, a box of old home movies mysteriously shows up containing footage of numerous murders and before you can say 'The Ring' a pagan boogie man know as Buhguul is haunting the footage and his life. Scott Derrickson does create some nice atmosphere and there are some genuinely spooky scenes and well executed jump scares but, he and C. Robert Cargill's script is far too reminiscent of films like 'The Ring' and 'The Grudge' to establish it's own identity and really scare us. You pretty much know what is coming and it's no shock when the film finally gets there. As usual, Hawke's Ellison makes all the right stupid decisions to set the story in motion and continues to do so to keep it headed toward it's predicable conclusion. And I can forgive stupidity in a horror flick if at least it delivers the goods and 'Sinister' only does really gives us some good chills in the last third but, then arrives at a routine conclusion for this kind of flick that we see coming a mile away. It also doesn't help that so little is known about this Buhguul entity that we never really get a good grasp of it's character and therefor don't really get a good sense of menace. He's just another generic boogie man hiding in pictures and movie footage like the long haired girl ghosts of Asian horror, but, without the personality. The cast all perform well. Hawke is good despite the familiarity of the material and Juliet Rylance does her job as the wife concerned over her husbands behavior, although James Ransone's deputy is one stop away from Deputy Dewey from 'Scream' . The film does have a slow burn and ultimately could have used a few minutes taken out to move things a long better as there is some repetition with some of the scenes' events (the projector starting on it's own). And the film might have been a bit more effective had the spooky scenes come closer together. All in all SInister is worth a rental, it's not bad, just far too much of what we have seen far too many times before to make it anything more then a forgettable diversion.",6,3,5,12 October 2012
Dark Shadows," Uneven movie based on the classic TV show.
","Dark Shadows is yet another Burton/Depp collaboration that is based on the classic 60s-70s TV Gothic soap opera. And you'd think that being based on a whole TV series it would give the writers (John August and Seth Grahame-Smith) plenty of story to utilize, yet, this nearly two hour film has what barely could be considered a plot. Heir to the noble and wealthy Collins family, Barnabas (Johnny Depp) makes the mistake of messing with the wrong servant girl, Angelique (Eva Green) and when scorned, the witch causes the death of his true love (Bella Heathcote) and turns Barnabas into a vampire and has him sealed in a coffin for all eternity. But, Barnabas is set free, accidentally 200 years later in 1972 and finds the Collins Estate in a shambles and his old nemesis Angelique is the cause. Barnabas vows to restore his family empire to it's former glory while battling his powerful former lover. Along the way we do get elements from the show weaved in but, the film can never decide on a tone to it's thin story. One minute it is a fish out of water comedy and the next it's a horror film and next it's a drama. Is it spoofing the original show a la the Brady Bunch Movie, or is it a serious retelling like the brief run revival in 1991? The filmmakers don't seem to know. So what did work? The cast. I loved the cast. Depp is very good at portraying Barnabas and handles the character's script driven changes of tone very well. Michelle Pfeiffer is good, although not given much to do, as the family matriarch, Elizabeth. She plays her role straight and it works. Helena Bonham Carter is Julia Hoffman, the drunk family psychiatrist who tries to cure Barnabas of his curse. She plays her part as more comic relief but, smartly, never goes over the top. And as for over the top, Eva Green has a field day as the villainous witch, Angelique and has a great time with it and it translates to the screen as we have a good time watching her chew the scenery and sex it up. She makes this movie a lot more worth watching. The rest of the cast including, Jackie Earle Haley, Jonny Lee Miller and Chloë Grace Moretz all have a good time with their roles and it's all these cast elements that bring Dark Shadows what fun it has. Burton's direction seems to be a bit laid back at times. As with his script, he doesn't seem to know what degree of seriousness in which to take his film and appears to change his mind depending on the scene. Although, it is when he has things played out with a sense of humor that Dark Shadows is it's liveliest as the more dramatic scenes are ho-hum and the climactic encounter between Barnabas and Angelique seems made up as it goes along. No better example as it is never clear whom is more powerful, Barnabas or the witch as it seems to change back and forth. And not to mention last minute reveals on characters that seem to serve the climactic struggle yet, could have been more fun to develop earlier in the narrative. All in all, Shadows didn't bore but, could have been so much more fun had a tone been decided on and the writers had taken better advantage of the 5 years of available story from the original show. Instead we get a mildly amusing passing of time saved mostly by a top notch cast who seem to know the director and scripters needed a little help.",6,3,5,22 November 2012
Prometheus," Disappointing prequel to the Alien saga.
","Prometheus is not only Ridley Scott's long awaited return to sci-fi but, also to the same universe that his breakout classic Alien took place in. Prometheus is a prequel of sorts detailing events that may have set the story of Alien in motion and created it's iconic creatures. So why at the climax are we so unsatisfied by what we just saw? As with all Scott's films Prometheus is a gorgeously designed and filmed movie but, despite the interesting set up about the possible origins of man and the existence of other superior beings, the visuals are a just an empty candy coating as the film goes nowhere with these ideas. We get a story about Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Repace) who discovers numerous occurrences of a hieroglyphic throughout various earth times and cultures which she interprets as an invitation from a extraterrestrial race. Enter the Weyland Corporation (The villainous 'Company' from the Alien films) who fund an expedition but, apparently with there own agenda. And the Prometheus is off to investigate with it's cliché' corporate villain captain (Charlize Theron, who really doesn't do much but be a company bitch) and the usual suspicious android, David (Michael Fassbender who has the best role). And here lies the problem, we start out expecting to find something fascinating and Damon Lindelof and Jon Spaihts' script gives us a cliché' story of extraterrestrials whose intentions aren't as noble as first believed and slimy corporate villains who want to use what they find for there own nefarious purposes. Sorry, been there, done that. Seen it all before. The beings true purpose in their genetic tampering is never revealed nor does it make sense to leave evidence of their existence on earth when they are ultimately up to no good. Prometheus leaves the most interesting questions unanswered and instead moves the plot along by having characters do the stupidest things... seriously, genius scientists taking their helmets off in an alien environment without any clue that there might be an undetected threat?... Are you kidding me?... I'll admit there are a few tense scenes, although the film is rather laid back pace wise, and could have used a lot more suspense and energy if it wasn't going to get overly interesting with it' story. And most aggravating of all, is that the film is open ended. It doesn't even give us a satisfying conclusion. It leaves the most important questions unanswered and implies we have to wait for yet another film to find out how this story ends and how it links to the beginning of Alien, which it eventually will. A major disappointment from Ridely Scott and company.",5,2,4,8 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Not quite perfect but, an epic conclusion to the Batman trilogy nonetheless!
","Dark Knight Rises is the final film in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy and despite some flaws, it still delivers a spectacular and epic conclusion that should satisfy most fans of this series. The film opens 8 years after the events of The Dark Knight and Batman, having taken the fall for Harvey Dent/Two Face's crimes, has disappeared and The Dent Act has locked up most of Gotham's organized crime. Billionaire Bruce Wayne, still heartbroken over the death of Rachel Dawes, has become a Howard Hughes-like recluse, also not seen in as many years. But, with the arrival of mysterious and beautiful cat burglar, Selina Kyle (a sensational Anne Hathaway) and a vicious terrorist called Bane (a bad ass Tom Hardy), Bruce Wayne decides maybe it's time for The Batman and Bruce Wayne to return to Gotham. Most of my issues with the film are in the first act... the set up. Nolan has a lot to bring us up to speed on, multiple interconnecting stories to start us on and a lot of characters to introduce us to. And it's a bit too much to accomplish in a reasonable amount of time despite the 165 minute length of the film. The first act comes across as choppy and rushed and, to be honest, some of the new characters could have been left out with no harm to the story (Matthew Modine's jerk of a cop for ex.). But, once Batman hits the streets the film settles into it's groove and we get a strong second act, followed by an absolutely spectacular last act that alone delivers more movie for the buck then most anything else recently. While The Avengers was a superhero epic for the kid inside all of us, TDKR was an operatic epic for the adults. Nolan gives the film his trademark intensity which overcomes the film's first act flaws and some of the minor quibbles one might have during the rest of the film, to really deliver a riveting cinematic experience, as he brings his Dark Knight tale to a close. The set pieces are of an epic scale that has rarely been achieved in modern films and Nolan never loses track of the characters within the action. His cast is almost perfect, even with some of the lesser characters. Bale delivers another emotionally charged performance as a man who is not only very human but, larger then life. He successfully creates a man who has two distinct identities yet, is very much the same man. Ann Hathaway is simply a great Selina Kyle. She gives a complex portrayal of a woman who is desirable, dangerous, cunning and yet, not without her humanity. She is a survivor and an opportunist and outright lethal, if she needs to be, but, there are also hints of vulnerability and a heart. Her and Bale have a great chemistry together as both their outer characters and their alter egos. Tom Hardy is cast as the terrorist Bane. A monster of a man but, with an intellect that is only matched by his ferocity and viciousness. Hardy hits a home run with this villain, who may not be quite The Joker but, makes his own impact and is totally believable as a man who could possible outsmart and outfight The Dark Knight. He makes Batman the underdog and that adds to the film's drama and intensity. Marion Cotillard was the weak link here. Her character is given little to do through most of the film and when she does become important to the proceedings, she just doesn't have the dramatic strength or intensity to make it work. She's not bad but, just doesn't give the role the strength it needs in the short amount of time the character is given to make an impact. In contrast Joseph Gordon-Levitt once again shows he's an actor to watch as a beat cop who has never lost sight of the true hero that Batman is, despite taking the blame for Dent's murders, and maybe has some of that hero in himself when everyone else around him gives up hope. To wrap up the casting call, Caine, Oldman and Freeman are brilliant as always. Caine in particular has a few scenes that prove he is, without a doubt, one of the greatest actors of all time, plain and simple. On a technical level, TDKR is beautifully filmed with Nolan's camera achieving a rarely seen grandeur and the SPFX are flawless. The action scenes are intense, especially the fights between Bane and Bats and any further questions or flaws I have with the film are drowned in the operatic spectacle that Nolan has delivered. Sure the first act could have been smoother in flow and there are some plot holes and I don't agree with absolutely everything Nolan and company chose to do in finishing their epic trilogy but, when the smoke clears, it is both entertaining and satisfying on a grand scale and if Nolan did get a bit bombastic in his final chapter, the indulgence can be easily forgiven when considering the overall achievement in delivering not only one of the greatest film trilogies but, giving one of the greatest comic book characters ever, the film series he needs... and the one he deserves.",8,1,4,21 July 2012
Thor: The Dark World," Edgier but, still enormously entertaining sequel.
","Thor was one of my favorite of the Marvel Phase 1 movies. I loved it's fun mix of fantasy and real world adventure and thought Hemsworth made a noble and very likable hero. And now the Norse God turned superhero is back in his second solo adventure and a welcome return it is. Thor: The Dark World opens 5000 years earlier with an alignment of the planets being taken advantage of by the Dark Elves and their leader Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) to unleash a weapon called The Aether which will convert all the worlds into dark matter where only the Dark Elves may exist. Thor's grandfather Bor (Tony Curran) defeats the invaders and they are assumed destroyed and The Aether is hidden away never to be found... or so Bor hoped. But, in the present, the worlds are aligning again and the long dormant Malekith and the remaining Dark Elves seek to destroy all once more and, as fate would have it, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) stumbles upon the hidden weapon and it is absorbed within her. Now hunted by Malekith, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) brings Jane to Asgard against Odin's (Anthony Hopkins) wishes and must somehow find a way to stop Malekith, banish The Aether and save the woman he loves and all the known worlds... and the only one who can help him is his devious step brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) imprisoned in Asgard's dungeons by Thor's own hand. This second solo adventure is this time directed by Game Of Thrones and Deadwood director Alan Taylor who creates a much grittier and down to Earth version of Asgard then the bright and magic kingdom-ish version we saw in the delightful first feature directed by Kenneth Branagh. It's still recognizable as Asgard and it blends perfectly with the first Thor but, we get to see far deeper into the city and into it's halls and pubs and get a more lived in and functional look at Thor's homeland. The tone of the film is also darker at times and that was a nice change from the upbeat first film and Avengers but, so not to get too dark or grim, the film is punctuated with a lot of fun and humorous sequences especially those involving Darcy (Kat Dennings) and Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard), the latter's trip to Stonehenge being especially hilarious. I thought the humor and the darker story elements were blended just fine and there was plenty of action and strong drama throughout till the big free-for-all ending set in London where Thor and Malekith finally get to throw down. And the action and special effects do not disappoint, they are top notch as all the previous Marvel films. The budget is on screen in all aspects from sets to costumes to FX. Taylor gets good work from all the cast. There are some nice character moments in between the drama and destruction and all the actors are now very comfortable in their roles and work very well together. Hemsworth is once again a noble hero who has grow since his first visit and the battle in New York. He and Portman still have a nice chemistry together and I liked their scenes especially when Thor has to explain where he's been for two years. Dennings gets a bit more screen time and handles it well getting some of the bigger laughs and Hiddleston is once again scene stealing as Loki. It was also nice to see Rene Russo get a big scene and have a bit bigger part this time and Hopkins is still endearing as the weary but, majestic Odin. We also get some nice scenes with supporting characters Heimdall (Idris Elba), Sith (Jaimie Alexander), Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Fandral (now Zachary Levi) and Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) but, those expecting expanded roles from this bunch will be disappointed. Newcomer to Thor's world Christopher Ecceleston, is OK as villain Malekith but, he really doesn't make a strong impression or stay with you after the film is over. To me his somewhat tepid villain is the film's only real stand out weak point. Taylor's interpretation of Don Payne and Robert Rodat's script is highlighted by a moody score by Brian May and some nice cinematography by Kramer Morgenthau. Overall, Thor: The Dark World is a very entertaining follow-up that gives us enough of the action, drama and suspense we are looking for and takes it in enough of a different direction to keep it fresh but, not straying too far to alienate us. It's not perfect, as stated the villain could have been stronger, there are a few slows spots here and there especially in the first half and earlier on we can tell there was a bit of editing to manage the running time but, for all the entertainment we get, those minor flaws can be overlooked. A fun and worthy sequel to both Thor and The Avengers and certainly less schizophrenic then the mixed bag that was Iron Man 3. As with all Marvel films stay through the entire credits for not one but, two additional sequences and keep an eye out for a couple of really fun cameos. Another solid bit of entertainment from Marvel and Disney.",8,0,4,7 November 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Bleak, dull and disappointing sequel.
","I have to start out by saying that I have never read the Hunger Games books and therefor am taking the movies for what they are. That being said, I enjoyed the first film, it was no classic but, it was entertaining and Jennifer Lawrence gave a strong performance as usual. But, sadly the second film based on this trilogy of popular books is a moody and bleak disappointment. Catching Fire picks up with Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) about to embark on their victory tour to be paraded like show ponies through the districts. But, Katniss' act of defiance that provoked the unprecedented two winners in the 74th Hunger Games has sown the seeds of dissent throughout the 12 districts and is seen by The Capitol as a symbol of rebellion. President Snow (Donald Sutherland) himself visits Katniss to warn her to play nice on the tour or her family and friends will suffer the consequences. Meanwhile Katniss is suffering from the horrible guilt of having to kill and watch others she bonded with die and no matter where she goes, she finds herself being looked up to as a symbol of hope against the totalitarian government and her own contempt for The Capitol grows each day. Snow's new game-maker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) proposes a solution to their woes... to make the 75th Hunger Game a battle between selected former winners of the games from each district and to make sure Miss Everdeen is not amongst the winners this time. Now, as the wind of rebellion is starting across the districts, Katniss and Peeta must fight once more and this time against proved killers. Will the shell shocked Katniss survive once again or will the country's hope for freedom be crushed with the death of their symbol of defiance. Catching Fire is this time directed by Francis Lawrence who gave us the moody and bleak fantasy flicks Constantine and I Am Legend and brings that same dark and grim atmosphere to this middle chapter of the book based trilogy and to be honest little else. Fire is a rather dull and by the numbers sequel with a very sedate and bleak look to go along with it's oppressive atmosphere. I realize this is a story of a land governed by a cruel and iron fisted government who are planning to basically execute the peoples' first glimmer of hope so, I didn't expect rainbows and unicorns but, when a movie like this' best scene involves a dress, then you know there's not much going for it. Even with Katniss being inserted into another combat, the 75th Hunger Game provides very little action and literally no suspense as it focuses on Katniss and group of allies commiserating in the jungle arena with very little threat save some poison gas and some foul tempered primates. Their actual foes rarely put in an appearance, save when their pictures are displayed above in the sky to signal their demise... most of which prompted this reviewer to ask 'who the hell was that?' And that's also a problem, we only get to know the participants that are crucial to the plot and the rest are just fodder to try to give the game some urgency and body count... and it doesn't really work because, we never really care about these people and some we have never even met. To be honest save for a few moments, such as the before mentioned dress scene, I was pretty bored with what was going on. Katniss never seems to be in control like in the first film and spends most of the film pouting or having combat flashbacks and we never get endeared to or behind her like in the first flick. Here she seems to stew in her unhappiness and let others around her do all the work till literally the last few moments of the film. And it's not until the very last scene do we finally see the fire back in the eyes of the girl on fire... then we are left with an open ending leading into the third flick. Sorry, but for someone who hasn't read the books, this was completely unsatisfying. The cast all perform their roles just fine with Harrelson once again standing out and giving a strong turn as Abernathy... he has become one of the best actors out there... Sutherland is appropriately slimy and singer Lenny Kravitz also impresses as Cinna. As for leading lady Lawrence, she is good and gives the part a lot of emotional depth but, since most of those emotions require her to pout, cry or have a screaming out-burst, it's just hard to warm up to Katniss this time. And as for her co-star, like in the first flick , Hutcherson recites his lines with does eyes making his every scene appear like he's posing for a velvet painting. And does Katniss really love him or the hunky Gale (Liam Hemsworth, Thor's brother) because, I am confused at this point and not sure I care. So, in conclusion, this second Hunger Games failed to get my interest or emotional involvement in the story because, it was just too dark and bleak and gave us a lead character who, instead of being a symbol of hope, looked like she was ready to climb under a blanket on the couch and pout with a gallon of ice cream and a bottle of scotch. And after watching this moody second installment you might want to too! At least the sets and FX were top notch and Harrelson and a few others elevated their performances above the dark cloud that hovers over this flick. Very disappointing.",5,64,133,22 November 2013
50_50," A young twenty-something deals with getting cancer.
","As someone who had a minor bout with cancer myself, I can identify with some of the story presented here and was really surprised how well this film, about a twenty-something man who finds himself with a rare and potentially fatal type of cancer, presented much of it. My case was nowhere near as severe as Gordon-Levitt's Adam but, I can say the film really nailed the inner turmoil, the mixed thoughts and emotions, the unexpected humor that seems to come out of nowhere and the strange way people approach and talk to you when they find out. Not only is the script insightful but, really balances the heavy drama with the lighter and more touching moments perfectly. The film is never overly melodramatic or sappy, nor is it condescending with it's humor and it also never manipulates the audience but, let's the audience experience the emotions from the story itself. Obviously Director Jonathan Levine had a big part in making this sensitive story work so well but, he is also helped by getting really great performances out of a really great cast. Levitt is near perfect as a man suddenly faced with his mortality at a point in his life where he still has so much he wants to accomplish. Seth Rogen perfectly portrays that one friend who is always there to brighten spirits by adding just the right levity at just the right moments. The friend who loves you enough to make you feel stupid for feeling sorry for yourself and to take it when your inner anger makes you short tempered. Rounding out the cast is legendary Anjelica Huston as his mother, Bryce Dallas Howard as his undeserving girlfriend and Anna Kendrick as his therapist/ love interest. This is one of the best dramas I have seen in a long while and it adds enough humor to keep one from being overwhelmed and to remind us that, like life, there is almost always something to make us smile in even the worst situations. Bravo.",9,0,0,26 January 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," A bloody fun twist on the isolated cabin sub-genre
","If anyone knows how to have fun with pop culture horror conventions, it's Joss Whedon (Buffy The Vampire Slayer, The Avengers) and he and Director Drew Goddard craft a funhouse of a horror movie by doing just that. And we are happily along for the bloody fun ride. Cabin is a movie where the less you know going in, the better. So, I'll simply say that it starts out with the classic young partiers heading up to an isolated cabin scenario and then turns this horror sub-genre into something quite different and deviously fun. Aside from a really clever script and the fact that Drew Goddard knows how to craft suspense and scares, despite letting us in early on what is going on, we also get a bunch of likable characters (including Thor himself, Chris Hemsworth) to root and care for. This is very important to make a horror flick work and so many films today makes their leads unlikable jerks who we could care less about. We are only scared when we care what happens to the antagonists and here we do. We like this bunch of characters and it adds to the film's effect that we don't want to see them suffer the fate that has befallen them. And what a clever and cruel fate Whedon and Goddard have in store for their victims. And, in turn, providing a clever and inventive blood soaked horror for us. The FX are top notch and the performances from his cast, especially leading heroine Kristen Connolly, are good and help make the scenario work. The script provides plenty of scares and gore but, also gives us some tension-relieving laughs with Whedon's trademark sly humor. Everything is blended together well by director Goddard, who gets us primed and ready for the 'all hell breaks loose' final act. A real horror movie blast!",8,116,228,13 April 2012
