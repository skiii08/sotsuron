Skyfall," worst film ever!!
",Hands down the biggest wreck of a Bond film ever!!. made Quantum of Solace look like an Oscar winning film. nearly 2h30m long and at least 30m of it is people walking into a room looking at something and saying or doing nothing. I am a Bond film fan I have every film in my collection but when this is released on disc I WILL be skipping over it.In the cinema all I could think about was going outside in the -4 weather for a cigarette. My advise is stay at the bar for another few drinks and then go and watch the last 45mins you won't miss much.,2,20,41,4 November 2012
