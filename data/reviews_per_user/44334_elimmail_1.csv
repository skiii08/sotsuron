The Ring," Battle of the Rings
","I've seen both versions of The Ring, the American before the original, and I prefer the American version better.  Although the Japanese version has the definate trump card of preceding the American, it's too mucked up in Japanese mysticism to really have universal appeal.  The American movie is not without its flaws, the horse branch never really plays out, and the ostensible holes, yet the tone and feel is overall more creepy.  It may go for the 'jump' scares rather than an overall feel of unease, but these jump scares linger with you for a while.  There are some truly ridiculous parts in both movies, but the Japanese scene where they decide to empty the well takes the cake.  See both because it's ultimately just personal preference that wins in this battle.",Null,1,1,18 August 2003
