The Blair Witch Project," fear?!
","I think in the way The Blair Witch Project was made, alone, adds character to the film (first person). The most scary movie I have ever seen has been The Exorcist, but I would have to say The Blair Witch Project conjured up the most fear. There is an indescribable fear that you get when you watch the last five minutes of this film. I guess I could say that this movie is fear - not a fear one experiences from having a monster pop out from behind a tree, but the type of fear one could only have from feeling hopelessly afraid. Five stars in my book!",10,1,2,20 August 1999
