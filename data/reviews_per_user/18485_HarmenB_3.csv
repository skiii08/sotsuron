Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," New epic trilogy? Where?
","First I have to admit I'm not very familiar with the Star Wars universe. I still have to see the trilogy once again, to fully understand the story and get to know the characters better. But I like what I saw, and that was a nice, slow-paced and epic trilogy, with a lot of attention for the story and characters. It was even so slow-paced that my father managed to fall asleep in the cinema in those days. But that easy way of telling a good story is the reason that people nowadays still love or are beginning to love the old Trilogy...What a difference with The Phantom Menace. The only things that kept me interested in TPM were the truly magnificent computer graphics. They are detailed and often funny, except for Jar-Jar, who makes me wish my remote control had a built-in digital eraser. But the really bad thing is that the acting of the humans is horrible too. For weeks after seeing the movie I couldn't stand Liam Neeson when I saw him on TV. He acts like he has constipation or something and is saying his lines with no expression at all; just watch the scene where he and his friends are chased in their craft. Jake Lloyd (Anakin) has obviously not much acting talent (yet). Why didn't the makers contract Haley Joel Osment (from the Sixth Sense) or another natural talent for an expensive movie like this? He's the main character, for heaven's sake.I'm afraid I'm still not done, although I did my best to like this movie. I think it's really, really too bad that this new trilogy has kicked off like this. There aren't that many 'hard core' sci-fi movies made nowadays, let alone trilogies, so as a sci-fi fanatic I thought that this trilogy guaranteed me a good time in the cinema. Of course, you can always find a reason to like a film, such as beautiful graphics, but an exciting story and brilliant acting would add so much more. I mean, when I want to see nice computer graphics, I'll just start a video game. Now, after seeing TPM, I really don't give a thing about what's going to happen next. I'm still going to watch the next movie, but I can't image that the acting and the story are going to be better all of a sudden.What keeps me wondering is why the makers succeeded in messing up a film and likely a whole trilogy, when there are millions of (of course critical) fans waiting to see it! And what about all those good examples in film history? Forget epic dimensions, even Disney is jealous of the childish level of this film. It's a bad thing when you leave the cinema thinking: 'I certainly knew what to do with those facilities and such a budget at my disposal...!'",6,0,1,28 April 2001
Army of Darkness," Not really funny, baby
","I'm afraid this movie is only truly enjoyable for Bruce Campbell/Sam Raimi worshippers. It doesn't even get close to Evil Dead II, Raimi's previous movie with Campbell, when it comes to hilarious fun. Of course I had to laugh, but only for 3 or 4 times (just like the 3 guys I was watching it with), and mostly because I couldn't believe we rented such an unfunny B-movie. Besides that it's certainly not creepy or even exciting, due to the incoherent directing by Raimi. A movie with a crazy plot like this has so many oppurtunities for good jokes and 'shocking' moments, and it's really a shame that only a few are being used by the director. Go watch Evil Dead II or Braindead/Dead Alive by Peter Jackson instead if you want to see some serious over-the-top gore and fun.But I have to say that there's one good thing about this movie, it somehow brought back that nice 'elementary-school-birthday-party-creepy-but-funny-movie'-feeling...Rating: 5/10",5,3,7,3 February 2002
Donnie Darko," A movie like a dream
","I saw Donnie Darko yesterday at the '18e Festival van de Fantastische Film' in Amsterdam and I am glad I did! Movies like this one are too rare in this world, although it fits in the 'mind screw' movie trend of the last few years. (see Memento, Usual Suspects, Sixth Sense, The Others)Not everything immediately makes sense after viewing, and maybe it never will, but that doesn't matter at all. The movie is like a dream. Scenes seem to melt into one another and there's this constant feeling of hidden meaning and symbolism. The sound effects, the music, clever use of slow-mo and minimal but good digital effects draw you into the twisted world of Donnie, played perfectly by Jake Gyllenhaal. The movie is a lot funnier than you might expect, there were a lot of giggling viewers and at least 4 laughing-out-loud moments! In the movie, every character has its place and is developed well. Donnie's family, his friends, his teachers... they all form his weird but believable universe. I predict that Jena Malone (Donnie's girlfriend Gretchen) and Jake Gyllenhaal himself will have a glorious future in the world of film. This movie is a mix of the dreamy teenage melancholy of 'The Virgin Suicides', the psychological terror of 'Jacob's Ladder', the criticism on American society of 'American Beauty' and the complex plot structure of 'Memento'. And then to realize this is a DEBUT of writer/director Richard Kelly! I can't wait for future projects of this guy.The applause at the end of the film wasn't precisely impressive, but what do you expect with an ending like that...10/10",9,0,0,13 April 2002
