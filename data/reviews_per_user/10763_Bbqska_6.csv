Casablanca," I wanna go to Rick's Cafe
","If it weren't for the Nazis, Rick's cafe would be a great place to go, even today for food, drinks, and music am I right? I wonder why nobody's opened one in real life? Maybe they have, I will have to look that up. Anyway, the movie was great, cheesy in some parts (where they should be I guess), but great. It had big presence actors, evil to fight, a good looking woman, great atmosphere/sets, and unlikely twists. Shadows and lighting were masterfully done, especially with hat shadows across the face, and the sparkling of jewelry and eyes. I was also a big fan of the police chief who added a down to earth humor to the situation. Ooh, and I also learned why 'bogarting' something meant being selfish.",8,1,3,11 May 2011
Taxi Driver," dark
","Other than Goodfellas, Casino, and The Godfather, Robert DeNiro was in a slew of mediocre acting roles like Analyze This and the Focker movies except for Taxi Driver which he did brilliantly. This was a well shot, dark, gritty, and depressing look at late night city life and how people can be seedy, disgusting, and it's down-right depressing. DeNiro does a great job of having the best intentions and then, pretty much, becoming that he despises and wants to get rid of. I believe that, without DeNiro, this would still have been a well-done artistic movie, but DeNiro does a good job of making this more than that by getting you to come down to his view and root for him, even though he's kind of crazy. It's a classic and rightfully so. So if you haven't seen it, you should.",8,0,1,13 May 2011
The Exorcist," still haunting...
","I had a 'fright night' a few months back where me and my girlfriend would watch a bunch of scary movies. So neither of us had seen The Exorcist and watched it. Wow, very raw and gritty, even for today so I can't imagine how they took it back in the 70s. When she started masterbating with the cross, I think I said 'holy crap' out loud. The special effects were good. It seemed a bit slow at times and I really didn't quite grasp the opening desert scene, but fairly solid movie. Not a fan of tragic or unexplained endings, and this one had both, but still a good movie and would recommend it to anyone else having a fright night of their own.",8,2,3,11 May 2011
Annie Hall," meh...
","I honestly don't have much of an opinion about this movie. I didn't hate it or love it. It was very middle of the road for me. There were a good number of laughs, but sometimes I felt Allen would ramble. I don't know what it is, but Allen, to me, wasn't the most likable character. He was very whiney, and whenever he would say something nice or heartwarming, it didn't come across as genuine. I guess the point of the movie is that relationships have their ups and downs and that they work themselves out in the long run one way or another. Hmmm... what else? Young Keaton was a breath of fresh air compared to some of her later roles.",7,0,1,11 May 2011
The Graduate," I've finally seen it
","I liked the beginning of the movie the best. I really could empathize for Benjamin in his position and even making some of his decisions. However, his boyish charm and comic discomfort, in my opinion go flying out the window about halfway through the movie. He gets kind of creepy, and one of the reasons I think that may be is that they didn't develop Ben's relationship with the daughter enough. It looked like they went on one date (that started with a strip club visit), all of a sudden they're in love, then they break up, but he follows her, gets an apartment and stalks her. Come on... kind of creepy right? His landlord could sense it too. Oh, and I like Paul Simon as much as the next guy, but that was overkill.",7,0,1,11 May 2011
Singin' in the Rain," breath of fresh air
","So I was dreading having to watch a musical, especially an old one, but wow. It was really really good. The dancing was actually quite talented, funny, and at times plain awesome. I was a big fan of Cosmo (and the way he did a backflip off the wall), he really picked the movie back up at certain parts. They all had good singing voices and worked really well together. It was surprisingly funny too and found myself laughing out loud at parts. Good tap-dancing is so hard not to appreciate, because it's just so entertaining when done well. I highly recommend anyone with phobias of musicals to give this one a chance, you can even take your girlfriend and get brownie points!",8,1,2,11 May 2011
