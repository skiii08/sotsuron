The New World," It was a new way of making movies!!!
",The New World was not your average movie. The filming was amazing it gave you a sense of freedom. The acting seemed as if you were really watching these two lovers for real. Oh and the music was beyond belief.This Movie is about the growth of Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher). When you first meet her she has no cares. Then she falls in love with Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell). Then is taken away from Smith for a while sending her into depression. By the end of the movie she resolves all her problems and becomes a peaceful person.The filming breaks all filming laws and takes the most extreme and strange shots that you might hate or might love. If you hate it look past that and follow the story.,7,0,2,10 June 2006
