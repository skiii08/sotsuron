Casablanca," Prophecy and Bogie and two stories
","The film rates a 10 for three reasons.Prophecy,  Bogart and two stories.My favorite sence is where everyone sings the French National Aanthem in the cafe.  Keep in mind this was 1942 and the Nazi menace had swallowed Europe. What took place on the screen would take place in realty three years later.  Anyone not moved by this sence has no sense of history.Borgats,  character is as interesting as that sence is inpirational. He starts as the bitter man yet we see these signs of altrusim.  He rigs the Casino so he can loose money rather than see the Calous police cheif virtualy rape a young girl. The Altruism wins just as the french singers win in the cafe.The Romance and the espionage come together. Bogart makes the choice. He says 'I'm not much on being noble....'  Yet he perfoms  one of the most noble acts on film.  He places his personal life seccond to the cause.",10,1,1,17 July 2001

It's a Wonderful Life," lives its story
","This film lived its story.  If a film did have a soul this film would certainly have fealt the way George did on that dismal Christmas Eve in 1945.  It was at best a moderate box office success but it would suffer obscruity for many a year.  Indeed it was so obscure that the holders of the Copyright never sought renewal.  One could buy it on 8 Millimetter film for peaunuts.The film woud gradually develop a cult folowing and would be seen on countless occasions during Christmas week.  Two of the fims most important forces, Director Capra and Leading man Jimmy Stewart would make frquent talks show appearances and each would name it as their favorite film.Capra would be so linked with the film that his Baltimore SunObituary would read 'Its a Wonderful Life Director has Joined the Angels'The film  would like the hero would come to be recgonized for its outstanding contribution . For just as George Bailey provided Bedford Falls citizens  with  'a few rooms and a bath'  Mr Capra warms our souls every Christmas and will do so as long as the world has souls that seek warmth.",9,1,5,17 July 2001
The Godfather," like watchin willlie's catch
","Baseball and Film are among my passions.   The soul craves seeing something done well.   Even people who know nothing about baseball can look at Willie Mays catch in  the 53  (not sure of the year) World Series and see that it is executed with perfection.Every sence in this Movie has a kind of Mauysian Catch quality. In the first sence,  we  see a man sitting at a dek with a most grandfatherly deamonor petting a pussy cat.  I first thought this was a deliberate attempt to make a statement he is so gentle yet a cold blooderd mobster.  Legend has it however, that the cat came onto the set by accident and Brando  (with the reflex of a Willie Mays) knew just what to do.
When Tom is kidnapped  he is told 'If I wanted to kill you'd be dead alreardy'   we are reminded that murder is a natural as breathing.From the time the undertaker begs for justice until the time Kay sees Micheal for a ruthless killer  we see acting as good as the Sey Hey Kid could catch.  To maintain this quality for a few sences is an achievement.  To maintain it in every sence for well over two hours is an offer no one should refuse.",10,0,1,12 July 2001
