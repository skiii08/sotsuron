Scarface," Arguably Al Pacino's best performance....
","Scarface was seen as nothing but a violent, offensive, garbage movie to critics when it was originally released.  It's still probably seen that way today.  But I would imagine, to their disappointment, it has and continues to stand the test of time.  Scarface will never be on a Top 100 list, but it is one of the best movies ever made in my opinion.  The realism of Scarface, I could only guess, scared a lot of people away.  This realism, along with its no holds barred, uncensored nature, makes this film great in my eyes. Now, many people use this to write off Scarface as an irresponsible, misguided movie with a tasteless overabundance of blood, drugs, killing and cursing.  Those who can appreciate the grittiness of Scarface are who talk highly of it.  This is quite a departure for Brian DePalma as far as subject matter, but he handled it masterfully.  Al Pacino's performance of Tony Montana is rivaled by only a few in the history of film...he's so good in the role it's scary. The fact that so many celebrated actors like John Travolta & Kevin Spacey all do good impersonations of Tony Montana is a testament to the influence of Pacino's performance.  Pacino is so good that at times I can't believe that its actually him on screen.  Appreciate this movie for the influence it has on film.  It's not on the level of other classic gangster films like The Godfather & Goodfellas; but it's still one of the best of the genre. Probably Al Pacino's best performance.*** 1/2 out of **** stars.",9,0,1,1 December 2003
Catch Me If You Can," Suprisingly enjoyable
","**POSSIBLE SPOILERS INCLUDED**I was skeptical about this film, because I know how sappy Spielberg could be, and I am in no way a fan of DiCaprio.  Although, after seeing this film, I'd have to admit that I enjoyed it.  The appeal with this film, above all else in my opinion, is the facination you're forced to have with Dicaprio's character....just HOW did he get away with all of that!?!?!  It didn't seem to me that Spielberg involved himself too much in this film, and I must admit that DiCaprio shines in his lead role.  It seems that he is finally starting to come into his own as a decent actor.  Christopher Walken (a favorite of mine) was great as always.  Tom Hanks, suprisingly, was tolerable as well...it was refreshing to see him in a role where you're not forced to see him as an immortal, or always feel sorry for him.  He played his role straight-up and I enjoyed him.  The story was told very well, although I thought the film was a bit too long.  One thing I didn't quite get though...whatever happened to the gameshow sequence in the beginning of the film?  That was never explained.  Anyway, this film is not a classic by any means, but was suprisingly good and I would recommend it to true fans of 'cinema'.  3 out of 4 stars.",7,0,1,8 August 2003
Iron Man 3," What an embarrassment, a complete slap in the face!!
","I watch the trailer for Iron Man 3 months ago, I love it. I go to a friend of mine who's deep into comics. I ask him, 'what's the deal with Mandarin?'. His reply? 'Mandarin is to Iron Man as Joker is to Batman'. WHOA! Hearing that after watching the trailer I was more than hyped to see this film; if for no other reason than enjoying Avengers and hoping they rebound from the horror that was Iron Man 2. Dare I say the third entry in this series is worse than the second one! The essence of superhero stories/movies is the villain. We don't get one here. From what I've heard, Mandarin is as big as they come in the Iron Man universe, the character was right there for the movie makers to translate to the big screen. But what does Shane Black & Co. do? They make an absolute joke out of Mandarin! He's there, but then he's....NOT there. That's the big twist?? The 'villain' in this film turns out to be someone who Tony Stark blows off one New Years Eve years ago who essentially comes back years later with unexplained powers and using a 'boogeyman' as a decoy. The 'boogeyman' aspect might be the only positive of the film, as it holds a mirror to the ways and actions of the US in the last decade or so.There's just so many gripes I have with this film, but it's honestly not worth the extra time it'll take to type here, as I'm sure there's enough reviews on here describing just what is so wrong with this film. The sheer FAILURE of this film may just be a sign that it's time to slow down on the whole comic book craze in Hollywood. If they are just going to disregard the source material while at the same time taking a big sh!t on the wishes of comic book fans (and I'm not even one, per se), it would be best to just stay away from the comic book world altogether.Again, I write this review as a movie fan. Iron Man 3 is just a bad movie. There is NOTHING out of the ordinary in this movie. Corny one-liners, idiotic plot holes and twists just pushes this mess of a movie to the depths of hell. I can't believe this script got OK'd by Marvel, Stan Lee & Co. How did they let this pass? If they were able to do Thor and the universe(s) featured in that story, why the hell couldn't they do that here with Mandarin and the 10 rings?!?! If you're going to put Mandarin in the film, PUT HIM IN THE FILM! I'm just appalled at the approach taken here. As loyal as comic fans are, it's understandable that you can't satisfy them all. It is when you show a complete disregard and disrespect for the source material that makes movies like this even more disturbing.I can only offer condolences to all the fans (comic book fans in particular) that came to this expecting at least SOMETHING along the lines of what Nolan did with The Dark Knight. One cannot blame ANYONE for those expectations. Watching the trailer (which ends up being one of the biggest okie-dokes EVER put on movie fans), this film had the look of an epic with a darker tone, a la Nolan's Batman series. What we get is an inexcusable embarrassment; with the total castration of the hero's archenemy and the same old, same old with regards to effects, story, etc. Iron Man 3 is one of the worst films of the year.... actually, it's one of the worst movies ever made.",1,6,14,11 May 2013
The Ring," Got what I expected....not a very good film...
","**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**Well one thing I did expect from this film, was for it to be scary.  This film is NOT AT ALL SCARY!  I didn't expect much from The Ring, and I didn't get much.  I still want to know how the boy is psychic...??? The lead actress was not very good, neither was her boyfriend.  I expect the boy to be around, he was convincing, although no one knows how/why he's psychic.  One thing I really liked was the video.  Whoever put that together has to be really sick in the head, that was VERY engaging, although it raises so many more questions.  For example, the girl was left up in the barn with a TV.  How does her spirit connect to a video cassette?  Who made it?  For what it tried to be, The Ring is tolerable, I didn't HATE the movie afterwards.  There are just too many plot holes for it to be taken really seriously.  I'm interested in watching the original Japanese version though. ** stars out of **** .",7,0,1,8 August 2003
Minority Report," Very original and entertaining....
","Possible spoilers:
I basically went into this movie curious as to how they were going to explain how they could arrest and punish someone before they commit a crime. Although I would've like the logic to be explained further, this film has to be the most original I have seen in a pretty good while.  I'll admit, I tend to cringe at Spielberg's films, as they can be WAY too sappy and cheezy at times.  But 'Minority Report' is as gritty as you can get.  This has to be one of the most gratifying and refreshing movies I've seen in a theater (along with 'Insomnia') in a good while.  Tom Cruise acted well, and the story was very gripping and entertaining all the way through.  I think the film could've been about 10-15 minutes shorter, but great nevertheless.  I doubt you'd see a more original film for a while.",9,0,1,24 June 2002
Friday Night Lights," Okay football flick...seen it all before.
","**WARNING! SPOILERS BELOW!!!**I guess if 'Friday Night Lights' came out a few years ago, I could appreciate it more. When I saw the trailer months ago I just shrugged it off as yet ANOTHER football movie. It's all been done before, how many football movies do we need? In the past 5 years we've had Remember The Titans, Any Given Sunday and Varsity Blues....go back further and there was The Program...and even a football comedy flick (Unnecessary Roughness). Same premise here: small town obsessed with their football, overprotective parents living through their high school athlete sons, hoping they get the glory of 'winning state'. It comes off as all the same to me. Billy Bob did what he had to do here...and Derek Luke just can't seem to rise above the 'supporting actor' status. This is the second movie where I've seen his character basically incapacitated within the first hour of a movie where he's one of the main stars of the film (the other being 'Spartan', where his character was the victim of one of the most unexpected and shocking deaths ever in film). Outside of Antoine Fisher, one really has to wonder if he'll ever get the leading role in a worthwhile film again.What I found funny was the fact that I sat in the theater for 2 hours with this team; watching them go through their respective battles/dramas in their lives......just for them to lose in the state championship game in the final seconds by inches (I must admit that was pretty tough to witness), and then to get a subtitle saying that Billy Bob coached them again next year and won the state title going undefeated. I guess that 'winning' season was too boring of a story, huh? But I get it, they still 'won' here...off the field in their own respective lives, in essence 'becoming perfect' in the words of Billy Bob. Eh. 'Friday Night Lights' is an okay flick, nothing special; but don't expect anything new here...I honestly don't know how anyone can.** out of **** stars.",6,2,3,9 October 2004
Fight Club," Look through the 'violence' and you'll find a true gem....
","This film could very easily be frowned upon if one doesn't really look at what's being presented.  From the blunt title to the underlying theme of fist-fight clubs, on face value 'Fight Club' would be seen as just a macho man-movie with nothing behind it.  The actual violence isn't really that much if you think about it....only one person actually dies in the movie. As someone pointed out in the DVD booklet, you see more violence in the first 10 minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan' than you see in all 139 minutes of Fight Club.  The highlight of the film is the great acting and even better dialogue. This is one of those films that can stand on its piercing dialogue alone, you don't feel that its 2 hours and 20 minutes.  This is Edward Norton's finest performance along with Primal Fear and probably American History X. This is also one of Brad Pitt's best moments, he played the alter ego perfectly.  David Fincher has a knack for the disjointed, dark feel, and he uses it to perfection here.Fight Club is a much deeper film than one would think, seeing how it was marketed and advertised.  As far as it being on the Top 250 list, that's probably attributed more to male teens just infatuated with the macho male pride fist-fighting and blood rather than the message buried inside.  Still, 'Fight Club' is one of the best films to come out in the past few years.***1/2 out of **** stars.",8,1,3,30 August 2004
Underworld," Surprisingly good! I'm impressed!
","As soon as I saw the preview to this film I wrote it off as a silly Matrix rip-off trying to attack a subject that is so tired (vampires/werewolves). I really never had any intention of seeing Underworld until my girlfriend, who saw it in theaters, repeatedly suggested I watch it.  After watching the DVD just now I must say that I enjoyed it a lot.  I was completely into the story, which is surprisingly rich and engaging.  One would have to be a bit naïve not to admit that Underworld does indeed borrow from a variety of action films, most notably The Matrix.  It should be obvious to any free-thinking person that none of the ideas present in Underworld are original, but what this film does well is take ideas that were established in the past and build on them more.  This is by no means a carbon copy of any of the films from which it borrows from.  Slow motion gun battles didn't originate with the Matrix films.  The most refreshing aspect of this movie is the story, which surprisingly has many layers and puts a totally fresh new spin on the vampire/werewolf stories.  This aspect, along with the excellent visual effects makes Underworld an enjoyable experience.  A sequel for this is inevitable, and I must say that I'm really looking forward to it.  Underworld was a very pleasant surprise. *** out of **** stars",8,184,246,4 February 2004
Dawn of the Dead," A new level of stupidity has been attained....
","***SPOILERS BELOW!***I went into this flick knowing what to expect.  Horror movie.  Okay, silly people doing stupid things with some gore and mindless killing.  Fine, I'm a fan of horror flicks when they're done right; last year's Freddy vs. Jason was pretty good.  I don't think I've ever been more disgusted at a movie than I am with Dawn of the Dead.  Granted, I haven't seen the original so I can't compare it to this 'remake'.  But a new level of stupidity has been attained with DOD.  The movie started out pretty good - the way the 'calm ordinary day' to 'utter chaos and insanity' switch was shown was very well done.  I'll admit, it had me hooked.  However, the movie quickly went deeper and deeper into pure stupidity.  I can suspend my disbelief but so far, but this is too much!  They can't be serious:The girl takes one of the few remaining trucks and risks her life and the life of all the other survivors to save 'Chips'...a stupid dog she's only known for a day or so?  And what was up with these idiots waiting until 'infected' people died and turned into zombies to kill them?  How stupid can you be????  How stupid was Mekhi Phifer?  He actually thought his baby was going to be normal?  He knew what he was doing was wrong, or else why did he have his wife tied to the bed?  He knew EXACTLY what was happening (his wife was bitten and was going to turn), yet he gets mad at the old lady and kills her because she had sense to kill his now-zombie wife - saying 'you're threatening my family?'  WHAT???  Your wife is a ZOMBIE you idiot!  LMAO! What the HELL were the writers thinking with this CRAP??  What was the point of them wheeling in the fat dying lady?  She was no use to anyone anyway and she was bitten...KILL HER!  And Ana, she's seen all that has gone on - when someone is bitten it's only a matter of time before they 'die' and become a zombie.  So why o why is she pleading with Michael to come along with them on the boat where they're SAFE, saying she could 'help him', knowing he's going to turn?  Just HOW IN THE HELL did she intend on 'helping him'?? The stupidity of this movie truly knew no bounds, and this is what ultimately kills it.As I said earlier I'm a fan of horror movies; Halloween, Friday the 13th, Freddy flicks are among my favorites.  So I know what these movies are like and expect silliness (i.e. a chick laying down and blood drops on her from above and she asks 'where is this coming from'?? lol).  But DOD is on another level as far as stupidity goes.  I could not have watched the same film as everyone else, because my friends and I were all disgusted with this joke of a 'horror' flick..and yet it gets all these good reviews.  There's absolutely NO character depth (didn't expect much to begin with) and the plot is beyond brainless - we don't even find out how/why all of this is happening.  DOD is complete NONSENSE; a disgrace of a movie that tries to be a 'horror' flick (I don't even count as one since it isn't the least bit scary).  What a pathetic waste of time & money.  28 Days Later is FAR superior; anyone who says otherwise is deluding themselves.½* out of **** stars.  What could have been....",1,9,18,28 March 2004
42," Another white-washed effort that was SUPPOSED to be about a African-American Legend.
","I expected disappointment with this film ever since I saw the trailer....I wasn't going to even bother with it because it was pretty easy to see the direction they were going in, and they didn't even try to mask it. It was plainly obvious that this was going to be more about the white people involved than the actual subject of the film, Jackie Robinson. He's essentially relegated to an extra in the movie. Hollywood couldn't even bring themselves to call the film 'The Jackie Robinson Story'. Actually, that may be a good thing?? because that would've been even MORE misleading.One would be foolish to not realize that there had to be at least some whites who weren't so full of racist ideologies and bigotry to be willing to entertain the idea of a black man in major league baseball; the crime here is the notion that Jackie was merely a spectator throughout the whole experience. The filmmakers completely castrated the man whose story they're supposedly telling! They reduced him to a little (black) boy amongst (white) men. This movie's view is that Jackie Robinson had absolutely NOTHING to contribute to his legend and the game of baseball other than the color of his skin and 'superhuman' ability. 'Superhuman'?? REALLY?? They really snuck that in there like people wouldn't realize! I refuse to believe that Jackie Robinson was nothing more than a toothless, ever-willing black man with an anger problem who just happened to be picked by some quasi-sympathetic, money-hungry white man to make history. We see nothing of Jackie coming up, honing his skills..we get no insight into the MAN. He plays second fiddle to Harrison Ford's character.....whose REAL motivation was only to get the 'nigger-money'. Jackie could do nothing himself, his hand was held and he was patted on the back by the few 'good white folk' who really 'cared' about him. When he was down and out from all the badgering by the racist whites, ol' Harrison Ford comes to the rescue, gives him a pep talk, hugs him, pats him on the back and all is well. GIVE ME A DAMN BREAK!! I truly am sick and tired of the same old racist, half-assed attempts by Hollywood when it comes to Black stories....in the end it's ALWAYS about white people! I rather they just don't even bother trying to tell a Black story at ALL....hell it's not like they tried here? But what else is new in white-controlled Hollywood? Watching '42' only made me respect Spike Lee even more for what he accomplished with 'Malcolm X' back in '92. He stood up and made a BLACK film about a BLACK hero from the BLACK perspective, regardless of the setbacks and drama he received from the studio....resulting in his best work and one of the greatest films of the 20th century. This is the worst kind of film, COMPLETELY misleading and white-washed to oblivion. One of the worst, most insulting films I've ever seen. I expected to get what I got, I just had no idea HOW bad and bold it could be.....bold in that the didn't even TRY. They put NO EFFORT into telling JACKIE ROBINSON'S story. This movie is nothing more than a slap in the face and another stark reminder to Black People that if we want our stories told, only WE can tell them if we want it told right....or in the case of '42', even told at all!ZERO out of 10.",1,11,30,27 July 2013
Rocky V," This series should've ended after Rocky IV...
","This movie was just all wrong.  There's no other way to say it.  Reading some reviews on here I'm suprised to see that some people can watch this movie and really like it.  Now I'll admit, I see what they were trying to do by, in a way, revisiting the atmosphere and grittiness of the original Rocky...but this was just not the way to do it.  Rocky gets injured and is forced to retire:  I'm okay with that idea...seeing that he wasn't really prone to blocking during his fights.  The reason this film spoils the series is because it simply shatters everything that was built up in the previous four parts.  Parts I through III all had good stories, making them pretty good drama/sports films.  In pt I he's coming up just trying to get a chance, and does.  In pt II he had gotten so close, he gets a rematch and finally wins the title.  In pt III (my favorite) he stays on top but loses his hunger and his edge....so a hungry fighter coming up defeats him (Clubber Lang) and he has to go back to basics and regain the edge to climb back to the top.  I was okay with those 3.  Rocky IV was propaganda at its worst...USA vs the evil Russians, tasteless and preposterous.  Here in pt V, Rocky can't fight anymore, but what's worse is that he loses all his money due to his deadbeat brother-in-law, so he's forced to go back to the 'hood where he came up; his wife, used to expensive jewelry and fur coats and sports cars now has to work in the same pet store she did in the original.  Why was Paulie still allowed to hang around Rocky & Co after blowing all their money away?  How did Rocky's son age 5 years between pt IV and pt V??  It was bad enough we were losing key characters as the series went along (Mickey, Apollo, hell we almost lost Adrian in pt II), but now in pt V we gotta see Rocky right back where he was in the original, wearing the same black leather jacket and hat, except he's more of a nutcase.  That is VERY hard to accept after we went on a long ride hoping he succeeded...it's just very hard to swallow as a fan. If he had a couple more fights and then had to bow out gracefully for fear of greater injury and retire is one thing.  Close out the series with him on top.  But Sly and Co. somehow found it would be cool to strip away everything the Rocky character built in the previous 4 films, and this is what's most uncomfortable about Rocky V.  Like Terminator 3, I just refuse to acknowledge Rocky V's existence in my mind.  The most unnecessary sequel of all time along with T3 & Godfather III.* out of **** stars.",1,3,10,29 August 2004
Public Enemies," Good film. Another success for Mann; Depp is an amazing actor
","Just saw this today; as I was pretty eager to see it. Michael Mann directing, and Johnny Depp, one of the great actors of today, in the leading role. The length didn't bother me, as I was engrossed in the film throughout. The acting all around I thought was very good, and there isn't enough I could say about Michael Mann's direction. Ever since Heat and The Insider, I've become a big fan of his; and he doesn't disappoint here. The HD shots are pretty amazing, and he wows us again with his mastery of shootout scenes.Johnny Depp..boy has he grown on me the last few years. What a great talent he is; I can say with great confidence that he is one of the finest actors of our time. When I saw how much of a fan I was of his performance in the first Pirates of the Caribbean, (and that's saying a helluva lot), that made me realize just how talented he is; and boy does he give a great performance here. I couldn't see anyone else play this role with the same subtlety, confidence and sheer excellence as Depp. After seeing the poster for this film; with his sly grin holding the Tommy Gun, I just knew I was gonna be in for a treat seeing him in action, and he definitely didn't disappoint. He was just perfect in the role. Christian Bale was very good as well; more voice manipulation from him. He was very convincing and a good balance for Depp. Another great talent. The leading lady was very good as well; she has a innocent sexiness about her, and it worked very well. The film took a little while to really get going, but once it did, it was relentless. Another point on the shootout scenes; there's something about the way Mann does them that's just incredible. The lack of music, and the sheer deadliness of the sounds of the weapons make it seem so real.Mann executed them perfectly yet again.The few reviews I read for Public Enemies before watching it for myself complained that they (the critics) didn't learn who John Dillinger really was. Well, I can live with that. This wasn't exactly painted as a biopic like, for example, Ali or Ray. Seeing Michael Mann's name attached to this made it obvious to me that it was gonna be a crime saga picture, a la Heat & Collateral. The sugar on top was that its the story of John Dillinger's last days as the infamous hardened criminal. For what the film WAS, I can appreciate it and enjoyed it. Its a snapshot in time of a person's life. Simple. It seems like the critics wanted more preaching, or to do deep into Dillinger's psyche and motives. My question is: because you DIDN'T get that makes Public Enemies a bad film? I totally disagree. Michael Mann is one of the best directors out there today, and has achieved success yet again with his latest offering. The fact that he didn't delve more into Dillinger's life, what made him who he was and what made him tick has not (and should not) have any negative impact on the work of art that he's given us. And that's exactly what it is.a work of art.",8,1,3,11 July 2009
Spider-Man 2," Very Overrated!!!
","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW***Now I was disappointed with the first Spiderman?.it just didn't seem to hit home with me as it seemed to with everyone else. The hype behind this Spiderman movie franchise is what drives it, because this sequel is just as good as the first..... in other words, not that good.I've heard everyone, from most critics, including Ebert, to many of my peers, that this was simply a GREAT movie, guys like Ebert went so far as to say that Spiderman 2 is 'the greatest superhero movie ever'. I only have one thing to say to that: YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!Did anyone see 'Batman' (1989)? Or how about 'Superman'? How could ANYONE compare this campy movie to those two superhero CLASSICS?? This flick does absolutely nothing new?more of Mary Jane looking and acting retarded, more of the CG Spiderman swinging all over NY, more of Peter Parker fumbling all over himself, and another villain who just drops by sparingly and engages in some unrealistic fight scene with Spidey. This was very lazy film-making IMO, they just handed the audience the same old formula used in the first one?making this sequel very dry, but somehow more campy and corny. I can't believe all of the praise this film is getting?.with talk about how its soooo much better than the first?it's basically the same movie!! Peter doesn't want to get with MJ for fear of luring her to danger, though he ends up doing it anyway; some villain was just born wreaking havoc all over NY, Parker's so-called best friend is jealous of him?yada yada yada. Spiderman is no 'superman', so how does he takes the falls and bumps he does and get up like nothing happened?? What makes the world of Batman so realistic is the fact that he can indeed get hurt. and it's easy to relate to him. Same with Superman; he actually has superpowers but still seemed more realistic than Spiderman here. Everything in Spiderman 2 just seemed so lame; he doesn't want to be Spiderman anymore, so just when things start to look up for Peter 'The Ultimate Loser' Parker, he quickly learns that they're not. All of a sudden because his 'mind' isn't into his crime-fighting occupation he can't do his basic abilities. Were the writers really serious with that? He got bit by a spider, so the spider traits are a PART of him! But no, just because he's having a hard time at school, can't pay his rent and is too much of a punk to confess his love to MJ, he can't scale walls and constantly runs out of web?? How ludicrous! Hell, I felt more sympathy for Doc Ock than I did for Peter Parker, he was just TOO MUCH of a loser for me to feel sorry for him. Kirsten 'Dunce' still sucks, she's just hideous. Tobey Maguire is average as Parker, he's too much of a wimp to be taken seriously IMO. Green Goblin's son tries to portray himself as some big shot, going to board meetings and what not?give me a break, he's like 20!! What's even worse is that they're setting up part 3 with him as the villain (yes Green Goblin yet again), wow that ought to be great! LOL please. Who absolutely stole the show to me was Jameson, the leader of the newspaper. He was hilarious; the only character I liked. I'll just say this about Spiderman 2: Don't Believe The Hype! It's not as good as everyone's saying it is. I knew I'd be disappointed, because it was just common sense for me to realize that it couldn't be THAT much better than the very average original, contrary to what critics were saying. This is a very average, flawed movie that doesn't deserve to be even MENTIONED among the past great superhero movies. ** out of **** stars.

Finding Nemo," Very 'cute' movie
","I shied away from this originally, but was finally forced to watch it with my 3 year old cousin.  This is a very good movie.  Yea its a kiddie film, but it appeals to all ages.  Its very funny, Ellen DeGeneres in particular was a riot.  The variety of characters all had something to contribute to the overall feel-good adventure vibe of the film.  The animation is AMAZING...technology has really come a long way; I found myself in total awe throughout the film at how beautiful and detailed the environment was...wonderful.  For what it sets out to do, Finding Nemo does it flawlessly...and you can't ask for much more in a movie.  Easily one of the best animated films I've seen.**** out of **** stars",8,0,1,8 January 2004
Constantine," Nothing stellar, but not too bad
","I wasn't really looking forward to seeing this, but I was willing to sit through it. Keanu gives a typical Keanu performance, taking from his performance(s) in the Matrix trilogy and (I didn't think it was possible), dumbing himself down even more. I'm not a fan of Rachel Weisz, and she didn't sell herself at all in this film. One of the coolest characters in the film is the devil; if only the horrid Blade Trinity could've been smarter in casting that character, it would've been a tiny bit better lol. I was entertained with this film; it's your basic popcorn film but it is definitely not one of those films I took with me when I left the theater.

The Others," Extremely slow, very cheesy screenplay, and just plain BORING....
","I've just seen 'The Others', and let me say right off that i wasn't too impressed with the preview.  But with the other choices of films that are out there now, this was one if the few films I was willing to have hope in. Unfortunately, 'The Others' doesn't deliver at all.  This film is extremely slow...for the simple fact that 2 hours are wasted with bare minimum movement in the storyline - to end up a cheesy, wasteful, tasteless finale blatantly comparable to 'The Sixth Sense' is a total waste of $10, and a insult to intelligent film-goers.  I wouldn't even spend the $4-$5 renting this movie when it gets on VHS/DVD.  You plan on going to the movies soon? I suggest seeing some of the 'other' films, just walk on by this one.

Troy," So this is what a $200 million movie looks like....
","**POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW!!**If Troy is a true representation of what $200 million looks like on celluloid, then there should be a government law prohibiting that feat from ever being achieved again.  Obviously, Wolfgang Peterson & Co. could've done a MUCH better job with the budget they had; what they give us is an uninspiring, flat and soul-less 'epic'...if you could call it that.  Troy just doesn't have the feel that it's obviously looking for.  For all that money and big CGI-cluttered battle scenes, this 2 1/2 hour film failed to move me....and that's a pretty amazing thing to do if one thinks about it. As far as casting goes, the only actors that are worth mentioning are Brian Cox, Peter O'Toole and, especially, Eric Bana, who was just excellent in his role.  Hector was the only character you could really feel for, there was so much sincerity in his acting you couldn't help but root for him.  Now, onto supposed 'star' of the film........Brad Pitt was just horrible in his role as Achillies.  It was apparent to me as soon as he appeared on screen for the first time that he was just NOT the right person for this part.  NOTHING about him in this movie screamed 'Greek warrior'.  It was more like 'California surfer dude'.  What a terrible casting choice.  He was probably chosen because they were aiming for the summer blockbuster and figured all the females would pay the $9-10 to see Brad Pitt's body.  In that respect they'll probably succeed, but as far as his performance/his ability to help carry the film, he was simply a disaster.  It's a shame that Orlando Bloom still gets work....the boy just CAN'T ACT!!  His Paris moved right up there on my 'Most Annoying Charactes of All Time' list....I wrote the movie off when I saw that he was going to live through the film.  I'm just happy that, after reading another review on here, that his surviving and killing Achillies DID NOT happen the real story by Homer.  And what was the deal with Briseis killing Agamemnon??? Obviously Homer's classic was Hollywood-fied beyond measure.... whatever happened to just taking a story AS IS and putting it on screen??? 
What's so sad about Troy is the fact that all that money was put into it and it still comes out so mediocre.  Nowhere near the prestige and excellence of other war epics such as Gladiator, Braveheart, hell even The Patriot is better!  It just doesn't come off as genuine, you don't feel for any of the characters.  There was no sense of who was good from who was bad (don't know if the story projects this same dilemma), so that made it even harder to feel for anyone on screen.  Troy is just bad all around, some 'summer blockbuster' this turned out to be....pretty trashy movie.

Insomnia," A Masterpiece...
","It's been a good while since I've gone to the movies and seen a movie that FULLY met my expectations.  I had high expectations for Insomnia...with Al Pacino (one of my all time favorite actors), Robin Williams (who I DEFINITELY prefer in serious roles, remember 'Awakenings') and Christopher Nolan, who did Memento...I really expected this film to be something special.  This film is simply a masterpiece.  The whole look of the film, the wonderful, engaging story and the aura that Nolan presents with his filmmaking is just brilliant.  Pacino and Williams were absolutely awesome in this film...I feel there should be Oscar nominations for these two...Pacino especially.  This film is HIGHLY recommended, I don't remember the last time I came out of a movie theater as satisfied as I was with Insomnia.  This is easily the best film I've seen so far this year.",9,0,0,27 May 2002
Cloverfield," A good concept that ultimately fails..a letdown
","As like most people, I was intrigued to see 'Cloverfield', mainly because I wanted to see what was causing all the havoc in the preview. After finally watching the movie, unfortunately, I still can't tell you. What does that tell you? This is one of those movies where you just happen to drop in on an event of some kind and then decide to leave at some point. Things just happen, and then it's over. There's no explanation whatsoever as to what the monster is, where it came from, how it 'works' and what exactly happened in the end. We barely see it, which is inexcusable considering we've actually WATCHED (what we COULD watch anyway) the movie at this point. I could only guess that the military bombed the city but there's no indication as to whether or not the monster was actually killed. The shaky POV camera is a cool concept; it's creative.I could really appreciate the approach they were attempting. However, at some point it must be remembered that the audience is attempting to WATCH a movie, and it was damn near impossible to do so. There was just TOO MUCH movement with the camera that most of the time you couldn't tell what was going on.and after a while the whole shakiness of it all got pretty annoying. Again, I see where they were trying to go with this, but the audience has to make some sort of sense of what's going on, or else what's the point? I don't know if Marlena suffered from 'Alien fate' and a baby monster ripped through her, or if the soldiers actually put her out of her misery after realizing she was bitten.with only one viewing I thought it was the latter, but who knows? Speaking of the characters, they were all pretty annoying; especially the 'cameraman', Hud. His job, along with cameraman, was to provide comic relief throughout; but he's not funny at all and is just a stupid idiot. We're forced to listen to him say the most asinine things and repeat them 20 times. After a while I said to myself, 'enough already, shut up and run!' I really wasn't sorry for him in the end. We get a pretty cool close-up of the monster before he does away with one of the characters, but again, we're still left in the dark as to what it is exactly. Throughout the movie we get bits and pieces of it, never getting a definitive shot of it.Another thing, how in the hell did that camera make it through the film? It should have been destroyed either by being dropped as many times as it was or, and this is much more likely, the battery dying.HELLOOOO!!!! There is no way that camera would've lasted through all of these occurrences. Also, maybe I'm behind the times, but.since when did video cameras have night vision? Anyway, the audience is left with as many questions as it had when it first saw the teaser trailer with explosions and the head of the Statue of Liberty (poor woman) flying through the air; with no movie title or nothing. HUGE letdown if you ask me. I'll admit, it all came off as pretty realistic due to the shaky camera technique, but that only led to the huge downside of the audience essentially not being able to watch the movie. I was really into it.but I was waiting for some answers and didn't get any. 'Cloverfield' had GREAT potential, but fails in the end.6/10",6,2,4,12 February 2008
Scary Movie 2," this movie is HORRIBLE!!
","I can't believe how terrible this movie is!  Well, actually I can.  I never thought a film could be this horrible.

Alien," A bit overrated?. (my 100th review)
","I bought this DVD, thinking it's a certified classic and that I'm bound to enjoy it immensely...seeing that I'm a big fan of sci-fi movies. After watching it, I thought I missed something. Was this really it? After realizing my less-than-enthusiastic thoughts on what I had just seen, I immediately rationalized that I did just watch the movie 25 years later, and that there's probably no way I can get the effect that audiences had when it first released. So much has happened in movies nowadays, that I've basically seen it all. I appreciate what Ridley Scott tried to do here, by letting us wait, and wait, and wait, and wait some more. It's Hitchcockian, and I'm a big fan of his. 'Alien' is more suspense than anything, it seemed that after the suspense is gone, and everything that was supposed to happen happened, and the alien was finally revealed in all its glory, there isn't much left to hold on to. For some reason, 'Alien' comes off as incomplete and, surprisingly, unintentionally funny at some points. I just couldn't get past the fact that the events in the film could've been avoided if it wasn't for the utter stupidity of the crew members. 'Alien' wasn't scary by any means. The alien itself is marvelous; I was always intrigued by the creature, just the look of it! Only a crazy mind could've come up with something looking like that. I've read some reviews here on IMDb stating that the sequel 'Aliens' is superior to the original, I'll have to see that to decide for myself. Also, I only watched the Theatrical version on my DVD, maybe I'll be able to appreciate the Director's Cut more?although I read in the DVD pamphlet that the Theatrical version is Ridley Scott's favorite. Therefore, I'm giving 'Alien' a pass of sorts, seeing that it's a landmark in a genre that's been squeezed dry for so long now. Maybe with future viewings I can come to enjoy it even more, but my initial reaction is that 'Alien' wasn't what I expected. I can still appreciate it for the pioneer that it is, but it seems a bit overrated.** ½ out of **** stars",6,8,17,27 July 2004
The Doors," I got the feeling there was more to Jim Morrison than this.....
","I first watched Oliver Stone's The Doors many years ago....I was only about 13 and didn't know any better.  Since then I've grown as a person and opened myself to all types of music, and am now a fan of The Doors' music. Watching this movie again now on the Bravo channel, I have a totally different outlook on the film (maybe my first outlook, since I was so young when I first saw it).  Basically, I can't help but feel that there was so much more to Jim Morrison than what Stone chose to portray in his film.  Now that I've listened (and continue to listen) to the Doors' music, based on the music alone I know that there was more to Jim Morrison.  There was a beauty with Morrison and, quite frankly, it's not shown here.  Stone's film is very one-dimensional, which is an inconceivable crime to commit seeing how multi-dimensional Morrison was....even his music alone!  I'm not saying that he didn't lead a wild life of sorts, but Stone paints Morrison as if that was all he was.  He doesn't delve into the man and his music....it's just a rock star living the wild life who just happens to be a pretty damn good lyricist/entertainer.  To make his talent a sidenote is very irresponsible in my opinion, and that is what kills the movie.  I don't think Stone poured himself into a movie, where it really HURT the film, more than The Doors.  Natural Born Killers was basically his story, his baby....so you can put yourself in the film, as you're making a point about an issue.  But you can't do that with a so-called bio flick, it takes so much away from the person you're trying to tribute/acknowledge.  The effort is there, but The Doors is overdone and unfortunately not truly representative of the subject (Morrison).** out of **** stars.P.S.  This is Val Kilmer's best performance ever....and the casting of Meg Ryan was a BIG mistake.",Null,2,2,10 April 2004
Lost in Translation," A beautiful, heart-warming film
","**POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW**Lost In Translation is one of those films that I appreciated more, the more I watched.  I wasn't liking it much in the beginning; I felt it was slow and just a bit too artsy and weird (by weird I'm referring to the eccentric, 'colorful', disjointed Tokyo setting) to really like it.  I almost felt like Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) felt as I was watching LIT... suffering from major culture shock, not being able to settle into things initially.  But as the film progressed I was drawn more and more into the characters, the story and its settings.  The subtle growth of the connection between Bob and Charlotte was just beautiful to witness, and acted WONDERFULLY by Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.  Murray's performance has to be the most subtle, quiet Oscar-nominated performance I've ever watched.  The way he was able to express himself, not verbally but visually with his facial expressions and mannerisms, was evidence of the true talent he has as an actor.  I felt Johansson should've been recognized with an Oscar nod for her great work here as well...she was excellent alongside Murray; they made the perfect couple on-screen.  The ending was perfect for the film; I knew they couldn't get together in the end, but for all that they went through during their time in Tokyo I at least wanted Bob and Charlotte to acknowledge what they had.  I wanted them to give themselves closure to the time they spent together, and how much they really meant to one another, and they did that. It was a very romantic and heart-warming ending, and was very fitting for the film; in my opinion, any other ending would've hurt the movie.In regards to LIT winning an Oscar for Best Screenplay, I really can't see why it won.  There was some great dialogue spoken between Bob and Charlotte, particularly when they were on the bed together, but almost half of the film was in Japanese!  The screenplay just didn't jump out at me the way past winners (i.e. Usual Suspects) did.  I won't be suprised if Japanese people were a bit upset at how they were portrayed here; they really came off as warped & spaced-out.  I know better than to let a movie tell me how a culture is, but I couldn't help but ask myself if that's really how things are in Tokyo.  Lost In Translation is a beautiful film, and worth the fame and praise it got.  Kudos to Bill Murray and the beautiful Scarlett Johansson for their EXCELLENT performances.  For me, LIT is a film that will not be forgotten anytime soon.  Truly a heart-warming (can't describe it any other way), memorable experience that will be cherished for a long time.***1/2 out of **** stars.",9,2,7,28 June 2004
Predator," The quintessential action movie. One of my favorite films of all time.
","Predator is the classic action film.  What makes it so unique is that the story starts off as a simple but exhilarating rescue mission; but then it suddenly switches gears and becomes a fight for survival for everyone involved.  The genius of that!  The cast is wonderful; Arnold as Dutch was very convincing and commanding, yet humbled and low-key in his performance. The only way you would know that he's the star is that his face is on the cover, he's the leader of the group, and he survives at the end.  He was 'one of the crew' instead of a one-man wrecking machine like in so many of his other films; that was very nice to see.  Carl Weathers turns in a good performance as Dillon, as does Bill Duke as Mac, Jesse Ventura as Blain and Sonny Landham as Billy.  The whole cast worked very well together. 
The one thing that still astonishes me to this day, 16 years later, is indeed the Predator.  The special effects in this film was very much ahead of its time, the camouflage was pure genius.  I still can't believe my eyes when I see the camouflage effects; it blows me away that even now in 2003 it could sit alongside the FX seen in TODAY'S films with no shame.  I'm waiting for Fox to put out a special edition DVD with behind the scenes footage explaining how the Predator was done; from the effects with its sight and the beautiful camouflage, to the suit.  I caught a little snippet of a behind the scenes feature on AMC or Bravo, and ever since I've been anticipating its inclusion on a new DVD (WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?!??!) 
Predator is evidence of how action films should be done.  A great story and relentless action, all progressing the story along. A timeless classic, one of the best films of all time.**** out of **** starsP.S.  The 'forest massacre' scene is one of the funniest scenes in movie history!!",10,257,312,9 December 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," DON'T BELIEVE THE 'HATE'!!!
","***SPOILERS INCLUDED!!*** When I came onto IMDb to see how its members rated Matrix Revoutions, I was shocked. 6.6/10? Could a franchise so promising fall by the wayside so quickly? Then I read some external reviews. Many other critics were bashing it as well. After seeing it a couple days ago, now that it all sunk in, all I have to say is 'Don't Believe The Hate!!!' The Matrix trilogy will be forever tainted, because it was ahead of its time. The masses weren't ready. When the original was released in 1999, it was a sleeper hit; a new phenomenon was born, new grounds were broken in film. It was the perfect combination of astounding visuals and an intellectually challenging story. Matrix Reloaded was 'The Matrix times 2'. More characters, more story, more action, more questions. Quite frankly, it went over many people's heads. It took too much brain power for the masses. The problem with people is that they can't look at things objectively. Once Reloaded was  released, everyone had an opinion as to what happened, and what was going to happen. That's okay, that was why it was left open, to anticipate how it will end. But as ignorant and foolish as people are, they took themselves too seriously and thought that their opinion was SUPPOSED to happen. So when Revolutions finally came, if the story didn't go or end the way they thought it would, or the way they thought it SHOULD end, they were quick to bash the film. WHAT IGNORANCE! Is this YOUR story? NO! Did anyone really expect the other 2 films to be as 'fresh' as the original? Everyone loves the original because, more than anything else, it was new and fresh. There's NO WAY that feeling could ever be duplicated....GET OFF IT!! Now onto Revolutions....
This trilogy couldn't have ended any other way, and it was done very well. Sure there was some corny dialogue, but all 3 films have corny dialogue. People forget that there wasn't much action in the original; Reloaded and Revolutions have much more. I've heard people complain about the lack of characters in Revolutions as compared to Reloaded....uh those characters are all based in the MATRIX....this film is about ZION, hence you won't see them much, if at all. People say 'they didn't explain 'Persephone's kiss'. What about it? She kissed everyone, including Niobe and Ghost....so what? Since when was that an integral part to the story? The story in this is just as good as in the other two. The visual effects are simply AMAZING; the Zion battle will go down in history as one of the most amazing achievements EVER in film. I think they've topped themselves with each film. Sure, there's questions still not answered/to be asked, but for God's sake, use your brain a little! Go watch something like that so-called remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Scary Movie 3 if you want everything handed to you like babies. The action also was on the same level as the last two if not better; its definitely better than the original. The acting was better, Keanu Reeves was very good, Laurence Fishburne came back to form and Hugo Weaving again steals the show. I'm sure many people were fooled by how the original caught on like wildfire. After seeing the complete story, and seeing the response, its even more apparent that The Matrix trilogy is NOT FOR EVERYONE! If you didn't like it, then it wasn't for you. But don't just hate on it because of your thoughts on how the story should've gone; that's not fair and is very ignorant. The Wachowski brothers are telling the story, remember? This is the best trilogy of our time definitely. Lord of the Rings? PLEASE! I laugh at the ludicrous thought! I thank the Wachowski's for giving us their vision, it was a GREAT ride. *** out of **** stars. P.S. PLEASE end the trilogy here! It's fine just how it is! Don't do a 4th film! PLEASE!",9,2,4,11 November 2003
Armageddon," Well that's two hours I'll never get back.....
","My GOD this has to be one of the absolute worse movies I have EVER seen! Michael Bay is at it again with the 'all style and entirely NO substance' approach.  Its just AMAZING to me that so many big names were involved in this movie and its still THIS BAD!  Talk about asinine!  The whole plot is just ludicrous.an asteroid is coming towards Earth to destroy us all..the only people who could save us?  Oil drillers!  Train them until the absolute last possible day before this big rock hits us and send them up there like astronauts so they could dig into it, drop a nuke, get out of there and detonate the bomb.  This is where the person with sense would say, wouldn't the pieces from the explosion still hit Earth anyway?  Hark!  Bay & Co. have the answers to that one...detonate the nuke before you cross this boundary between it and Earth and the pieces should just miss our planet!  Are you KIDDING ME???I still can't believe this trash was even made.  And the fact that it made as much money as it did bewilders me.  There's escapist entertainment, that still somehow makes sense and is somehow logical, and then there's Armageddon, which is just too stupid and ridiculous to even NOT be taken seriously.  I knew what to expect going in, but its one of those things where you don't think it will ever be as bad as you think it would be.  In this case its even WORSE!  Just how in the hell did they manage to do that? Easy.  By having NO script and a load of talentless 'superstars' (i.e. Ben Affleck).  Ben Affleck was one of the most worthless, stupidest characters I've ever witnessed in a movie.  What was his purpose?.... to just mess everything up and be as inept as possible?  The acting was horrible, which doesn't help the fact that the 'script' is pure nonsense.  Everyone just took the idea of the world ending too calmly..giving Bruce Willis & Co (our 'heroes') ample and frequent times to complain and bicker to each other about stupidness.  Uh, we're here to save the world.maybe this isn't a good time?!?!?!  Could SOMEONE have a BIT of sense here?  Oh, there was the self-proclaimed genius, Steve Buscemi (what the hell was HE thinking??) who was the only logical one until he came down with 'space dementia'. WHAT????
This is the perfect example of a movie having all the fancy decorations and brand names to cover up its total idiocy.  What really got me was how the surface of this asteroid was as smooth as newly paved streets for everyone to just drive/stroll around so easily.  I can employ my suspension of disbelief but so far, but the Evel Knievel jump made by Affleck on the armadillo was THE LAST STRAW for me!  I said 'two hours' in my summary because that's how much of the 153 minute drivel of a movie I was able to tolerate before almost breaking my sacred player trying to get the rented DVD out of it (how I removed the disc from my player without breaking it is a mystery).  I didn't see the last half hour or so and I truly don't care to know/see what happens.  I have been scarred for life watching this garbage, though I'm still recuperating from the torturous experience.  From now on I now know to stay FAR FAR AWAY from Michael Bay movies..Pearl Harbor, Bad Boys 2, and now Armageddon???  This takes the cake.  Those were two precious hours of my life that I could never get back.

American Psycho," Great movie (although it took 2 viewings to realize it)....
","Now, I'll admit, the first time I saw this film, I hated it.  I thought the whole thing was just a silly, sick attempt at filmmaking.  But a couple of weeks ago, it was on cable and I watched it again and realized how great it is.  The ending really confused me the first time, but then i realized that the fiasco in the end didn't really happen.  This is a good film, and its VERY funny.

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," A disgrace to the Terminator franchise.
","Terminator 3......hmm.I saw this film reluctantly; after learning that James Cameron was not going to be involved, I immediately wrote it off. Being a BIG fan of the first 2 (the first one more), I just knew that this third installment was not going to live up to the excellence of the first 2 films. Well, I was right. Quite frankly, this should not have never been made. Why can't people leave things alone? The Terminator franchise, The Terminator idea, is James Cameron's and he and he ALONE should do these films. It's HIS brainchild, and if he isn't involved, the very idea of doing a sequel without him should be scrapped. But in the end, its all about money, isn't it?With all that said, this movie by itself isn't bad at all. Some pretty good action sequences keep you entertained. I was skeptical about there being a female Terminator, but she was good in her role. As a stand-alone action film, its not bad. But put alongside the first 2 Terminators, T-3 is....well......just 'there'. It's very bland and doesn't have a expand on the story enough to help keep the Terminator franchise in greatness. Essentially, it adds nothing to the saga shown brilliantly by the first 2. This just can't live up to the Terminator name, and has unfortunately tainted the name to some extent. Whose fault is that? Well, it could be the makers of T-3 for even trying to make a sequel, or it could be the first 2 Terminators for being that damn good. Either way, this should never have happened, and I pray to God there isn't a 'T-4'. ** out of **** stars.",7,0,0,18 August 2003
"I, Robot"," Okay, better than I originally anticipated....
","Seeing the preview for 'I, Robot', and realizing immediately the blatant rip-off from The Matrix franchise as far as storyline and SFX goes, and Will Smith in yet ANOTHER futuristic, ID4-type role, I didn't expect much here. After seeing it yesterday, I must say that it was better than I thought it would. I'm not a fan of Will Smith at all; and he gives usual performance here but it works. The SFX was very cool, it all looked smooth. However, the slo-mo shots were blatantly ripped off from The Matrix....I saw that as a quick cop-out, it's been done so much it's a really tired technique. The story was more layered than I expected, though still basic in essence it worked well. Watching 'I, Robot' I just felt that I couldn't fully appreciate the film....70% of it seemed to be CG! I was really expecting this to be total trash, but it really isn't. It's a nice little futuristic film with a surprisingly 'human' story, and because of that it has a chance of standing on its own as a sci-fi futuristic flick.**1/2 out of **** stars.",7,0,0,24 July 2004
American Beauty," VERY overrated, stereotypical, artsy NONSENSE!
","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW!!***People will most likely respond to my review as someone who 'didn't get' American Beauty.  What really is there to 'get'?  Critics and moviegoers alike swore by this film, and their praises were supposedly justified by the Academy, as they gave it 5 Oscars, including Best Picture, Actor & Director. Let me say that this film was by no means worthy of the praise and awards it got.  Watching this movie today let me FURTHER know how useless and unreliable the Academy is in recognizing REAL films.  Just put AB on the long list of films unworthy of the awards & recognition it received.
I just don't see the big deal with AB.  Everything I saw just came off as clichéd, worn out 'ideas', including crass overacting and a non-existent 'plot'.  What was the point of this movie?  Ok, it's a view of white middle class American suburbia; pretty obvious.  What else is there to grasp on here?  I'm actually surprised that the Academy/media has accepted the movie as much as they did.  They're actually PROUD of what was shown here to endorse it as much as they did?  Hmph!  It goes to show you how pathetic and backwards American culture is.  It is laughable at how horrible the execution of this film is.  It's not hard to see what the makers were trying to do; they just failed to do it.  There's no direction with the film, just a bunch of tired ideas thrown together supposedly to show people just how crazy, pathetic, misguided and plain stupid white America is.  Quite frankly it made me laugh at America even more.  It'll be interesting how foreign people thought of this movie, whether they were able to even critique it without bursting out in uncontrollable laughter at the thought of an ounce of this being true.There wouldn't have been much of a movie if the characters kept their damn window blinds shut.  It is comical things like this that pull the film deeper and deeper into utter stupidity by its end.  Kevin Spacey was good in his role, but it's nothing he hasn't done before.  His performance definitely did NOT deserve an Oscar.  It's the same ol' dull, 'barely keep ya eyes open, slur your lines' Spacey we've all come to know pretty well; nothing special.  Seeing his performance only cements my belief that Denzel Washington should very well have won the Best Actor Oscar for Hurricane, a FAR more meaningful performance.  I wouldn't have minded if Russell Crowe won for his EXCELLENT performance in The Insider, his best performance to date and also way better than Spacey's performance.  Annette Bening was just pathetic to watch, way too much overacting; just a sad, poor excuse of a 'performance'.  No one else is worth mentioning acting wise.
I don't see the beauty in this film.  The whole movie was just silly. Many people have already talked about it, but c'mon.. a plastic bag?  The makers just went out of their way to paint these suburban, middle-class whites as pathetic, stupid, meaningless and empty they really are.  A stalker weed head drug dealer who finds beauty in a plastic bag blowing in the wind and has a fetish for videotaping everything; a Marilyn Manson look-a-like daughter who likes getting naked in front of a window; her wannabe whorish friend who really hasn't 'done it' before and has a stupid, whorish opinion for everything; the most pathetic character of em all - the complete loser of a wife who's unfaithful and 'won't be a victim' when she actually causes, and deserves for that matter, everything that happens to her; and the ill-fated pedophile husband who feels he has to take control of his life by wacking off every morning in the shower and reliving his 'glory days' of the 60s - not limited to smoking weed, listening to Pink Floyd albums, and lifting weights to impress a 16 year old.  Can't forget the next door neighbor ex-Marine colonel who seems homophobic at first only to turn out to be gay himself; and the new male gay couple who just moved in trying to play like they're normal and make friends with everyone on the block.  I'm telling ya it doesn't get any better than this!  A world full of down-on-their-luck white so-called big wigs who don't know how to close their window blinds; and at the drop of a hat jump to complete lunacy and thoughts of suicide once things don't go their way.  All while that plastic bag blows in the wind.  'Look closer' they said.. for what?  You're not showing me anything I haven't seen before, not to mention you're showing it in the most illogical, far-fetched and utterly stupid fashion.  What a load of crap this 'movie' was.  There's a serious dogfight going on between AB and Titanic for the number 1 spot on my 'Most Overrated Films of All-Time' list.  AB is a terrible film; nothing but a big fraud - the likes I haven't seen since Titanic and Forrest Gump.  If this isn't a good case I don't know what would be but..DON'T believe the hype.  Number 29 on IMDb's Top 250..hell I won't even bother attempting to measure the credibility of that list anymore..now I've seen it all.  But why am I surprised?  LOTR ROTK is #4.  Calling American Beauty art is like saying feces is odorless...not only is it not, it's pretty rancid as well.ZERO out of **** stars.",1,8,20,3 April 2004
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Pretty enjoyable, just as the first one...
","Surprisingly, I enjoyed 'Madagascar' and was looking forward to the sequel. All in all, it's more of the same; about as much as you can expect from animated films, but its still enjoyable nonetheless. The penguins are an absolute riot, and were my favorite characters hands down, along with Julian. Solid 'storylines' with the four main characters but, again, its nothing really different. It was nice touch to see them finally come in touch with their 'roots', as Chris Rock's character hilariously put it. There was also pretty good humor throughout, just as there was in the original. Everything is executed well and makes for another enjoyable adventure. Not sure if a sequel is needed; if there are indeed serious talks about making one...because everything has been pretty much resolved with this one. *** out of **** stars.",8,1,2,16 February 2009
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Not as good as the original....
","Terminator 2, overall, is a good film. For its time (1991) the special effects is simply amazing. The whole story is excellent for a sci-fi film. But, the original is a better film on the whole. John Connor for example....is simply horrible in this film. I can't remember ever having to hear a voice more annoying than his in a movie. Because he is one of the main characters...we're forced to see him a lot, and unfortunately HEAR him a lot. There are certain scenes that are a bit corny or cheesy if you will... but I kinda expect that from James Cameron. Robert Patrick made himself pretty much here...I don't think anyone else could've played the T-1000 the way he did. The original Terminator was much more colder and darker....which I prefer for such a heavy story. I feel the story was more concrete in the original as well. Overall I enjoyed the film...despite the amazing special effects...I'm not sure if it surpasses 'The Predator', done 4 years earlier. I give it a 6/10...but the original was better. And now that I hear Cameron will not do Terminator 3, I highly doubt if I will even bother with that sequel.",6,0,1,2 October 2001
Dreamgirls," All show, hardly any substance...
","**CONTAINS SPOILERS** Saw this last night, wasn't too impressed. I went into Dreamgirls thinking it was a film along the lines of 'Ray' & 'Walk The Line'...a biographical film about a musician/music group. It turned out to be a full-blown musical, and I'm not much a fan of those. Nevertheless, I gave it a chance and came out a bit exhausted. WAAAY too much singing for my taste (a song was sang at an average of every 5 minutes), and NOWHERE near enough plot/story. Everything just happens. We got absolutely NO inclination that Beyonce & Jamie Foxx's characters were going to end up together, got hardly any evidence that would lead one to believe that Jennifer Hudson's character would be kicked out of the group. We're led to assume that Eddie Murphy & the 3rd Dreamgirl are together, and 20 mins later they break up. The filmmakers seem to just brush through everything, and it was still too long....that's very hard to do, and not at all good for a film.As far as performances, Jennifer Hudson was brilliant. This was my first time seeing/hearing about her (as I don't watch American Idol, etc.) and I was floored by how talented and powerful she was. No way was I expecting a newcomer to COMPLETELY outshine Beyonce the way she did; she not only out-shined her acting-wise, but also singing-wise. She simply blew Beyonce out of the water! Kudos to her, she deserves all the praise she's been getting and will continue to get. My main motivation for even watching this film was for Eddie Murphy, who did not disappoint. His performance was excellent, though I just couldn't stop laughing every time I saw him because all I could think of was Randy Jackson (one of the many characters he played in Coming To America).With a better, more fleshed-out story this film could've been great, but it's just marginal with a couple bright spots here and there (Hudson & Murphy).** out of **** stars.",4,2,6,15 January 2007
Collateral," Wonderful film! Michael Mann does it again!
","**POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW**Collateral is one of the best movies of the year.  Michael Mann takes us on another great ride, as only he can.  The documentary feel always works for me when it's done right, and Mann has a great way of using it without being distracting.  Masterful directing and cinematography, adding an eerie, realist aura to the film; making it that much more enjoyable and intriguing. Mann filmed and showed LA the way Coppola showed Tokyo in Lost In Translation'just letting the scenery speak for itself.  I don't know where he found the locations he used, but they set the mood perfectly.  I caught onto Mann ever since Heat'..there's something about his documentary, in-your-face style that is very intriguing, and I can't help but anticipate every film he directs.The acting was great all around; especially the two main characters, Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx.  Cruise makes a great turn as a villain; more and more he proves that he's versatile and I give him all the respect in the world for taking those types of risks.  Tom Cruise was just wonderful as Vincent, his performance was flawless; from his demeanor to the way he was handling the gun.  Foxx proves to me more and more every day that he's ready to take that next step.he was great in his role as the ill-fated cab driver.  With a recent string of stellar performances, he's moved himself into the realm of elite African-American actors, which is very few as it is. From Any Given Sunday, to Redemption, to Ali, to Collateral, and the upcoming Rayif he keeps this up he'll be a shoe-in for Tom Hanks status; it could be argued that he's there already.  Jada Pinkett-Smith does what she usually does in a supporting role, she came off more mature here.  The only negative I have as far as the acting goes is Mark Ruffalo as the detective; he never convinces me in his roles, and it was extremely hard for me to take him seriously here as a detective.  My only beef with the film, though not a major one at all, is the ending.  I didn't really mind the way it ended; but I wanted Vincent (Tom Cruise) to live.  I'm a person who roots for the bad guy, so I had hoped for Vincent to kill everyone he had to and get off scott-free.  Once I saw that Jada Pinkett was his last target, I knew the ending was going to be Hollywood-fied' and that he was going to die, obviously by Max's hands. Doesn't really hurt the film, but for my personal taste I would've liked to have seen Vincent triumph.  Collateral is a very smart, stylish thriller breathing much needed life into the genre.***1/2 out of **** stars.",9,0,1,16 August 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Got just about what I expected....
","***SPOILERS BELOW***I approached this film the same way I approached Freddy vs. Jason:   don't expect any Oscar caliber, genre-defining stuff, just sit down and enjoy yourself.  Fortunately, I was able to do that.  I'm a BIG fan of the original Predator; I consider it one of the best action films of all time. I'm not really familiar with the Alien series, only seeing the first one about a month ago.  Therefore I was fortunate to go into this film without too much of a bias....my only bias being that I'm a HUGE fan of the Predators and was rooting for them.This film isn't as bad as I heard it was, and as IMDb would lead one to believe.  It's not a terrible film by any means, but it could've been better.  I thought the PG-13 rating would've really hurt AVP but it really doesn't, and I was relieved by that fact.  It sounds very childish to hear so many people here bashing the movie because the Predators don't 'rip out any spines' from their prey....it's REALLY sad when people allow such gratuitous violence to dictate whether they 'enjoy' a movie.  Believe me, I could appreciate blood and guts like the next man, but don't bash a movie because they chose not to have such violence....it's not essential to film, its just icing on the cake.  The effect is still pretty much there.  The Predators are so damn cool, but I must say I underestimated the Aliens.  I didn't expect them to be as much competition for the Predators as they were. I could honestly say that I'm even more inclined to go and rent the two Alien sequels based on their showing in AVP.  My only real beef with the film is the ending.  Seeing Sanaa Lathan running side by side with the Predator.....well it seemed very cheesy, and pretty unlikely for that matter.  It just didn't seem right, granted that I vividly recall the Predator in the original picking off humans one by one...although the Aliens are the main prey here.  Maybe because she had their plasma gun the Predator was less threatened by her.  Besides, from what was told about their history, the Predators and humans did have a relationship all those years ago, albeit not an equal one since the Predators were looked at as gods.  So maybe the makers of the film were playing on the 'human helping/serving their god angle.  I guess I'll justify the cheesy aspect that way.  It was cool how they left the film open for a sequel.  Although it may seem that they have a lot to work with, they really don't because I can't see any way that that 'hybrid' alien is gonna survive on that ship full of Predators.  Anyhow, AVP overall is an enjoyable action/sci-fi film.  Of course it could've been better, but it's not terrible at all.

No Country for Old Men," Grossly overrated..unbelievably bland
","**SPOILERS!** Naturally I watched this due to all of the hype and praises surrounding it. I just don't get it. Although, seeing the Coen Brothers' name attached to this film, I should have known better. The first film I saw by them was Miller's Crossing.hated it. Finally rented Fargo from Netflix a month ago, watched it, wasn't impressed at allin fact I was annoyed by it. Third time's a charm, maybe? Not by a long shot.The Coens always have a high level of quirkiness to their films. Everything from the characters to the plot is a little off-kilter. This does NOT always translate into a great, intelligent film. Tarantino also possess this quality with his films and, a lot more so than not, it works. Not the case with the Coens, as their attempts always come off as forced. Stripped of any fluff, 'No Country For Old Men' is a film full of killing and rambling. First there's the hit-man, (Javier Bardem) who barely talks (and when he does, talks about coin tosses and other mundane things), walks around with a oxygen tank and a shotgun with a silencer (didn't know it was possible, but I must admit its kinda cool), blowing locks off doors and killing cops and honest citizens wherever he deems fit with no consequence to his actions from authorities, etc. There's the aging sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) who's becoming more detached from the world every day, due to its increasing insanity. Supposedly the movie is titled around this character, but he's only in about a third of the film, if that. Last but not least, there's the 'good-bad guy' (Josh Brolin), the silhouette you see in the movie's poster with the bag of money & rifle. He's another wanderer who happens to stumble on $2 million and a truckload of drugs, swipes the money and spends the rest of his time AROUND TOWN eluding the aforementioned hit-man who is after him. This is a guy who, while swiping the money, blows off the only remaining survivor's request for water; only to get up out of bed hours later in the middle of the night, fill a container of water and go BACK there with hopes of seeing that same survivor still clinging on to dear life. Needless to say, his hopes were squashed, and his problems multiplied tenfold when the people whose money/drugs were unaccounted for show up. We get an elongated cameo from another character (Woody Harrelson) who has a decent amount of screen time but whose character serves ABSOLUTELY NO PURPOSE to the story. As soon as we're introduced to him, he's done away with. The audience is forced to identify with Brolin's character because we follow him throughout his quest to make out with the money. Only problem is, he meets his fate in the most uninspiring, anti-climatic way possible. We see him alive, *cut*, we hear sirens, *cut*, we see him dead. We can only assume the hit-man got him.You'll also hear a lot about the ending to this film, if anyone can call it such. In a nutshell, hit-man gets to Brolin's wife, rambles on again about a coin toss (which she fails to participate in), cut to hit-man in a car leaving the scene when a horrible accident occurshe gives a kid $100 for his shirt and he walks away limping and bloody with a bone sticking out his arm. Cut to the aging sheriff again, who is now retired, talking to his wife about a dream he had about his father, black screen, the end. What a bunch of wannabe artsy NONSENSE! If you're going to tell a story, TELL IT! Enough of the spaced-out dialog and characters who do nothing to further the telling of the story. There must be something I'm not getting; 'Fargo' reeked of these attempts at this kind of humor and failed miserably; between beyond-annoying accents and a ho-hum approach to everything by everyone made it one of the most overrated films of the past 10 years. 'NCFOM' suffers from the same affliction. They go above and beyond to make things as 'weirdly fascinating', only covering up the lack of a coherent script and plot. I can suspend my disbelief to a point, depending on what type of film it is. But please, DON'T pass yourself off as a 'serious, intelligent crime drama'.only to have all these occurrences in your movie that makes absolutely no sense! You mean to tell me NO one gets wind of the hit-man walking around town as obvious as can be.even after he kills a policeman at the police station? I'm not even going to mention how he gets out of the handcuffs. You bring in Woody Harrelson's character whose led out to be some sort of bad ass who's eliminated ever so easilyhe minus well have played the idiot cop who turned his back on a prisoner and was strangled with handcuffs. Brolin waking up and going BACK to the crime scene that HE stole drug money from, taking water with him hoping the Mexican (or whatever he was) is still alive? HOURS later?? Beyond silly, over-pretentious crap, this movie is. I was seriously considering watching it again to see what I missed.but what's the point? The movie is flat-out garbage. How the Coens continue to get over on critics is beyond me.This will probably win a bunch at the Oscars, and it'll be yet another slap in the face to anyone who goes about life with sense. Then again, the Oscars really don't mean much of anything nowadays.Cuba Gooding Jr. now does Hanes commercials screaming about wearing other guys' underwear, 'Shawshank Redemption' to this day is better than 'Forrest Gump', and no one's heard from Roberto Benigni since 'Life Is Beautiful'. Want to see one of the truly great films of 2007 snubbed by the Academy? Watch 'Gone Baby Gone'. Stay away from this trash by all means.3/10",3,3,6,31 January 2008
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Along with the first film, maybe the best of the series
","MI4 is right up there with the first Mission Impossible film. The MI series has turned out to be one of the better action film series in the last decade or so. What's missing in MI4 is the lack of the one, main villain; but it doesn't detract too much. Known for big, elaborate set pieces, this one delivers a couple of the more memorable ones. Decent acting all around, the addition of Jeremy Renner is a welcome one, maybe they will stick with his character going forward, the way they did with Ving Rhames. Enjoyable; I'd be eager for the next one.P.S. Props to Brad Bird; there was now way I could imagine the director of 'The Incredibles' being able to handle this kind of material; it says a lot about his talent. Lets hope they get another worthy director for the next film; he did a very good job.8/10",8,7,11,24 December 2011
28 Days Later...," Was suprisingly good....
","This has all the markings of a horror flick, but to my suprise it really isn't.  It's a more human story, you could tell immediately that this wasn't made in Hollywood....and that automatically gives it a leg up on most other films.  This movie is straight to the point, and has no problem keeping your attention as you see the characters' journey go deeper and deeper into the apocalyptic circumstances.  How'd they get all those people off the streets for that long??  This was a good movie....a lot better than the advertising/word of mouth would let you believe.  It's not like a slasher flick, it actually has a good story/message.  It's a look into the human psyche when faced with its own survival.  It looks/feels like a 'disaster documentary' of sorts.  Suprisingly good.*** out of **** stars",7,1,2,3 December 2003
City of God," Wonderful film!
","**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**I hadn't heard anything about this film until the Oscar buzz started and I started seeing commercials for it on television.  I'll admit I was interested...the story seemed genuine.  After seeing it a couple days ago I have to say that I was pleasantly suprised at how good this film is!  It's very violent in nature, but it suits well with the feel of the movie...it didn't seem like overkill.  The style at which 'City of God' was filmed was amazing.  I loved how the makers found a way to use modern day techniques/tricks all while keeping a documentary-type realism look to it....like the use of a hand-held camera in certain shots, and a Matrix like shot with a rain drop in others.  The story is a gritty one and very intriguing.  Certain events were predictable (i.e. Benny's death), but overall the story was very engaging, and shocking to see how mindless and 'lost' these kids and the people in this city was.  It gave an unprecedented, first-hand look in the life of these hoods in Rio; like Scorcese did with Goodfellas, the makers gave that same 'behind the scenes' look and feel here...and it works wonders.  This is one of the best movies I've seen in a while, and I hope it is recognized at the Oscars.***1/2 out of **** stars.",9,0,2,29 February 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Disappointing; what's with all the over-hype???
","**SPOILERS INCLUDED**I must admit that I was surprised to see how much fanfare and praise LOTR: Fellowship of the Ring got when it was first released.  I'm not really a fan of fantasy films, I just enjoy good movies and, to my surprise, Fellowship was a pretty good one.  In my eyes it was flawed no doubt; me not being versed in fantasy stories, much less Tolkien's books, there were some aspects of the story/characters that I didn't particularly like.  But hey, that's my bias I guess.  Nevertheless it was a very good film and I was actually anticipating its sequel, The Two Towers.Like almost all sequels, The Two Towers is a victim of the sophomore jinx. I wasn't as moved with Two Towers as I was with Fellowship.  The battle scene was good, and the landscapes as expected were spectacular.  But the story truly lagged at some parts.  The whole business with the tree people' was pretty boring; although in the end we finally see what their purpose to the big scheme of things is.  What was also annoying was how hard it was to understand what most of the characters were saying.I found myself rewinding many times to try and make out what was being said.  What was pretty surprising was how little we see of the hobbits, who are at the crux of the story.   The Two Towers attempts to move at the same pace that the Fellowship moved at, but ultimately fails to do so.  So many new characters were introduced to the point where you just lose track and cease to care about what is going on.  So much was crammed into this film without much background.  Fellowship kept you interested throughout, even through much dialogue and so-called slow spots'.  The story of The Two Towers, however, lacks the same punch that Fellowship had, and simply lags at some parts.  With all this said, this is the 2nd in a trilogy, so I can only hope that the final installment brings everything together to make the whole LOTR experience memorable.One more thingI am surprised that these two films are rated so high here at IMDB (LOTR 1 at #6; LOTR 2 at #10)????  They are good films, but to be rated in the top 10 along with undeniable masterpieces like Godfather I/II, Shawshank Redemption & Casablanca I feel is a travesty!!  To the biggest fan of these types of movies/stories, could they really put this aside The Godfather, Usual Suspects, Memento or Casablanca and HONESTLY say that it ranks equally with any of those films?  NO WAY!!  I see nothing in these films that make them as groundbreaking' as the ones listed.  Aside from the CGI eye candy what really is there to hold on to, like the marvelous ACTING in the films listed above?  Will LOTR really be remembered 20 years from now as timeless classics like those?  For the hype and monetary aspects, maybe..but for the actual movies, I doubt it very much.  I really feel the hoopla around the LOTR franchise is undeserved and exaggerated.The Matrix remains the only trilogy that hasn't disappointed, and for all of its groundbreaking leaps it still doesn't get the respect and recognition it truly deserves.",6,1,2,26 August 2003
Hero," Beautiful film
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!After hearing how great this film did in China, being that I'm a big fan of kung fu films, i felt drawn to this film.  I even went to the website to see the trailer, and I was impressed...besides, Jet Li and Donnie Yen were in it.  So, I purchased the DVD online, scared that when it finally came over to the States (in November 2003 i read) that they were going to butcher the film beyond recognition. I just finished watching this film, and I must say that I am kinda mixed on it.  The cinematography is simply brilliant....one of the best visual pieces I've ever seen.  With that said, this alone doesn't make a film. As far as the story, I was drawn into it, and was glad that the filmmakers attempted to have a deeper meaning.  I found that the kung fu complimented the storyline perfectly.  I was never a fan of wire-fu, but I can deal with it once I know that the film on a whole is of that surreal, folklore nature. While this would no doubt get compared to Crouching Tiger, Hero is a totally different film, and I find it a better film because it is more engaging overall.  The problem i had with CTHD was the whole near hour-long diversion into the love story with Zhang Ziyi(sp?), that killed the momentum for me.  Although that film rounded out nicely, I feel that Hero keeps you into the story the whole time.  I will admit that I was still a bit thrown off by the moral attempts this film made...but I appreciated it nonetheless. At first I was disappointed by the end of the film; I was left a bit empty. I'm assuming that the king killed Nameless in the end...why didn't he try to escape?  Why did the King still kill Nameless after he spared his life? Just WHO is THE 'hero' in the film?  Does there have to be only one?  Just the fact that I came out of this film thinking makes this film a very good one.  It is always refreshing to have food for thought in movies nowadays.A few disappointments I had:  Donnie Yen wasn't on screen long enough (he was recovering correct?  so he's the only survivor I'm assuming). Also, there was not enough character development...we're just fed everything rather than being shown the history of the characters.  why were Broken Sword and Snow so eager to fight each other without second thought? weren't they lovers??  i found that a little weird. With all the hype surrounding the film, in hindsight I was bound to be disappointed somehow.  Nevertheless this is one of the better films to come out in a good while, I was very impressed with it.  I encourage people on the West to purchase this film now and get the film how it is meant to be shown...as it is likely it will be cut and cheapened for American audiences. Highly recommended.",Null,0,0,29 April 2003
Million Dollar Baby," Just when I thought Mystic River couldn't be topped
","I just saw Million Dollar Baby about 2 hours ago, and I'll admit that I was a bit non-decided on how much I liked the film; there's no doubt that I liked it. I've always admired Clint Eastwood's style and choice of films to make, his films are so human at the core and that's something that's sorely missed. Every time I see that Eastwood has directed a film, I am eager to watch it. The stories he chooses and the characters he shows are the essence of human everyday life; and as a result I can FEEL his films that much more. This time around, however, the simplicity and realness of the story was SO MUCH that I was almost numb after wards. Unlike Mystic River, which was more in-your-face, raw emotion that could be immediately recognized; Million Dollar Baby is so much more reserved, almost passive in telling its tale that all of its influence can't be initially taken in. Million Dollar Baby is so 'bare-boned' it's almost scary to look at. It's so subtle that I didn't recognize the true beauty of it until further contemplation as I was leaving the theater.Because of this, I can honestly say that Clint has truly mastered film-making (in his own way of course). This, to me, represents Eastwood's pinnacle; THE blueprint for an Eastwood film in the truest sense. The beauty and genius of MDB is that everything is not spoon-fed to the audience. For example, we never find out why Clint's (Frankie) daughter doesn't want anything to do with him. Then again, it doesn't really matter. I think of it as a 'longer-lasting McGuffin'. We just know that Frankie's life has forever changed because of his estranged relationship, and everything he does is a result of it. Nothing is really forced on us; which is perfectly represented by Freeman's narration, which is simply a guide with no influencing tone throughout. It's a classic story told in the simplest of fashions; we have just been fortunate enough to 'drop in', if you will, on the lives of these three people. This has become a signature of Eastwood's films.sure it could be said to be present in other films, but no one captures that effect the way Clint does.I don't really have to say it now, but the acting is truly first class. Eastwood is as good as he's ever been as Frankie, you can't help but genuinely FEEL his character. The same could be said for Morgan Freeman, who is one of the greatest actors ever. For a man with such a commanding presence on the screen, Freeman underplays his character perfectly. Swank as Maggie is just wonderful. I could see the dedication that she put into the character; it was a sight to see. As said before, the story (a surprisingly dark one) is classic; but it's told in a way that doesn't come off as preachy or overly sappy. Frankie has lost much in his life; he's a grieving old man who is trying to hold onto whatever he can but it always finds a way to wiggle out of his grasp. He had just about given up when Maggie came along and he reluctantly gets attached again. He goes through it all with Maggie and learns to love again; when again it was being taken away from him. Only this time, he wasn't going to stand around and let it wiggle out of his hand.this time he set it down and let it go.on HIS terms. He may not have wanted to let go and be hurt once again, but the strength he showed displayed the love he had; love that would never die. He had learned that he could indeed love again, and it was there until the very end. Scrap had it all at one point, but after losing his eye in a title fight his dream was deferred. He'd gotten the title fight he'd always wanted and let it all out. but at a price. He has since been reduced to a help man at the local boxing gym, a life that he seems to accept because that's about as useful as he's going to be. He is best friends with Frankie, about the only one that Frankie truly has; but even their relationship has an uneasiness to it.they exist now almost as a father/son tandem, most likely to make up for what Frankie views as his mistake for not protecting Scrap's well-being many years ago. Maggie was a nobody who just wanted a chance at life and eventually got it. The simplicity of her story is the beauty of it; and it is also the reason you can come to terms with her decision that much easier at the end of the film, no matter how coarse and sorrowful it seems. She got her chance, lived the life she wanted to live; she had her family (now Frankie); and that's all she ever wanted.Million Dollar Baby is such a beautiful, simple story with so many layers; that's why it works so well. It may take more than one viewing to realize completely the essence of the film. If any lesson is learned here it's 'simple is better'. Eastwood takes that to heart with all of his films, and that philosophy has been fully mastered and realized by him; putting him in the upper echelon of the greatest filmmakers in movie history. Just when we thought Mystic River couldn't be topped, we are blessed with 'an old master's new masterpiece'.I couldn't put it better. I can only imagine what Eastwood will come with next, but this gem is one for the ages.**** out of **** stars.",9,3,5,4 March 2005
The Piano," One of the worst movies I've ever seen!
","***SPOILERS BELOW***Wow.  To think that The Piano was nominated for 8 Oscars in '94 and won 3 (2 of them big ones) I expected so much more from this movie.  Quite frankly, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  Holly Hunter won a Best Actress Oscar for this role?  WHY??  She didn't say a word throughout the entire film (except for voice overs at the beginning and end), and does nothing but look sad and withdrawn the whole time.  The first thing I did after seeing this was look at the list of nominees/winners in '94, and saw who SHOULD HAVE won the Best Actress Oscar that year.Angela Bassett!!  Anna Paquin won Best Supporting Actress.... why?  She was good but not THAT good. Campion winning for Best Screenplay?  The script' was horrible!  It must've been a pretty bad year in Hollywood for this trash to be nominated for so many awards and win 2 big ones.  In no way do I live & swear by popcorn movies', but this was just dreadful.  Anyway, onto the film'.I now know Jane Campion's M.O.  After seeing the AWFUL In The Cut' last year, The Piano surprisingly has the same inadequacies & fetishes as 'In The Cut' did.  It gives NOTHING of a story; nothing is developed...we're just thrown into these weird occurrences and frankly don't give a damn about anyone.  A mute girl is arranged to marry some guy who lives in the woods somewhere, wants nothing to do with him, is forced to teach his friend, George Baines the piano, who is a perverted sicko (Keitel).... after numerous crude passes and sexual harassment by George, suddenly the feeling is mutual for her, her husband' (Sam Neill) finds out about the affair, cuts off one of her fingers, then finally allows her to leave with George his former friend, who takes care of her.  This is the plot'.  From here, now we're supposed to read into the oh-so-subtle' images that the piano is her voice' (pretty obvious) and, from reading other people's reviews, she's exploring; taking control of, if you will, her sexual qualities due to the suppression of them by society at this time (19th century).  Well, I'm sorry, but I did not get that from the movie.  Tell me:  how was she in control?  She's forced to teach George piano lessons, who only uses these sessions' as an opportunity to fondle, flirt and grope her every chance he gets.  From the looks of things, she's not at all happy with what's happening.  But she does them only to buy' her piano back, which she loves so dearly and is her voice' (I got that).  But it's George that's in control there.  The husband?  I don't know what his story was, because he was the most neglectful spouse he could've possibly been.  What was he supposed to do, rape her?  It was obvious she didn't want him.  So, she doesn't like her husband, wants nothing to do with him, and then suddenly falls for George, who was only degrading & offensive to her the whole time? How did that happen?  WHEN did that happen?  He shows her a little guilt and she switches her feelings?  Was it that easy???  There was NO evidence of her EVER enjoying what he was doing....but then all of a sudden she's in love with him??  SPARE ME!!  Meanwhile the husband sees her committing adultery when it first happens, but doesn't do/say anything until Flora, her DAUGHTER of all people (Anna Paquin) rats on her to him (when Ada goes back to George after being told to stay away).  WHY did Flora do this?  See, this is where we needed to see previous evidence of animosity by the daughter towards her mother (enough at least to warrant this)...but there's nothing of the sort.  I guess Campion wants us to just write this off as pure ignorance/innocence by Flora, always wanting to do right even if it means getting her own mother in trouble.  Give me a break....that act definitely looked malicious to me.  But again, why was this the case when she was truly Ada's only real companion...her DAUGHTER for crying out loud!?!?!  Anyway he finally grows some 'cojones' and punishes her by cutting off one of her fingers with an axe...he must be really good with an axe to only cut off one finger!  LOL please!  It's here in which we get a really bad acting job by Holly Hunter.  I understand she can't scream but come on!  Simply kneeling down on the ground just didn't convince me...I thought she was Supergirl for a second there, she didn't even wince!  Her whole performance was emotionless and dry....I felt NOTHING for her.  The only time I sat up in my seat was when she apparently tries to drown herself; I was practically laughing thinking to myself, yea, kill yourself so this trash could end'. At NO POINT in the film did I feel she was in control of things, except her lame & minimal attempts at showing affection to her husband by rubbing his body, in which he then trusted her again not to see George and remove the barricades from the windows.  Some control she had with her hand was on the chopping block!  I've seen a pattern with Jane Campion.  She just throws things together and puts you in a place with no background or character/story development (we hardly know where they are!!!), tries to make it artsy and throws a woman in there to try and make a point about her sexuality and sexual self-realization..that's probably her own stance on the issue.  If that's what The Piano was about, I shouldn't have to ASSUME it.  That's the main problem with this movie; it doesn't give the audience anything to take in and appreciate.  It doesn't present anything..it only throws them into a situation, a weird & somewhat illogical one at that, and expects them to buy into it.  I'm sorry, but I have to know where she's from, WHERE SHE IS, why/how she became, either by choice or not, mute (its very hard to believe the daughter's story), what her past relationships with men were like, why she didn't like her assigned husband, why/how/when she falls in love with the sadistic George, why her daughter (her only confidant) rats on her to her husband', etc etc.  The story is extremely weak and fails to explain anything.  One would probably say a film like Memento was artsy' too, but at least Christopher Nolan gave us something of a STORY there.  The fact that this was praised and rewarded as much as it was is a travesty in my opinion.  This was one big waste of time that I will only remember as one of the worst movies I've ever seen.it offers absolutely NOTHING!  And that's the grade I give it...ZERO out of **** stars.",1,79,157,26 January 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," VERY Entertaining!
","The 4th film by Quentin Tarantino, Kill Bill....what can I say?  I'm a big fan of Tarantino, and I don't have to explain how anticipated his next film was.  One thing about QT that I can always appreciate is how different he is when it comes to subject matter, style, etc etc.  Kill Bill is probably the most straight-forward piece he's done to date.  The signature styles and techniques of QT are here as well, and he employed some new ones also. Quite frankly, Kill Bill is a damn good movie.  I want to hold off on deeming it a classic until I see the whole thing.  But from what I've seen so far, its a film that will set new boundaries in cinema....the way his other films did. I'm not a huge fan of Uma Thurman, I thought she was pretty good in Pulp Fiction, but she's VERY good here...I didn't expect her to be as convincing as she was.  Being a HUGE fan of kung fu movies (particularly from the 70s-80s), I loved the casting of Gordon Liu....although I would've liked his showdown to be a little longer. Bruce Lee's yellow jumpsuit as worn in 'Game of Death'....very nice homage to the master.  I'm not at all a fan of Lucy Liu, but suprisingly her casting here is not half bad.  Vivica Fox on the other hand.....is only here for style, she didn't serve much purpose at all. The story of Kill Bill, one of revenge, is straight forward but very intriguing.  The way QT presents the film, its almost like he thought of every possible technique/style he could think of and used it in Kill Bill. Things like the B&W sequence and the Japanimation sequence add a whole new twist to the film and is VERY creative...it works perfectly. 
I didn't like the fact that they cut the film into two parts, but I can't wait to see the second part.  Vol. 1 is a little short; nevertheless they cut the film at a good place, setting up the second part very well.  A VERY entertaining film, QT has done it again.  This is shaping out to be a milestone in filmmaking, hell it probably is already.  Vol. 2 will only cement Kill Bill's place in cinema history.  A truly monumental film. Bravo, QT, bravo!*** 3/4 out of **** stars.",9,2,5,24 October 2003
Saw," One of the more shocking, disturbing films I've seen in a long time.one of the best of the year.
","**WARNING! POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW!!**I was anticipating this film ever since I first saw the poster. When I saw the trailer I anticipated it even more. I'm a BIG fan of psychological thrillers (anyone expecting this to be, or saying this is a horror film is wrong), and I was certain that this would be on the level of some of the classic thrillers of this kind; i.e. Se7en, Silence of the Lambs, etc. After seeing it I must say that it met my expectations and is one of the best films I've seen this year. I honestly left the theater with my mouth dropped, it was an exhausting and exhilarating feeling at the same time.but it was a GREAT feeling. I don't think I've seen a movie begin and end the way 'Saw' did, it jumps RIGHT into the action and right back out of it. And as far as the ending: absolutely genius. No one could honestly say that they predicted that the killer was who it ends up being in the end. I've read other reviews criticizing the end, saying 'why would he lay there for 8 hours' who cares?!?! What's baffling and mind-boggling is that he DID! I love how everything was done.the movie was smart and nail-biting, it gave me the feeling that the aforementioned thriller classics did; but what it also did was make its own mark on the whole genre. The only thing preventing 'Saw' from getting a perfect score is the ASININE actions (or lack thereof) of Cary Elwes' wife after getting the upper-hand over the guy holding her hostage. Why in the HELL didn't she shoot him once she got the gun from him? That was so ANNOYING to watch, it almost ruined the movie for a second. All in all, 'Saw' is truly a great, great film that I will HAVE to own when it's released on DVD. A classic thriller film, it's nice to see that people can still make good thrillers nowadays.*** ½ out of **** stars.",9,0,0,5 December 2004
The Last Samurai," The Last Samurai  one of the best films of the year
","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW!!***Seeing all the previews for this film, I repeatedly told myself `Last Samurai? TOM CRUISE???  No way!  That's gonna be so BAD!!  What is Hollywood coming to??'  After seeing it earlier tonight, Ill just saydon't be fooled. All of the praise and Oscar buzz this movie's been receiving is justified. This is a powerful, moving, engaging movie.  I was very impressed.  Tom Cruise is great in his role as Nathan Algren; he's a hit or miss with me, but he was wonderful.I'd even give him an Oscar nomination.  His performance is his best in a long time.  The person who absolutely stole the show, however, is Ken Watanabe as the last samurai', Katsumoto. He definitely should get an Oscar nod for his charismatic, poised, and extremely convincing portrayal of the rebel samurai.  He was absolutely wonderful.  The story of The Last Samurai is a human one at its core.  The many layers of the story all connect to the human element, and this is the beauty of the film.  I thought Tom Cruise was very convincing as Nathan Algren as he transformed from the drunken, arrogant yet tortured Civil War hero'..to the morally born-again, self-realized, humbled warrior, whose initially reluctant exposure to the culture he must help extinguish, helps him broaden his horizons and grow as a man and ultimately a soldier.  He falls in love with the culture that he and his culture deemed as savage and uncivilized. It's a beautiful story.The way the Samurai are portrayed is the arguably the most realistic and believable I've seen in a movie.  I was very intrigued to learn more about the culture and the way of the Samurai warrior.  I'd have liked the makers to go deeper into this with more detail, particularly on the fighting techniques and philosophies, but it was intriguing nonetheless.  The appearance of the ninja was a pleasant surprise and VERY exciting. 
My only gripe with the movie is that I felt that Nathan Algren should've died at the end.  It just didn't seem very feasible that he lived, seeing that he was the enemy now and they'd already started the job by shooting him several times during the Samurai's last stand.  Why didn't they finish him off?  Because he's an American?  He didn't seem like one when he showed up with the enemy with every intention of betraying and fighting against them!! The US Colonel himself said that he'd be treated like one of them' if he indeed betrayed them, which he did.  I found that to be a little unbelievable.  Then again, who else could've given the Emperor Katsumoto's sword?  There are plenty of names one could throw out easily, but it wouldn't have had the same impact that Tom Cruise had.  In my opinion, if Tom Cruise died, it would not only have been better for the overall impact of the film (note the deaths of Mel Gibson in Braveheart, Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan and Russell Crowe in Gladiator) but also better for the story; the reign of the Samurai does indeed end, they are slaughtered; the fact that he is the lone survivor is kinda lame.I'm sure the reason' is only because he was American.  But under those circumstances there is no way Cruise would've been spared.After Mystic River, The Last Samurai is one of the best films I've seen this year.  It's an epic that doesn't depend on being sappy and melodramatic. The gritty, treacherous tone of the film stays constant throughout, and you're forced to be intrigued throughout.  Sure the battle scenes (which were very well done) reminds us of Braveheart, but they're as exciting and moving as I've seen.  One can always question the historical accuracy of films like this, and The Last Samurai is not immune to those questions.  The cinematography was excellent, with the beautiful backdrops of Japan serving as the perfect canvas for the emotional and spiritual story laid before it. The acting is first-class and the story is rivetingwhat else can anyone ask for in a movie?  With all of the garbage being released by Hollywood, it's nice to see a movie that doesn't depend on CGI and silly gimmicks to get their point across.  I was surprised at how good this was; it was executed very well and I congratulate the makers of The Last Samurai for their great work.  I hope this film is recognized at the Oscars, particularly Ken Watanabehis performance, to me, is unforgettable.***1/2 out of **** stars.",9,0,0,8 December 2003
Eyes Wide Shut," A triumphant end to a BRILLIANT career
","I am a BIG fan of Stanley Kubrick, and it's a shame that we won't be able to witness another Kubrick film.  What he contributed to film could hardly be put into words; he was simply a genius.  His name is right up there with Hitchcock and Scorcese as far as milestone directors who revolutionized film.  Kubrick's last film, Eyes Wide Shut', is a suitable and triumphant end to his illustrious career; it is misunderstood, quite ambiguous, controversial and different from anything you'd see.The usual Kubrick signatures are present, the dream-like long shots, beautiful frames, and a steady, sometimes slow pace.  Eyes Wide Shut' is a film-buff's movie.  This obviously is in no way for the audience of Armageddon',  XXX' or Charlie's Angels'it is a thinker's movie, as is all of Kubrick's films.  Because of this, Eyes Wide Shut' will turn off many people, even some Kubrick fans.  In a simple description, this movie is a character study.  Everyone of my peers hated this movie, all I heard was it was boring', what is it about?', the movie sucked'.  What strikes me about this movie is the fact that it is very different, almost dream-like throughout, but I for one was intrigued from beginning to end.  Tom Cruise was excellent in his role; he really showed that he could downright act in this film and should've gotten more recognition for his role.  Although I don't like Nicole Kidman, she was very effective in this as well.  The true star of this movie is, of course, Kubrick.  Simply put, this is a beautiful film to watch.  This is true with all of his movies, and he doesn't disappoint here.  The story explores humans and their sexual nature..it explores human relationships..simple!  Whether what we see is a dream or not, in the end, doesn't really matter to me.  The way Kubrick explores the human psyche in his films made him that much more unique, and he stripped everything down to the bare essence in EWS and said, this is how we are, like it or not, LOOK'.  Whether or not you choose to do so is up to you.  I think this movie is meant to be unsettling, everything you see is there for that purpose.  This is a very mature film, which is why I think there's such a diverse opinion about it.  It's sad we won't get anymore Kubrick films, but this is a wonderful and suitable end to a wonderful career.  The last testament of Kubrick's genius, in my opinion, is a great one.*** 1/2 out of **** stars",Null,0,1,25 August 2003
Titanic," VERY OVERRATED!!!!
","SPOILERS INCLUDED...Although I made a vow to myself to NEVER see this movie, my girlfriend begged me to rent it and sit through it with her.  So, very reluctantly, I did.  And let me just say, Titanic was everything I expected.  Titanic is nothing but an overly sappy, unrealistic, historically incorrect, drawn out, trashy film.  With all the hype this film received, after seeing it I expected to see Titanic on IMDB's Top 250 list...but it's not!  WHEW!! Good, because it doesn't deserve to be.  My God, WHAT WAS THE HYPE ABOUT?? Why was this movie 3 hours and 14 minutes?  That alone is a BIG flaw of this film because we all know what's going to happen in the end.... why let the audience wait 2.5 hours to see the inevitable?  This movie could've been cropped to 2.5 easily...which still maybe would've been too long.  The corny love story was just horrible.  The language used, especially by DiCaprio's character, was totally unbelievable and unconvincing....we're supposed to be in 1912, remember??  Kate Winslet came off as an annoying little brat....DiCaprio was barely tolerable.  Another thing that turned me off to the film was the story.  How could people embrace this film so much in its account of the Titanic experience... and the story is fictional?  We're supposed to take Cameron's word for it? Please!  The love story, along with the overall script he wrote was SICKENING.  The only good part of the film is when the boat starts to sink....that's the only part of the film that really matters.   
Now my major gripe with the film:  What was the deal with Rose taking up the whole door???  LOL.  Did you all see how big that door was???  You mean to tell me that Jack couldn't fit on the door with her?  She claimed she loved Jack...even went back to save him while he was chained to the pipe in that room that was flooding.  If that was the case why couldn't she make room for him to get up on the door with her instead of freezing to death in the Atlantic?? I'm curious whether anyone else has wondered that....The scene i mentioned above embodies my feelings about Titanic.  It seems Cameron just wanted to get some Oscars, so he put the formula together to do so.  Get Celine Dion to sing da song, the sappy score, put Leo in there so all da little girls would go see it and feel sorry for him, have a HUGE budget, use lots of CGI and make it a 3+ hour film (so it could be an epic of course).  it all comes across as CHEAP!  He was trying too hard to appeal to everyone...it has the sappy emotional, 'boo-hoo' aspect for the ladies and the graphic action-packed death sequences for the guys.  In the end we have 3 hours of confusion and essentially pointless narrative.  I finally sat through this film and, like I knew it would, it justified my initial thoughts of it when it first released in '97.  Corny, horrible story, and completely overdone.  Bottom line, this movie sucked, and has to be the most overrated film I've seen in a LONG, long time, maybe ever.  *1/2 out of ****.",4,2,3,5 August 2003
In Time," Great premise, failed to deliver...
","From the first time I saw the trailer I was intrigued. Seemed like a new twist on things; GREAT premise. That was until I saw Justin Timberlake as the lead actor. Immediate doubt. The end result was the letdown I expected; maybe a bit more. Timberlake is tolerable in this, just not the best choice in my opinion. Quite frankly, the makers of this movie somehow failed to capitalize on a wonderful opportunity. As an example, I felt it was a much more harrowing experience witnessing the powers that be ridding society of emotion in the movie 'Equilibrium' than the dilemma of having enough time in 'In Time'. I felt nothing for anyone in this film. They just skimmed over the very real and supposedly horrible fact that everyday people were dying simply because they didn't have the means (wealth) to afford more of it...so much so that I couldn't feel anything for anyone. Even the scene with the mother and the bus, which was supposed to be a heart-wrenching scene, had little effect.I'm more amazed at the failure to really nail this concept home than anything else. The makers really had a chance to do something special. In the end, 'In Time' was just another sci-fi flick that implied its desire to separate itself from the pack, but in the end made no effort to do so. Could've been so much more....3/10 - for the concept alone",3,0,4,24 December 2011
The Matrix Reloaded," WONDERFUL Sequel! A classic!!!
","**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**Matrix Reloaded is a VERY worthy sequel.  I was expecting to be disappointed with this film, as the original set so many boundaries and exceeded all expectations....its  a classic film.  The reason why I wasn't disappointed with Reloaded is because everything I expected this film to do actually happened.  The love story between Trinity and Neo was explored more, the real meaning behind the Matrix was explored more. I expected all of these things, so I knew what to expect.  Everything that they SHOULD HAVE DONE they did, and did it flawlessly.  This film is nothing short of brilliant. 
The `eye candy', as expected was simply astonishing.  Seeing that films nowadays copy the special effects from the original, the bullet-time and other FX didn't seem overused.  It's only right that The Matrix expand on this technology and use it how its supposed to be used.  When I heard that this film tried to be too deep in their dialogue, after seeing the film I'm still curious as to what these people/critics were talking about.  I gathered enough information to get the gist of the film and its story...of course I would have to see it again to get every last detail, but there was nothing confusing about this movie or dialogue.  Everything about it was beautiful.  Also, the makers got rid of my only fear concerning this film very quickly.....this movie is non-stop ACTION!  They hardly let up on the action sequences...and it was very well balanced.  The highway sequence was so entertainingit could easily take the cake as the best action sequence of the film.  The fight scenes were just amazing as expected...especially the ones with Neo.  The new characters were simply awesomethe ghosts' as I call them were just mind-boggling to watch.  When I heard the makers of the movie say that this was unlike anything we've seen before....I didn't believe them.  But after seeing the film, they were so right!  The only period of the film that I feel could've been gotten rid of was, what I dubbed, the MTV sequence'when the people of Zion were dancing after Morpheus' speech of hope against the machines.  Other than that this film doesn't skip a beat.I was expecting to be disappointed by Matrix Reloaded, but I wasn't.which is why this film is an instant classic to me.  I can't wait to see the film again, because the Matrix franchise is one of the very few films out there that continues to satisfy me, and it's very refreshing to experience.  If you haven't seen this film yet, go out and watch it NOW!  Don't listen to the critics about this film being too deep' or too hard to follow'.  Go and experience it for yourself, and I guarantee that you won't be disappointed.  My rating, 10/10just like the originalthey haven't lost a step.and seeing how the first 2 are I doubt that they will with the 3rd installment.  Questions I have:  Who was the survivor laying aside Neo in the end? Is the real world' really the Matrix as well?",10,0,0,17 May 2003
Mystic River," Reminds me of how films used to be....
","**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**We need more films like Mystic River.  Nowadays, when Hollywood is full of mindless, popcorn movies, Clint Eastwood takes us back to when good stories and great acting was the blueprint of a good movie.  I love Clint Eastwood for his 'human' films; note some of his past works such as Unforgiven, Blood Work & Absolute Power.  He always gives his audience a humble, down-to-Earth film when he directs.  Mystic River works because of this quality more than anything.  Unlike someone like Michael Bay (notably Bad Boys 2), he doesn't get too full of himself where he has to pour himself, his 'style' and his 'signature' into a movie.  He steps back and simply tells a human story; and the beauty of that is a sight to behold and greatly appreciated by me.The acting in Mystic River drives it.  An all-star cast to say the least, Sean Penn gives a masterful performance; balancing the two sides of his character flawlessly.  On one side is the former criminal who still has some ties to his past, and on the other is the honorable father who would do anything for family.  Tim Robbins was cast perfectly as the trouble Dave; only he could've given the little nuances he did to add so much to the character, like his facial expressions.  Kevin Bacon, who I neither love or hate, played his part very well; subtle enough to portray the hard-nosed cop and grieving soon-to-be divorcee perfectly.  Laurence Fishburne, although its always nice to see him, didn't really need to be here; anyone could've played his role.  Oscar talk has surfaced, and rightfully so; Sean Penn definitely has my vote for Best Actor.  Tim Robbins could very well win Best Supporting Actor, he was excellent.  Mystic River is great because of the statement it gives... taking us back to the days of films like The Godfather, Apocalypse Now and Goodfellas.  It serves as a reminder to us skeptics that there still is great talent out there regardless of the overabundance of garbage put out constantly.  A good movie can indeed be made without CGI, explosions and slo-mo gun battles....just great actors and a riveting story.  THIS is why the critics have raved about Mystic River; its a good old-fashioned 'movie' without all the extras.  Mystic River is a masterpiece in my eyes, and I would be highly disappointed if it's not recognized at the Oscars, particularly Sean Penn. One of the best films of 2003.*** 1/2 out of **** stars.",10,1,3,4 November 2003
Man on Fire," One of the best this year....Denzel & Dakota are excellent!
","**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**This was a great movie, with first class acting and riveting direction from Tony Scott.  Denzel's character (Creasy) in Man On Fire makes Alonzo Harris (Training Day) look like a boy scout.  He was as convincing as ever, you couldn't help but feel for Creasy....that drunken scene in his room when he was trying to catch the bullet was wonderful. Dakota Fanning was excellent....we should be seeing her for a long time, what a talent!  The story type has been done before, but rarely is it done with such style and conviction.  The length could've been 15 mins shorter, but it didn't hurt the film.  Christopher Walken was as good as always.  I just loved all the cutting and jerky kind of style, it set the mood flawlessly.  Another thing that stood out were the subtitles, I don't think I've EVER seen them done that way before....shown on screen AS the dialogue is spoken.  Ingenious. Great riveting action throughout, with nice twists to the story.  One of the best films this year.***1/2 out of **** stars",8,0,0,14 May 2004
American Gangster," One of the best films of the year; although not groundbreaking for its genre.
","It's pretty interesting hearing the overall consensus on American Gangster. Either you love it or hate it. I don't know how it can be so clear cut but whatever. American Gangster is a very well executed film; the acting and directing is first-class. The hype around this film ultimately hurt it however, it was really billed as a 'modern day Godfather'. I doubt very highly that that was the aim of the movie makers here.American Gangster is nothing like that. Nothing new is done here as far as the crime genre is concerned, it's just so BRILLIANT in its execution.Acting If there was any doubt as to Denzel's acting ability and prowess, there shouldn't be after his performance here. Hell, there shouldn't have been any doubt after Malcolm X, and that was 15 years ago! He and Morgan Freeman have a similar presence on screen; he is simply a master and commands respect and attention. There's nothing else for me to say about him, he carried the film. Russell Crowe was very good as well. His character's story is not liked very much, but I for one liked his story. From his character dealing with corruption to the issues with his wife; I liked seeing not only Frank Lucas come up in the drug world, but Richie Roberts (Crowe) come up in the 'cop world'. Crowe's character added a good balance to Denzel's powerful performance; and I felt the two sides of the story came together very nicely. As far as the supporting cast, Ruby Dee..not exactly a role that really pushed her to the limits, but she hit it on the head with great subtlety. Arguably the best supporting actor in the film, in my eyes, was RZA. He really showed that he's dedicated to making it in the movie industry in more ways than one (movie scoring & acting); and he REALLY came through here. It was ironic seeing him play a cop, but he did it very well.his 'junkie' scene near the end was classic. T.I. & Common were decent as well, but they really didn't have much to do; RZA had the biggest role out of all of them, and out-shined them all. I'm not a fan of Cuba Gooding Jr., and I must admit I was surprised seeing him here, but he was good as Nicky Barnes. His one (well, only) scene with Denzel was a sight to see; it's a great scene; right up there with Denzel & Crowe in the end. Armand Assante was a welcomed sight as the Don, I've always liked him as a character actor, and he does mob guys flawlessly. Josh Brolin was wonderful as the corrupt detective; he was as creepy as Matt Dillon in 'Crash'.Direction You can see Ridley Scott's influence throughout this movie. There's such a sense of control, pace and outright direction throughout. From the set pieces to the camera shots and how the story is presented, there's a very mature look and feel to the movie. This is one of the classier crime films, reminiscent of Michael Mann's touch in 'Heat'. There's still a grittiness to it, which again is telling of Scott's direction.Story With the public being bombarded with the 'real story' behind Frank Lucas on various documentaries on television in the days and weeks leading up to the film's release, this also hurt the film. There are reports that Lucas himself said that the film is 60% accurate, and if you saw the documentaries on Lucas before seeing this film, naturally you would be disappointed somewhat, because everything wouldn't add up. I am fortunate that I didn't see all of the extra features on television, no doubt done to further hype the movie which it REALLY didn't need. People have to remember that this is BASED on a true story. This is a movie, NOT a documentary. The more people realize that, the better.Hype The hype machine for American Gangster was too much in my opinion; and ultimately took away from the film. I will admit that I came away with slight disappointment when the end credits started rolling. There was such a craze and hype surrounding the film that you couldn't help but expect a 'next Godfather/Goodfellas/Casino/Scarface' type of filma cult classic of sorts that's so grand in stature that you had no doubt that it would indeed be an addition to that list of genre-defining, pioneering gangster films that we all love. It falls short of that, which is why feeling a little disappointment afterwards is almost inevitable. There is nothing new here; nothing innovative, nothing genre-defining (or RE-defining for that matter). No 'extremely realistic shootout scene' as featured in 'Heat', or 'quotable-laden, cocaine filled shootouts' as featured in 'Scarface'. No characters as memorable and legendary as featured in 'Godfather', 'Scarface' or 'Goodfellas'. Denzel's Frank Lucas comes damn close (because he's THAT good), but I don't think it quite reaches that status. There is nothing in American Gangster that REALLY stands out in that way.I would say, however, that as far as black gangster films go, it may very well be THE best ever made to date. With its sheer brilliance in its execution, acting, directing, storytelling, maturity and class; I could say with confidence that it is. And that, in and of itself, makes it one of the best movies of the year hands down (I see at least 3 Oscar noms here), if not one of the best of the new millennium.8.5/10",9,1,7,4 November 2007
Vanilla Sky," One..........Big..........MESS!!!!
","I first went to the theater to see this with my girlfriend....needless to say I fell asleep half way through...she somehow stayed awake through the whole thing and we both immediately wrote it off as a horrible film.  It just showed on HBO and I finally decided to sit through it and actually watch it this time, and my opinion hasn't changed.  As another reviewer put it, Vanilla Sky tries TOO HARD to be clever.  I got the gist of the film from the first 20 minutes and the last 15 minutes.  That's all I needed. Everything else in between is useless.  I read all the people talkin about this movie, saying that whoever doesnt like this movie don't like to think and 'don't know anything about movies', and so on and so forth. Okay..... its one thing to try and bring a story with deep meaning and insight into film....but its another thing to cram a bunch of philosophical, sci-fi babble into a film and pass if off as 'clever' and 'imaginative'.  That's exactly what Crowe does with Vanilla Sky.  Amazingly, in trying to do all of that it STILL finds a way to come off as boring.  Now I get the whole thing about getting a second chance at life, and finding happiness and true love and such...but CMON!Experiencing Vanilla Sky is like me asking someone to do a puzzle while I slowly drop its pieces onto the canvas as the person tries putting it together....only to then bring the person the puzzle almost put together with a few pieces still missing.  It's all a big MESS!  I see what they were trying to do with the story, but they couldn't present it better than this???  A bunch of ill conceived, drawn out, disjointed sequences that has no irrelevance, to the point where the story itself is lost??  Vanilla Sky represents a cop out in filmmaking, its that simple.  'Lets just confuse the HELL out of them for 2 hours and in the last 20 minutes just explain everything that just happened'.  What's the point?  It's all a waste of time.  The only thing that matters by the end of the movie is, as I said, everything up until the car crash and the last 15 minutes on the roof. The story was executed SO POORLY, that anything other than those two parts is just an excuse to drag the story along.  This movie was TERRIBLY executed. It could've been so much better if it was organized and constructed better.*1/2 out of **** stars",3,1,2,11 December 2003
The Dark Knight Rises," The best trilogy of all time. Thank You, Mr. Nolan.
","After finally watching what was my most anticipated movie ever, I'm full of mixed emotions. I'm sad that the journey is over, but also overjoyed by what I saw. Although a small step below the sheer excitement and astonishment that I felt walking out of The Dark Knight, I feel completely fulfilled. And for that, I am EXTREMELY thankful. I feel absolutely privileged to have witnessed Nolan's vision of Batman. Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think I would see my favorite comic character realized with such thought, care and maturity. I feel forever indebted to Christopher Nolan for doing Batman ultimate justice. This film and the trilogy overall was masterfully done. With Dark Knight Rises, everything comes together wonderfully. With a host of new characters added, it never felt overwhelming. The core themes are fully fleshed out and the villain this time around is simply terrifying. A couple things seemed a bit rushed; I would've liked to have seen more of Bane (back story, more explanation of his mask), as well as more stuff regarding Bruce Wayne and his love interest. The length of the film didn't bother me one bit, but the pacing in the first 45 minutes could've been slightly better. Thankfully these minor issues do not take away from the overall experience.Now to the performances. Tom Hardy as Bane was absolutely amazing! Nolan took quite a risk having the main villain wear a mask throughout the film, but it really did add to the mystery and menacing nature of Bane. Aside from missing a couple of words, I absolutely LOVED his voice and delivery. Tom Hardy really gave a wonderful performance. His movements, his mannerisms, his EYES....he is just mesmerizing as the brutal Bane. By reflex, everyone will compare him to Heath Ledger's Joker, but I never bothered with that going in. By default he will never compare, and I never wanted or expected him to. With that said, he was as effective as Bane as Ledger was as Joker in TDK. For that, he and deserves ultimate respect because Bane is a hell of a villain. Anne Hathaway was excellent as Catwoman. I had doubts, but she really killed her role, surpassing Michelle Pfeiffer simply because she was as engaging and sexy without the extra histrionics. She was such a joy to watch, her brilliance here was just effortless. Christian Bale really carried this film acting-wise. His performance here is no doubt the best in the trilogy. The amount of emotion he was able to convey was heart-wrenching. Never have I seen a (super)hero tortured more; it really was painful to watch, but made the film SO effective when he finally 'rises'. Not only did Bruce Wayne/Batman come full circle, but Bale did as well portraying this character. His Batman voice was annoying at times, but better here than in Dark Knight. Speaking of emotion, Michael Caine as Alfred was outstanding...his best and most touching performance in the trilogy. Levitt was wonderful in his role also, he really has cemented his status as a true player in Hollywood.This is without a doubt Nolan's biggest film, and it shows. His brilliance is in the way he could have the great action set pieces coupled with great acting and engaging, complex stories. The 'wow' moments are plentiful....and the IMAX format made it even more entertaining. When it comes to the story, for an almost 3 hour movie I was a bit surprised by how much more I wished was in the film. I could have sat there for another hour at least.On its own, Dark Knight Rises is a VERY good film. As the close to this amazing trilogy, it's an outright classic. Nolan is a genius, a true visionary who could still do NO wrong in my eyes. The way he has treated this material is and always will be the stuff of legend, and I have never been more satisfied by a character's journey the way I was here. I had no idea what to expect going in, and I'm so excited because this may be the most fitting end to a trilogy as I've ever seen. Everything comes full circle, the core themes introduced in Batman Begins resurface here and puts the film and trilogy on yet another level. There was actually a tear in my eye as it was ending....that is how gripping this film was emotionally; which is a quite a rare feat considering it's a Batman movie. I'm sure I will go see it at least one more time before it makes its way to home video....its that good.In the end, Dark Knight Rises is a very well done, fitting, and extremely satisfying end to the Dark Knight Trilogy. Bravo to Mr. Nolan.",9,2,7,28 July 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A bumbling mess.DC's panic to catch up shines the most here
","The very idea of this movie had me skeptical. I'll admit that I'm a bit tired of superhero movies, but when done right they still can be an absolute joy (i.e. Captain America: Winter Soldier). Once the 3-minute trailer was released, my skepticism was all but confirmed. The trailer revealed way too much and the panic was so glaring it was almost blinding. After finally viewing the film (3-hour Ultimate Edition), I came away perplexed and disappointed that all my suspicions & concerns came to fruition and then some. Jesse Eisenberg was absolutely horrible as Lex Luthor. My friend watching with me said 'he should've played the Riddler'. Nail on the head! Whose idea was it to have Lex Luthor a snotty, schizophrenic, annoying brat? Ugh. It really was painful to watch. Lois Lane had WAY too much screen time; she may have had more than Batman. I don't get the love affair with the character; with Man of Steel and now BvS she seems to be forced into crucial parts of the storyline for no apparent reason. There's just no good reason why I'm seeing her as much as Batman in a Batman vs. Superman movie! I hated the idea of Ben Affleck as Batman when it was announced, but he was tolerable; actually he's one of the few bright spots in the movie. A few things were just flat-out corny, and the pacing was terrible for a Batman vs. Superman movie, as it took so long to get going. When things finally do get going, it's at max volume with epileptic seizure-inducing special effects that affect you in no way. The battle between Batman & Superman – when it finally happens – just left me underwhelmed; especially how it ended (again, corny). I reacted more to a Batman solo action sequence in a warehouse than the 'showdown'. To see a real showdown between Batman and Superman, go see the DC animated film 'The Dark Knight Returns', which was released a couple years ago.Now for the story, or what they tried to present as a story. Man oh man. Talk about trying to do too much! There's just too much going on and its all disjointed. They put so much into this one film and failed miserably as trying to connect all the pieces together; there's no cohesiveness whatsoever. Batman's 'The Dark Knight Returns' storyline, the 'Death of Superman' storyline, Wonder Woman, Lois Lane 'being the key to everything', the reveal of other Justice League characters – in the middle of the film no less - to no real effect, Doomsday, Lex Luthor, out of place dream sequences with no connection to the story, the weight of it all is too much and it just crushes the film. Which leads me to this thought, which I had from the moment this movie was announced: DC is in full panic mode. With the success of the Marvel comic films, DC is playing catch-up and rushing their product to compete. The effort, care and methodical nature in which Marvel has treated their material has definitely paid off; however DC is REALLY late to the party and is making the huge mistake of trying to follow in Marvel's footsteps instead of treating their own material with the same care and planning. It shows in everything DC does, and it is truly hurting them. It really is a shame, because DC's catalog always had a more grounded, adult tone to it, which provided for some very rich material that was so juicy when you sunk your teeth into it. In the end, BvS can be perfectly summed up as wasted potential. How the idea of Batman vs. Superman can be messed up the way it was here is truly indicative of the lack of insight, care & talent in Hollywood (moreso behind the scenes than in them). It truly is a shame at how mismanaged this has all been handled. In the end, BvS has a couple of cool scenes, but its an overly long mishmash of way too many story lines with no rhyme or reason to them, numerous cheesy moments, the Zack Snyder- standard of mindless CGI action mayhem and a grossly, horribly miscast villain; the movie simply fails.** out of 10 stars.",2,4,9,9 July 2016
Casino Royale," Enjoyed it as an action film, not so much as a 'Bond' film....
","I enjoyed myself watching Casino Royale. But obvious problems just couldn't prevent it from being a true Bond film. The very logic of some things just stood out. For instance, this film takes place before all of the others, like a prequel to the other Bond films. Yet I see cellphones and people text messaging throughout the film, and mentions of 9-11! I understand people saying that they have to cater to today's market, but with a source material so rich and with so much history; I personally have a problem when movie makers feel the need to and essentially FORCE a 'modernized updated, today version' on an audience when the very story is supposed to take place before the countless other Bond films, the first one made in 1962 based on a book written in 1952.Aside from that, I can honestly say that Daniel Craig has indeed breathed life into the Bond character itself, as Pierce Brosnan's version was horrible. I liked the look back into the character's history and how he came up; showing that he was indeed not the silky-smooth, 'perfect' spy that we've come to know him as. This Bond film is a more subdued version compared to the other; its more straight-up, which I really liked. A good action/spy film? Yes. As good as a Bond film? Not particularly. 8/10",8,0,1,13 October 2007
Identity," What a great movie...
","Now, THIS is what a movie should be.  Riveting, gripping and entertaining throughout.  John Cusack, who I don't care for at all for his type-casted roles in romantic comedies/dramas...was pretty good in this.  The cast overall was pretty good, I was suprised to see Rebecca De Mornay back on screen, she was suitable for her short role.  Ray Liotta was bad as always, he's great.  The plot twist in this is pretty refreshing; though its something that's been attempted in other films, this movie does it very well, and leaves you even more astounded by its end.  It's a shame that this didn't get more fanfare...I always wanted to see this but just didn't get the chance, and boy am I glad I did.  Wonderful film, definitely one of the best to drop this year.  *** 1/2 out of **** stars.",9,0,1,5 September 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Let's all just calm down with this 'best trilogy ever' talk....
","****SPOILERS AHEAD****Okay, I see that the ultra die-hard LOTR fans didn't waste anytime pledging their feverish loyalty and almost mindlessly 'expressing' their utter amazement with ROTK here on IMDb; hence its #8 spot on the Top 250 with a 9.1/10 rating.  But lets all just calm down with all this 'best movie ever' and 'greatest trilogy of all time' talk.  I even read some people admit that they never even saw any of the Godfathers....therefore their claim of the LOTR being the greatest trilogy holds NO WEIGHT.This movie was pretty good, the visual effects were a sight to behold....they were amazing.  The landscapes along with the battle scenes, particularly the different creatures, were astounding.  With that said, without the loads and loads of CGI, what real substance would ROTK really have?  The film is WAY TOO LONG, and the mere thought of an 'extended edition' actually existing makes me shiver.  If that's the case, why was this movie STILL 3 hours and 30 minutes???  At times its simply a bore, as I caught myself looking away at the screen, looking at my friends to make sure that I wasn't the only one bored out of my mind.  The 'ending' does a great job of disparaging whatever merit the past 3 hours had left.  The film should have ended with Strider becoming King.  That was main premise behind the story aside from Frodo destroying the ring.  We DID NOT need to see Sam get married.  We DID NOT need to see Frodo finishing his book.  We DID NOT need to see Sam AGAIN with his new wife and kids.  We DID NOT need to see everyone bidding farewell to Agent Smith (forgive me if I don't know his character's name), Gandalf and Frodo.  We DID NOT need to see the four hobbits drinking at the local pub in The Shire.  All of this was totally unnecessary and made the movie even more of a bore than it already was. The last 20 minutes were absolute TORTURE.Certain aspects of the story just didn't fit well with me.  I just didn't get how throughout the 3 films, Frodo was billed as the one with sense and a level head...hence the reason HE was given the ring in the first place. The climax with the ring in Mordor on the cliff was just frustrating to watch. He suddenly gets his 'second wind' after Sam saves him yet AGAIN and practically carries him up the volcano.  He runs inside, knowing what he has to do, with the ring over the cliff all he has to do is drop it.  Now all of a sudden he doesn't?  When EVERYBODY and their grandmother has tried to take the ring from him and he's always exercised (for the most part) common sense and responsibility, NOW he hasn't the willpower to do what's right when all he has to do is let go of the ring?  Why didn't Sam just do it for him? But no, we need one last dramatic battle with Gollum before we destroy it. Pathetic.  Other parts of the movie were just plain CHEESY....the dialogue was enough to make me gag.  Somehow Fellowship of the Ring, with the sentimental nature of these fantasy-type stories, seemed to keep its edge while keeping the story going and being entertaining throughout.  But ROTK is all a bunch of eye-candy and grand events with no real substance. I didn't give a damn about 99% of the characters in ROTK...I only hoped that Strider and Legolas didn't die (well Strider couldn't die because he had to become King) because those were my two favorite characters.  Frodo has to be the lamest, dumbest 'hero' ever...all his whining and yelling and crying got tired in Two Towers.  I wanted all of the hobbits to die; what was really their purpose?  It just made everything more silly.  Of course we had to have the 2 true idiots of the 4 go into battle, slaying Orcs...yea right.
I could go on and on about how disappointed I was with ROTK, but I won't waste my time.  But please, just stop with all this 'greatest movie ever' talk.  There's opinion and then there's sheep.  I doubt anyone will even be talking about these movies 20 years from now.  It's a travesty for any of these films to be even mentioned with the great FILMS of the past.  ROTK before Casablanca??????  The MADNESS!!!  I understand the nature of the story is fantasy, which bears a certain level of cheesiness and sappiness. But please don't try to put LOTR on the level of the TRUE MASTERPIECES, especially if you haven't even seen them.  The LOTR trilogy, with its talking trees, wizardry and scary-looking creatures, is just too silly to hold that type of rank, and it never will.  It's the flavor of the month now, but it won't stand the test of time.  With that said, this trilogy was a big letdown.  In my opinion, Fellowship of the Ring is the best of the three, as it was the most cohesive and entertaining without all the slow spots.  Two Towers and ROTK were big letdowns, each of them doing a good job of tainting what could have been a really great trilogy.  Of course I'm in the minority here, but I'm one of the few that can see past the CGI and grand landscapes and see the silliness for what it is....SILLINESS.  I rate ROTK on the same level as Two Towers, but it was even more boring than that, except for the much better battle scenes.  A good movie and decent trilogy, but stop already with the overhype.  I'd take the Matrix trilogy over this any day.**1/2 out of **** stars",4,2,6,19 December 2003
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A classic...
","This is the one that started it all.  Freddy Kruger will always be the most interesting horror movie character, over Jason or Michael Mysers simply because of how innovative and creative he is with his kills.  You can't help but like Freddy because he's so cool.  He represents  a welcomed change from the straight up, 'see someone, kill them' mantra that both Myers and Jason share.  Seeing A Nightmare on Elm Street after all these years, it's still effective.  One of the best low budget horror films, starting the phenomenon of the iconic Freddy Kruger.",7,0,0,18 August 2003
The Matrix," My favorite movie of all time...
","My favorite indeed.  This movie has it all; and the acting is just as good as the mind-blowing special effects.  The cast is great; Lawrence Fishburne is awesome as well as Catie-Ann Moss.  No one can play Neo better than Keanu Reeves.  A instant masterpiece, a cult classic.  BEST movie of the 90's definitely. 10/10",10,0,0,30 August 1999
True Romance," Not as good as the hype suggested....
","**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**With Tarantino writing the script for this movie, it was sure to be entertaining.  But to me, the direction of Tony Scott just didn't fit.  The 'fact' scene between Walken and Hopper, was very well done, but I didn't appreciate the racial slurs used.  I know, I know...I should be sort of used to this when Tarantino is involved...but it still didn't go over well.  I feel the use of the 'N' word was unnecessary in that case.  Nevertheless, seeing Walken and Hopper on screen together was awesome.  The violence was just overkill, the scene with Arquette and Gandolfini was just too much. And what was with the 'True Romance' of the movie?  What romance?  A call girl is called to give Slater a good time, and they end up falling in love? How are we supposed to believe that this is a 'true romance'??  Because they kiss every chance they get?  They've been together for like 3 days or such! Puppy love, anyone?  C'mon.  They could've given it a better title.  This movie has so much potential to be on the level of a Reservoir Dogs, you know, great.  But it falls short.** out of **** stars",Null,4,7,8 October 2003
The Bourne Supremacy," A worthy sequel that stayed true to the original.....
","And that's basically all I was asking for with 'Bourne Supremacy'; seeing how much I enjoyed the original, 'Bourne Identity'.  After watching the trailer it was pretty obvious that they were going to stay true to what they started.  This is the reason why Bourne Supremacy works.  Matt Damon seems to have been 'born' for this role, he performs it very well.  Joan Allen was effective in her 'more subdued than normal' role.  The chase scene in the end was very entertaining....it probably ranks up there with other great chase scenes.  The hand-held camera technique gave the film a realistic feel, but I'll admit at times it was a little hard to see what was going on. The story here was as good as the first, and the pacing was right on....they don't waste any time getting in the thick of things, and that was good to see.  This 'Bourne' franchise really has something going here, and I feel as long as they stick to the formula they've mastered they could very well carry it even further.  It's smart espionage/political/spy/gov't material executed very well on film, regarding film technique as well as acting. It's safe to say that they're '2 for 2'; I'm anxious to see if they're going to continue this...if they are I'll be looking forward to those installments.***1/2 out of **** stars.",9,2,2,23 July 2004
