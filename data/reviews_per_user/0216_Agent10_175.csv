The Blair Witch Project," 87 minutes of pure hell
","Every year, there is a film which somehow defies convention and makes a boatload of money. The Blair Witch Project, along with the likes of the Mummy movies, Titanic and Spider-man. Sometimes, the stupidity of the mainstream populous can make a film a winner, and this unfortunately seems to defy most conventions. I mean, this movie even impressed people at Sundance. What gives! I gave this movie 3/10, simply because it had one of the most innovative marketing campaigns of all time (I thought it was real when I learned the truth a couple months before the release), and it really was an interesting concept film. But then again, it lacks in so many other areas. I wish I could get my life back, and that seems to be the only power the Blair Witch has.",3,1,3,6 May 2002
The New World," A beautiful viewing experience
","It takes little knowledge to understand the future impact a film like this will leave behind. While many people feel the movie is rather pointless in it's scope, the juxtaposition of images, voices and music will create a visual experience that will be hard to equal any time soon. While film school students strive to be the next big thing in cinema, people like Terrence Malick make films that turn the industry on its head and makes them take a hard look at the product they create.The New World by all accounts is an amazing film. The depth of space and detail made the extra cost of using 65mm film all the more worthwhile. Subtle details and colors that seem devoid in most 35mm films indicate the artistry and scope the filmmakers put into this film, making us forget about the complexities of the modern world. The film grabs you right out of the gate, from the first moments of John Smith's Christ-like imprisonment to the last beautiful shots, it leaves one to guess why Malick isn't more prolific in his films.This film also leaves a deep impression of good and evil, once again falling quite nicely into Malick's need to juxtapose the frailties of good with the savagery of evil. While ad campaigns try to pass this off as some cheap Titanic knock-off just to sell a few tickets, don't believe it.This is a one of a kind film, comparable only to The Thin Red Line, and years from now, the lucky few who watched the film in theaters will carry fond memories.",10,14,29,21 January 2006
Alien 3," Better than what people give it
","A lot of people think I'm crazy when I say Alien 3 was a good movie. This film is like the black sheep of the series, villified even though it enhanced the series in ways other than action and dialogue. Charles Dutton was as good as any other character in this series, and he was probably the strongest character among all of those in the series (behind Ripley of course). For a first film, David Fincher brought a lot of great ideas to the table. The 'Alien POV' shots were awesome, bringing a disorienting shot which inflicted genuine fear. A truly unappreciated film.",7,8,11,18 April 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Worst in the series, but what do you expect when the sole intention with this film was to make money
","Sometimes, making something so big and epic just doesn't work. Granted, much like the millions of people who went to watch this movie, I can honestly say this film was like another Return of the Jedi. While the amount of special effects shots was tremendous, the technology didn't seem to enhance the nature of the beast, but more like taking the predetermined ideas and relegating it to nominal status. Too much to put in simpler terms. However, from a lay standpoint, the film was entertaining in many places, giving us a taste for what will be expected from the other two movies. A solid effort to say the least, but one that needed a little more work.",7,1,2,30 April 2002
Ali," Boxing when it was still a legitimate sport
","While many have put this film down for not being realistic enough, I say, who cares! Michael Mann created a well shot and conceptualized film, especially considering he had a one-sided actor in Will Smith in his lead (who I thought did a respectable job portraying a difficult role). The film overall was excellent, portraying some of the inner insights of a man who most of us had only seen on TV or in the occasional documentary. What really fryed my kettle was the plethora of sports writers (most who were kids during Ali's prime) acting like this wasn't a true representation of one of the most influential people in sports history. What the heck do they know! As a sports writer myself, I know for a fact most sports writers have no idea about what makes a good film. However, I will say this, it is rather interesting to watch a film at four in the morning on Christmas Eve.",7,0,1,14 June 2002
Catch Me If You Can," Nice piece of fluffy drama
","This was the first film I have ever seen where I wasn't totally disgusted by Leonardo DiCaprio's presence. Maybe it was the fact that Tom Hanks was in the film, or it was the fact that DiCaprio actually acted well in a role. Either way, this movie was rather nicely done and well put together. The story also proved to be unique enough to grab someone's attention. Steven Spielberg also made a welcome change of pace, getting away from the sci-fi genre for a nice little foray into a light drama. What would have been really interesting was if the real Frank Abagnale was somewhere in the film, considering he looked nothing like DiCaprio. Anyway, this a was a pretty good film overall.",7,0,2,11 June 2003
The Ring," Engaging and creepy horror film
","While I liked this film and found it rather enjoyable, some aspects of the film have become a rather bland trend in the horror genre. Ever since The Sixth Sense, a little kid has to be the nexus of supernatural subplots and manipulations. Please! I will give Gore Verbinski a good pat on the back for actually creating an eerie film that makes your skin crawl in many areas. However, the first ten minutes, the little kid and the terrible dialogue by the little girl proved to keep this film from getting an 8. I will state this, the cinematography and sound were quite excellent, signifying the care and patience put into this film. 7.5/10",8,4,8,10 November 2002
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Captivating piece of adventure cinema
","Most great films happen by accident, at least that's the way it used to be. Films like this just don't happen anymore, simply due to the overhyping world of marketing and what-not. But even to this day, the film still resonates with cool action sequences that were well ahead of its time. Adventure never looked so fun and realistic when comparing this film to the many action films that have come out since. To this day, the fact this film made 250 million seems downright unbelievable, and they didn't have the benefit of overpriced movie tickets and overwhelming hype machines. Definitely one of the coolest film series ever.",9,0,1,2 April 2003
United 93," A bit hard to read
","United 93 tends to reveal a lot of arguments about why 9/11 happened. While conspiracy theorists speak their minds and patriots vehemently try to discredit them, United 93 is a bit misplaced in this foray.It evokes such a wide array of emotions and responses that one starts to struggle with the true intent of the film. Are we supposed to hate Muslims? Are we supposed to blame the government? Or is this so implausible that this is just some attack to go against what the conspiracy theorists speak out about? It's an interesting quandary, but in the process, Paul Greengrass made a super-realistic film that will certainly spark debate (and in the case of my father, a lot of racist hate). United 93 will most likely be the definitive film on 9/11, even though the whole genre to this event has really yet to be touched. Until something more sinister is brought along, this will be a tribute to those that were in that plane.",7,2,5,23 May 2006
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," E.T. = exceptionally tremendous
","If it wasn't for all of the babies crying in the theater, the reissue of this great movie would have been a better experience. While some will call ET nothing more than a sappy kid's movie, I feel this film brings much more to the table. The compassion, the acceptance, and the eventual paranoia surrounding ET made this film something to enjoy. With the remastered soundtrack, the experience proved to be even more breathtaking, adding more power and magistry to a film I thoroughly enjoyed as a kid. However, some of the remastered special effects were unnecessary,  especially the guns- turned-walkie talkies effect Spielberg employed. I mean, what stubborn, rebellious kid is going to be afraid of walkie talkies? They should have just kept the guns. When this one comes out on DVD, I'll just pretend the special edition never happened.",10,51,83,21 May 2002
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," The best live action/animation hybrid of all time
","This film was not only a visual delight, but it was also one of my favorite films for quite a long time. While movies today like Scooby Doo needlessly put 3D computer images with people, this film did a much better job with 2D images. Roger Rabbit had to be the best `New' character created in quite a while, even though he was supposed to be old and what not. With some great characters and plenty of cameos by some of the best cartoon characters in cinema history, this film still rates as one of Robert Zemeckis' best movies. Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd were excellent in this movie, which was well acted all around.",8,1,1,21 June 2002
Minority Report," Interesting take on the future
","While still feeling the heat from the so-so effort of A.I., Steven Spielberg redeemed himself wit ha more constructed effort and one that was more suitable for hard-core sci-fi fans. Once again, he tackled an interesting story, one that could change the complexion of society as a whole. Only this time, he did it right, making this more of a thriller as opposed to a movie about family values. While all the action sequences could be placed in one trailer, it was still a fairly interesting story with great little insights about the technology of this future world. The only downside, proved to be Tom Cruise. Once again, his average acting style came out in full force, running through a movie with little emotion and guidance. And to make things worse, this seemed like one big commercial for companies like Ben and Jerry's, Lexus, Guinness, Pepsi, etc. I kid you not. Well, with the nit-picking aside, this was an excellent film for sci-fi fans. 7.2/10",7,0,1,21 June 2002
Training Day," Raw and surreal
","Denzel Washington as a shady police officer? I didn't think he could pull it off, but he did so with grace and believability. Ethan Hawke was perfect as his goofy wannabe NARC, which brought about an interesting dynamic between the two characters. For once, Denzel Washington got out of soul brotha' routine and played a character with some inner conflict and depth. I must also say, Antoine Fuqua had his best directing effort thus far, combining all the best elements from Bait and The Replacement Killers to make this sound and riveting street thriller.",8,1,13,20 May 2002
Friday Night Lights," A true waste of a fine story
","I love sports films. They sometimes have that clichéd quality to them that makes them watchable, which is why there are very few ever made anymore. Sadly, the only way to make a good sports film is to find something that actually happened or possibly shoot the film in a way that is unfamiliar in its context. FNL failed on both accounts. Not only was this film a blatant rip-off of Michael Mann's visual acuity, this film also failed to mention the 'Based on a True Story' tag was utterly false. There were many little details that were in the film that actually happened in the book, but the racism, the separation of the classes, and the economic strife that was in the book didn't come to life on the screen. Instead, the over used story lines that were portrayed in the film became something of a bore, and the nice cinematography couldn't save this film. I found it rather dull and a sad betrayal of the truth. And what is even sadder, Buzz Bissinger has sold his soul just to make a buck off the book by calling the movie accurate. So who cares if Odessa can't acknowledge it's racist past? Can we ever not acknowledge the Germans were Nazis? The tinkering of the truth was the real issue for me in why I despised this film, because let's face it, the truth would have been a lot more interesting. Read the book and you'll find out why.",1,15,33,9 November 2004
Se7en," Very little to say
","I've never been at a loss for words in regards to a movie, but Seven always presents such a dilemma. How do you judge something so unique? What can you say that hasn't been said? This film will always be a classic, one worth watching multiple times over. I can never imagine anyone playing the roles of Mills and Somerset other than Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. And the ending! Sometimes, saying very little is all one needs.",10,0,0,25 April 2002
The Big Lebowski," The Greatest Bowling movie ever!
","This film will always be remembered as one of the best comedies ever. Its so over the top, one has to wonder how the Coen brothers were able to fit in all of the various storylines and plot elements into a neat, 98-minute package. This film completely changed my opinion of John Goodman, who I always thought would be some goofball hack for run of the mill comedies. Kudos to the Coens. This ranks as my favorite Coen brothers movie, until they find another way to reinvent themselves.",10,1,3,17 April 2002
Unbreakable," Unbelievable
","M. Night Shyamalan's follow-up to The Sixth Sense felt a bit slow and painful. While the story as a whole was intriguing, the pacing was so horrible that I felt like yelling at the screen `move around a little!' While the lack of editing has never bothered me before, this slow nature of the film and the drawn out scenes kept me from giving this film a higher grade. Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis gave great performances, making the bi-polar nature of their friendship feel real. With the exemption of the editing, Shyamalan's effort certainly wasn't lacking.",8,0,1,8 August 2002
Fight Club," Gruesome, yet brilliant.......
","Fight Club will be prodded, studied and viewed for years. Whether its putting down the fascist ideals of conservative America, its speaking volumes about the pointless intricacies of wealth and status. Fight Club isn't about violence, its about the expunging of shallow capitalist maxims and rebirth, an epiphany of real life.Granted, the film's own preaching can be twisted and used against it, but the inherent messages one can derive from such a film will be deeper and more meaningful than your trite romance or teen-sex comedy. A gem for all who have seen it.",10,1,3,11 April 2002
Citizen Kane," Greatest Movie Ever -- and who's to argue
","For all of those who feel The Godfather is the greatest movie ever, give yourself a knock on the head with a blackjack. If it wasn't for Orson Welles lavish and sometimes eccentric film, none of the conventions used in this film would have ever been utilized elsewhere. Citizen Kane not only changed the face of Hollywood with a story that encapsulated a grand story into two hours, it also helped usher in a whole new perspective of looking at film, discovering different forms which never would have been conceived. Not only was the story engrossing, the technical aspects of the film proved to be a cut above the rest, still looking contemporary in this world of split second edits and explosions. No film has ever captured a self actualized person like Kane, a man who has everything and can do virtually anything he wanted. In a way, it is a telling tale of our current media ills, allowing one person or one organization to own too much, creating his own slant on the news for his own wishes. It's a shame Welles had to wait so long before receiving acclaim for this film.",10,1,2,13 August 2002
Memento," A huge thank-you to the investors who believed in this film
","I still find it hard to imagine no distributor would pick up this film. Virtually everything about this movie enhances the nature of its being. If it weren't for the belief of some hard-nosed investors, no one would have seen this movie. Editing has never been my strong suit in analysis, but this film really brought some perspective to the medium. Maybe its a good thing this film didn't win any Oscars. It would have been cheapened by the reviews of individuals who are too impatient to experience the film. This will easily be a film that will be studied for many years to come. Certainly one for the DVD collection.",10,0,1,18 April 2002
Alien: Resurrection," the weakest in the series, but still had its moments
","Obviously, all of the problems experienced in pre-production doomed this film. While the trippy nature of the film was intriguing, it was lacking in so many areas (I mean, how big is this ship where you have to run for seemingly hours to get from one point to the other). Anyhow, this film needed a few more drafts in the script, and it was obvious Winona Ryder phoned in her performance. However, the lighting, cinematography, CGI and editing was excellent. Even the aliens looked better than ever. Sadly, nothing else exceeded any expectations.",6,2,3,5 May 2002
12 Monkeys," A great alternative in the Sci-Fi landscape
","This is quite a film. Not only was it made for a small price tag, it delivered the goods with a strong story, a strong technical backdrop and a dark nature which isn't often seen in science fiction films.Terry Gilliam achieved a a huge boost to this film. When I look back, the choice to make him director seemed the most logical. Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt thoroughly surprised me, and I wonder what would have happened if neither of these two went for this movie. Pitt easily could have become another pretty boy, but he kept choosing unusual roles such as this one and eventually Fight Club. This is a great little film to watch.",8,1,2,5 May 2002
Rocky V," Should have been burned
","Let's face it, this film never happened. As far as I am concerned, this film was just a simple misnomer, one of those things a person chooses not to talk about because of the sheer madness associated with this film. I'm surprised no one's careers were fatally damaged after the making of this film. Surely, one of those anomalies which is best kept under the rug.",1,11,20,8 June 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Certainly a fun movie to watch
","Johnny Depp saved this movie. There, that's all you need to know. POC was a pretty good film overall, with excellent production design worthy of any spectacular epic film. But it was one character that made this whole movie worth watching, Mr. Depp. I have to say, that without Depp, this movie would be tanking worse than Charlie's Angels 2 with an anvil attached to its foot. The eccentricities of his character Jack Sparrow provides such an energy to the film, you can't help not saying a good word about it. Every one of the characters were fairly hollow and boring, but Depp's portrayal of Sparrow provided a nexus for all of the other characters to feed off of. To say the least, this film was fairly entertaining, even if Orlando Bloom seemed completely out of his element. This is one of he few times I will say a movie was good mostly for its entertainment value. Rarely do pirate movies grace the landscape of overly expensive action movies and remakes, but this movie really hit the spot. Go to enjoy this film, because you might be surprised.",7,1,3,10 July 2003
The Fifth Element," A great change of pace
","Most sci-fi films try to break new ground with special effects and visual eye candy, but The Fifth Element created a whole new concept in the genre: the art-action science fiction.While this film has many flaws, particularly in the flow of the plot, visually, it surpasses most sci-fi films I have ever seen. Not even Planet of the Apes (2001) could compete with this film's cinematography. I firmly believe 1997 was a great year for this concept of film, considering the highly visual Alien Resurrection came out the same year. Hopefully, some of the more modern sci-fi films will encompass some of the visual ideals this film set forth.",7,59,112,18 April 2002
Batman Returns," Strange things are afoot in the mind of Tim Burton
","Tim Burton probably should not have made this film the way it was. For the most part, it was rather decent in its implementation and design, but it was just far too dark and unusual, like the set designers were in the middle of some acid trip while creating the backdrops of this film. I felt this should have been the last in the series, simply because Tim Burton took this film to a level that was too out there for most regular film goers to conceive. A decent film, but just too much to handle in regards to eye candy.",6,0,1,13 August 2002
Finding Nemo," Too cute and innocent for me, but still pretty good
","Pixar can never do wrong, it will never do wrong, and it will make money from any movie it makes. Without a stellar voice cast or an obnoxious ad campaign, this movie proved that Pixar doesn't need to hype its own films anymore. I really thought this film would be a sinker, but the first week grosses proved otherwise. What I do admire about this film were the underwater sequences, which proved to be rather vibrant and more cutting edge than the previous Pixar films. While being a cynical 20-something, I can't say the film was particularly brilliant beyond visual appeal and animation, but for the younger kids, this is definitely quality entertainment a parent can take their child to.",7,1,2,11 June 2003
Blade," A bloody good time
","After seeing nothing but movies about Dracula when it comes to vampires, Blade brought a new spin on an old story. This was a great, wild and funny film, thrown together with some genuinely chilling moments and cool special effects. The action industry actually did something right by making a film with some intrigue and intelligence. Wesley Snipes fit the role of Blade perfectly, never indulging us too much with sly dialogue, instead proceeding with the standard butt-whooping. Movies like this are just great to watch, especially the last fight scenes with Blade and Deacon Frost (thank goodness they changed the ending). And the scene in Moscow was priceless!",7,0,1,14 May 2002
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Kind of like a botched root canal....
","I never knew Troma Films were making chick flicks. Oops, what was I thinking. Then again, this film is so lame and predictable, the grinding of millions of males teeth could be heard in the theater like a sonic boom. Hollywood's excuse for putting out inoffensive tripe like this is yet another pathetic cry for help, one where the rehashing of ideas and plots and almost banal dialogue makes one wonder if the sanctity of foreign films without the subtitles will be the respective norm of escaping such garbage. This film also continues the rather lousy trend of trite chick-flick movies (I'm talking about Two Weeks Notice, Just Married, Deliver Us From Eva, and Maid in Manhattan) that mysteriously lead the box office. Perhaps the foreign film goers are right: American films are becoming a dull collection of clones and remakes. Here's an idea, instead of torturing captives and putting killers to death, make these individuals watch this film around the clock. Such inflicted pain will reform someone quickly and make any future terrorist squeal like a dirty pig.The only one being honest about the rehashing trend seems to be George Lucas, who knows his Star Wars saga is retreading familiar ground, and does little to dispel such ideas. However, films like this cannot accept the truth, and sadly, the viewing public doesn't seem to care.",1,10,20,10 February 2003
The Mummy," Garbage, trash, refuse, crap, feces, manure......
","I'm sorry, but I ran out of words to properly describe this movie.Seems humanity likes something about as smart as a wood pole infested with termites. Granted, most people like such mindless expenditures to pass the time, but I'd rather be doing a term paper about quantum physics than sit through this drudgery of a film.Where can I begin. The dialogue was horrible, the special effects were Ed Wood-esque at best, and the story just outright stunk.How this movie turned a profit is more amazing than how the statues on Easter Island were built. A sad blip on in history which will be horribly dated in, oooohhh, maybe two years.",1,4,10,16 April 2002
The Mummy," This film is so bad, I had to write a cleaner review just to make sure my disgust about this film is known
","The Mummy = two thumbs down.This film clearly represents one of the many reasons why indie film makers are always bitter and sarcastic. How could such a film with such bad dialogue, action and special effects make so much money? Is there some kind of research group looking into this! I mean, how is this possible! Are people really that shallow!How many more times will I use an exclamation mark in the review to illustrate a point! I could see how someone might be interested in watching this movie, simply due to the concept and idea, but wouldn't people be weary of seeing a second installment considering how poorly made this film was! Maybe there was a conspiracy by the producers who made this film. Maybe they had all of the theaters that exhibited this film turn up the thermostat, creating good reviews due to heat-induced asphyxiation! I think someone should look into this. My keyboard is already waiting the inevitable bashing of The Scorpion King and The Mummy 3.",1,2,7,18 April 2002
Constantine," Decent film, but still full of holes
","To say the least, Constantine wasn't as bad as it could have been. Any film with Keanu Reeves attached to it seriously has a potential Razzie nomination waiting in the wings. But this time around, the film wasn't too bad. The obvious put downs will be Keanu's rather pitiful acting, which ranged from horrid to downright hilarious. But what proved to be even more annoying was the fact so many people talked in whispers. Speak Up!! Also, a couple of miscasts must be called out, especially with Shia (can't spell his last name) and Gavin Rossdale. Everyone else seemed to fit their roles all right, but those two could have been left on the cutting room floor.But then again, their are plenty of good things. The story was complicated and interesting, which kept you within the story as opposed to being lost in an array of explosions and big-breasted women. All of the occult stuff within the film was also quite engaging.I guess in the long run, this will be one of those films that will be okay to watch and pick at, just maybe not one you want to buy.",7,1,16,27 February 2005
Insomnia," A dark ride in the subconscious
","Following up a movie like Memento must be quite a chore, but Christopher Nolan did his best. Insomnia is more of a focus on photographic technicalities, allowing the more mainstream viewer to experience Nolan's dark and cryptic style of focusing and cutting. But then again, Insomnia isn't just about cinematography, it's about the nature of human beings and their passion for the truth. Al Pacino portrays the troubled cop Will Dormer to a hilt, letting his natural wrinkles and facial expressions become a natural prosthetic. While the dialogue was simple and direct, the entire history of the characters could be told in the first few minutes of the film. Hillary Swank and Robin Williams' characters had very little history or motive, but then again, their stories are not as important as Dormer's. However, such a miscue in storytelling leaves a hollowness to the picture, turning everyone into a fickle backdrop for Dormer's troubles. Overall, the story was well put together, and executed by the numbers. While David Julyan's score was good, he should have sought to stay confined within his bounds as he did with Memento and Following. 8/10",8,1,2,24 May 2002
Sleepy Hollow," Excellent version of a classic tale
","Tim Burton tackles the tale of Sleepy Hollow, and he does so with charm and a lavish production design. While true followers of the story will be upset over the major change in the story (witchcraft, science, the fact Crane is not a teacher), one cannot look pas the great cinematography and lighting throughout the film. Coupled with a great production design and some interesting camera angles, one cannot help but fall in the love with this world locked within the bounds of German Expressionism. Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci both gave strong performances, making this a neat little film to watch.",7,0,0,13 August 2002
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Always the classic war film
","When a movie tends to be parodied by The Simpsons as often as this one has, it must have been good.It's a grand pleasure to watch a film with so many underlying meanings and messages. This film could be considered the first indication of Kubrick's genius. Up until 1964, Kubrick was still a bit mainstream, engaging in projects which most grand directors undertook when they reached a certain level of fame. Kubrick took the opposite direction, distancing himself from such rituals by encompassing a persona which was technically un-Hollywood. This movie stands up very well, especially in these times of nuclear threats and possible war.",10,1,2,28 April 2002
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The weakest one in the original trilogy, but still darn entertaining
","Granted, this one was a bit weaker in the grand scheme of things, but it helped Lucas the foremost authority on cool special effects. Everything was ahead of its time: the space battles, the lightsaber battles, the speeder bikes, etc. Its amazing to imagine how far we have come from this piece of work to what we can do now. However, the special effects and make-up seem to be the only redeeming value of this particular chapter. The plot was fairly thin, the acting sometimes phoned in, and there was too much emphasis on the violence and special effects. But then again, who am I too argue? It was a good film in the action film genre, which is much better than your typical mindless action feature.",8,0,2,30 April 2002
Final Destination 2," Creepier, gorier and better put together than the first
","I was apprehensive when I didn't Devon Sawa in the credits or this movie, but then again, this film didn't really need him. This wasn't a sequel in the purest sense, but the film makers created methods to link all of the new characters to the old ones, creating a flow which wasn't too jarring. Unfortunately, the dialogue was the only real stinker in this film. The pretentiousness, the obviousness and the downright hokiness that came out of the mouths of the characters really detracted from the tension, turning their performances into a bunch of acting class rejects. But I digress. The only thing people are looking for is how Death will get the new set of escape artists. The sheer surprise and execution of the executions made me jump and crawl. In such a desensitized world we live in, being able to jump out of my seat means this film is a winner.",7,52,83,31 January 2003
Blade II," Kind of shallow
","While I liked Blade, this film seemed to disappoint in some areas. The plot was very tight, yet the action seemed to last forever in some areas. While I loved the fight scenes and the harder edge they all had, the film still felt lacking. It's weird, I enjoyed it, but it could have been so much more. Maybe it was Whistler's revival that was too awkward, or the Bloodpack being strange or the fact the part of Asad was over acted. Considering how much is destroyed and how many are killed, it was a fun experience. But it left kind of an empty feeling after watching this film.",6,1,5,14 May 2002
Alien," The best in the series
","Alien is easily the best in the series of great films. While it doesn't have the action of Aliens or the cinematography of Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection, the concept is what makes this film the superior. While technology will always make the chest bursters look more realistic or the aliens look more sinister, this film brought about a change in the genre, a 'milestone' if you want to call it. H.R. Giger should have won an Oscar for set design. No creature looks more imposing than the aliens in this series.",9,0,1,18 April 2002
Malcolm X," X is for excellent
","Having never really known Denzel Washington before this movie, I was quite impressed by his performance. The power in his voice and the anger he exhibited was quite profound, making you think he actually embodied the character he was portraying. Much more powerful than films like JFK and Nixon, this movie depicted a controversial political character better than any since its release.",8,6,16,20 May 2002
Battleship Potemkin," Light years ahead of its time
","Eisenstein created the Russian Montage Theory, and this film is his finest example. It took years before someone could utilize his ideas and make them work (The Limey, 1999). Nonetheless, the baby carriage scene really demonstrates the discombobulated nature of RMT. Granted, like most movies, it gets long in some parts, the beauty of the film is amazing. One of the best silent films I have ever seen.",9,19,35,9 May 2002
Taxi Driver," A movie experience not to be missed
","In my favorite Robert DeNiro movie ever, Martin Scorsese introduced us to the mind of a man with a serious wannabe-hero complex. Wonderfully shot and conceived, this film was one of those movies where you have to see to believe. While his scene has been mimicked and mocked so many times, seeing DeNiro perform his mano-o-mano bravado routine on his mirror is still fresh and cool, even today. While many of Travis Bickle's tendencies are unclear, its all about his reactions to the people surrounding him. How Bickle responds to everyone else in the world is really quite priceless. And to think, Jodie Foster was doing Disney films at the time. It's really hard to analyze a film that has been analyzed to death. Nonetheless, this film will be remembered forever.",10,0,0,8 August 2002
Full Metal Jacket," Kubrick's version of Vietnam
","Stanley Kubrick always managed to bring something new to his palate whenever he made a film. He brought dark comedy to the screen with Dr. Stranglove, an epic story with Spartacus, and a film more important for its efforts than box office potential in the film Paths of Glory. This is what makes Full Metal Jacket so entertaining.Humor, horror and political commentary are the themes which shape Full Metal Jacket. From the overbearing drill sergeant to the war loving soldiers. It all seems to make sense within this film, never overstepping its bounds or being to subtle. Kubrick may have alienated some his hardcore fans with such a mainstream-type story, but then again, he helped mainstream movies take a bold step. What doesn't the current cinema owe Kubrick?",10,118,173,28 April 2002
The Grapes of Wrath," One of Henry Fonda's Best
","Even though good books rarely ever turn into good movies, the Grapes of Wrath sheds such a belief with beauty and charm. Granted, the acting may have been hokie in some parts, but the message is clear: the world is full of haves and have-nots. This is easily one of the few `old' movies I could watch on a regular basis. Even after all of the suffering the Joad family goes through, the clinging hand of hope still firmly hangs on. Certainly one of the best films ever made.",9,8,14,28 April 2002
Glory," A terribly underrated film which deserved better
","With one of the best ensemble casts of all time, this ranks as one of the best war films of all time. With a collection of great black actors like no other, everything seemed to work well in this film, from the cinematography to the acting. Edward Zwick created a masterpiece, which, in any other year, would have swept most of the major awards. Sadly, this did not even make the AFI Top 100 so inferior movies could squeeze in. In my opinion, the likes of Born on the Fourth of July and Driving Miss Daisy were vastly inferior to this film during the 1990 Academy Awards. I mean, how the heck were films like Dead Poets Society and My Left Foot nominated for best picture when  this one wasn't? (sure they were good films, but c'mon)Matthew Broderick completely surprised me with his performance, as well as Cary Elwes. And one cannot forget the likes of Denzel Washington, and Morgan Freeman giving great performances as soldiers weary of being the Union's lackeys. While the historical accuracy may not be perfect, as least this was a tribute to those who helped emancipate the slaves during the Civil War.",10,123,149,9 July 2002
Rocky II," A pretty good sequel
","Sure, Apollo was pointlessly painted as the bad guy early in the film, but this a sequel. While it is not as good as the first film, it still embodies many of the themes and hopes which made the first film so powerful. This time, the audience got what it wanted, a win for a guy who had been kicked down for so long. With more money, the film felt more lucid and better put together, which made it a whole new experience in itself. I especially enjoyed the scene where the kids are chasing Rocky, certainly one of the most complicated and time consuming shots of all time, considering all of the extras the various sequences needed. Better than an average sequel, it still pales a shade below the original film.",7,28,38,8 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A good film for all to see
","Anything could have been better than Episode I, and this film provided much more than just a standard plot. Sure, critics blasted the middle act (which is a bit long), but what the heck do they know. While I despise George Lucas for his self-indulged sense of deification, he made a bold statement with this film. Full of political intrigue, this movie really brought a new turn for the series, making the film something more than just the typical adventure film with a lot of shooting and fighting. While I did not like the choice of Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker (the guy is more chicken-scrawny than DJ Qualls from The New Guy), his presence will hopefully be short lived. Ewan McGregor, Samuel L. Jackson and Christopher Lee saved this film from being average, simply because most of the acting was fairly substandard. Even Natalie Portman proved to be a little out of her element in some points in the film. While the special effects and digital film was give na big broohaha in the industry, it proved to be of little effect in the film. Sometimes the digital effects looked painted on, like they had no business being in the film, but then again, moments like the huge battle was well made. In my opinion, George Lucas should have put a little more violence in this film. As it is, this film managed to get a PG rating! He should have made some parts more darker and scarier, like show us Anakin killing all of the Tuskan warriors. Oh well. A good film, and I can't wait to see what happens in part three.",9,0,2,14 June 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," The best animated film of 2001
","In my opinion, this film should have won the first Oscar for animated film. Don't get me wrong, Shrek was good, but this film had a little more passion put into it. The story and characters were more diverse and, the animation was much more complicated. Kudos to the casting agent who was able to bring in talent like Frank Oz, John Goodman, Billy Crystal, and Steve Buscemi to play the roles of some of the actors. If you haven't seen the version of this film with the out takes and company play, then you should get the DVD when it comes out.",9,1,2,21 May 2002
Top Secret!," Silly, needless film
","Val Kilmer's career has evolved naturally ever since this crap fest of a film was released in the hallowed year of 1984. While the tandem of Zucker and Abrahams were still feeling the vibe of Airplane! and The Naked Gun, this was still one of those films which makes you wonder why it was released. Sure, funny moments are laced all throughout this film, especially when the giant bird statue takes a dump, but this film barely falls under the category of cult status.",6,2,9,13 August 2002
Predator," One of the great action films of all time
","Arnold Schwarzeneger wowed the world in one of his coolest roles ever, battling an alien deep in the jungle of South America, where little help could be offered. What I especially liked about this film was the attitude: always high octane and ready to fight. This film easily ranks up there with some of the best action movies of all time, simply for its minimalist approach, doing more with less and relying on tension to make the film exciting as opposed to big explosions. Good fun, along with one of the coolest lines ever uttered by the venerable Jesse Ventura (I ain't got time to bleed!).",8,0,0,13 August 2002
Léon: The Professional," A perfect ten from Agent 10
","-May contain Spoilers-I originally watched the US version of the film, The Professional, and thought the movie as it was was superb. Then, lo and behold, I found the European version of the film, which seemed to show everywhere but here in the US. Let's just say, I'm going to send a nasty letter to the MPAA someday soon.First of all, I could see the whole 'sexual tension' between Mathilda and Leon as unusual, but that's what harnessed the energy of this film. Why wouldn't someone feel attached to a person who saved their life? Also, the Russian roulette (which, amazingly, is called American Roulette in Russia) scene was top notch, something that should never have been taken out of the film.Anyhow, enough with the pontification, and on with the review. Luc Besson could win Oscars and awards for the rest of his life, and this would still be his greatest work ever. Granted, Nikita was just as good, but this film had more clarity, a betterscript and Gary Oldman. Jean Reno is one of the most under appreciated actors in the world, forced to prostitute himself in films like Godzilla and Rollerball to keep food on the table. Thankfully, he will always have this movie to look upon. For any who haven't seen the 133-minute version of the film, go and find the European version. You may be forced to shell out a little more money, but in the end, it will be worth it.",10,2,6,18 April 2002
American Pie," Sadly, a great waste of celluloid
","American Pie pretty much displays the downfall of society, and I'm not being iconoclastic about it. How could such a collection of low brow jokes and bathroom humor be considered entertaining? This film is nothing more than garbage, which is sad because at least garbage could be studied in regards to sociological conditions of familial households. As for this film, I can't find anything remotely pleasing to say.",1,9,20,11 April 2002
The Bourne Identity," It's the little things that make this film work
","While the action genre is as believable and formulaic as an NSync song, The Bourne Identity takes a much needed step to the side to watch oncoming traffic. Subtle, yet still holding true to multiple action formulas (lots of fighting, cool weaponry, and chase scenes), this film presents a new era of action film making which could be all the wave. Matt Damon, who has the unfortunate nature of watching his less talented friend Ben Affleck gain notoriety for trash movies, is an excellent choice as the CIA operative turned amnesiac Jason Bourne. His presence is both believable and realistic, like he is some guy who looks like a bookworm. While the film's cinematography was rather average, there are moments in the film which presents actual anxiety. The viewer knows something is coming, yet the genuine far exhibited by the characters makes those moments so interesting. I thought this would be some average action, but I walked away amazed. Franka Potente played the role of Marie perfectly, even though some prettier and less talented actress could have been placed in this film. Kudos to the producers for the casting choice. 7.4/10",8,54,78,14 June 2002
The Italian Job," Ouch! The Mark Wahlberg's acting is hurting my head!
","Sure, no special effects were used and every stunt was real, but couldn't they have used some better computer technology on the actors. I assumed people like Mark Wahlberg, Charlise Thieron and Ed Norton were in this movie, but they looked like something ripped out of `Simone.' Has Pixar finally replaced the human actor? It sure as hell felt like it with this film, as everyone involved went through their scenes with tongue-in-cheek dialogue and virtually expressionless looks of pain on their faces. Norton had a reason for blowing off this movie due to a contractual obligation, but what was everyone else's excuse. When Mos Def is your most sincere and most likable character, what does that tell you? Send this one to WGN and TBS, for I'm pretty sure they will showing this film ad nauseum sometime soon.",3,1,3,11 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The best film of 2001
","Epics aren't easy to make, but Peter Jackson created a masterpiece of a film. This movie will easily detract all of the failed efforts he has engaged in, especially the god-awful The Frighteners. While Star Wars may be considered the superior series and Harry Potter the more popular of the fantasy epics, LOTR's depth and more subtle use of CGI effects proves to be far superior to the saturated blue-screens and matte paintings Star Wars and Harry Potter employ. I never took Elijah Wood seriously as an actor, nor Sean Astin. I was very apprehensive about these two being in this movie, but those fears were quickly alleviated when I witnessed the seemingly natural friendship the two displayed in the movie. Maybe that is why New Line made all of the movies at once. Eventually, friendships had to form in this type of setting, and such ideals would become rather convenient throughout the scope of the story. This is by far a good beginning, and fans of the books (like myself) won't be subjected to inconsistencies and older looking actors considering all of the principal photography is finalized. Which leads to one question. What kind of money would one get having to be the film clerk for this trilogy?",10,2,3,21 May 2002
28 Weeks Later," As good as a non-sequential sequel goes
","Now a lot of people were initially skeptical about this movie. No Jim, no Naomi and no Hannah in this movie. You got to be kidding me!! It looked like a lame attempt by some lame Americans trying to Americanize (therefore making it lame) a perfectly good Euro-thriller. What we got was something far different.28 Weeks can't top 28 Days, which is something I want to mention right away. But this film was surprisingly effective. While it did possess some plot holes, they were not enough of an issue to make the movie unwatchable. What we get with this installment is a taut and gripping movie that is both political and intriguing in its composition. From the first scene of Robert Carlisle running for his life to the last, we get a sense that the gloom and doom of this world follows the original vision of the film a little more closely. We all know Danny Boyle wanted Jim to die a the end of 28 Days Later...., but he chose to make the ending much happier. This movie is just downright bleak, a perfect reminder that not all cool movies need to be happy at the end to leave a feeling of satisfaction when you leave the theater. Juan Carlos Fresnadillo did the best he could even though he had to use the cheap mediums of CGI to get the same effect 28 Days Later did without them. But one thing he did maintain was just the downright creepiness of the Rage victims. Unrelenting and genuinely scary, their thirst is still quite a sight to see. While the ambiguous ending laid the foundation of another sequel, at least they proved a movie with a completely different cast and crew can still carryover quite well.",8,2,6,19 May 2007
The Thing," Wicked Good Film
","John Carpenter at least has something to be proud of for the rest of his life. A great cast, some great creature effects, and an ending which seems to capitalize on this film's tough-guy motif. Better than the original, this seems to be an oddity in John Carpenter's career: a film that can actually scare you. Certainly an amazing little film.",8,0,1,6 May 2002
Lilo & Stitch," A brilliant ad campaign that delivered
","Disney has always been considered a lumbering giant in the industry, but the success with their innovative ad campaign for Lilo and Stitch definitely intrigued me enough to get my butt in the theater. While making fun of their most successful movies, Stitch actually embodied the 'bad boy' image Disney tried to make him out to be.Sure, his emotional transformation is not exactly unexpected, but the story and how the plot moves along is certainly more innovative than some of the recent fare Disney has churned out. All be said, the people who brought us Mickey Mouse have created yet another memorable character in Stitch. Sure, the movie was your typical kiddie movie, but there proved to be never be a dull moment.",9,1,2,29 June 2002
He Got Game," A dark and unsettling film about basketball
","It finally happened, and the movie we all thought Spike Lee would make became reality. With Lee's own little foray into the basketball world, I always wondered when he would create a story which reflected his unique views of the game. While sometimes over sensationalized, he depicted a seedy world comprised of two-faced individuals all the way down to the seedy high school coach to the professional agent. I also felt it depicted some very frank images of the cultural aspects of athletics, the sex, the money and the little freebies. While the film didn't need the story between Denzel Washington and Milla Jovovich, it was strong in most aspects. It was a bit of a change of pace for Spike Lee, considering the graininess of the film stock and the rather mundane colors. Also, Ray Allen had one of the best pro athletes-turned-actor performances in a long time.",7,13,18,20 May 2002
Pitch Black," Better than I expected
","Going in, I thought this movie would be some schlockfest. Two hours later, I was rather surprised. While some will call this an Aliens' knock-off, I see as something much more. Its more jarring, just as intense, and just as unique as Alien. Every character had their little background story, which is something that is rarely ever dealt with when it comes to flashy, sci-fi epics. Vin Deisal's performance finally sold me on his talent, and could be the next Arnold Schwarzeneger (and he even has a better voice!). The scene where he is eye to eye with the flying beast is simply heart-stopping! Who would have the guts to do something like that! David Twohy made quite a gem. Now the real question: Will anyone ever remember it? I hope so.",7,0,0,6 May 2002
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Remarkably Average
","No more!!! The franchise is over. The engine is dead. The hot air balloon is out of steam. I don't care if the next movie is given 200 million for a budget, for no amount of money could quell the avalanche of mediocrity which has now become the accepted norm in most movie franchises. There are no more angles to approach, unless you introduce yet another new Terminator that is faster and more powerful than the original. Hopefully, Arnold will be worrying more about politics than another Terminator sequel because we simply don't need one. I will admit, many of the special effects shots and the chase scenes were rather cool, but it seemed so predictable in the grand scheme of things. On a closing note, Kristanna Loken was damn hot as the TX. Beyond that, this movie didn't exactly break any new ground.",5,0,0,10 July 2003
U-571," Somewhat entertaining, but turned into pro-war propaganda
","This was one of those films which tried to appeal to a specific demographic while sadly trying to reach another. I'm sure the WWII generation took a nostalgic look at this film, it was really for all of the brainless mugs who like action movies. Sure, some of the submarine sequences were rather good and the tension was gripping, this film was really pro-war balderdash that didn't even present the facts right (never mind the fact the British were the ones who obtained Germany's Enigma machine). Not bad or good, this film will get a 6/10 simply due to the film's production value.",6,0,1,1 June 2002
American Beauty," Pointless endeavor with no redeeming qualities
","Quite possibly one of the least deserving Oscar winners of all time, American Beauty simply spikes a hot iron into my hide every time I hear praise dished out to it.I will admit, I thought it was pretty good the first time around, but then, I realized my lack of insight proved to be poorly developed. Like a bad wake-up call, I realized how stupid and idiotic this film was, kind of like enjoying a video game from 1986, then seeing how poorly it has aged compared to today's standards. American Beauty accomplished this in a matter of months. The characters, except for Lester, had no point. The kids were poorly drawn characters, excessive moot that could have been edited out of the film. This film had no idea what mood it wanted to be, no semblance of consistency, and no reason to be made in the first place. A film I will continue hating until I'm six feet under.",1,10,26,17 April 2002
Disturbia," Sometimes silly, but still quite watchable
","Any movie with Shia LeBeouf is subject to some squirming. Let's face it, he helped the Evil Empire (Disney for the uninitiated) grow thanks to his successful show Even Stevens. But as Shia has gotten away from Disney, his range continues to get better. Granted, Disturbia and Transformers are not Shakespeare, but it is far better than farcical garbage like The Greatest Game Ever Played.Anyway, Shia plays Kale, a pretty chippy kid who slugs his teacher after due to a crack the creep makes about his dead father (which he had a hand in). first of all, I will say this: the teacher deserves it, even if Kale was being an idiot and a jackass. Anyway, this puts Kale under house arrest and he has to spend all day with his hot mom Carrie-Ann Moss. Of course, this all leads into the eventual 'Rear Window' plot line that was pushed in the trailers, but it is still pretty satisfying. Kale's paranoia is pretty interesting to see, considering he seems to have no qualms about jumping the gun. This leads to one of my eventual pet peeves about this film. Why in the world would this guy get any chick? Here's the formula: being a peeping tom and ruining a girl's party will get you some head. Nice equation there guys.I have always liked David Morse, and his creepy, swarmy antagonist certainly brought some cool moments within the film. Its good to see him playing a bad guy again, which suits him so well because of his charm and rugged good looks. Either way, a spot on choice for the bad guy.Other than that, there was really nothing that stood out about this film. I give it a seven for the effort and making a film that didn't utterly bore me to death while throwing in a little humor to boot. Good stuff for a midnight-type showing.",7,0,2,18 May 2007
Edward Scissorhands," A character I most closely identify with
","-contains spoilers-In the movie Edward Scissorhands, the writing style of the film was a perfect match to the emotional and sociological story being told. In retrospect, the working script to the film is rather placid and full of gaps, but the cinematography creates words and speeches that aren't enhanced by human subjects. A person's place in the world is determined by the acceptance of others, i.e. the suburban middle class. The character Edward Scissorhands represents many subtexts the film didn't wish to make obvious. His place in modern society is eschewed due to his unusual outward appearance. His black clothing and pale, white face clashes with the status quo. Director Tim Burton intentionally altered the landscapes and clothing to imply these messages, making Edward the center of a pastel-loaded world. But it is also this difference which ultimately breathes life to his alienation from society.Conformity was king, and not a spoken word was ever uttered about such a subject through out the movie. Instead, there are several moments that create this instability. The very moment Mrs. Boggs sees Edward, she instantly judges him as some killer/rapist before feeling pity for the befuddled individual. Throughout the rest of the film, Boggs tries desperately to make Edward look normal like the rest of the neighborhood, ultimately failing in such a diversion. Another example would be Edward's lack of dialogue during the film. While Johnny Depp physically embodied Edward, the quiet demeanor of the character constructed a stark contrast to everyone else in the world. Edward kept his mouth shut so he could fit in. He accepted everyone's good will with little more than a simple `thank you.' During the entire movie, Edward didn't even speak 100 words. While other characters made assumptions and jokes about Edward as a person, few of them ever looked deep into his soul. As it turns out, Edward's personality was established by what he did as opposed to what he said. Using his actions as the only frame of reference, Edward possessed many traits which were complex. He truly didn't know the meaning of wrong and right, even though he understood the means of enforcing such boundaries. For example, when he broke into someone's house, he knew it was wrong, but he did it anyway because someone asked him to. He was an impressionable individual, seeking personal satisfaction through friendship and even love. Edward was also terribly shy, which explained his inability to make friends. Instead, he felt doing good deeds for people would create a sense of camaraderie with the community. At first, cutting people's hedges and hair made him the focal point of everyone's life, but after a while, his welcome was worn out.  People were tired of him, and like some board game that is no longer challenging. In the end, Edward returned to his solitary life, forever existing in his own little world of extroversion. Words didn't force him to return to this world, but the personal opinions and a rigid establishment did.",9,0,0,2 May 2002
Rocky IV," The second best in the series
","While multiple sequels tend to stink after a while, this film really bucked the trend. Sure, the bad 80s rock was cheesy and unnecessary, but it proves to be the most accessible of the entire series. Add in the whole USA-vs.-Russia theme, and you have a sure winner. Fun, and most certainly uplifting, this film is really the second best in the series. No one could have played Ivan Drago as well as Dolph Lundgren.",7,1,4,8 June 2002
Being John Malkovich," Genius
","I'm at a loss for words with this film. How does something so odd, so unique not get any mention in the annals of brilliance and genius. Hollywood maybe has seven or eight types of movie ideas that are repeated ad nauseum, but Being John Malkovich somehow managed to stay away from those predetermined molds. Spike Jonz made a fine effort in his film debut, and the whole conundrum of the film created an interesting question. This film could easily have been some cornball flick called Being Tom Cruise or something. Yet it stayed true to its form, commenting on our obsessiveness to be someone else, to be something greater than our 9-5 jobs and big screen TVs. So many things to talk about, and so many things to look at a second time.",9,1,3,28 April 2002
Spider-Man," Maybe they should make a superhero who has the ability to make a good movie
","-contains spoilers-Wow! What a waste of money, talent and film stock. Many elements have to fall into place for me to completely hate a movie to the point where I feel like setting the movie theater on fire. Where to begin.Before the bashing begins, I will say Tobey Maguire was very believable as Peter Parker. Hhmm, that seems to be the only thing I can say that isn't snide or cutting. First off, Hollywood should now realize this whole 'replace-the-human-with-CGI-effects' idea just doesn't work. It didn't work in Blade 2, and it certainly did not work in this film. Maybe imagination or blue screen acting would be more appropriate than trying to replace the human form with fake and awkward images of light and bit maps. It was like a bad video game. The dialogue also felt forced in many areas, especially when Parker tried to reveal his true feelings for Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). They did it twice, and it still didn't work! David Koepp went from writing Panic Room to this slop! I haven't seen a dive like that since a Don King promoted fight.Typically, I rarely put down music, but then again, I think its time for Danny Elfman to go on some reunion tour with Kajagoogoo or whatever the heck the name of that band was he played for. Its obvious he has lost his touch. In fact, this entire movie wreaks of Batman, which was a far superior movie.The music was a blatant rip-off of Batman, and the movie even tried to rehash certain elements and moments. Let's see here: a chemical turns Willem Dafoe into a maniac, Dafoe's character trying to be nice to the superhero at the end before trying to kill the hero, the scene where the editor calls all of Parker's photos 'crap' (which was exactly the same way Batman did it), the Green Goblin killing a group of people who want to rub him out of the picture (like the Joker and the other mobsters), etc. The similarities are far too numerous to number, the only difference is that Batman actually had some flair and magistry. This was nothing but a high, gloss picture with pretty images and mind-numbing editing techniques.I should have stayed away considering Sam Raimi had directed this film, but for some odd reason, I decided to follow the crowd. The lesson: be yourself and watch something else.",1,7,18,3 May 2002
Collateral," Mann returns to his roots
","If it wasn't for Michael Mann, L.A. wouldn't look like a hip and cool world devoid of artistry and intrigue. Let's face it, the city is the real star in the movie, illustrating its compact world and displaying why it looks so multi-cultural. The lights, the darkness, and the shadows all mesh well with the technology and shallowness that is always associated with the city.But enough about L.A. The film in general is worthy of its late summer release: enough plot movement to keep you interested and a script that isn't weighed down with overbearing cliches. Throw in the great camera work and a not so hammy Tom Cruise, and the film works on multiple levels. And speaking of Cruise, the more he tries to get out of his typical character, the better he seems to look. His portrayal of Vincent is spot on, even if a few of his monologues in the cab seem a little bit contrived. Jamie Fox also produced the same effect, showing that both actors can actually do something if they work with a talented director.It's hard to say much more about this film due to its utter (yet fascinating) simplicity. It's just one of those films that you have to experience and get swept away with. Sadly, there aren't too many like that anymore.",8,1,3,20 August 2004
The Machinist," A well made thriller, but tends to bring little else to the table
","The Machinist is a movie much in the same vein of The Jacket: well sculpted and put together, but it's short comings are far too glaring. The difference is how everything unfolds within The Machinist, a taut, yet slow-moving film that becomes fairly predictable at the first sighting of Ivan.The one thing that really makes this film work is Bale, who quite literally gave his all for the film, which in many ways, makes you forget about some of the obvious moments in the script. While the lighting and general eeriness of the film really brings you in, Trevor Reznik's decent into madness doesn't follow too well with the scenery. It's like trying to shoot a film at 60 miles an hour while the script only let's you get up to 35. The ending just couldn't live up to the rest of the movie, which had a great build-up but just seemed to fall flat.",7,1,1,27 June 2005
Aliens," A fun ride
","While I liked Aliens, James Cameron managed to do something that no other director in the history of filmmaking has ever done: he enhanced a movie series and simultaneously ruined it.While Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection aren't exactly the best films, they would have been a more natural progression in the series. The dialogue, the cinematography and the pacing was more conducive to that of the original film. As for Cameron, while his film is entertaining, he brought nothing to enhance the series artistically. Granted, I love all of Hudson's one-liners as much as the next person, it just didn't fit with the vision of the original film. All in all, this film presents a conundrum for me. I watch the film whenever its on TV or whenever I'm bored, but inside, I can't help thinking about what Cameron did to the series. Maybe I need to see a shrink or something.",8,1,1,18 April 2002
The Fast and the Furious," Fickle film making against a backdrop of stupidity
","Mindless, thoughtless action was happily brought to you by this crum-bum of a movie. While I did like the cars in the film, especially the modified muscle car, this detail just wasn't enough to call this a legitimate story. Paul Walker seemed horribly out of his element. Are we supposed to believe his is an actual cop or some wannabe? Vin Deisal was solid in his role, but nothing else could be gained from this relatively low brow film.",3,6,13,26 May 2002
Ocean's Eleven," A good remake of a cool movie
","While the original was much better due to the presence of the Rat Pack, this turned out to be a witty and fast paced retooling. I think this film would have been better without the star studded cast. In my opinion, Julia Roberts should have been chucked for some other actress, simply because her role was so small and worthless. Nonetheless, George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon were superb. I also felt Scott Caan and Casey Affleck were a perfect match for the bickering Malloy brothers. I didn't like the fact Steven Soderbergh made a film as mainstream as this (considering his previous work in The Limey, Kafka and Traffic), but I guess he had to sell out eventually. Certainly a good film. 7.5/10",8,0,1,21 May 2002
The Usual Suspects," Not enough good things to say
","Such films like this should be enshrined in museums, simply due to the fact it destroyed the entire genre of mystery films. While this film was unique and captivating, no other mystery will ever accomplish this sort of cult status, single handedly shaping a genre. While most mysteries try to shock you too often with twists and even more twists, it turns out to be overkill. This film encompassed such ideas with flair and originality, which is probably the reason Brian Singer is sticking to sci-fi action films. Only Memento and The Game are the only recent mystery movies worthy enough to stand beside this film. Sadly, Singer has somewhat sold out by doing the X-Men movies, but I guess trying to make films like this would be too taxing. This film will always bring a smile to my face when I watch it with someone who hasn't seen this movie. A good viewing every time I watch it, the new special edition DVD is awesome.",10,319,438,1 June 2002
Die Hard 2," A strong follow-up to the original
","I was expecting the worse when I saw this film, but this movie seemed to escape the curse of the cheesy sequel. Just as action packed and enthralling as the original, the wit displayed in this film saved it from being a mediocre follow-up. Bruce Willis was once again a great hero, showing how little being considered a hero means to him. A good film with a great plot twist, this is one of those action films which is just as good as the original.",7,54,83,15 May 2002
Resident Evil," I actually liked this film
","While never having played the games, the movie was rather interesting. Granted, the acting wasn't exactly something to write home about, the music, cinematography and the lighting proved to give this film a boost. The production value was also exceptional, allowing the effects to be legitimate as opposed to being some hokie paint on CGI. I've also wondered, Why does Milla Jovovich show her breasts in every movie and photo shoot she is in? Gets kind of dull after a while. Anyway, I will state this, the ending proved to be one of the finest constructed moments in sci-fi history.",7,1,2,20 May 2002
Independence Day," Awesome sci-fi film!
","To this day, I'm still amazed how well this film did over seas. While the action genre tends to bore me, this was a film that actually delivered some of its promises. Will smith was annoying in some parts, but that's what you get when you hire a guy for his over acting. The special effects wee excellent, and the detail placed in the alien's attire, spaceships etc. was exceptional, considering the art department could have tanked in this category. Fun film all around, and the alternate ending on the DVD is hilarious. It makes you glad that focus groups can be good for something.",7,5,12,10 May 2002
No Country for Old Men," Oldschool Coens at their best
","After some real clunkers (Intolerable Creulty, The Ladykillers and that bad Superbowl ad), it looked like the Coens might slip into the subconscious of Americana. But they came back with a vengeance in No Country For Old Men. Tapping into their earlier, much darker work like Blood Simple, Fargo and Barton Fink, they once again crated a work that will nicely compliment body of work.The truly brilliant detail in NCFOM was the story the Coens didn't tell. Sure, we are engrossed in a cat and mouse game between a simpleton and a cold-blooded sociopath, but it is the other little details that allows you to create your own conclusions about the characters and the story. Why does it seem that everyone is constantly running from the past? Why is Anton Chigurh such an introvert? And why did Llewellyn Moss give up his simple life so easily to essentially become a bum? These are all questions that are not asked but are created when watching this movie. I especially like the fact that all of the characters back story was reveled more in their voices and dialogue rather than being explored through contemplation and back story. One example is Tommy Lee Jones, who's character is so devoid of strength and conviction that the horrors of the real world seem to shake him to his foundation. His retirement at the end only prove that he didn't have what it takes to take someone down like Chigurgh. This is where I believe the title's significance comes into play. His character, due to his gage, was no match for a man that was far more prepared than he.But the most amazing aspect of the film was the Coen Bros. belief in leaving a lot of the story up to the viewer. In the end, the overall lesson is that money will corrupt any situation, much like the little boys at the end fighting over a bloody 100 dollar bill. This film is truly a revelation, and second only to There Will Be Blood as the best of 2007.",10,1,7,24 January 2008
Batman Begins," Pretty standard addition to the saga, but at least it was entertaining
","To say Batman Begins belongs in the top 250 is quite a stretch. While the film seemed to have few shortcomings, you just knew this would turn into some cliché studio film that the masses would eat up.I will start with the good stuff. I will say, watching this film was pretty interesting, for this version of Gotham City is a little more colorful (yet subtle) than in previous movies (let's not even start about Batman Forever). I had doubts whether Christian Bale could hold his own in this film, but I guess anyone can be wrong on any given day. He does have a presence to him that is quite strong and focused, much in the same way Michael Keaton played Batman, who was tiring and strung out in his versions. The casting was pretty good, getting a wide swath of actors as opposed to the flavors of the month. I was especially happy to see Gary Oldman once again (this time in a normal costume), for you never know what kind of nuance you'll get with him in the picture.This sadly leads to the dreadful parts. Katie Holmes, Katie Holmes, Katie Holmes. Just like that waste of space, she was a waste of a perfectly good role. Sadly, Cillian Murphy barely existed in this film, and his character was a rather intriguing one. Another factor in the film that was completely cliché and a juxtaposition of 'trendy' film-making was the whole ninja shadow army (or whatever the heck they called themselves). I would have much rather preferred the whole battle with organized crime as opposed to the Shadow thing. The pacing wasn't that great, but it was starting to get too long I guess. And let's not forget the utter absurdity of the new Batmobile, which was ridiculous.Batman Begins will certainly make money, but hopefully they do a much more polished job on the next film.",7,2,4,22 July 2005
The Princess Bride," If I was stuck in a medieval love story, this would be the one
","Witty, delightful, colorful, astounding, and endearing. For anyone who does not like this film, its clear you have nothing else to look forward to in life. Even after 15 years, I have yet to find a film that even closely resembles this classic. That's why it will have such staying power, a presence which one will remember and pass it on for others to see. The film was well cast, from Wallace Shawn to Billy Crystal, all the way down to Mandy Patinkin, Christopher Guest and Andre the Giant. Sadly, Cary Elwes proved to be his own demon by starring in some fairly horrid films after this feature, forever placing himself in the annals of B-stardom. Hopefully, this film does not fall into the doldrums of anonymity. If you haven't seen this film, go out and get the DVD. You won't regret it!",9,1,2,30 April 2002
The Transporter," Who needs the essentials of film making when you are having so much fun!
","I didn't expect any dialogue, plot or real creativity, and I came out very satisfied with this experience. I will note this as a piece of brilliant stupidity, and film so bad that it is funny and breathtaking in its concept. While the audience simply blurs through fight/action scene aimlessly, at least they were well made and not all made on some guy's laptop. Funny and often times engaging, at least the producers knew they were making this film for pure action freaks and theater jumpers looking for a good second film to watch. Highly recommended, but feel free to get drunk or stoned or whatever because being sober or inebriated won't take away from the flow of this film.",7,0,1,10 November 2002
Seabiscuit," Never thought horse racing would be so interesting
","When the original trailer for Seabiscuit came out, I was extremely skeptical about this movie. But after watching it, one can appreciate the technical brilliance of the race sequences and the down-home feel the story brings. Forget the underdog connotations and what-not, for the real pleasure of the story was how it unfolded. From the effects of the Great Depression and the need for national stability, the force of an icon like Seabiscuit was quite interesting to see on the silver screen. Chris Cooper and Jeff Bridges were especially good in this film, making their opposing dynamics work with charm and realism. However, Tobey Maguire was especially good, putting on his game face for a movie that required one, not the opposite (like Spiderman). Watch the movie for the great race sequences, and enjoy the heart-felt simplicity of the story.",8,0,0,2 September 2003
28 Days Later...," Definitely worth your money
","Danny Boyle hasn't done much since the incredible success of Trainspotting. Consider this a major make-up of lost time. I was skeptical about the use of the digital camera, but in the end, it proved to be a wonderful device for this particularly gritty and slightly off kilter zombie film. While the whole zombie genre has fallen on hard times, 28 Days Later presents the subgenre in a way that seems more modern and timely as opposed to some random curse or some explanation that doesn't make any real sense. And the emotions displayed in the movie are so realistic and carnal, one can't deny the idea of these type of actions taking place. What I especially liked about this film was the care and devotion the film makers went through to make this film look authentic and real. With the exception of one shot, the empty streets of London look as barren and hopeless as the continuation of mankind. Cillian Murphy was positively wicked in his role as Jim, and the rest of the cast was absolutely stellar in their simple (yet complex) character arcs. For those that love the horror genre, this is certainly one for the ages, one that will hopefully allow the horror genre to right itself.",8,1,2,10 July 2003
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Ridiculous follow-up that should not have been made
","Talk about a crack-pot idea of a movie. As if the whole concept was bad enough, the film lacked in so many parts. No one wants to hear about the mother-father, lovey-dovey, flower child-hippie dialogue! So what! They're big, nasty animals that can kill and eat you! I will say this, Pete Postlethwaite was great as the hunter, bent on capturing himself a T-Rex. However, one of my questions is: What happened to Vince Vaughn after they escaped? He pretty much disappeared from the movie. Nonetheless, this movie proved to be a brutal mistake, one that should not have been punctuated on.",4,0,1,13 May 2002
City of God," Great film that deserved to be recognized
","One thing is for certain, City of God didn't back down on the shock value. From the random killing of children to the more organized gang violence, City of God is more of a testament to the failures of capitalism rather than a failure of law and order. Either way, the film was a stunning depiction of a world no one really gets to see. This is a world you don't see in the tourist guides or in the movies.What was especially incredible about this film was the dirtiness and authenticity. Instead of making this film on some back lot or recreated set, this film was actually made in the slums of Rio. In fact, the slums themselves become a major character in the film, illustrating how disgusting this world truly was. Adding even more authenticity was the use of non-professional actors. While many critics have panned films that have used this paradigm for acting, the lack of false reality made for a rather well acted film.Years from now, this will be considered one of he best foreign films to hail from anywhere, and it is time to take some notice.",9,4,8,14 August 2006
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A remarkable film
","I've never been much of an Ang Lee fan, but this film quickly made me one. While I enjoyed the Ice Storm, this film reinvented Chinese cinema as we know it. Granted, it meant nearly breaking the bank to make the film, but the style and artistry was amazing. Yeun Woo Ping did a spectacular job of choreographing this film, even though his greatest achievement thus far is turning Keanu Reeves into a respectable martial artist. After watching this movie, I can't wait for Zu Warriors to tumble into town. But, I also have to feel bad for Ang Lee when he made this film. Just imagine, if this film didn't do well, he would probably become just another good `foreign director. ' Let's just hope The Hulk isn't some bad comic book turned into movie. Let's hope it is better than the horribly bad Spider-man.",9,1,1,5 May 2002
JFK," Conspiracies and paranoia: Oliver Stone-style
","While this film may create more conspiracies and accusations, it is certainly one that makes a lot more sense than some of the more conventional theories placed on the Kennedy assassination. While I have never been a big buff for this infamous moment in history, I was thoroughly entrenched in this masterpiece by Oliver Stone. It seemed like no one phoned in a performance, and Kevin Costner certainly earned his paycheck in this film. One of my favorite films, epic in its nature and construction, JFK has left an imprint on me about how a film should really be made.",8,1,11,15 May 2002
X-Men: The Last Stand," Talk about limping to the finish line
","Amidst the explosions, bad one-liners and cool special effects, those that made this movie subtly insulted the intelligence of all that watched this film. Hmmm, no exposition, no background, no development, and of course, no dialogue. In a span of 100 minutes, the fruits of two great movies was for naught as the whole concept of the X-Men franchise was flushed down the drain by a bunch of short-sighted boobs.It's hard to really focus on who brought the movie down more. The writers clearly had a hand in it because it's quite obvious they didn't notice that the movie was filled with rather useless lines and quotes. It probably would have been better off as a silent film. We could blame Brett Ratner, the biggest gravy training chump in the industry, for his lack of insight and inability to really make a film. Or we could blame Halle Berry, who's Touch of Death has now inflicted this franchise just when it looked like she was going to be written out of the saga. And to make matters worse, too many new lame characters were introduced when some of the best (like fricking Gambit) continued to be on the back burner.Let's just face it, this film is just a cluttered mess. While fanboys will flock to the theaters and push the no. 10 on the ratings list, they are only deluding themselves from not fully witnessing the troubling truth about this film. Another sequel couldn't save this franchise, not even if Bryan Singer comes back and Rattner goes back to directing schlock. Sadly, the once great franchise has withered away due to short-sightedness and putting those without talent in charge.",2,5,8,27 May 2006
Good Will Hunting," One of the best films of 1997
","Matt Damon and Ben Affleck shine in a film full of shining moments. There seemed to be very little wrong with this film, and it is a shame the Oscar committee decided to pass on this film as the best of 1997. Not only were Will and Chuckie endearing characters, every one else in the film conveyed a smooth and natural performance. Even Minnie Driver proved she could fit in her role as Skylar. This film also introduced me to Stellan Skaarsgard, who I think is a very underated actor. A great follow-up of `To Die For' from director Gus Van Zant.",9,18,37,7 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Faster paced and more artistic than the original
","Sadly, the best film of the year won't get the recognition it deserves. This just proves that Oscar voters will most likely forget about an incredible film that serves as more than just a transition to the ultimate chapter. From the first shot of the film to the very last, the artistry and proficiency in this film showed more than Fellowship of the Ring. But like its previous film, it will be forgotten because it is just too grand and beautiful for anyone to comprehend. It just goes to show that some people have all the luck. Peter Jackson doesn't need to make anymore films in his life because these ones will be his lasting legacy. TTT was also much more bearable to watch. The three-hour run time isn't as severe as the first film, considering the pacing and the editing is much more polished and succinct. I will remove myself from rating this as the best in the series, merely because I have yet to see the remaining film.",10,0,0,28 January 2003
School of Rock," Linklater successfully blends mainstream humor with a little intelligence
","When I saw the poster for this film, I wasn't very hopeful. I like Jack Black, really, but his recent slew of films is not one to be proud of. Thus, the rousing success of this movie was rather good. Smart, funny, and really entertaining, this film doesn't insult your intelligence while the filmmakers don't try to. Jack Black is exceptional, and the kids are simply awesome. I can't comment about the technical aspects too much, but one thing I did like were the slow reverse shots that demonstrated Black's ability to act not only comedically, but also physically. And as a hard rock lover, it's a welcome relief to see a movie about hard rock that isn't bad considering the overflow of bad hip-hop theme movies running amock. Studio bosses, you have been notified. Take a good rock idea and run with it, don't give us the crappy 'Rock Star' and other movies.",8,0,1,8 October 2003
Amadeus," Interesting look at a musical icon
","Milos Forman created a masterpiece of a film, using second tier stars and a film about a famous conductor. What we get is one of the most exceptionally made films of our time, consisting of wonderful sets and performances, especially by F. Murray Abraham. Sadly, like so many stars before, Abraham pretty much fell off the map, never grasping a role that was tailored to his particular style of acting. Nonetheless, a well crafted film which should be revered for its beauty and grace, and it won eight Oscars to boot.",9,2,4,13 August 2002
The Game," ....and when it was all over, I was blown away
","Very few films have captured my attention the way The Game did. Every turn, every corner seemed to have some hint of intrigue and deception. This film would be the life's work for any major film maker, but then again, this David Fincher were talking about.Years from now, when Fincher is honored with his lifetime achievement award at the Academy Awards, his true fans will always remember this film. It put a whole new twist on the idea of 'plot-twist.' One of the few films me and my father both liked (we never agree on any film).",8,189,268,18 April 2002
Hero," Certainly worth the wait
","After being in limbo for so long and waiting for two years, Hero was certainly all that it cracked up to be.Great cinematography, solid action and interesting use of color, the film was far more impressive and grand than I thought it would be. Jet Li's performance in the film didn't really leave a lasting impression, which to me, is the only reason why the film doesn't get a 10. He was great in the action scenes, but unfortunately, his character was far too one-sided. However, I did like the portrayal of Broken Sword and Flying Snow, for they were really the heart of the film and gave the movie its lasting impression. People will credit the action and the audacity, but the movie was really came together in the editing and production design. Without those two elements, the film would have been just another Crouching Tiger knock-off. Also, the musical score created by Tan Dun was incredible, mixing in with the fighting and the sound design to make a deep and layered experience.But the real question is, how will this film be remembered? History buffs will certainly like, and fans of Asian film will find it interesting. To me, the potential for this film has yet to be seen, and I hope it is considered a classic of martial arts and art intertwining perfectly.",8,0,0,30 August 2004
No Man's Land," Poignant and effective
","Most films often times try to sour you on the subject of making choices, that decisions always have a dire consequence to it. No Man's Land portrays this kind of entanglement as well, but it does it in a way that is dignified while providing a stark social commentary. Little differences are often times the only things that create conflict, and this movie beautifully illustrates those sentiments.It seemed rather fitting that this film won the Oscar for best foreign film, topping the widely popular Amelie. Often times, war is portrayed through one narrow perspective and rarely deviates from its aforementioned ideology. But this is one of those rare films that shows how we are all affected. This was a great film to watch, and in today's war-mongering world, it's sends quite a message.",8,1,2,14 May 2002
K-19: The Widowmaker," Just proves critics know nothing about good film making
","Forget the critics, forget about the whiney Russian sailors: this film is worth watching. This just goes to show how idiotic the general viewing public has become. Critics have become nothing but a bunch of 'good review' whores who work for commission and free gifts. It just goes to show idiotic they are, embracing schlock like Spider-man but putting down audacity like this film. For shame. With a good cast, excellent tension and Harrison Ford, they still want more action and silly exposition. Maybe it is the subject matter, or maybe it's the fact Harrison Ford isn't killing anyone and trying to act sexy, but I cannot understand why anyone would put this film down. I don't think this film is detrimental to the reputations to the Russian sailors, who were portrayed with gusto and bravado not exhibited in most submarine films. Also, the claustrophobic nature of the film must have been difficult to film, considering the close quarters the characters had to work with. Overall, the film probably could have used some fine tuning, but the way it is, it is still quite a film to watch. 7.2/10",8,157,215,22 July 2002
Back to the Future Part III," Second best of the series
","Sure, it was unnecessary and unneeded, but this film was still a great movie to watch. The logistical challenges were much more interesting, and the whole meaning of the series seemed to take on a new twist. Imaginative and fun to experience, the hillarious backdrop of the film is quite entertaining, especially Seamus McFly. Some may say this was just a bunch of rehashed scenes from the two previous films, but who cares. This proved to be one of the more enjoyable trilogies in film history.",7,5,7,19 March 2003
Patton," George C. Scott's gift to Cinema
","It seems only George C. Scott could have played the tyrant known as George S. Patton. His mannerisms, his crustiness, and his harsh use of language fit Scott so perfectly, one could wish Scott was Patton.Technically, the script was top-notch, full of nice anecdotes and militaristic language which added some authenticity to the film. Also, the production value added a sense of reality to the film, allowing the viewer to witness a battle much in the same way Patton would have seen it, never fully engaging us in the brutality of the war, yet more on the brutality of the person behind the controls. If one hasn't seen this film, then set aside three hours and prepare to be amazed. A fitting tribute to one of cinema's finest actors.",10,3,8,23 April 2002
Transformers," Decent, but weighed down by a sloppy script and humans
","We all knew the Transformers would be well made, well crafted creatures due to the utter genius that is Industrial Light and Maghic. But its too bad the human element was what bogged this movie down.Sure, we'll watch the movie, but there was just too much exposition and for us impatient, Ritalin-riddled miscreants of the world, it was excruciating. First of all, the script was pretty lousy. Now I know the guy who wrote this film supposedly wrote X-Men, but lets face it, that was a good seven years ago. There were plenty of things that could have been chopped out of this film. Now I understand the producers wanted to get a little titillation with Raechel Taylor and Megan Fox, but they were both dead weights to the movie and the movement. Without those two, we could get rid of Anthony Anderson, another waste of words, and maybe even expand Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson's roles. Either way, the female element in the film was completely useless. Let's face it, guys watched this cartoon growing up, and we want action, violence and lots of transforming. Who fricking cares if Shia LeBouf's character gets some action. Its completely irrelevant. It would have also been nice to see some conflict between Megatron and Starscream.The only other thing I didn't like was the awful soundtrack. The strings portion of the film was pretty substandard, borrowing the most generic themes one could possibly imagine. Then there is the random songs and generic heavy metal they try to slip in. It was like the people who mixed the film took a lesson from the dopes that mixed Daredevil, which had an equally awful mixture of CD sales-friendly mixing.But I digress. For those that had doubts about the transforming, it was put to rest rather quickly. Dazzling to say the least, it was as realistic as one could have hoped for, making the transformations rather cool. ILM must have put their best and brightest on this movie, because it certainly shows. This brilliance alone made up for the bad exposition and substandard characters. I gave this film a '7' simply because it was entertaining, but they are gonna have to tighten up the screws for future sequels. People won't put up with unnecessary characters and bad music for very long.",7,18,40,3 July 2007
Men in Black II," As lifeless as the acting
","With much anticipation, this film proved to be a downer. Sure, the creature effects and the pacing was good, but it just felt like it was old and hackneyed. Considering the story was so much similar to the first movie, it felt like we had seen this all before. Sure, the quirkiness of the movie really filled some lagging moments, but it just wasn't enough. Will Smith's performance was dull and uninspired, proving he has a long way to go before becoming a real actor instead of just some box office gimmick (see Tom Cruise). Tommy Lee Jones was good in the film, but that was only because his character wasn't annoying like Smith's faux-Chris Rock-without-the-profanity performance. Sure, the movie will make 200 million easily, but I'm sure more than a few people will walk away disappointed.",5,1,2,3 July 2002
Rules of Engagement," Solid Film, even despite the rather mundane ending
","(some spoilers) Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson were quite good together in this film, producing a rather interesting dynamic between their two personalities. However, the one person that really took over the show was Guy Pearce. Not only was he ruthlessly unlikeable, the last scene with Jones was perfect. The only thing I didn't like was the rather predictable twists that involved the hands of a few smarmy characters and the eventual exoneration. A good popcorn thriller to watch and keep you interested, but don't expect something deep and powerful.",7,0,1,9 January 2003
Pi," My inspiration
","Granted, Pi may not be the best film ever created, but one can admire the audacity of such a project. Before this movie, I never thought mathematics could ever be portrayed in an interesting manner. I pray Darren Aronofsky doesn't fly the route of some Hollywood hack like Tony Scott or Joel Schumacher. This is a film I'll always remember. Even if my own movie never receives a lick of critical praise, this film will always be my personal inspiration.",8,0,1,11 April 2002
Children of Men," The Breakdown of Humanity
","The human race tends to believe that it will endure on, that our power to reproduce as much as we please will never cease. This is why Childdren of Men is so fascinating. The movie rarely pulls any punches on the heady topic of infertility, illustrating the wild panic and cynicism that would most likely overtake the populace.Children of Men also produces an interesting quandary on the human condition. No matter what happens to us in the future, all of the last remaining vestiges of current society-greed, paranoia, racism, etc.-will never cease to die. I felt that was the boldest step in the film. Those that had the money were hanging onto their pathetic dreams of wealth and status while the world slowly decayed from the inside out.I felt all of the performances in the film were quite amazing, and the lack of flash and panache from the cinematography aided in keeping you focused on the story and not the way it looked. Once again, Alfonso Cuaron has helped establish the power shift in creativity is coming from Mexico. Cuaron, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (Babel) and Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth) have provided the best cluster of Mexican-made films since Mexicos Golden Age of Cinema in the 1940s and 50s. Go and see this film, and you won't be disappointed.",10,2,5,19 March 2007
Garden State," Vastly overrated
","For those that might send me nasty e-mails, shove it. There is a trend in Hollywood where those that create overly-quirky movies are instantly impervious to criticism. Garden State tends to be one of those movies. Sure, Zach Braff, star of a rather overrated sitcom, surprises people with some talent behind the camera, but that doesn't warrant the kind of praise that a film like this has been receiving. The story is often times too thin and shallow to provide any real insight. People have compared this film to The Graduate, but those type of people are the types that try to oversell independent cinema. Indie films are subject to the same hit and miss mentality that typically hits the studio films, but people seemed to have forgotten that there are far more bad indie films than good ones. Garden State isn't atrocious, but its isn't great.First off, the film is too quick, resulting in a rather fast reemergence of Large into his former life. After ten years, people tend to act like he never left. Where's the awkwardness? Of course, the situation is always solved by a quick drug tasting scene (which I will say was portrayed rather accurately). The film seem to present a lot of emotional inequities, giving us the idea that the emotion will come up later in a more deeper and more well thought out way. However, it fails to deliver on those fronts, leaving us wondering why the journey to some of his decisions and moments were quickly resolved (like Peter Saarsgard's grave robbing tendencies). It wasn't completely abysmal, but maybe we should stop praising the film as something it isn't.",1,82,158,27 August 2004
Event Horizon," A good mix of horror and sci-fi
","This film was a lot better than what most people gave it credit for. The cinematography was excellent, and the lighting gave the film a very eerie feel to it. Certainly better than the average sci-fi film. Not only did the film mix two mediums almost perfectly (sci-fi and horror), it completed the union almost flawlessly. Not a perfect movie, but then again, Sam Neill was amazing in this film. Virtually all of the technical aspects in the film were top-notch. While it didn't advance the film industry overall, it did make an impact in the sci-fi genre.",7,225,303,7 May 2002
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," A sad, poorly made sequel
","They had a hit with the first movie! It was actually good! But did they decided to build off the tension and intrigue: No! RE2 proved to be another in the long line of tired sequels, a killshot to the head and to the hearts of those that liked the original. Maybe Paul W.S. Anderson should have directed this movie (of then again, maybe not: AVP stunk). The energy, the darkness, the distinct flavor of the first film were no where to be seen, for instead, they were replaced with random action sequences and useless dialogue. That was just one of the many downfalls of the entire movie. It was all action, no suspense. It was completely contradictory to the first movie, even if it is following the games scripts more closely than ever. However, cannibalization of a lot of good ideas shouldn't be set aside to help bolster the street cred with those that play the game. In all, this movie needed a major overhaul, and no one seems to be up to the task to keep this franchise moving.",4,2,6,29 September 2004
8 Mile," Better than what I expected, even with Eminem as the lead
","Eminem stars in a film about a white rapper trying to cut it in a black dominated musical genre and eventually comes out on a top. Hmmm, did Scott Silver really think this was an original idea? Well, beyond that, this film actually proved to be rather satisfying, presenting an image of rap and the hip-hop aesthetic in a cinematic format as opposed to high-gloss exploitation like The Players Club or All About the Benjamins. Eminem's frequent outbursts seemed too many and too quick, but his acting style was fairly consistent with the rather static character he sought to portray. If Rap wants to be taken more seriously for its style and impact, then they should follow the lead of this film. While the film is not without its problems, it is a much better alternative than some of the other hip-hop schlock that has been released in recent years.",7,0,1,10 November 2002
Black Hawk Down," War at its grittiest and most breath taking
","For roughly 80 minutes of this film, I have never seen this much action, weapons and deaths depicted so emphatically. Ridley Scott made a gem of a film, one that is powerful in its imagery than its dialogue and other aspects. This proves to be one of the few films with bad dialogue I actually liked, simply because of the detail and care placed onto the technical side of the film. The cinematography was quite stunning, even though it was thinly guised as your typical action-movie cinematography. While I felt Josh Hartnett was WAYYY out of his element, the other actors were all exceptional. Ewan McGregor and Ewan Bremner, both known as the druggies from Trainspotting, were quite convincing in their roles as Army Rangers. Tom Sizemore proved he is the ultimate bad ass when it comes to war movies, and the likes of William Fichtner, Eric Bana and Sam Shepard proved to be worthy background characters. The best war film to come out since The Thin Red Line.",8,0,1,21 May 2002
Rudy," Today's spoiled athletes should take notes
","One of my favorite football movies of all time, this film follows in the long tradition of great sports movies which can uplift the spirit through means other than winning the big game and getting the girl or some other typical Hollywood convention. The music, cinematography and acting was excellent in this film, especially considering the terrible film choices Sean Astin had before embarking on this movie. While this was really an homage to Notre Dame football, a person could really look at Rudy and see a little of themselves inside the relatively small man. Charles Dutton had one of the greatest speeches in the history of sports cinema, and he should have gained more notoriety for his performance in this film.",8,43,53,8 June 2002
The Insider," The movie that should have won the best picture Oscar among the movies nominated
","While Fight Club was the best movie from 1999, The Insider should have won the Oscar among the films nominated. Instead, they passed the award to the completely undeserving American Beauty. Russell Crowe shined as the tortured Wigand, even though the man in real life was actually kind of light hearted. I listened to him speak when he made a rare appearance in Tucson, displaying a persona that seemed far from the one portrayed in the movie. Al Pacino was probably the hippest news producer ever, and the film was most certainly a classic.Hopefully, people will give this film the respect it most certainly deserves.",10,0,1,17 April 2002
Annie Hall," The best Woody Allen film to date
","Up until watching this movie, I never cared much about Woody Allen and his prestigious career. However, his sarcastic wit and paranoid delusions really snared me, and I have come to enjoy his films as of late. Annie Hall stands as one of my favorite comedies of all time, especially when the little kid says `I'm a methadone addict.' Brilliant, and worth multiple viewings, this film puts the idea of postmodern filmmaking into a new realm of understanding and enlightenment. I can't get enough of Alvie in this film, and hopefully, no one else can either.",10,1,2,14 May 2002
Men in Black," Good quirky fun
","With Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith leading the way, this proved to be a rather entertaining movie about a secret alien society. Granted, true followers of the men in black know this stylized version of the secret organization is not true, but it is still interesting to watch. While I have never cared much for Barry Sonnenfeld's body of work, his fast paced cinematography works hand in hand with this movie, moving the viewer along at a pace which keeps them interested all throughout. Also, the creature effects were top notch, which I feel was the real scene stealer in the film. Tommy Lee Jones was exceptional, but Will Smith proved to be mostly annoying. Overall, the oddball nature of the film was rather satisfying.",7,1,1,3 July 2002
The Mummy Returns," Worse than the first
","I didn't think it was humanly possibly to make a film as bad as The Mummy, but Hollywood never ceases to amaze me. I remember everyone I knew like this movie, yet I was still apprehensive. I'm just glad I watched it for free, so I had no part in funding this crap-fest. The funny thing is, so much money was spent on making this film, they still couldn't create some decent CGI. A step backward in the action genre if you ask me.",1,0,2,16 April 2002
Grindhouse," A Big Pile of Suck-ass
","Clearly, there is a propaganda conspiracy running amuck in regards to the idea of people walking out of this film. The official explanation is the fact people weren't savvy enough to pick up on the whole '2 movies within a movie' idea Tranatino and Rodriguez were trying to convey. I think it is something more simple: this movie just plain stunk.Once you dip through all of the pretentious irony, you realize the product you're watching is quite substandard. When the fake trailers for the real film are far more entertaining than the movie itself, then its pretty obvious that something was wrong in the film-making process. I think it was just the fact that no one could say no to Tarantino or Rodriguez, that no one had the guts to say 'This movie blows' even with the supposed irony in check. Tarantino's career has somewhat been overrated, holding a very hit and miss mentality. Where Kill Bill I and Pulp Ficiton succeeded, KB 2, Jackie Brown and Reservoir Dogs all kind of flopped. Throw in his magnanimous Deathproof to the crummy pile.Rodriguez's Planet Terror did have some elements to it that were absolutely hilarious, but even then, it just felt like it was dragging. Rodriguez should have cut himself away from Tarantino and put more work into the faux-movie 'Machete', which is based on a character he wrote in the Spy Kids franchises (though much nicer). It would have made a better grindhouse-style film than Planet Terror. Rodriguez will thankfully return to form in Sin City 2, but he needs to drop the dead weight and ego that is Tarantino. His career can be salvaged at this point. As for Deathproof, there's a reason why many people left this stinker. The car chases were fine, but we don't want to hear endless streams of mindless 'Lifetime' style dialog when we could be witnessing some more carnage from Stuntman Mike. During my showing, half the theater left in the middle of this clunker, and they knew exactly what they were getting into. The ultimate betrayal was at the end, when Mike was revealed as more of a coward than a bloodthirsty maniac. That alone kind of takes away the whole idea of the Grindhouse movie. A bad guy with a conscience? This is just another example that Kill Bill I may be the last good movie we'll get out of Tarantino, and frankly, this is probably a shot in the arm for humanity. I've always complained we need to stop praising bad films, this is certainly one of them.",1,17,40,16 April 2007
The Last Samurai," One of those films that deserved better
","To see The Last Samurai slip into oblivion is quite a joke. Hollywood's hatred toward Tom Cruise came to a head with this film. I'm not saying Tom Cruise is a great actor, but to deny him in a film where he certainly earned some accolades is a disgrace.First of all, The Last Samurai is formulaic, which means all of the other elements involved in making a film must be tight and perfected. The music, the cinematography and the acting all fell into place, giving the film a certain richness that helped set it apart from the multitude of films that precluded it. The Last Samurai was much better than Cold Mountain or Master and Commander, which to say many people were turned off by the idea of Cruise leading a serious ensemble without explosions and car chases to back up his dialogue. Give the man some credit where it is due. Every dog has his day, and this was certainly it. The first time I watched this film, I was surprised by the amount of talent that went into making this film. John Toll (director of photography), Ed Zwick, and Hans Zimmer all layed their signature groundwork, making this a memorable film. In the annals of remembrance, The Last Samurai will certainly have better staying power than Master and Commander or Cold Mountain, and it will just become another one of those 'should-of-beens.'",9,1,2,28 September 2004
A Clockwork Orange," One of those films you have to watch multiple times
","It's hard to judge a film such as this. Its cold and hard, yet can be exhilarating and sarcastic. It can be average, yet it can be visionary. Exploitive? Satirical? Too many questions to consider when one watches this film.Even after 34 years, this film still speaks volumes about our current culture, which many ideals are ringing true today. The younger generations are out of control due to lack of parental control, junk culture is becoming commonplace, violence is desensitizing the masses, and we all seem to be enjoying the ride on the way down. It's very difficult to find movies which can make such startling commentary, yet hold on to such accusations for an extended period of time. Nowadays, films are focused-grouped to death, conformity is more powerful than artistry, and money is far more important than quality. Kubrick took a huge leap with this film, challenging society to take a hard look at itself. Unfortunately, society wasn't ready for this film, which is why it is revered now more than ever.",10,646,854,28 April 2002
Groundhog Day," A delectable consortium of comedy and social commentary
","This is easily the best movie Bill Murray has ever graved. From the tongue in cheek mannerisms of his character to the hilarious story. But this film also brings up a situation which some may not wish to have. How does one seek to change their ways in a world devoid of such commonalities? Quite a head trip when one really looks deeply into the concept. Murray fully delved into the horrendous nature of self gratification. Once Murray turned into a man who could be a caring an warm individual, his world finally changed. Makes you wish such a predicament could fall on other individuals in need of an attitude adjustment.",9,5,10,16 May 2002
Total Recall," Classic Verhoeven
","One of the best mind trips ever, I could only wish this movies was made ten years later. Even for 1990, this film had some of the most imaginative make-up I've ever seen in a movie. While it had Paul Verhoeven's classic shallowness, the film really touched new ground not only with science fiction but also with special effects. Talk a good few years for a director, he not only changed sci-fi with Robocop, he did it again with Total Recall. Verhoeven will never, ever win an Oscar for best director, but his movies will at least be entertaining in most respects.",7,99,147,21 June 2002
Rocky," One of the best boxing films ever
","Despite the rushed nature of the filming process, this film still ranks as a very satisfying movie experience. Sylvester Stallone seemed destined to play the role of a down on his luck boxer. While the dialogue seemed to be made up on the spot at many points, the depth of the characters made up for such shortfalls. Rocky isn't just about some guy getting the shot of a lifetime, it's about the conquering spirit which seems to be inside each and every person, whether they believe it or not. While Rocky engages in somewhat shady practices, he embodies a person that seems to be stuck in time, forever caught up in a moment he can't seem to shake off. While some may dispute this film as the best of 1976, one cannot deny the power and new ground it broke. Instead of being the typical sports-feel-good-movie, it was more about Rocky simply showing the world he can do something more than just be a manual laborer. An awesome film to say the least.",8,1,1,8 June 2002
Eyes Wide Shut," Icey Eroticism from the mind of Kubrick
","Stanley Kubrick's last film proved to be one of his chilliest. While some might label the erotica in the film as hot and steamy, Kubrick managed to make naked women and animal lust feel cold and isolated. From the opening cut to the last line uttered by Nicole Kidman, this will be one of those films that will be simply labeled a `Kubrick film.' While it saddens me to think this was his last film, at least I got to watch this one in a theater. With the exception of this film and Full Metal Jacket, I have never seen any of Kubrick's previous film in a larger than life fashion. While the pacing was a little slow, even for Kubrick, I really felt the dialogue was strange and unique. Coupled with some great camera movements and music, everything is put together evenly over the run of the film. It may have been a long two and half year wait, but at least Kubrick's swan song isn't something to be completely embarrassed about.",8,0,1,8 August 2002
The Descent," Good film with a good premise
","With a formula like this, The Descent was guaranteed to be a decent film. Attractive women + decent scares + creepy cave = lots of good scares.I'll admit, the film wasn't terribly scary, but the tension that was all throughout the film did feel real. This was the reason why this film doesn't get a higher rating. While gore and violence makes for good movies, it doesn't really help in the horror genre. But the real triumph with this film was the great make-up, and not just for the creatures. When you saw the compound fracture, you were genuinely grossed out. Even the blood looked real.All in all, this film was really nothing more than a popcorn munching showcase. Sometimes the action near the end of the film was almost ludicrous to the point of being funny. But then again, that doesn't mean the film was unwatchable.",7,1,3,14 August 2006
Hoosiers," The epitome of small time lunacy
","While some regard this is an endearing epithet to the hunger of Indiana basketball, it seems to make fun of the madness which surrounds the sport in the little Midwestern state. While the story seemed hackneyed and disbelieving, one has to look at the power of the film as opposed to the technical aspects. While Hoosiers is virtually every basketball fan's perfect movie, it is one that really encompasses the spirit of fortitude, much in the same way Rocky I did.",8,0,2,8 June 2002
Titanic," I seem to be the only who hated this poor excuse of a film
","Titanic opened on the day of birth, and my birthdays have progressively gotten worse since that day. To me, Titanic presents a myriad of raw anger and spite. I could bash this movie for years. and my insults would never cease. From the improbable story line, to the putrid acting performance by Leo has made this movie a bane of existence.One would say I'm nothing but a bitter person, but such insinuations could be further from the truth. If I had enough guts, I would burn every last print in existence. No one is going to remember this film except for the fact they spent 20 bucks to buy a crummy movie which has spurned equally dull films of the same formula (the Green Mile, Pearl Harbor, and many more to come).I just have one big question for all of the idiots who voted for the Academy Awards for the year 1997. What were you thinking?!! How could you not choose L.A. Confidential or Good Will Hunting. Another reason why the Oscars will always disappoint me. I will say this: The Lord of the Rings opened on my birthday as well (hopefully, the curse is broken)",1,6,15,11 April 2002
Rocky III," Mr. T at his best!
","Like all cheesy multi-sequel series, the third movie always had to be some gimmick. How about tossing in Hulk Hogan and Mr. T as villains. This seemed like one big gimmick, like they made this film to simply satisfy the masses. While it was decent in many respects, it really leads one to wonder why a person would ruin a good thing with overkill.",7,0,2,8 June 2002
The Untouchables," Quite a delight
","Brian De Palma's grandest work of film was all culminated in this stark and engrossing film about Prohibition, a time of real gangsters and miscreants. Well, shot and acted, looking at this cast list from a point of hindsight is what makes this film so spectacular to watch. One thing I truly appreciated was Robert De Niro's engaging performance as Al Capone. To heck with Marlon Brando in The Godfather. While the film does have a very Hollywoodesque feel to it, the pacing and the story tend to help you forget that this film was made to cater to Oscar voters. This is one of my favorite De Palma films, and I'll always consider him a good director due to the vision and heart he put into this production.",8,0,1,9 November 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," At times wobbly and pretentious, but still cool to look at
","(SPOILERS WITHIN)The Matrix Reloaded was everything that the first movie was in regards to technical make-up and 'wow' factor, but it felt a little hollow at some points. I think the reason is the overload on dialogue in some portions, especially the end and the confrontation between Neo and Agent Smith in the middle of the film. It just needed to be punchier.However, such a detail can be overlooked when the special effects are considered. While everything was typical of the first film, two moments in this film made it light-years better. The one continuous shot after Neo grabs the sign pole is simply amazing, making the whole concept of Bullet-Time from the first movie seem tired and obsolete. Then of course, the bullet-time shot of the exploding riggs was quite awesome.Special effects aside, Revolutions has a lot to live up to, especially since Reloaded was clearly just a transition.",8,0,0,20 May 2003
A Beautiful Mind," A good movie, but not the best of 2001
","Despite all of the inconsistencies and Disney-fication of John Nash's life, this was really a satisfying film to watch. The whole mental illness aspect of his life really took me by surprise, simply because I had not read any literature about the movie. While this film is excellent in most technical aspects (and Crowe's performance was certainly beautiful, even if he can't do a southern accent worth a lick), it just didn't feel like the worthiest film nominated for Best Picture. Memento, Lord of the Rings and Blackhawk Down were far superior movies to come out in 2001, it just shows what a little creative public relations work can do for a film.",8,0,2,26 May 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Better than the first
","While I despised the first Harry Potter movie, this one proved to be much more engaging and better made than its predecessor. The kids obviously look more polished in this film, having actually learned something from the rather pitiful Chris Columbus. For posterity's sake, I'll give this film a 7/10 merely fro the fact that the special effects didn't look tacked on and the performances were much more grounded and realistic. All I can though, is we need more of the Weasleys! Just looking at them as a family is a hoot! Oh well, I'm rambling.",7,0,0,28 January 2003
Glory Road," Entertaining, but not creative
","There's a very obvious label that typically comes with a Jerry Bruckheimer production: enter at your own risk. With this very cut and dry mantra in place, Glory Road tends to be one of those many misses. Granted it's not like a Bad Boys 2 or a Kangaroo Jack in its badness, but it covers up its ineptitude with schmaltzy moments of saccharine a la Remember the Titans. Fortunately, this only happens in the first half of the movie.While we get stuck in the usual merry-go-round of sports movie paradigms, the second half of the film takes on a personality of its own. While the racial in fighting between the team members have been verified as false, it provides an interesting allegory about the times they played in. Coach Don Haskins has also stated his intentions weren't about bucking the system, this was the angle that was placed upon the viewer.What do wish is they had made this movie with a more serious tone to it, much like the second half of the movie. I felt the story would have been more powerful and maybe an Oscar worthy film. Unfortunately, we'll have to stick with this version for the moment until a true sports movie dumps the usual plot points.",7,3,13,23 January 2006
Die Hard," Great action flick
","Bruce Willis demonstrated how talented and funny he could be, giving us an action star with an unmistakable dry wit and machismo so many action characters seem to lack. While some might call this film a little low-brow, but its intention was to never be smart and engaging. I've rarely enjoyed films simply for being fun and entertaining, but this film has always held a certain respect in my heart. Let's just say, this will be one of my exceptions to art and elegance.",8,1,3,15 May 2002
War of the Worlds," A sometimes tense, yet poorly executed piece
","Steven Spielberg's name has more or less become quite kitsch over the last few years, but you can always credit him for making a film that was well put together and constructed. War of the Worlds will most likely be considered a blip on his resume due to the fact he couldn't follow that example.There were moments where it looked like this film would become a great movie, but the sloppiness of the production was quite apparent. This was a money-maker, and it didn't matter what happened as long as they got their money in return. While the effects and Janusz Kaminski's cinematography were pretty on par, other elements like the script and the acting were too much to overcome. Tom Cruise didn't have to act much in this film, but he lacked any real range of emotions. His lack of character seemed to be apparent within the film, something that falls on all of the characters, especially Robbie, who is played by Justin Chatwin. David Koepp, who wrote a rather beguiling script that was high on concept and low on meaning, seems to be stumbling a lot these days considering his last few scripts have been trite and lacking real depth. What really saved this film was the special effects and the sound editing, which was expected. The walking machines were faithfully reproduced unlike the original film, satisfying more hardcore fans of the book (like myself). War of the Worlds will get its share of mixed reviews, and that's to be expected considering how bi-polar the film gets. Is it anti-war? Is it pro-family? Is it about community or looking out for No. 1? Just when you think it will go one way, it goes the other.",6,2,6,1 July 2005
All Quiet on the Western Front," One for the ages
","It's difficult to compare an old war film with the more technological features we have today, but All Quiet on the Western Front still hold up today. Granted, some might say the battle scenes are chintsy, but then again, one has to remember this film was made in 1930, when film was still getting used to the idea of using synchronized sound. I still believe this film could be remade, but unless someone is willing to keep the beauty and the revelry of the original film, then it shouldn't.This film will always remain one of my favorite war films.",10,2,3,23 April 2002
There Will Be Blood," A grand old Epic with modern touches
","Call it socialist, anti-religion, anti-capitalist----whatever. There Will Be Blood is truly the best movie to come out in a long time. Its a rarity to see a film take a huge leap with such a stunning indictment on not one, but two relevant institutions in current society. And it is done so in a solid and deliberate manner which fully illustrates the madness that is created by hate and greed.There Will Be Blood hardly pulls any punches. Greed consumes all. The hopeful heart is easily manipulated. The quest for pomposity blackens the heart. Family is only relevant in comparison to the mighty dollar. There are all lessons that humanity must battle everyday, and Paul Thomas Anderson throws all of these struggles onto the shoulders of two men, Daniel Plainview and Eli Sunday. Both are manipulative, both talk of grander, more majestic worlds that stir the imagination, and both would seek untold riches at any cost. Its an interesting battle that the pair have for much of the film, fighting to gain a leg up on each other but also playing with the hearts and minds of those they directly affect. Some might call this a direct attack on the oil industry and Evangelical Christians, but the movie merely depicts both areas for what they truly---corruptible, just like everything else. Its a relatively fair statement, considering both Palinview and Sunday are much different and far more idealistic in their earlier depictions in the film.Anderson's visual work was also quite astonishing, making the bleak landscapes a character unto themselves. He also made the movie work with a relatively unknown cast of actors, which gave the film so much more depth in its characters because you could believe them. Paul Dano's whiny Eli Sunday was a perfect juxtaposition to Daniel Day Lewis' Daniel Plainview. One uses his anger and hatred for power while the other uses manipulation and ignorance. And the even more interesting thing is that both statements could apply to either character.There Will Be Blood is easily the best movie of 2007, much less of any decade. Go and watch it.",10,1,10,24 January 2008
Ice Age," Make way for Ice Age!
","While the animation was sometimes corny (especially the humans), the dialogue between the characters was entertaining and sarcastic to say the least. Ray Romano fully embodied the bitter Manfred, and John Leguizamo's slobbery voice fit in nicely with Sid's persona. Denis Leary was also a standout, making his presence felt even though his character wasn't meant for comic relief. A funny, solid film that doesn't last too long (only 81 minutes) and doesn't overdo any jokes. While the story turned out to be predictable, the little interludes with Scrat were rather entertaining.",8,2,4,21 May 2002
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Jack Nicholson at his finest
","It's tough to really judge this movie. Is it Milos Forman's greatest directorial masterpiece or Jack Nicholson's best performance. Tough to say, but the marriage between both director and actor are quite phenomenal. From the first time we see Jack Nicholson to the sad, yet uplifting ending, one cannot escape the sheer power of the film. When a film is parodied as many times as this one has been, typically, greatness can be associated. Well, greatness was achieved, and let's hope this one never falls through the cracks.",9,166,222,13 August 2002
Scream 2," Why? A pointless addition
","The only part I liked in this movie was the fact Jada Pinkett-Smith got killed. I can't stand that woman! Nonetheless, this film proved to be rather hoo-hah, considering the plot just up and disappeared. I mean, Timothy Olyphant and the lady from Roseanne as the two culprits. God, what a joke! I couldn't stop laughing over the silly curveball thrown at me. The only performance I enjoyed in the film was Liev Streiber. Why isn't this guy getting more roles? Anyway, Neve Campbell was ravishing to say the least.",6,0,1,5 May 2002
Die Hard with a Vengeance," A solid swan song to a great series
","While some dogged this film for being overkill, I really liked the change in atmosphere and technical construction. The cinematography was jarring, but effective in many ways which were not demonstrated in the first two films. Jeremy Irons was exceptional as a villain, but let's just say he won't be portraying any Southerners any time soon. Let's just say, that accent he used was downright terrible. Whoever the accent coach was in this film should consider a career change. Anyway, the film was very tension packed, especially when Willis and Samuel L. Jackson were sent on a wild good chase. A solid effort, but it will always be considered the least profitable in the series.",7,1,2,15 May 2002
The Waterboy," Forrest Gumpian paradigm meets Adam Sandler
","While Forrest Gump was beautiful and powerful, this film proved to take on the opposite spectrum with a mentally ill character. Sure, a lot of the humor is bathroom-type and vulgar, the whole zero-to-hero concept is really taken on in a humorous way. No matter how many times I have watched this movie, I still laugh at the jokes. Lawrence Taylor's cameo couldn't have come at a funnier time, especially coming off his cocaine possession charges. While I did find it odd that Kathy Bates and Henry Winkler were in this film, they both filled the roles rather nicely. One of my favorite football movies, with plenty of laughs for everyone.",7,1,2,1 July 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," Beautiful and captivating
","Few movies can grab the soul like this one. For me, every time I watch The Shawshank Redemption, I remember the music. I remember the framing, how each scene is perfectly constructed and put together, displaying the lives of the criminals. Every oily moment with the warden, every frightening vision with the `Sisters,' and of course, every point of pontification by the venerable Andy Dufresne. While I do not consider this the greatest movie ever, it is awfully close o the top. The performances by the likes of Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Clancy Brown (who was doing Dr. Pepper commercials at the time) and Bob Gunton as Warden Norton were all exceptional. One thing that always keeps me coming back is the score by Thomas Newman. While he has based his entire style off this memorable score (listen to The Road to Perdition and Shawshank back to back, and you'll see), the subtle movements and piano keys turn this into one of the best films of all time.",10,0,2,13 August 2002
Platoon," Excellent look at Vietnam
","This certainly rates as one of the best Vietnam films of all time. What I especially enjoyed was the realistic atmosphere of the film, entrenching the viewer into a world which seems surreal yet believable. Oliver Stone's real-life experience in Vietnam brought a gifted outlook to this film, one drawn by experience, not common Hollywood conventions. While this proved be a lesser film to the equally amazing Full Metal Jacket, it was not by much. The performances by Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, Charlie Sheen and John C. McGinley were exceptional, capturing the plight of the tortured soldiers.",8,67,101,15 May 2002
Scream," An interesting film to say the least
","When I first watched this film, I was really surprised how spectacular it was. A film which spurs multiple cast-offs and parodies must be decent, right? I loved the characters, especially Sidney and Jamie Kennedy's character. It's a great little addition to the horror genre, and it will stand as a milestone for quite a while.",7,0,0,5 May 2002
Back to the Future Part II," Could have been better, but they missed the attack
","Sometimes, the need for being different doesn't quite equate onto the movie screen. While the jumping back and forth was a rather intriguing idea, the execution was too quick and herky-jerky. However, I did find the different parrellels rather funny and interesting, especially the future world of 2015. But what was really good about this film was the unlimited number of paradoxes that infiltrated the film. While this one paled in comparison to the original, at least it was enjoyable to watch.",7,13,26,19 March 2003
Shrek," A rather flat film with its moments
","While this was a decent film, I still can't put my finger on why I felt it was so average. Granted, some of the humor was littered with double entendres, it just didn't suit me. Maybe it was just the plot being a little too thin or the fact Shrek was a pretty one-sided character until the very end. I did like Eddie Murphy in his role as the donkey, but other than that, the film just didn't strike a chord with me. Solid, but not memorable.",7,0,0,21 May 2002
The Silence of the Lambs," A good movie, but still lacks in some parts
","While this film was great, it still pales in comparison to the vastly superior SE7EN. What I did enjoy about this film was the exceptional use of light and the sets. However, the bad guy proved to be one of the lamest excuses for a villain ever. Not only was he ridiculous, his intentions were revealed too early, making the suspense of his evil far too easy to comprehend. While I will say the characters were interesting, the overall scope of the film was muddled. What was supposed to be scary proved to be lacking. Anthony Hopkins was good in the film, but much like the villain, his evil was too caricaturized to make him evil. The direction was exceptional, and Jodie Foster was good, but little else seemed to impress me.",8,0,1,23 July 2002
Vanilla Sky," Better than I expected, considering how bad the trailer was for it
","-contains spoilers-Quite honestly, I was surprised by this film. For some odd reason, Tom Cruise keeps displaying the semblance of acting ability. While Penelope Cruz felt awkward and sometimes out of place, her presence in the film brought an interesting contrast between her and Cameron Diaz. The grounded and self actualized brunette versus the out of touch and promiscuous blonde. Score one for the lovely brunettes of the world! Anyway, the dialogue gave up too much of the ending too early in the film. In my opinion, if the screen writer had made the messages more subtle and cryptic, this would certainly would be a classic in the sense of The Crying Game or The Sixth Sense. Also, I must commend John Toll for his amazing photography. I didn't even recognize his work in the fast paced world of within this film. And one last note, the music, cinematography and the action was amazing at the end of the film when Cruise finally makes his leap of faith.",7,0,0,9 May 2002
Any Given Sunday," Sports in its most brutal moments
","Wild and outrageous, Any Given Sunday gives the viewer a glimpse into an athletic world not too far from the real thing. While some of the scenes were a little too over the top, it proved to be a very enjoyable experience. As a major football fan, I was disappointed in the fact the NFL did not allow Stone to use their logos and stadiums. Oh well, I seemed to enjoy the fictional league even better, even if some of the team uniforms were a dreadful. Jamie Fox portrayed Willie Beamon perfectly, epitomizing the selfish athlete with a cultured ease. While the speed of Beamon's rise proved to be a little too quick, the message in the rise and fall of stardom was more poignant than anything.",7,26,35,15 May 2002
Tombstone," A great modern Western
","Having lived so close to the actual town of Tombstone for many years and having visited the town many times, I always felt a connection to the movie. Its a bit humbling to see the land that is now covered with asphalt and wood portrayed in a manner that seems rustic and untainted. I've always loved the classic Westerns, and this one seems head and shoulders above the rest.While some people still dispute the validity of the film's self-proclaimed 'authentic' tag, it still remains one of the best westerns ever. It will never age poorly, simply due to the mix of modern day aesthetics and rustic ambiance. All of he characters were presented with an arc all their own, firmly infused within the film's texture. Though not the greatest film of all time, its one I'll always watch whole-heartedly.",8,0,0,5 May 2002
Blade Runner," An SF gift from Ridley Scott
","What can I possibly say about one of the most profound noir/sci-fi films ever made? What can I say about a stylistic approach that has been mimicked and cloned many, many times? Bladerunner has been a film which has defied critics and made believers to those who have never seen the movie. Sci-fi would still be a cheesy Dr. Who/BuckRogers/Xanadu cheesefest without the genius of Ridley Scott. Not only did he strike chords with Alien, he did it again in Bladerunner, redefining four genres in the process. While Harrison Ford might have been a weird choice to play Deckard, it worked out beautifully. While I am a fan of both the book and the movie, I felt this film really strived to establish a difference between the two mediums. While the book was dense and detail packed, the film did its best to fluidly portray the images Phillip K. Dick created so many years ago. Coupled with some great editing (the director's cut was far better) and a wonderful score by Vangelis, this film will stand as one of the best sci-fi films ever.",10,0,1,8 August 2002
Bruce Almighty," Brings up some interesting questions, and is funny too!
","Sure, Jim Carrey nearly ruined his career with The Majestic, but he returns to form with this great comedy. It also posed the inevitable question: What if Jim Carrey was God? This should have been a horror film, but that's for another movie. Nonetheless. Carrey's inexorable physical humor made this film what is is, a sweet little comedy that doesn't get too preachy. While I wanted more to happen in the last 15 minutes of the film, one can't complain about the rest of the film. To say the least, it was pure comic genius, and for all of the religious nutbags who claim this film is sacreligious should lighten up. This is nothing more than a popcorn movie with enough great visuals and plot to keep you entertained.",7,1,3,24 May 2003
Trainspotting," A great film for anyone
","In what can be described as one of the best movies to come out of Britain, Danny Boyle directed a film which will stand on its own for quite a long time. With a strong cast to back up the tongue in cheek dialogue, this film takes on another view of friendship unlike his previous work, Shallow Grave. Ewan McGregor was excellent as the troubled and weak Renton, giving us both a tragic hero, yet one with vices that tend to control him. Overall, I felt the story was very strong, and the other actors (Ewan Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller, Robert Carlyle, Kevin McKidd and Kelly MacDonald) brought in a rather quirky and dysfunctional backdrop to Renton's troubles. One of the best anti-drug movies of all time, hopefully this is one which will be remembered for years to come.",9,2,3,9 July 2002
Signs," Suspense with a twist of science fiction
","From the opening shot to the very last, Signs takes you on a trip that creeps into your subconscious, instilling actual fear into your heart instead of creating bad sound effects to instill terror. While M. Night Shyamalan has yet to top The Sixth Sense, this is easily his second best film, making a movie packed with suspense and imagination unlike recent horror flicks. Overall, the film as a whole is quite good. With the exception of some nitpicky details within the film (like the ending and the boffo alien make-up), this stands as one of the cooler films to come out this summer, if not the coolest. Mel Gibson's portrayal as a tortured ex-reverend is wonderfully portrayed, especially moments where his faith is put deeply into doubt. I would most likely watch this film again, for too few films this summer could carry that distinction.What I especially enjoyed about this film was the relatively fast pace. While Shyamalan's films have been notorious for being painfully slow due to the lack of editing, this film moves along to a different tempo. I also give kudos to the sound department, who excelled mightily in establishing mood and tension through the simple sounds of footsteps and creaking floors. This also was a change of pace for Shyamalan in regards to pacing. Instead of waiting for a good forty minutes to introduce us to the gist of the story, we get a look at the aliens right away, making the viewer long for more.",8,0,2,2 August 2002
Identity," This film needs to figure out what it wants to be
","I will say off the top, Identity is a decent film that was well put together and is worth the price of admission. However, the film tends to take on too many personas in the process, concluding in a explosion of different genres and styles. While the film did have some very interesting ideas, it tried cramming too many within the 90-minute run time. Maybe if they had stayed on one straight line, it would have garnered an 8/10 from me. However, the film is worth seeing, but I would call it more a thriller than a horror film.",7,0,1,25 April 2003
Speed," A film for all people from Tucson to see!
","Bad one-liners, stupid characters, a crackpot bad-guy, Keanu Reeves, a paper thin plot, a ridiculous bridge jump scene.........WHAT A GREAT MOVIE! Sometimes, the ridiculousness of film outweighs the brilliance, and Speed proves such a theory. The entire movie was hillarious. How the heck could one take this film seriously! Granted, the action was great and everything, but it just felt like some bad, live-action japanimation cartoon on crack. Read the memorable quotes section on this page, and you'll instantly understand the profound idiocy placed into this film. Also, for any person from Tucson, this is a must see. (there's a bunch of University of Arizona references, mostly hillarious)",7,0,5,2 May 2002
Amélie," A beautifully exceptional film
","Amelie is one of those rare chick flicks that I can honestly and proudly say I enjoyed. But then again, this film is really more than a movie about love and desire, but it's a movie that seems to touch a chord within us all, baring a bit of our souls in ways that is rarely done in cinema. You can't help but fall in love with Amelie. Her innocence is not contrived and her love is something that needs to be tapped. Jean-Pierre Jeunet created a masterpiece with this vivid and beautiful film. His famous attention to detail and his desire to make a technically perfect movie is something film school students should take note of. His ability to make a heart warming story but keep it devoid of any sap or saccharine was the true mark of this brilliant film. Each scene must have been a canvas to Jeunet, and the beauty of France is portrayed perfectly in this film. Years from now, people will understand the greatness of this movie for what it is instead of looking at it as yet another foreign film. For those that look past subtitles and boring, retreaded action movie paradigms, this movie will be a gem.",10,3,8,20 August 2006
The Sixth Sense," A whip-smart thriller that delivers
","After hearing the hype of this film for so long before it released, I was happy to say I was satisfied with the outcome of this film. While the obvious attempts at trying to cause reactions were a little silly, the true terror was achieved in watching the reactions of the main characters. Wonderfully paced and conceived, I had not seen this kind of secrecy over the ending of a film since The Crying Game (which was equally frightening). Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment proved to be excellent together on the screen, making their budding friendship seem real and believable. While I felt this wasn't the best film from 1999, it proved to be one of the better films to come out in years.",9,0,0,8 August 2002
Final Destination," Intense film by former minions of the X-Files
","Eerie, spine tingling and different, Final Destination proved to be one of those horror movies that didn't try to sell itself as a pure horror film. Throw in some intrigue and a ton of tension, and this film clearly brought a unique perspective on the horror genre. With a genre in decay, Final Destination really brought something different to the table. Unpredictable and breathtakingly sharp, the modes of death made you want to hide in your room for a long time. The acting was fair, but it was really the execution and style this film took upon itself to create imagery unlike any other seen. Sadly, few people try to take this film's lead, instead, they go for the classic monster/ghost story with some homely looking kid predicting all of the film's events with an aplomb a heart surgeon might have.",7,1,4,31 January 2003
The Purge," The idea was bigger than the movie
","Let's face it, when a mainstream Hollywood film is made, closed minded, money grubbing executives are the ones who ultimately ruin the product. They value money and accessibility over making something that is risky and potentially historic. This sort of mentality is really the only thing that holds back 'The Purge,' and a common echo that will be heard on this film's comment boards is the fact it had so much potential. But even then that mentality could be reminiscent of the story at hand, where Ethan Hawke's character James Sandin makes boat loads of money (literally) but blinds himself to the actual truth of the annual Purge. Too bad the people making the film didn't have a realization to the truth and release their violent tendencies much like James Sandin. But either way, despite all of the punches that are pulled, the film brings up a lot of speculation that makes it more interesting to a sophisticated film goer even though it is advertised as your typical kill fest of the week. While popcorn movie watchers will watch for the violent implications, pretentious snobs like myself will find something much deeper, much more sinister. While the class warfare angle has been overplayed the last couple years, this film managed to turn the idea into actual violence. And while conservatives might just label this as typical anti-wealth liberal Hollywood trash, it is actually quite an allegory for 2nd Amendment enthusiasts and fiscal conservatism. 'Purging' the poor has saved America, unburdening the country of 'parasites' and in turn, has helped create a smaller and more efficient government (presumably) and allowing poor people like James Sandin unprecedented upward mobility through unfettered capitalism. I especially found it interesting when his neighbors turn on Sandin, once again showing classism-based jealousy is not just a poor/wealthy paradigm, but also an affliction that ensnares the upper crust. While all of these things were there for the taking, the direction was what turned 'The Purge' into another run of the mill pseudo horror film. I believe this is where too many people put there opinion into the fray. Imagine the response if the film had some of these scenarios: The people in the masks actually were the neighbors or Sandin was less virtuous, taking advantage of The Purge to make money and not giving a damn about the carnage or implied ethos, or maybe the homeless man they let into the house was truly guilty, an escaped murderer or child molester. The social implications could have gone any way, but even though the filmmakers took the easy way out, the ending still had some interesting implications at the end. I won't say The Purge is great, but at least it wasn't an unmitigated train wreck.",6,12,21,8 June 2013
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Anyone who hates this film has a sad and sorry existence
","Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure was probably one of the most compelling films I've experienced since I first watched it. It has an idea only an indie director could possibly think of, but it avoids all of the campy expositions which would turn it into some bad 'B' film. The story was great, and it was really one of the best depictions of high schools idiots in the history of Hollywood. I mean, you did not see these guys taking tokes or drinking in their spare time, which really vexed some people. They're just stupid for the sake of the story. While the technical aspects weren't special, they worked when they needed it. This film also had one of the best music soundtracks in the history of Hollywood, even if it was from the 1980s. Too many good things to say about this film besides the fact it is a film which doesn't take itself seriously.",8,38,50,20 May 2002
The Matrix," I skipped a class to see this movie, and I still don't regret it
","I remember skipping out on a Spanish class to go see this film, and it was probably one of the first films I learned to enjoy on multiple levels of production (editing, cinematography, sound, etc.). But also, I knew this film would be successful, especially after seeing the original trailer.Even by the time Star Wars came out, I still felt this was the best sci-fi film to come out that year. The cinematography was edgy, and once again established a maxim which all sci-fi films should accept. It mixed in so many different elements: visionary special effects, sound dialogue, a little mystery, a little action, great kung-fu scenes, and plenty of cool production designs. All in all, a strong film, but it revealed too much of the mystery too early, which seemed to be the film's only downside. Carrie-Ann Moss, Laurence Fishburne, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano were all good. But who would have guessed Keanu Reeves could carry a film like this!",9,0,1,28 April 2002
Heat," Michael Mann's opus
","I said this with Luc Besson and Leon, and I'll say again: Michael Mann will always be remembered best for Heat. This film was so different, so ambitious, and it had two of the premiere actors of our times in the same film.I remember doing a class project by making my own movie trailer for this film (which was pretty good, too, for I got an A), and this was the film I instantly thought of. Brilliance is never accepted in the early stages of conception, and I figure it will take years before anyone fully appreciates this film. The cinematography was top notch, the editing was strong, and the acting was excellent. (the music, though primarily ambient, was also solid) While some scenes could have been deleted in the film, it encompassed the idea of the epic, only set in modern times. So many great actors graced this film, its difficult to even name a few of them.",9,0,0,28 April 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Not the best in the series, but better than your average movie
","The original is typically considered the best in regards to a film series, but this isn't necessarily the case with Star Wars. I loved the film as a whole, but stylistically, it doesn't measure up to par. I'll always look at this film in a visionary sense, simply on the level that it simply reshaped film as we know it, which is sometimes more important than the content matter. This seems to be George Lucas' vice: he always makes an average first movie. Episode I was relatively inferior, and Star Wars was fairly pedestrian in many ways. The re-issue was a fantastic film to watch to watch, which makes one wonder: What if Star Wars was released in the 1990s? Always an interesting question to ponder. Nonetheless, I will watch this film every time its on TV or when I have a chance, and I'll certainly be in line when it comes out on DVD.",9,0,2,30 April 2002
Cloud Atlas," A great achievement in filmmaking
","In all the years I've loved and enjoyed movies, one thing that has become consistent with the current trend of filmmaking is the lack of passion. We see tons of movies all the time that simply wish to make money and bore us with their product tie-ins in tow. But Cloud Atlas, thankfully, bucks that trend.It is only fitting that a wonderful group of talented individuals congregated to make this film, beginning with the Wachowskis and Tom Tykwer. Despite their two different viewpoints of filmmaking, combined to make a consistently beautiful piece of film that flows as perfectly as time itself. Never once did this film feel like a three-hour epic, much in the same way one can watch Magnolia and never feel like your time has been intruded upon. While the whole idea of connectivity beckons like any edict from a far eastern religion, it is done so in a way that allows us to see the obvious connections without noticing the lesser ones (staying for the credits certainly helped with that, though I wished they hadn't revealed those connections). Some might think the $100 million price tag is a bit much for a rather dangerous 'art' film, I think the crew managed it quite well considering so many big movies need $150+ just to pay for the sound and visual effects. It comes as no surprise to me that X Filme was the primary production company, for the European filmmaking mindset (which isn't totally concerned with money) was far more suited for this production. I'm sure many will call it a failure due to the many years it will take to recoup the money, but sometimes, art needs to appreciate in order to make its money.Cloud Atlas wasn't perfect, but the problems were purely nominal. I'm talking about the make-up, which was a no win situation from the beginning. You just can't make someone Caucasian look like a real Asian, and vice versa. I don't know, perhaps it would have been better to not change their appearance at all, possibly adding another layer of connectivity that is only obvious to the audience, a bit of dramatic irony so to speak. Either way, I was more than happy with the end product.",9,6,18,27 October 2012
Cube," One of the most original Sci-Fi films in years
","Cube will most likely fall into the annals of obscurity, but itsconcept will most certainly not be forgotten.When I first watched this movie, I didn't know what to expect. At theend, I was impressed. Very few Sci-Fi films try to be smart orpsychological, and this film did it without the heavy special effects,the gratuitous sex appeal and the pedestrian script. Cube will beone of the gems of my DVD collection, and I hope other people feelthe same.",8,0,2,12 April 2002
The Thin Red Line," A Truly Underrated film
","Very few films have touched me in a way this film has. When films are judged more for their fickle content as opposed to their integrity, The Thin Red Line captures all of the great ideals which encompass an incredible film.People have called it an anti-war film, but in the end, it's a more telling example of how a film should be made. All of the characters possess an inner voice, speaking to the heart of all men whether one wants to listen or not. It's a fabulous movie which deserves so much more.",10,0,2,11 April 2002
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The best movie of the series......until further notice
","Until Episode II comes out, this will rank as the best in the series. Not only are we introduced to Yoda, we're introduced to a darker side of the series, a film that doesn't feel like it is a part of the group collective. I think this is why so many fans regard this as the better film. This movie also gave us one of the best sword fights in the history of cinema, culminating in a climax that seemed improbable at first, but quickly made a lot of sense. This was easily Lucas' most witty edition to the series, and it tends to stand up better than most would think.",10,0,1,30 April 2002
Sin City," Robert Rodriguez does it again: his way
","It's become a broken record of late, but Robert Rodriguez is one of the more intriguing film makers in Hollywood. His pizazz and style have simply transcended the rest of the pack and he has made every one of his films an experiment in film making. Just look at Sin City.Even with completely digital backdrops (something he did in Spy Kids 3) he managed to create an environment that seemed real, and only the most nit-picky person could see the inconsistencies. He also strung together a series of great stories and combined them into one experience that never lacks in punch or pacing. And to do it all with a solid list of ensemble actors and A-List All-Stars makes it even more incredible to watch.What was especially interesting was the risks Rodriguez took to make this film. Digital backdrops, dropping out of the Director's Guild, going up against countless fans who questioned the idea of making this film, using a large cast, and staying true to the power and brutality of the comics even when he could have sold out and made it a PG-13 film.Even the actors took risks. Who would have thought Elijah Wood could pull off his role as a sadist, or the two minutes of risqué screen time for Carla Gugino (who caught my attention much in the same vein of Snake Eyes). Alexis Bledel escaping her Gilmore Girls shtick to play a two-faced hooker. Heck, anyone that is still weary of Mickey Rourke could probably put their fears to rest after this movie.There isn't much to say against this film, but I do wish Rodriguez had taken it to the extreme and just leave the movie in black and white. But who knows, when we've had the time to analyze and dissect this film, it won't even be noticed.",9,2,6,4 April 2005
Gangs of New York," One of Scorsese's worst
","People were saying Martin Scorsese should have won an Oscar for this film, but let's face it, this is not one of his better movies. Overwrought with pretentious dialogue and sequences, Gangs was a pretty shallow experience after the opening battle between the Irish and Natives. Martin Scorsese definitely deserves some recognition for his work, but giving him an Oscar for this average film would be like giving Mark Wahlberg an Oscar for Best Actor. Maybe it was because Leonardo DiCaprio was in it, which instantly ruins the credibility of most films, or maybe it was the fact that there were too many reshoots. In the end, Scorsese's dream project could have turned into another Heaven's Gate if it wasn't for his more dedicated fans. Let's hope Scorsese bounces back soon.",6,2,4,11 June 2003
Gladiator," Better After Repeat Viewings
","At first, I thought Gladiator was a fairly undeserving Oscar Winner. But after seeing it a few more times afterward, I began to realize how amazing this film really is. From the very first shot in the wheat to the last shot, Gladiator has a visual power which hasn't been experienced for quite some time. Russell Crowe has also fallen into the type of actor where he is excellent in any role he takes, not matter how bad the film is. I'll be enjoying this film for years to come.",9,1,1,2 May 2002
Donnie Darko," An epic creation
","It's truly rare to see a film with such intrigue and complexity. Donnie Darko was truly a grassroots effort in regards to cult super stardom, but the underlying stories within the movie is certainly one that will keep you guessing and watching with a salivating thirst for more. Jake Gyllenhaal was perfect as the troubled and understated title character, meandering through life while the voice of a demonic rabbit whispering mischievous nothings into his ear. Just about everyone involved with the film brought something different to the table (with the exception of Drew Barrymore, who was pretty static and aloof in the film). But what really made this film so watchable is it didn't try to create pointless plot twists for our boredom-induced amusement. Instead, it grips you from the outset, utilizing the great song 'Killing Moon' by Echo and the Bunnymen to reel you in (though the song is different on the Director's Cut). Watch the film and see for yourself, and simply lose yourself within a truly unique experience.",10,0,2,3 February 2005
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Oh the loathsome treachery of Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay....
","I kept telling myself, that this is a bad franchise and my childhood was raped and corrupted by the evil fascists that are Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay. But like pretty light is to a moth, I felt compelled to watch and once again stumbled into my own fiery death.Dark of the Moon is filled with so much lunacy and idiocy, the numbing effect of this movie has created a generation of stunted, mindless zombies that continue to flock to this detritus and fill the coffers of evil, vile men that were once artists and created movies one could enjoy and not have their intelligence completely insulted. Bay used to make decent action films, and even The Island asked some heady questions between the explosions and chases. Now he is just a parody, and bad one at that. Spielberg should be even more ashamed with himself. He is plopping three horrible films on the public this summer (Super 8, Dark of the Moon, and Cowboys and Aliens) that lack any sense, logic or even a script. We are culpable in turning once talented men into black hearted corporate barons. These people don't even have to try anymore and people throw money into their laps.The movie itself is an insult to film making in general, utilizing a plot that completely disregards the other two movies. But due to the disposable nature of the franchise and each of its chapters, very few people will care or even notice. The idea of a 50-year plan to attack Earth is ambitious in its scope, but all of the plot holes and inconsistencies from the first two movies coupled with bad clichés and stereotypes leaves a more savvy film goer a bit disillusioned. It all comes back to the idea that the movie is about explosions and robots on robot violence. Why don't they just do that instead of waste our time for two and a half hours with nonsense they pass off as plot.The acting was bad, the action was overblown, and the film was littered with stupidity and scientifically incorrect moments (like buildings falling over and Shia LeBeouf surviving a harrowing ship ride that crashed and rolled but he miraculously survived) as well as other moments. I could keep going, but I'm getting a headache trying to wrap my head around this movie.I'm done with this franchise. Plain and simple. Enjoy if you like people...I'm moving on.",2,3,9,4 July 2011
The Wedding Singer," Great satire of the worst decade in US history
","This will always be Adam Sandler's best movie, period. While some of he humor was really dated and sappy, the overall context made this a hilarious look at what pop culture used to be. Sandler and Drew Barrymore have consistently displayed incompetent moments of acting in their careers, they both had a sensibility which seemed real and beside themselves. I especially loved all of the bad 80s references, which added some reality to what a call a biopic of the 1980s (which also proves to be one the most turbulent decades fashion wise). A good film to keep a part of the collection.",7,1,1,2 July 2002
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," A great second fiddle
","Sure, Raiders of the Lost Ark is far better, this film is still pretty darn good in its own respects. Few films that are considered second best in a series could be considered better than most films that are released on its own. But when one watches this film, the action is comparable to Lost Ark. What I especially found interesting was the three obstacles to the Last Crusade, which was amazing, especially the invisible bridge. I've always thought the pairing of Connery and Ford was absolute genius. Someone should have been given a reward for that great casting choice. I can't wait for this one to come out on DVD.",8,3,5,2 April 2003
Back to the Future," A movie that should have stood alone
","This film will always be a classic. Some will call it corny, or even hokie, but it put a new spin on an old sci-fi storyline. And it was even funny! Granted, the whole concept was beaten into the ground with two sequels, the original film in the series demonstrates the timeless nature of this movie. History is always set in stone, but to provide the fantasy of minutely changing your current history is always fun to think about. This was also one of the first movies I actually watched in a theater, so I tend to have some sentimental value placed on this film. But then again, it's well deserved.",8,4,6,29 April 2002
Jurassic Park," A great big step in the realm of CGI
","This film help redefine the nature of special effects, giving the viewer something so realistic, you believe you're a part of the action. Steven Spielberg helped create a legendary film, one CGI artists can claim as the first step in modern CGI technology. Even today, the dinosaurs look good, which illustrates how revolutionary the CGI was. Granted, the script and action seemed forced in some areas, but the again, practically all of the budget was going to the CGI. Sam Neill was good, and Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Samuel L. Jackson and Wayne Knight were great character actors in this film. A neat film to hold onto.",8,1,2,13 May 2002
The Island," The strangeness of a Michael Bay film
","If there is always one thing prevalent in Michael Bay's body of work, he's never consistent. Since Armaggeddon, his films have consistently become more inconsistent with his original work, movies like The Rock and Bad Boys. The big difference with The Island was the fact there were enough things to like about it.The overall design of the film was quite ravishing, especially the scenes in the utopia that all of the clones lived in. And this time around, Bay didn't try too hard to make people think he was something more than an action director. What I also liked about the film were the two leads Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson. It seems laughable that such an unlikely pair would be in a movie together, but they did manage to convey a little innocence and humor in a movie that looked like it would be devoid of such things. But I also thought the film was successful in the area that it didn't really take a side in the whole cloning debate. Society was greedy enough for such luxuries, and who wouldn't be if you had the money?Sadly, the filmed seemed to fail on its biggest promise: the action. The action sequences were daring to say the least, but they were so poorly shot and executed that you couldn't really tell what was going on. Listen, we know stunt doubles were used, so would it kill anyone if the whole 'shaky-hand-held' concept be dumped for better sequences? I was disappointed by the fact Djimon Hounsou and Sean Bean were such poorly written characters, for a lot could have been done with both of them considering the multiple quandaries that existed in their heads.Overall, this is certainly a movie worth watching, especially with the way the film is exposed and color timed (compared to the 'pristine' clarity of digital). I'll certainly buy it on DVD.P.S: It was also another strike against my hometown Tucson. (just watch Revenge of the Nerds, The Wraith, Eight-Legged Freaks, Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, Alice Doesn't Live here Anymore, The Thirteenth Floor, etc.)",7,1,2,1 August 2005
