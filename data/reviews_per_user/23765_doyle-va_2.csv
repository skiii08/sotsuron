Minority Report," Brilliant!
","I think this is one of the best science fiction/action films ever. The pure style and intensity of this film will blow you away at first because it has been so long that a movie this well-made and entertaining has come out. Tom Cruise is excellent, and so is Colin Farrell in a smaller role. It's a shame we couldn't have seen more of Colin's character in the film-for he was entertaining to watch. There are sly bits of comedy that'll make you smile-and the fight scene in the car factory is phenomenal. I'm sorry if my word choice seems hyperbole-like, but after watching this film-you can't help but feel pumped. This movie is damn near close to being a 10, but I thought that they threw a little too many endings at you-which left you jarred. However, each ending wasn't shoddy or just thrown in there to make the plot make more sense.This film proves that Spielburg is the master of making an entertaining film-and is a must see!",9,0,0,11 June 2005
The Village," A good movie marred by a bad twist
","I really wanted to like The Village. The trailers made it look scary and the plot look very interesting. I truly could not wait to see what twist M. Night Shyamalan could come up with involving the creatures.But after seeing the movie I was left severely disappointed. I felt ripped off-for M. Night Shyamalan took the easy way in ending the movie. He didn't ponder up an idea that truly was good, instead, he tacked on an ending that I'm sure many had already thought of before the movie even started.BUT---I did like the overall style of the movie. I liked the design of the creatures and something does happen about halfway through the movie that is unexpected. It's not really a twist, but I don't think you'll see it coming.Bryce Dallas Howard was very well as the blind girl Ivy.The dialogue was very extraneous and wordy and boring.Perhaps my expectations were too high. The idea and execution of the idea for the first 3/4 of the film was excellent, but due to it's shoddy 'twist' and boring dialogue, this film doesn't deliver to its fullest extent",5,0,0,11 June 2005
