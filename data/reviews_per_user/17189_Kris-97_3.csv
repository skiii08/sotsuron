Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," (almost) bomb
","X generation-like animation with no particular reason. Thin story. Good renderings but so what? I was disappointed to see the Jedi 'philosophy' almost missing, something which made the other episodes sane. I mean, should I like someone because he's dressed in white (beige) and hate everyone with red marks on a black face?. As for the digital architecture (who dunnit?): a student wouldn't get a very good mark in it. I really expected much more, Mr Lucas!",3,0,1,4 October 1999
The Mummy," B film with a C story and a D cast
","Infantile story dressed up with big budget and little imagination or direction skill. If this is the level of the B movies today, it's then very low. Both thumbs down, including my toes. I hear there's a sequel on the way. Beware that, cross on the oher side of the street.",Null,0,0,8 March 2000
American Beauty," Mmm, err...
","So, let's count the clich√©s in this story: 1) Mother takes over family just because the other two are frustrated enough thus, gave up their own life 2) All smiling, nobody means it. All working, nobody enjoys it. 3) Girl with boobs as big as a child's head secretly saves money for a silicone enlargement. 4) School mate of the above afraid of being ordinary, plays cool. 5) Pupils (and others) smoking weed. 6) All having guns or thinking of some sort of crime. 7) Liberated gays. 8) Father falls for `Lolitta'. 9) Mother has affair with business man. Did they really enjoy it or was it again a performance? 10)  Oh yea, mother had enough of father so he has to jerk of in the shower 11) Son of closeted gay develops interior life with tiny obsessions 12) Closeted gay joins the army and secretly admires the nazi discipline which imposes to his family, making everyone miserable. In a moment of emotional weakness he `confesses' his love for men. Oops, to the wrong person, whom he decides to kill, in order to bury his secret again. Why is there so little concern with beauty these days, in what we do, in what we want to tell to each other?",Null,0,0,19 March 2000
