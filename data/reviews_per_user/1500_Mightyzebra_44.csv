The Sound of Music," My very favourite film - the songs are lovely and so are the characters! :) :)
","This famous film is about a failing nun who has to become a governess. Why? Because one of the nuns thinks it will help her do something important rather than failing to be a nun. Anyway, Maria (the failing nun) goes to a very wealthy captain to look after his seven children. Maria finds that they have been bossed around by their father since their mother's death. Can Maria find a way to let them play and be free? Why do I love this film so much? Read the following reasons.Reason 1: I love all the children. They are misbehaving, though underneath they have their own lovely characters. Gretl is my favourite! Reason 2: The Austrian scenery is spectacular, especially the first two to five minutes at the beginning. The scenery on the hill and just before Do Re Mi is good as well! Reason 3: Julie Andrews is SO good as Maria, better than as Mary Poppins in my opinion anyway. Christopher Plummer is good too, although I can't really compare him because this is the only film I've seen him in. The actors and actresses who did the children were really good as well. Reason 4: The songs! The songs! SOME PEOPLE ON IMDb GIVE BAD COMMENTS ON THE SONGS! I adore them, come on other people, please give them more credit. 'Do Re Mi', 'How do you solve a problem like Maria', 'The Sound Of Music', 'Edelweiss (I think that's how you spell it)', love them all please! Reason 5: The plot is lovely throughout the film until it comes to the end. There are many more reasons than these which I can't remember. So, what are you waiting for? Those who haven't, PLEASE WATCH THIS DARLING MOTION PICTURE! Advertised by ME. :) ;) :()",10,1,7,18 February 2007
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," I personally prefer the book by Dodie Smith!!
","Genre: Cartoon, dogs, adventure, based on Dodie Smith's book.What happens: So the film is about two Dalmatians meeting with each other. Their owners and the dogs fall in love with each other and the dogs give birth to 15 puppies! However, someone called Cruella DeVil has her eye on the pupsMy thoughts: This is a good film, but why did the Disney company have to make this? They could have just left the idea alone and based their next film on their imagination. However, no, they decided to make a film based on Dodie Smith's lovely book.I prefer the book to the film, as I have told you before. The film is good, but it would be much better if it had the following things added or changed: One: In the book, the mother of the pups was called Missis and Perdita was a liver Dalmatian Anita found on the road. I would like the film to have this. Two: The film has less of Pongo and Perdita and more of the pups. In the book, more than half of the story concentrates on the grown-ups. This change in the film annoys me a little. Three: In the book, Lucky is not a sickly puppy. Instead of Lucky being the sickly one, there's a sickly puppy called Cadpig and he isn't in the film!! Why couldn't the Disney company have included Cadpig!?I prefer the book, folks! I rate it 10 out of 10!",6,1,4,2 August 2007
Kung Fu Panda," A fun film - good for adults and kids!
","This is the new animated film from Dreamworks and I am pleased to say that it is very good! It is so good, in fact, that some (myself included) could consider it better than any of the Shrek films! :-) The main character of this film is a podgy panda called Po, who finds himself, randomly picked, to become the blessed Dragon Warrior of China and fight the evil and very powerful snow leopard Tai Lung. However, Po has a number of problems: He has never practised Kung Fu, he does not at all have the skill and energy and he is way more interested in food. However, the leader of China, an ancient tortoise, believes that this chubby panda can become the dragon warrior. This is going to take a great amount of work, both for Po and for his trainer, Shifu...I like this film because of the stunning CGI, the plot, the characters and the moral of the story: You can be who you want to be if you just believe. 'Kung Fu Panda' has its frightening and violent fighting scenes, its touching scenes and its funny scenes.I recommend this to anyone who likes fun films and who like pandas - for both adults and children! Enjoy 'Kung Fu Panda'! :-)",8,0,1,22 July 2008
The Hunger Games," Mixed feelings about this sick film.
","Firstly, I watched this film without having read the book and only having a vague idea of the plot. So I was not expecting the film to be quite as sick and twisted as it was. The fact that so many kids have to die in the film is sad and wrong. I cried when I saw one (really REALLY nice) character die. Also, the beginning, when all the kids aged 12-18 are forced to come up to risk their lives in the Hunger Games (although only two from each Province are randomly picked), made me feel very angry with the government and upper class people in the film, who are in charge of the cruel operation of the Hunger Games.I saw it with a group of friends, including my sibling. My sibling told his best friend, who was with us, the basic plot of the film before we watched it. After we had all watched 'The Hunger Games', my sibling's best friend told said that he had thought his plot synopsis was a joke. He had thought the basic plot, (kids being picked to kill each other) was a joke! This goes to show that even tough kids will be shocked by the premise of this film.So, yes, the film has its moments. Call me cheesy, but I did enjoy the romance scenes, probably because they were some of the few scenes in the film where people show any degree of humanity or feeling. I also thought the acting, the character development, the designs and the costumes were brilliant. But most of the film just turned my stomach as they were so inhumane, barbaric and irritating, because of this.",5,7,11,7 April 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," All right.
","Unfortunately, this is not nearly as good as the first 'Pirates of the Caribbean' film, for me anyway. It is a great deal more tedious, has more fighting (which is quite boring) and less plot and story. If you liked the fighting in the last film, you will enjoy this sequel more than I did, as this has a great deal more of the fighting than the last film does.Jack Sparrow (Oh wait - sorry!) Captain Jack Sparrow is craving for one thing. It is a chest, with Davy Jones' heart. Davy Jones is the pirate captain of a ghost ship, his whole crew are dead. Meanwhile, both Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan have been arrested and Will Turner escapes and to free Elizabeth Swan he needs to give Captain Jack Sparrow's compass to someone else. With help of her father, Elizabeth Swan manages to escape anyway and steals on a ship disguised as a man. An exciting adventure is about to enroll...For people who like pirates, exciting films with quite a lot of fights, gory bits and pretty good humour, this film is for you. 6 and a half out of ten.",6,0,2,22 December 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A very good film.
","This is a fun, swashbuckling, exciting, well-acted, well-plotted, obsessive and dramatic film, good for grown-ups and teens. Before you start watching this, remember that this is not for the faint-hearted.Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) are the stars of this pirate film, all with very different personalities and good acting. Captain Jack Sparrow, in this film, has been a pirate for some time - and is very good at it. He leads the film on with his daring deeds, plunders and sword-play. Will Turner's character has the most surprises. He is thought to be a humble blacksmith, but instead he turns out to be a good swordsman and later, a good pirate. Elizabeth Swan is the governor's daughter, but soon it turns out that she is captured by pirates. She is very firm, brave and is not the kind of person to give up. Though she has grown up good and posh, it seems she has a bit of pirate in her too...I'll save most of the plot as a surprise for you, but be prepared for a little bit of gore (but not a great amount) and some rather scary skeletons (depending on how you see them).I like this film because of the actors, the adventures, the lines from the characters, the plot and the way this was made. There are some very good graphics here which work incredibly well (sometimes a little too well).I recommend this film to people who are not too scared by action and just that little bit of horror and who like funny bits in action films as well. Enjoy 'Pirates of the Caribbean'! :-)",8,0,5,7 August 2008
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Rather overdone, but very good all the same.
","I very much enjoy this adaption of the famous book by C.S Lewis, but there were certain things changed from the book in this film that did not need to be changed:1. The landscape and everything was overdone, and it looked fake.2. The end battle was overdone.3. At least one of the children looked different to how they looked before (for example, in the book, Lucy had black hair, not brown).However, some of the things that happened in the film worked very well. All the main actors and actresses were good, the CGI worked well and was very effective, the people who voiced the CGI characters did well and the way the story was shortened worked as it should have done, although some of the film seemed a bit rushed at points, but the whole film would have seemed even longer if they had lengthened scenes.You probably know the story, four children are evacuated to the country in the time of WWII, they find a wardrobe that leads to another world, they meet a lion called Aslan and they meet an evil witch. This summary says it all.I recommend this film to people who appreciate what modern technology can do nowadays, people who have read the book and people who like fantasy films. Enjoy! :-)",8,0,0,17 September 2008
Madagascar," A very fun film - with a surprising amount of good qualities.
","Personally I think this is better than any of the Shrek films (although possibly NOT Shrek 1). It has very good voices for the characters (including Ben Stiller, David Schwimmer, Chris Rock and Jada Pinkett Smith), it has very amusing jokes and a well-structured and interesting story-line. The settings, New York City, Madagasgar and the middle of the ocean also do well in the story. I think the thing I liked most about this film was the portrayal of New York City, it gave a very good atmosphere and impression on the city and (having been there) looks very much like NYC. The flaws I felt were the rudeness of some of the jokes - I would not recommend any children between three and six to watch this as they may take on some of the rude jokes. Also, the songs they picked for background were good - but why did they not include some new songs!? This drives me crazy, in my memory I have not seen a single CGI feature film with its own written songs.Anyway, a film well-worth watching. It is about four animals in Central New York zoo (a lion, a zebra, a giraffe and a hippo) who find themselves escaping and off to the wild. It includes quite a few plot turns, a great deal of them amusing, but they are all exciting.I recommend this to all adults who love CGI films with good humour and to children who like watching anything funny. Enjoy! :)",8,1,1,6 June 2008
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Not as good as the original
","Some sequels are a lot more disappointing, or unoriginal, compared to the first film, or possibly even the book. This is not quite as clever or entertaining as the original film, but it is certainly better than a few other sequels, animated or non-animated. This film has much more slapstick, more swearing and a few more dirty jokes. Yet, this film also has good points, such as funny, entertaining enough new characters and quite a good plot. Scrat also appears more in this one, possibly good news for those who adore him.So all in all, entertaining, but the original is better quality.The film starts with Scrat, the little guy who can make a huge mess and trying to find his acorn, he climbs up a steep ice slope and then starts to make a 'leak' in the ice slope! You then see our friends Sid, Manny and Diego...6 and a half out of ten.",6,0,0,29 September 2007
Finding Nemo," A unique film.
","This is arguably the most beautiful and most captivating of all the Pixar films to date. It is good for most children because they will like the characters, find it funny and exciting and learn valuable lessons. Adults may like it because of the beauty of the CGI, the characters and the feeling of charm and a different kind of friendship and love in this film. Adults and children may feel sad with love for the film and the characters when catastrophes happen, they may feel happy when there are funny scenes and when something good happens to the characters. This is one truly magical, beautiful and entertaining film, possessing few flaws and just about every quality an animated film should possess.The storyline of the film is exciting and captivating - also funny. It starts sadly, when a mate of a clownfish dies, Coral, the mate of Marlin. All of their eggs are also eaten - save one egg. Marlin calls the little fish inside (the name that Coral wanted to give one of their babies) Nemo. A few fish years later, Nemo is ready to go to school, but Marlin is an incredibly protective father and is not so sure. Despite his worries, he lets the eager Nemo go to school, but is still cautious. It turns out he has a right to be - when Nemo is captured by divers! Marlin does the unthinkable, he goes out into the open ocean to find his son - encountering dangers and a new friend (Dory) on the way...Good for just about everyone. I hope you enjoy 'Finding Nemo', whoever you are!",9,0,1,2 March 2008
Juno," A sweet film - not just for teenagers.
","This is a sweet film for anyone over the age of 10. Yes, it does have quite a lot of sex in it. The story is sweet, the plot is sweet and the love is sweet (if you are thinking what I am thinking, then this film is like biting into a milkyway bar). All these parts of the film are good as well as sweet. The characters, are well planned and thought up and the setting, Minnesota in all the four seasons, are good as well. In this film, a girl called Juno, aged 16, finds herself pregnant. This would not be so abnormal in the middle ages, but 'Juno' is a contemporary film and this pregnancy is pretty serious. Juno has a great deal to think about, for example, telling her parents, telling the future father (a cute boy called Bleeker) and finding someone instead of her to take care of the baby...I recommend this film to anyone who likes sweet films with teenagers and who do not mind a bit of sex and a bit of language, who is over 10 (people over 60 may or may not like this, but if you are over 60, you ought to look at some other reviews before you make your final decision). Enjoy 'Juno'! :-)P.S It seems to me that this film is supposed to discourage under-age pregnancy, because of the trouble Juno has to go through.",8,1,3,22 June 2008
The Jungle Book," I can imagine making a film out of Rudyard Kipling's treasure is very hard work...
","Genre: Cartoon, based on Rudyard Kipling's book, jungle.Main characters: Mowgli (Bruce Reitherman), Bagheera (Sebastian Cabot), Baloo (Phil Harris) and Shere Khan (George Sanders).What happens: A panther called Bagheera finds a little 'mancub' in a basket in a broken boat. Bagheera knows that the baby would perish without any care. He then decides to take the boy to the wolf pack...My thoughts: For the young, this will be a pleasurable film. They will instantly fall in love with the characters and be excited for them all, watching this film over and over again, maybe enjoying it a little more each time. Then, as they grow older, they may prefer other films and find some parts of this a little 'eerie' as I did (of course, some may not pay attention to the weirdly spooky music which appears at times). They may get scared of Shere Khan. Then, they may read the book and realise what a floppy mess of the book this is. They may not like it for a long while afterwards, constantly reading the beautiful book instead. Then, at golden teenager hood, they may slightly go back into this film again, watching it more often than usual, reading the book as well. For the rest, I do not know. All this happened to me and I wouldn't be surprised if it happened to at least one person in the world (for one thing, SOO many people have watched this).This film is better for you to watch if you're in a VERY good mood. Otherwise, it kind of gives a flop. Luckily for me, I do not find it as spooky as I did for a few years and I like parts. I see Colonel Haiti as a tribute to Rudyard Kipling, as he enjoyed writing books about the army. Mowgli in this is basically a spoilt little young boy, not noble unlike in the books. Baloo will be likely not to impress those who have read the books as he is a bit silly. Although him teaching Mowgli happens in the book and he is a goodie through and through (although in the book Baloo teaches Mowgli the laws of the jungle). Bagheera, as the film starts, is very likable but then his performance fails into about twenty minutes of the film as he starts to become fed up with Mowgli. The wolves are good, although they have a much bigger part in Rudyard Kipling's work and the mother wolf in the book is fiercer than her mate, unlike in this film. Kaa has the character of Tabaqui the jackal's and he is not a nice character (although Sterling Holloway does a good job, I have to admit). Shere Khan is much more evil than in the book and he is more of a 'main character'. King Louie is pointless really, I do not see why Wolfgang Reitherman had to put in a dancing Orangutang that wanted to make fire. I am very grateful for the Beatles vultures, they CERTAINLY do not appear in the books and they are good in this. The title of this film is not very good to the book, it would be better being called something like 'Adventure of Mowgli' or 'Story of Mowgli'. In 'The Jungle Book' many more characters appear beside our ones here.Recommended to: People who HAVE NOT read the book (after you've watched the film please read it!), very young children and maybe grown-ups. 6 and a half out of ten.",6,2,6,6 September 2007
Spider-Man 3," Exhilarting, enjoy the ride.
","Easy enough to understand if you have not watched the first films, this film is incredibly dangerous, exciting and gripping. Not overly scary, this film is not exactly for the faint- hearted, especially for the faint-hearted with lots of feelings for the character. Peter Parker is very much in love with Mary Jane, who is unfortunately not doing incredibly well with her musical career. Meanwhile, Peter is starting to have problems with Harry - and with the mysterious and mean sandman...This film is specifically recommended to Spiderman fans, people who like actions films without too much horror and people who like to get quite a thrill in films. Enjoy! :-)7 and half out of ten.",7,1,2,9 December 2007
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," A beautiful film
","This was both my first proper Western and my first proper Paul Newman film - and I was extremely pleased with it. It combines gun shooting with romance, wit, an adventure and two characters that you can never forget: Butch Cassidy (played by Paul Newman - R.I.P) and the Sundance Kid (played by Robert Redford). You stay with these two characters and their female partner (played by Katharine Ross), the whole way and you begin to love 'em. In this film, two Western outlaws called Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, find themselves the only surviving members of their criminal gang: the Hole in the Wall gang. The two try to start building new lives, but they can still not keep away from bank robbing...I loved this film because of everything in it - the only things I did not like about this film are the endless amount of gun fightings (many of these scenes could have easily been shortened). What I enjoyed most about this film was the romance and adventure, often you feel like you are really there with BC and TSK when they gallop, canter, trot and walk their horses through the wilds of America. The wit was also a very good touch, just about necessary in my opinion - although many other people will disagree with me on this.I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys gun shooting, good actors, romance, humour and amazing journeys combined! Enjoy 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'! :-)",9,0,2,31 October 2008
The Polar Express," I really love this film!
","With colourful and lovable characters, a fast-paced storyline and beautifully done computer animation, I love 'The Polar Express' very much indeed! You warm to the characters easily, which I like. The computer animation sometimes makes you feel like you're REALLY THERE. I'm sure the IMAX version makes it look even more beautiful! :) I recommend it to people who believe in Christmas, like exciting films and beautiful CGI! Enjoy! :) Note: I DO NOT recommend it to grumpy people. I don't think grumpy people would enjoy a film like this.A boy (who does not believe in Father Christmas) wakes up on Christmas Eve, to the sound of an approaching train. It is bound for the North Pole...",8,2,3,23 May 2007
"Monsters, Inc."," Not my favourite Pixar...
","There are things I do like about this film. I find some moments incredibly beautiful (such as one bit at the end), I like the selection of actors for voicing the characters (especially Randall), I like the CGI used and there are quite a few very good jokes. However, I just feel this is 'weaker' than a few other Pixar films, such as Toy Story 2, Ratatouille, Cars and of course, Finding Nemo. I also find this a little bit too fast paced, for most of the film there is constant tension. Despite this, I do think that this film is well worth watching at least once and entertaining enough.The plot is pretty easy to follow. The whole film is about monsters who scare human children at night, coming from the closet. As the film goes on and the plot unravels, we meet Sulley and Mike, two monsters who help each other in this scaring business. We then find out the monsters do it because they it helps power their world (like electricity and batteries do to ours). Soon a large adventure follows involving Boo...I recommend this to children who do not mind constant tension and worry in animated films and for people who like other Pixar films. Enjoy! :-)",7,0,1,31 March 2008
Grease," Grease has remained the word for nearly 30 years!
","Nirmal Kirtisinghe, I agree with you this is one TOP happy musical! I didn't like it as much as you did Nirmal, but I enjoyed it like you for the songs, happiness and for the fact that there are no unnecessary twists. Everyone should see it, even if they don't enjoy it afterwards. It's also a good introduction for the teenager world! Two teenagers called Sandy and Danny spend their summer together and are sad when they have to leave each other. However, when they realise they are at the same high school, things take a turn for the best - or for the WORST..?I recommend this for people who like good musicals, teenage life, being cool and (like you Nirmal said) happiness! :) :)",8,1,3,5 April 2007
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," A surprisingly good sequel
","This is the best animated sequel I've seen in ages... Wait, let me re-phrase that. This is not quite the best animated sequel I've seen in ages, but it is so good that it almost is better than the original film for me and usually I prefer the first films to the seconds films. The only reason I prefer the original film to this is because there are no New York City scenes here. In 'Madagasgar', the New York City scenes were very much a highlight, very realistic to the actual places. In many places I find this sequel funnier than the original, there are some very good one-liners here and a few slapstick jokes which are marginally good as well. In this sequel the personalities of all the main characters in the last film are properly revealed and makes them more likable as characters. They were all very good and entertaining and likable in the first film, but here you get to see their 'inner' feelings and all that jazz. This film starts with a father lion in the middle of the African savannah teaching his very young and very cute cub the ways of being a leader and he hopes that one day this little cub will take over the pride. However, the cub is all play and dance, something which slightly disappoints the father lion. Just then, an enemy lion comes to challenge the adult lion and they battle - leaving the cub unsupervised... He is captured by humans and eventually arrives in New York City zoo. Yes, the cub is Alex!To see and enjoy this film you must really watch 'Madagasgar', the first film. If you watch this first, then you are probably going to be incredibly confused and it is not worth seeing this. I recommend this great film to everyone who enjoyed the first film, to everyone who loves Africa in computer animation and to people who enjoyed the humour of the last film. Enjoy 'Madagasgar 2'! :-)",8,1,3,17 January 2009
Duck Soup," My first Marx Brothers film...
","... and I was not disappointed! After hearing quite a deal about the Marx Brothers, watching this film was very satisfying. This old film has a blend of farce (not very much though), slapstick and witty humour, resulting in one of the best types of humour ever! Not only is the humour a good feature of this film, but it was made well (especially for the time), it was acted very well (especially by Groucho Marx) and the plot was done well. This is what I enjoyed about the film. The only problem I found with this film was that it was slightly too short - they could have easily fitted in one or two more good jokes. Ah well, I am grateful for what the makers DID produce! :-)In this film, there are two countries near to each other, Freedonia and Sylvania. Freedonia has a new leader, Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx) and he makes things complicated for both Freedonia and Sylvania, with his rather odd manner (you will understand when you watch this film). Hilarious political capers commence...I recommend this film to people who like funny films of any type, people who like crazy films, people who like humour with a mixture of (primarily) slapstick and wittiness and people who like watching films for historical interest. The recommended age is 9 and up. Enjoy 'Duck Soup'! :-)P.S The title has nothing to do with the film except for ducks in a boiling pot in the beginning credits.P.P.S I am not a fan of slapstick - but I love quite a deal of the slapstick here! :-)",9,1,2,21 September 2008
Ratatouille," A very sweet film with very cute rats!
","If you have ever said that rats are cute but no-one believes you, this animated CGI film may just be able to prove your point! With a weird, topsy-turvy plot with good Pixar quality, this film is sure to delight! Even though the adventure and dare may overdo itself, the characters and theme thankfully do not. The theme is cooking and it will not be a surprise that you will want to eat/cook just after you have viewed this motion picture! Also like all Pixar films, this has good quality CGI, the water and Paris sequences are definitely something to admire. So even if you are becoming bored of CGI, this film WILL NOT make you even more bored! Remy is a rat in France with an unusual dream: to cook. He is originally starting out life testing food for rat poisoning, but of course he is becoming bored. When a crazy old woman chases him and his rat family (which is a huge number of rats) out of her home, Remy loses his way and ends up lost in the sewers. There, he resolves to follow his dream and finding the famous 'Gustseau's Restaurant' and is determined to start cooking. Remy also meets the amateur chef Linguini...The only downside to this film is that the plot is a little anxious and hectic. Luckily, like medicine, the cute rats and goodies make it better! :-) Enjoy 'Ratatouille'! :-)",8,2,3,19 January 2008
Enchanted," Very enchanted.
","There are few films which can make you squirm and wriggle with delight as you watch them. This is one of them.It has many good film qualities. Both cartoon AND CGI animation, wonderful filming, the portrayal of a fairytale as ridiculous, the idea of the film is simply brilliant, the characters inspiring, the songs good, many laughs - and the list is just about endless! This film is simply enchanted (as you may have worked out from the title).Starting as a cartoon fairy story, a prince, the son of an evil queen who does not want anyone to take over her throne, rides into the forest to hunt for trolls and hears a beautiful voice in the forest. He finds a young girl and immediately decides to marry her the next day. Before they marry, an old crone takes the girl (who is Giselle) to a well and tells Giselle to wish for whatever she wants. The well is very large and deep and while she is on the very edge, the old crone pushes her and she falls down, down, until she finds herself in New York!Good for fairy-tale lovers of any age and for people who also like to have laughs in Disney princess films, this is the film for you.Enjoy 'Enchanted'! :-)",9,1,2,22 December 2007
Mamma Mia!," Very fun and light!
","You did not like this? Obviously you did not realize this is meant to be a fun, light, ridiculous, funny musical, not some dark romance and mystery tale. It could not possibly be more fun, light, ridiculous, funny and musical - and that is why this film is so good! I loved it for this reason, as well as the actors and actresses picked, all of the singers were good, even Pierce Brosnan (I have no idea why everyone thinks his voice is so terrible - you should hear my dad!). Anyhow, in this film, a girl named Sophie, living on a Grecian island, is going to be married in one day and has invited three men that COULD be her father to the wedding. When they arrive, without Sophie's mother realizing, pandemonium ensues - but fun pandemonium..!I also had the opportunity to watch this in a 'Sing-Along' Screening, which made the experience much more fun, especially in the cinema. I recommend this for karaoke sleepover nights!This film is best for happy people, people who like ridiculous fun, ridiculously funny films and musicals. Enjoy 'Mamma Mia'! :-)",9,1,3,28 August 2008
Cars," A wild ride with Lightning McQueen!
","I LOVE this film. It is fun, exciting and it's about cars in a new perspective! I LOVE this film. I don't need to tell you again - do I? Lightning McQueen is a young racing car who has almost won his first race! Unfortunately, he didn't quite make it. He is determined to win a big race for the Piston cup! However, Mac, his carrier falls asleep on the way to the racing track and Lightning McQueen falls out, getting lost! :( He ends up in a small town called Radiator Springs in the middle of the desert ...Here are the five main reasons I LOVE this film. One: I love the Pixar perfect animation, especially the desert scenes. Two: All the characters are likable, except for Chick, who I think sucks (he's the main baddie but luckily doesn't appear much). Three: The plot in this is well-thought up, unlike many cartoon films these days. Four: I like how Lightning McQueen learns his lesson near the end of the film. This improves his character - then he isn't just a racing car who wants to win. Five: The voices suit the characters. I like Lightning McQueen's (Owen Wilson), Mater's (Larry the cable guy) and Sally's (Bonnie Hunt) voices best. So, if you haven't watched this, then DO! :) ;) :()",8,0,0,4 March 2007
Stardust," Only just 8/10 from mightyzebra
","In just about no doubts, this is an entertaining, exciting adventure and fantasy film. But just how many good points are there to it?1. Even without animation this is good for children (except for a few pieces of CGI to help with the special effects). 2. Some parts are 'Tongue in cheek' to entertain adults. 3. There is good acting in this film. 4. The storyline is very well-thought up and convincing. 5. There are many charming and a few heart-wrenching parts of this film.In what seems to be the Victorian era, a young man walks over a long wall beside his home town and enters an amazing, remarkable whole new world. He meets a slave girl, who calls herself a princess. Nine months later, back in his home town, he receives a baby in a basket and he realises it is from the slave girl over the wall...Years later, the baby Tristain is nearly a grown man and he is in love with a woman whom he lives near to. They see a shooting star fall from the sky and it lands over the wall and Tristain tells her he will go over the wall to give her the star...Recommended for children aged 10 and above (because of a few rather tense fighting scenes), this is an entertaining film good for the whole family.

Amadeus," A true masterpiece.
","Two composers, unalike in talent, In Salzburg and Vienna.In this motion picture, moving and beautiful, Heart-capturing and never-forgotten, Sometimes funny, sometimes emotional, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri Take a stand to compose music.Mozart composes such incredibly beautiful music, While Salieri's does little to shine out.Salieri, full of jealousy for Mozart, Starts to earn revenge in a cruel way.Which, if steady eyes wait, You will see how Salieri earns his bitter revenge.",9,1,2,18 June 2008
Shrek the Third," A very good sequel
","As far as sequels go, this is very good. As far as Shrek films go, this is also very good. Like all the others, this one is entertaining, funny and exciting. Despite the plot being slightly unoriginal, this film's plot is very well-planned and fast-paced.Compared to the second one, the old characters in this 'Shrek' film are exceedingly good. Shrek is often a lovely happy old ogre and a lot nicer and more gentle than in any of the other films. Donkey is still an amusing donkey - luckily not too annoying! Princess Fiona (always an ogre) in this film has a strong, quite eager and often relaxed personality, which very much suits her. Unfortunately, Puss in Boots doesn't have the chance to do nearly as well as he did the second film, but still has the same good personality (possibly a little more Spanish!).The new characters are very well done. The wizard (voiced by Eric Idle) is an incredibly amusing character with a funnily worried personality. Artie is a nice guy, although when provoked can produce quite a temper. Overall he is a good character.While King Harold (now a frog) is ill, Shrek is taking responsiblities of running the kingdom and feels he is DEFINITELY not cut out to be a king. Just before the poor frog comes to his place in heaven, he tells Shrek that besides him, the only heir is a wee boy called Arthur. Is he cut out to be king..?Enjoy 'Shrek the Third'! :-)7 and a half out of ten.",7,3,4,2 December 2007
The Nightmare Before Christmas," One enjoyable Halloween film!
","Capturing the eye and and the attention of the watcher, this film has a magical, somewhat scary quality. It has beautiful puppet animation with skeletons, ghouls and even pleasant things such as Father Christmas. The songs are very imaginative - bouncy yet flowing and not necessarily rhyming. The characters are also very engaging and lively - especially Jack Skellington himself and Oogie Boogie. The plot keeps twisting and turning in a good way as a plot should - and many things don't happen that happen in many children's films, past and present. One flaw of this film is that it is a little scary and this may put off young children. This film also feels surprisingly short - despite being a full-length feature film. Otherwise, a perfect Halloween and Christmas film! :-)The main character is Jack Skellington, a skeleton, who is extremely good at scaring people at Halloween. He lives in Halloween Town, with vampires, werewolves and other scary creatures and people. Jack wishes for some other life where he does not have to hear screams and scare people and that is when he discovers the wonderous Christmas Town...A good treat for every person who likes animated films -especially those who are aged 7 and up. Enjoy 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'!",8,2,2,3 November 2007
Shrek 2," Not the best of the lot
","As are all of the Shrek films, this is very entertaining, hilarious and exciting. However, it has more unhappiness than any of the others and more unfairness, which may bring it down for some people. The characters' personalities are very noticeable...Shrek's personality: In this film, Shrek is rather unhappy, moved or sentimental. He is unhappy because (for some absurd reason) he thinks Fiona doesn't love him because he is an ogre, he is moved by the stunningly adoring face of Puss in boots and he is sentimental because of Fiona and him loving each other. Overall, he is not as good as he is in the first film - or even the third. He doesn't even supply many jokes in this one.Donkey's personality: As funny as ever, Donkey is also a little grumpy in this one, but makes much more of an amusing, uplifting performance than his comrade Shrek. ***SLIGHT SPOILER AHEAD, SLIGHT Spoiler AHEAD!!** He is also very entertaining as a white stallion, his looks are certainly handsome!Princess Fiona's personality: A bit like Shrek, Fiona's personality is too slightly disappointing, luckily supplying a few jokes (she supplied just about none in the first film - but a few in the third) She usually feels unhappy, confused and angry. You hardly see a smile on her. Dragon's personality: Disappointingly the dragon just about doesn't appear in the film at all, except for a bit at the very end. This is one downfall to this film.NEW CHARACTERSHarold: You can tell immediately that Harold has a rather high temper and is rather nervous. Overall though he is a good character, as he loves Fiona and his wife Lilian dearly. ***QUITE MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD!!** He also develops a friendship with Shrek. Harold is probably the one to turn the film's plot around to a very worrying, thrilling point. Quite a good character.Lilian: Lilian's personality is not completely clear, but though she's very nice and becomes worried quite easily, she's not the perfect queen who is good as gold. She doesn't mind speaking out her worries (in the third film she shows this much more). A good character. Puss in boots: Soon to be Shrek and Donkey's new companion, Puss appears sinister at first, but is really quite a nice ball of fur, although can fight with a sword and could probably kill Shrek if he tried. Fairy Godmother: Probably the main baddie, the Fairy Godmother is not such a sweet kind godmother when she puts her mind to it. She can also become rather aggressive.Prince Charming: Not all that charming after all, this rather cowardly prince who keeps moaning to his mother (the Fairy Godmother) is determined to kill Shrek, using whatever means necessary.What happens is that Shrek and Fiona are going to celebrate their marriage at a ball prepared by Fiona's parents in Far Far Away. Unfortunately, Fiona's father is not at all happy that her daughter has married and IS an ogre. Things are taking a turn for the surprising... All in all, this is a good film, but for a 'Shrek' sequel, it could be slightly better. Enjoy 'Shrek 2'!",7,0,1,1 December 2007
Singin' in the Rain," A lovely, great film, worth watching by just about anybody.
","This was not my first film starring Gene Kelly, but it had a good light to it and I very much enjoyed it. :-) It has fantastic dancing from Gene Kelly and Donald O' Connor, an expected but lovely storyline, wonderful characters, good themes to the plot (such as the one of the main characters starting out as stunt men and struggling through the beginning of 'talkie' films), memorable and likable songs and a shiny MGM quality no longer made in films. If there is one thing I am slightly negative about 'Singin' in the Rain', it is that the horrible woman is so horrible and has a very irritating voice.In this film, we meet the film star Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and his (sort of) fiancée Lina Lamont. Trying to escape hordes of fans aware of his fame and desperate for an autograph, he finds himself in a woman stranger's (Debbie Reynolds) car. She is quite impertinent about the way he is behaving, partly because she does not watch films and does not realize Don Lockwood is famous. He tries to explain to her he is an 'actor' and basically she replies, 'I'm an actress, but I act on the stage.' She tries as quickly as possible to deposit Don out of her car, who has already decided he is in love with her and not Lina. We meet his friend Cosmo Brown, who is very close to Don and for the characters mentioned above, there is later plenty to be dancing and singing about..!Highly recommended to whole families of people who like musicals, absolutely fantastic dancing, quite funny films and romance films. A real classic, enjoy 'Singin' in the Rain'! :-)",9,0,1,9 September 2009
Toy Story 2," A fun sequel
","I have not seen the first Toy Story for ages, but what I remember is a film with hardly any emotion, just exciting things happening and a boy who rips toys apart and schtuff. However, I see this quite often and I very much like it! It is a very clever, funny and often beautiful film, possessing many qualities that most good films ought to have. For a Pixar film it is also moderately relaxing, which makes it easier for me to watch it. The characters are well developed, including both the new ones and the old ones. Tom Hanks is brilliant as Woody!Basically there are so many things to say about this film. I can hardly list them all, so you will have to watch this for yourself! :-) There are a few things I do not like about it, as well. The part where Andy just leaves Woody is completely un-understandable and the Star Wars spoofs are a little bit too obvious.This film (as you have probably guessed or already know) is about toys that come to life. In this, the cowboy doll Woody is about to go on a Cowboy Camp with his owner Andy, but his arm rips and Andy leaves him! Woody misses Andy, but many other things occur in the meantime...I recommend this to people who like to be relaxed by Pixar Films and for people who still respect toys. Enjoy 'Toy Story 2'! :-)P.S There is a new Toy Story 3 coming out... I hope that's good..!",8,0,1,13 March 2008
Hercules," This is fun.
","Genre: Based on Greek myths, animation, relationships.Actors: Famous ones are Danny DeVito (Phil) and James Woods (Hades).Main characters: Hercules, Zeus, Meg and Hades.What happens: Hercules is the son of the ALL POWERFUL Greek God Zeus. The day Hercules is born, he is captured and made mortal (only three of the characters know how this happens). Someone makes Hercules mortal and then he is adopted by mortal humans. This is only the beginningMessage: That you are a hero if you love as well as fight.My thoughts: I like this film. I think it has more of a potential of being liked to a 8-11 aged audience, as I liked it more than I do now at that age. I still like it because it is very fun, the animation is different, a little weird, but quite good! I also still like the characters, especially Meg and Phil and Hades is funny and I like funny baddies in Disney films. Of course I like all the good Greek Gods, they are somehow potentially likable. I used to like Pain and Panic (Hades's servants) a lot when I was younger, but I'm starting to like them less now because I'm growing up and they are growing a little too silly for my liking. Also this film has a good share of slapstick AND wit in it for my entertainment. I also really like the songs, especially 'Go The Distance' and 'I Won't Say I'm In Love' or whatever it's called. My favourite character is Phil because I like his personality and he also looks kind of cute when he's excited and happy when to most people he's supposed to be quite UGLY (but I don't agree with that). So I like this film! Recommended to: Mainly people who are aged 8-11, people who like animated Disney films and for people who like 'fun' films. Enjoy! :-)7 and a half out of 10.",7,1,2,18 August 2007
Ice Age," Subtle, sweet and hilarious, very good indeed.
","Genre: Prehostoric creatures, animation, comedy, family.Main characters: Manfred the mammoth, Sid the Sloth/Thid the thloth, Diego the Sabretoothed tiger and the baby.What happens: The film starts with a rather determined-to-have-his-acorn creature called Scrat, who in trying to get his acorn, causes a few glaciers to collide. Then you meet Sid and Manny...My thoughts: It looks like Chris Wedge, who had done just little films before this film, could produce a motion picture SO good, that it became a hit at the box office (something which everyone seems to care about...) and it did well otherwise, making loads of people enjoy it all around the world (oh yes and they also put it into many different languages). Yes, this is a good film, no doubt about it. Pretty good use of computer animation, especially in background. The characters are very likable and their lives and personalities are very subtle in a good way (their past is certainly not easy to understand). The jokes are very good, funny and not too unclean (unlike in films such as 'Open Season'). The excitement is also not very high, a few fighting and scary scenes (not too bad for the youngsters though) but apart from that not much. Everyone wants action films nowadays and yet this was a big hit! I just don't understand it.So if you are a CGI liking child or a CGI liking adult, then you will love/like this in some way.Recommended to: Families who like animated films, people who like characters who are subtle and people who are interested in preostoric animals. Enjoy! :-)",8,0,0,12 September 2007
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," This film is a magical spell which many have fallen under.
","Based on the Brothers Grimms' fairytale, this film is about a princess called Snow White who is looked after by her cruel stepmother, who is an evil witch. As long as the witch is the 'fairest one of all', Snow White will be safe... An indescribable amount of people love 'Snow White', probably as their favourite film. Millions of people have fallen under its captivating and entertaining spell, loving the film in every way.This, is indeed a very beautiful film, with memorable characters and very detailed animation, especially for that time. This film also has its laughs and is very cute.No wonder so many people have fallen under 'Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs''s spell! Although, surely there have to be other films out there that people could love just as much, or maybe even more?This is not the best film in the world, but it CERTAINLY isn't the worst and everyone who watches it will like it in least one way. This film was also the start of the Disney company's fabulous line of animated films, good and less good. Ah well. Enjoy 'Snow White'. :-)",7,2,3,19 September 2007
The Lion King," The perfect film to make you happy when you're upset! :)
","Previously when I'd watched this, I liked it, but I preferred many other Disney films. Re- watching this film cheered me up when I was sad right then and there! For those of you who don't know, this is the story of a lion cub called Simba who's future king. He lives on Pride Rock with his loving parents and his friend Nala, a girl lion cub. When he goes into a place he was told not to go, it is only the start of a mesmerising and exciting adventure...I love this film for the five main reasons. Reason 1: I like all the characters in this except Scar, the main baddie. He annoys me just slightly (although I like his voice). Reason 2: The scenery portrays a beautiful vision of Africa and it makes me feel like I'm really there. Reason 3: The plot is very beautiful and it has made me want to read 'Hamlet' on which the plot was based! Reason 4: This film has beautiful songs! My favourite is 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight?' (written by Elton John) but I love all the others as well. Reason 5: I love the voices that were picked for all the characters. I especially like the sound of Jeremy Iron's (Scar), Rowan Atkinson's (Zazu), Nathan Lane's (Timon), Whoopi Goldberg's (Shenzi), James Earl Jones's (Mufasa) and Moira Kelly's (adult Nala) voices!WARNING! For those of you who are upset by goodies dying in films, then I suggest you use the fast forward button on your remote control when Mufasa leaps up on a rock ledge in the stampede until you see Scar walking towards Simba and Mufasa.Otherwise, enjoy one of my favourite classic Disneys! :) ;) :()",8,1,1,25 February 2007
WALL·E," A beautiful, beautiful film, 10/10 all the way!! + it is very (X 200) cute!!
","I was sure this film would be good, but there were a few surprises...1. I did not realize that the love between Wall.E and Eve would be so strong.2. I did not realize how much the humans in this film have changed from the ones now.3. I did not realize that there would be some sudden points in this film and some scary points in the film.4. I did not realize there would be a baddie.These surprises did not totally distract me from the best parts of the film, which are the very beginning and when Wall.E and Eve are in love. They are two robots, Wall.E has been on earth for 700 years, cleaning up earth which is covered in rubbish. Every day Wall.E puts the rubbish into bricks and builds towers of it. Anything that he finds interesting, he takes it back to his little 'house'. In the first fifteen minutes or so of the film, Wall.E meets a little cockroach, one of the first living creatures he has seen, then he finds a plant, which he has never seen before. He takes this into his house. Later, a robot named Eve, from space, where every human now lives, comes down to earth to search for signs of life. Wall.E falls in love with her and after some misunderstanding between them, Wall.E manages to show Eve his little house, some of his things and the plant. Eve is programmed to now be taken back to space, to show this plant to the humans, so that they can return to earth. Wall.E is so lonely on earth, that he decides to come with her...I love this film because of the beautiful Pixar graphics, Wall.E, Eve and the way they love each other. The environmental message shown in this film is very good and if everyone who watches this film pays attention to that message, the world could start becoming a better place. Unfortunately, I have a feeling people are not understanding this message and so, are still not taking action.I recommend this film to anyone who likes Pixar graphics, who do not mind films that are a little bit slow and like Wall.E! Enjoy 'Wall.E'!! :-) :-)",10,3,6,2 August 2008
The Terminal," Very good
","I had known a little bit about this weird and wonderful film before I watched it, because mum had watched (because of Tom Hanks, she LOVES Tom Hanks) and liked it. She had told me the basic plot and why she watched it (I repeat, because of Tom Hanks). When I watched it as well less than a month ago, I liked it and I still (of course) do! It's pretty weird and a little slow-going at parts, so I suggest chatting to someone while watching it to keep you focused. Otherwise, this weird and wonderful film is good! :)A man from 'Krakozhia' with little English, has ended up stuck in one of the terminals of New York airport. While he cannot go anywhere (OOPS), he spends time earning money, meeting a regular woman visitor...",8,0,1,28 May 2007
Mary and Max," A truly unusually brilliant film.
","I was tempted to give this film ten stars, but 'Mary and Max' seems to give the message that Aspies and Autistic people shouldn't be 'cured' in any way, which is not the case. I was lucky enough to watch this at a pre-release screening in Scotland and I must say I am very glad I watched 'Mary and Max'. Not only is it well-animated, but the ideas presented, the ironic, black humour and the storyline are simply spectacular. When I saw an advert for this film the animation reminded me of Tim Burton animations such as 'The Nightmare Before Christmas', but it is a totally different from anything like that. There are many adult themes and black jokes presented in this film, meaning I would not recommend it for anyone under the age of twelve, simply because it is too good to misunderstand. I will continue this review by commenting on each of the aspects in turn.Dialogue and storyline: This film is very well written. The idea of a young girl writing to a 40 year old man with Asperger's is one which is not only very unexpected, but very clever. It allows not only an intelligent, at times funny script, but it also allows the viewer to understand more about Aspies and the world in general. Some of the humour included is very funny, but at the same time this film also has very sad parts. Overall, this film is not to be taken lightly.Animation and filming: This film is almost solely plasticine animation, which gives it an appropriately nostalgic style, along with the sepia and black and white filming. The life of the Australian girl is sepia, in browns like her birthmark and eyes. The life of the American is black and white, reflecting how gloomy most of his experiences are.Themes: The themes presented include: Asperger's Syndrome, Depression, Alcoholism, Homophobia, Communism, Psychology, Processed foods, Sweet foods, Blindness and Suicide, among many others. Some of these may not be apparent to younger or even very Aspie viewers, to truly understand this view one needs quite a wide knowledge of the world. The themes are either dealt with in a comic or melancholy way, each leaving its own imprint on the film and making it more entertaining.As I mentioned above, the only thing that I disliked about this film is how the makers hint that people with Asperger's should be left pretty much as they are. Some Aspies can do with therapy or guidance in life to make sure they cope with normal people. The therapist that Max has in this film is shown to be a bad therapist, but now there are many different methods for teaching Aspies and Autistic people how to become more normal, while still appreciating many of their Aspie traits.Overall I recommend this to anyone who wants more of an idea of people with Asperger's, Aspies themselves, or pretty much anyone over the age of 12 who can deal with a rather depressing film. I hope you find 'Mary and Max' worth watching! :-)",9,5,10,7 October 2010
Shrek," Hilarious, a job well done.
","This is the first of the very popular and very famous Shrek films. In fact, there is about 60% chance that you - yes you, right there, have watched it already. If not, I have to tell you that you're missing out on a good opportunity for laughing your head off (not literally, obviously, or otherwise I would have killed myself about 50 times already) and entertaining yourself.If you have not yet watched this, you'll probably know what happens, anyway. There is an ogre called Shrek who is rather ugly and everyone hates him, which is not totally surprising. When every single fairytale creature (like the seven dwarfs and the three little pigs) is turned up in his swamp, Shrek decides to make sure that they leave. Along with his new companion, an annoying donkey (voiced by the very good Eddie Murphy), Shrek goes off to find the person who placed all the fairytale creatures in his swamp...Very fun for the whole family, I recommend this to EVERYONE aged 5 and above, otherwise there will be little point to watching this film (you may not get the jokes if you are under 5). Most people who have watched 'Shrek' enjoy it and if you have not yet watched it, I hope you find it as good as I did - or better! Enjoy 'Shrek'! :-)",8,0,1,19 July 2008
Cinderella," Beautiful.
","For quite a long time in my life, I either did not like this film, or I liked this film but not as much as many more. I watched it recently (at a sleepover, funnily enough) and I liked it more than I had done since I was under 6 or something. I now appreciate it more, as I do with a few other Disney classics that I have watched recently (including 'Sleeping Beauty' and 'Pinnochio' or however you spell it). I now very much appreciate the animation, the clever 'Disney' plot turns, the humour from the mice, the emotions expressed and the plot. The animation is very well done, often it seems you are wherever the other characters are, watching them. The animation also does well portraying the styles of the backgrounds, including the town (which is shown twice briefly). Disney changes this from the original fairy tale in a surprisingly good way, injecting clever plot turns ,such as the mice making the clothes and the key part (usually I do not like Disney films very much if they are not that similar to the original story, but with this I am not overly bothered. I feel they made necessary changes to make this a good Disney film. Often I do not think Disney changed the book in a good way in some of their films). You know the story already, Cinderella is a girl working for her horrible stepmother and stepsisters. She goes to a ball with the help of her fairy godmother and loses a glass slipper...This is a film very much to be watched with other people. Immediate family is not good enough. To enjoy this, I recommend you watch it with friends (and immediate family, if you like. :-) ). I recommend this to people who like Disney at least a little bit, people who like fairy tales and for people who like mice. Enjoy! :-)",8,0,0,16 June 2008
Aladdin," A very fun film, better for older people!
","I do not want to insult anybody or let anybody take this statement in the wrong light, but: I think this film is a great deal better for people aged 12 and over. Why? Because I think that there is so much 'adult' humour to be enjoyed in this film that little children do not need to watch it. But I am not saying they should not! Little children will like the characters, the adventures and the songs, which is perfectly hunky dory, but they will miss the humour, which is perhaps the best part of this film. The humour is provided mainly by Robin Williams who voices the genie and Gilbert Gottfried, who voices Iago the parrot. In this very good animated Disney film, we meet Jafar, the Sultan's evil adviser, who is trying to find a magic lamp, with a genie which will make him Sultan. We also meet Aladdin, a street rat, with no money and stealing everything he needs. We meet Jasmine, princess Jasmine, who does not want to marry any of the suitors her father, the Sultan, is offering her to marry. Soon enough, an adventure will begin between these characters - and more...I recommend this to anyone who has a sense of humour and to anyone who likes Disney films. I will say this: Anyone of any age can watch this film, but people who understand more grown-up humour will enjoy this more. Enjoy 'Aladdin'! :-)",8,1,1,7 August 2008
Happy Feet," 7 and a 1/2 out of ten, beautiful, but weirdly sad.
","When I first saw the advert of this, I thought it was going to be a happy film, with a few baddies and the plot it had. Unfortunately, I didn't know it was going to be this sad. I felt extremely sorry for Mumble, who was unloved and teased by thousands of penguins just because he couldn't sing! The Adelie penguins are MUCH more sensible about the whole mating thing (not just in this film). They just give their girlfriend a pebble and - voila! They can now mate! Mumble seems a little aspie (asperger's syndrome is a form of autism and autism is a difference in people), which made things interesting, but it also made things sadder and meaner because Mumble was teased. The animated film is about a little penguin chick called Mumble, who loves to dance. His parents hope he'll grow out of it. Unfortunately, he can't, but what makes things worse for him and for his parents, is that he can't sing - and that means he isn't a proper emperor penguin...I like this film for its animation, ROBIN WILLAMS (!! :) ), most of its characters and some of its excitement. Enjoy!P.S If you thought this was going to be a happy film, then I suggest you think a while before watching this. This isn't all the title says.",7,0,1,15 April 2007
Pocahontas," This film is my favourite Disney - it is so beautiful and exciting!
","Genre: Animated film based on the real life of Pochahontas. Set in America with Native Americans.Personally, I don't see how this movie could have so many bad reviews. It is BEAUTIFUL AND EXCITING PLUS MUCH MORE!!!!!!!!This film is about a Native American woman called (obviously) Pochahontas. She watches English people arrive in America to take over. She meets one Englishman called John Smith. Can Pochahontas teach John how to respect the earth and not help take over (Sorry, you have to watch to find out, I won't keep you posted)?I absolutely love this film for five main reasons. Reason 1: I love all the characters, even the main baddie - he has a good voice etc. My three favourite characters are Pochahontas, John Smith and Meeko (I am one of their biggest fans). Reason 2: This film is based on real life. It is very interesting to watch the only Disney classic to be based on real life. Reason 3: I love the animation, drawings and backgrounds! They are beautiful and very life-like at times. Sometimes you feel very close to the Native Americans the animation is so good. Reason 4: I love all the songs, my favourite is 'Colours Of The Wind.' I also like 'Just Around The Riverbend' (It's got my favourite quote: 'What I love about rivers is, you can't step in the same river twice. The water's always changing, always flowing.'). Reason 5: It isn't funny, yet it isn't serious either. It has jokes dropped in at appropriate times, which I like.So watch this movie, you're guaranteed NOT to dislike it!! :) ;) :()",10,2,6,17 February 2007
The Simpsons Movie," Very amusing and entertaining.
","Like the series, the film is amusing, entertaining and exciting. Despite being a wee bit gory and pushing the jokes somewhat, this film will with no doubt entertain a wide audience, adults and children alike. This is the sort of film that if you watch once, you CERTAINLY won't catch quite ALL the jokes.A bit surprisingly for something about the Simpsons, this film concerns environmental issues. It starts with Greenday and Lisa having problems with telling people about the environment. Next Homer's dad has a 'vision from God' in Church and maniacally foretells of misfortune to come, in the form of a twisted tail etc. Marge particularly feels that bad stuff is soon going to happen and when Homer spots a pig with a chef's hat it seems like it will come all too soon...Enjoy the hilarious, exciting, engaging, disgusting Simpsons Movie! :-)7 and a half out of ten.",7,0,1,17 December 2007
The Wizard of Oz," Very gorgeous and beautiful - but is it the best?
","People have described this film as captivating, the best, most charming film they have ever seen. For some people there are a great deal many films they would prefer, but with no doubt it is likely every person will like this a wee bit in some wee way! One thing to congratulate is the special effects, which a lot of people do not seem to go on about. For the film's time, the special effects were probably the most special since films were invented (to some people anyway). Of course some of the ways they made illusions were easy, but very clever. Others were harder to make, such as the tornado and the flying monkeys.Other good points on the quality of the film are the superb acting, the way it was filmed, the scenes and the way the script was written - despite some points being not completely similar to the book. The characters of the film are very likable, especially the main four: Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion. Toto the dog is a delight too. The songs are very beautiful and entertaining - so is the fun dancing - avid young dancers may feel they want to get up and dance along with Dorothy, the Scarecrow and the Tin Man as they move their feet! One thing that just about everyone who watches this film will like, is the charm of the story and the characters, which is probably why this film has (sort of) gone down in history. Indeed this film is very likable and pretty captivating, a good job!The film starts in sepia to capture the mood of the setting - an old farm in Kansas and the rather dreary mood. The girl called Dorothy wishes to go to some other place and to help save her beloved dog from the stubborn Miss Gulch - who wants the dog after he annoyed her. When Toto is taken away and then escapes to return to Dorothy, it is the last straw for the girl, she is going to run away... That isn't all that happens, the plot twists and turns in a dramatic way.Enjoy 'The Wizard Of Oz'!7 and a half out of ten.",7,4,8,28 October 2007
