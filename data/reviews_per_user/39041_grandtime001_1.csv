Black Swan," Awful pretentious movie
","Artsy mishmash of a movie. Felt myself bored, waiting for something significant to happen. Lots of close up shots of Natalie Portman, being full of herself as usual. Movie basically didn't go anywhere or have a really interesting plot. The only interesting thing was the director of the ballet trying to get in her pants. Otherwise lesbian sex, boring plot line. Expected way more from all the hype. There is a lot of focus on Natalie and her awful relationship with her mom. She also goes out to party. It felt like she was trying to find herself throughout this movie. I yawned, almost fell asleep. It seems like it tries too hard to be something its not. I personally hated it, but apparently im not in the majority.",1,35,82,24 December 2010
