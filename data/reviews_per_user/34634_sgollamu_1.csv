The Legend of Bagger Vance," Your trite Hollywood Movie
","This was your normal feel good movie, but after reading the book, this movie is not the greatest. I'm not knocking the actors because Matt Damon was a good, but the screen play just played old suck. They butchered the book and made it into a romance. There was so much meaning in the book about life. It was all lost in the movie trying to make a trite Hollywood movie. Will Smith as Bagger Vance was an awful decision and should have been some like Morgan Freeman. I know that normally movies are not as good as books. However in the case, it was completely off base. If you want to appreciate the movie, then don't read the book. If you want to something to inspire you, then read the book.",5,3,7,15 October 2005
