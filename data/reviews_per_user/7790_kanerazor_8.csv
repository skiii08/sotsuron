Spartacus," Epic cinema at its finest
","Stanley Kubrick essentially disowned this movie, saying it was not really his work.  It's true that Anthony Mann directed the first half, and the movie on the whole lacks trademark touches of Kubrick, who was basically a director for hire.  There's a reason you don't find this in his box sets.Having said all that, this is a movie anyone should be THRILLED to have on his resume.  It's rare you find something that shoots so high and makes a bullseye.  Certain things, such as the extremely long time at the beginning we simply watch a blank screen while music plays, would have come across as pretentious and irritating in most anything else, yet it's okay here because this movie doesn't just act like it's a larger than life masterpiece, it delivers the goods!  The sets and location shooting are breathtaking at many times; the sight of the hundreds of slaves marching into battle made my jaw drop.  And there's plenty of substance beneath the style; the story line is gripping and goes far beyond that of many similar movies in terms of complexity.  As far as the performances, they are uniformly great.  Kirk Douglas, a stellar leading man, suits the title role perfectly, Laurence Olivier is amazingly detestable as the villain, and the supporting cast, which includes Jean Simmons, Tony Curtis, and Charles Laughton, is highlighted by Peter Ustinov's justly Oscar winning performance.  Despite a 3 hours+ running time, Spartacus is never once boring, and despite being a rabble rousing film about a hero, is never once predictable or cliche.  The famous 'I'm Spartacus' scene towards the end has been parodied many times, and it's easy to see why it made such a huge impression on filmgoers.  Works like this are among the best examples of 'movie magic' and it should be required viewing for any film school student!",10,3,6,20 March 2002
Chinatown," Exciting, captivating, and harrowing-one of the greatest films ever made!
","Chinatown is one of the rare films that showcases the absolute full potential of the Hollywood dream factory. Everything about this film is absolutely perfect. It's really a shame that Chinatown came out the same year as The Godfather Part II (which is my favorite movie ever) and only got an original screenplay Oscar-virtually ANY OTHER YEAR it would have easily gotten Best Picture and Director, and who knows what else.The story alone makes this a classic thriller. Robert Towne really put together an incredible screenplay, which requires you to pay close attention to figure out everything happening but is worth every bit of the effort. As all the pieces of the puzzle come together, the film just gets more and more mesmerizing. The dialogue is incredible; I can count on one hand the number of films I've seen that were as quotable. The highlights are the exchanges between Gittes and Cross, as well as the famous scene with Gittes and Evelyn. The film remains incredibly absorbing right up until the devastating finale. Polanski had to fight Towne to put that ending on there, but for good reason. This ending left me horrified, but Chinatown just would not have been the same movie without it. Polanski directs the entire thing brilliantly-he evokes so many different emotions out of the viewers just right and leaves us with the feeling that we have just been exposed to events that should have remained hidden, if only to prevent emotional scars.The acting is uniformly excellent, from the leads to Escobar and Yelburton to Evelyn's servants to the farmers in the San Fernando Valley, and everyone in between. That includes the director himself in a very gory cameo. I want to talk about the leads. Jack Nicholson is an actor who I used to think was very overrated. I'd primarily seen his films in the past 15 years or so, and thought he always played himself, complete with grinning and rudeness. When I saw Chinatown though, I was blown away. There is one scene where he's telling the dirty joke and seems like JACK, but other than that there is not a trace of the regular character. Gittes is a cynical, wounded private eye who at first is simply trying to make a living, then clear his name, and then finds himself in love and wanting to care and protect in spite of himself. Nicholson nails every aspect of the performance, and after watching him here I went out to see other early works of his such as Five Easy Pieces. John Houston is also exceptional, playing one of the most contemptible villains ever, and my guess as to the reason he wasn't nominated for Best Supporting Actor is simply because the Academy hated his character far too much.However, I think Faye Dunaway deserves the most praise here. She delivers one of the best performances I've ever seen by an actress in any movie. At first Evelyn is so icy (I've heard some even call her a femme fatale, even though that label is certainly not appropriate once you watch the entire film) and we wonder what she could possibly be hiding. Then later we see that she is in great pain, but can only wonder why. I was especially moved by her when she softly told Gittes 'Please believe me; I would never have hurt Hollis. He was the kindest most gentle man and you wouldn't believe what he had to go through for me.' After the revelation, I found myself never having cared about a movie character more. I haven't seen Dunaway's other starring roles, but it's clear why she was one of the top actresses of the 1970s, and I'm glad she won Best Actress for Network two years after this.I've made an effort not to spoil anything in this remarkable film. Anyone who wants to see everything a movie can be needs to experience Chinatown.",10,0,2,22 February 2003
Cloverfield," Tremendous thrills!
","Some people have derisively compared this film to The Blair Witch Project because it was all told from the point of view of someone's shaking camera. Unless you have motion sickness, I don't think that's a bad thing. What matters is who's in front of the camera. While The Blair Witch Project featured annoying people screaming at each other, this movie actually made me care about the characters. In fact if it had continued with the romantic drama tone established during the first half hour, I STILL think it would have been worth watching and that's the biggest compliment I can give it.Of course people will be watching this movie for the visceral pleasure and Colverfield delivers. Many thrilling visual and sound effects wowed me (there were a few times I yelled out in shock at a sudden scare). Any horror film will also benefit from a sense of entrapment and this movie pulls off the seemingly impossible feat of making New York City seem claustrophobic because there was seemingly nowhere to hide from the monster.What is the monster? Whatever it is clearly is meant to be an allegory for the carnage 9/11 inflicted on New York, much the same way Godzilla was meant to be an allegory for the damage inflicted on Japan by the atom bomb. There are moments seemingly recreating the documentary footage from 9/11, and they give the film verisimilitude. Touching upon real life horror, plus creating characters that we can relate to and care about, and assaulting our senses with incredible sights and sounds leads to entertainment worth watching many times over. Perhaps the 80 minute run time will bother some people, but on the other hand I think that's better than a film wearing out its welcome. Great job J.J. Abrams and company!",9,1056,1742,15 January 2008
Barry Lyndon," Kubrick's unheralded work of art
","Warning: Plot spoilers aheadStanley Kubrick made many a masterpiece, no film lover would deny that. It's unfortunate however, that Barry Lyndon is often cited as a failure on his part, for it is breathtaking by any standards.  It is beautifully constructed; not the least of its merits are the gorgeous sets, the haunting score (right up there with that from A Clockwork Orange), and the dazzling use of natural light.  The screenplay also deserves praise, with the cryptic 'spoiling' narration being an oddly effective touch.  We the viewers are made to care about Barry's well being; I for one was rooting for his happiness in the beginning and was deeply saddened by his ultimate fate. In particular, I agree with the opinion of David Hughes, author of 'The Complete Kubrick': the death of Barry's young son Bryan is one of the most heartbreaking scenes ever committed to cinema.  Leon Vitali does a great job as Lord Bullingdon (especially during the intense climactic duel) but Ryan O'Neal in the title role is the film's one weakness.  An actor with more charisma and range would have been better suited; O'Neal seems to be phoning it in at times.  However, he is still an appealing star, and does not diminish the quality in any way.All in all, this movie is long and slowly paced, and unlike most everything you've seen.  It's not for all tastes, but if you like cinematic art, please give it a chance.A very enthusiastic 9/10.",10,3,4,5 March 2002
Paths of Glory," Smashing!
","This movie does not get the recognition it deserves; it is not only one of Kubrick's best works but one of the best films of any director I have ever seen.  It made little impact at the Oscars that year, and never shows up on things like the AFI 100 Years 100 Movies list, but it's great that IMDB users have placed it so high in the Top 250.  That inspired me to see it, and hopefully will many others.  For those who don't know, it's about an impossible attack during World War I that fails, and how the piggish army generals make three innocent subordinates the scapegoats and have them sentenced to death.  The movie is absolutely heart-wrenching without having to resort to the slightest bit of manipulation; I found myself wanting to lash out at the screen at times because I was so furious at the injustice of the matter.  Adolphe Menjou really sinks his teeth into the role of the main heavy, and Kirk Douglas is just exceptional as the angry officer fighting futilely for justice.  The interactions between the two of them are among the best dramatic scenes you will find anywhere, and the trial is horrifying, and yet so gripping.  At times such as the final scene, the movie is too poignant at times for me to even do justice with words.  All I can say is SEE IT!  It's a 10/10!!!!",10,0,1,14 March 2002
Iron Man," A blast-one of the best comic book movies!
","Iron Man provides about as much fun as one could ask. While it lacks the emotional punch of films such as Superman: The Movie or Batman Begins, the film has many virtues going for it and could be enjoyed any number of times.The movie has some of the most visually inventive special effects I have ever seen. Watching all of Tony's inventions come to life consistently put a smile on my face. Plus the humor in the film is considerable. Jon Favreau knows how to brighten a viewer's day, and the film never ceases to be a joyous crowd pleaser.The cast adds to Iron Man tremendously. I'm not usually a Gwyneth Paltrow fan, but she knew how to add spice to the role of the loyal love interest and she shared great chemistry with the hero. Terrence Howard makes a strong right hand man; all of Tony's goofy indulgences were made that much more entertaining by the contrast with his responsible, endearingly square best friend. Plus the caring bond between the two of them gave the film more heart. Jeff Bridges isn't given the kind of memorable villain role the likes of Willem Dafoe and Terence Stamp have gotten in the past. The movie is sometimes too light for its own good and the good vs. evil battle is not that compelling. However, Bridges is one of the best actors in history and he still manages to create a character we love to hate. Of course the most entertaining supporting character may have been the robot...However the unquestionable star of this show is Robert Downey Jr., who elevated the film to another level entirely using his magnificent charisma. I found myself wanting to applaud Tony Stark even when he was at his most hedonistic, because he was just that charming. And when he chose to be a superhero, you'd be hard pressed to find someone you'd want to root for more. Downey of course proved himself to be too human in the past, but after years of his being clean his talent has finally taken over and brought him the role of a lifetime.Here's hoping Iron Man lives on forever and its gifted star is only beginning his reign as a major Hollywood force!",9,3,6,30 April 2008
Signs," Lame, Lame, Lame
","I loved The Sixth Sense as much as anyone and Unbreakable is one of my favorite movies (yes, Unbreakable, and I'll defend it to no end) so I was highly disappointed by this one. Let's just say I have a whole bunch of issues with this movie.1)The entire thing was an overlong second rate version of Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds.2)Those were real birds and they're still terrifying, which is a lot more than I can say for some idiot in a bright green Halloween costume.3)Why would the aliens, with all their brilliance that enables them to travel galaxies, try to conquer a planet that's 65% covered by the substance that kills them! Some people have tried using the defense that it's holy water, but that doesn't explain why Dr. Reddy thought they were afraid of the lake. This is just a huge plot hole. What's with Shyamalan's water phobia? I thought that was OK as David Dunne's weak point, but why would he use the same thing twice? It didn't make sense here.4) That whole 'swing away' twist. I'm sorry, I have nothing to say about that other than I thought it was COMPLETELY RETARDED! 5)The ending was much too heavy handed. Shayamalan may as well have had God personally come down and tell the aliens 'Leave the Hess family alone!' No one hits a home run every time, and I was willing to overlook this misstep by Night and still be excited about his next film. After seeing The Village, however...",5,1,2,19 April 2005
Cinderella Man," Disappointingly routine sports biopic
","While I enjoyed this movie very much watching it, it's resonated with me so little I'd tell anyone who asks that it's just okay. I'd give it a slight recommendation, but only as a period piece, b/c it does a somewhat moving job recapturing the feel of the Great Depression. The characters are so flat I felt like I never even met them. The hero is just a complete saint and the villain so evil he brags about the fact that he killed an opponent. And of course, the hero must win so that he can keep his angelic family together and happy. When they pile stuff on like that, of course it's completely obvious what's gonna happen.Perhaps some more focus on Braddock's career would have established him as an underdog much better. As it is, we see his early great days, then jump ahead to the depression where we see how much pain his family's in, and when he decides to box again it's mentioned in passing how his career went downhill after one fight. We do see a fight where he does poorly, but that's not enough. The championship match is apparently the greatest upset in boxing history, and I wasn't getting that vibe at all.Perhaps some more focus on the depression would have been better. Paddy Considine had a memorable supporting character, but he's barely there. I think some newsreel clips or some more stuff in the 'Hoovervilles' would have been great. The tagline says Braddock brought America to its feet when it was on its knees, so maybe if I got a better sense of how on its knees the country was the victory would have been much more inspiring. As it is almost everything is about Braddock and his wife, and they have such great hearts that of course they can't wind up unhappy! Maybe it would have been better if they gave the wife part to a character actress, instead of Renee Zellwegger who'd insist on hogging screen time. Oh excuse me, ACADEMY AWARD WINNER RENEE ZELWEGGER! Of course I'm biased b/c I can't stand her, so even though I love Russell Crowe I definitely didn't care about the family's togetherness.Perhaps some more focus on the opponent Max Baer would have been great. I heard the new book about the fight by Jeremy Schaap focuses on both fighters, and that sounds like an interesting read. Apparently Baer spent the rest of his life remorseful about the fighter he killed, and he was one of the most popular champions ever. In the movie he's such a monster I couldn't take him seriously-the character was out of place in a drama as serious in tone as this one. I at least liked the goofy charm Craig Bierko brought to the part, in what I hope's a star making performance. Baer seemed kind of like a dopey monster as played by him-he actually reminded me of Biff in Back to the Future. Again, not a serious threat, but the only character who I thought brought some life to the proceedings. Paul Giamatti's one of my favorite actors, but I just thought he was given a typical gruff trainer role to work with here.The movie's been mentioned as the first serious Oscar contender of the year, but I think the only areas where it deserves consideration are art decoration and cinematography.",6,3,6,11 June 2005
