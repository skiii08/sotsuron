The Blair Witch Project," Not Too Impressed
","I went to see 'The Blair Witch Project' with 2 of my friends on opening day at my local theater(7/30/99), and to be honest, I  did not find it to be that scary...In fact we spent a good majority of the movie laughing at the film. I think the reason I found it to be so boring was that I had heard film critics rave about how scary it was, and probably expected too much from it. I can see how you could be scared if you really got into the movie and put yourself in their place, but I just had a hard time doing so. The only time I screamed during the whole movie, in fact, was when the lights came back on and I realized I had just wasted ten bucks. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that at times it succeeds at being spooky(The 3 piles of rocks by the tent, for those of you who have seen it), but due to the fact that you find out at the opening scene that the characters are already dead, it really kills any suspense the film could offer. I really enjoyed the fact that the movie was recorded using home video cameras and DATs(It made it all too  believable and realistic). So, I guess all I can say for 'The Blair Witch Project' is that as a film I found it original and realistic, but for a horror movie there was little/no suspense(which in my opinion makes a scary flick).",8,1,1,30 July 1999
