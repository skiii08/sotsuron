Requiem for a Dream," a wannabe Trainspotting
","After watching the above movie again, I was reminded of how much Requiem for a Dream resembles it (from Requiem's initial scene of the television theft, to the more general theme of hopeless drug addictions).  And yet it also became more apparent to me how poorly Requiem compares to the British masterpiece, particularly in the method of direction by Darren Aronofsky. To me, his style in this film was reminiscent of the early commercial for DVD players -- catchy, yet in a choppy/gimmicky/dizzying way.  Nowhere near worthy of its high rating.  3/10.",3,14,29,22 January 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," critics are, well, critics
","... and they need to get paid for criticizing something, even when the criticism isn't necessarily appropriate.I'm not sure what the naysayers were expecting from the movie, but I found it to be a fitting end to a stylish and thought-provoking trilogy. Naturally, I was disappointed by Reloaded like most people (how could any sequel realistically live up to the first Matrix?).  But most of Revolutions I found riveting and almost beautiful, especially the ending.Last point, albeit a personal one: I saw this movie during a weekend getaway in Vegas with some friends, and the deeper universal themes of the film will be what I remember most about the trip.  8/10.",8,2,4,11 November 2003
American History X," a movie like this needs to be made, but...
","... really not in such a shabby fashion.  Tony Kaye's direction leaves much to be desired, and the musical decisions within the film make you feel like you're watching The Last of the Mohicans, and not a contemporary film about race.  Derek Vinyard's transformation from skinhead to savior is admirable, but even this main character's development is done poorly, as are the other roles.  The plot (though somewhat lacking in sophistication) is engaging enough, yet Edward Norton's superb acting alone saves this piece from being completely unwatchable -- further convincing this viewer how much better this movie would have been under different direction.  I'm sad to conclude that this is yet another movie highly undeserving of its lofty ranking. 6/10.",6,1,3,6 February 2003
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," clever, funny
","Rounders meets Trainspotting.  Perhaps a bit too flashy and overcooked at times, and it might take more than one viewing to make sense of the plot and the myriad of characters, but definitely worth a look if you liked the two aforementioned flicks.  Not your everyday dumb Hollywood crap. 9/10.",9,1,2,10 February 2003
