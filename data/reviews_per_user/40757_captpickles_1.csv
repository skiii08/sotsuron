Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Best movie I have scene in a long time
","Jagshemash!! Non-stop laughter seriously EVERY scene was funny, I have never scene a movie like it before. After watching the movie I noticed a bunch of the scenes I had already looked at on youtube and google vids, this made no difference because they are amazing anyway. The best thing in the whole movie though is the car that he drives it is quit possibly the funniest thing in the whole movie. Whenever it cuts to him driving this thing you can't help but smile. The only thing I cant understand is how he doesn't get hit, stabbed or shot doing this stuff because you can tell some of it is fake but a lot of it is real and peoples reactions tell it all. O ya the car he drives is a 1972 AMC Ice Cream Truck. If you have one I am looking to buy it. All in all GREAT SUCCESS!!!",10,3,15,4 November 2006
