Requiem for a Dream," Scared straight with Art
","Directed by Darren Aronofsky, co-wrote by Aronofsky with the original author Hubert Selby (who also wrote 'Last Exit to Brooklyn'), and starring Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlan Wayans, Chris McDonald, Louise Lasser, and Sean Gullette. From the very start, Aronofsky forces you to question reality, and only deepens it from there. The characters, seemingly neurotic by not insane, follow paths that could easily take them straight into Hell but you give them the faith  for awhile  that they're not that stupid and they'll find their way through, especially with one another's awkward but well-intentioned help. The camera, sound design, and scoring (Kronos Quartet  excellent) are complex and shattering, eerie, violent, distorted, and completely supportive of the increasing problems. Acting, especially by Burstyn, is fantastic. She has the toughest role, but as the story goes along, you see that more and more is asked of each actor. Connelly, Leto, Wayans... they all begin to fill their destinies, and they bring a lot to the roles. This is a strong, in your face, unique film that IS Art, but will also serve as a major tool in scaring your kid straight  away from drugs. Guaranteed.",Null,1,2,13 November 2007
Marie Antoinette," Overwhelming decadence
","Starring Kirsten Dunst, the mildly talented Jason Swartzman, nearly unrecognizable Molly Shannon and Judy Davis, and I challenge you to spot Marianne Faithful. Let's get the problem out of the way first: the film uses recent music, including Gang of Four. Not a good idea. Yes, I understand not only attempts to 'sell' a movie to a younger audience, and to give a 'flavor' of youth to the new monarchy, but this was NOT the way to do it. If anything, using more contemporary sounds  perhaps with traditional instruments  or some other exploration might have worked, but Sophia Coppola's directing fell down here. Okay, on to the rest of the film: It is SO much better than I expected! The sets, costuming, camera work, lighting, dialog, and acting were wonderful. The decadence was overwhelming, and though you NEVER see the impoverished, starving French peasants (because you're viewing the world through Marie), YOU KNOW they are out there, YOU know this is incredibly decadent, and you KNOW from your history what is coming. Marie's social and psychic transition from Austria to France is a surreal leap into the looking glass. Any excesses Marie found or created were to divert her attention from the crushing rituals and pettiness of the French courts. Had it not been for the score of 'Marie Antoinette', I would have NO hesitations about this film. None.",Null,1,2,6 November 2007
United 93," If you're afraid, you've been ill-advised
","Let's get one thing out of the way: I take seriously the attacks on New York, Washington D.C., and the skies over America - and I have not forgotten or mellowed over the last five years. Nor do I have patience for any one, Oliver Stone included, 'dramatizing' or 'fictionalizing' the facts of a historic moment. For this reason first, but not solely, I support 'United 93' and Paul Greengrass' super-effort to make the facts and emotions of that day as true as possible within the confines of film.Does this mean his film is without Art? Not at all, but it DOES mean the only artistic devices he used were to assist the sense of reality that existed for those people during that time. I've heard 'complaints' about the use of a shaking camera, but that is ONLY done as the tension and violence occur. It was the RIGHT thing to do for the film at that time, and a viewer's inner ear problems are of no concern to me. I want an artist to take me places I haven't been. If it's uncomfortable, so be it.I VERY MUCH appreciated the total lack of recognizable actors. It was a brave decision on the director's part. 'Selling' the film would be much more difficult, if not the Kiss of Death, in our market. Greengrass was willing to stick by his artistic and story telling intentions. And, because he did, we are gifted with a powerful, accurate, straight ahead, non-gimmicky, emotional recreation of a terrible moment. This is a highly SPECIFIC film, not one loaded with parallels and symbols. If you are AVOIDING it because you've heard it's VERY bloody, etc., it's not. You've been ill-advised. It IS very tense. THAT it is. It is also very sad, and the unknown actors need to be given credit for that. If I remember correctly, Greengrass also used original participants, such as in the control towers, for the added accuracy and feel of time and place. It must've been difficult for those people.I doubt 'United 93' was easy for anyone, and it remains a challenge for us. Thankfully. I'd hate to think someone DID find it easy.",Null,3,5,28 October 2006
Training Day," Denzel finally breaks image.
","'Training Day' (2002): The BEST 'corrupt cop' movie since 'Serpico', made decades back. Ethan Hawke plays a rookie police officer assigned to Denzel Washington, the savvy, intense, in-real-deep corrupt cop. The story covers just ONE day...a VERY LONG day. Both men do incredible jobs with their characters, and although the story got a little over-the-top on a couple of occasions, this is a sharp edged, superb drama with lots of insight, and action. Photography, pacing, scoring, dialogit ALL adds up to a high quality, tense experience. I would think that Washington was very glad to take on a role such as this, after so many 'honorable downtrodden black men' roles. He was on the verge of being irretrievably typecast, at least with me. I cannot imagine any REAL actor wanting to be locked into a single image.",Null,0,11,28 June 2005
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Dead-on accuracy
","Over the last thirty years, I've noticed that this film vs their earlier film 'The Holy Grail' is debated like Woody Allen's earlier films vs 'Annie Hall' and later. It's the Olde silly/slapstick vs the cerebral debate. Holy Grail is fun, and has a ton of wonderful commentaries on culture, history, multiple-realities, AND debunks everything humans create...yet it somehow comes off as sillier than Life of Brian. They are BOTH worth seeing. Let the nitpicking come to an end! The Monty Python Flying Circus television show, which was broadcast via PBS here (1969-74), must have kept them exhausted, and 'Grail' came at the end of this era. Certainly, the production values are better in 'Brian', and the Python gang was motivated enough to come BACK together to make it which could only mean they were older, wiser, and perhaps more focused than before. I refuse to choose. I own them both, and I laugh with amazement at the both of them each and every time. However, 'The Life of Brian' is SO dead-on accurate, and SO equality minded when pointing out the foolishness of religions, bureaucracy, politics, social norms, political correctness, activists, and society in general, it leaves no one unscathed, unbattered, or able to restrain themselves from gut busting laughter while admiring the insights of these men.",Null,1,5,6 November 2007
Au Revoir les Enfants," There is a moment when we each lose our childhood
","'Au Revoir les Enfants' (French, 1987): Some say this is Louis Malle's masterpiece. Fair enough. Although set in the last years of WWII, at a Catholic boys school in France, this is not a 'last gasp fight to the death against the Germans' action film with gun toting youngsters. It is a story about BOYS, and it simply happens to be 1944. They're children of rich parents  boys who've been shuffled out of Paris (etc.) to the safer countryside. They're silly, awkward, conniving, antsy, and typical. Yes, they can sometimes hear fighting in the distance (but they're too busy with their own tiny squabbles), they are required to respond to air raids (but consider it a game), and they do see Nazis on occasionbut mainly, they're just typical, dopey boys. Slowly - very slowly - one of the brighter boys suspects that not is all what it seems, there at his school, and, with time on his hands, begins searching for secrets and answers. What he finds will change his life and lives of many others. Few films have looked at real war through the eyes of children, and this is possibly the best.",Null,1,2,17 July 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," And a Ho Ho Ho Hum.
","'Pirates of the Caribbean' (2002): Once in awhile I ignore my gut instinct, and see a film I KNOW deep down is junk - just to prove I was right, I guess - and I did it again, here. There's something about how the 'buzz' of a film travels. Water cooler time-kill. Three beers chit-chat. Stumble into one another quickie-advice. THOSE films are usually ones I do NOT like. T.V. ads have a vibe to them also, even when the stars are those who've done great work before. If it's a 'crowd pleaser' - which 'Pirates...' was - I should always go with the odds, and avoid it. This thing was hardly fun, hardly witty, hardly anything. It dragged and dragged...and dragged...dragged along under it's own tedious weight. Depp is a slightly gay pirate who knows lots of others with bad teeth. There are two soldiers who take the brunt of silly jokes (the Laurel & Hardy quotient). Special effects and action are required to cover a lack of story while entertaining the small mind, and required 'twists' are there to 'surprise' same...all this and more added up to nothing satisfying. It's a Disney (NON-Pixar) product, and couldn't be more evident in 'McPirates of the Caribbean'.",Null,0,1,29 June 2005
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," I've been spoiled.
","'The Chronicles of Narnia  The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe': I've been spoiled. I've seen 'Lord of the Rings', and you, Narnia, aren't a Lord of the Rings. However, I WILL say it's WAY better than those flat 'Harry Potter' things, and has a made-for-kids fantasy akin to the for-adults grandeur of 'Excalibur'. The special effects are pretty darned good here, and the story is well, VERY reflective of a number of things: 1) World War II in Europe, 2) the biblical story of Jesus, and, yes, 3) Lord of the Rings. C. S. Lewis, who wrote this story, went to school with J. R. Tolkien, who wrote 'Rings'. In fact, they shared ideas, and it shows. Good guys, bad guys (and gals  played by Tilda Swinton), twisted biological creatures who serve as the Righteous or Evil masses, sweeping landscapes, and in THIS case, a huge battle scene without one drop of blood (again, this one IS for kids). My wife and I enjoyed this one very much, and you will too, as long as you allow for it to be less than a fully adult story. Older kids would ADORE this. It gives kids all the power and glory they dream of having.",Null,0,1,27 March 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Brokeback was as good as Ice
","'Brokeback Mountain' (2005): There was never any doubt that I would like the photography, sound, scoring, and, most probably, the acting and casting. After all, this is the same man who made 'The Ice Storm'  a great film. Then again, I was nervous that this could somehow be another 'Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragon' somehow and boy did I dislike that one of his. 'Brokeback' is as good as 'Ice' in all the ways I expected. What had me concerned was the story. I kept asking myself if this was ENOUGH of a story anymore after all, the minority-on-the-outside/in-the-closet is a well-trodden subject. Was it getting all its attention merely due to the 'cowboy' context, and would this film be of ANY interest if set in Miami, San Francisco, or New York City, and the men were urbanites? What Ang Lee did was walk a very fine line, and present the specifics more as environment than subject. This was more about love, obsession, truth, responsibilities, honor, and honesty the Big Stuff. Although a few, tiny errors were seen in the film, I've already forgotten what they were, and I'm left with the feeling I've seen a very high level of film making. Having finally seen it, I can say I will see it again.",Null,12,14,28 March 2007
The Prestige," Finely structured complexity
","Starring Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Andy Serkis, Piper Perabo, and David Bowie (as Nikola Tesla). Well you thought 'The Sixth Sense' had twists and turns? Not compared to this one! It's the late 1800's. The next generation of stage magicians is coming  and they are VERY competitive. Two are near the top, and keep trying to out-do the other for top position. Then things get out of control. This is SO much fun, and the complexity is so finely structured, you finally just sit back and let yourself go for the ride. Think roller coaster that keeps shooting past the starting gate for another loop. 'The Prestige' has a sub-story, and that is of the inventor Nikola Tesla, whose biography I recently read. You will enjoy knowing that ALL the inventions and events depicted for Tesla were TRUE  until you get to the final secret related to the top hats. That's all I'll say. This was an exhilarating cat-n-mouse-n-mouse-n-cat-n-mouse story.",Null,2,4,13 November 2007
Crash," An Epic Poem about Racism and Redemption
","'Crash (2005): (Viewed two nights in a row): First night: With a sophisticated, complex, woven plot (which reminded me most of Grand Canyon), strong scoring, good photography, solid acting (including those Id come to expect little from, like Sandra Bullock), and a thread of gritty truth that runs through this hive of experiences, I was fascinated by it from start to finish. Using racism as a theme, it explores all the variations of who, when, where, and why, but with zero pandering to the audience, a sly use of stereotypes, and truth-seeking avoidance of PC-ness. On occasion, situations may seem a little too poetic for their own good, but this is a minor point, and in fact, I'm willing to call this film an EPIC Poem about Racism and Redemption (This is how I see 1998's 'The Thin Red Line' - an epic Poem to War. Second night: So now I've seen it twice. This time was equally good, with the opportunity to focus on a few specific aspects (of the many here). There are many stories in Crash that could each be an entire novel, or at least a major short story. In this day of sampling every thing - the aesthetic of using smaller pieces for a reassembled larger result seems to fit - taking strong aspects of each story, weaving them into a new rhythm, tying them together with a consistent tone, and constructing a highly complex yet focused new work. This is not a unique structure, but is a further exploration of what I easily look back to Grand Canyon as a solid source of inspiration.'",Null,0,4,10 March 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," NOT a Kid's Movie!
","'Pan's Labyrinth' (Spanish, 2006): It won 3 Academy awards. Sometimes that means something. I think it does this time, but I suspect the film leaves quite a few average audience members scratching their heads and feeling disappointed. The story has two strings  one historical, about the end of WWII in Spain, when those in power are trying to clear out the last of the rebels, and, one increasingly fantastic, about a young girl who stumbles into a world of mystery, threats, and very strange events. Watch the movie from this vantage point right from the outset: It will move back and forth from one set of 'realities' to the other. Think of one as the ADULT stage for The Struggle, and the other as the CHILD stage for The Struggle. It's political and archetypal. As for the creations, they are pretty interesting, with some wonderfully bizarre, dark, and frightening. THIS IS NOT a children's movie. NO WAY. It's violent and full of visualized nightmares.",Null,1,3,11 May 2008
Closer," Hang in there, I told myself
","'Closer' (2004): Jude Law, Natalie Portman, Juia Roberts, and, I'm sorry, I've forgotten the name of the other male lead, with Mike Nichols directing. As the film got rolling, I felt I was seeing too many plot and character clichés. 'Why am I being shown all this?' I asked myself. 'Hang in there,' I told myself, 'it'll clarify itself.' By god, it did. We are presented with four strangers who meet under completely random circumstances, and begin pursuing artificial relationships...but like a Rubic's Cube, every time they seem to have 'sided'  gotten CLOSER  they each, in their own pathetic, well-crafted fashion, set about to ruin it. Do I see a progression towards honest self-awareness? Hmm...I think so. 'Hang in there,' I told myself. Then they twist the Cube again. 'Maybe THIS is it this time,' I ponder. While watching 'Closer', I went from ambivalence to thinking it was quite good.",Null,0,0,30 January 2006
Capote," We watched it twice this year
","'Capote' (2005): Sometimes you can sense the quality of a film within the first minute. This one had it, and never let it go. From scoring to photography, palette to sets, and dialog to acting - everyone and everything came together. Hoffman NAILED Capote. Having never seen Harper Lee, I don't know if Keener succeeded, but I like what she presented. This one's all about Capote, anyhow. Phillip Seymor Hoffman has created lots of great roles, but this is the one that brought him to a larger audience. The story is not about the murders he studied. The story is about Capote  the egocentric, manipulative, self-deluding character who uses others and lies as long as he needs. It's a very dark story in the first place, and to then focus on someone who can only be considered a vulture who knows how to write, makes it all the more uncomfortable. You end up feeling grateful you weren't acquainted with the killers OR Capote. Top notch character study. We saw it twice this year.",Null,0,0,27 March 2007
The Grapes of Wrath," Squinting into a sun blotted out by dust
","'The Grapes of Wrath' (1940): Author John Steinbeck approved this film version of his book, despite changes that needed to be made for censors, etc.. Set AND made in the Depression of the late 1930's, starting in Oklahoma, we follow a destitute and harassed family as they attempt to reach 'the land of milk and honey' (California) for jobs. Their journey is the stuff of well, humans and their stories. The photography and lighting is some of the finest of all time. The story, unabashedly pro-Common Man - self-governing, self-policing, self-motivating  Unionizing  Socializing, if you will - is pure Great Depression. The hero isn't a god  God is within each of us  we are simply in a position to choose heroism. This is a large, sweeping, gritty, shadowy, rough film with tight lips and squinted eyes, bearing the pain and continuing on, stopping to mourn but not to abandon. It has its speeches, and they are glorious. The horizons are wide, though the moment is short. It is full of symbolism and yet remains personal. Only the most hardened or inexperienced or uneducated would see this film as somehow less than what comes from Hollywood now. And, for the first time, I am suggesting you see the DVD version with the running commentary by two experts, one on John Ford, one on John Steinbeck. THIS is worthwhile.",Null,0,1,11 May 2008
The Aviator," Obsessive/Compulsive Disorder has it's positive side.
","'The Aviator' (2004): I don't know a lot about Howard Hughes, and I truly hope that this film played it straight with historybecause it is a fascinating story, and I'd rather it be accurate. (Oliver Stone DIDN'T make it, Martin Scorcese did, so there IS a better chance it honors the truth!) We've ALL heard about Hughes' final, reclusive, CRAZY years, but 'The Aviator' covers the majority of his years before he lost himself to what I'm sure would now be labeled 'Obsessive/Compulsive Disorder'. The story immediately takes a peek at his childhood, where an important issue is clarified, and we then dive right into his start with aviation. We see his mind working 1,000 miles per hour, flying in 4 directions at a time, and NEVER shooting down ideas. He gambles everything, often, and fights for what he gets. He's no namby-pamby rich boy. You have to admire him, even if you DON'T want to be in his hire. Leonardo DiCaprio does a fine job, as does Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, Alan Alda, Ian Holm, Gwen Stefani, and Alec Baldwin. The dirty business of politics & payoffs is covered, but so is the glorious, imaginative efforts of Hughes and his engineers. Special effects are excellent, photography is exciting, dialog always interesting, sets & costumes rich with era, scoring greatit's all-around solid character study, and recreation of an era that is worth another look. If you liked the film 'Tucker', I can assure you 'The Aviator' will do nothing but top it, which is quite a compliment.",Null,0,0,8 November 2005
The Killing Fields," Astounding devastation

This is the true story of Cambodia's collapse during and after America's war in Viet Nam, when the Khmer Rouge began the Holocaust against their own citizens. Centered on real life characters, we join a writer and photographer from the New York Times, lead by their Cambodian interpreter/life saver. The story is amazing, frightening, very graphic, sad, disgusting, and joyous. We see the Best and the Worst of human behavior. The scoring is overdone (Mike Oldfield of 'Tubular Bells' fame), and too abstract & detached from the grittiness of the scenes). The photography has a solid documentary feel, and the constructed scenes of devastation absolutely astounding. There are scenes you will never forget.",Null,1,2,11 April 2006
American Psycho," Disturbingly funny
","Think of this as a very witty, dark, psychotic look at the 1980's in New York City. We follow a group of young money makers, especially one individual (a very talented Christian Bale), through the daily, income creating, label wearing, name dropping, reservation making life of empty objects, hollow relationships, and rich mental lives. The story has some twists to it, so I want to be careful here, but prepare yourselves for a film that makes you want to laugh and vomit at nearly the same moment. You will definitely appreciate Bale's acting, along with a nicely subdued Chloe Sevigny, a typical fritzy Reese Witherspoon, and a dogged detective played Willem Defoe. This is a VERY black comedy thriller, with lots of sex and violence, and cultural visions focused on our brand of consumerism. It's not a pretty sight, but it IS disturbingly funny.",Null,0,1,4 September 2007
American Beauty," Supremely alienated dialog
","'American Beauty' (1999): Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Allison Janney, Peter Gallagher, Mena Suvari, Wes Bentley, Chris CooperÂ…an all-talented cast, great photography & lighting, interesting score, and supremely alienated dialog (along the line of 'The Ice Storm'). 'American Beauty' received the Academy Award for Best Film of 1999, about which I have no argument. Spacey does a great job of creating an average man who's slowly losing his tolerance for a life that gives nothing back (and received Best Actor for it), Benning is a self-tortured Type A real estate broker who can't find perfection in the world, their daughter (Birch) - wanders solo through the house, trying to connect with something and someone. Her best - only - girl friend (Suvari), is a loud-mouthed, acidic Prom Queen type, who talks the talk and appears to walk the walk. A young man moves in next door. He's silent, and seemingly videotapes everything and everyone (Cooper). It is often through his lens that we observe these lives. This is by no means a comedy, but there is a lot of BLACK humor for awhile, which slowly sheds the humor part... leaving the film to conclude in the only ways it could. This is one of my favorite American films of the last decade. 'We' have done a great job of looking closely at our own culture, and finding some of what makes us 'US'. I would include 'Blue Velvet' 'The Ice Storm', 'Exotica', 'The Straight Story', and 'The Sweet Hereafter' in this genre.",Null,0,1,26 December 2005

In the recent spirit of films such as 'Memento', 'Pi', 'Clean, Shaven', and 'Fight Club', we have another truly interesting psychological drama asking us to decipher reality right along with the lead character (Bale). In order to look the role, Bale lost A LOT of weight  until he looked tortured and ready to die. It worked. He is a machinist at a metal working factory. He claims to have not slept  AT ALL  in a year. It's not a healthy state for him. Incidents keep stacking up on him, and he sees a pattern to them maybe and on he goes, trying to lead a normal life, trying to protect himself from perceived threats, trying to find the answers to the puzzles.

Tigerland," Training for Viet Nam
","Colin Farrell stars in a film by Joel Schumacher. This is a large, talented cast composed mainly of men because it's a story about Infantry training specifically for Viet Nam, in an isolated U.S. location called 'Tigerland'. It reminds me of the first half of Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket', which is also set in a training environment, and filled with stress. The story is driven by the interactions of the men, and their willingness or unwillingness to 'go with the program'. Most interesting is the complexity of the lead character 'Bozz' (played by Farrell) who looks for trouble, causes lots of friction, brings excessive problems upon himself, yet manages to get many of the men behind him in a time when that war was no longer a 'gung ho' effort. The look of the film is 'period documentary'  as though it was shot on 8mm film, stored in cans, and has discolored in various ways over the years. It also added 'other worldliness' to the imagery.",Null,0,1,23 November 2007

Well, 'Remember the Titans' is nothing new for HIM, or ANY of us. It's a Disney product: wall-to-wall cliché, full of holes, & pumped up on emotion, despite it's being a true story that could have been played straighter. No doubt, if you have nothing else to do with your life, you can take one of the big D's animated features, and find fish or 4-legged creatures that draw straight lines to the characters in '...Titans'.

","'CARS' (2006): I'm just going to repeat myself: Pixar CANNOT be beaten in the visual animation & cartoon story market. The visuals are SUPERB. Detailing, light/shadow, texture, perspective, wit, and characters with soul, make their (predictable theme) stories pure pleasure. Within the stories are the family/societal lessons we expect from Disney (whenever they've been at their best), and, they (the Corporation) SEEM to have the SENSE to leave the Pixar people alone. Pixar approaches a project as MORE than just 'another cartoon', and the results are there to see and feel. Not since the Fleischer brothers of the 20's, 30's, and 40's, has anyone been more innovative and thorough. Pixar kicks everyone's butts - including the good looking but generally empty products of their main competitor. To make the comparison, rent 'A Bug's Life' and 'Antz'. Watch them both on one night.

It focuses on only a few characters, and takes its own slow, painful time to make transitions in thinking or feeling. It's a fantastically smart film, and well done at EVERY level. In terms of clear-minded formalism, it reminds me of 'One Hour Photo'.

Schindler's List," I often want to vomit, cry, or scream
","'Schindler's List' (1993): I see this Monument repeatedly. It's brilliant and powerful, from start to finish. YOU should see it first, in it's entirety, if you're contemplating your children being exposed. Spielberg made his own 'parental warning' introduction, when it aired  unedited - on t.v. (a gutsy and triumphant moment for television). I would WANT my children to see it, as long as we had some preparation first, and PLENTY of discussion time after wards. Of course, this is an emotional and horrific story, scene after scene, full of dark insights at every turn, but it is the spiritual growth of Oskar Schindler  NOT an admirable man when we first meet him  that becomes one of the inspiring forces. Liam Neesom was great in this role, which helped make 'Schindler's List' one of my Top Five for supreme Character Studies. You will also see a typically subdued Ben Kingsley, and a brilliant, frighteningly evil-yet-torn, Ralph Fiennes. The music is not overwhelming, but present and effective. The camera work and lighting for this black & white work of Art are flawless. The use of a few tiny moments of color (aside from the start and finish), aren't really necessary, and a little overly poetic, but aren't bothersome. During the film, I often want to vomit, or cry, or scream. I'm glad I feel these things. Steven Spielberg never has to prove anything to anyone ever again...even if he makes another 'E.T.' or 'War of the Worlds'.",Null,9,13,24 January 2006
The Elephant Man," Fear is not always in your head
","After David Lynch's first masterpiece, 'Eraserhead' (late 1970's), came this true story about an Englishman in the 1800's, John Merrick, afflicted with many diseases and the utmost in difficult lives. If you're familiar with 'Eraserhead', you'll find Lynch brought many of his effective tools to this next project  real black and white film, strong lighting, dream sequences, an almost unbelievably rich sound track, actors perfect for the roles, and his dark vision of Life. John Hurt, Anne Bancroft, John Gielgud, Anthony Hopkins are among the talented actors. Taking no unnecessary liberties with the Truth, we experience some of the most intense disgust and admiration for Humanity we will ever encounter. John Merrick's life was a roller coaster of Hell and Heaven, abuse and kindness, violence and gentility. You are pulled in immediately, though you try to hold back out of fear of the unknown. Even then, knowing is not enough to remove the fear. Fear is NOT always 'just in your head'. No one makes films like Lynch. Few films move me as 'Elephant Man'. There are only a handful of films holding so much emotional intensity that we can each translate into our own lives. This is one.",Null,0,0,4 September 2007
The Illusionist," You'll enjoy slapping yourself
","'The Illusionist' (2006): With good acting, stylish photography harking back to another era, a film score that's moody and effective (by Philip Glass doing what he DOES do well), and a plot that only gets more and more interesting as it goes along. This is one good piece of entertainment. Is it a 'morality' tale? Barely. It's a romance and a crime mystery. It has political intrigue, good and bad guys, and plenty of tricks up its sleeves. You will NOT see the complexity as it builds, partly due to its not being available, but partly because it's slipped to you just a little at a time, and not in ways that calls attention to itself. Fortunately, the web of deceit is reviewed by a former foe at the end, and you'll enjoy slapping your forehead right along with him.",Null,1,1,28 March 2007

","'Pi' (1997): This is a frantic exploration into the obsessive/compulsive, schizophrenic mind of a math fanatic (genius?). His attempts to find a pattern in the number 'pi' lead him to places he does not understand, and many other people seem to want. What he holds in his head is of great fascination and torment to him, and the object of desire for people who seem to be following him. Gorgeous, expressive b/w photography, rich sound, moody music tracks, and a mysterious, paranoid script make this one fascinating film.

","This is the true story of Edward R. Murrow's television commentator/news man career in the early 1950's, and his battle with the fear mongering, political bully Eugene McCarthy. Restrained acting, subtle period sets, low key costuming, the use of actual footage when possible, and the most beautiful, velvety blacks, grays, and whites of any film ever, made this an extremely high quality film experience.

Kill Bill: Vol. 1," My Dinner with The Squad
","'Kill Bill, Volumes 1 & 2': Quentin Tarantino has now sucked all the milk from his earlier teat career. 'Wunderkind QT' is no longer inventing. He's caricaturizing everything he and other film makers did. He has learned nothing positive or negative from Warhol or Devo. 'Kill Bill 1 & 2' could easily be one film of standard length. It wouldn't make it a better film, but it would reduce the dragging, dull scenes of repetitive slashing (yes, I said dull - there only so many limbs that can be removed in so many ways), and endless pseudo-story-laden philosophizing - 'My Dinner with The Squad'. I was obviously disappointed. There WERE occasional witty moments, some fun choreographing, pretty animation, and I often liked the atmosphere created by cover songs used in scenes...but even they were overused. Tarantino overuses everything, including himself. The centuries old and still valid challenge to all artists is to know when to STOP on a work...and it IS before you run out of breath.

World Trade Center," Oliver Stone and the Truth
","I appreciate Oliver Stone movies when they're fiction, but HATE what he does to facts/history. I had a chance to buy this film at a very low price, and since 9-11-01 remains of interest and concern to me, I held my breath and went ahead with it. The other factor that pushed me towards it was Maggie Gyllenhaal. She's been great in everything I've ever seen. I've come to trust her. Nicolas Cage has a spotty record with me, but I'm still willing to check him out  despite my fear he'll over-act. Well, Maggie was great, Nicolas did NOT over-act, and Ollie did NOT disregard the facts or the emotional truth. (My pessimism says it was because this episode in our history is too fresh, clear, and important to us to let him risk getting away with the usual fact-bending and lying. Whatever the case, EVERYONE did a great job. It was a tense, very emotional, intimately accurate look at those first couple of days, and the limbo in which a few 'lucky' people found themselves. Michael Pina and Maria Bello were no less impressive. The score was ominous, sad, meditative, and never intrusive. I was very moved by this film  not in the same way as the documentary footage, of course, but by its tight, claustrophobic storytelling of one tiny set of moments for just a few of the thousands  millions  of people affected then, and who remain affected.",Null,0,1,6 November 2007
Big Fish," If you liked 'Edward Scissorhands...'
","'Big Fish' (2003): You MIGHT have to already have some experience with Tim Burton's films - at least some of them - or you'll MIGHT end up feeling baffled and unfulfilled by this one. I'm not sure. When Burton is at his best, his films are like no one else's. In my opinion, if you like his film 'Edward Scissorhands,' you'll like 'Big Fish' - for it is it's closest relative. The idea of 'Big Fish' takes on a number of meanings throughout the story, and although it feels a little heavy handed at times (perhaps as it relates to the character of the Father), it's very entertaining, has some strong emotions, lots of unique laughs, people, sets, and circumstances, and ends up making it's point - with enough room left for your personal vision to join in. God Bless the story tellers in our lives. What would we be without them?

Annie Hall," When Woody Allen became great.
","'Annie Hall' (1977): Simply one of the most innovative, interesting, insightful films you will ever experience - again and again. THIS work announced that Woody Allen would never again return to slapstick comedy, and would instead draw from deeply personal sources in the manner of other serious artists. It's innovative for his use of still camera shots that allow it's characters to leave (or never enter) a scene (yet you hear their conversation), subtitling of thoughts vs words, movies within movies, the use of animation within a 'normal' film, giving the dialog to other actors on a stage, characters who leave their bodies and still carry on conversations, characters who break from the film and talk to us the audience, split screen depictions of different times or places with the characters speaking to one another across the splits, flash backs of characters that describe their futures...it's a superb break from what was expected. It's interesting on more than artistic levels, as Allen delves into references far beyond the mundane, and presents them with wit, humor, and awkward honesty. It's insightful for his honest and thoughtful look at how humans behave under different realities. 'Annie Hall' is a masterpiece. (And watch for many lucky young actors (such as Jeff Goldblume, Christopher Walken, Shelley Duval, etc.) who, thirty years ago, could only dream that 'Annie Hall' would help kick start their hopeful careers.",10,1,2,6 June 2005
2001: A Space Odyssey," Great expression of its era
","'2001: A Space Odyssey' (again, 1968): Any reproduction of this film seen on a FLAT, small (non-theater) screen, and chopped to fit contemporary formats will NEVER give you an idea of the visual and aural effects received by a 1968 audience. They sat in rare and expensive theaters exclusively built for the phenomenal techniques of Cinemascope and Super Panavision. What this meant was a sitting in luxurious seating surrounded by a 180 degree screen that required three projectors running and blending 3 sections of the film into a seamless movie that literally wrapped around your head/field of vision, with sound to match. Add to that the exceptional length of '2001' (139 minutes, which was almost unheard of in 1968), special effects that truly changed the world of film making; the epic subject ('Man' from ape-beginnings to Celestial Being); the fact the audience was indeed anticipating our FIRST escape from Earth to ANOTHER PLANET (only a year away!); and presenting a metaphysical film to a typical American audience  and it being SUCCESSFUL!  and you have an idea how difficult this film is to watch without its context. None the less it's great sci-fi, a great expression of its era, has technological and script breakthroughs galore, asks MUCH of its audience  from patience to brain power, and gives you so many scenes you will NEVER forget, that to not see this film is to not see a clear picture of film history.

Instead, you are shown relentless, graphic violence, and non-stop greed, torture, black marketeering, the kidnap slave trade, and everyone having an agenda. It's a beautifully photographed film, with subtle yet powerful scoring, and great acting by the leads, including, but not limited to, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Connelly. You GET the points being made early on. What carries you through this film is the story of the characters  THEIR journeys  THEIR changes  and the fact you care about them more and more.

To whom shall we give credit? Quentin Tarantino and his 'Pulp Fiction'? Well, like any FASHION trend, it can used as an empty, stylish method to hide a lack of substance, or, LIKE 'Eternal Sunshine...' it can be used to support the topsy turvy story it sets out to tell. We learn that a man (Jim Carey) has been rejected by a woman (Kate Winslet), and he's pretty torn up about it. We then learn he wants to get her back. Standard fare. THEN things change. You'd better be of clear head when you watch this one, because it's going to challenge you with it's depictions of alternate realities, internal visualizations, and moments that for some time will feel helter skelter. Only with work will you keep up. Honest...hmm..m....unless I'm just a Dumb or Dumber Guy. Here are some of the pleasant surprises (and I'm giving away NOTHING by listing these, so you can open your eyes again now): Jim Carey can now be considered a good actor along with a great comedian.

I love films, and this was his first recommendation. The IDEA is an interesting one: layers of psychological challenges that are slowly revealed to the very last moment. We are 'set up' more than once, and I fell right into it. I admit it - they got me - but I was disappointed in the answer, which struck me as nothing more than a vehicle for driving sequels down Money Highway. The acting was uneven, and sometimes bad.

"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," One of the roughest films you'll ever see.
","'Salo: The 120 Days of Sodom' (1975): Be prepared for one of the roughest films you'll ever see. This was Pasolini's last, and going by what I've seen, his vision only became bleaker and more disturbed as the years clawed along. Using the Marquis de Sade's ideas on the decadence of 18th century France, Pasolini represents Fascist Italy (1944-45). We are shown the upper class  always removed and protected from the outer world  as predators of the poor, weak, young, and less educated. A group of wealthy adults shop amongst the kidnapped older children of bourgeoisie. They choose eighteen, and steal them away to a hidden mansion, where there is no escape. There, the adults live out every twisted fantasy they've ever had or can now muster, while demeaning, raping, and torturing the youngsters. The teens react in many ways, none of which are 'pretty'. This entire film experience MUST be viewed as a symbolic, emotional 'explanation' of what it was like to live under Nazi/Fascist rule (in this case), and how an otherwise normal, decent society could be turned into lunatics and sub-animals. Although made 30 years ago (with the usual weaker production qualities of that era), I cannot think of another work which so blatantly and painfully illustrates what those in power are capable of doing when boredom gives rein to impulse. In comparison, 'Lord of the Flies' barely lights upon these issues, 'Pink Flamingos' was but a tiny, kitschy springboard, and 'Schindler's List' described a much narrower range of degradation. To this day, 'Salo: ' is banned in some countries. This is NOT a film about acting, lighting, sound, camera work, etc.. This is a film about states of mind  theirs then, ours now. P.S.: If you are interested in set design, this one is FILLED with original Cubist/Bauhaus/Futurist/Moderne furnishings, murals, and art. Spectacular. Those styles were not yet being reproduced, so Pasolini used the real thing. There is also an interesting use of a Charles Rennie MacIntosh chairwhich will alter how you see this design from here on out.",8,210,261,6 June 2005

Worthy of your time...they are wonderfully complex psychological dramas, I will see them over and over. Aside from the obvious use of colors within each film, and some of the symbolism (which I suspect the European art crowd finds nicely elitist in that secret-society way, no one will absorb the full depth of these characters after one viewing. I also suspect that the issues portrayed in 'Blue' are related to European politics and issues of solidarity, represented by various characters and circumstances.

It is not a pretty sight, and there are no winners or heroes to be found, but it rings of Truth - lives that circle and circle around shared and private histories, that never get clarified, that never utter what needs to be spoken. The meanings and characters of this story are larger than the little lives depicted. This is the stuff of epics.

It's a Wonderful Life," Quality does not become a ClichÃ©

Jimmy Stewart was at his best. Donna Reed? What a girl-next-door-babe! Clarence the Angel? Perfectly innocent and effective. Bert & Ernie? I suppose they are a major realization for Sesame Street fans!! The children - fragile and pure. Sam Wainwright - the goofy, life-time friend, no matter how rich he became. Evil Mister Potter? The man we love to hate (hissss!), played by Lionel Barrymore (Drew's grandfather). The rejected kid at the dance, who opens the dance floor for George & Mary to fall in? Remember 'Alfalfa' in 'The Little Rascals'/'Our Gang'? That's him. You KNOW what 'Potter's Field' is slang for, right? It's the generic name given to graveyards for people who died alone, broke, and unclaimed. Uncle Billy? His memory problem is easy for me to relate to, and I've always wished I had a CROW as a bird-pal. Violet? We ALL knew (or know) a Violet...the good hearted gal who relied too heavily on appearances. One of the prettiest photographic scenes is early in the film, when George and Mary are just leaving town in the taxi after their wedding - it's raining, and they stop to look back at what appears to be a 'run' on the Savings and Loan. As they peer out the back window of the taxi, THAT is pure beauty. Do I still get misty with a film that I've easily seen 50 times? Yes. When Mr. Gower realizes that young George caught his prescription mistake. When adult George comes home that night shattered, and SNAPS. This film's heart is in the RIGHT place SO often for SO many reasons. I've always shaken my head in amazement at people who saw it as schmaltzy. Yes, it has those moments, but they're at a minimum (and are needed as RELIEF!) compared to the overwhelming amount of loss, frustration, fragility, anger, near & true violence, nasty characters, and shocking realizations. I see it as a TRUE spiritual journey along a suddenly frightening road. It STILL nearly brings me to tears at points, along with amazement at the story, and how it was done.

WHO is imagining WHAT? WHY is she suspecting THAT? Is Rosemary nuts? If not, are THEY in on it? John Cassevettes plays her patient husband, the crazy Ruth Gordon who won the Oscar for her role, as one of their neighbors, many character actors you'll recognize...and they all add up to an increasingly tense, psychological-horror film that shook up EVERYONE in 1968.

Heavy doses of special effects (and yes, some are very good), with relentless action, pounding scores, running and screaming, hiding and gasping...it's all there...in a slick, soulless package.

She outshines Tom Cruise, Tim Robbins (he slept-walk through this, his now-patented role of oddball creep), and the others. So, to sum up (not deserving much discussion), it's an exciting potpourri of FX & plot clichés, gives you an excuse to lay around on the sofa, and satisfies like Chinese take-out.

Except for an occasional bit of over-acting (a leftover from silent film and stage training - which is very forgivable, considering), this work is an amazing experience - NOT at a hokey, dated, poorly visualized 77 year old period oddity. For an audience in 1930, it would have been especially horrific, disgusting, and full of painful truths.

The Last King of Scotland," Memorable violence - not for children
","Starring Forrest Whittaker. Whittaker looks more like the real Idi Amin than Idi Amin ever did. Amin took over Uganda in a military coup against what was considered Britain's puppet government in the early 1970's. With that done, he became the President, and, oddly enough, gained a fetish for all things Scottish, since they too sent the English packing. We watch this semi-true story unfold through the eyes of a fictional character, first impressed and dazzled by Amin and his ensuing power, later suspicious and horrified by what might be the truth of his rule. This is NOT a film for children, and although the violence is not often shown (by contemporary standards), WHEN it's shown, it's memorable. Whittaker does a great job as the manic/depressive, power crazy, paranoid killer, Idi Amin. The fictional character (of a young doctor) gives an unbroken thread to this story, which allows for the tension to be established and move along.

American Gangster," Everyone was on vacation here
","Just a quick note: I was loaned my first (and last) pirated copy of a film  THIS film. Why would ANYONE who loves films a) want to ever again see a poorly digitized, poorly formatted version of an Art form they claim to love and respect, and b) want to rip off the people who create what you claim you want to see? Okay, with THAT said, Russell Crowe, Denzel Washington, Ruby Lee, and Armand Assante lead this true 1970's story of police corruption and the escalation of drugs in New York. Think 'Serpico' mixed with 'The French Connection' mixed with 'Superfly'. Seriously. I was a little disappointed in Washington, who, more than anything, simply did his 'Denzel' routine in a different outfit. He smeared too much of his patented 'proud black man deserving respect' routine over what was, let's face it, a sleazy drug dealer and serial killer. (See 'Glory' or 'Malcolm X' if that's what you want, see 'Training Day' if you want to see him stretch beyond his habits.) He was poorly cast in 'American Gangster', and did not have the push to reach beyond what he can do in his sleep. As I think about it, Crowe - and just about everyone - was cast and then given a pass to do what they've done before and before and seemed satisfied with that. The story, even with it having a basis of fact to it, was not unique within the genre. Yes, it was good suspense drama, with strong dosages of violence, nudity, drug use, etc., and for some, on some evening, this will be enough. One viewing is enough for me.

Unfortunately, as it pulls together, it loses much of its wit and edge. It becomes less interesting, frankly. Will Ferrell does a fine job of being subdued yet comedic, Maggie Gyllenhaal is not tested in her role, Emma Thompson does a wonderful job as a neurotic author with writer's block, Dustin Hoffman straight-faces his way through as though he were a responsive version of 'Rain Man', and Tom Hulce and other stars round out the cast. The decors are a little too consistently hip to be seen as individualistic (the set designer paid less attention to the characters than to his/her own interests), and the scoring seems pasted on. Once I caught on to the story's movement, I reasonably guessed the ending, due to the romantic angle. It's an okay film. It's not great, it's not awful.

This is a dense, draining, monumental Epic of a story about love, hate, honor, violence, context, and forgiveness. GREAT War films are never about war they are about humans facing extraordinary circumstances, and having to deal with them one split second at a time.

This is a VERY focused film that does not veer off into studies of the other members of the royal family. If it looks at a second person with any depth, it's Tony Blair, who was new to the government. I found it interesting for the events of Diana's death, as seen through the eyes of Queen Elizabeth, to be compressed into 103 minutes, but I do not expect the 'newsworthiness' aspect of this film will have 'legs' into the future. One set of very interesting scenes revolve around a huge, elegant, 16-point stag on their 'country' property. Elizabeth has two encounters with him. You initially think she reveals her 'humanity' through him by responding to his beauty, but she sees herself AS him for other reasons and, the second encounter does not offer her the fantasized elegance of the first.

Every time I see this film, I like it more. Perhaps it's not as huge in scope as 'Lawrence of Arabia', but of equal quality when it comes to being a character study. It just doesn't get any better than this. The transformation of a girl into a woman into a reluctant, then resigned, then powerful queen, surrounded by liars, schemers and self-centered fools, is powerful history enough. Add the very best acting, sets, & costumes that feel REAL (not Movie-real), and a point that never veers away from it's goal, and I've got a film I'll see numerous times. Cate Blanchett is the best.' Now: 'Elizabeth  the Golden Age' is a great followup effort. All I've said about the latter applies to this one, and I add that the shift from the first 'dark' film to this, a film full of light, is an interesting visual symbol for the changes in England (not to mention the darkening of Spain). This part of the story is 'grander'  bigger  with huge events  less about the growth of Elizabeth, and more about England and its goals. It DOES get personal, but all is repeatedly set aside for the sake of what was seen as British destiny. This would make a wonderful double feature.",Null,0,0,11 May 2008
The Deer Hunter," No one is 'average'
","'The Deer Hunter' (1978): Although 'only' three hours in length, The Deer Hunter feels like thirty. This is a brilliant, high stress film that takes you through the daily lives of a group of adult friends in the urban decay of a dying, blue collar industrial revolution, as they kill time in massive, insignificant ways - only to be further decimated in the jungles of Viet Nam, and their own psyches afterwards. This is a very patient film. It's goal isn't to look at war, but to give insight into these few people, who are not unlike others we all knowpeople who are not special to anyone but one another, do their best with what they know, and try to deal with a highly complex world. All the acting is powerful, the camera work and music tracks barely excessive for my taste, but the script, detailing, roles, and story are awesome. Each character is given the depth and attention to become someone significant to you. This entire work is significant. It is a huge, complex look at, and inside, a few 'average' people. Everyone is average until we begin to understand themand then there's no such creature.",Null,0,0,26 December 2005
Kagemusha," A BIG, worthwhile film
","'Kagemusha' (1980): Directed by Akira Kurosawa. This is a SWEEPING Historical Epic about warlords of Japan in the 16th century. It has all the glamour and hugeness of a Hollywood production, but with goals of a more serious nature. A petty thief is found, just prior to execution, so identical in appearance to the Clan ruler, his life is 'spared' in the name of 'service' to them. Look-alikes were used as protection ('targets') and double-duty ('stand-ins') - as they have been ever since. Things go wrong, and many adjustments are suddenly necessary within the Clan, the family, and even the enemy camps. All the lessons are monumental, archetypal, Shakespearian, Greek. Perhaps occasionally long (at least for an American with little knowledge of ancient Japanese history), many of the scenes are powerful, beautiful, and horrific. I am NOT a fan of split-tinted filters for special sky effects, and at times the classic acting style of Japan is stylized beyond character credibility, but overall, this is a BIG film, and worth the 160 minute viewing.",Null,0,1,27 March 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Archetypes galore!
","'Lord of the Rings' (2001, 2002, 2003): Fun, exciting, full of action, romance, heart, and enough archetypes to represent the entire history of humans. I'm going to keep it simple here: The entire Trilogy is what is important, and only if you're willing to view it as serious stuff, not merely entertainment (although it's certainly that as well). I read the Tolkien books, and I thought no one could get close to depicting them visually. You know... like what I had in my head? I was WRONG. These three films are masterpieces of visual story telling. The MOST important thing however is this entire Epic was written in Archetypes - that is, the REAL issues are those ALL of humankind has ALWAYS seen as important: honesty, bravery, love, decency, truth, good vs evil, lust, honor... 'Lord of the Rings' has it all, as did the Greek tragedies, Shakespeare, lost stories told around campfires, and even a film that at first appears to be very time/site specific, like 'Mystic River'. This IS the stuff of all Ages. I feel lucky to have been born into a time when a true Epic was written. (My wife and I watched the Trilogy over three sequential evenings. Although demanding much time, this really helps keep the story together, compared to their original release times. Side notes: 'The Hobbit' was written in 1937, with the much larger 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy begun soon after WWII. Although Tolkien was obviously referencing ancient lore (mainly from northern Europe and Scandinavia), I have the strong suspicion it was equally driven by conditions of spreading violence and official war in the Pacific and Europe beginning in the early 30's, reaching unavoidable participation by the late 30's. I see no reason NOT to interpret Lord of the Rings as a symbolic, emotional version of our own World War II. (Why, even the water landing crafts used by Orcs in Part Three (of the film) were directly inspired from the American landing crafts used for our soldiers). The designers must have loved being involved in this project, but also felt lots of pressure to meet the visual expectations of generations of the Book Readers. Only one reference in the entire trilogy seemed out of place, and that was uttered by Gimli the Dwarf, when he mentioned 'tossing Dwarfs'. I did not need ANY contemporary, insider-joke references. I very much liked the logic of architectural, costume, character, and monster designs. Kudos to those artists. As far as I'M concerned, Liv Tyler can KEEP the pointy ears ON! She wore 'em well. And, if the Elven language (which she spoke perhaps the best of them all) was real, I would learn it just for her. Lovely sounds. Better than French. Many of the massive military Orc gathering scenes had the appearance of Hitler's Nuremburg spectacles. NATURALLY, the good monsters were huge Eagles. The bad monsters looked like Mammoths, sea creatures, snakes, Cockroaches, or the genetic spawn of Pork Rinds. The character designs I had a little trouble with were the Ancient Trees (Ents). They didn't have the gritty believability of the others.",Null,1,2,11 April 2006
Hart's War," This is a film about perceptions and honor
","'Hart's War' (2002): This is a film about perceptions and honor. It's written as a WWII/P.O.W. story, set in Germany, during the winter of 1944-45. You'll be struck first by the great photography and scoring, then by the memorable scenes taking place within them. Although headed by talented actors, most are wonderfully submerged in their characters. This is a complex work, with a plot that reveals itself cautiously, which is entirely necessary to make its' points. The truth must arrive slowly. Much of it takes place in P.O.W. huts, and a makeshift 'court room'. At some point during the film, you'll think 'Hogan's Heroes' - but lose that dumb thought. It has no place here. If anything, think 'Bridge on the River Kwai', with a 2005 sensibility. This is a serious and very admirable film at all levels, discussing humankind's most cherished, most defended beliefs.",Null,4,7,26 December 2005
Braveheart," And did I say VIOLENT?
","'Braveheart' (1995): Huge, powerful, violent, interesting, romantic, and, did I say VIOLENT? The story (and no doubt fertile myths) retells the life story of William Wallace, who, in the 13th century, lead his ragtag band of commoners into larger and larger battles against highly militarized England, eventually winning freedom for 'his' Scotland. With big scoring, majestic landscapes, Shakespearian situations, and hopefully, an effort to tell history with some credibility (I cannot assure you of this), Wallace's IS a life WORTH retelling into the centuries. Some people are Driven and Focused. THIS he became after experiencing for himself the cruel and unfair treatment of his people by the monarchy of England. It is an inspiring story full of blood, torture, fire, steel, mud, and courage. Acting is high quality across the board, photography is lush, and dialog worthy of Henry the VIII. Starring, produced and directed by Mel Gibson, with Sophie Marceau, Patrick McGoohan, Catherine McCormack, and many other talented people.",Null,0,1,30 January 2006
The Pursuit of Happyness," The Victim vs All The Bad People
","Starring Will Smith, his son, and Thandie Newton. Based on a true story I'm sure had many more grays than blacks and whites, with deeper personalities. Will Smith does a fine job, especially as he begins to collapse under the weight of his situation, but I was disappointed in the set up: Victim vs 'all the Bad People'. It is of course too simplistic. I'm sure this made the film more accessible to a general public, and it IS inspirational if you suspend disbelief, but Life just ain't like this, folks. One person DOESN'T take all the hits while others always walk away unbruised. The film ended as predictably as an old Western: the calvary arrives at the last second to save the brave-but-outnumbered pioneers. Newton's character is automatically given a nasty role, with no real explanation for her anger, and especially not her final behavior. Many of the people are mere convenient cutouts representing what Smith could not seem to reach. Do we sometimes feel like this? Yes. Is it when we're busy seeing ourselves as victims, even if we ARE trying? Yes. This was a very '80's' film. Decent person struggles, has setbacks, overcomes bad guys, and wins in the end. Toss in the class struggle, and there you have it: THIS. It's the second time I've watched it this year. The interactions between Smith and his son are often very moving and THAT is the heart of this story.",Null,0,0,23 November 2007
All the President's Men," The historically uninterested need not apply
","'All the President's Men' (1976): Focusing on the Watergate Scandal, and made soon after Nixon's resignation due to his & his staff's lying under oath, this film came out. It was an exciting, tense, boiled-down depiction of what had become a huge mass of confusing facts with which the public had wrestled. History aside, is this a good FILM? Yes. It's well acted and well made. It tells the story, and gives the broader meaning. Does is have enough intrinsic substance to interest someone who is uninterested in this episode of history? I doubt it, but then, I could care less about someone so ignorant and so lacking in curiosity. Dustin Hoffman, Robert Redford, Jack Warden, Hal Holbrook, Jason Robards star. See small, early roles by Meredith Baxter(-Birney), and many others.",Null,2,3,11 April 2006
Atonement," Clarification at last
","'Atonement' (2007): With hesitations: I need to see this one a second time. It may go up or down in my categories. There's no doubt the acting, lighting, and photography were great. The 1930's story has too much of what I've long been weary  Constipated English Gentry. There is a glossy, invisible division between the viewer and the characters, making them seem less real. The story jumps around and often morphs, which I didn't mind, but doubted its usefulness until the last 15 minutes, when it was finally clarified. It didn't take long to understand the idea of 'atonement', but I WAS caught by surprise as to how it was all happening. This was interesting to me, and finally removed the 'glossiness' with which I had trouble.",Null,1,1,11 May 2008
