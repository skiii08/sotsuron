The Blair Witch Project," Masterpiece, and very very scary
","Quite honestly, you, the viewer, can easily decide 'I WILL NOT BE SCARED' and sit through this movie without so much as a tremble. Its one of those flicks where you have to let yourself go a little, and (particularly) let your imagination run a little wild. This can be jarring for many, since we often get films were there is nothing left for your imagination whatsoever.If you buy into it, this film is very scary. Several images keep popping into my mind days after seeing it (the ending image especially). It is far scarier than any other film I have seen, and the lingering 'creepiness' I feel is kind of disturbing. I have never felt so odd for so long after seeing a film. I still can't figure out what was scarier - the 'haunting' by an unseen phantom, or watching the 3 characters in the film break down mentally out of sheer terror.A masterpiece.",Null,1,2,6 August 1999
