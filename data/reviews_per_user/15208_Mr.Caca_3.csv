Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Pure Entertainment, Pure Fun
","This movie is pure fun. It's not Shakespeare, and it won't change your life. It's STAR WARS.Must I address the Jar Jar issue? Okay then. I can see why people thought he was annoying, but I don't care. He was funny, and if you don't like him, quit shoving it in my face. I don't care if you don't like him. I think he's cool.People said the acting was wooden in the originals too. Who cares? You don't see Star Wars for the acting. I didn't hear anyone say 'Let's go see that new Sam Neill movie' when Jurassic Park came out. They went to see people getting eaten by dinosaurs! And people went ot this one to see Star Wars. Quit expecting some dark or serious or important movie. The first three had bigfoot running around with a guy that kissed his sister and two robots!
Many critics addressed the whole 'Trade Federation' issue. They said the old Star Wars was very patriotic, but this one is anti-government. HELLO? I think they were trying too hard to find something to critisize. That makes about as much sense as 'The Truman Show symbolizes the fetus' desire to laave the womb'.The vast majority of the public loved it. There's a small minority, mostly on the itnernet that love to bash it, and they get more press than they deserve. If you don't like it, quit cramming it down my throat. I loved it.",10,0,0,24 August 1999
The Truman Show," Intelligence! AT LAST!
","Everything in this movie was remarkably well done. Peter Weir's direction and feel for the movie made it absolutely awesome. He took what could have been a strange, goofy movie, and turned it into an almost religious experience. He also chose to not tell us what happens after Truman leaves the studio. A wise decision, as some would be tempted to show what happens next. But an intelligent artist knows you should always leave the auidence wanting more. And that is what he has done, yet it is still satisfying. Jim Carrey's performance is excellent. He's funny, but he plays Truman as a tortured soul, and because of the depth of his performance, you can't help but feel tremendous pity for Truman. You almost feel proud when he reaches the edge of his world. Philip Glass and Burkhard Dallwitx both worked on the score, and both composers worked perfectly. Instead of using one composer for the film, using one theme, Weir 'stole' certain bits because they fit his movie so perfectly. When Truman falls in love with a beautiful woman, and tries to talk to her, a piece by Chopin palys. A composer hired to write music for the movie wouldn't have been as good for that specific scene. Dallwitz's score was almost sparse, but it perfectly fit the mood of the story. It was manipulative. This whole movie is. You'll wonder if THEY want you to like the movie. There wasn't a single element that didn't work perfectly. this movie lacked violence, sex, foul language, and all the other filth that movies have today. That's what sets it apart from others, to me. Pleasantville is often compared to the Truman Show, but only because they both deal with TV as subject matter. In fact, these movies are radically different. The Truman Show is an innocent movie with a darker, more ominous undertone to it, that has a message to it. It's funny, touching, and thought provoking. Pleasantville is about teenagers who fornicate. It's full of smut, and at its core, there's nothing but filth and a shallow story that seriously strains credibility. If you enjoy intelligent movies, and hate it when people walk out of movies like Armageddon, saying 'that was AWESOME', then PLEASE see the Truman Show.",Null,0,0,26 November 1998
Contact," Art from Hollywood? Finally!
","This movie is art! I read Carl Sagan's book a couple years before the movie came out. The book is wonderful. There are a few differences, but overall they're both compatible with each other. Something that is unique about this film is that it splits the audience in half. 50% of the audience will hate it. Don't worry about them. These people didn't notice the suddle and artistic camera techniques. They came to this movie expecting to SEE aliens. So they were disappointed when they didn't see them with their eyes. The people that hate this movie generally like movies like 'Armageddon' and Quentin Tarantino movies. They don't like movies that make them think.The other hlaf will generally like it a lot. Some will absolutely love it. These people like to leave the theater with their head full of interesting possibilities. This movie does make you think. Some would call it anti-religious. I read one review of it in a 'christian' movie review magazine, which said it was damaging to a christian's faith. Why? Because it dares to examine science and religion together. This movie is about fact versus faith. This movie isn't anti-religious. The whole theme is: Faith is necessary because some of life's most important truths can't be proven. You could say that it's impossible to prove the existence of God. Personally, I don't think so. I think if you look at it logically, it's incredibly obvious that God exists.The music is great,the actors are all convincing and likable (except for a few, although their characters were written that way). Carl Sagan put a lot of thought and thoughtfulness into his creation, and it shines through in the movie version. He had a tremendous appreciation for the wonders of the Universe, and this movie embodies that. Whether you're devoutly religious or a hard skeptic, you'll walk out of the theater looking up and smiling. Personally, I don't think aliens exist, but it was still a good movie. THe people that hate this movie can have movies liek 'Armageddon' and 'Godzilla' for themselves. This is much better. You'll THINK!",10,0,2,5 February 1999
