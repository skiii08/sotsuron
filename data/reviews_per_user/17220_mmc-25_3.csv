Black Swan," My top for 2010.
","Not had a chance to see True Grit, probably after Jan 1... so here's my top films so farThe Fighter, The Kings Speech, Black Swan, Inception and not in that order, each has its reason for being #1 for me. Aronofsky's other films I've liked are The Wrestler and Requiem for a Dream. Black Swan reminded me more of Requiem for a Dream, it will mess with your mind, in a good way. Reminds me of reading PK Dick's Three Stigmata, he would lead you down a path only to find out it wasn't real then another build up and again you weren't sure what was real. Inception was similar in that respect except it didn't emotionally grab you like Black Swan... being grabbed and let go and grabbed again. Also like the wrestler those that had a relationship with the main character (Nina) were strange themselves. Aronofsky also worked his magic with Barbara Hershey, Kunis and Cassell... looking forward to his next film. Thank you to all who worked on this film.",8,1,4,31 December 2010
Horrible Bosses," Trumps other comedies this year
","So far the funniest movies I've seen this year in order are:1. Horrible Bosses, cast was great, my date didn't recognize Farrell until I mentioned him, what a hoot! Spacey was mean and nasty and great. Aniston, wow, wow, wow, could not take my eyes off this hot lady, and funny! 2. Bridesmaids, other than some potty humor that was funny but not my taste I enjoyed this very much. Well casted. 3. Bad Teacher, Diaz is great in this film, supporting cast do just that, and well done. 4. Hangover II. This seemed to be a walk-through for most of the cast. Bosses was 1000x better.",10,5,10,24 July 2011
Tropic Thunder," Cruise was great
","somewhat discombobulated script... but the characters made it worth watching... Black is great, so is Nolte, the SURPRISE is the Cruise... so I gotta write 10 lines, who thought of this, should have their kneecaps... so more about the movie... the child-drug dealer was pretty good, Stiller was good as was Downey but not so much a 'comedy' as a National Lampoon kind of film. enough lines yet? geesh more lines? well I keep going back to the good job Black and Cruise did, without them the movie would have not been nearly as much fun or enjoyable to watch... enough lines yet?? fingers getting tired... looks like this one last line will do it... not too soon either, my fingers are cramping and my butt is hurting from sitting and typing so many lines... but WATCH this movie (got it from redbox.com $1 a night)",8,1,3,30 November 2008
