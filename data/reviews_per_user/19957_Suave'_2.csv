The Blair Witch Project," Very unsettling movie whose hindsight reflections haunt you
","I viewed this movie probably knowing more about it than the average moviegoer. Granted, besides the incredible hype that has been generated, i can only wish that i knew LESS going in. The movie builds in visual and emotional intensity as the increasing plight of these three lost teens grows more and more sinister , hour after hour. Much is left unexplained, and unrevealed, leaving the audience to make its decisions for itself. This is a refreshing change from having CGI slammed down our collective throats. The simplistic nature of the cinematography grasps us in its fist and holds on until the final, harrowing scene. After it was over, I was uncertain what to think. What had I just seen? The images keep flooding in, usually while you're trying to drift off to sleep. This is what disturbs me the most. This is what makes The Blair Witch Project one of the most chilling movies out there.",10,1,2,29 July 1999
The Evil Dead," Better than any movie with 20 times the budget
","This is a classic. Period. Sam Raimi does with only the use of his camera, what 99% of directors couldn't do with a 100 million dollar budget. Raimi's use of the camera to add a sense of menace and to give life to the demonic force are fantastic. Stephen King was right on when describing this movie as 'grueling'. It wears you out visually and mentally, thoroughly succeeding in it's goal. That, and Ash kicks butt. What more do you need? See it now!!!",10,0,0,15 August 1999
