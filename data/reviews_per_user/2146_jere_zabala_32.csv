Resident Evil: Afterlife," The only good movies about Zombies, and OF COURSE it has a low ranking, human stupidity is infinite
","Einstain said it, he said this was going to happen... people like 'Godzilla 2019' which is 100% not Godzilla, but it is more like a giant ridiculous slow pokemon, but they hate this EPIC and THE ONLY WELL DONE MOVIE ABOUT ZOMBIES... they hate Dark Phoenix, THE BEST X MEN MOVIE EVER, EPIC, MUTANTS USE THEIR POWERS AS NEVER... But they love Endgame 3000... which was the worst ending of a franchise ever.. no Hulk, no Vision, no Ronin, no Black Widow...
THAT'S IT... THAT'S WHY THIS MASTERPIECE HAS A LOW RANKING... YOU PEOPLE SAID IT YOURSELVES, WITHOUT EVEN NOTICING IT :) Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former.
10/10 BEST FRANCHISE ABOUT ZOMBIES, THIS IS HOW U MAKE A ZOMBIE MOVIE.POSSERS GONNA HATE!",10,2,10,10 June 2019
Train to Busan," Not as good as Resident Evil movies, but the main actor is the sexiest man I've seen!
","It has some flaws, specially some scenes are a rip-off of War World Z movie, and predictable jumpcares like trash movies, for that I took some points off, it's not like many people say that it's the best zombie movie, but it's pretty entertaining, the main actor is extremely sexy by the way, and the acting are pretty good.",6,0,5,6 November 2019
Inglourious Basterds," Masterpiece, a film for smart people definitely!
","A masterpiece, best work from Tarantino so far! He generates a great tension in many scenes that explode in the smartest way possibly, with ton of violece and carefull gore and realism, amazing watched it like more than 10 times!",10,3,7,1 October 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," NOT a Star Wars movie, they confused the title or put it to sell, Nothing can be as epic as TLJ
","People who dont give this a 1/10, should be banned from the site, for not having at least the average intelligence to understand films.LET'S PRETEND THIS MOVIE NEVER HAPPENED AND DELETE IT FROM STAR WARS SAGA, PLEASE!!! THIS WAS NOT A STAR WARS MOVIE!!!! This didn't have any element of a Stae Wars movie, why such a high rank?? it's unffair! people are being posser these days, and they don't have own opinions, they just repeat what others say, that's why this disaster movie has people who 'liked' it, NO, NO NO AND NO!!!! The Last Jedi was a masterpiece, but if they dont attach to that path, and keep doing this HORRID WORKS, they will ruin this saga, ATTACH TO MAJESTIC AND MASTERFUL FILM THE LAST JEDI style and we're gonna be good.Rogue One, FIRST, it was extremely boring, second, it doesnt have any of the elements a star wars movie should BY LAW have, third, as a movie that has nothing to do with Star Wars, IT'S STILL EXTREMELY BAD! it has nothing good, sorry,",1,1,32,7 May 2019
Captain Marvel," Im giving it a 10, for the unfair hate people gave to the actress and this film
","The film is not a masterpiece, but it's not that bad, my rating goes because I'm tired of reading hate and senseless comments about the actress, about a false feminism many said this film had and IT HAVEN'T, and for many unfair insults people gave to this film and the BODY of the actress, I think those reviews should be deleted and those users should be banned, for discrimination to a woman, and specially to her PERFECT body, that many 'straight' guys critique from her.",10,14,40,11 March 2019
Aquaman," I am super hero fan since ever... but this was BORING! specially being fan of aquaman
","This movie was a failure, I waited a lot more of this, because of the trailer, this movie seemed to be epic, but it was boring and pointless, aquaman cartoon was so much better than this movie, and that is sad :/ A 7 SCORE IS SO UNFFAIR!!! this movie should be down of a 4!!! it seems that the people who ranks here dont know much about cinema :/",1,2,9,21 April 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Masterpiece, what the GODFATHER should have been but it never was.
","A film that only smart people will get it, this film is one of the best films of Marvel, MILLIONS times better than THE WINTER SOLDIER, which I ranked it with a 1/10 in this site, cause it has hundreds of flaws without saying the plot has already been done thousands of times before and it's SO BORING, but coming back to THOR RAGNAROK, it has a perfect script, perfect humor, actually, it's the only marvel movie that has a natural humor, the other ones are too forced, but this one is perfection in all ways.",10,3,25,28 April 2019
The Hateful Eight," Worst movie of Tarantino, even he is the reason I became cinephile since I was a kid :/
","It's kind of sad to me to say one work of my fav director and writter ever is bad... But If I didnt say it, I would be liying to myself and the public, cause everybody knows this was a weak work, I mean, it's a fact, it didn't have a plot, and after more than 1 hour, it finally the plot was arriving and then BOOM... the end... I couldn't believe it, a waste of time, dialogues very weak, just one place, lazy production, Tarantino lazy work I think, he wanted to make money Idk, because he's a great writer, but this was too weak :/",1,6,17,26 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," I never watched star wars movies cause I thought they were boring and commercial...MASTERPIECE
","I'm 29 years old and I never watched star wars movies cause I thought they were boring lightsaber fights with no meaning... and I was so wrong...I just watched the first 3 episodes(4,5,6) and I even cried with this last one, it's a masterpiece, it's not only about lightsabers fights, it's about politics, freedom, understanding, acceptance of all races with no discrimination, it's about equality, it's about love and union, about accepting others as they are, it's about how much powerful we all can be if we join together to reach a greater good, man, I love so so so much star wars already and I don't even understand why so much 'fans' give such a hate in many episodes of this franchise",10,3,10,19 April 2019
Suicide Squad," PERFECTION!!!!
","I didn't read the comics and I'm not interested either, but this film was pure addiction, everything was so perfect, the acting were sublime, the plot and script was so coherent, I need a second one, this wasnt enough!!!!",10,1,9,20 February 2019
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," the worst movie from marvel, boring, bad script, not smart plot, flat characters
","Thor Ragnarok is on my top 3 of best movies of marvel, cause it was epic, smart, fascinating, mystique, magical, esoteric, surprising, funny, even horrorific(hela scared me a little bit), and that's cinema, a visual travel that can cause you emotions, but this film is totally the opposite, not epic, plot we've seen millions of times in other movies, boring, nothing magical or mystical, totally predictable, I felt sleep 2 times trying to end of watching it, but it was a TORTURE!! Im used to complex plots, smart scripts, fascinating dialogues, philosophical characters, this film didnt have any of this, the rank in this film is so unffair, this definitely cant superpass a 4, the acting and producting is legit, but the movie itself is just so bad I can't give it more than 1, sorry :/ Im a marvel fan anyway :)",1,5,32,24 April 2019
Barry Lyndon," I just watched this film for the first time, being 29 years old, and I'm crying.. I wish I've could seen this gem sooner
","Wow... I'm just amazed... Kubrick it's some kind of gift for humanity, a gift from gods, his purity in their works are so ahead to this era, I can't describe it with words, I don't know if he was an alien who came with esoteric knowledge or some person from the future who came to give us advance knowledge in the field of cinema, but HOW? HOW Could he create something so advanced in cinematography??? and still no one can be compared to him, not even Tarantino one of my fav directors of all times? how?? I mean, I can't understand how complex and beautiful and outstanding are his films that only some few had the luck to see all that involves underneath them... Barry Lyndon is a soft caress to the soul, the first 1.30 hour it's stunning at how beautiful the photography is, but then, all his geniality comes to a new level of greatness, he superpasses hilmself in THE SAME FILM... how is that possible?? I'm crying cause... I just see the film and show products we have today, so lack of intelligence, passion in cinematography, so fitted to a hollywood formula, and I compare it these old gems of Kubrick, and it's so sad to know that we don't have someone like Kubrick in our lives anymore, in our time, to care about the doom of originality we have in today films industries... THIS MOVIE IS PASSION FOR CINEMA IN ALL SENSES AND DIRECTIONS.",10,5,8,20 August 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," MASTERPIECE.Best Star Wars movie of ALL times, BILLIONS times better than the trashy Endgame Movie
","BILLIONS times better than the trashy Endgame Movie, AND THE BEST star wars movie so far, NO PLACE TO DISCUSSION.PERIOD.
I cried with every single movie of SW, but I cried the most with this one, is beyond epic, amazing,mystique, fantastic, emotional, smart, brillant.
Rat kids love endgame because of the marketing, because that film was boring, with an horrible script and horrible acting Robert D. Junior, and had a terrible main plot destroying physic laws, with a poor war... that trash having better reviews than THIS MASTERPIECE, really proves that humanity is not as intelligent as we think, at least, the most of us aren't.",10,5,36,9 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," WOW.. I just watched it.. a MASTERPIECE, THE BEST STAR WARS MOVIE EVER
","EPISODE 5 WAS THE WORST STAR WAR MOVIE EVER, BUT THIS ONE GIVES US ALL WHAT IN THAT EPISODE FAILED SO BIG! People who gave this film a note under 10 should be banned from this site for not having at least the average intelligence to rank movies.This film is a masterpiece, sadly, only smart people liked it :/ the politics, yoda, the romance, THE JEDI ALL TEAMED UP TO FIGHT, anakin coming back for her mother, everything in this film is what ALL FANS HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR ALL OUR LIFE! and this is the real time where anakin starts becoming darth vader... I love all the episodes of the saga, I think they are all the best but this is the best one too xD",10,2,12,22 April 2019
Justice League," I Loved this movie!! but it's a scam, title is wrong, it's not a JUSTICE LEAGUE MOVIE! Green Lantern isnt here!
","I fraking loved this film!!! it has some flaws like superman being millions times faster than the flash, that has no logic at all, and makes flash looks 100% useless, and the ancient battle was too short I would have loved seeing more of that, but without that, the movie would have been excellent!! i love superman, batman so I of course I was gonna like it! :) so sad the title is wrong, producers confused it, that's a huge mistake for a big company, not knowing the name of the product you are selling, it's not very smart, but after that, the movie was pretty good! :)",1,1,22,5 May 2019
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," In the level of Terminator 2 but people are too dumb to go against possers trend
","Jumanji 90's movie was a classic, then it was completely ruined by the trash sequels in the last years, EVERYONE LOVED THOSE CRIME AND BLASFEMY MOVIES WITHOUT SAYING A WORD!!! but they get mad because of this sequel?? which is actually as good as T2 classic?? why people are so contradictory? that proves a low IQ in general public and customers, and how little they know about cinema.PERIOD.",10,9,12,5 November 2019
Avengers: Endgame," THE WORST culmination of 11 years, where was hulk? vision? dr strange? goose?proxima midnight? FAT THOR? really?
","As the only, UNIQUE, AND BIGGEST REAL FAN OF MARVEL, who loved every sigle movie, character, and comic from them, I have to give this movie a 1/10, so maybe they could delete it and make it again, but RIGHT this time... and let's pretend ENDGAME NEVER EXISTED...COME ON! BAN RUSSO'S BROTHERS FROM HOLLYWOOD FOREVER!! PLEASE!! DONT MAKE THEM DIRECT MORE MOVIES! THEY RUINED IT! the writers gave them a GOLDEN script, and Russo's TURNED IT INTO DUST! they ruined it totally!! where was vision??? hulk??? anyone??? cap lifting thor hammer?? really?? that's not any surprise, that's OBVIOUS! cap was even more worth than thor since the beginning!!!!! HULK should have lifted the hammer, that would have been epic!! and a surprise! but, where was him?? he didnt even fight... the strongest and original avenger... and he didn't even show up end in the last 2 movies of this era.... NO, NO AND NO! I should give these guys a lesson of how to write, produce and direct a movie, HUGE MISTAKES that even a 5 years old kid would have avoided!",1,35,67,1 May 2019
Batman Begins," HOLY CR@''#P... The DEFINITION OF 'MASTERPIECE'... Man... perfection in cinema exists
","8,2/10???? That rank should illegal in this film, perfection is not an 8, all the notes except the 10 should be forbidden to rank this film, 10/10.Perfection in cinema exists... and it's called Batman Begins/the dark knight and the dark knight rises... Chris Nolan is a genius... I just watched this movie for the first time in my life, Im 29, I had already watched the last 2 when I was younger, but never this one... man.. I can't describe a piece like this with words, all I can say is that I cried in many times while I was watching it, but not for sad scenes specifically, but because of how accurate, and perfectly, all the pieces came together showing you how BEAUTIFUL and powerful and outstanding can be a film when u take time to think and think and to think every single word, plot, twist, situation and emotion that goes and fits in the exact place and time, and because THIS IS LOVE FOR CINEMA, THIS IS PASSION!! THIS IS HOW U WRITE A SCRIPT!!! THIS IS ART, EMOTIONS, A SCREAM FROM THE DEEPEST OF A FILMMAKER'S SOUL!! it's not a simple super heroe movie... it's BATMAN.",10,3,7,25 May 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," A MASTERPIECE, WHAT THE GODFATHER SHOULD HAVE BEEN! HATERS ARE NOT SMART
","As a cinephile since I'm a little little kid, and being 28 y.o. now, I have to say this is THE BEST FILM ever made, to the date, EVERYTHING IS PERFECTION, the script, the production, the cinematography, the jokes, the acting, the characters, the construction of every aspect and hue of the plot, the music, a perfect example of that human beings even we have differences, we are all in the same side, and we have to let those differences aside and join to defend what is right, no matter what, it's an example of courage, human values, sacrifice for others, IT'S A PERFECT EXAMPLE to teach and educate kids, about how important is the respect to each other, MAGNIFICENT! it leaves you a message, a beautiful and powerful message, unlike the over-hyped GODFATHER, that doesn't leaves you anything except a bad taste about deaths and crime, no teaching, nothing.Avengers: Infinity War It's like the perfect movie I've been expecting all my life without even knowing it, 10 OUT OF 10, MASTERPIECE.Period.",10,8,18,23 May 2018
Django Unchained," I was a Tarantino fan, till this movie...
","I have been always a fan of Tarantino, he made me love cinema, but this is his second worst movie, he lost his spark in this one, nothing different to his previous films, it was very very boring.",4,3,14,23 May 2018
X-Men: Apocalypse," I'm so fan of the x men since Im a child that I can't give it less than a 10 sorry :/
","I love all this universe since I'm a child, and no matter what they do, when it's about x men, it's a bomb! I loved this as I enjoyed the the other 5 films, no more either less! it's an epic film with the group of characters we all love!!",10,0,6,21 February 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," EPIC! MASTERPIECE! MAJESTIC! people who dont give it a 10 should be banned from this site
","EPIC! MASTERPIECE! MAJESTIC! MASTERFUL! OUTSANDING! PERFECTION! totally the opposite to the EPISODE V, which is DEFINITELY the worst of the saga, this is STAR WARS and it has all the elements of it, AND MUCH MUCH MUCH MORE, people who didnt give this film a 10 should be banned forever of this site for not having the at least the minimum understanding of Star Wars story and universe.There is not gonna be any star wars film that will ever superpass this, people didnt get it because its very complex and has a lot of layers one above another, like Twin Peaks, Inception, or THE OA, but way more complex.
This movie is only gonna be understood as a masterpiece just for the smartest fans, because it's actually outstanding, and it doesnt have the flaws of the worst film of the saga(episode V), it's a wonderful travel to the star wars heart in its finest way!",10,8,45,16 April 2019
Logan," WOW... I just watched it, Im breathless and speechless...
","I thought this was gonna be boring, slow, and pointless, a dramma about nothing... I was so wrong... this is so raw... so perfectly imperfect... so HUMAN... Tarantino made me fall in love with cinema... and films like this one, reminds me how much I love it... the tension in this is, ahg, I can't discribe it with words, this is perfection, we all grew up with these characters, they were like gods, and look at them now, they are so humans, and weak, and trying to survive like everyone else, the concept of FAMILY is represented here in such a amazing way, the characters picked in this film are so so so SUBLIME, a masterpiece, I grew up with x men, and I felt in my flesh everything they were suffering, like if they were some frinds of me or part of my family, that's how well done is this film made... A 11/10... Im gonna keep crying!!! :(",10,2,5,20 February 2019
The Dark Knight," Good but not as good as Batman Begins, that one was a masterpiece, this is the weakest of the trilogy
","This film was absolutely and indisputable the weakest film of the Nolan trilogy, All Nolan works have been impecable, except this one, there's nothing about this one that comes out, its a good film in general, but man, so many many many foozles, the first one is never gonna be superpassed, in this one, there are a lot of mistakes in the script, HUGE hole plots, not gothic as the other two, no no no, 9/10??? who are the people ranking in this site? kids??? how could anyone not see OBVIOUS failures in this film??? even my little son noticed them... Im kind of mad that most people come to rank a movie in this site and don't even know a sigle thing of what cinema means... I'm done... 4/10, that's my rank for this movie and the average rank this movie should, no more, no less.",4,2,11,26 May 2019
The Witch," As a horror fan, One of the worst movies I've ever watched.
","I can't believe there are people that liked this, but no one gives 1 sigle argument why they liked it xD, It's HORRIFIC! but not in the good sense, it's extremely boring, there's no witch, there's no horror, and there's almost no talking, and the little of talking is about crazy parents mistreating their children, till the end of the movie I was wondering, and??? when does the horror come??? or is this just a mute drama??? and... IT WAS JUST A REALLY BAD DRAMA MOVIE, 1/10, It's not a horror movie, it has no genre actually, I can't give it 0 but I would give it that score if I could, 100% BAD.Waste of time.",1,8,19,8 November 2018
Joker," Masterpiece, in the level of Dark Knight saga,
","This decade has so many super heroe trash movies like avengers endgame, that we really needed a good film to fill the empty hole the dark knight saga had left... Finally it arrived, and it's THE JOKER, a magnetic drama film that turns into a psychotic political thriller with rough critics to the capital power and richness, and the birth of the biggest and most charismatic anti hero ever seen, SUBLIME! not less than 10/10.",10,2,7,8 October 2019
Sherlock Holmes," A Karate/action movie, nothing to do with Sherlock Holmes!!! Blasfemy 100%
","This film did a sacrilege, Sherlock Holmes is about detective, investigation, crime, mistery, but this film was a KARATE/ACTION MOVIE!!! GOD!! How could they ruin so so so bad a Classic like this!!!! the people who made this film should be banned of making any film ever again!!! I was not disappointed after watching it, I was pissed off, things like this cant turn into a Hollywood movie, it just cant!",1,0,8,19 March 2019
Parasite," OMG... this is how I was almost the whole movie, with the hand in my mouth and my eyes wide open.
","This was like watching the Godfather, Inception and The Panic room in a refined version of the 20's... but with its own bizarre, funny, and at the same time beautiful unique style that only Bong Joon could make... 8,6/10???? this is a 10/10 film, Bong Joon is one of the best writers/directors in the world, Okja was the ultimatum film that defined he was a genius, his first 'masterpiece', and he did it again this time! such a elegant film, with such a perfect timing and edition, for moments it looked like an orchestra more than a film, actually, the whole film has beautiful classic orchestra in the background, a beautiful piece of music called orchestra that hides another orchestra but more complex, creepy and sad called life, it's like a methaphore inside a methaphore, inside of a more complex methaphore, u get it??? IT'S FREAKING GENIUS!! the first minutes of the movie were a little slow, like all the Bong Joon films, but I knew the rythm will come, and how it arrived was brillant, the tension was exquisite, the photography is so clean, the art of this film is so refined as all the other elements, script, acting, plot, HOW CAN SOMEONE GIVE THIS BRILLANT FILM SOMETHING LESS THAN 10??? WHO LET THAT PEOPLE VOTE PLEASE!!! 8,6/10 IS THE REASON WHY WE HAVE SHARKNADO MOVIES IN THE RUNNING TIMES :/",10,3,9,19 February 2020
Wonder Woman," As a wonder woman fan since child, this was an insult!
","The actress is amazing and I love her, but I just think she didn't have nothing to do with wonder woman, since the beginning you know something is not right, and finally understood it was because of the actress, besides the plot and story is extremely bad and boring :/ a total disappointment, I waited a lot for this movie, I used to watch the 70's tv series of wonder woman and it was amazing, and it's sad that show was way more better than this film.",1,3,22,6 March 2019
Black Panther," The weakest film from Marvel
","It's a good film, to see just once... It has many failures, the story is not that strong, it has some good characters, but nothing special about the whole film",5,5,12,23 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," THE worst star wars movie EVER, The Last Jedi is still the best by far :/ this had no plot
","The characters are the only thing that saved this film, different to the last film THE LAST JEDI which brings us the heart, emotions, epicity, of what star wars truly is, which is smarter, more complex and have not as flaws as this film had, people just repeat what others say, cant believe that this piece of trash had more positive reviews that a masterpiece like the last jedi is, that makes me lose faith in humanity sometimes, its like, u have to give easy, basic and dumb scripts to people, cause if u give them something mystique, magical, epic, complex, like the last jedi, they don't understand it and hate it with no arguments, here in this film, the sound effects almost made me vomit, the plot... well... it had no plot, so it was extremely boring, as the only real fan of star wars, my rating is honest and should be considered as the most important vote.",1,4,58,16 April 2019
The Godfather," 1/10, the most overestimated ever made, and one of the worst
","The only people who could give to this film a note over 1, are people who have never watched too many films(like my father,he says it's a masterpiece, but he don't like cinema, he just repeats what most people say), as a cinephile, this film has a lot of failures, and obviously not the best film in its genre, and it can't have this rank just because 'it shows how italian family and organized crime is', that's a silly and empty argument, you people got to have better arguments TO RANK A FILM! more knowledge, watch more movies, study cinema history and cinema production!!! you can't give this film a 10 just because 'it's a classic' or because 'everyone has heard about this film', JUST DON'T, the people who liked this or call it a masterpiece, with all the respect, are people who don't like cinema too much or don't know much about it, sorry, but that is a fact.It's a good film, but compared to he thousands of films ever made, it's one of the worst.",1,7,30,23 May 2018
