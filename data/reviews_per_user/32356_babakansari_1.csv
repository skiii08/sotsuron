The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Do yourself a favour
","Do not waste your time and money by going to this movie. I haven't watched the previous parts but I knew the story. The whole story could be told in 5 minutes. Nothing new in new series, while the old one didn't have much! I understand the movie was probably targeted for youth but I love to watch cartoons that are for kids. The only nice thing in this movie was the main actor Jennifer Lawrence who looked beautiful but it is not limited to this movie (She looks gorgeous on any movie she played or any media).I wish there was score ZERO so that I could vote it for this movie.The worst movie I have ever seen in Movie Theater by far!",1,26,38,7 December 2014
