Kill Bill: Vol. 2," common
","It's said that These 2 movies are very good. The Director of Kill Bill is KD,TR. The most of people are think that he is very good at directing film. KT is a super fan of action movie. So fights are full of his movies. But compare with china's Kong Fu moves, his movies are very low. There is a Chinese Master of Kong FU in the film of Kill Bill, named BaiMei. The master who tech Woman-actor is a serious man. It looks like Chinese style. But, meanwhile, the master is a madcap man too, and this feature led him to die. Violence is the sign of his movies. I think violence not only fight each other between two guys or more. The story of Kill Bill is a revenge story of one woman kill a man. Actually, this film can't attract me.",5,0,2,9 October 2016
