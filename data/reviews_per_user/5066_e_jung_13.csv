Ford v Ferrari," 7000 RPM
","Passion, devotion, friendship. Absolute fantastic, fast paced and well written experience from start to finish. Loved the chemistry between the two main characters. Christian Bale was absolutely outstanding, and even though he had done this before, the body transformation from portraying Dick Chaney to Ken Miles still just makes me want to stand up and clap my hands. His determination and commitment to the role is on another level, not achievable to most actors out there. I've read that the main reason Damon wanted to do this movie, was to be able to work with Bale. Seemed like they two knew each other for years and have done dozens of movies together. The fight scene was hilarious!As somebody who didn't know the story at all or have had any interest in Le Mans, the racing footage was excellent and well presented. It really makes you sad when Ken was cheated out of winning it but you can see he didn't care. He wasn't in it for fame.Go and see it on the big screen while you can. It's a hell of a ride at 7000 RPMs!",9,6,13,23 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," You're a Jedi Knight, aren't you?
","I never had a chance to watch the first Star Wars trilogy as they were released, due to not being born yet. Phantom Menace is the first one that I remember watching. The VHS was probably broke after all these times I watched it as a kid.I can see why this movie didn't hold up to the expectations of the fans at the time, it's a classic pattern of 'it's not as good as the old ones'. I never do that, I look at the movies all individually. And Star Wars Episode I is a damn good movie without a doubt. Does it have directorial or acting flaws? Yes, it does. But it also has all that I want to see in a Star Wars movie. There is a lot of sentimentality for me when it comes to movies like that which probably affects the score but who cares? Darth Maul had remained one of my favourite characters in the whole franchise, never got over the fact that there was't more story to this character. That racing scene... Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan, Jar Jar Binks, young Anakin, fantastic Portman as Amidala, Darth Maul... what's not to like?",7,0,1,21 January 2020
3:10 to Yuma," Sometimes a man has to be big enough to see how small he is
","I've never been a big fan of remakes, but this is one of the ones you can't ignore. It has everything that a good wester should have. There is nothing new I can say about Bale and Crowe's performance, but I feel like Ben Foster doesn't get enough credit for his part in that film. I think he was perfect for that role. There is a lot you can learn from both of the main characters. I loved the moment when Wade finally understood Dan's point of view. My favourite western in the post-Eastwood era.",9,2,2,16 November 2019
The Irishman," I heard you paint houses
","This was the last chance Scorsese could pull this off and he did it. All the legends together again in this amazing picture. In a way, this feels like a farewell to this genre. There will never be anything like that created ever again. I mean, will there be more gangster movies? Sure. But the bar is set too high now. It's been set too high since Goodfellas in 1990. Nothing will come close to what Scorsese, De Niro, Pacino and Pesci had achieved. The Irishman is an instant classic and I have no doubts that in 30 years it will be worshipped the same way we do worship Goodfellas or Casino.One of the things I love about Scorsese is the atmosphere and authenticity he creates with simplicity of his shots sometimes. You could lock me up for 25 years and then show me the first scene of The Irishman and I could tell you it's Marty.Shame on UK cinemas for boycotting this release. Because of that I was not able to see it on the big screen. First time since I can remember, I didn't go to the cinema to see new Scorsese. I bet it would have tasted even better.",8,5,9,6 December 2019
The Prestige," But where's his brother?
","Every time I watch this film, it gets better. Every time I watch it, I have a different point of view. Every time I watch it, I discover something new about it.Christopher Nolan at his best. Jackman, Serkis and Bowie were great, Bale was absolutely phenomenal. In my opinion, it was one of the best single best performances of all time. Sometimes with my favourite movies, I wish we could just erase part of the memory and watch it 'fresh' again.... but The Prestige only gets better. When you watching the movie for the second time knowing the ending, you can focus on details. Bale's performance goes above 10/10. Nolan's directing goes above 10/10.One of my favourite movies of all time. If you reading this after seeing this movie once and you liked it - watch it again. Trust me.",10,4,6,27 October 2019
Lost in Translation," Let's never come here again because it would never be as much fun
","I gave this movie a 10 some years ago and last night I decided to refresh my memory to see why. The rating didn't change, and if I could rate it higher, I would.An old actor who has everything meets a young beautiful woman who at this stage has... nothing? They are both lost in some way, they don't know what to do with their life anymore (sounds familiar?). And they connected.Lost in Translation is like a collection of small details from our lives that everyone will encounter at some point or already can relate to them in one way or another.The mood, absolutely beautiful cinematography, mesmerising shots of Tokyo. Watch it, it will stay with you for a long time after.",10,1,1,19 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," I've had the most peculiar dream
","Well, this one is definitely the weakest one in the trilogy. While there was some good fighting scenes in it, in general it does lack some of the serious action that would be expected.My biggest issue with that one is very poor CGI. I don't mean looking at the outdated special effects from the perspective of current times but even back then it felt and looked cheap. I think that Episode I had better CGI actually. Writing... not sure about that one too, poor dialogue between characters, very noticeable in the Anakin - Padme scenes.It's not all bad though, I did really enjoy the scenes with Jango Fett and Obi-Wan, and seeing how Stormtroopers came to be as well as Yoda vs Count Dooku scene. 6/10 might sound like a stretch but I still enjoying watching it even though it is at least half an hour too long.",6,0,0,5 February 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Don't cry in front of the Mexicans
","Does it feel a bit long? Yes it does, but if you ask me what scenes would I remove to make it shorter I couldn't tell you. Acting and storyline were fantastic. Pitt and DiCaprio gave great performances, Leo especially. I mean, year after year, he simply delivers. Beautiful cinematography, I really felt that Hollywood vibe back then. Loved the humour too, laughed more during that movie than when watching comedies nowadays.",8,2,2,16 November 2019
Dog Day Afternoon," I'm a Catholic, I don't want to hurt anybody
","This is probably my favourite Pacino performance of all time. He takes a movie to a top level, single-handedly. It's smart, gritty, funny and just simply enjoyable. Dog Day Afternoon will give you this great New York vibe in the 70s, even if you never been there. The story is great itself, I mean who doesn't like stories like that? Sidney Lumet is showing what true filmmaking is about.",10,2,2,4 November 2019
Where Eagles Dare," Oh, swell. Do you have any other surprises I should know about?
","This one is certainly entertaining. Long, yeah, but I'm not sure if it feels like it. Great plot with some good twists. Enough good action and explosives there too, I imagine that it must have been good experience to be able to see it in the cinema back in the day. I think it aged well too, I can name quite a few movies from early 2000s that look worse than that already.I probably won't be rushing to watch it again, but if I stumble on it on TV I won't be rushing to change the channel either.",7,0,0,19 May 2020
Reservoir Dogs," Hey, why am I Mr. Pink?
","What a strong debut! I don't know how Tarantino managed to get such a great cast for his movie being unknown part-time actor and writer at the time, but somehow he did, and they all delivered a fantastic performance. He landed on the map with a bang, no doubts about it.Simple but good story with amazing dialogue, the opening scene at the restaurant remains one of my favourite scenes of all time.",8,0,0,16 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Into exile I must go, failed I have
","The Revenge of The Sith is my personal favourite in the trilogy. It is the most mature and dark one of all, with some great scenes, and introduction of Darth Vader. The CGI didn't feel cheesy this time, even though it didn't age that well. There was some great lightsaber action (if not the best of all time), the transformation from Anakin to Darth Vader was well presented and we had some very brave scenes like the one with younglings. Out of the three, it is the best written, without the shadow of a doubt.Even though acting is not great at times and the movie still feels a bit long (you could easily remove some scenes) and as mentioned before the CGI didn't age all that well, for me it is a strong 8/10 and one of my favourites from the whole franchise.",8,1,1,5 February 2020
Marriage Story," Criminal lawyers see bad people at their best, divorce lawyers see good people at their worst
","Fantastic movie that is pretty painful to watch. There will be so many people out there who can relate to exactly the same issues as the ones shown in this picture. It is immensely accurate in the portrayal of a struggling family. People really do change over time and I think the story of Nicole and Charlie is a perfect example of when two characters are growing apart, even thought you couldn't' probably pin point how they changed or what the exact problem is.I think both, Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver deserve some recognition for their roles and I was really gutted that neither of them got an Oscar (even though I'm not a big fan of the Academy Awards). Driver had some tough competition out there but I believe Johansson well deserved the statue.In a nutshell: Great acting, great writing, no crap - watch it. Well done Netflix.",8,6,9,21 February 2020
