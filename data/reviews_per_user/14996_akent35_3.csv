Frost_Nixon," EXCELLENT Movie!
","I enjoyed this movie immensely! Frank Langella was perfect as Richard Nixon, and Micheal Sheen nails it as David Frost. And for me, the film was certainly eye opening and educational.It's fascinating that there are at least 3 other excellent treaties of both Nixon and the Viet Nam War: All The President's Man, the recent PBS series The Vietnam War, and the soon-to-be release of The Post. I just might 'binge' watch All The President's Men, Frost/Nixon, and The Vietnam War PBS series. I am sure it would be entertaining!",10,0,0,23 December 2017
Glory," Excellent Revelation of History Not Taught in School!
","This movie, just like 'Schindler's List', is an eye opener! I had never been aware that a black contingent of Union soldiers ever existed. But, am I glad I was woke up! The story (just about all true) is historical, heart warming, and triumphant. To even think that such a regiment of soldiers, fighting against so many enemies, could distinguish themselves is the ultimate.The performances by Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, and Morgan Freeman were just so, so outstanding. They certainly portrayed the events in superlative ways. I just hope this movie is being used in history classes in schools, especially in the US. It is definitely a part of US history that needs to be remembered by all.",10,1,2,18 February 2014
All the President's Men," Definitely Eye Opening!
","What an excellent film! Robert Redford, Dustin Hoffman, and Jason Robards are superb in their respective roles. And it sure is an accurate retelling of the events surrounding Watergate.To me, it would be ideal to watch All The President's Men, Frost/Nixon, and the superb PBS series The Vietnam War one after another. There would be so many connections, revelations, etc. between all of them. And, there is the soon-to-be release of The Post, which should have connections to that PBS series (and maybe All The President's Men).",10,2,2,23 December 2017
