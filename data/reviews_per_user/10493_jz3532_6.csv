The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," A Huge Disappointment
","Besides Noah, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 was the worst movie I have seen from 2014. The repetitive boring nonsense that made up the film literally put me to sleep. The movie followed this single formula for the entire film: 1. Make Katniss propaganda movie. 2. Show people in Districts get mad at Capitol. 3. Capitol gets mad and either attacks the districts, makes Peeta make a propaganda film, or both. 4. Repeat. It is also completely ridiculous how stupid the final attack from president Snow is. How was Peeta going to kill Katniss when he knows there are going to be guards around her? Why didn't he hypnotize all of the other tributes? Why didn't he just say, 'Bring Katniss here or I will kill Peeta.' Then send videos of Peeta being tortured to District 13 and drive Katniss crazy? The whole point of 'Hunger Games' is so there can be actual 'Hunger Games'! Not some boring political bull sh*t. The first movie was entertaining. The Second was an improved version of the first. The third was a boring pile of sh*t.",5,19,29,30 November 2014
In Bruges," In Bruges Review
","In Bruges is a 2008 film directed and written by Oscar winner Martin McDonagh, and I don't know why this man has only directed 2 feature films. The movie follows two hit-man that are sent to Bruges by their boss to wait for further instructions after a hit gone wrong. Colin Farell plays 'Ray', a young and obnoxious hit-man who wants nothing more than to leave Bruges and never come back. Brendan Gleeson plays 'Ken', Ray's more older, experienced partner, who wants to take in the beauty of the city while they are there. Both of the characters play off of each other in a hilarious way, and it adds to the black comedy of the movie. Ralph Finnes especially shines, even though he does not show up until 75% into the film. That's my brief rundown, now for spoiler time!WARNING: 'DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IN BRUGES' spoilers below I especially enjoyed the third act of the film, and thought it was a fantastic climax. The ending showed death, redemption, sacrifice, humor, and most importantly dreams. It wasn't until a second watch that I started to notice the theme of dreams recurring in the film. The character Chloe said that the movie that was being shot with the midgets was a dream sequence, and when Harry asked ken on the phone what Ray thought of Bruges, Ken said Ray called it dream-like, and the finale of the film takes place in this dream sequence movie set. I am probably reading too much into this, but maybe was Rays test to redeem himself and he succeeded, sending him to heaven at the end of the film, and the dream messages were telling us that the entire film is a dream, and it is only god testing Ray or something. (Keep in mind this is coming from and atheist) I think this is a cool theory to think of, even though it is probably all a stupid coincidence.This movie has probably one of the best screenplays of recent times. the dialog between the main two characters can be hilarious, dramatic, and even sad when it needs to be. The writer and director, Martin McDonagh has a great way of grabbing the audience, and not letting go, his great work on this film allows the audience to feel completely immersed in the film. Don't even take my word for it, Roger Ebert gave it 4 stars, and called it a fantastic character study. The movie is on Netflix instant, and VOD. If you're looking for a funny, thrilling sad, heartwarming good time definitely check out In Bruges.",9,0,0,5 September 2015
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut Review
","Some people might not see it, but South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is a very meta movie. The Terrence and Phillip movie Asses of Fire is pretty much an analogy for this movie, and the rest of the film is an over-exaggerated reenactment of how people reacted to the movie. When I first saw this film, I saw it as nothing more than some fart jokes and a bunch of cursing, but now that I am seeing it again at an older age, I realize that it is actually brilliant satire of censorship and the MPAA.The film follows Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman as they see the new Terrence and Phillip movie. This causes them to become more vulgar and rowdy, and the rest plays out like an long South Park episode. I was always was a fan of South Park, and would watch it whenever it came on, and this film is made for South Park fans, so obviously I would enjoy it. The humor of the show is a very specific type of comedy, and doesn't stray from that, so people who do not like that comedy, don't like all of South Park, and people who like that comedy, love all of South Park. This is why in the Animated Musical HoF, everyone who participates either hates the movie, or loves it. You can pretty much separate the whole world into people who like South Park, and people who don't.Like Monty Python and the Holy Grail every single line of this film is a joke. There is no moments where they comedy is stopped. Even when they are trying to deliver a serious message, they always do it in a comedic way. The actual jokes are very funny, and are exactly what I expect from Trey Praker and Matt Stone, but I think that there are episodes of South Park that are more funny, and I wish that they went all out for the movie. Because instead of watching this movie, I would just recommend you to watch the 4 best episodes of the show back to back, it would be more funny. This isn't really a huge problem, and it didn't lose the film many points, but I think you should only turn a TV show into a movie, you have to do something you can't do on TV. This is the same problem I had with The Simpsons Movie.And now about that brilliant satire I was talking about earlier. A while ago I watched a documentary called This Film is Not Yet Rated it was a documentary about the MPAA, and how they constantly like to screw over filmmakers. Violence and blood barley bother them, while cursing and sex make them give films the dreaded NC-17 rating. There are many cleverly hidden lines about the MPAA in this film, and I imagine must have been hard to get past them. There were lines in the film were they said that violence is fine for children, but how dare they say certain words. Isn't 'sticks and stones may break my bones' what we teach children? One of my favorite things about South Park is that it is always the children that realize when something is bad instead of the adults. I now see this movie as an argument against censorship, and I think that it is much smarter than many people give it credit for.I have now tried to explain why South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is pretty brilliant. In my opinion, the whole movie was an analogy for censorship, and they threw a Saddam and Satan love affair in there just for fun. I think Terrence and Phillip represented freedom of speech, and MAC was the MPAA. It is a very far-fetched theory, and is probably wrong. This review was way longer that I thought it would be, so I'm gonna end it now. If you like South Park, like satire, and don't mind some cursing, this is the movie for you.(This review was originally written on Movie Forums July 30th 2015)",8,0,0,28 September 2015
Interstellar," Good?
","Is Interstellar a terrible mash of science mumbo jumbo and sappy boring clichés? No. Is Interstellar the greatest movie made in the last 30 years? Absolutely not. While it was an entertaining movie, it really isn't as good as everyone is praising it as. Christopher Nolan is an incredible director, and I love movies like Memento and The Dark Knight, but I felt like this was not one of his best movies. While it sounds like I am looking negatively on the film, I actually really enjoyed it, but not as much as I was hoping to. The thing that really bugged me with the film was its predictability. I figured out pretty quickly that Matthew McConaughey was going to be the ghost in Merf's room, and as soon as Anne Hathaway brought up that love is the most powerful thing in the universe, I knew the two would be connected. I thought that the visuals, performances, and music was fantastic, but the script and plot really failed for me. Either was, this was a very entertaining movie.",6,0,2,30 November 2014
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation
","I was neves a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible franchise. The only other installment in the series I had seen was Ghost Protocol and I would probably just describe it as 'meh'. So when my friends and I decided to go see Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol, I was expecting that same meh quality, but I was pleasantly surprised.The film follows Ethan Hunt, who is forced to track down the Syndicate, a network of highly skilled operatives who are dedicated to establishing a new world order. He and his team must also face the CIA, after the IMF is disbanded. The biggest problem I had with the movie was the use of exposition. Many of the scenes were just people talking to each other, and over-explaining the plot. This is something that frequently occurs in action movies, and is the biggest issue with the genre. What I enjoyed about films like Mad Max: Fury Road is that it knew it was an action movie, and didn't have a large amount of boring talking scenes, just action. I enjoyed the characters, even though they were very clichéd. My favorite character in the film was Simon Pegg's I thought he was the most unique, and was much easier to relate to than Ethan Hunt. I am glad he got more screen time in this film than in Ghost Protocol.The thing that this film by far does the best is action. Everyone has now heard of Tom Cruise hanging on to a plane, but there were also many other fun action sequences I was glad they didn't spoil in the trailer. My favorite scene in the movie was the opera scene. I loved how we were discovering what was happening while it was happening. They realized the audience was smart enough that they didn't have to explain to us what was going on, something many action movies do. I also enjoyed the underwater sequence, even though it was very cheesy and over-the-top. I also tried and miserably failed to hold my breath along with Tom Cruise. The car/motorcycle chases were also fun.I would not go to this film if you are expecting anything more than a good time. If you liked any of the other Mission:Impossible films, you will like this one. I thought it was done well, or at least could have been done a lot worse.(This review was originally written on Movie Forums August 2nd 2015)",6,1,4,28 September 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Mad Max Fury Road Review
","As I previously said in my Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior review, my expectations were set pretty high for Mad Max: Fury Road due to all of the praise surrounding it, and I would definitely say these expectations were met. This is probably one of the better recent action flicks, and it reminded me of movies like Speed where the action literally could not stop. While in my opinion it wasn't better than The Road Warrior this film was still very fun, and felt like it could proudly stand on its own, away from the trilogy.The film follows Max and Furiosa as they try to steal a tanker from an evil dictator and bring his wives to a fantasy-like green place that Furiosa was born in. Unlike the more attached to civilization environments from the original trilogy, Fury Road replaces them with a barren wasteland of dust. I liked this choice for the movie because it makes the audience feel like there is no hope left at all, a theme the film seemed to be going for. To me this film was much more impressive on a technical level than anything else. While I was worried that the use of CGI would damage the film, I was glad to see that it wasn't over used, and when it was used, it was used very well. The lighting and color scheme was also great as the movie changed from the the bright orange day time to the light teal blue nighttime. While teal and orange is defiantly not an original color palette (look up teal and orange movie posters) I thought it was used very well in this film.To me Mad Max: Fury Road did not feel like a Mad Max film, it felt like a post-apocalyptic action movie that was heavily inspired by the trilogy. They changed the character, the landscape, and the plot structure, and while this wasn't a bad choice, it made me leave the theater thinking I didn't just watch a Mad Max movie.All in all, even though it had its flaws, the movie didn't take itself too seriously and was simply fun. Watch the trailer, and if you think it looks like fun, then you will like the movie. Also if you liked this film, I would definitely recommend The Road Warrior because in my opinion it is much better. Mad Max: Fury Road was a lot of fun, and the best action movie yet this year.",7,4,6,5 September 2015
