United 93," Excellent pacing!
","The way this film paces itself is likely its greatest attribute. It's one long crescendo, beginning fairly dry and slow as we are intruduced to numerous characters at the beginning of what will end most hellishly.The focus of the film is primarily the events that take place, and secondarily with the reactions of the characters to these events. The film never gets very personal when it comes to the characters themselves, which is perhaps an observanvce by the filmmakers that, given the horrible things that happen to each of them, it would be less respectful to those victims to explore them very deeply. That's not to say we don't see emotion, as we certainly see plenty. I personally have a great deal of respect for how these characters are portrayed, as to pretend that any of us who never knew the real people they represent would be repugnantly presumptuous; only those who really knew them are intitled to that real insight.The movie picks up the pace constantly - growing ever more tense with each scene - until it becomes utterly frantic and horrifying. The pace of the film is brought home in the final moments as 93 hits the ground.Stylisticly, United 93 is simply brilliant.",Null,0,0,21 May 2007
