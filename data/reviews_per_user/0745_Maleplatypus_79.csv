The Avengers," One more masterpiece from Mr. Whedon - marvelous Marvel
","It is just amazing how this man (Mr. Whedon) turns anything into gold. Although there were some restrains and limits (given characters and all) to this story, Mr. Whedon and all (literally everybody) involved in production of this movie gave their best and made it one of the best American movies in many years. It is, however, a tough job to keep everything in balance ('superheroes' and other childish and trivial stuff, producers' requests...) but despite of it Mr. Whedon did it again and exceeded by far all my expectations. I must note that he is at his best when his hands are not tied (Firefly & Serenity or Hush from Buffy, for example) and he's given full creative freedom but this movie is really something else. I've watched all the movies with separate characters involved (Thor, Captain America, Hulk and so on) and they were surprisingly good (although main characters only here gave their best). But this... Amazing! So witty, so fun, so close to reality ('making sense') as it can possibly be, so full of those details that make your eyes sparkle and your brain filling with serotonin. Mr. Whedon knows how to pull out the best from anybody he's working with. Such a rare and precious gift and so NOT Hollywood. Maybe that's why he is so damn underestimated by Hollywood's and television mainstream)Not only highly recommended but a must see. Again and again.",10,2,5,23 June 2012
The Expendables 2," Better than the first one
","So, if 'acting' does not count (and in this kind of movie it really shouldn't - some deserve a free pass :), everything else is much better than the first movie. Especially the story. Don't get me wrong: it has been obviously designed for a classic black/white presentation, where good guys are always good, and bad are even worse. The are also some quotes on movie classics (you know: terrorized village graving for help, some stranger(s) come(s) and blah, blah, blah) and it is altogether fun. Nice 100 minutes (with credits). Mindless but fun nevertheless. Arnie is finally 'back' (after so many promises), nobody beats Chuck Norris (I guess jokes about him are true; most of them) and it all looks like a nice geriatric party (only shooting, no singing). Like Space Cowboys (God forgive for comparing this two movies!) but with no space.Want fun? Go for it. It delivers. Much, much more than, for example, Mission Impossible. I'm looking forward for 3rd part (if most of the cast does not die of age, since bullets don't want them).",7,2,2,12 October 2012
Skyfall," Bond at his best
","I guess a disclaimer should be in order for starters: This is a personal opinion. So, as with the last Batman trilogy, the same goes for Bond. Finally we have excellent movies with respectable characters and everything and everybody involved in production. Imagineed 'superheroes' are brought down to Earth, became human and regained dignity they deserve. I simply love Mr. Craig as Bond. He is not a clown or some careless playboy any more, winning the game with barely 2 per cent of his efforts, mainly because he has not only psychotic but essentially stupid opponents. After Mr. Lazenby has shown us raw model ('how to behave as a secret service employee'), Mr. Craig is the best Bond ever (yes, including Mr. Connery - sorry, ladies). And, yes, I've followed Bond movies since the beginning. Mr. Bardem is the best opponent (including Mr. Brandauer in Never Say Never Again, who was fantastic) he had so far. Truly an exquisite movie (all elements included) with few minor flaws (therefore 9/10 stars), probably due to production requirements. Finally, Bond meets my taste :)Anyway, go for it and enjoy.",9,2,15,3 December 2012
Child 44," Good movie, despite many flaws
","I'm quite fascinated by the Hollywood's efforts to destroy a good story. And fails, in this case. Good direction, exquisite performances by the cast, more than a correct editing and choice of music and so on on one side. On the other side, during SSSR, no one ever said to anyone 'Yes, sir'. There were no 'sirs'. Just 'comrades'. If you place movie in Russia, let it at least look like Russia at that period. Not so many cars on the streets, not so nice buildings (as in Prague, where the filming took place). Let actors speak plain English (or Russian) and, for God's sake!, DO NOT spoil everything with some fake Russian accent. This is not the first time that Hollywood uses English with some foreign accent (Book Thief?). Why? What's the message? You do not have any idea how irritating this is. Also, in one scene, when Leo and Raisa change clothes, Tom Hardy is clearly seen wearing jeans. Jesus! So many stupid (producers'?) acts and yet the movie is very good, well told. And I recommend it as a crime story, but very far from historic facts.",8,4,9,5 September 2015
Inglourious Basterds," Some kind of Wolfenstein but not that good
","To me Mr. Tarantino is a strange and an odd entity. As a director of his movies, he's pretty good, but as everything else ... I've watched this one for the third time now and am finally ready to write a review. Where do I start? He's unpredictable at storytelling. Sometimes good, sometimes bad and sometimes unbearable horrific, the basic problem being - he does not know how to finish the story/movie so he abruptly just stops. Or, as in this case, invents some fictitious plot, thus prolonging the 'experience' for at least one unnecessary hour. Otherwise good actors (except for Mr. Waltz who never performs bad, no matter what) perform horribly as on purpose. Like in exploitation movies. In this movie the 'good guys' are presented as in the title, being no better than their enemy. Mocking? Not sure. Anyway, the story, editing, acting (mostly) and all other stuff sucks big-time. A lot of idling mixed with some graphic violence. If this movie is 'just a movie', with no message/moral and for entertainment purpose only, it may pass (but shorter, at a 100 to 120 minutes rate). Just as Wolfenstein game. You play it, laugh (or not) at jokes, kill everything that moves and sleep well. In all other cases, it's a waste of time and fail. So, you decide what to do with it. Mr. Waltz is excellent. Everything else - a cartoon. Not to be mixed for good taste's sake. I'm not going to watch it ever again.",5,2,4,18 April 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Finally a missing link for grownups
","Just a few statements here: This is the first episode of Star Wars I truly enjoyed watching. Putting aside usual nonsense like sound in space and laser fire visibility and sounding, this is the first intelligently written and directed Star Wars episode. Now all of the story (I mean the whole saga) makes sense and is beautifully connected. The cast is very good, and so are their performances (which I cannot say for the rest of the movies). This is also the first Star Wars movie with almost nothing stolen from already told stories like John Carter and others. No J.J. Abrams ('damn the story! just shoot and kill and destroy! and do it fast!') here and no G. Lucas ('I love fairy tales!'). Almost perfect. Too bad this was not filmed before (by the same team). And - yes: the ending of the movie is fantastic. Recommended with all my (old) heart.",9,1,2,1 April 2017
World War Z," No plants, just zombies. And not much braaaaiiiinzzzz either.
","Let's start with some obvious facts: in this (perequel?) movie you don't fight zombies with plants on your lawn. And, of course, if there was no Brad Pitt in this movie, nobody would care about it. It's simply not fun. Boring and predictable. Zombie movies are for other crew who can make it fun to watch (since the whole idea of zombies is a complete nonsense, par excellence) like George Romero (the 'father') or Jonathan king ('Black sheep') or all that stuff with the Umbrella Corporation. And some others, who understood the point and pictured it ridiculous as it in fact is. Don't get me wrong: considering the thousand times before seen 'plot', it has been correctly directed and made altogether, but what really scares me is the possible sequel (due to the inevitable cliffhanger). Don't make it, please. Let us play Plants vs. Zombies. That's what they are for. To play with and have fun. Not to make pretentious dull movies, saved only by a major star participation. 4 stars for efforts to make some sense of this script. Maybe zombie wrote it. Avoid.",4,0,1,22 November 2013
Passengers," Cheap 'love story' for older housewives
","I don't understand the good reviews here, since this movie has absolutely nothing in common with science, comedy, common sense or the art of filmmaking. Not a single part of the 'story' does hold the water here: of all the people on board (more than 5000?) only one awakes by mistake and he can't sleep back again since the ship combines incredible AI bartender with absolutely idiotic rest of the computerized systems ('I don't understand.'). Not to mention legendary rumbling sound in open space or Arcturus (cca 40 ly away) as a 'slingshot' star or choice of the other 'to be awakened' person (or the third, for that matter) and so on. Besides being an eye- candy pack of SFX and a good performance by Jennifer Lawrence, this movie is a pack of bad writing, meaningless plot and insulting viewers' intelligence. And it's not even funny. Oh, yes: there is some gardening here, like in Martian, but without potatoes. This movie cannot be recommended to anyone but inmates in some mental institution. They probably would not ask questions like 'why?!'. Avoid by all means (and then avoid some more).",2,5,12,7 January 2017
The Hunger Games," An interesting concept (divide et impera) poorly executed
","Yes, a comparison with Battle Royale is inevitable here. I guess this has been done to close the gap between two cultures (not that many people even know that B.R. even exists). It seems that the fiction in the background (did not read the book, btw.) has 'juice' but the presentation form of this movie ruined it. Strange, though. Cast is good, performances also, even the direction (mostly). But the whole picture is simply bad. Unnecessary repeating of the parts of the movie (very poorly executed 'flashabcks'), fake emotions, tons of illogical and in essence futile parts (creating some sort of dogs from nothing? Ain't that a concept from Star Trek and Holodeck with safety protocols shut down?). I could not figure out who screwed up more: writers, producers, editors, even director? Anyway, this story could have been done incomparably better in someone else's hands (say, Wheddon?, Cameron?, Scott? or anybody who knows how to make a story consistent, logical and meaningful). This way the story has no beginning and no end. Just something vague in the middle. This movie is a miss. Bigtime. Pity.",4,3,4,18 August 2012
The Irishman," Mob as a job, again
","I find nothing so special here. Just another more or less the same Mr. Scorsese movie. He did much better jobs regarding this (say, Boardwalk Empire, with much better developed characters) and this is, simply put, nothing special. Characters are again the same, story more or less also and so on. Traditional casting with good but deja vu performances, as expected from them, etc. The whole topic is a bit worn out by now, however the standards are still high. Definitely nothing for the Academy Award that should not have been given before (in general, to cast members and so on). Truly nothing special, although a good watch. But, nothing more than that.",7,1,4,17 January 2020
X-Men," Hogwarts meets Heroes
","This movie got me thinking about who is today stealing (ok, borrowing) ideas from whom and why are original movies so scarce. I really don't know (am not willing to investigate)who came up first with the idea of a 'special school for 'gifted'' and why is everybody so obsessed with supernatural powers. In today's world being simply a bit more intelligent compared to average population makes one very, very special. Of course, only a few (rich) get the chance to develop their intelligence and contribute to the 'rest of the society', basically packed with idiots. Nevertheless, the movie is pretty well done, considering 'the template'. Good directing, appropriate 'acting' (casting could be better, though, at least for the supporting roles), sfx and the rest of technical aspects. As well as the other movies in the series (2 and Last Stand), it's a good entertainment. Don't expect too much (if you do, watch the 'prequel': First Class) and have fun. It is a bit more of an experience if you watch all three in a row. Then Wolverine and finally First Class (the best of them all).",7,0,1,15 October 2011
Ready Player One," Even gamers sometimes get laid
","Well, this is not a standard Spielberg movie. Not much summoning of the emotions here. However, this is a standard high budget production (for SFX), with kids, many almost unknown actors and some 'stars'. And a lot of stuff from many other movies/games/popular culture/whatever. The only moral (or the conclusion) of the story is stated in the title of this review. Of course it is a fake hope! No such thing happens in real life. As one of the main characters says: Reality is really only thing that's real. And, also of course, this movie has almost nothing to do with the novel. You expected otherwise? If so, you're just a 10 year old kid. Smart, but naive. Movie and games are business and it's all about the money they make. Novels are somewhere on the opposite side: good for 'borrowing' ideas. As far as the acting and other 'technical stuff' (editing, photography and so on) goes, this is nothing but a standard movie made by the man who has a lot of money, influence and well crafted skill. Nothing else. Basically, empty. Even no jokes! Goes well with popcorn. A watch-and-forget kind of thing. Read the novel.",5,1,2,23 June 2018
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Too demanding movie (for an average viewer)
","Through the period of the cold war I was a kid but I do remember it and everybody knew there's something going on 'behind the curtains'. But what? This movie does not explain anything. On the contrary - it shows how entirely absurd the whole thing was. Idelogy? What ideology? They were all the same. People were spying each other, betraying, killing and so on for no real reason (maybe money, but even that is doubtful). All 'affairs' were just construction, one over the other, and all of them somewhere in the clouds. That's how I perceive this movie and the period described. Requires too much attention and background knowledge. Too much happening in too little time. One barely (if at all) distinguishes who is who in one scene, and here is already another with something totally different. Confusing and boring, yet beautifully photographed. The cast is full of 'stars' but why? None of them really has a chance to show anything impressive. There are more characters than in local phone book. Everything is sacrificed for the plot, which probably 100 people in the world understand. I'm not amongst them. The only reason I could recommend this film is testing your patience. Sorry, but nothing more than that.",4,10,19,1 February 2012
The Hateful Eight," Almost bullseye, but not quite
","Let me start with a statement: I'm not a Tarantino movies fan and in my opinion he is overrated. Some of them are quite entertaining (Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Basterdz) and some quite good (Reservoir Dogs, Django Unchained), some are boring as hell (Kill Bill, Jackie Brown) and some total waste of time (Death Proof). All of them are missing something or are overloaded. He usually has good or excellent cast giving excellent performances but what I don't like is his direction where he tends to cite (copy?) anyone and everyone. Until this one. This is a good movie but unfortunately misses an ending. It just does not last enough long (despite two and a half hours) to round or conclude the story. Maybe he is planning a sequel, but I'm reviewing this one as a 'whole'. Anyway, cast is excellent as usual and performances very good, with Ms. Jason Leigh and Mr. Goggins standing out. The story is also very good - a western crime. All very promising and enjoyable until the movie abruptly ends without conclusion. His friend, Mr. Rodriguez, is much better as a director in such 'exploitation' sub-genres (especially when Mr. Tarantino writes the story). So, watch it, enjoy and wait for the sequel (if any) to see what happened to all the characters.",7,0,9,14 January 2016
The Flowers of War," An exquisite movie
","One more masterpiece outside Hollywood. A story told like in a dream. Perfect cast (all of them, actors, as well as the technical crew). Direction from which many western 'directors' can learn (and still only dream about). However, the plot has a few minor flaws and/or omissions which get almost dissolved in the big picture. Nothing to write home about. Just remember that behind all of this are historical facts. Only man, among all the animals, can be the wildest beast and the most merciful angel. Let us be the latter.Highly recommended to everyone who appreciates exquisite film. This is the art of making movies. Enjoy it as I did.",9,3,5,19 March 2012
The Book Thief," A part of life, as described by the Death in a few words
","Reading reviews before, and watching this movie, I've decided to read the novel and forget about the movie. For me, it was just a pile of scraps from some lives put together in desperate search of a meaning. So, until I read the novel, I'll stick to the movie as it is. It is certainly not Schindler's list or La vita e bella. It does try to provoke some emotional response but fails. It's either too short or badly written and directed or both. It ends abruptly just when it becomes interesting. It deals with characters and their destinies superficially, with no explanation what, who, why, when or how. And leaves so many questions afterward. However, the cast is pretty good and Mr. Rush brilliant. But that's it. I'm especially mad at people who mix English (sometimes with an accent, sometimes plain) with German. Jesus, guys, do not take your viewers as fools. Make a movie placed in Germany either in English or German. This mixture is ridiculous. Nobady zer shpoke Inglish zet wel und srtnly not wiz Deutsches akzent. This film is not supposed to be a comedy (although the narrator, Death, tries to say: My job is dirty, but someone has to do it). And, as a matter of fact, the girl stole only one (1) book (probably that's why this is not called The Books Thief) and with no significance to the story. Final question: what did the makers of this movie try to say and to whom?",5,3,8,31 January 2014
Black Mass," Good one but a bit depressive to me
","Let's forget for a moment that this is a movie about real (and still living, at least some of them) persons and concentrate on the 'movie' part. This is one of the flick perfect for generally underestimated actors to show what they can do when given an opportunity. Depp is excellent and everything else is on a high professional level. Story is a bit depressive (and confusing at moments - apparently you cannot encompass such a complex man/story in so little given time), but I guess that's how it was, more or less. And it was a pleasant experience to see J. Depp in a such demanding role doing an excellent job (even with blue contact lens). Not DiCaprio excellent, but close. Worth a watch, but not many times.",8,0,1,16 April 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Yet another beautiful but unfinished symphony
","In a few recent years it seems that the cliffhangers came into fashion. This is, of course, just a diplomatic way to say: all kinds of authors know how to begin, but fail to finish their work. It does not mean that their work is worthless, but incomplete and therefore somehow depreciated. The usual excuse is 'I leave viewer (or reader) to come to its own conclusions', meaning 'I do not know what to do'. This also happened with this movie. Outstanding writing and performances, immersive story, brilliant direction and editing and then it abruptly ends. It left me angry and wanting more where there's nothing. I saw this with Tarantino, read in Murakami's books and so on. I still do not understand why do people start something they cannot finish and why not make it 'a nice round whole circle'. It started (and went on) with verve and ended in frustration. It just became interesting, for God's sake! However, the part that I watched (meaning the whole movie) is truly great, deserving all the credits it may get. That part I strongly recommend. Remember 'Prestige' and what it means? Well, this enchanting movie lacks one. Like a magician that disappears but does not come back for an applause. I would give it 10 stars if it only ended properly. Unfortunately, there is no end (so far). Will there be Part II? Awaiting response ..",8,1,4,8 February 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Jar Jar Abrams - the true star destroyer
","Please, actually do take into account negative reviews here, being a fan or not. Save yourself some lifetime (force?) for something useful and don't watch this. In a nutshell, this is one huge empty hollow nothing wrapped up in a such a colorful glittering paper. Take aside all the meaningless, stupid, intelligence insulting, chaotic and disconnected writing, futile forcing something into nothing, tons of money wasted on this 'science' fiction and fantasy garbage and all you have left is (considering the circumstances) not so bad directing (which is ironic, since the writer of this piece of c***p is also a director) and very (very!) good performance of Mr. Adam Driver, actor and artist par excellence, obviously fit for any kind of role. Actually, of all people involved in this, Mr. Driver is the only participant having (respectable) past and bright future in the business. There are very few and extremely rare movies that deserve either 1 (really, truly, utterly awful) or 10 (impeccable). Minus (any number) is not allowed and +5 would be too much, since Mr. Driver alone cannot compensate for all mentioned above. Therefore 3 stars. Generously.",3,33,62,26 December 2019
American Sniper," No, no, no and no.
","Essentially a correct movie (by which I mean aspects of the trade), with usual emotional Eastwood's approach barely present (or none at all) and Cooper's 'just another day on the job'. Really nothing to write home about. Maybe we're spoiled by Eastwood's previous masterpieces but this piece of American propaganda cr**p is far too much. There are so many of us on the other side of the ocean sick of 'exporting American democracy and way of life to oil rich countries' and fake heroism masked as 'world police squad'. Whatever happened to America (terrorist acts) they had it coming being arrogant and so full of themselves. No, America. You're not our raw model. I guess it's OK what you do, just do it at home. Not anywhere else. We simply do not share your enthusiasm about you.This movie could be compared to Hurt Locker in a way that Hurt Locker is waaaaay better and down-to-earth. This one is a big-time miss, despite of the pinpoint sniper precision. Not recommended, except for the American rednecks.",3,45,104,13 January 2015
Rush," Too fast to tell a story properly
","Another movie in a series I've seen lately that I didn't like. It almost looks like some trend in Hollywood movies these days: start promising an interesting story, even develop it up to a point (careful! not too deep!) and the end abruptly and leave the viewer with a bunch of question marks above the head (I believe the proper expressing for this is 'wtf?!). So, the story was promising (getting into deep dungeons of friendship/rivalry/antagonisms of main characters) but it ended up wandering around almost random scenes from their lives and ending ,as usual, just when it becomes interesting. Now something on the 'technical aspects of the craft': Cast is very good and so are the performances (two main characters only), as well as editing. The direction can be described as 'somewhat too nervous and erratic', probably following the script. There were some good ideas but, unfortunately, not developed properly. As if producers said: no money for a second more. Too bad. It could have been a really good movie. But it isn't.",6,2,8,31 January 2014
The Revenant," Superb movie movie made on a relative simple story
","Disregarding what happened during filming, the final product is superb. We've seen this story so many times in different forms, but never with such photographic beauty, masterful direction and editing and extraordinary performance of two main characters. It seem that DiCaprio excels in anything he does, and after a disaster stupidity of 'Mad Max' Tom Hardy got a chance to show what he really can do. Add to this hypnotizing music of Ryuichi Sakamoto and you have a perfect movie.I suppose DiCaprio will again lose the Oscar, taken into account his opinion on the 'members of the Academy' (yes, bunch of moldy mummies that lost the touch with common sense, taste and reality long time ago), and he deserves one for every role he's taken by now. One of the best actors ever.Extremely recommended, even if you (like me) did not like The Birdman by the same director. This one is truly a masterpiece of 7th art.",10,12,36,31 December 2015
Hugo," Unfortunately, another Scorsese's failure
","Being and admirer of Mr. Scorcese's work, I still can not explain how can he sometimes fail so badly. Among all his legendary movies, from time to time he delivers something not worth his reputation. I guess he is a better producer than a director.Hugo is a fiction tale with so many elements seen so many times before (and done better) - a 'boy-wonder', an automaton, French Policeman (Allo, Allo) and so on. Yawn. I've watched this movie until the end purely out of a courtesy for Mr. Scorcese, but this is light years away from any award (especially Academy). There is definitely something rotten in the Academy lately (probably old and nostalgic, possibly demented, people, covered with mold).Recommended for children and people who are not into movies so much to recognize all 'borrowed' elements. Light entertainment, so to say.",4,3,8,16 March 2012
Wanted," Mindless fun, again
","Fine almost all-stars cast, far fetched story, good direction, good performances (although a total overkill here), some action, and such. A popcorn & soda Sunday evening tv-movie with brain set on pause. This is one of those movies that top notch actors make just to earn some extra money 'aside'. As for Ms. Jolie, she is capable of so much more (Changeling) or less/equal (Salt, Tomb Raider). So, don't expect, just watch. You may like it or not, but you'll soon forget it.",5,0,0,17 January 2020
Ender's Game," Great novel visualization
","It's not easy to 'bring to life' something you red in a novel but apparently this movie succeeds. For someone who is not familiar with 'life and deeds' of Ender Wiggin, this movie would not make much sense. Still, it's a beautifully pictured (important) part of the Ender 'saga', that has excellent prequels and sequels (especially 'Speaker for the dead'), written by a master.So, my suggestion would be: read the novel (the whole series, as a matter of fact) on Ender and then watch this movie. Then and only then it shall be excellent to you as it was for me. Otherwise, it will just be a nice action SF, which would be pointless. Why? There are rarely movies that can picture all the layers of messages and thoughts from a story. There have been several more or worse successful attempts. This one tries to compress something that should last hours into a 100+ minute movie, extracting only the crucial point of the story. Don't miss it but, once again, read the book first.",9,1,4,24 November 2013
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," At last, a good MI
","The last movie was a disaster in any possible aspect. This one is quite the opposite. More down to earth, fun, good casting, very good direction, right pace, good sense of measure ... everything except some too obvious (a poke in the eye) sponsors. Tom Cruise gets better with every next movie he makes so one can temporary overlook his Scientology bull. I still do not understand why he had to do The Ghost Protocol, a meaningless childish showoff, or maybe that was the plan to make this movie so good. Think of it as an American James Bond (or the American answer to it), although Bond (with Mr. Craig is still much better). However, I recommend it. Just for fun, if not anything else. Good stuff this time.",8,0,5,8 October 2015
Dunkirk," CoD: Dunkirk
","Putting aside possible (or not) historic accuracies, and I guess about up to 98% of the events depicted here are imaginary, this movie a simple poetic view of the one small (but nevertheless significant) part of the WWII. Nothing more, but also nothing less. Some musicians being 30-odd years in professional business also undertake practice, and so does Mr. Nolan. This is just it. He could have made another Saving private Ryan, but he didn't. He just explored movie making possibilities combining three simultaneous 'stories' from three different points of view and, also keeping in shape. I like this movie. It's a bit unusual, personal, full of beautiful details and bits, emotional, poetic. No, not a spectacle. If you expect such a thing (with everybody shouting, shooting, running, explosions, screams and the works), forget it. However, if you're in for some delightful cinematic experience, you're welcome to watch and enjoy. Also, mind the soundtrack by Mr. Zimmer, who is not so inspired so often. And the length of the movie is just about right, maybe one shot too much (at the end), but that's a director's editing choice.",7,0,1,17 September 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Just too much
","Mild spoilers ahead:
This movie could lose some 60 minutes and nobody would notice (or probably will - it would be more fun). Some great acting wasted. Exponential comic absurdity mixed with cheap philosophy. SFX could be much better for such an epic attempt. Weepy ending with forced pathos ruins everything. I was truly glad when it finally was over. 3 stars for wrapping this up, hopefully for good.",3,101,169,18 August 2019
Alien vs. Predator," Just slightly above unbearable
","After so many years I took the effort of watching this again but the impression is still the same. PWSA is a good director of movies based on crappy writing and stupid ideas. It seems he is one of the rare actually willing to do so. No one with just a tiny bit of common sense would swallow such nonsense as this movie. I'm not talking about the general idea here. Predators hunting aliens and humans? Why not? But not with so many plot holes, undeveloped characters, bad FX, dialogues stupid beyond belief, illogicalities and all other kinds of stuff that would make Ed Wood proud. Sometimes one needs to watch such movies at least two times before forming the final opinion. Anyway: avoid, then avoid and then still avoid. It may look entertaining but it's actually insulting your intelligence.",2,1,3,13 April 2018
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Not even fun any more
","America's another futile attempt to have its own James Bond. While Bond gets better and better (with Mr. Craig), MI gets worse and worse. Just another ego-trip of Mr. Cruise. The panegyrics below seem even more insulting to the intelligence of an average viewer (not to mention more demanding ones). This serial is nothing but SFX, bad acting (although the cast is good), routine directing and childish plot desperately seeking 'missions' that are 'more impossible' than previous ones. The firs movie in the series was quite OK, but this one... Jesus! I mean, even The Saint (with Mr. Kilmer) was more watchable, and it was awfully stupid. I'm recommending this movie only if you really have nothing better to do (which I seriously doubt) and even then think twice. It is not 'light entertainment', but with absolutely no mass at all.",3,4,10,28 March 2012
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Mr. Tarantino's another ego-trip
","It seems that Mr. Tarantino has a thing for interpretation of history as he would like it happened. But it didn't. This is just another Inglorious Basterds. Start well, one expects something would happen, it doesn't and the end (for me) ruins everything. The problem with this movie is not in acting or technical aspects. There Mr. Tarantino learned some lessons being 'self-educated' as a compiler of many referential stuff seen before in classic movies. The problem is the ending. Especially when everybody knows what really had happened. Some real life character interpretations (Bruce Lee?) are even funny and maybe true, but then everything gets lost in Mr. Tarantino's fairy land. So far, the only coherent film he's done is Reservoir Dogs. Everything else is a hard-to-bear mashup of everything and nothing (especially Kill Bill), pure trash (Death Proof) or abruptly interrupted story, in which he is pretty consistent. Mr. Tarantino has potentials and talent (and Ed Wood type of enthusiasm) and original approach to matter, but definitely lacks formal education and a sense of measure. Some call it 'art'. Well, it isn't. His friend Robert Rodriguez could help him a lot (and did so far). Omitting him here again is another mistake. 4 stars for actors and scenery recreation. All in all - another waste of time on a groundless hype.",4,5,8,28 December 2019
Drive," A foofaraw movie
","Let's be a kind of brief on this one:The goods - director, photography, music. The bads - everything else but mostly script.It's a boring movie, trying to be art where there's no place for it, and mixed with so called ultra-violence (an expression from Clockwork Organge?). Good cast in the wrong movie (what is Ms. Hendricks doing here anyway?). No emotions or reason. Too slow. You wait for something to happen but it doesn't. Instead, something else happens and you're left with that 'what-was-that-all-about?!' expression on the face. At least you have an expression. Characters do not. This one should have been made with Jason Statham and called Transporter IV or something. Highly overrated movie that should very soon be either forgotten or will achieve some cult status. Recommendations? None this time. Decide for yourself.",5,3,6,20 December 2011
Frozen," Winter is coming
","Hey, guys! I've found some cool particle effects for the snow and ice here! Let's make a movie!Bad writing (confusing with no order and random scenes with no cause and effect, mixing Nordic, Russian and Dutch culture and so on). Some good music, too good for the movie. Reindeer that behaves like a dog (same approach again). Snowman that tries to be funny but fails every time. A classic Disney let's-ruin-a-potentially-good-story concept. Guys from Pixar probably went crazy. Disney studios is doing to Pixar what P.L. Travers did to Mr. Disney. For all the good moments of this movie all credits go to guys/gals from Pixar. And all the bad rest is so obviously Disney studios. Worth a look. Once. And that's it.",6,1,5,24 March 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," A very nice 'little' movie
","You may think of Ben Stiller whatever you want but he knows how to make a good, warm, touching, emotional movie, occasionally even funny. The movie is well paced and (almost - some scenes should have been cut out, like the one with Mitty becoming an 'old baby') everything is in place. Even the music. And, of course, Mr. Penn. I also would not compare this 'version' with the one filmed in 1947. They are basically two different things and each one shall have its audience but they will not mix together. You like either this one or that one. I like this one, since I got from it far too much than I've expected. A happy ending love story born in the heart of devastating capitalism (which I define as 'destroy the old, no matter the cost and how good it was and accepted by the people, and create something new - or better: contemporary - although it is usually much worse than it was. just destroy. sacrifice everything to the Profit God. who cares about the people, anyway.') This movie delivers somewhat an optimistic message. Good old stuff shall survive since it is essentially good. Most of this new stuff shall have a lifespan of a butterfly (and shall also be destroyed for something newer). Except for this movie. It will always be a classic.",8,0,2,29 January 2014
Gran Torino," Another masterpiece by Mr. Eastwood
","Since I've summarized it all in the title, what else to write? This movie, like most of other Mr. Eastwood movies, is simply perfect. Him being director, actor, composer combined with a simple yet multi layered story and excellent casting is all that takes to make a little masterpiece. Like all of his movies (well, not so much as his beginnings in spaghetti westerns and Harry Callahan stuff)are emotional with just a measure as they should be, beautifully photographed and directed, with fantastic music and actors' performances... Let's face the fact that Mr. Eastwood deserves Academy award for every movie makes. I only hope he lives long enough to bring us more of his work. Extremely recommended for true appreciation of the art of making movies by the people with refined taste.",10,0,2,7 December 2013
The Hurt Locker," An extraordinary movie
","I've read the reviews below and could not stop wondering what do people expect from a movie. Reality? Watch documentaries. Or whatever. This movie is really exceptional in many ways. Excellent acting, beautifully directed and shot, fantastic music choice and fine writing. It shows only an excerpt from a soldiers life on the job (as a contrast to life at home). It also shows how cheap and relative life can be outside our cozy little shells we build around us, and we should grab every moment given to enjoy it and do good, while we can. This is not a movie about war in Iraq or wherever. Don't be so superficial. It's only a (perfectly told, btw.) story about human adjustment to whatever life faces us with. This is a world we live in, like it or not. And this movie is just extraordinary in every aspect. Don't know (or care, for that matter) about Oscars, but this is one of the examples how movies should me made. Simple, yet with complex, with so many layers. I've watched it three times so far and each time it gets better. Highly recommended.",10,0,3,15 January 2012
Hidden Figures," This is how you tell a story, fictional or not
","This is a good movie, with a right pace, right twists at a right moment, very good direction and editing and very good cast. Music as well. I will not discuss here the factual side of the story or American racist issues for that matter. However, one thing touched my nerve as an annoying point: propaganda issue. The movie tells us that in America anyone with right abilities can succeed, being at the right place at the right time with the right skills. Now, that's smoke and mirrors. How else do you explain Trump or Bush Jr.? Putting that aside (as a possible theme for another, more critical movie), this is an excellent entertainment 'for the whole family'. It is nice to know that there, in Hollywood, still work some artists that can provoke emotions, forcing us to take sides. Good job making this movie. Highly recommended.",9,2,10,13 March 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," And then the Black Riding Hood ...
","If it were not for Adam Driver and Benicio Del Toro, as only true actor here, giving their best even for the lost cause, this would be just a correctly directed pile of trash. But not just any trash: it would be (and is) Disney trash (same as usual but pays more). In my opinion, the downfall of Disney started with incredibly stupid Lion King. After that there are no more disappointments, since you can object to anything, except for the consistency. Disney is truly dedicated to audiovisual pollution of the media space and they will continue to do crap no matter what. It is a dirty job, but someone's got to do it. Two stars for hiring above mentioned actors and their effort. No soup for anybody else involved. Run away from this and don't look back.",2,4,7,29 July 2018
Evil Dead," Do not compare, just watch.
","Although some comparisons with the original Evil Dead is inevitable, this is not 'the same' movie. Let's see the main differences: the original was funny this one isn't. Raimi's Dead had charm and has been intentionally made to be unreal in every aspect. This one brings gore to a new level, trying to convince you that it's real (and 'oh, my God, painful). After watching The Cabin in The Woods (which is funny and a masterpiece in it's own category - Joss Whedon movie) I thought there is nothing more to be done in the genre. But, there is. Campbell and Raimi are also involved in this 'remake' (intentionally in quotation marks to point out that this mainly isn't a remake :) and it shows occasionally with just a slight touch. Mr. Alvarez did not fall into a classic same- movie-larger-budget-lots-of-CGI trap. This is rather his interpretation of a classic (see Whedon) scheme but a good one (although not as good as Mr. Whedon's or Mr. Raimi's. Cast is good, camera just as it should be to avoid repeating Raimi's original approach and still remain rather suggestive. Music also. Directing and editing just right. This movie has everything for a horror lover to enjoy. So, please do :)",8,2,14,6 July 2013
The Adjustment Bureau," Watched three times already (and counting)
","It's a tough job - putting Philip K. Dick's story into a movie. Basically it's similar to Stephen King's works (Shawshank Redemption or The Green Mile). PKD's stories are diamonds in a rough, with countless layers of meaning and ideas hiding beneath the surface. Directors mostly take only his basic ideas, and try to visualize them. This movie is a very good job (as was Blade Runner, Minority Report or Screamers). Excellent casting, camera, editing, music and direction. Very entertaining, with nothing to add or discard. It radiates inspiration of the participants and it shows. There's humor, suspense, emotions and all the things that make the movie a pleasant experience, and worth watching many times. It also makes one think about everyday reality and the things we usually take for granted and 'as they are'. PKD was a genius in so many ways and I'm looking forward to the filming of all of his work. In good hands they make excellent movie, for the people who know how to appreciate a good work. Like this one.",10,0,4,5 September 2011
Prisoners," One of the best movies I've watched recently
","It is not easy to fill required ten lines of a review without revealing a bit of the mystery from a plot. So let's walk around. Almost excellent movie, a bit slow paced but it should be, due to the story developing. Good cast, excellent performances. Direction - just as it should be. Nothing to add, nothing to cut off. I would not mind if this movie lasted 5 hours (about a double as it does), revealing more details, but the director decided to leave the viewer some dots to connect. Everything else in this movie is just right. There are people in Hollywood who can still make almost perfect movies out of a very good (although rather simple) story, while not spending hundreds of millions for sfx and stuff. Leaves you with much to think about. And a delightful good movie lover experience. Go for this one. Youl'll thank me later for encouraging you.",9,2,4,18 November 2013
The Artist," Above average but still not for Oscar
","This is a good movie. The idea is not original but performance is. I must mention very skillful direction and excellent French cast (Americans here were only for marketing purposes, I presume). The story is a cliché but carried out in a perfect and original manner. Also, the movie is not completely silent (given the longest musical score ever, except for musicals, an two spoken lines at the end).I guess that this movie won an Academy award because the Academy itself is filled with old and nostalgic people (that would also explain an Oscar for 'Hugo', movie far below average, but with same nostalgic elements) who wanted to give something away before they die.Don't get me wrong here. 'The Artist' is a very good movie, and it is an European flick (a very important remark here). Hollywood has no such skill to produce it. Highly recommended.",9,2,4,16 March 2012
La La Land," Sum of correctly done parts does not make a correct movie
","Although this movie is probably about pursuing one's dreams and sacrifices (necessary?) in the process, it ended up as a lousy musical (with good music). It's also dedicated to some (golden?) era in Hollywood when musical was the best there is in the industry. So, instead of a clear emotional story of two 'star crossed lovers', we've got collision of dreams of two egoists who think their individual success is more important than than anything else. It isn't. It's just that could not reconcile one type of emotion (craving for fame) with another (love). Direction is not bad (however not as good as in Whiplash) and everything has been 'watered down' with two miscast main actors who cannot sing (and acting itself is also doubtful). Ending of the story was predictable and probably many Hollywood staff would recognize itself here. As for the musical, unfortunately I liked only 'Sweeny Todd' (meaning that it could not function in any other form). Summary: Worth a look, but soon to be forgotten (despite the hype). Four stars for cinematography.",4,5,9,2 March 2017
Super 8," A very, very good movie, as you might have expected
","Although the talent of Mr. Abrams (writer and director) is undeniable, this movie has Mr. Spielbergs's name written all over it. That simply means it's very, very good. Almost perfect. This is how movies should be done in all aspects. All the technical parts are flawless, but that's only a base of the movie, underlining it. It has everything it should have: emotions, suspense, storyline, a bit of predictability (of course :), and two happy endings. Why two? Remember to watch this movie all the way, even through the ending credits, and you'll see. And they say: never work on a movie with animals or children. Nonsense. Children actors in this one are simply perfect and outperform the majority of their 'grown up' colleagues. So, don't hesitate a bit: go for this one. I recommend it with all my heart.",9,3,4,23 August 2011
Sicario," Rarely good movie, a true pleasure to watch
","This movie reminds me of what True Detective should have been in the second season, since the first season is still unsurpassed. If this story has been converted into the second season, it would be fantastic, on the level and consistent. However, this did not happen and here we have a truly exceptional movie in its place, masterfully directed and with master performances by Benicio Del Toro and Emily Blunt, although Josh Brolin also stands out as an actor that never had the chance to realize his great potential. Until now. This is a truly dark movie that shows some real aspects of 'life on the border of Americas', where there are no advanced judgment of what's right or wrong and decisions are made on the move - the goal justifying the means. I really like this movie and recommend it to any movie/crime lover, as well as the ones disappointed by True Detective, season 2 (as I am).",10,0,3,23 December 2015
Thor," I say, old champ, jolly good show.
","When I was a kid, I was never into Thor type of comics (or any superhero, for that matter). I guess I was waiting for the movies (like Batman, Spiderman, Iron Man, Hulk and others, including this one). It is quite surprising how a teenage 'stimulus for imagination' can be turned in such fun and entertaining movies for virtually every generation, subtly avoiding the dangers of banality. Thor is almost an excellent movie: non- pretentious, well directed (good job, Mr. Branagh) and carried out in every aspect. The casting is also not bad but it really doesn't matter here. Any combination of actors could do. When you put a good story in good hands (and have a lot of money and enthusiasts to support it), nothing can go wrong. And it didn't. This is what most of the movies should be about: entertainment. Every once in a while such a bulls-eye pops out. And is very well worth watching. Can't wait for the 'part II'. Strongly recommended.",9,0,1,30 August 2011
The Departed," Extremely recommended
","Mr. Scorsese had his ups and downs throughout the career. In both cases it was somehow extreme. This one is definitely in the 'ups' and of the best he has ever made. Supported by excellent cast of peers (noone really stands out, except maybe for Jack Nicholson being over the top at moments), with fantastic cinematography and editing, Mr. Scorsese shows everybody how to tell a story. Fantastic editing and direction, with subtle messages through music and details in scenes, makes this movie one of the best ever made in the genre. Here one finds everything that makes a good old-fashioned rich movie experience: deep plot, twists and turns, tense, emotions and something I call 'unpredictable predictability' (when one knows what is going to happen but not how and when). Excellent job, everybody. Now, watch the movie and give credit where the credit is due.",9,0,1,15 June 2015
12 Years a Slave," Quite a strange mixed-up movie
","Reviewing this one is pretty much walking on thin ice. Let's start with pros: excellent cast performances (with outstanding Mr. Eijofor towards the end, Mr. Fassbender all the way, Miss Nyong'o and Mr. Dano, whose destiny is to play psychotic maniacs). Let's continue with the mediocre: direction, cinematography and editing. Now let's finish with bad: writing. The story is simply mixed up: writers could not decide what was important and what wasn't. The movie is simultaneously too long and too short. It has some unnecessarily extended scenes (probably symbolic but with no meaning in context), which should have been cut out, and lacks character developing. The final product a superficial portrait of an American antebellum era, even today looking almost as bad as the Nazism. To think that the capitalist economy has been built on theft, robbery, slavery and hypocrisy (justifying it through the Bible) and almost all the guilty got away with it! I guess that's why today white Americans are so patriotic: they not only took the land from the native inhabitants, but built their welfare on slavery and exploiting anyone who was not white (Chinese building railroads and so on). But, this film barely touches any of those problems as it should. It's just an excerpt from one man's (and his book) life. Nothing too deep or truly emotional, almost cheap like the articles in tabloids. This is not a good movie. It could be far more better but it isn't. It has moments (mainly main characters performances; therefore 6 stars) but as a whole fails to deliver an important message on humanity (as well as some political and moral messages) and be a movie that makes sense. And it seemed that director's intention has been just that. Well, he missed this time.",6,2,5,21 February 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Mission: groundhog troopers
","This movie has everything it needs to be fun, despite (I guess) everybody knowing (generally speaking) how it ends. Yes, it has something form Groundhog Day and Starship Troopers and Mission Impossible and some other movies. But it works perfectly. However, nobody should care if there is a scientific background for this. Of for some minor flaws in production. Who cares?! It's fun. And very, very well made. And even acting is good for an (essentially) action movie. Well written script + very good direction + almost perfect editing + fine SFX + very good camera work + cast obviously gave their best (even Mr. Cruise). What else do you need to watch it? A recommendation? You've just read it. Now be kind to yourself and watch this movie. It's worth it.",9,0,3,19 July 2014
Whiplash," Full metal jazz
","After all this time I've finally watched this. And yes, it reminded me of Full metal jacket, part one. I guess that Mr. Chazelle drew his inspiration from Kubrick and boy, did he make it right! Direction is perfect (including editing), fantastic performances by two main characters and fine choice of music. Beautiful photography also. This movie has everything to make it perfect, however Mr. Chazelle is not Mr. Kubrick but may probably be one day. If he tries hard enough to develop his own style. Do not give up now that you set the bar so high. All my compliments to the crew of this movie. Truly a gem. Highly recommended.",10,5,10,1 May 2016
The Wolf of Wall Street," One of the better movies I've seen lately
","There is really not much to say about this one. Di Caprio is as brilliant as expected (that man can do any job perfectly. I'd like to see him in a SF movie or a horror, just to confirm his brilliance or to find an exception.). Mr. Scorcese did a routinely extraordinary job (being, obviously, predominantly involved in Boardwalk Empire) and the rest of the cast follows correctly. Writing was also extraordinary, considering (it shows!) thin source material (book by the main character). Even the duration is not too extensive, although one could cut out, say, half an hour of irrelevant material, erratically put here and there. The greed and being eager to show off are so common characteristics of humans and ever thankful material to write (and make movies) about, although worn out. So, nothing new here. Capitalism at its worst (although, one could say, being rich and all, that it's OK). As long as there is money... (and yes: women DO fall for rich guys, disregarding everything else about them). One thing, though: too much swearing (showing uncontrolled emotions), waaaay too much.",9,0,2,28 January 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," All (first) three episodes in one and more!
","So, what did we get from Mr. Lucas here? For starters, this is by no means SF (it has fiction, although no science). It is just a soap kitschy opera consisting of bad writing, even worse directing, questionable casting and terrible acting. If you watch the Bluray version, this is even more obvious (should have stayed VHS-blurred, just to hide sloppy sfx). Expensive in making, cheap in perceiving. On the other hand, it's a fairy tale (with no moral whatsoever) for people who never grew up and would swallow anything with even a slightest SF-odor. They would never even notice (or object to) sound and smoke in open space, instantaneous audio-visual communication across parsecs, thrusters that behave like warp drive and other 'scientific' nonsense. They would just pack up with beer and popcorn, sit back, relax and enjoy. Faced with the possibility (danger?) of watching these three movies (one after another for about 6 hours), that's also what you should do. And remember to switch off all higher brain functions if you don't want to get hurt.",5,0,4,24 November 2011
Lord of War," What a good movie!
","This movie tells a story about something that everyone should think about: morality. It says that there isn't a de facto difference between illegal and immoral but law sanctions the first and life itself the second. That's not comfort, of course, but leaves a certain amount of hope.Cage , Moynahan and Leto are excellent. Hawke's part is not that big but matches the others. Directing, editing and camera also. Everything about this movie is in place and it was a pleasant and fulfilling experience to watch it. No, it is not an action movie and not meant to be 'entertaining', and it keeps you involved from the first scene to the last. Highly recommended.",9,0,0,17 September 2011
Prometheus," Beautifully photographed nonsense
","Having all the Alien films 'burdening' my back (and I still think only the first - which should also be the last as a true masterpiece and a SF par excellence - and partly Mr. Fincher's third were good, involving Dan O'Bannon as a scriptwriter in both cases), I've entered this film expecting Mr. Scott's expertise on the matter, his unique aesthetic approach and a good psychological study of humans in unusual helpless circumstances. Instead of that here we have a mess. No science whatsoever (starship rumbling in open space, hyper-advanced robot, yet C4 method of determining age and so on), no character in characters, parts almost randomly put together creating an illusion of continuity etc. It does not seem like Mr. Scott at all. More like some infantile producers with lots of money and lack of brain. And the story has such a potential. Cast is also excellent but wasted for nothing. We could get so many answers from this movie but instead we got a question - why? Five stars for camera work/photography, Mr. Scott's struggle to get something that makes sense out of this and the cast. Everything else, less than -273 degrees Celsius.",5,3,10,13 September 2012
Wonder Woman," Well ... no.
","Now, what do we have here ... Young captain Kirk as captain spy and an Israeli feast for the eyes, woman beautiful beyond belief, Ms Gadot. And, that's about it. Taking into consideration real circumstances of the WW I, incompetent and unimaginably stupid British generals (see Blackadder Goes Forth for reference) and German fanaticism, it can be quite believable that only some gods could bring that war to an end. Unfortunately, this movie does not convince or deliver (except to some 6-7 years old children, and they do not count). This movie is so childish, yet pretentious and trying to be serious, it makes one sick. Move on, people. Nothing to see here. Three stars for being mildly entertaining occasionally. And for Ms Gadot, of course.",3,2,7,17 March 2018
Taken 2," Force is still strong with this one, but not for long
","Obi Van Schindler, being a senior citizen, is still in a good shape for a 'some-secret-service-or-something' operative, and a responsible father, of course. Nobody takes his daughter and gets away with it. And our own Rade erbedija is good villain, as always (again deliberately speaking English with some foreign accent). And that's it. Movie is not that bad until a really (really!) slimy end. Recommendation: watch Taken first and this one right after, in a row. The movies (as movies) are not that bad, something happens all the time and it's basically a mindless action flick. If you don't mind repeating clichés (in this movie - about a millionth time) go for it. Direction is OK, camera good, acting appropriate. Time passes, everything is predictable and finally it ends. You take disc out of the player and forget about it. Or wait for Taken 3. And 4. And so on.",6,0,0,10 January 2013
X-Men: First Class," A very, very good movie
","When I don't press FFD button while watching, the movie must be good. When I don't pause the movie while watching, for whatever reason, it must be very good. When I recommend it, it must be excellent. This one I recommend. Perfect casting, music, camera, editing, directing, acting, you name it. It is not simple to 'swim' within the boundaries of a (so to speak) fairy tale (or fiction) and yet remain entertaining and not insulting viewers' intelligence. This movie has it all worth watching more than once. Every bit of it radiates the enthusiasm of the people involved. It provokes emotions. Definitely stands out in ordinary movie industry production. Take your time and watch it. Spend some quality time with yourself/friends. And, of course, have fun as I did.",Null,2,5,18 July 2011
Win Win," A beautiful movie
","This movie reminds people not only of how good (or bad) they can be, but also gives a lot of hope, reminding you that there's always a balance out there. As a movie, it reminds me on a fact that you do not have to have millions to make the movie great. Mr. McCarthy is in many ways like Clint Eastwood. There's a good story, master direction, perfect casting, actors that can show (an they really do) their art, excellent music and everything else that makes, in perfect balance, a funny and a heart warming film to be recommended to anyone that wants the time spending watching well worth it. Just watch this movie and you'll be glad that you did.",Null,0,1,18 August 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Simply a beautiful movie
","Well, Batman was this and that (as was James Bond) until he came to the right hands of Mr. Nolan (mr. Forster for Bond, respectively). This man knows how to make movies, even based on a trivial ground (superhero stuff and all). And this movie is beautiful: it has excellent cast, direction, writing, performances, editing, music, emotions, even length. Yup, there are two or three shots that could have been cut out but all in all Mr. Nolan and the crew did an almost perfect job. Finally Batman is a movie character worth respect (as is Bond with. Mr. Craig). After all, under all this superficial stories there are many layers to be explored and all those 'super heroes' are only (in a best sense) human. Absolutely recommended and a must for all movie lovers or just people who want intellectual (as well as visual) experience worth their time and money.",10,2,9,19 November 2012
Thor: The Dark World," Mindless entertainment at its best
","This movie is ridiculous, illogical, hollow and all that (as was the first one) but is simultaneously extremely well made, funny and entertaining. It has some better references to Star Wars (lasers, sounds), Star Trek (cloaking device) and Chronicles of Riddick (ships, SFX effects). It is all that a movie of this genre should be in the first place (and, for example, Green Lantern was not): an illusion of reality that entertains. No morals, no subtle messages. Plain simple, yet intelligent, script, fun, action (with destruction, of course), very good acting (considering the 'circumstances'; the casting was excellent), direction, editing and music. SFX is really superb and very convincing. This movie sort of sucks you in, relieving you of all the bad mood or frustrations you had before watching it. It delivers. It makes you sleep well afterward. Highly recommended for those moments when you need something to make you feel - 'this was made for me'. Now grab what you usually do before a (really) good movie and watch it. And have fun. People that made this movie did it for you, not just themselves :)",9,4,7,4 February 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Fairy tale with no fairies and no tale
","How do you call incredibly bad writing combined with even more incredible bad acting from bad cast, some light-saber forestry management, material recycling, pretty good direction and fantastic sfx? Something that is not just stupid, but Disney stupid? Yup, that's the one. This movie. I've watched the first movie in the series when I was pretty young and I though 'wow!'. Probably (only) kids would also like this one. It's simply horrible from an adult point of view. Fiction with no science. A bunch of randomly piled ideas from previous sequels put together. But not so boring. One expects something (new or at all, for that matter) to happen but it does not, and the movie is over. One gets sick from wooden figures called actors (except maybe for Chewbacca). One cannot believe that there is nothing more to say (or to tell) in this saga after the previous sequel, yet they make a movie out of it. Out of nothing, that is. If you ever were a true fan of Star Wars, forget this one for your own good. If you want to become a light-saber woodcutter , feel free to learn. My God, why did I watch this?!",2,20,29,27 March 2016
RED," Loved every second of it
","It's all in the title. Great casting (I'd especially point out Malkovich, Urban, Parker and Mirren, although everybody is good), direction, music, editing...and fun, fun, fun. For me, it is a good measure for the quality of the movie when I don't notice time passing. This is such an example. High recommendations for the ones seeking intelligent entertainment. It is quite obvious everybody had fun making this movie. I've watched it three times (with a few months in between) and every time it was the same to me, as it says in the summary - loved every second of this movie. Can't wait for the sequel, if there's going to be any.",10,1,1,29 July 2011
Godzilla," Who put God in the Godzilla?
","Summary: People do stupid things as usual and make monsters in the process. Godzilla can't stand the competition. 'Nobody but me destroys everything in the way'. There can be only one :)This is not a good movie. Last one was waaaaay better. Aside from relatively good SFX, this movie has nothing to write home about. Except for a lot of nonsense (i.e., Godzilla sometimes makes tsunami while swimming, sometimes doesn't; EMP crushes planes but not helicopters and so on). On the other hand (except for usual running between cars on a clogged street and screaming and a lot of crashed buildings, but no Al Quaeda this time), people involved in this 'project' did a fairly good job, but nothing exceptional. This movie also attempts to send some ecological message, but fails. All in all, forget about it. If you are nuts for monsters, watch previous version. Or don't. But this one is a miss huge as Godzilla.",3,1,5,27 August 2014
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Fat rebel pilot's name is Porkins
","More than 30 years and probably 10 watchings (this time blu-ray) I can say - boy, what a crap! Even three stars are too much now. I know, being much younger and all in those times this movie was like 'end of the world'. I didn't notice incredible stupidity lines (yes, Sir Alec was right; see trivia), horrible (if any at all) acting and lame sfx (some of them were quite good, though - x wings for instance). Also, if you watch this movie now after first three parts, it's even worse. 'Old friends' Obi Van and Anakin behave almost like they've never met before. Luke and Lea are twins like a kangaroo and a shark, and whatsoever have no resemblance with their parents Padme and Ani. In this 'fourth' part technology is deteriorated beyond belief (nothing to do with sfx!), as the Star Wars universe went couple of hundreds of years backwards compared to the Revenge of the Sith (episode III). The casting is also lame but was probably good for that time ('hey, guys, who wants to star in a movie and probably get paid?'). I never thought much of Mr. Lucas as a director and this movie proudly proves it. Someone (not George Lucas!) should remake the second part of the trilogy, and patch all the holes (of which many are wider than the Solar system). Try to save what could be saved and make these movies proper and balanced sequels. Kids will always buy stuff like this. It will always be a cult and a favorite fairy tale. And a soap-opera for grownups, of course. And yes: over- weighted rebel pilot's name is Porkins :) Oh, I forgot the spoilers mentioned above! Here they are: spoilers.",3,0,6,25 November 2011
50_50," What a nice movie!
","Another fine example how to make a beautiful movie on a low budget but with a good story, skillful direction and and excellent performance by Mr. Levitt (and other cast, even Mr. Rogen). Despite the rather dark theme, the movie is funny and as close to real life as it can be. Probably the most important of it all - it's optimistic. Why such almost perfect movies never even get a nomination for the Academy award? Still a mystery to me.Highly recommended to everybody, especially to those who lose hope easily. There's something funny and good in everything. Give this movie 100 minutes of your life and you'll consider it well spent.",9,1,2,28 March 2012
Deadpool," Well, I like it.
","Ryan Reynolds is a good comedian and Morena Baccarin is always one of the most beautiful women ever (unfortunately for me: both Gemini and married). The movie is simply goofy, fun, dynamic, crazy at moments, off-beat and entertaining. Full of good one-liners. Jokes really aren't as bad as some of the reviewers suggest here. If we take the whole context into the account, the highlight of this movie is not exceptional sfx, but humor. Essentially, this is a mockery, but who says superheroes cannot be fun? As many observed here, not for children (and language is a minor issue here). Still exceptionally entertaining and I watched it with many smirks on my face. Let's say: intelligently fatuous. Just the way I like it. Worth watching several times to catch all the details (yup. it's fast paced). Go for it.",9,5,15,16 April 2016
Fast Five," Mindless fun
","What can someone expect from the 5th 'sequel', after not watching first four? Probably something bad, milked to the bone and totally dry. Well, this is not the case here. I'll probably watch all the 'prequels' backwards, just for a different perspective. This movie is fun and a huge slaughterhouse for the automobiles. Reminds me of The Wild Bunch only because of the 'body count', only here 'poor' cars prevail in the pile. The movie is very watchable, dynamic, action packed and (despite many obvious flaws in the plot) just OK. In these type of films directing and editing (beside special effects) is what counts and that part of the job is well done. The only time when I actually mentioned someone 'acting' is when Dwayne Johnson pops up. That man, bearing his muscles as more of a curse in life than a blessing, is highly underestimated as an actor (watch Faster and you'll see what I mean). Others just pass through the scenes not even trying to do anything but to have fun themselves. If you have approx. 130 minutes surplus for some passive entertainment, go and watch this one. Don't expect. Just enjoy the ride.",Null,0,1,26 August 2011
Annihilation," What a bunch of Hollywood bulls**t!
","This movie is not complicated. To the contrary, it's very simple and stupid. I did not read the novel so let's concentrate on the picture. It is visually interesting but that's about it. For starters, the story (or some substitute for it) is insulting. What kind of idiot sends anybody in any kind of anomaly without a HEV suit and with M16? Here we have some lousy variance of body snatchers but without an apparent purpose. Time inside the anomaly passes slowly than outside of it, which is a nonsense per se - no pace warping or singularity that would cause this. So called scientists do not use any of their specialty for anything useful and their talk is childish. Most of the film actually nothing happens, except for one of the girls (physicist?) becomes a plant and some shots are fired into the CGI monsters. None of the characters react naturally (curious? fearful? angry? whatever?) but like dolls, and cliches are used abundantly. Really, if this movie is an allegory - what does it really show? Acting is far below any acceptable level. Never liked Ms. Portman but this is even below her 'standards'. If you wanna watch a true SF movie, meaningful and with a clever message, watch 'Arrival'. This one: skip or forget. It won't be hard in either case.",2,15,30,9 January 2019
Inside Llewyn Davis," Yawn.
","I guess everyone expects a masterpiece from Coen brothers. In most cases it is true. This one, however, is not one of such. Story (story?) is pretty weak and I guess only an orange cat stands out. The main character does not. Now, to be honest, cinematography and cast performances are extraordinary. Coen brothers know how to make a movie, even if it is back-grounded with such a shallow story (story?). To me this movie has neither a beginning nor an end. It is just an excerpt from a life of a musician (and an orange cat). Long line of brief conversations and wandering around. Depressing at its best moments. Probably this would mean something to an American who was struggling to find his/her place on the stage in the depicted period, but to majority of the audience it's simply boring. Slow paced cat movie with some singing and guitar playing. Well made, though. Someone may even call it 'artistic'. But that's it. Nothing to write home about.",5,1,3,19 February 2014
The Cabin in the Woods," Finally something intelligent and fun in the genre (coming from Hollywood)
","Well, Joss Whedon does it again. Fine cast, excellent story (the more absurd it is the better), directing, editing, music... really, you name it. Even making fun of clichés used in abundance in other horrors. I love this movie. It's quick, it's clever and it's fun (above all). Formerly, Wes Crawen was a man competent for innovations in the genre. And then came Joss Whedon. Judging by what he's done so far (both for the movies and television), he's here to stay and give intellectually a bit more demanding audience 'soul food'. Great work. Almost perfect.And there really can not be any sequel to this story. Watch and you'll know what I mean.",10,1,4,21 August 2012
Spectre," Cheesy lemonade
","I loved other Craig Bond movies (and still do - for me they are the best this franchise has to offer) but this one was completely unnecessary, except probably for the people involved in production, trying to earn some salary. It is a usual sequence of scenes: Bond does something 'spectacular', then gets beaten (and some more), then has disputes with his boss, then meets a girl, then meets the villain, gets beaten again, solves disputes with the boss and wins the day and the girl. This time, however, without humor, without convincing motivation and practically without 'gadgets' (no sponsors, huh?). Aston Martin does not count. Also, no interesting conversations, Ms. Belucci is seen only few seconds and the 'Bond girl' is 'girl next door' type. Despite good casting, despite experienced director. Bond theme is easily forgettable (yup, Adele's Skyfall was a masterpiece) as well as this movie altogether. I do not recommend it but you will watch it anyway. If no other reason, out of habit. So be it. I'm glad Mr. Craig leaves Bond. This is going nowhere.",4,6,11,8 January 2016
The Nice Guys," Pretty good movie
","Although it appears as a pilot for a TV series (since it screams for sequel(s)), this movie can remain 'as is'. It is fun to watch, most of the time something happens, some dark jokes and the 'dynamic duo'. Mr. Gosling finally shows his acting abilities (pretty good, for that matter) and Mr. Crowe' s art is not affected by aging. On the contrary. He does not have to be some Roman general to do his job with excellency. Story is a bit mumbo-jumbo, but direction is good. Also, the Australian girl (Angourie Rice) has a bright future, if she does not blow it. Yaya DaCosta is beautiful and Ms. Basinger still has it. All in all, worth your time. Go for it.",7,0,1,2 August 2018
Mad Max: Fury Road," Hollow
","This is an another perfect example of beautifully photographed and masterfully directed piece of writing garbage. Except for a nonsense far-fetched story, there is also almost no acting, no jokes and no laughs. Everything is accomplished through design, makeup, sfx and camera/direction. Good casting made no point here. Tom Hardy is not Max, especially if you remember mad Gibson. The same goes for other characters. Mr. Miller should have left the sleeping dogs lay after 30 years. This attempt to reboot fails in most aspects. No story, no emotions, no drama, no mad Max (crazy - yes, mad - no) and so on. As the title says: hollow. Worth a look, though, for comparison with previous sequels. This movie has no soul.",5,19,38,28 June 2015
Warcraft," Very good entertainment
","I've never played the game (or, for that matter, had any interest in this type of games - I'm a FPS guy) so for me there is only this movie. After forcing myself (yes, sorry) to watch it, I must say that it is a pleasant surprise. Direction is excellent and the character performances very good. Yes, this movie contains elements from many others (harry potter, avatar, star wars, stargate, LotR and so forth) but it is a well done 'compilation'and very entertaining. Of course, it could not be done with an abundance of sfx and they are up to the standards. However, the movie is not for the kids, except for those still living inside adult viewers. As I said, cannot recommend the game (still does not interest me) but as the movie - go for it and have fun. It is really good.",8,3,6,20 June 2016
Contact," Great disappointment
","After all this time I've watched this movie for the first time (and last). One would expect with such cast, Sagan as an author (which part, btw?) and Zemeckis to do a decent SF instead of a mild lukewarm lemonade. But they didn't. It's too back and white. Tom Skeritt's character is genuine asshole and got what he deserves but everything seems too fabricated and forced. There are good guys and bad guys and nothing in-between. The movie is about one hour too long, wasted on unnecessary romance (with characters having absolutely no mutual chemistry) and idle talking. Americans are standard paranoids (everyone is a potential enemy), obsessed with 'political correctness' and religious propaganda and all that crap. Too predictable and full of clichÃ©s. O, there is some science in the movie, about 1%. Actors' performances are decent, direction so-so, but the plot is (i'll be gentle) plain stupid. And I couldn't believe Mr. McConaughey took this part. Such a rare talent wasted. Ms. Foster is also good but in vain. Mr. Hurt is perfect. No, I didn't like this movie and no, I don't recommend it.",3,5,11,3 December 2014
Alien: Covenant," CPL movie, again
","Cheap, Predictable, Lame. C-movie with an A movie budget. Ridley Scott drowning more and more into dumbness with each next movie he makes. Good cast with below average acting. Mixing Star trek technology (David/Walter) with 20th century practically everything else (especially weapons). Unimaginative. Pale copy of the even paler copy. No psychology. No fear. Nothing scary (except writing - such a story shall be seriously reviewed by someone who, at least, knows how it's done). Nice visuals cannot replace the lack of common sense and dilettantism. Move along, folks. Nothing to see here. And I thought it can't get worse than Prometheus. Oh, yes, it can. Wait for the next sequel, though. There is still some space to go lower than this. I cinema theater everyone can hear you scream for your money back. Facepalm.",2,3,6,26 June 2017
The Martian," A nice light comedy
","Let me start with: this is not Gravity. Although comparable (basically one actor carries the movie, trying to survive), Gravity is much better. This one is just OK. Not better or worse than that. Matt Damon is excellent as usual (as well as Chivetel Eijofor) but there is no obvious signature for Mr. Scott here (dark atmosphere, long shots and so on). It seems he was again just doing his job with not so much personal involvement. There are also some purely scientific flaws (too much light during the 'day', for starters), but this is a movie, right? Anything passes. What this movie obviously lacks is both story and character development. Although predictable, everything happens too quickly leaving almost no space for 'digestion' or 'surprises' or explanations. It should probably last more than three hours or so. And it still would be fun to watch. Go for it, but don't ask yourself too many questions.",7,2,5,20 December 2015
The Island," Nice mixture
","Recycling time! Young padawan Obi-Van in the Dollhouse meets Logan's run Minority report. That's about it, besides good casting, decent direction and quite nice sfx. It really doesn't matter who stole the ideas from whom and what was first (and who did it better, of course). This film clearly demonstrates the ability for recycling ideas (take plot from one and produce at least three different movies from that, or vice versa), avoiding a 'remake' label. Don't get me wrong: this is an enjoyable movie, fun to watch and well made ('polished'). But nothing more than that. It will not engage your higher brain functions, but you'll be satisfied while watching, and some short period after. If that's what you're looking for, go for it. I won't mind :)",7,0,0,10 December 2011
Furious 7," Cheap and ridiculous 1
","As someone mentioned before, definitely the worst movie in the series. However, three things look promising: direction and two (maybe three or four) actors who know acting (Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham; maybe Michelle Rodriguez for a moment and Kurt Russell). Others are there just to say their lines (Diesel) with absolutely flat facial expression or to smile stupidly (late Walker) and basically just to smash as many expensive cars as possible and destroy basically everything in their way with no consequences. Oh, yes: there are many 'deep philosophical' thoughts about family, brotherhood and other cheap crap. It's not even fun any more. Reminds me of Mission impossible in a worst possible way. Well, you've probably watched first 6 sequels and you'll go for the seventh (as I did). Go then, but be warned: this movie should have not happened. Poor cars.",3,3,19,20 May 2015
