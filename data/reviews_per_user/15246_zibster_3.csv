The Rock," Great action movie
",I saw this movie in the cinemas when it first came out in 1996 and it blew me away. The plot and the action are just awesome. I love the setting inside Alcatraz and Connery and Cage put in good performances. Always good to see Connery in action movies. I think Steven Seagal and the rest of the crew on Half Past Dead need to take a look at this movie to see how an action movie based on Alcatraz should be made. Great flick. 10/10,10,3,4,12 July 2003
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Classic
","This is one of the best action movies ever made. This is the movie which started the sfx technology that we see in nearly every movie these days. It certainly was a benchmark at the time it was made and even now, the sfx are still as good as todays movies. Arnie said he was gonna be back, and he didnt lie. He came back with a bang!! I just hope T3 is as good as this one. I dont think it will be, but if its at least a tiny bit as good as this, then i'd be happy. Classic movie. 10/10",10,1,1,12 July 2003
Face_Off," Perfect action movie
","This is one of my favourite action movies. John Woo is a master and his skills are evident in this flick. Chuck in Travolta and Cage and you have one hell of a movie. The action scenes are just awesome as you would expect, and the score to this is great too. Overall, an excellent action flick. Perfect 10/10",10,1,2,12 July 2003
