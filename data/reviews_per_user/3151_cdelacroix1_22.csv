National Treasure: Book of Secrets," It's OK ... but that's about it ...
","I saw this movie this morning ... opening day here in Tulsa. And on the whole, my own reaction is that it's OK, but that's really about it.The first National Treasure flick (2004) introduced us to Ben Gates, an engaging, adventuresome treasure hunter played by Nicolas Cage. Now we have a second installment in the franchise, and Nicolas Cage returns as Ben Gates. In addition, Justin Bartha returns as comical sidekick Riley Poole, Jon Voigt returns as Patrick Gates, Ben's father; and Diane Kruger returns as Abigail Chase, Ben's romantic interest.The story line is full of archeology, history, humor, and adventure that takes our lead characters to Paris, London, Washington DC, and Mount Rushmore.All in all, this is a pattern with which many are very familiar: the pattern successfully rendered in the Indiana Jones movies.I won't give away anything except to say that I myself think that the National Treasure franchise is far less engaging than the Indiana Jones franchise. And I have to ask myself why.I think, first, that scripts written for the Indiana Jones character always seem to me to be more convincing and more engaging. This has nothing to do with historical credibility: in this National Treasure movie, and its predecessor, we in the audience are fully aware that all the 'history' in the movie is very, very unhistorical. Same for the Indiana Jones movies. However, in an Indiana Jones movie, the archaeological panoply is to me just so fascinating, and appealing, that I want it to be true even when I know it's not. And, in an Indiana Jones movie, the unfolding story is so much more fun than in a National Treasure movie. For both these reasons, in an Indiana Jones movie, I tend to take a look, roll my eyes, and then promptly suspend my disbelief and follow the storyline wherever it will lead me: it's that much fun and that attractive. Neither this National Treasure movie, nor its predecessor, lead me in this direction.As for the lead characters, Indiana Jones is so much more appealing, to me, compared to Ben Gates. Indiana Jones, in his trademark hat and bull-whip, is such a wonderful figure, played almost tongue in cheek by Harrison Ford. But the character is so much fun, like the storyline, that again, I watch Ford's Indiana Jones, roll my eyes once or twice early on, and then suspend my disbelief and follow Indiana Jones while smiling through all his fascinating adventures. In contrast, Nicolas Cage's Ben Gates is a very different character, and just has no such appeal for me. In National Treasure: Book of Secrets, we see him at one point prancing comically on a staircase in Buckingham Palace. A few moments later, we see him peeping around a bouquet of flowers at his love interest. Watching Ben Gates in these scenes felt to me like I was watching a sort of metro-sexual version of Rowan Atkinson's Mr Bean character. I just can't see such a character as a heroic treasure hunter. In contrast, Indiana Jones is every inch a treasure hunter and hero. He's also a classic masculine hero, though one who is leavened by that occasional tongue in cheek irony.About National Treasure: Book of Secrets: I did think this was better than the first National Treasure. The acting in the second movie, by everyone, was competent but unexceptional in delivering the script. The cinematography was good. Th4e dialog was sometimes entertaining. The the script overall supported a storyline, and a character, that didn't really appeal to me very much.All the same, for light adventure and light entertainment, one could do a lot worse than go to this movie.It's OK ... but that's about it, IMHO.",6,6,18,21 December 2007
The New World," The Story of Pocohontas
","I finally got around to seeing this movie and for me it was interesting in many ways but disappointing in many ways as well. Still, this movie gives both an interesting, quiet glimpse of a New World ... and uses this to deliver a deeply appealing Story of Pocahontas ... and this is the Story that really drives the movie, IMHO.I like the cinematography ... especially the very moving, very convincing initial glimpses of the New World; and almost all of the visual scenes in England.Acting is generally OK. With one important exception: Q'Orianka Kilcher as Pocohontas/Rebecca. This young lady is simply superb in my opinion. She has a wonderfully winsome quality about her, a lovely smile, and as it transpired ... to my surprise ... that this movie becomes above all *her* story ... she carries off this really very complex role with an appealingly convincing authority from start to finish. What a wonderful characterization. Many thanks, Ms. Kilcher! The depiction of the Native Americans ... innovatively styled the 'Naturals' in the movie ... is to me very appealing and interesting but also (alas) too steeped in the Noble Savage tradition for my own taste. The early Bad Europeans vs Good Natives depiction is simply unconvincing.The music at the beginning and toward the end seems to me to support the developments and mood very well indeed. However, narrative and inner voicings sometimes sound simply too loud. Some of the things said I couldn't make out; I don't know if that's just me or not ... but that happened so much that I wondered if either sound was defective, or direction perhaps erred in permitting slovenly enunciation.The script, unfortunately, seems to me very poor and very unconvincing ... there are simply an enormous number of 'holes' that kept challenging my attempt to surrender to the movie's imaginative depiction of history. The sort of Romeo & Juliet depiction of Pocohontas & John Smith is fine by me, but adding in a full scale love triangle to me needlessly complicates what is already a very full plot.The polyvocalization and the 'stream of consciousness' scene sequences in the middle do not really work very well for me at all. The slow, steady pace seems to me to drag at times. And I don't know when last I've seen a 'mainstream' movie that seemed so laconic. Plain vocal communication was amazingly sparse; too sparse.The overall contrast between the New World in America and the New World in England to me does make for a wonderful taste of one view of the history of the period. The clash of cultures and the historical setting make a truly wonderful context for this wonderful story of Kilcher/Pocohontas. Themes of individual and history, and choice and destiny, of truth and dream, are all woven into both the historical/cultural contest and the personal Story of Pocohontas in a very appealing way despite the drawbacks mentioned above.",7,3,6,7 February 2006
Hostel," Intense, Twisted Horror at its Bloodiest
","I saw this movie today, the day it opened around here, and I *really* liked it. What a wonderful kind of its genre (horror). It was bloody, edgy, intense, fast-paced, dramatic ... with a near-perfect beginning and end embracing a wonderfully terrifying story.How to compare this movie? It's very bloody, in the spirit of slasher movies beginning with the semi-legendary Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It has some of the intensely personalist flavor (ugh) of High Tension. In the tradition of American scary movies, there's sexuality mixed, in varying measure, with the fear. The sexuality is quite strong even for an R-rated horror movie. Such can certainly be titillating in scary movies; however, I myself didn't find it so in this one ... at least not after the first few scenes. In the early part of the movie especially, the general sense of Something's Not Quite Right was so pervasive, and so artfully mingled into the scenes, that I doubt if anyone will get 'turned on' by those scenes ... but expect that Something's Not Quite Right sense to coax you to the edge of your seat until the Not Quite Right hits you (and all of us in the audience) in the face.The real value of the early scenes is exactly that they follow admirably a pattern that is very familiar to horror movies fans: some likable folks (3 kids) are invited to Something That Sounds Too Good to be True. Next of course the kids experience Something of the Good. And then all hell breaks loose as they discover that it is indeed Too Good to be True. Part of the horror comes in contrasting the Dreamed of Good, the Taste of Bliss, with the actual Nightmarish Horror. There are some amazing scenes full of that intense irony that you only find in a well-made horror flick. I won't spoil them by talking about them ... except to say that these are the sorts of scenes that simply leave me wrinkling my brow and whispering 'Oh, NO ... oh, sh** ... !' If you, like me, like this kind of scene, then hey, you'll have plenty of opportunity to experience more than a few such in this movie.The entire movie is set near Bratislava, Slovakia, and there are some lovely views, beautiful scenes, mostly of what Americans (like me) would think of as a quiet, almost idyllic, sometimes pastorally peaceful setting. Which produces all the more contrast to the horror of the film.The pace was good, the action was quick, the dialog and script were both economical and very credible. Tight, taut, scary, horrifying ... if that's your scary movie taste, hey, check this movie out.",8,11,20,6 January 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Narnian Delights
","I just saw the movie 'Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' tonite. This is actually the third time I've seen it since it opened last weekend. I just thought this was superb.Full disclosure first though: I've been a 'fan' & admirer of C.S. Lewis for many years; and have read the whole Chronicles of Narnia many, many times. For those who don't know what the Chronicles of Narnia are: these are a collection of 7 children's books written by Lewis. Yes, children's books. And I'm 51 years old. And I love them. So what already ... ? ;- )Anyway, I was already 'biased in favor' when I saw the movie for the first time. But when I saw it I really had no idea how much it would pluck at my heart strings with so many themes like Desire, and Longing, Longing, and more Longing; for the Coming of Justice and Right. This movie was released during Advent Season: a few weeks before Christmas. Perfect timing given the themes.The little girl who plays Lucy in this movie is just absolutely enchanting. And if you're like me and feel like you know Lucy ... and Peter and Susan and Edmund ... from the full Narnia series ... then you'll remember just how very, very special this little girl is in that series. This little girl Lucy in the movie really opens wide her child's eyes and my eyes looking at her eyes and her face. Her response and reaction to, well, everything, was so appealing that to me this little girl made every scene that she was in. And that's almost every scene of the movie.All four of the children, though, were very well played by this young cast. Again, I almost feel I know these children from the books: and they come across with all the individuality and complementarity that they do in the books. Character development is an interesting feature of this movie. Edmund's development is by far most profound; well acted, well scripted, satisfying. Peter has a strong character development as well. Susan has some character development. Lucy ... as far as I can see ... exhibits no character development at all ... and this is wholly welcome: one simply wants Lucy to change in no way at all!Relationships ... among the four children; between the children and the Great Lion, Aslan; between the Children and the Narnians; were modulated in an ongoing appealing manner that was both complex and straightforward. Speaking of the Narnians: McAvoy's Tumnus was perfect; Tilda Swinson's White Witch was simply perfect as well; the Beavers were wonderfully appealing and convincing. The Centaurs and Minotaurs and Wolves and Ogres were wonderful. The manner in which Dryads were depicted was quite imaginative and a successful adaptation from the books. The scenery was beautiful, delightful ... and the music, which I thought at first I wouldn't like, actually turned out to be a wonderfully lush, well-integrated feature of the whole film.Comparisons with The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter movies are inevitable. I very much have enjoyed these series as well. And frankly I think all three contributions to this common imaginative/fantastic genre have unique features to commend them to us. I think other than that I'll pass on comparisons for the moment except to say: if you liked one of the three, you may find that, like me, you'll like all three.Just a delightful, wonderful movie ... And just as LOTR and Harry Potter have developed multiple movie installments, I very much hope that cinematic celebration of the Narnian Chronicles continue!",10,0,0,14 December 2005
Brokeback Mountain," How Not to Tell A Tragic Love Story
","Heath Ledger is just extraordinary as Ennis. He carried this role with such skill and authenticity. I really think he's one of those gifted actors who can truly act almost any part he's given. Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack is good. So are Anne Hathaway as Jack's wife Lureen, and Michelle Williams, as Jake's wife Alma.I really like the cinematography. There are breathtaking big sky scenes, with a movingly austere beauty. Country and small-town scenes are exquisitely composed and depicted as well. Night scenes are delightful.My main disappointment is with the story, or the script, itself. And the script is so inadequate that to me it overwhelms the movie's remaining strong features.I have not read Annie Proulx's short story. But the story in the movie version is primarily, IMHO, a Love Story. A Love Story of a special kind: Tragic Forbidden Love. This kind of Love Story takes deft handling to bring it off; and it just plain doesn't work for me in this movie.Compare other well known Forbidden Love Stories: Romeo & Juliet, Lancelot & Guinevere, Tristan & Isolde; Nabokov's Lolita. A modern movie version of Tristan and Isolde is in movie theatres at the same time as Brokeback Mountain, and they really make an interesting contrast. More on that later.Surely what is in common in all these tales is that as long as the Love Story is borne in Fantasy, it carries all kinds of special features that we attach to the Special (if Fantastic) World of Love. The Forbidden Love is carefully cultivated, with plenty of hints, suggestions and flirtations between Lovers. Then Love encounters Reality: and Tragedy results. In each case, we feel the Love very acutely; and we feel the Tragedy very acutely.Compare Brokeback Mountain. Almost nothing prepares us for the initial sexual encounter. When it does happen, we have these two men, who have almost no connection, proceed post-haste to kissing and anal sex. This is perhaps credible for Jack: the implication is that he's experienced in this area. But Ennis ... ? Ennis who, as a child, was shown a man's dead body, brutally murdered for engaging in this kind of sex? There could be some development to get Ennis from that kind of past to anal sex with Jack in the present. But there's no hint of this in the script.Likewise, we see Ennis and Jack becoming friends *after* having sex. I guess this is consistent with the modern myth of how intimate relationships develop. And in terms of (say) Fantasy, that sequence can certainly work in a movie. But again, in terms of the real-life context of a 'realistically' styled movie, the sequence to me is very unconvincing, unless there is some kind of development. It's not in the script, though.The triangulating couples ... Jack & Ennis, and Jack & Lureen, and Ennis & Alma ... are unconvincing to me in many respects.For example, we have Ennis & Alma waiting for Jack to come to town the first time: then Ennis and Jack start making out in front of the building, in the street, within easy view. What Forbidden Love Story has the Forbidden Love so much in the open? And remember, this is supposed to be 1960s Wyoming; and Ennis is supposed to have deeply etched memories of what can happen to a man who does things with another man. And yet it is *Ennis* who grabs Jake, ignores the public place, and starts making out.Then Alma sees them making out. Alma's face looks almost comically nonreactive. The audience I was in laughed. Then we see Alma's face in painful shock. The audience was then silent. This sets up an amazing pattern for the rest of the movie: the Forbidden Love's consequence to Someone Else is shown, but is first undermined by humor. We are allowed brief glimpses of each wife's pain, but always it's preceded by humor that (I suppose) is intended to minimize the pain for the audience. Contrast Tristan & Isault. The dark side of Forbidden Love ... Treachery, Pain and Suffering ... is shown full force. It's part of what makes Tragic Love so Tragic.Alma never questions Ennis about his infidelity, until long after their divorce. The eventual confrontation dialog implies she's just figuring out that the fishing trips aren't fishing trips. How is this credible? She knew from day one. Both wives are depicted as a cross between the comical and the sad. Other than that, we aren't given enough insight into them to really sympathize. Similarly, all scenes with the children show them as happily oblivious to what's going on. Indeed, if there's any indication that the children, or their parents, are aware that the Forbidden Love might be causing any kind of problems for the children, I missed it. Except, indeed, for some additional odd use of misplaced, scornful, humor.Some symbolism was heavy-handed. For example, the early scenes with Jack and Ennis amid a sea of white sheep, followed by later scenes in which the wives are depicted with white light engulfing them from time to time seemed calculated to help us view their marriages as full of sterile, boring sameness. Contrast the far richer, deeper relationships in Tristan and Isolde.Don't get me wrong: there are wonderful, touching scenes. Many between Jack and Ennis; and a couple of lovely scenes between Ennis and his daughter; and a few others. A good Forbidden Love Story has a lot to commend itself from my angle. Some of the statements ... 'We're stuck' 'It could be better' 'It could be more' ... have wonderful evocations of the Love Story tradition of Longing and Hope and Desire that can be challenging and complex and deeply moving ... in a well told Love Story, that is. However, in this movie, the storyline and script consistencies overwhelm the unfolding of the Story.",5,11,37,15 January 2006
Juno," A Female Napoleon Dynamite
","I saw this movie today, and found a sort of coming-of-age tale told with a large dose of campy humor. I thought this movie was on the whole a good movie, though not the stand-out dark comedy/drama that it's reported to be.The movie focuses on a vivid 16 y.o. pregnant teen named Juno, who is in so many ways a female version of Napoleon Dynamite. If you liked Napoleon Dynamite, you'll very probably like Juno; if you didn't like Napoleon Dynamite, you'll probably be well advised to pass on Juno.I myself liked Napoleon Dynamite ... although the constant sardonic humor and uber-Attitude becomes rather trying, both in Juno and in Napoleon Dynamite, the whole does kind of grow on me ... as on others. This is the kind of character that I myself find fun, if cloying. I don't myself enjoy sardonic put-downs as a part of my regular diet. One viewing is enough for me. But that's me; to each his/her own.The storyline I thought was very engaging, and the supporting script conveys it well. The acting ranged from solid to excellent. Ellen Page as Juno is perfectly cast and delivers her character perfectly. Michael Cera did a solid job as Paulie Bleeker. Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, Allison Janney, and J.K. Simmons all turned in decent supporting roles. Cinematography, sets, sound were all good.All in all, if you like teenage coming-of-age flicks in general, and Napoleon Dynamite in particular, this movie is for you.",7,2,10,28 December 2007
Match Point," Wonderful Work, Mr. Allen!
","This is a marvelous tale, of fate and luck, of love and ambition. A tale very well told indeed.Though set in London, the culture depicted seems to draw all its strength from Woody Allen's Manhattan. We have a rootless zeitgeist combined with a contrasting and singular rootedness in The City. That's the world of Woody Allen whether set on one side of the Atlantic or the other. This special world seems to be the one he was born to describe. The literary, articulate, smooth, urbane, well-to-do Manhattanite aristocracy of art and manners is a culture that, whether it actually exists or no, is a world that surely deserves its place in fiction. Some might find such a world viscerally unappealing. Yet the depiction of a world so cosmopolitan, urbane, smooth, well-to-do, and amoral (Dennis King's term in his review of Match Point; and he's right) is a pleasure to behold. The first half of Match Point establishes this world, in a slow, desultory manner. After a first few minutes among this well-to-do slice of London's best and brightest, surely the natural reaction is that we've stumbled into a boring soap opera. Suddenly, though, the pace, and my adrenalin, leap upward: for here is this banal Chris groping in a gun cabinet for a skeet shotgun ... and the thought suddenly dawns, 'My God he's going to kill her!' Suddenly I feel myself plunged into an action thriller, the last thing I was expecting from this cool, quiet movie. Yet once in progress, all seemed so authentic, so natural. For the rest of the picture, I was on the edge of my seat. And from audience reaction, I wasn't the only one. The pace picked up but remained curiously restrained  and suspense and story unfolded perfectly.The acting and characterizations were wonderful. Jonathon Rhys Meyers as Chris brings this strangely disturbed and disturbing character to vivid life. Matthew Goode as the cool, witty Tom is excellent. Brian Cox surprised me in an appealing turn as Tom's father Alec. Penelope Wilton as Tom's mother Eleanor does fine work. Emily Mortimer as Chloe, Tom's sister and Chris's wife is very convincing indeed. But by far the best work is done by Scarlet Johansson as Nola. What a wonderful actress: here in a very different characterization from her excellent work in Ghost World, Lost in Translation, and Girl with a Pearl Earring. Johannson's Nola is sexy with a tough edge barely covering her underlying vulnerability. Nola is by turns a seductress, 'damaged goods' with an identity subsumed within her sexuality and at the same time uncomfortably aware of how limited that identification is. Nola's ability to convey simultaneous responsiveness to Chris' inappropriate advances, while mixing her response so variously, adds such depth to her character. So, when Chris first meets Nola, we see sparks with Nola assuming a clearly accustomed role of Dangerous Flirtatiousness. Then, in the bar after her failed audition, when Chris is pressing her again, she fails eye contact and both ignores and fails to ignore his verbal advances ... as if trying while inevitably knowing that she will fail, to resist. Then when she is fleeing in the rain and Chris catches up with her and she quickly succumbs to his advances, we see her in what we feel is also a very accustomed role: Hurt Vulnerability Succumbing to a (False) Male Rescuer's sexual advances. All of this is very convincing ... and tragic ... and perhaps establishes the only faint foreshadowing of the ultimate tragedy of her murder by Chris. The interior dialog, expressed hallucinatorily, of Chris with the dead Nola and her dead neighbor, feels strange at first ... and then, again, strangely authentic. As if the things taking place inside of Chris had an objective reality that could not be suppressed by the random success of events in progress. Yet the prediction of Nola ... that he would fail ... proves wrong. By chance: again and again the beginning theme ... of Match Point ... that luck has such an important place in things ... was borne out again and again. Another set of dialogs ... that of the police ... comprised the first (I think?) away from Chris ... and added a polyvocal feature that was a real stunner ... yet works well for me. There's a dialog between Chris and his old tennis buddy in which he's contemplating leaving Chloe for Nola. I couldn't help but think of a similar dialog: in The Family Man, when the Cage character is considering cheating on his wife. The reactions of Cage's friend, and Chris's friend, were enormously different. And seem to reflect a strong contrast between the self-absorbed values of urbane well-to-do class yuppies in London (or Manhattan) and the middle American family values of the Family Man. Interesting contrast.In any event, the double-murder by Chris does not, on the surface, seem to disturb his world. Indeed, it protects it. Which is his intention. Whether by intent, or by sheer luck, or both, though, we find that Chris and Chloe are together, have a child and all seems to be proceeding swimmingly for the family by the end of the movie. What will happen next? Who knows? Chris may be able, as he said to Nola, to simply sweep all the guilt under the rug and go on. As in Hamlet, there is no reason that the central treachery should ever be discovered. Yet is this what we can expect from Chris? For he is still Chris. He is the man who did these terrible things; whose character flaws (if we can so style them) led him to the final 'fatal necessity' of a double murder. If this is so, then one suspects that something like will happen again. This time, the luck of the tennis ball may go the other direction. Who can say?",8,4,7,29 January 2006
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Disappointing Musical
","I saw this movie today and had a generally mixed reaction. It's basically 'OK' but the storyline doesn't really to me provide enough interest to sustain a full length motion picture. Also, although any new musical production is to me a cause for celebration, this one just doesn't come near to matching other modern musicals in quality or appeal.Music and songs naturally make for a big part of the appeal of any musical like this. And I am simply delighted that the movie musical has gained something of a revival within the past half decade or so. However, with some exceptions, I just didn't really enjoy the music and songs  not nearly as much, anyway, as in other modern musicals, like Moulin Rouge, Phantom of the Opera, Chicago and Rent.Casting and acting seem to me to be very solid throughout this movie, with two exceptions. One is Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs Lovett. Carter was perfectly cast and I thought gave a wonderful, exceptionally strong performance. On the other hand, I really thought Jamie Campbell Bower was either unconvincingly cast as Anthony, or was given a scripting for Anthony that was unconvincing. Johanna after all finds her heart captured by an Anthony who is supposed to be a handsome, romantic man she sees from a window  and whose chief distinguishing features appear to be androgyny. I can believe in love-at-first-sight for a 'manly' man; or in love-at-first-sight for a male lead known as a 'heart-throb'; or in love-at-second-sight for a 'metrosexual' man whose character or personality, captures the heart of a lovely lady. But Johanna has only brief glimpses of Anthony in the street. She has no 'manly looks' to go on; she has no special 'Errol Flynn' appeals to go on; she has never met him, so can't fall in love based on his 'personality'. All in all, the response of Johanna to this Anthony is just not convincing in a musical like this.The script contained other problems that to me undermined the storyline by giving us events that didn't seem consistent or credible. The movie is not in a 'realist' genre, so I'm not at all interested in every little detail being somehow 'credible'. However, even in a musical, I need at least enough a to help me to a 'suspension of disbelief'; and at minimum, obviously inconsistent details don't need to be flaunted in my face. Alas, the script did exactly that every now and then. For example, early on, a charlatan is selling a 'miraculous elixir' said to promote a lush head of hair. Sweeney challenges him to a contest in which he and the charlatan are both to give the fastest, cleanest shave. Up till that point, there's no slightest indication that the peddler is also a barber. And there's not the least excuse offered for a face-off in which facility in shaving is supposed to establish credibility, or lack thereof, for an elixir promoting fast hair growth elixir. Similarly, there's a point at which Sweeney's daughter tosses a key out a window to a stranger she's never met. Things like that leave me scratching my head, and it's hard to 'buy into' a story I'm constantly scratching my heard over.I did like some things: the sheer darkness of the conception, and of the settings, and of the humor  these things I really enjoyed. The 'life at the beach' sequence was a funny and light-hearted sequence that provided a welcome parody of Sweeney's perpetual gravity.All in all, although Sweeney Todd is to me 'OK', on the whole it just doesn't make for a good musical.",6,3,8,25 December 2007
The Hills Have Eyes," Desert Mutant Horror
","I just saw this movie today ... and it was really a fantastically good scary movie.I haven't seen the Wes Craven version, but did read a movie review from yesterday (when it opened here) and it didn't begin to do the movie justice. The review then ... and several others I've seen since I got on IMDb tonite ... really emphasized blood and gore.Well, there was plenty of blood, to be sure, but that really wasn't the driving horror of the movie. Fear of bloody death, plus mutants, plus barren desert isolation, plus an overall feeling of desolation and decay and dessication ... that's what really makes this a truly scary flick.The cinematography was excellent, the use of darkness and glaring desert light, the washed out colors, the really wonderfully scary use of sound and music ... all worked together in the spirit of horror, horror, horror.There was really plenty of artful misdirection and surprise and sort of moody unease much more like some of the unbloodier horror movies and the mix of the two very different approaches to horror to me work very, very well.The scenes in the town were absolutely terrifying and horrifying throughout. I won't say anything else about that because I don't want to give anything away; but do want to say that the historical tie-in led me to do a Google search on that town, and sure enough, there was such a place. Whew! The acting and characterizations were entirely adequate to the purposes of the movie and the ending was satisfying.All in all just a wonderfully scary, scary, horrifying adventure. Check it out!",8,0,0,11 March 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," There's Something About This Movie
","This was an enormously funny romp of a movie. It has been compared frequently 'The Wedding Crashers'. And mostly this movie seems to be liked better than 'The Wedding Crashers.' I see the comparison, but honestly think 'The Wedding Crashers' was sharper, funnier, faster. As for '40 Year Old Virgin,' think this movie may be much more comparable to 'There's Something About Mary'.Having said all that, this was truly a hilarious movie about (of course) Sex. There were several parts that were especially funny to me. The chest-hair waxing scene. The 'I know you're gay because ' dialog. The conversation(s) in the bookstore. The scene with the condoms.The ending of the movie was really perfect, perfectly funny and perfectly high-spirited.Regarding acting and characterizations, frankly, I did not like Steve Carell as Andy. I guess in a way it might seem like an easy part to play, but who really could have pulled it off? Not Carell in my humble opinion. Catherine Keener as Trish was excellent, on the other hand. Then again, Catherine Keener is always excellent. Paul Rudd as the morose stoner was not to me very appealing. Romany Malco as Jay was very good. Elizabeth Banks was hot. HOWEVER ...Seth Rogan as Cal was by far the best in the movie! I really thought Rogan's Cal carried every scene he was in. Yet he never over-reached, never played too far or too fast or too anything. Who is this guy? Blue collar, tattooed, crude, funny, natural, relaxed, playing his part with a cool, confident style that simply never faltered. I see he co-produced the movie. Clearly he had a lot of confidence in the product as well. I really hope to see more of this talent.",7,0,3,20 August 2005
She's the Man," First Rate Teen Flick
","I saw this movie today (opened yesterday here) and was simply delighted.I saw a review that said something to the effect that the reviewer thought this would be just another teen movie, but then found it was based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night ... and then started trying to justify liking this flick on Shakespearean grounds. I really think this is going way overboard: the only connections I could see with Twelfth Night are (a) the basic conceit of a girl masquerading as a man; (b) the extensive male-female humor arising out of that basic conceit; and (c) some of the names (including Viola & Duke).Aside from those names, the thematic commonalties (a & b) are really great themes for any script, and this movie's script is no exception. Beyond that, though, this really is a simply delightful and very contemporary/traditional teen flick. And that's a perfectly legit genre even if highbrows have to find an excuse to like it ... like alluding to Shakespeare.The movie is bright, fast-paced, emotive, stylized, funny ... full of teen hormones and teen humor and male/female humor suitable for all ages. And that's really the best part IMHO: really just about every male stereotype and every female stereotype is depicted in roundly appealing over-the-top fun. Those stereotypes are parodied relentlessly but affectionately, with such a complexity of invention that I'm still a little bewildered ... but really don't feel at all disappointed in that regard, it's not that kind of a movie: things come at you fast and fun and you get a laugh and a groan and then move on to the next split-second happening.Amanda Bynes really is just delightful as Viola / Sebastian; Channing Tatum makes a wonderful Duke; David Cross does a wonderfully over the top Principal Gold.

I Am Legend," Gut-wrenching movie full of adventure and heart
","I just saw this movie today, the day it opened here. And was deeply, deeply moved.I've got to start with the scenes of a deserted New York City post-apocalypse. These were so very, very moving; and very, very convincing. The clips in the trailers for the movie were good, but you really have to see the full panoply of close-up shots, distance shots, etc to really appreciate the sheer scale of what this movie is depicting. There's something of On the Beach and Resident Evil and of any number of disaster movies and zombie movies here. But none of them do justice to the New York depicted here. This is a New York City we see large-scale and micro-scale in order to show us the environment in which the main character is acting.And Will Smith is simply brilliant as the sole survivor, Robert Neville. Will delivers movingly and convincingly on a script that really focuses on giving us a picture of 'what it would be like' ... to be the last man on earth, living off the land in NYC. This is the real strength of this movie: there's really not a lot of blood or gore or zombie scenes at all. Yet I was riveted as Robert goes through his 'typical days' in NYC. Every moment was full of pathos and full of menace, too. And occasionally we got some relief from Smith's trademark humor that blended seamlessly with the rest of his performance to give us 'what it would be like' with a powerful delivery that just leaves me almost breathless.There's an effective use of flashbacks that partly tell us the story of how we got to where we're at in this grim New York City; and the flashbacks also serve to give us an overwhelming contrast between Life Before and Life After the apocalyptic disaster wiped out the city. Yet use of flashback was sparing, which I found all the more effective.Cinematography was excellent throughout, the storyline and script are brilliant, the use of a dog, Samantha, as a key actor was perfect to show us both Robert as companion and Robert as lonely, isolated survivor.I won't give away the ending, but think it was satisfying as far as it goes, but not nearly as appealing, from my angle, as the foregoing material. That brings up my one complaint: the title. By the end of the movie, we have some sense of the meaning of the title. Yet it still seems to me to feel cheesy and really unworthy of the movie.But that's a minor plaint. If you haven't seen this movie, and would enjoy seeing a really powerful story about a survivor in post-apocalypse New York City, hey, go check out this flick. It's really worth it.",8,629,1019,14 December 2007
The Great Raid," What a Great Story
","If you want a great *Story* check this movie out. To me the the most appealing feature of a strong historical film is the Story within the Great Story that is the historical setting: in this case, WWII. The Story of the Raid, the Love Story (I very much agree, Nielsen is excellent!), the Comradeship Stories both within the Camp and within the Raiding party, are to me painted vividly and appealingly. The weaving of these Stories leading up to that last action-packed half hour ... the Raid Story Proper ... worked well for me. I mean, from the very beginning, we know there's going to be a Raid, and it's a helluva thing to anticipate. And here we are building up to it and building up to it through these interwoven Stories ... and by the time the Raid itself blazes onto the screen, I think both my emotions and my anxiety had been plowed and sown and grown to an acute point that plain old blew me away when It Finally Happened. On a different note: I very much liked the cinematography. The colors, ranging from dry browns to burnished golds to field grays to dull greens, were to me very, very evocative, and gave the whole movie a flavor that fit the Stories very well indeed. Something especially about some of those scenes that were colored somewhere between those old time brown-and-white photos and modern tints and colors ... well, they were to me just wonderful. The device of starting the movie with B&W and closing it with B&W is sort of an old device now, but works very well indeed for me. One more thing: I very much like the emotions of this movie. WWII movies following Saving Private Ryan seem to echo some of the early post-war flicks in combining lots of Action with lots of Emotion of a very basic sort: Horror (at Atrocity), Anger, Comeraderie, Love (of Man & Woman), Patriotism, Hope, Fear, Anxiety, Anticipation, Excitement, Longing ... especially Longing for Doing Things that Matter. These are the kinds of feelings I expect to find in good Stories within Great Stories of War and History. If you do as well, check out this movie: you won't be disappointed.",7,4,9,6 August 2005
Inside Man," Decent Crime Thriller
","I saw this movie yesterday, the day it opened here in Tulsa. And on the whole I liked it.But to be honest I'm not entirely sure why.I know most of the critics reviews have been very positive. But the plot and script were really rife with holes; acting was decent but not really stand-out work; flashback and flash-forwards didn't really work all that well from my angle. It even felt a little long to me.And yet ... do you ever see a movie that seems to have a lot of faults and yet the composite is so much better than the sum of its parts that it works anyway? That's this movie. The pace was good, the sense of drama was non-stop, the occasional humor worked, the action was fast-paced, the headlining cast was superb and turned in perfectly creditable performances.All in all a good crime thriller flick. Hey. Works for me!",7,2,3,25 March 2006
There Will Be Blood," Great sets, good cinematography, lousy story.
","I just saw this movie today ... 'Whoa yeah ... finally!' I thought when I saw it in the movie listings here. It was released here yesterday ... about a month after it had hit wide release, I think. By now there have been so many positive reviews ... and I liked the trailer ... so I was looking forward to seeing this movie very much. Unfortunately, it really didn't live up to expectations.First, though, the good things. I really liked the sets and scenery and cinematography. The good folks in charge of such things really seem to have worked hard to give us a vivid, convincing vision of period oil and period settings for oil production and life in a dry, arid land in the period West.The acting performances ranged from very good to excellent throughout. Daniel Day Lewis did a wonderful job giving us as convincing a depiction of Daniel Plainview as I for one can imagine.Having said that, though, Daniel Plainview as a character came across to me as affected, posturing, and very unconvincing. For that matter, most of the characters in this movie were to me unconvincing. And the script that gave them birth was to me generally very, very unconvincing. The action was slow, even boring, without being redeemed by any kind of realistic character development or story development. I honestly thought about walking out a few times, but persevered until the bitter end ... and ended up just shaking my head at a final scene that was to me just utterly incredible.My own view of almost any movie that professes a realistic historical setting is that there are two major pitfalls to avoid: (1) treating a historical period as if it's a reflection of our own time: 'just like us'. And (2) treating a historical period as if it's a caricature, almost the opposite of our time: 'nothing like us.' There Will Be Blood makes the second mistake,IMHO.A movie about a bygone world that's really just a caricature, seen through eyes that don't have any sympathy for another time and another place, is an expression of what has sometimes been called 'chronological snobbery': the idea that just because people and place belong to the past, they must be brutal or inhuman or idiotic or venal far beyond what we know in our own here-and-now.So in this movie everyone seems driven by brutality and greed and inhumanity and sheer stupidity far beyond what we would regard as credible in our times, but apparently we're supposed to buy this kind of vision about the past. Why? Because ... 'they lived back then' while 'we live now' as if that's some kind of automatic reason to embrace a dehumanized view of people who lived and moved on this old world before we were born.So we have a movie full of people who are all ... meaning, all, with (perhaps) one exception that I can think of ... driven, uncaring, brutal, greedy ... and too stupid to get out of the way of obvious dangers although somehow they've managed to survive, for years and years, in a dangerous, inhospitable environment. Not to give away anything, but the final scene gives examples of all of these incredibilities (if that's the word) in an especially unrealistic vision that (I guess) must be the scriptwriter's idea of how things were back in the early part of the century. Yet anyone with any actual knowledge of the period ... or with any actual knowledge of people in general ... would consider this to make no sense at all.Don't get me wrong ... a bleak, Hollywood-type nihilism may not be appealing ... not to me anyway ... but it can at least be rendered realistically and convincingly. See for example No Country for Old Men ... another 2007 film that in some ways has the same 'flavor' as There Will Be Blood.But No Country for Old Men gives us a well-scripted story with a strong, convincing plot. There Will Be Blood, in contrast, unfortunately serves up a script that is unconvincing, unrealistic, incredible, ahistorical, and boring.Charles Delacroix",5,31,61,26 January 2008
Lord of War," Lord of War is Just Plain Wonderful!
","I just saw this movie tonite ... 9/16, opening night in my area. And I thought it was just wonderful, from one end to the other. Lots of action, lots of irony, lots of humanity, lots of darkness ... for this is really a 'Neo-Noir' film. And if you don't like Noir, you might want to pass on this film. But if you *do* like Noir ... I sure do ... this is just a wonderful, wonderful movie.The plot could be summarized as sort of a 'life and times of an international weapons dealer / gun runner.' If that sounds like it makes for fast-paced action, it definitely does.The opening scene ... with Nicholas Cage the weapons merchant standing amid thousands and thousands of spent casings littering the ground in a civil war scene ... is gripping. It's also a perfect segue into the opening sequence: tracing a single bullet from manufacture through distribution to deadly use in a street battle. This opening sequence seems to very effectively set the mood and the theme for the entire movie.Nicholas Cage as Yuri Orlov is perfect as the very damaged merchant of death ... cool, cynical, ironic, engaging. This is a type of role that Cage has already given us, very successfully, so many times before, in Snake Eyes, in 8 MM, and more. He brings to this particular role a crisp energy and professionalism that are simply flawless. His ongoing soliloquy-like monologue is classic Noir ... in the very best sense ... and matches the pace of the film perfectly.Jared Leto as Yuri's brother, Vitaly, is excellent throughout, in a role that doesn't get a lot of screen time, but which involves an amazing series of personas that Leto enacts with a compelling reliability that is entirely credible throughout.Bridget Moynahan as Ava, Yuri's wife, is very fine in a role that naturally reminds one of The Godfather's wife; but which is fresh and believable at every moment in her rendition of this appealing and tragic character.Ethan Hawke as the Interpol (?) agent turns in a solid performance in a role that had weight throughout although we actually see very little of this character on screen. The final confrontation between him and the Cage character shows Hawke at his best, and is a very convincing foil indeed in this setting.The remaining cast are quite simply excellent as well, providing a wonderful array of fascinating yet ultimately tragic figures.The cinematography is excellent as well, and some of the visual sequences are superb: as in the back-and-forth camera action on Yuri's son and his mother and Yuri's 'base' hideout. Similar scenes set in Africa are particularly effective as well.There's an interesting sort of historical device that we saw first in modern times with Forrest Gump. The entire story is stepped through the years from pre-Glasnost to 'today' with historical allusion after historical allusion. We see depictions of Gorbachev, of Reagan, and of more chronicling the years from the 1980s thru 2001. The scene of Yuri sitting on a fallen statue of Lenin while doing business is one of many that will both please and tug at the heartstrings.All in all, a fine movie, by a fine cast, with a great action pace, a wonderful plot line, skillfully told story, and an appealing darkness that is truly the best of Noir.",9,0,4,16 September 2005
Beowulf," Wonderful Story, More-or-Less Wonderful Movie
","I saw this movie today, the day it opened here. And had very mixed feelings about it.The story, and the script undergirding the story, is to me the best part of the movie. The execution of the script was to me partly good, partly not so good.I think it's the animation that most disappointed me. Maybe my expectations were staked too high based on pre-release buzz. But I'm really just mystified at those who rate the animation nearly perfect. Human faces and human bodies looked like comic book animation to me, except in those sequences in which either darkness or distance, or both, managed to obscure things enough to achieve a vivid genuineness that did indeed give me great pleasure.Outside views of the Northern Danish snowy fastnesses were uniformly delightful, IMHO. My very favorite sequence was that with the dragon at the end of the movie. What a wonderful sequence. And the end of the movie was true Northern/Norse-mythic in content and execution: I loved it.Acting was minimal but adequate for character depictions in a broad, sweeping mythic movie like this.All in all, though, the story ... the amazing mythic story of Beowulf ... carries this movie and gives it what is to me a deeply satisfying telling of a tale that deserves to be told again and again and again.Now if I can just get to see it in IMAX ...",7,1,9,16 November 2007
Munich," Great Story, Great Action
","This is very intense movie with great action, great suspense, fast pacing, wonderful cinematography, excellent use of flashback and color, and a wonderfully panoramic sweep from Israel to Europe to Lebanon to Brooklyn.The gradual evolution of Avnar is convincing and troubling ... and chilling. If anyone wants to see what Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) can look like, Avnar in the later part of this movie shows a fairly good picture of same. As a working psychotherapist with a specialization in trauma-related disorders, I can attest that the portrayal of Avnar in this regard reflects an authentic representation of trauma-driven mental and behavioral processes.There are moral ambiguities that are raised again and again. The moral ambiguity of the 'twilight services' I guess date back to John Le Carre's spy novels. One thing I myself liked about this movie, though, was that while it does dabble a little in 'moral equivalence', on the whole this was not pursued as relentlessly as in 'The Spy Who Came in from the Cold', for example. I myself came away with a clear sense that Munich, for example, involved a right and wrong side, as far as it goes: there were perpetrators and they were not the Israeli athletes but the Black September terrorists. Now this is, I'll admit, in contrast to what seems to be the general view of the movie: that Spielberg, following the Kushner book on which the movie is based, was indeed trying to paint the Israelis as being as much terrorists as the Black Septembrists of Munich. And I'll admit that, especially in the conversations between Avnar and his case manager, we see some real 'back and forth' that depicts the difficulties of the path that carried Avnar ... and Israel ... forward after Munich. Yet there is never any question, in my own reaction to the movie, that raison d'etat here is closely connected with Israel's .. and Avnar's ... deep sense that they are fighting for their Home. The assignments of Avnar and his team are (I think) always recognized as, at one level Justified: these are terrorists who slaughtered in Munich and elsewhere, after all; and yet these are humans, people, with families, with lives that the film depicts as startlingly 'normal.' It is naturally tempting to view the Terrorist as somehow inhuman; this movie makes clear that the Terrorist is a Terrorist *and* entirely human.The final ... or near-final, I can't recall ... scenescape of a New York skyline in which the Twin Towers are clearly recognizable adds for me a special sense of poignancy. The Towers were destroyed by Terrorists ... when? 9/11/2001? And I see this scene in December 2005. There's sort of a sense of both déjà vu (in the movie ... set in 1973-74) and flashback (for the viewer of the movie in 2005) that is remarkably moving from my angle.All in all, it seems that Spielberg was indeed trying to make a political 'statement' in this movie. But if you can ignore that and focus on this as a great flick with plenty of action and intrigue, hey, I think it's a great addition to this genre.",7,5,9,31 December 2005
Fantastic Four," Good Yarn, Good Story
","When I was a kid, Marvel Comics were my faves. The names of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby were almost magical to me. And yes, I read, and liked, the Fantastic Four.FF were different from a lot of comic book heroes for a number of reasons that were well depicted here in the film.First, and maybe most obviously, there were four of them. Instead of a single powerful character, like Superman or Batman, we had a group of Four. It has been remarked again and again that the TV show Friends was distinctive in the same way: a breakthrough comedy in which an ensemble of 6 equal characters are 'the Star'. Well, FF was in many ways like Friends: a super ensemble.Second, the heroes were all so very human. Lots of very human foibles and weaknesses. That comes through very well in this film.Third, the experience of the heroes is more important than the heroism of the heroes. This is conveyed by the film very well. When Sue Storm steps forward in the space station to look out over the earth from high, high above, we see her face reacting like ... well, like almost any of us would react: astonished, grateful, delighted. The scene is very unoriginal, yet it's set up with flawless adherence to the spirit of the situation, and we are conducted with a true story-teller's love of story through the brief but telling scene.Similarly, the *experience* of gaining their new 'powers' is conveyed with humor and authenticity and who among us can't feel the same sense of adventure and terror and horror and fun that our heroes experienced as they grew into their new selves.The *pattern* of correspondence and discordance between new powers and character is very striking. Two of the Four gain correspondent powers; two gain discordant powers.Correspondent are Johnny and Ben. Johnny, fiery, rash, brash, hotheaded, becomes the Torch. Ben, strong, rough, gruff, becomes the powerful Thing.Discordant are Reed and Sue. Reed, the intense and flexible scientist, becomes 'Stretch', sending his body into extraordinary feats of relaxation and flexibility. Sue, the extraordinary beauty, finds that her most salient power is to become invisible, her beauty hidden from even the most piercing eyes.All four of the Fantastic Four 'mesh' in ways that tell us that the Four who related with balance and humor before the Great Change, will continue to relate with balance and humor after the Great Change.Finally, to embed the new experiences of the Fantastic Four in the heart of New York, with tributes to the NYFD and NYPD clearly reminding us of these heroes of 9/11, is to help universalize the transformative experiences that they, and we, have undergone. No one has planned for the changes that have taken place: yet all have labored to accommodate those changes and make them part of who we are as we experience ourselves, and our life, on a daily basis.I think this is one of the distinctive gifts of the Comic Book world: to help us see life in broad, bold strokes, so that we are forced to lift our eyes above the dust and grit and see the big picture, the big themes.Unfortunately, this is a two-edged sword. Comics are cool, but their broad strokes cloy and tire and ultimately bore very rapidly. The movie could have been half as long as it was, and I would have been well satisfied.",6,4,8,17 August 2005
Hustle & Flow," This Flick Flows!
","I just saw this movie tonight, and now wonder why I didn't go see it sooner. Everything, but everything, about this movie was excellent.Acting. Terrence Howard is just fantastic. So really are all the actors and actresses.Characters. Rough bunch, to be sure, but all ... especially D Jay ... showed such deep humanity under very difficult circumstances that they were attractive, appealing, likable. I wanted to know what was going to happen to each and every one of them.Story. The plot, combining rags to riches with ghetto life with rap emergence ... was not in the least original, which is fine by me when the story is told with such skill and color and flavor and verve. It's a helluva yarn.The World. The world of the movie is one with which I am myself very unfamiliar. So I sure can't comment on Authenticity. But I can comment on Believability: and this movie has it and then some. A whole world was created and depicted and maintained with a strong, convincing presence that I found very, very deeply moving.Theme. Yes, it has a message. Not all message movies are effective. This one is, at least it is for me. The message is We gotta have dreams, and pursue them as best we can, within the parameters of the world as it really is. I came away from the movie feeling a sense of Hope and Gratitude. What a gift. What a movie.Combine a helluva story with great characterization with superb acting in a compellingly believable world with an uplifting theme ... and you have Hustle and Flow. What a wonderful movie.",9,0,0,28 August 2005
Atonement," Beautiful, Moving, Utterly Captivating Story of the Greatest Generation
","I saw this movie today the day after it opened here in general release. And I think this is the best movie I've seen in a long time.The visuals captured me from the first frame. What an amazing series of scenes: a beautiful late 1930s English country estate; wartime France; Dunkirk; wartime London. Every scene appeared perfectly composed, perfectly filmed, with perfect colors and sights and sounds. Authenticity and beauty were captured on every single frame of this movie. The attention to detail was exquisite without becoming at any point distracting. If there's such a thing as perfect cinematography and perfect lighting and perfect editing, this movie must come about as close to achieving these ideals as I for one can imagine. In fact, if this movie had had no dialog at all, I think I would have sat enthralled by the absolutely amazing visuals, from beginning to end.The story, though, was captivating in a special way. Special because of course we all know from the trailer what the basic plot is, and although there are important twists as things proceed, on the whole, we're watching a movie the storyline of which we already know. There's a special pleasure to watching something unfold like this, and I love the way the story was conveyed almost as much as I love the story itself. Deft flashbacks, with changes of point of view, convey so much of the richness of the story.To me, the interaction between the characters and their context is what made the whole story so fascinating. Here we have really very narrow parameters laid down and our characters must make their choices within those parameters with consequences of personal enormity for each of them. The film conveys the Character--Context interaction in an especially fine way by showing & repeating again and again. Sometimes the repetition comes through flashback: for example, in the fountain scene. Sometimes it comes through interleaving points of view: for example, near the beginning, when Cecilia and Robbie are thinking about each other. Most fascinating to me is when the repetition comes through a sort of deft camera's wheeling slowly and deliberately through a scene, following characters moving this way and that: for example, the amazing Dunkirk sequence.A key theme of the movie, as we all know from the trailer, is What's Real and What's Not. And this is played upon in so many wonderfully delightful ways. There are so many scenes through windows, and sights in mirrors, and POV shots up and down hallways and through fields; typewritten pages retyped and retyped and retyped. What we see, what we think we see, and what we do about what we see, or think we see, are all so intimately bound up with who we are: and this is expressed from beginning to end with a sense of authenticity and beauty that was for me just extraordinary.The characterizations and performances were just wonderful throughout this movie. James McAvoy's Robbie Turner was excellent. Keira Knightly's Cecilia Tallis was solid and convincing. Saorise Ronan as the young, 13 year old Briony Tallis was just extraordinary for her age I hope that we see more of this young talent. All of the supporting actors and actresses were first rate. Special props should go to Vanessa Redgrave for her affecting and very convincing cameo as the elderly Briony.Now I do have two criticisms that (to be honest) may or may not be reasonably laid at the doorstep of this movie.One is that to me, the build up to the arrest felt like it *may* have been somewhat long. Maybe a little shorter would be better. Maybe.Also, from time to time, I plain old had problems making out what was being said. I don't know if this is because I was simply so overwhelmed by the visual imagery that I wasn't paying as much attention to the dialog as I usually would. Or maybe the audio in my theater may have been a little off.But these are really minor drawbacks to the movie, if they are drawbacks to the movie at all. Again, I'm just not sure. To me this is simply a splendid, wonderful, and captivating movie no less.Before I close, I have something to say on a personal note.My father & mother were both members of 'The Greatest Generation' - the WWII generation which is depicted with such extraordinary clarity in this movie. My father was a soldier in WWII. My mother waited on the Home Front as she waited for him to come home. I take away from this movie a very strong sense that this is a true and authentic representation of what that period of time was like for this generation. I come away from this movie with a deep, deep, deep feeling of sheer gratitude for this generation. For the last half of the movie, I simply could hardly stop crying; and left the theater crying as well: tears of joy and gratitude and of sadness at the passing of this amazing generation.All in all, then, if you want to see an amazing period piece about the extraordinary and ordinary people of the Greatest Generation, set in the late 1930s  1940s: please, see this movie. It is absolutely one of the most delightful and authentic human tales of the World War II generation that I've ever had the privilege of experiencing. And the movie conveys its story with the most lovely, most beautiful, most affecting images that I have seen in years, perhaps decades.As I feel deep gratitude for this generation, I feel deep gratitude to Director Joe Wright and everyone who brought this movie to us. It seems so little to say, but I'll say it anyway: Thanks.",9,4,6,22 December 2007
V for Vendetta," Amazingly Bad Social Commentary Flick
","I went to see this movie this afternoon ... opening day here ... and was very, very disappointed.So disappointed that I left the theatre after waiting for an hour for things to improve. I almost never walk out of a movie. But it was really that bad this time. And I wasn't alone. It was a late afternoon showing, and the rows I was sitting in ... up front (I always like sitting up front) included just 3 other folks. All seated separately. The other 3 had all walked out before I did.There were two basic features of the movie that really moved it into the almost utterly awful category for me.One was the figure of V himself. Hugo Weaving's vocalization of the character as far as I could tell was fine; but V and the script built around V were amazingly bad. V is sort of a Zorro with a soft, urbane English accent, and a Mask that seems incongruously similar to that used in the Halloween movie series, and a penchant for quoting Shakespeare. He's sort of a wimpy Bard spouting wisdom and culture and death and murder and revolution in such winning tones that we're apparently supposed to be as captivated as his audience by him. When he appears on TV, the movie shows several scenes of The Common Man, Woman, and Child, watching and listening with rapt mesmerized attention to a vividly unappealing super hero with soft, wimpy tones and patronizing metro-sexual language that I just can't imagine The Great British Nation ... or the Great Any Nation ... finding so deeply appealing. I found especially obnoxious the repeated scenes in an English pub, with several working class blokes staring mesmerized at this clown spouting faux Shakespeare. Instead of cracking jokes and mockery at such (to use a term often used in other connections) Bollux.The other feature of the movie that rendered it extraordinarily unpleasant from my angle was its ham-fisted social commentary that boiled down to: Terrorism is just Another Name for Legitimate Resistance to Tyranny. In this day and age, that kind of moral equivalence is unusual mostly in its poor taste in this movie: to make the obvious even more obvious, there's a scene where the Natalie Portman character goes into a room full of the most amazing political kitsch and finds it Oh So Meaningful. So we see a portrait of a Union Jack titled 'Coalition of the Willing' with a Nazi banner across it; and a picture of Margaret Thatcher (I think?) bowdlerized to evidently reflect some mockery that we're supposed to applaud. The Regime is composed of Bishops, Clergy, and other figures of Faith who are all Bad (one Bishop's fondness for under-aged females makes a particularly nasty scene) and other Evil People. I don't mind at all social commentary but when it's this ham-fisted and this silly it becomes to me just coarse and silly and stereotyped. It makes me feel like I'm watching an old propaganda film out of the old Nazi or Communist 'Socialist Realism Theatre' days. Above all, though, the repeated vision of Terrorism as meaning Justice in Action is to me deeply offensive in these days after 9/11 and other such horrible tragedies. I think even Guy Fawkes ... the nasty real-life English terrorist on whom V is supposedly modeled ... must be rolling in his grave at such nonsense.Acting was decent but unexceptional, cinematography competent but uninteresting ... there was one sort of interesting scene early on from a London rooftop. Other than that, though, the script was just so horribly dismal as to make this a truly and amazingly bad movie.",2,9,21,17 March 2006
