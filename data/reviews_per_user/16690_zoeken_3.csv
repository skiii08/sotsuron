Deja Vu," Felt like a bad TV series
","Well, I had the idea when buying a ticket to Deja-Vu, I would be witness to a complex story involving mathematical time travel and so on. Instead the movie was a big disappointment, the storyline too simple and basically the whole movie felt like a mix of X-files and some other sci-fi TV series.Val Kilmer grew very old in this movie and is not up to any action in this movie, besides watching some big computer monitors and running around his office table. While Denzel Washington does compensate, he is not able to carry the movie as a whole, so if you expect a complex Deja-Vu, don't go, if you are in for a mere action ride thrill-seeker, well then go check it out. Its definitely not Tony Scott's best.",5,6,11,22 December 2006
The Matrix Reloaded," superman in love [part V]
","Story outlines a shaolin kung-fu master that has been upgraded to a superman in love.Neo, in this sequel upgraded to a superman who still lacks poor eyes due to the fact that he is constantantly wearing his sunglasses tries to save 'ravedancing' cavepeople from extermination.+spoliers+With the help of his other shaolin friends and his lover trinity they find 'the source', a room where a sort of nazi-professor has another boring semi-s***ty philosophy about using the right or the left door that either leads to the extinction of the cave-people or he can produce a new caverace by selecting 16 women and 7 men to form the new matrix:  uhuh.Hell, they all should die! Dancing and doing nothing underground all the time: get a live.I'd rate it a 6 for ripping off all those people out there who never saw a decent sci-fi. And the ending must be nominated for worst ending in 2003.I did like the matrix (pt I) for being obscure, fuzzy and somewhat intelligent, this sequel should never have been made.",Null,0,0,18 May 2003
Enemy at the Gates," piece of crap
","Last night I partially saw this movie on DVD. The first 10 minutes seemed to be an attempt to overthrow Spielberg's 'Saving private Ryan''s impressive start. English and American actors trying to play Russian officers and sniper's what a laugh; they don't evven speak russian. The movie could actually have been good, if they hired russian actors that actually speak Russian, to do the job.After 50 minutes I pushed the stop button, since the whole movie is a total farce and gives you a cheap TV serie feel. Even Jude Law couldn't bring me to see the ending.The battle ove Stalin(Lenin-) Grad needs a Russian remake. I am sure they know how portray this 2nd WW historical event, but this attempt was and still is a joke.Tip: try to get 'ballad of a soldier' (1958?) by Grigori Chukhraj. One of the best 'war-movies' made in cinematic history.",Null,1,2,15 November 2001
