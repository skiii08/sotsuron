Scarface," 10 Out Of 9! Truly A Classic!
","Arguably Pacino's Best Movie! 'Tony Montana', The way he tells it makes you want to watch this Great Masterpiece. I have no idea about how some of the people did not like 'Scarface'! Michelle Pffeifer's acting can also be considered as great, Steve Bauer's acting who plays the role of Manny Ribera is also worth wasting your time for!The Title is PERFECT, The Acting is at its BEST, The Direction is WONDERFUL, The Screenplay is AWESOME, The Story is UNIQUE! What else can you ask from a film with such adjectives!? Do not waste your time in watching some chick flicks, this movie made my day and will surely make yours! WATCH IT! 10/10",10,2,5,20 July 2011
