The Mask," For the cartoon lover in us all
","Jim Carrey lets it all out in `The Mask', and he hasn't stopped.  The role seems to be perfect for Carrey, who is famous for being the `rubber-faced' comedian of Hollywood.  In his true breakout role, Carrey plays bank teller Stanley Ipkiss.  We all know people like this: so friendly and nice that they become nothing but doormats and then are too nice to even ask us to stop.  However, after being tossed out of a nightclub one night (and being humiliated in front of his dream girl, played by Cameron Diaz), he finds a mysterious mask floating in the river.  It may seem like an ordinary mask for now, but when Ipkiss puts it on, his inner-self is released.  Finally, he's able to be as free-spirited and cartoon-like as he's always dreamed (we learn early on he's a huge cartoon fan).  He now has the power to do whatever he wanted but not before taking some revenge on those who make him miserable.   I watch this movie for two main characters: Ipkiss and his faithful dog Milo.  When the Mask is on the screen, the audience cheers.  When Milo is on the screen, they cheer even louder.  When Milo puts on the Mask well, you get the idea.  As usual, Carrey is an utter delight, letting loose in this role and bending it to his will.  It's this type of comedy that die-hard fans fell in love with, not to mention creating future roles including `Liar Liar', `Me, Myself and Irene', and `Bruce Almighty'.  I still laugh like crazy when Ipkiss puts on the mask.  For the record, if a person is not a fan of cartoons, then they are not going to like this movie.  It includes plenty of references to classic cartoon characters (not to mention a fitting tribute to Tex Avery's Wolf).  I'm an avid cartoon fanatic, so this was a movie that was right up my alley.  If you're an fan of the old animated slapstick, then I recommend this movie with 5 neon stars!  If not well, best try your luck somewhere else.",Null,0,0,11 October 2003
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Amazing animation and superb special effects
","In what may be defined as one of the most innovative and creative approaches to film, Robert Zemeckis holds no boundaries and brings us an amazing tale that holds a place in Hollywood's Finest. The story itself shows us a life in that we all dreamed about as children: a place where cartoons and humans live side by side. That's when the dream world becomes a nightmare and the cartoons find themselves on thin ice. One of the most respectable cartoon characters from ToonTown, Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer) is wanted for the murder of Marvin Acme (played in a short but comical role by Stubby Kaye), the very owner of ToonTown and Acme cartoon products; yes, you can now own dynamite, portable holes, and super Toon glue in your very own home. Without justice for toons, Roger finds himself at the end of the drawing table and only one step away from the wrath of Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd), who's only dream is to destroy ToonTown and everything in it. Out of desperation, Roger seeks help from human detective Eddie Valiant (played by Bob Hoskins in a landmark role). There's just two small problems: Valiant was hired only a few days ago to spy on Roger's wife Jessica, and things didn't look very good once it was discovered that she was playing 'pattycake' with Marvin Acme himself; also, Valliant refuses to work for toons, as his brother/partner was killed by a toon not too long ago (dropped a piano on his head). However, Valiant cannot turn Roger away (especially because now Roger's handcuffed himself to Valiant's arm), and agrees to take the case. Along the way, both Roger and Valiant discover a web of conspiracy linking Acme, Jessica, R.K. Maroon (head of Roger's cartoon studio), and the missing will of Marvin Acme that will ultimately decide who gets to run ToonTown. and whether or not it will end up just like its former owner.Who Framed Roger Rabbit brings to life the essence of murder mystery that became so popular in the 1940s, bringing out conspiracy, sex, lies, and murder in a dark tale that we watch with open eyes and find ourselves laughing the next minute. Unlike many other dark comedies, Zemeckis brings out the humor in decent proportion and reminding us that laughter can still be appreciated, even in a serious mystery. The movie also brings out a bright list of cartoon characters recognized by audiences of young and old, ranging from Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse, Woody Woodpecker, and introducing hilarious new characters such as Baby Herman, Roger's cigar-smoking partner in the cartoon business; Benny the Cab, a tough-talking taxi; Jessica Rabbit, showing us once and for all that just because you're a cartoon doesn't mean that you can't have serious sex appeal; and the Weasels, Judge Doom's gang of cartoon gangsters who do all of their boss's dirty work.Even with the superb list of characters, Who Framed Roger Rabbit showcases amazing special effects never before witnessed in film. While watching scenes where Roger and Valiant are side by side in the human world, the average viewer can almost believe that there really is a talking rabbit standing next to Hoskins (in the imagination, anyway). The interaction between the real actors and the cartoons is simply eye-popping and leads the way for an entire new branch of filming and animation. All in all, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a legend of its own time and a simple reminder that children are not the only ones who can appreciate good animation.",10,0,0,16 October 2002
Fight Club," I am Jack's Success in Cinema
","This has got to be one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Brad Pitt & Edward Norton pull out all the stops as two men who start up fight clubs as a new form of therapy.  I would normally talk about the plot here, but it's so hard to find where to begin.  The story takes so many twists and turns that the usual person would be completely lost, but they're not.  In a way, this is one of those movies that makes even the most incompetent human being feel smart... which is good.  I used to get into fights with my family about this movie; my Mom was outraged by the amount of violence and vandalism, and all I replied was, 'Hey, you went to therapy, it takes different strokes to quit being so screwed up.'  Of course, I took martial arts and knew about the healing power of fighting and how it always released my stress.  Apparently, Mom didn't get it.Everything about this movie is awesome: the script, the characters, the acting, the special effects (the opening credits and scene showing how the Narrator's apartment was destroyed were so cool), everything.  Unless you're against violence in any way, shape, or form, I highly recommend this movie.",10,0,1,14 May 2003
Memento," One slight problem...
","I really liked this movie, but I feel really compelled to point something out.  We discussed anterograde amnesia (the condition that doesn't allow a brain to produce short-term memory) in my Psychology class in college, and if the main character really had this condition, he wouldn't remember. Seriously, a person with anterograde amnesia doesn't have the memory to even remember their condition.  We read about a man who had this condition, and to study his behavior, researchers gave him a diary with a note on the cover that said, 'Write in me when you get up.'  Every morning, when the man woke up, he wrote in the diary that it was the first morning after his operation. If Leonard really had anterograde amnesia, he wouldn't even have the memory to remember what the heck is wrong with him.  Yeah, I liked the movie, but this is something that I just can't forget.",Null,0,2,14 May 2003
Home Alone," Who doesn't remember this?
","Home Alone is a cultural staple in the lives of millions of people. Ask anyone from the ages of 15 to 50, and they'll remember this movie. With a simple plot, great acting, and slapstick out the wazoo, Home Alone is an indispensablemovie, not to mention the film that launched Macaulay Culkin to stardom. Like previously stated, the plot is simple. Kevin McAllister (Culkin) is an 8-year old kid, the youngest in a rather large family, and he hates it. For those of us who grew up in huge families, we can identify with Kevin when he shouts,'When I grow up and get married, I'm living alone! Did you hear me? I'MLIVING ALONE!' That night, after ruining his family's dinner (of course, he was provoked by his older brother), Kevin wishes that his family would disappear. The next morning, Kevin gets his wish. While he thinks his family has justcompletely disappeared, little does he know that they left early for Paris and miscounted (they mistook the next-door neighbor kid as him). Realizing now is his chance to do whatever he wants, Kevin has the time of his life: going through his brother's room, jumping on the bed, watching R-rated movies, the works. However, Kevin is smarter than he looks, and notices that two moronic burglars (played perfectly by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) have been snooping aroundhis house. When he overhears them deciding to rob the house on ChristmasEve, he pulls together some of the most complex and elaborate booby-traps that would be the envy of professional snipers. The audience roots for the endless slapstick, laughing even harder as the burglars get more and more determinedto find Kevin and get rid of him. While this is going on, Kevin's mom (Catherine O'Hara) is trying desperately to get home and make sure her son is OK. Home Alone is proof that American audiences love to see the bad guys get thesnot kicked out of them. With paint cans in the face, tacks up the foot, broken glass on the floor, heads getting set on fire, and trips galore, we just can't stop laughing. Of course, the moving also has heart, including a sweet reunion with Kevin & his family, plus his friendship to a street shoveler.I recommend this movie to anyone. 10/10.",Null,0,1,7 September 2004
Watchmen," Who Watches the Watchmen? .... We do!
","I'll go ahead and admit it: I have never read the original 'Watchmen' graphic novel (always wanted to, never really got the chance), and when my husband and I saw the first couple teaser trailers, we agreed on one thing: 'OK, so this is a superhero movie... but what the heck is it about?!?' Still, we knew just how big the graphic novel was, so after reading up a little on the backstory, we went to see it on the opening weekend.When I went in, I wasn't sure what to expect: the reviews had been pretty split, and a few of my friends had even gone on to say that this was the worst 3 hours of their lives. Still, I was determined to see it, and for once, I was glad I didn't listen to my friends... 'Watchmen' is a dazzling tour-de-force that grabs the viewer's attention and refuses to let go.There is little that I can find to hate about 'Watchmen': the casting was great (the actors truly blend into their characters, none more-so than Jackie Earle Haley, who completely disappears into the role of Rorschach), the visual effects are great, and no matter how many subplots are going on (and trust me, there are a few), you still can't look away.The most important aspect, however, is that this is NOT a movie for fanboys. Zach Snyder was determined to stay as close to his source material as possible, so much that many people were worried that they only ones who would like this movie would be those die-hard fans who actually dress up as Nite Owl & Dr. Manhattan for the midnight showings (you know who you are). However, the movie is great, and does not just play out to those who already read the novel. As I stated before, I have yet to read it, and I was able to follow what was going on clearly.Alan Moore, the genius who gave us the original graphic novel, has apparently sworn to never watch this movie; that's his prerogative. He evidently doesn't trust Hollywood to do justice to his work, and I'm sorry he has such little faith, because Snyder does not disappoint. I highly recommend 'Watchmen' to anyone, young and old alike, this is one of those rare movies that you can easily see over and over again.",10,7,15,8 March 2009
The Nightmare Before Christmas," What's This??
","This has always been one of my favorite Halloween movies.  Even if it isn't scary, the brilliant claymation and design of Halloween town is truly amazing.Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon/Danny Elfman) has grown tired of the same old scares and traditions of Halloween, yet feels as though no one in his kingdom of Halloweentown would understand.  One night while walking, he stumbles upon a collect of doors, each leading to a different world ruled by a certain holiday (a heart-shaped door for Valentine's Day, a shamrock for St. Patrick's Day, etc.).  However, he becomes completely mesmerized by the Christmas door and, upon discovering the world of Christmastown, finds what he believes he has been missing for so long.  However, no one in Halloweentown can truly understand Christmas.  Suddenly, Jack gets the idea of having his fellow goblins and monsters take over Christmas, and things go topsy-turvy really fast as children are given gifts of shrunken heads, vampire teddy-bears, man-eating snakes, the list goes on.  During all of this, the real Santa Claus (Ed Ivory) is held captive in Halloweentown by the Oogie Bogie Monster (Ken Page), who has plans to eat Santa before the night is up; and Sally (Catherine O'Hara), a living rag-doll who has fallen in love with Jack tries to save Christmas before it's too late.This truly goes as one of Tim Burton's masterpieces, not to mention a timeless classic that looks at both Christmas and Halloween from a totally different view.  The music is wonderful, with catchy songs like `What's This?' and `Kidnap Sandy Claws'.  Danny Elfman has always been one of my favorite composers, and the soundtrack to Nightmare Before Christmas is a true credit to his name.  Regardless if you're more of a Halloween or Christmas person, be sure to check this one out.",10,1,2,31 October 2003
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Nothing could be sweeter...
","Growing up, my favorite book was, easily, 'Charlie & the Chocolate Factory'. Roald Dahl's magical tale of a young boy's adventure in the strange factory was spell-binding. Though I never had a problem with the original 'Willy Wonka' move with Gene Wilder (despite how unfaithful it was, it was still a cute and heart-warming movie), I was doing back-flips when I heard Tim Burton, quite possibly my all-time favorite director, would helm a new version of the movie.First and foremost, Johnny Depp is perfect as Willy Wonka. What people don't really pick up from the first movie is that Wonka was intended to be, well, crazy. He was eccentric and freaky, the way he allowed the rotten children to get what they deserved and protected his factory like it was his child. Gene Wilder portrayed Wonka more like a fatherly-figure, and really was just too nice. Depp pulls out all of the stops as a new Willy Wonka, though there are times that any audience member will get just a bit freaked out.What I loved most about the movie was how faithful it was to the book. Everything that was mentioned, from the chocolate palace to the hair toffee, was taken directly from the book. I was incredibly impressed.This is definitely a movie for everyone, especially those of us who hold the original tale in our hearts. Wonka chocolate bars for all!",Null,450,651,12 July 2005
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," A major fan is sadly disappointed
","*For all of you who haven't read the book, I suggest you stop reading now. Spoilers ahead*For starters, let me say that I am a huge Harry Potter fan, and have been for quite some time.  The books are wonderful, and I was very impressed with the first movie.  However, I have to say that I was expecting more out of Chamber of Secrets than this.Just like The Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets follows the book extensively well; a person can almost recite the lines from the book directly onto the movie screen.  However, the second Harry Potter movie does not move the audience as the first one did.  Perhaps it is because the first movie did so much introduction, or maybe it is because I've read Chamber of Secrets one too many times (a side effect of waiting for both the movie and the fifth book to come out), but this one seemed to be lacking a lot of what the first movie dished up.First of all, the movie seems to be centered entirely on Harry, Ron, and Hermione.  OK, they are the main characters, but this does not mean that we have to focus on them and them alone.  Many other major characters are not given a fair time on the screen, namely the professors and other students. Here is the first part of where the movie leaves the book: Chamber of Secrets gave a lot of attention not only to the main crisis (students being petrified), but also to Harry's classes (which, I might add, needs to cut Draco Malfoy and the other Slytherins from it, because all of us who follow the book know that for the first two books, Slytherins only had Potions class with Gryffindors).  The book pays attention only to Herbology because of the significant use of the mandrakes.  Transfiguration is the only other class seen in the movie, and that is barely given any notice at all.  Even though the movie gives more notice to Malfoy (a complaint made by many who saw Sorcerer's Stone), he is cut dramatically from the story, only seen in the sections where he is needed for further plot development; it would have been better if he and the other characters were given more time to be seen, and not as a background.My other problem, though this one I can let go, is the cutting of my two favorite sections of the chapters: the Deathday party and the Valentine's Day celebration.  John Cleese, reprising his role as Nearly Headless Nick, is given just enough time to be seen before he finds himself petrified, and this is given only a few lines following it near the end.  Anyone who knows the book will know that Nick was a central part of the story and deserves more screen time.  The Valentine's Day section was important because it gave Harry more of a reason to be curious about Riddle's diary, but the movie has it look like he just found out how it worked by pure dumb luck.  Yes, Chamber of Secrets does seem to exist decently without these two sections (more than likely cut out because of lack of time), but I would have preferred to have them in it.Of course, the acting in the movie is wonderful, just as it was in Sorcerer's Stone.  Kenneth Branagh gives a wonderful performance as Gilderoy Lockhart, but, as stated previously, it would have been better if he were given more time on screen.  All of the returning characters once again play their roles to a `T', with Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron), Emma Watson (Hermione), Richard Harris (Dumbledore), Maggie Smith (McGonagall), Alan Rickman (Snape), Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid), and even all of the returning students performing magnificently.   The special effects are wonderful as well, with eye-popping scenes with Harry fighting the basilisk, the flying car, and the giant spiders, all keeping the audience on the edge of their seats.Unfortunately, acting and special effects are not enough to keep this movie afloat.  The movie itself is great, but it is not enough to please die-hard fans of Harry Potter (and believe me, there are plenty out there).  Sorry, but it is this reviewer's opinion that Chamber of Secrets does not live up to its prequel, and it is my hope that Prisoner of Azkaban will save the series.",8,1,2,17 November 2002
Hercules," Good, but not well-researched
","I'm a huge fan of Greek mythology, so even though I really liked this movie, I couldn't stop knit-picking all the little details that Disney screwed up. Here's just a short list:1) Hercules wasn't Hera's son.  In fact, she hated him!2) Amphitryon, Hercules's foster dad, wasn't alive.  Zeus came to Alcmene in the form of her dead husband's spirit.3) Hercules wasn't a god.  He was the son of a god (Zeus) and a mortal (Alcmene), making him a demigod. However, he did gain access to Mt. Olympus following his death. 4) The titans were not the monsters depicted in the movie.  They were the Gods before the Greek Gods came on the scene, though it was after Zeus came along that they lost most of their power and got smaller jobs.5) Hades was never `sentenced' to be the God of the Underworld; he asked for the job.  Zeus even tried to persuade him not to do it.6) Hercules never rode Pegasus; that's a totally different legend.OK, I'll admit that I'm anal-retentive about the facts, but honestly, I really did like the movie.  James Woods was hilarious as Hades (I couldn't stop laughing, he obviously had a lot of fun doing his lines), and Megara has got to be my favorite Disney heroine ever.  This is definitely a movie for all ages; as long as you can get the Greek mythology fans to shut up for five seconds, you'll enjoy it.",Null,8,15,22 October 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Lucas, you finally made a better movie than 'Empire'
","This is it, the movie that fans have been waiting to see for God knows how long. An average viewer would think that the expectations are too high, that no matter what the movie delivers, they will be sadly disappointed because they wanted more. That doesn't happen in 'Revenge of the Sith'. Not a person walks out of that movie theater thinking that they have been let down. 'Revenge of the Sith' is the final 'Star Wars' film and finally ties together the pre-trilogy of Anakin Skywalker's life with the future story of Luke, Han, and Princess Leia.We see the big battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan Kenobi, the birth of the twins Luke and Leia, and the unavoidable creation of the Galactic Empire. The audience is on the edge of their seats as Anakin agrees to serve the Dark Side as everyone's favorite villain, Darth Vader. You can feel yourself almost pleading him to stop, for Anakin to realize what he's doing and see through the Emperor's tricks, but of course, you know that's not going to happen. Lucas has put together a stellar masterpiece to end the saga. When the Jedi are unmercifully hunted down and killed, one is reminded of the climatic scene from 'The Godfather', when Michael settled 'all family business'. When the movie ends, you'll be sitting in your seat, grinning from ear to ear, and all you'll want to do is shout 'REWIND!'",9,3,5,20 May 2005
Fantastic Four," Special Effects and One Hot Chick, a Movie Does Not Make.
","In the early 2000s, comic books entered into a new Renaissance in film. Sony gave us 'Spiderman', 20th Century Fox made 'X-Men', and every studio in Hollywood immediately started grabbing up every single superhero story they could get their hands on. So it was only a matter of time before Fox decided to bring Marvel's first family to the big screen: The Fantastic Four.So here's what the studio does: first of all, make sure that the budget can give them realistic-looking superpowers (actually, that's the one thing the movie does right). As far as the script goes well, they apparently only had enough money for the special effects. The humor is forced, the science is hokey, most of the dialog in the movie is delivered via bickering, and quite frankly, it seems like there are more plot holes than actual plot points! The characters are lacking serious development, and it's obvious that this movie suffered from some serious poor choices in casting. I know that the studio obviously thought casting Jessica Alba would bring in more revenue (once they stopped drooling over her in the blue jumpsuit), but doing so brings the iconic character of Sue Storm down to nothing but eye candy. In the comics, Johnny Storm was a fun-loving teenager, and frankly, the corny one-liners and immature whining that the script gives us may actually have made more sense had they actually cast someone a big younger than Chris Evans, who is not only way too old for the part but also looks older than Alba. Actually, scratch that: no actor could have pulled off the lousy writing they gave this character. Julian McMahon isn't the worst choice to play a comic book villain, but there is no transition from scummy business tycoon to actual psychopath. When does he suddenly decide that he's capable of murder? The pacing in the film is all over the place. It seems like the directors wanted to get to the action sequences as quickly as possible but the action is incredibly lacking. The final battle with Doom is over way too quickly. In fact, there's a few scenes where Johnny (sans fire) performs a number of stunts that actually seem more hyped up and better shot than the big finale! On a side note, the Extended Cut gives us a little more dimension to the characters (especially Ben's relationship with Alicia), although the editors should be shot for throwing in their little tribute to Wolverine (I won't spoil it, but it's nauseating). As we all know, Marvel started its own studio to get better control of the movies they release, which has proved more than effective with 'Iron Man' and 'The Incredible Hulk'. Let us all hope that after they finish with their current line-up, they decide to go back and fix this monstrosity. 'The Fantastic Four' was one of Marvel's greatest creations and the characters deserve better than this.",3,0,1,18 June 2009
