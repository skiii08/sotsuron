Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 'Â¿Science-fiction?' with all world's money
","To see things like this saga of films (Star-Wars), to listen and to read the commentaries that are made praising the grandiloquence of the special effects, and to think that just by these things can be thought that a huge film has become, makes me blush of other peoples shame. In these films one becomes, in the first place, an authentic scorn to which is science, reason why only it is left the fiction: How it is possible that it tries to do to think that in the empty space immense explosions are listened, that the ray-laser can hit to each other, see as if fluorescent lights they were, and stop their trajectory to 1'5 meters of the grip of a sword without obstacles? The amount of nonsense histories that are counted,  surrounded by pseudo-epics comic strips, overcomes the patience of any mind moderately CRITICIZES. Sure if the question is to say 'amen' to a gigantic economic assembly to sell dolls, t-shirts, small gifts of all type with personages of a stupid film, The assembly is very well. But I feel it, me cannot swallow. It's very indigestible.",2,0,1,2 October 1999
