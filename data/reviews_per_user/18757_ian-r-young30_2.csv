","Worst film I have seen in years, it was Â£3 and not worth that. It's tedious, mind numbingly obvious, shallow and boring. Small characters, no development, no resolution, nothing to be learned from this waste of time.For a very similar film with some substance I would recommend Inception. It's marginally less tedious.This film has clearly received a high rating as its focused almost entirely on a single character as per films such as gran Torino, which apparently makes a film clever.Gladly I took it back and replaced it, because I fancied a drive, otherwise it would have been snapped and binned, rubbish.",1,2,8,19 August 2013
