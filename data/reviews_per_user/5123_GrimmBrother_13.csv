Walk the Line," A good film for older age groups
","The Plot A chronicle of the life of famous singer Johnny Cash and his struggle with his family, his career, drugs and the love of his life.The Pros This film will appeal to mostly older people. Younger people might not enjoy it, especially teenagers and kids. It is very similar to the film Ray, which is strange seeing as it's basically saying that Ray Charles and Johnny Cash had very similar happenings in their lives. The music and singing is very good for actors who don't usually sing. The cast and the acting are fantastic. Overall, it isn't a bad film at all.The Cons It tends to get boring. Younger people might not appreciate it because they aren't familiar with Johnny Cash's music. Worth Hiring/Buying? If you are a Johnny Cash fan or a collector of Oscar winning films, this might be a good addition to add to your collection but it isn't anything spectacular in my opinion. But since more adults like it than teenagers than perhaps you can try it out.The Final Word I'm giving this film 6/10, which isn't a bad rating, so check out this film if you want to see how hard it really is to be a successful celebrity.",6,0,2,24 December 2006
United 93," A sad and hard-to-watch film about 9/11
","United 93 is a disturbing and hard to watch film about the attacks in America on September 11, 2001. Everyone knows what happened on that fateful day, but this film brings it to life remarkably.As I'm sure you know, four planes were hijacked on September 11 2001 and three of them reached their targets. However, this film is about the fourth plane; United Airlines 93. That plane never made its target because of the strong will of the innocent passengers on board who caused the plane to crash in a field near Pennsylvania instead of its intended target, the White House.I believe everyone should see this film. It is a strong account of 9/11 and deserves a lot of credit.You might find this film very hard to watch, especially if you have some kind of connection to the people who lost their lives on 9/11.I came out of this film feeling very sad. I didn't say much. I was thinking about these poor innocent people. The saddest thing about this film is that it is all true. At least most of it is. Director Paul Greengrass based this film upon the last recordings from the cockpit cabin and the telephone calls made by the passengers to their loved ones.The cast of mainly unknown actors was each given studies of the people on Flight 93 that they were playing. Families of the passengers and crew members killed on United Flight 93 cooperated in the production of the film.They offered Greengrass detailed background information about their loved ones. They even told them what clothes they wore and what they read, listened to, or even might have eaten on the plane.The film is not only about what happens aboard the plane. It also shows what happened in the air traffic control rooms and the reactions by people who witnessed the attacks on the World Trade Centre.I liked the acting by the unknown ensemble cast. I think it was better to not cast known actors in this film.",7,2,3,24 December 2006
The Devil Wears Prada," A witty and clever comedy
","Andy Sachs has just graduated from college. She hopes to land a job as a journalist for a popular magazine. But instead of becoming a writer for a magazine, she becomes the personal assistant to Miranda Priestly, the editor in chief for a top-notch fashion magazine called Runway.Miranda, a ruthless and cynical woman, dominates the fashion world. She makes outrageous demands that have to be carried out immediately and within time limits, otherwise the people in charge of running the errands could be fired.She is very outspoken and honest and not afraid to speak the truth about what she thinks about someone. Andy, however, puts up with the unconventional and humiliating requests from Miranda because, she is told, if she lasts a year in the position she could land any job she wants, even the journalistic one she desperately wants.As Andy adjusts to the position, she starts to change. From a young woman with no sense of fashion who always had time for her family and friends, Andy becomes career obsessed as she pays more attention to her job than anything else.Ultimately Andy realizes that she must make a choice between her family and her friends and the job she has worked so hard for, as she starts to become more and more like the woman she despises working for.The film is witty, funny and clever. There is not much you can't like about it. The characters are great, with the actors delivering solid performances. Meryl Streep portrays Miranda brilliantly as the wicked person she is and Anne Hathaway is as sweet as ever as Andy Sachs. The two have great chemistry together.The film does not follow the book by Lauren Weisberger very closely, but is very good none the less.The Devil Wears Prada is not the best comedy of the year but it is definitely worth seeing. Whether you are male or female, this film is sure to entertain you.I advise all bosses to go see this.In the wise words of Miranda Priestly, 'That's all.'",7,0,0,24 December 2006

X-Men: The Last Stand," Special effects will blow you away
","X Men: The Last Stand is unfortunately the third and last in the X Men film series, but nonetheless, it is a brilliant epic filled with action, suspense, romance and adventure.In the third film, a cure has been found for mutants. Many mutants disagree with the cure while others are more than happy to accept it. In the meantime, an old X Men character is resurrected and now possesses a power like no other mutant in the world. This power is potentially dangerous as it can control anything and everything.Magneto takes it upon himself to find the powerful mutant so he and his fellow 'bad guy' mutants can destroy the cure and humans for good.X Men 3 features state of the art special effects that will blow you away. The emotion that the actors put into their characters comes across very well. There isn't much to complain about, only that it is most unfortunate that 3 extremely important characters are killed while another 2 important mutants are cured. I won't say anymore, you will have to go check out this film for yourself.X Men fans, don't fret. Even though this is the last in the X Men film series this isn't the last we'll see of Wolverine. A spin off, Wolverine, will be released in 2007. It hasn't even started filming yet and only Hugh Jackman, who plays Wolverine, has signed up for the project.",6,1,2,24 December 2006
Saw II," Gripping and intriguing
","The Plot In the sequel to the excellent 2004 film, Jigsaw locks a few unlucky people in a house filled with booby traps and they must find a way out before they inhale too much of a lethal nerve gas and die. But they must watch out, for if they don't figure out what each of them have in common, the traps Jigsaw has set in the shelter will lead to gruesome deaths.The film also centers around a cop who is trying everything in his power to save his son who is in the house with all the other people.The Pros The story is very clever, much like the first one which was better. The gore and the blood is awesome and the acting is surprisingly good too. The booby traps are the best, as you watch these poor innocent people battle to save their lives by getting out of the brilliantly built traps. Don't think this is a lame horror film because it actually isn't. It is really worth watching.The Cons Some people may not be able to handle the blood and gore and might just be put off, but that's their problem. They would be missing out on a really great story.Worth hiring/buying? It is definitely worth hiring. Buy only if you're a horror movie collector.The Final Word A non-stop gore fest with intelligent writing and directing. This film will appeal to all avid horror fans,",8,0,1,24 December 2006
The Da Vinci Code," An intriguing adventure filled with secrets, mysteries and murder
","I picked up the book by Dan Brown about 2 months before the film came out and entered into the world of secrets, mysteries and murder. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and was rather worried about how it would translate to screen. But it was done rather well.Plot: Robert Langdon a Harvard professor of iconography and religious art is called in when a famous curator, Jacques is found dead in a historical museum. Jacques left behind a series of codes and clues for Langdon and his granddaughter Sophie Neveu, a French cryptologist, to unravel and discover the truth about many things to do with the past and the present. As Robert and Sophie begin breaking the codes, many secrets are revealed that delve into the works of Leonardo da Vinci and the clues that he might have left behind in his paintings. They go on an adventure to discover the true meanings behind the famous works of Leonardo da Vinci. The film reveals a lot about historical times and the Holy Grail. Many twists result.What's right with it? The cast is great, although Tom Hanks didn't do such a great job at playing Robert Langdon. The story is clever and imaginative and the sets and scenery add to the film's fine details. Most things in the book were included in the film but plenty was shortened. All in all the film is quite entertaining and it makes you wonder.What's Wrong With It? The film does start off quite slow in the first 10 minutes or so and you may find that you are bored but don't fret, the film quickly picks up pace later on. I was upset by one particular thing that was left out at the end of the film. It would've only taken the filmmakers less than a minute to include it in the movie but unfortunately it disappeared completely. If you are clever, though, you may figure it out for yourself.Verdict The Da Vinci Code won't please all, especially religious Christians but it was well done and deserves credit. But all in all, the story is better in the form of a book than in the form of a film.",6,0,1,24 December 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," A magical movie
","Plot: In Harry, Ron and Hermione's fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, trouble looms as Lord Voldemort's followers, the Death Eaters signal his return at the Quidditch World Cup.Meanwhile at school the Triwizard Tournament is being hosted by Hogwarts where three schools compete against each other in three dangerous tasks for eternal glory. Harry's name emerges from the Goblet of Fire selecting him for the tournament.But since Harry never submitted his name, who did? Harry is alone as he faces the deadly challenges that lie ahead of him, including finding a date for the Yule Ball.What's Right With It? Almost everything. The acting is better than before and the filmmakers have added in suspense, comedy, action and horror all into one brilliant film.Each and every scene is entertaining. There isn't a dull moment. The music, sets and special effects are superb!What's Wrong With It? There is nothing particularly wrong with the film itself but it is a pity that so much from the book was left out, including Hermione's hilarious anti house-elf slave campaign S.P.E.W, the Weasleys meeting the Dursleys, the actual Quidditch World Cup match, the magical creatures in the maze, Rita Skeeter's dark secret and of course many explanations. But overall the film was a good edit of the original book.Special Features: There is a whole second disc crammed with features, including additional scenes with Snape and Igor, The Weird Sisters playing a song at the Yule Ball, the trio talking about a death and plenty more. Other features include a behind the scenes look at each Triwizard Tournament task as well as preparation for the Yule Ball and the infamous Graveyard scene.There are interviews with the cast as well as an introduction to new characters. There are also four games based on each task and the Graveyard.Verdict: This DVD was well worth the money. It is enjoyable and fun to watch. Let's hope the next three Harry Potter films do justice to the last four.Acting : 8/10, Cast: 9/10, Set: 10/10, Costumes: 9/10, Plot: 9/10 Make-up: 8/10, Music: 8/10, Dialogue: 8/10, Humour: 8/10, Story Conclusion: 9/10Total: 9/10 Special Features: 7/10",8,1,2,24 December 2006
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," Fans of the D Will Love It, others...not so much
","For all of you older people out there who have not caught up with the MTV Generation, Tenacious D is the rock band of Jack Black of 'School of Rock' and 'Shallow Hal' fame. He teamed up with his mate Kyle Gass and together the two of them created a 'cult' band.Tenacious D in: The Pick of Destiny is a film about the fictional account of how the band formed.The film starts off with a hilarious song sung by Jack Black, depicting his life as a child in a religious family who think of rock as 'The Devil's Music'. Rock is JB's life and he feels that if his family won't accept that then he will run away from home. And he does just that. Many years pass as JB travels through LA, he meets a street guitarist KG. Thinking that KG is a famous rock star, JB decides to 'audition' for KG's so-called band. The two soon discover that fate has lead them to each other through unusual circumstances.Thereafter, the film takes a giant leap into absolute ridiculousness. The new partners in crime go on a quest for 'The Pick of Destiny', a guitar pick that has allowed all the legendary rock stars of today to play outstanding music that they had never heard before.The soundtrack features songs by Tenacious D and is a great addition to the film. Obviously this film is not meant to be taken seriously, but I did not think it was executed very well.Jack Black has been a real disappointment to me lately. He is a comedic genius yet he is wasting his time on rubbish films. His most recent, The Holiday, dumbed him down so much that it was hard to believe that this was actually Jack Black. He was not allowed to show off his comedic abilities and was just in the film for lame comic relief.However, this film was obviously made for fans of Black and Gass's band Tenacious D and will surely be loved by all of them. With its crude humour and offensiveness, Tenacious D definitely won't give Borat a run for his money but will still entertain fans of the 'D'.5/10",4,4,11,20 January 2007
The Holiday," An all-star cast can't save this predictable romantic farce
","If you like movies that are predictable, cliché-ridden and rely on an all star cast to be a success, then The Holiday will interest you.The Holiday stars Cameron Diaz, Jack Black, Kate Winslet and Jude Law. One can only wonder what these Hollywood stars were thinking when they agreed to be in this romantic farce. Nancy Meyers did write the film with all these actors in mind but it doesn't mean that they had to go ahead and make fools of themselves by starring in this.The Holiday is about two women. Amanda lives in LA. She has a big house and owns a movie advertising company. Her life falls apart when she finds out that her boyfriend is cheating on her. Fed up with her life, Amanda finds a home exchange website and decides to swap homes with a woman named Iris who lives in London. Iris' life also happens to be falling apart when the man that she is in love with gets engaged and doesn't tell her.When the two women switch lives, they meet men who they fall for and a roller-coaster of every romantic comedy cliché ensues.Men should stay as far away as possible from this film even if it does star Cameron Diaz, and women should steer clear too. Who wants to go see a movie about two women who mope around all day complaining about how terrible their lives are when there are people out there who are far worse off then they are? I suppose Nancy Meyers needed Jack Black for the comedy element but he was seriously out of place in this rubbish.The film is overly long too. It is just over two hours.Rather watch something else, seriously, there's far better than this mess.",3,0,2,24 December 2006
The Queen," A Great Film
","In September this year it will have been 10 years since Princess Diana died in a car accident while being hounded and perused by the paparazzi.This film tells the story about how the Queen handled Diana's death between the time of Diana's passing and the funeral. It also focuses on Prime Minister Tony Blair when he first comes into power, as well as Prince Charles, Prince Phillip, the Queen Mother and of course the members of the British public.The world is shaken by Diana's death and it appears that the royal family is doing nothing to address the issue. The Queen has not even appeared in public and this enrages people of the UK.The Queen, as you all know, was not very fond of Diana at all. In fact, the entire Royal Family did not accept her as one of their own.The Queen uses brilliant metaphoric symbols throughout the film which is left for the viewer to pick out.It also uses real footage of Diana and the public's reactions.However, everything else is acted and by exceptional actors at that. Michael Sheen is a very talented actor who pulls off the role of Tony Blair as if he were the Prime Minister himself.But Helen Mirren is of course the true star. Watching this film is just like watching the real Queen Elizabeth II. Helen portrays every aspect of the Queen perfectly, which will surely earn her a Best Actress Oscar.The Queen will probably not take home the Best Picture Award. That is surely to go the The Departed but it is still a marvelous film that deserves an excellent 8/10.",8,0,0,20 January 2007
Happy Feet," One of the most entertaining films of 2006
","Happy Feet is one of the best animations of the year. It is clever, funny, brilliantly made and has the most outstanding special effects a CGI animation has ever had. The film's animation is so realistic that even the penguins look real.The film is about penguins living in Antarctica in what they call Emperor Land. It is a tradition for the penguins to use their 'heart song' to find their soul mate by singing.The film's protagonist, Mumble was born tone deaf and cannot sing but has a unique talent for tap dancing, which is looked down upon by the elders of Emperor Land. Mumble is an outcast for his entire childhood and things do not get any better when he becomes a young adult.He ventures across Antarctica, meeting new friends who accept him as he is. He and his 'amigos' face death-defying obstacles. Soon Mumble discovers that there is a shortage of fish in Emperor Land and he and his friends go on a quest to find out what is really happening.Happy Feet has something for all age groups. It has the cutest penguins you will ever see for the young children, funny scenarios for the older ones, witty and funny one liners for the teenagers and music for the older generation.Happy Feet is one of the best films of the year and deserves a lot of praise.",8,0,0,24 December 2006
