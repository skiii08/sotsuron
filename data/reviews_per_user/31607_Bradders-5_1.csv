Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not what it was cracked up to be, but a great ride!
","Being a big SW fan, I was extremely excited to see this movie.  But what I saw dissapointed greatly.  Where was the classic Williams soundtrack, and where was the great editing that accopanied the first trilogy?  Add to that the fact that Annakin was an 'immaculate' conception, the thought of walking out of the theatre crossed my mind, although I did stay 'til the end.  I left the theatre bitterly dissapointed, but determined to see it again.I am glad I did return to see it once more as I loved it this time round!  I relished every minute, and while I noticed the poor editing, the missing classic soundtrack was okay. Lucas has made a movie that in terms of the original trilogy as a benchmark, is easily better than ROTJ but nowhere near as good as ESB.The effects are stunning, especially the climactic battle between the Gungans and the Trade Federation, I also defy anybody not to find the final Lightsabre battle breathtaking.Despite generally poor performances from the cast, Portman and Neeson shine through despite an awful script.Maybe I have grown up, or this is a bad movie, but it just doesn't live up to the classic trilogy, but on it's own, it's the greatest sci-fantasy film you'll have seen since ROTJ.",7,0,0,1 August 1999
