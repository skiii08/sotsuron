The Longest Yard," Sandler as MVP football player.... uhhh.... yeah.
","I actually rented this movie on purpose thinking it might be similar to the first. Whew, was I wrong. First, watching Sandler as a former football MVP is like watching Woody Allen as Superman. It just doesn't work. I was thinking that this had to be just horrible miscasting until I saw that Sandler is the Executive Producer. Mmmhmmm... It just got worse: from the most unimaginative screenplay I have heard in a decade to over-the-top cinematography (was like watching 115 minute commercial) to its caricature inmates and guards to its unbeLIEVable prison grounds... it doesn't end. Sorry, friends, stick to the original. At least Reynolds didn't take himself so pretentiously serious. Yikes. (MVP quarterback???? C'mon!)",1,2,3,3 December 2005
