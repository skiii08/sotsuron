Ford v Ferrari," Boring and irritating
","If a movie gets that kind of budget and actors, you get punished with a score of one.
This movie only made it passed the 20 minute limit 'cause I was thinking about what to watch next.
I was immediately irritated by Bale's performance, and Matt Damon's character looked flat, boring, just doing his lines while trying constantly to put on his American charming smile. 5 minutes later I was done with this movie. Too many reviews promise a thrilling experience from beginning to end, don't go in with that expectation, and maybe you'll make it to the final lap.",1,12,28,30 January 2020
First Man," They succeeded to make a big bore out of it, a typical Gosling movie
","Ryan Gosling as Armstrong... I went in with some hope that Gosling would do something else exept being quiet surrounded by spheric music in a slow paced movie with lazy acting.
Don't know why the millennials are so smitten with this guy. I remember this 'actor' strolling through Blade Runner II, and when Harrison Ford came into the picture without even saying a word, just using expression & body language, he just acted Gosling of the screen in a jiffy.There are no special effects, when he is up in the air, you just see the guys shaking in the cockpit, no outer vantage points. Don't expect to see an aircraft going through the air or a spaceship flying in space. When someone crashes, it's only mentioned. And forget about the dialogue. This movie is a typical Gosling movie (being slow, quiet & to stroll is in his contract I guess), not a good nor spectacular biopic on N. Armstrong from '61 to '68. I gave it up after 1h10min, went home and played The Right Stuff.",3,0,1,14 December 2018
Darkest Hour," 5 only because of Gary's acting
","The movie covers a few weeks of the life of Churchill during the start of the Blitzkrieg on Western Europe. And it's all seen through the eyes of Churchill, the War Cabinet and his environment.
There is some pace in the movie, but since it covers just a short period in time it's like time stands still, and that for a 2 hour movie.
Also, Churchill wasn't a likeable person, and looking at him cursing and shouting, I had enough of it after an hour.
I understand why Gary Oldman got an Oscar for imitating Churchill, but the movie itself is a bore.",5,2,5,18 March 2018
Bird Box," It's a good movie, best watched when you're in a serene mood.
","I get the haters of this movie. It's that kind of spectator that wants an answer to everything in detail, therefore the comparison to 'The Happening'.
But if you start slapping with titles I can throw in 'The River Wild' or 'Deliverance' too but in a drama sci-fi way, and also driven by good acting and not by special effects.
This movie has entertaining dialogue, is very well acted, has pace and suspenseful scenes. The blindfold thing isn't a major constant, yeah, you see everybody's faces almost all the time.It's not the happiest of movies, but still mainstream enough for a lot of people to enjoy. Hey, it's Sandra Bullock, even more light or fresher than in 'Premonition'.",8,26,67,17 December 2018
Justice League," Great fantasy movie, good entertainment
","This movie grabbed me from the beginning to the end. Nice relaxation for the mind, not every movie has to be something to think about.
There's a lot of variation (different worlds, hero's,...). There's room for comedy and the action is very well spread throughout the movie.
The bad guy is a bit childish, and also the flash has something goofy, but that gets evened out by the seriousness of the Batman f.e.
In the end it's a movie for whole the family to enjoy.",8,3,8,11 February 2018
Dunkirk," The Despair, flirting with boredom
","I went in expecting a movie about the bloody and massive retreat of the English but instead the film makers just put a bunch of guys on the beach some props and bad effects, the movie is very very slow and boredom for the viewer is always around the corner.
So why do I rate it 6....I gave it a 6 because of the musical atmosphere that actually made the movie watchable. After 20 minutes in I really started to feel the expression of despair of disbelief after the Blitzkrieg. How could it be the Germans just overran us...
So if you don't like the music after 10 minutes, shut it down, because you will not enjoy this movie, you'll find it cheap and boring because almost nothing happens. People waiting on a beach, a pilot in the air and some guys on little boats.I guess they wanted to create a sort of art movie, capturing a feeling but it was just not good enough. I don't regret I payed for it (my wife does) but I will never watch this movie again.",6,0,1,11 January 2018
The Shape of Water," Artsy Fart
","This movie is a total bore that tries to be clever and artistic but it fails miserably.
The char's are not likeable, the retro/noir decors don't work, personalities are too strange ore flat with a tic, and so the story can't keep your attention, it's even irritating (I started talking to my wife about other mundane things).
On the 20 min. mark my wife and I wanted to leave but then they showed the 'aquaman' for the first time. So we gave it another 10 minutes, and then we did the right thing; don't waste more time on this failure...",1,12,33,1 March 2018
Creed II," Worked better than the Rocky version
","I just went in without any other info than the fact I liked Creed a lot.
When I saw from the beginning it was kind of a rehash of Rocky vs The Russians, I tought, oh nooooo... Because I really don't like Stallone's original version.
But he/they made it work. Ok, it is American propaganda again, but the drama line is so much better. Not too heavy, not too light. Yeah, the movie takes you in and is very entertaining.
So I forgive the big USofA message, a solid 8 from Europe!",8,1,2,2 March 2019
