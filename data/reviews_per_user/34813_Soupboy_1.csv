The Rock," The best movie I have ever seen!
","Despite the fact that I have seen 'The Rock' approximately 40 times, I still love this movie every time I see it.  This movie has everything, a lot of action, great acting, good special effects, and a great plot.  Nicolas Cage did a wonderful job playing the dorky scientist who ends up being the cool scientist in the end.  Sean Connery made a great come back as the repentant prisoner who realized the right thing to do.  And, Ed Harris, the wrongful, renegade marine who realizes the right thing to do after it's too late. Overall I would give 'The Rock' a 10 out of 10.",10,1,1,15 January 1999
