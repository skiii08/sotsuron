Hereditary," Deeply disturbing; a film for families
","In a modern cinema climate where horror never makes me feel anything, Hereditary made me feel too much. The first 40 minutes had its share of mild, escalating creepiness but then BAM! The game changed, and nearly took my head off with it. *cluck* I would ask 'what did I just watch?' except I'm pretty sure I just watched the best horror film I've seen in years, and one of the best I've ever seen, period. This is a lot to say for the genre, but all the performances were bone-chillingly believable, the pace of the story devastatingly deliberate, and the development of events satisfyingly macabre. It's a strong 9/10 for a film I'm not sure I'll be able to watch again.",9,1,4,22 August 2018
Captain Marvel," Too political to be a comic book film, too silly to be a political statement
","Unsurprisingly there's more than meets the eye in Captain Marvel. It's really just a social justice warrior's wet dream about girl power, border control, racism, and of course how evil white men are. Add to that, why do the Skrulls and Kree speak English? How does a Skrull make a joke about borrowing sugar from a neighbor when that's an idiom invented by Earthlings? How are Skrulls even aware of what sugar is? I wanted to like this...it was just not possible.",3,12,18,28 May 2019
Us," Finally a film for plot-hole enthusiasts
","Unpopular opinion: this film is ridiculous. It makes little sense, it's inconsistent, unreasonable, cringe-worthy, and at times unintentionally comedic. No I'm not talking about the cheesy jokes that a family who should be traumatized still manages to utter in times of great duress, I'm referring to the poignant and dramatic moments of the film being an absolute laugh. I've seen budget-production indie flicks that were just as good as this story, if not better...simply put, it's a lot of hype over a very mediocre film.",3,42,58,24 May 2019
Knives Out," I must have seen a different movie than you did
","A great whodunit? I don't know about all that. No spoilers here, but you know exactly whodunit at the very beginning of the film- it's just the story evolves around that information, adding convoluted plot twists involving a couple other characters. The trailer makes it seem like it's some deep mystery up until the end when in reality you know exactly how the murder happens within the first 30 minutes of the film and very little changes, except the story becomes unnecessarily complicated as it progresses (they had to fill 2 hours somehow). Plenty of pointless political commentary provided as well, with the scales tipped heavily in favor of Leftist ideals, needlessly injecting opinions from the filmmakers about how Republicans are Nazis, and other lies. So edgy...so woke! What an over-hyped waste of 2 hours.",4,5,9,15 February 2020
Interstellar," The Greatest Adventure Ever Told
","A masterpiece of film-making. 10/10; will cry again when the credits roll.
Instant classic that became even better upon my second viewing, which inspired this review. It's been out for 4 years now and there's over 3,000 reviews on this film, mostly positive, so I can't write anything now that hasn't been written already on it. If you haven't seen it, and you somehow find my review among the many out there, please please please do yourself a favor and watch the most exciting, heartbreaking, passionate science fiction story ever told.",10,2,3,23 August 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Wasted potential
","This one doesn't deserve a long review and I am not one for describing the entire film in my reviews, so I'll keep it short & sweet.Story- Complete waste of potential, with opportunities for unforgettable character redemption gone before you can even finish daydreaming about the tasty possibilities for them. Acting- I like Frances McDormand a lot in other films but what has been praised as her finest hour, is to me, a grueling exercise in overacting, needless spunk, and unreliable character depth. I don't get the hype about her performance here. Woody is as great as always but I still don't care for the story surrounding his character, and he seems overall pointless to the plot when it's all said and done. Sam Rockwell is the best part of the film, hands down, but the wasted potential (see above) of his character is the biggest failure of the entire project. I watched this because a family member wouldn't shut up about how great it is. After giving it a chance, I don't even have the heart to admit I ever saw it...and quite frankly, I'll probably soon forget I had.",4,6,9,19 August 2018
Baby Driver," Tries Hard To Be Stylish With Its Unorganic Indulgence.
","I hate to be the guy who gives 5/10 stars to everything that looks nice but lacks in substance, but it would be tough to rate it any better or any worse, so I'm truly stuck in the middle.I can certainly see why this movie has received praise from the audience it's meant for, but as some other reviews here have remarked, it's kind of a boring affair overall.I can't deny the soundtrack, though, which is more enjoyable to me than the way Guardians of the Galaxy pt 2 seems to force its soundtrack in our faces. The way the music is used is impressive and fits naturally with events on screen, regardless of many of those events not being engaging enough to keep me from daydreaming about my personal life while the film plays on before me. The music hitting at the right time was really the only thing ripping me out of my own thoughts and back into the narrative.Those who are excited by car chases, sunglasses, trendy styles & simple dialogue need apply. If you aren't into that stuff, then maybe the music will save you too.5/10; will expect multiple sequels.",5,153,274,18 October 2017
The Favourite," Pointless, pretentious, & painful
","The title of my review says it all. Perhaps I'm not the target audience for this film but I am baffled at how this could be nominated for Best Picture. I mean what is this movie even about? A sickly, homely queen having lesbian sexual relationships with her weird chamber maids? That's about it, and it's stretched into a painful 2 hours. My theory is that 2018 was a weak year in film. This film, Blackkklansman, Black Panther, Roma, & Vice were all filler nominees for Best Picture. There were only a few worthy candidates, and The Favourite couldn't possibly be considered for the award in a better year for movies.",3,3,8,26 February 2019
Green Book," Superb
","This is about as good as it gets for drama- particularly about this period in American history. I so rarely give 10/10 ratings on here; many people give them out like candy just because they like a movie, even when it's not an amazing film. Green Book is an amazing film. It's nominated for Best Picture at the time of this review, and though I think the Academy Awards is a wank, this film deserves to win Best Picture, and it could win it any year, regardless of its competition. Powerful, convincing performances by the cast; amazing storytelling; and deep, resonant moments that cannot easily be forgotten after the credits roll. This film and the events it is based on can be lessons for any generation.",10,1,3,21 February 2019
Annihilation," Unnecessary Filmmaking
","I don't normally enjoy nonlinear films anyway, and when I have, it has to be truly engulfing to rival how disjointed the story is. Annihilation is an example of a film so disjointed and jarring, that I truly believe the sole purpose of its creation is to frustrate viewers. I liked nothing about it, but I give it two stars for atmosphere.",2,1,6,19 August 2018
The Martian," Hollywood Cheese
","The once great Ridley Scott continues to disappoint in a film for Matt Damon enthusiasts who enjoy crowd-pleasing silly dialogue & gooey, touching moments with accompanying music that helps you know when you're supposed to feel something. Bring him home? Eh...seems like a lot of work & I'm sure in reality NASA wouldn't bother. And neither should you.",4,4,6,22 August 2018
