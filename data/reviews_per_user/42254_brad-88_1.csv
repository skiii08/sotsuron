The Blair Witch Project," Blair Witch is more boring than chilling
","I was disappointed in this movie after seeing it.  It is a very unique film, and its ability to actively involve the audience through 'real' film footage is brilliant, but it lacks momentum and thrills.  The chilling aspect of the movie just isn't that strong.  The ending of the movie is very disturbing, but not all that shocking.  In fact, it is rather predictable.  The amateur nature of this film, while it does give the audience a strong sense of reality, is also the film's weakness because between the so-called frightening scenes is a large lull that consists of little more than constant arguing among the characters.  While the arguments are sometimes humorous, they also get tiresome very quickly.  This film is far above most horror films in terms of style, plot, and acting, but could and should have been more chilling than it was.  An audience's imagination can only go so far.  I would still recommend this movie, though, because it is a unique film experience.",6,0,2,6 August 1999
