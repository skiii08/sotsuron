","BEST!EVER!PERIOD.Just like most truly brilliant pieces of art, explaining why they are great is almost moot.  I could write for hours, but in the end Gestalt Theory prevails: the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.This movie is what made me appreciate film as an art form and to devote my life to watching them. Whatever flaws people may say it has only add to its strength because they don't matter. It's magic would be lost if anything was changed. Most modern-day film fans are too arrogant to acknowledge this film among more popular contemporary classics, but the truth is that only a few of them even come close.Love it. Hate it. Whatever. Either way you will respect and bow down to its glory.",10,3,5,6 April 2002
The Matrix," Overrated, overrated, overrated!!
","'The Matrix' is a decent and entertaining movie that is only viewed as something more than that by those who haven't seen better.The story borrows heavily from other films and tries real hard to convince it is more than your average sci-fi/action movie.  It's not.  Keanu Reeves' acting is better here than in anything he has done before or since, but that's not saying much.  He does not make a good leading man and is easily eclipsed by the supporting cast (mainly Laurence Fishburne).My suggestion is if you want to see The Matrix then see it and enjoy it, but then go out and see far superior movies like '12 Monkeys' or even the 'The Cell'.",4,7,15,22 March 2002
