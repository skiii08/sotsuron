Scarface," FAB with a Bad Attitude
","Tony Montana is a FAB with a bad attitude and big enough cojones to make yours drop dead. All his life he has been looking for an opportunity which he finds on the streets of Miami. To him only time stands between him and the world and soon he goes right through the top. Money, Power, Respect, he gets it all only to learn that the hard part is not getting to the top but staying there. Pacino really gives everything he's got in this one and makes the part so his own that one can't help but wonder whether this movie would have been this good if it was someone else playing this role. Rest of the cast do their job really well also, especially Steve Bauer as loyal friend and partner Manny Ribera. The score is just as gangster as the story and there is uncountable amount of classic lines which i already mentioned a few here and there. Between the lines however this is a story about so many things besides selling drugs and killing people. What i love about this film is that it's message is whatever you make it out to be. On one side you can say it almost implies that you have to be ruthless and get what you want because no one's gonna give it to you. On the other side it shows so effectively how sooner or later the consequences of our careless actions catch up with us. It gives a brilliant multilayer message and lets you do the choosing. After all a message is only as good as it's receiver. This film will never get old. In a way it's a film about all of our lives because everyone can watch this film and relate to it whether you are rich or poor, young or old, i'm not sure i should say male or female. Anyway it's #1 in the genre mayn and it's a Masterpiece Chico!",10,1,2,3 September 2008
The Fountain," A Revelation!
","It's not just a movie, it's a revelation. This film explores the emotional and spiritual highlights of a human life ever since we came to, all the way where ever we may go to. The story is about timeless topics like life, death, love, faith, hope, all which conjure big emotions that are brilliantly expressed by both Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. But the biggest star of the show is the Writer/Director Darren Aronofsky for trying so hard to bring this enlightening experience to us. This movie almost never got made twice and it did even worse at the box office but in time, like The Shawshank Redemption, people will understand it's value. For those of you looking for a movie that's meaningful buy this film and embark on this timeless philosophical journey.",10,11,19,2 September 2008
The Matrix," THE Sci-fi Masterpiece
","My favorite film and i don't think it will change for a very long time. If you've never seen it run to the store and BUY it. But if you're the type that likes doing other things while watching a movie then don't watch it. I really love this film and can't stand to see low ratings just because people didn't sit there long enough to understand it. To me when I first watched it i couldn't get enough of it. It was so creative and interesting that I didn't want it to end if there is such a thing. I was addicted to it for like a week. They never should have made those degrading sequels. I hate them. I wish I never watched them. How could you make the most brilliant movie and follow it up by two dumb ones. Well that's what happens when you add bunch of unnecessary crap so you can divide them into two movies. Don't these directors have any sense of responsibility to the fans. Is everything about money damn it. Oh yeah, it is.",10,0,1,1 September 2008
Heat," A Heart Stopper
","I'm not kidding. I'm 23 and every time the bank scene comes i still feel my pulse riding. I wouldn't recommend it to people with heart problems. First of all, who ever doesn't think this is a masterpiece knows very little about films. I'm sorry but it's true, I read some of these Hate-It reviews and man i gotta to say, to put this movie down is a crime to art in general. wait wait. A genius story, complex characters, great score, all star cast, a bank robbery scene to put an end to all bank robbery scenes, and Michael Mann directing it all. I probably missed a lot more but the point is if you're into the crime genre and haven't seen this film you're not into the crime genre. If you are not into the genre then you will be only never to be this satisfied again. 'Don't get yourself attached to anything you can not walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you spot the HEAT around the corner.' Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! i'm gonna keep on saying it till' you do, Buy it! Buy it! Well, just buy it.",10,2,4,3 September 2008
Goodfellas," A Film to Amuje All
","The best mobster film in my opinion. I love the Godfather but this is just so much more fun to watch. When I mean fun I mean I can't take my eyes off this fn thing every time it comes on or someone's watching it. If there is one movie that never ever ever ever gets boring i would have to say that it's these guys the Goodfellas you know. There's nothing to really say about this film i mean you just have to see it, I'm just writing 'cause I want the score to show up on MY MOVIES over here. It's entertainment at it's very best. You want a true story Goodfellas, you want crime Goodfellas, you want clever jokes still Goodfellas. The only downside is, after watching this film, you really get this urge to join the mafia and live a life of crime, you know, be a Goodfella.",10,0,0,3 September 2008
