Mission: Impossible III," i underestimated this movie
","To my surprise, this was actually very good. better than the second one which was so bullcrappy. i wasn't intending on going to see this, but my friend begged me, and, still thinking this will be a mess, i agreed.ethan hunt, (tom cruise), an IMF leader is retired and works on training new agents and stuff because he's getting married. he's called back to duty and faces an arms dealer, phillip seymour Hoffman and tries to keep his identity secret to protect his fiancée.the first 5 minutes were good. they show u a part taken from the middle of the movie that interests you. but after that, they show us ethan and his girlfriend at a party celebrating their engagement. u can already smell some cheese right? well, only when their are together. i thought those loving scenes were really cheesy and could've been better because the director just did a bad job at it...but the elsewhere, the movie was very good. the action and special effects were spectacular. the helicopter chase scene was so cool, there are lots of explosions and running and shooting that keeps you at the edge of ur seat. though, the movie doesn't have the edge of the first movie, doesn't have the gadgets and will be forgotten sometime in the future just like the second one where there were no cool gadgets and legendary moments. but nevertheless, i found this movie to be far greater than i expected. the performances were especially good. bravo to michelle monoghan (ethan's fiancée),who did, in my opinion, the best out of the cast. the movie also has many twists that i really liked. u might think something, but then ur proved wrong. that's really cool.when u think of it as a mission impossible sequel, it feels out of place, but when u think of it as an individual action movie, it's fairly good. if ur not such a movie judge and just looking to have some fun with some friends, this is ur movie. otherwise, if ur gonna be a total roger ebert and judge every second, then don't waste ur time. but i found this movie to be well worth my $7.50",7,7,13,4 May 2006
