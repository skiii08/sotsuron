Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Powerfully unfunny
","I went to see the movie based on the rave reviews on IMDb...now having seen it, I'm surprised it has such a high rating.I was not offended by anything in the movie, just found the humor to be predictable and boring. Nothing really clever, unexpected, or interesting. I'm picky about my humor, I will fully admit. But I'm not above mainstream humor. I love Seinfeld, Scrubs, Arrested Development, Adult Swim...but this did nothing for me.I had a similar reaction to Wedding Crashers and Anchorman, which lots of people seemed to like. So, if you liked those two, you'll probably like this one. I was definitely in the minority of people in the theater...most were laughing I think. But I rarely even mustered a smile or chuckle.",1,23,48,4 November 2006
