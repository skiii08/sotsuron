The Lobster," Quick Review
","'The Lobster' is a Movie about love and society! Is a dark comedic tragedy made in the context of the Greek Weird Cinematic Wave and it's a masterpiece of the silver screen.
The acting is absolute perfect for what it must be, but the ultimate protagonist here is Lanthimos's mesmerising Original Screenplay. So, If you are willing to Take an obscure view on society and it's basic pieces, this is your movie!",10,11,19,22 August 2018
First Man," Quick Review
","Chazelle's new movie isn't as good as 'Whiplash' and 'LaLaLand' were, but it most certainly deserves your ticket money.The biggest problem of the movie is the script, which is pretty bland and cold and typical. But the amazing performances by Ryan Gosling and most importantly the absolutely terrific Claire Foy are there to save the film.Also, the amazing cinematography and score helps the movie to not stuck from time to time and the final 30 minutes are just the purest cinematic experience of the year.Go out there, find the movie and watch it! It is not the best movie of the year, but it is one pretty much great!",8,3,5,3 January 2019
Hereditary," Quick Review
","'Hereditary' is an Art House Thriller-Horror with absolutely zero jump scares and a slow but (if you pay attention to the details) unbelievably great build up for the finale!Yes, as you probably already have seen you either love or hate this picture and I can truly understand both sides. It's weird, it's different and if you miss some of the details (which is incredibly easy to do) you might not be able to enjoy the terrifying final scenes!I recommended it to everyone that isn't seeking for a Neon-Thriller (like most of them from 2000-ish and after), but for an old type one!",9,4,7,2 October 2018
A Star Is Born," Quick Review
","With a near to perfection performance by Cooper and a pretty good by Gaga this is an acting movie as much as a music one.The technical aspect is a majestic peace of cinema work. The sound mix and edit, the color corrections, the cinematography are all top notch, and of course Cooper's direction is all over the place (positively taken).The weak spot of the production is its script. It is not a bad one for sure, but it is an 'unstrong' one. Especially, for the last 40 minutes is all over the place (negatively taken), with it being rushed for the grand finale.I totally recommend this one to any cinefil out there and I truly hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did, if not more!",8,1,3,4 January 2019
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Quick Review
","Although funny and quotable, seeing 'Life of Brian' for the first time in 2019, isn't that unforgettable experience that everyone used to have back then. Yes, it is a good comedy with a pretty clever script and a big dose of irony, but it doesn't really age well.If you are into satire and you are ok watching an 1979 about blind faith (religious, political or anything else really),t hen this is your movie. If you are not into everything of those combined, then 'Brian' isn't for you!",7,1,2,3 January 2019
Alien: Resurrection," Quick Review
","I have, literally, no idea why this Picture has that high Metascore or IMDb Audiences Score! I can understand that my '2' grade might be hard for some, but still! The movie is around '5' at its best and way below '0' at its finale! I cannot find not one redeeming quality for the 'Resurrection'! It's not the bad-good or laughable bad film that you can enjoy with a company or alone, if you are in the mood! It's plain bad and hence Score!Stay to those first films...",2,3,5,17 October 2018
Deadpool 2," Quick Review
","I will always love the movies with Hollywood-Businesses jokes and 'Deadpool 2' is full of them. Though it's a funny and fast Picture, the overall meta-vibes are in cases way too many and makes the film looks heavier than it really is.Quickly, I didn't love it as much as I loved the first one, but it was a perfectly nice follow up and it made me waiting for the next one!",7,1,1,9 September 2018
Sleepy Hollow," Quick Review
","Oh! Look there... its' a Tim Burton and Johnny Depp collaboration!Sleepy Hollow was a great film, but has lost much of its magic with the passing of the time. It's still pretty good though.The number of Hollywood's legends working on this Pictures is just mesmerizing and one of the main reasons that it works. The make-up its also exceptional and (a long with the rest of the Picture) pretty much underrated.I cannot recommend it enough, if you are seeking for a movie to pass your time. It has its horror and thriller elements, its romance and the 'Family - Non-family' tone that Burton's is amazing at!",7,1,1,28 September 2018
Bird Box," Quick Review
","As a great fan of the 'A Quiet Place' i was watching this film having in my thoughts that it is the exact same premise, but this time they have a problem with the eyes.As the movie progressed, however, I found myself not just intrigued by the production, but deeply lost inside it. Yes, it is not as perfect of a script as 'A Quiet Place''s was, but it has some great performances by Bullock, an amazing cinematography by Salvatore Totino and an overall good score.For sure this is an absolute recommendation for me.",7,1,4,4 January 2019
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Quick Review
","Even after M:I 3 and M:I Ghost Protocol (both directed by favorite directors of mine) I wasn't there for the franchise. But this one! This one made me love the series.The action was just amazing, the performances by everyone were top notch and the music was out of this world! The only thing I didn't love was the character of the 'bad guy' but even that one wasn't bad!Totally recommend this one to any cinefil out there and especially to anyone who likes action!",9,1,1,8 January 2019
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Quick Review
","Brad Bird's take on M:I, is a fan, fast, funny and action packed thriller. The camera work of 'Ghost Protocol' is exceptionally good and manages not only to take some amazing shots but also transportes the emotional height of the Picture.The action, although over the top, it's mesmerising and that's in par with Tom's performance. Overall, the acting it's ok (with its highs and it's lows), but the script is pretty weak and even cheesy from time to time (especially the last scene)!",7,1,2,20 December 2018
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Quick Review
","First of all I would like to mention the best about this movie.It is indeed a very good looking film. The cinematography and the costumes are absolutely amazing and very close to the atmosphere of the decade that the movie takes place. Also Vera Farmiga gives and amazing performance. She is by far the best this movie has to offer. Also good (of course) was David Thewlis but here is the first big BUT about 'The boy in the striped Pyjamas'...The British accent of Thewlis and not only ruined a very big amount of the film cause felt so out of place! I understand that this was a BBC production, but again! Thewlis playing a Nazi was way Britisher than it was acceptable!My last BIG bad point about the movie is the music! The score is absolutely out of the spirit! In the first scene with the same happy tune that it presented the German Kids go over to the poor Jewis... and in the closing scene, Jesus! Nothing emotional in a very good scene!that's all for me!!",6,1,1,11 September 2017
Cold War," Quick Review
","Pawel Pawlikiwski's 'Cold War' is one of the best movies I've seen this year. The two lead performances are plain amazing and really felt like they were in a great love romance and a hard experience overall.Moreover, the music in the Film (Score and Songs) are out of this world. I'm constantly listening two 'Two Hearts' in every version and language and you just cannot miss this one.The one and only problem that I had with this move was the framing. Yes it was unfocused to show that the protagonists weren't an the front center and to give depth to the story and picture, but in the end that was a gimmick that I don't really believe that worked.",8,5,12,7 January 2019
Big Fish," Quick Review
","'Big Fish' has a great twenty minutes finale that will melt your heart and will make you ugly cry. But also, it has a weak script for its 2/3 that could easily confuse any viewer that isn't paying attention very closely to the Picture!Overall, I recommend for every fan of Burton's work or for those who want to see a cute family movie!",8,1,1,4 October 2018
Singin' in the Rain," Quick Review
","'Singin in the Rain' is a classic Hollywood Picture being both an omage to (the even more) classic Hollywood and a satire of it!Is one of musical's best, but even though some of the songs have stood the test of time, the overall tone might be a bit slow or unpaced for some.",8,2,2,26 August 2018
La La Land," Quick Review
","It is true that Musicals are my sweet spot and La La Land is no exception! It is indeed one of my absolute favorite Movies of all time. The songs are memorable, the two lead performances are just out of this world, with Emma and Ryan having an amazing connection and chemistry and the overall camera work and direction being one of the true masterwork of the year!La La Land is everything its name said and the exact opposite. It is where you can find love and all your dreams becomes reality and it is also the sad finale, a nightmare, a bad moment in life.If you haven't seen La La Land yet, do yourself a favor and catch it with the first chance!",10,4,5,12 January 2019
Super 8," Quick Review
","J.J. Is one of my favourite working director and this film is a perfect example why.'Super 8' is a great homage to classic Spielberg films (especially ET) but in a pretty honorary way and not in a 'let's just copy him' way!It is a teen drama, a sci-fi fantasy, a growing up story and all of these performed in the most sweet acting that you will see (lately) from children and you will feel every emotion!100% recommended from me",7,3,5,8 January 2019
Rio," Quick Review
","For every good music piece, there is an atrocious pop song. For every emotional hit from the script, there is one stupid/bad decision made from the protagonists. And so one, and so forth.So 'Rio' is a perfectly just fine movie, that any children will enjoy and every adult will not cry for watching, though there are better things out there for everyone.PS: The animation has great movement and the colors are absolutely wonderful!",6,1,2,3 January 2019
Beauty and the Beast," Quick Review
","If you let yourself enjoy a live action remake of a classic Picture, you will actually pretty much like (if not love) this movie.Yes, the CGI isn't first class always and in many cases is a point-to-point copy of the old one, but still The Disney Magic is all over this Film. Emma Watson is Incredible, the voices are perfect matches and the new elements made the story even more emotional and sweet.A great spectacle and a family movie 100%!",9,3,4,12 September 2018
The Wolf of Wall Street," Quick Review
",I wasn't even aware that I could hate someone so much!From a filmmaking perspective the Picture is a masterpiece. But I truly cannot stand there. I disliked DiCaprio's character and friend so f' hard that I surprised my own self and that's everything I can think about 'The Wolf Of Wall Street'!,8,2,3,27 August 2018
The Conjuring," Quick Review
","'The Conjuring' is artistically as good as it gets! James Wan delivers an astonishingly well crafted film with exceptional cinematography, music and acting.It's indeed a story told over and over again, but it's the overall quality of the Pictures that makes it unique among the 'same old horror'!",9,1,2,26 August 2018
Mary and Max," Quick Review
","'Mary and Max' is not your typical animation. The audience for it is not the children but instead very mature cinephiles! With themes like death, mental illness, friendship, parenthood, society structures and so on, it's an amazing experience that you must watch immediately!Watch out for the exceptional score and songs of the Picture!",9,4,6,23 August 2018
The Truman Show," Quick Review
","'The Truman Show' is a unique film about the television obsession (or - as a true allegory - any kind of obsession) and the limits that people seem to leave behind when they're talking much about profit. Human dignity, law, any type of principals are pretty much dead during the first half of the film. Alongside Truman of course, the movie make you realise all the above and highlights the unfairness of the case.The Picture's end where the two guards just change channel after just a second of the end of a 30-years-program, seems to only give more emphasis to the moral of the whole film!'The Truman Show' is a masterpiece and a MUST watch with friends or family!",9,2,2,17 September 2018
Warcraft," Quick Review
","Though 'Warcraft' has nothing special, one has to admit that it has nothing bad either! It is by the book, with a script as simple as it gets, but there has been effort for there to be a story and not any big plot hole!The CG isn't bad and the orca are pretty fun to watch! I recommend this one to everyone that just want to pass it's time with fun",6,1,1,18 October 2018
Beetlejuice," Quick Review
","Beetlejuice is a different family movie, that requires a pretty much grown up family or those ones that are into horror films. Its quick, its unique and above all its hilarious and lovable as hell!Tim Burton's stop motion is extraordinary yet again (surprising no-one) and the overall performances are from pretty good to great! The Sylvia Sidney cameos are probably the best parts of the movie. She has by far the best lines. Also, Michael Keaton is great, but Alec Baldwin and young Winona Ryder have a more normal role and managed to be memorable as well!",8,2,3,28 September 2018
