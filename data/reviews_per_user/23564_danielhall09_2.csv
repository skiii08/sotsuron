Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The movies 'very nice'
","This movie written by the makers of the Ali G show is about a guy Borat who leaves Kazakhstan to see what life is like in America. When in America though, things don't turn out quite as planned as every were he goes bad things seem to happen which leaves him looking like a complete idiot. Things become even worse in the movie as he falls in love with Pamela Anderson and tries to find a way of making her fall in love with him by kidnapping her. Eventually though things are so bad that he decides to leave America and go back home.This movie that in fact real(not all acted) is shocking as you see what jerks some people in America are when they are confronted with Borat.Borat acted by 'Sacha Baron Cohen'(Ali G)is hilarious all through the film and will leave you with stitches in your side.If you like the movie then i believe you will like the Borat t.v show which is on the Ali G show",9,0,5,6 February 2007
Coach Carter," education comes first
","New Richmond basketball coach Ken Carter, is fed up of his new team not caring about their education, so the new coach decides to lock up the school gym and cancel all their matches until they concentrate on their classes. The sport's drama film directed by Thomas Carter and wrote by Mark Schwahn and John Gatins is a brilliant inspiring film that has it's ups and downs as the boys start to realise that education is important, especially for one boy as the boys start to realise that education is important, especially for one student Timo Cruz (Rick Gonzalez) who gets kicked out the team once and walks out on the team as well. But it wasn't long before he gets back into the team, after turning up at ken carter's door crying after seeing his cousin shot and promises he'll do anything to get back in the team.",7,0,0,31 January 2007
