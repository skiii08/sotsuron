Minority Report," Weak movie with too many holes in the plot.
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** This review contains spoilers.Minority Report causes me to once again ask:  Can anyone make a good action movie?  Minority Report strived to be just that, but it has holes in the plot so big you can drive a truck through them.  Some of the plot holes I found in the movie are listed below:1. In 52 years, is human slavery going to be considered acceptable?  The movie contains three `pre-cogs' who are being held against their will, in a drugged state, being tortured with nightmarish visions, and nobody seems to care.  Even when Tom Cruise is running around the city with one of them, he is treating her more like a tool to provide information than a person. The movie should have dealt with this issue in some way.2. If police are currently tested for drug use, and drugs continue to be an issue in the future, then how could Tom Cruise's character John Anderton be a cop with a long time drug addiction?  In addition, if his character has an any common sense, why would he leave drug paraphernalia all over his apartment?3. When Tom Cruise's character is pre-identified to commit murder, why is it a brown ball (the murder is premeditated) rather than a red ball (impulsive crime of passion)?  Before he enters the room, he knew nothing of the victim, and he suddenly learns of the individual's alleged link to his son, and shoots him out of anger (according to the pre-cogs).  He has less time to plan his actions than the character who almost kills his wife and her lover early in the movie, but that one was a red ball (or double red ball to be more specific).4. If the Pre-Crime Director Lamar Burgess wanted to commit murder, why didn't he just get the victim out of the Washington D.C. area?  It would have been much easier and less risky to arrange a meeting in some other city.5. The movie centers around the idea of pre-crime being taken nation wide. If there are three pre-cogs, and they only seem to be able to see murders in their own area, then how are they going to take it nationwide?  There may be a logical explanation for this, like expanded human slavery, but the movie doesn't show it.6. When the John Anderton character removed his eye bandage early, why didn't he go blind?  The movie repeatedly stated that if he removed the bandages before 12 hours were up he would go blind, but that didn't seem to happen.  Since the bandage was removed from one eye, and he retained one of his original eyes, I expected a tie-in, but that would have required a little forethought on the part of the producer/director.7. When the eye surgeon performed the operation, why did he keep talking about how John Anderton ruined his life, and how he was going to return the favor, only to do nothing in revenge?  A moldy sandwich doesn't exactly make up for years of abuse in prison.8. If Speilberg makes a point showing that the pre-cogs can see murder, but nothing else, how is it that when running around the mall, the pre-cog knows everything?  Even the mother of pre-crime emphasized that it was the pre-cogs nightmares of murder that came true, not that they could tell everything in the future.9. If Retinal scans set off alarms wherever John Anderton went, then how could he and his wife continue to use his removed eye to access the most sensitive areas of law enforcement without setting off a single alarm?10. Automated cars and plants that attack people have been used in movies for years, and in 152 years it may happen, but I don't think it will happen in just 52 years.11. How sappy can an ending be?  I was waiting to see the Mickey Mouse ears on the characters before the end sequence was complete.  I know Steven Speilberg is known for happy endings, but this one goes a little far.I don't know if Steven Speilberg is no longer capable of seeing holes in the plots he creates, if he is too arrogant to ask the opinion of others, or if he feels that a big glitzy movie with Tom Cruise makes up for a substandard plot, but Minority Report is a weak movie dressed up in blockbuster clothing.",3,6,11,1 July 2002
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Shallow film about shallow people aimed at those who believe they are deep.
","The only redeeming thing about this film was the acting. Unfortunately, most of the actors do a little too good a job convincing you how pathetic their characters can be. I do not need to watch shallow people at their shallowest to make me feel deep. I haven't seen such self indulgent tripe aimed at wannabe intellectuals since Lost in Translation came out.Anyone who gave this film a nine or ten needs to spend a little more time at small theaters that play independent, documentary, foreign, and art house films so they know the difference. If you happen to live in the south Puget Sound area you should check out the Tacoma Grand Cinema.",3,7,18,12 May 2005
Titanic," A waste of time
","A shallow movie about shallow people in deep water.It is a shame that any comments require ten lines of text. This movie doesn't deserve that many lines. I will go ahead and type until I am able to submit my comments, but I hope nobody is still reading this. If you have bone beyond the first line, you are wasting your time, just like you would by actually watching this movie. Here is a synopsis, The girl lives, the guy dies and the ship sinks. Oh, and there is a weak love story involved. The only thing I can add is that the stupid old woman should have left the rock on the deck of the ship and thrown her own sorry a$$ over the edge of the ship.",3,3,5,30 January 2009
V for Vendetta," Takes itself WAY too seriously
","Not a terrible movie, but not very good either. It is the typical liberal program film where the government is evil, homosexuals are put on a pedestal, and religion is evil. The biggest problem with the film is not this one-dimensional approach, but rather that it conveys a feeling of moral superiority because it takes on these 'deep' issues.If you have a couple hours to burn, there are worse movies to watch, but I wish I hadn't wasted my time. It simply takes itself much too seriously. The only way I would recommend this film is if you are a big fan of someone in the film.",5,6,15,19 March 2006
