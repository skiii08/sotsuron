Lucky Number Slevin," A delightful cat's cradle of a movie
","Everything is connected, what more can I say? Pay close attention and watch the Kansas City Shuffle take shape, twisted thread by twisted thread.This is a movie buff's, cult sort of movie, not an ordinary Joe's six-pack and bag of chips sort. The sets are ugly. They have found some of the world's most horrifying wallpapers and room dividers for a thank-God-never-was sort of 70's yuck! feeling. I think the set designer should get a prize for extravagant awfulness. Excellent actors who bring warmth and depth to precisely limited roles. The dialogue is laden with clues and irony. 'It's what they called back then a drugstore handicap.' Whole movie right there, but you won't notice until 3 am in the morning of the night you watched it. The sort of movie you watch a second, third and fourth time with increasing pleasure as you see how it all fits together.",8,1,1,13 June 2015
City of God," Has everything- philosophical depth, suspense, film-craft. It's a 10.
","A whole lot of people die in this film, and they are not the weightless, clean, entertainment deaths of your average adventure, action or crime flick.They are real-world deaths. Pointless, tragic, bloody and disgusting. Meaningless beyond being a reflection of the constraints and conditions we humans create in some places, in interaction with the wide span of human personalities that must live in them. To put that better- deaths that occur, just like in the real world, because some few people see killing as the answer to business competition or emotional dissent and the wealthier society around them finds it unnecessary or even undesirable to stop the killing since it is happening to 'worthless' people in the slums, or as in this case, the specially constructed residential area for the dislocated poor.But the movie is fantastic. Those dead people, before they die, they live vibrant, meaningful, realistically textured lives. The film is gorgeously shot. The script and story structure are the work of skilled craftsmen and left nothing to desire for me. It seems to me to be a brilliant study of humanity and society, and every bit as hopeful as hopeless. That pulls it up into great art.This is one of the very few movies in the world that I look forward to watching again for the sheer pleasure of watching it unfold, even though I know what it's about, where it's going and where it will arrive.A classic.",10,0,2,2 February 2007
