Angels & Demons," Angels and Demons
","With 'Angels and Demons,' a film about Professor Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetra's race against the Illuminati to save Vatican City from an anti-mater bomb that could wipe everyone out, proves once again the Ron Howard is not the great film-maker many people say he is. Take just the beginning of 'Angels and Demons.' We see currents of electricity move up wires, but big deal. That special effects trick has been shown so many times before that it seems boring and repetitive now. The other scene, which shows director Howard showing off, reveals the floor of the pool so that we have an idea what it is like for Professor Langdon (Tom Hanks) to swim under water. But again, do we really need to know? We can just as easily to go a swimming pool and find that out for ourselves. There is also no character development in 'Angels and Demons.' Langdon (Tom Hanks) and Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) are the same people at the beginning of the film as they at the end, in spite of all the tumultuous things that have happened to them. The same is true for the villains in this story. There are also certain flaws with plot development of this film, especially toward the end.Yet at the same time, 'Angels and Demons' is not a bad film. It imitates some of the best scenes in the Steven Spielberg Indiana Jones series: studying of archival sources, opening tombs, and watching Langdon get himself dirty while going through a secret passage way or sneaking through a vent. In short, this film is very good at showing the wonder of going into strange places and discovering new things. This side of the film, in many ways, compensates for its flaws such as those illuminated above and makes 'Angels and Demons' entertaining right up to the end.",7,1,2,4 April 2010
Black Swan," Black Swan (2010) - Review
","Director Darren Aronofsky's 'Black Swan' is easily one of the most intelligent, over the top, uncompromising, riskiest, no hold's bar films made in 2010. This is the kind of film that forces the audience to think about what it sees up front and also about is subtly conveyed in the smaller scenes that infer a much bigger and disturbing picture. The most interesting thing about 'Black Swan' is ballerina Nina's (who is played brilliant here by Natalie Portman) sudden and rapid transformation as a person (which has been delayed for more than a decade). As she comes closer to owning her own life, she hastens her own terrible destruction. It is incredible to watch. I do not know of any film deals with its same subject quite in the same way as 'Black Swan' and conveys it with such raw uncompromising power.",10,0,2,21 February 2011
Sucker Punch," The most expensive (and pointless) film about a scavenger hunt
","'Sucker Punch' has to be the most expensive movie ever made ($82 million in all) about a scavenger hunt. Babydoll (played by the really sexy Australian actress Emily Browning) gets sent into an asylum by her really evil dad so that she does not inherit her mother's property. While in the asylum, Babydoll teams up with Rocket (Jena Malone who gave a far better performance as the teen love interest in Donnie Darko), Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens of High School Musical fame), and Amber (Jamie Chung) in planning their great escape. Naturally the film also has villains, like the psychopathic Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac) and Dr. Vera Gorski (Carl Gugino doing a very bad Polish accent).I personally like the first 5-10 minutes of the film with the 80s soundtrack in the background and Director Zack Snyder showing off his computer-induced cinematography skills and the last 20 minutes when they are escaping. But everything in between was quite bad. The first big problem I have with this film is the plot. Apparently this insane asylum is very difficult to escape from and you would think, therefore, that Babydoll would respond to this challenge by coming up with a very clever and original escape plan that could catch all the guards unawares. But Babydoll's escape plan, far from being grandiose on the scale of Clint Eastward's in 'Escape from Alcatraz' (an escape film with far more excitement on a much smaller budget), is as mind numbingly simple as getting a map, a lighter, a knife and a key and then busting out. Apparently the girls will all steal these things, while Babydoll keeps the guards distracted with a strip tease. The only thing that was more ridiculous than the plan itself was that the other four girls thinking that it was such a brilliant idea. While I concede that great escape plans usually have at least a whiff of implausibility (though this one really takes the cake for implausibility), the problem with the escape plan in 'Sucker Punch' is that it's so basic that watching this plan unfold is a lot like watching paint on a wall dry. Moreover, the screenplay writers were unable to imbue the escape scenes in 'Sucker Punch' with suspense, with the result that the audience is given no reason to care if the girls got out of the asylum or not. The next point, in relation to the plot, is that I do not think Babydoll knows how to dance, because otherwise why substitute her dance scenes with CGI video game action scenes featuring samurais with machine guns (obviously Snyder does not know much about Japanese history), inflatable Germans (talk about being xenophobic), and a big dragon? If Babydoll is such a sexy dancer, then her dancing would have easily upstaged the video game sequences (which were below average program fair) and Snyder could have saved tens of millions of dollars on the CGI.My next criticism is about the music. Aside from that 80's number in the beginning, Sucker Punch's soundtrack is terrible. I don't know when people concluded that noise could be music, but the makers of this film must have seen the wall-to-wall noise accompanying the action sequences as a thing of beauty because it pervades this film from beginning to end. The lyrics are boring and the noise that comes with it is boring. Finally, many critics point to the bad acting in this film. But I think this criticism is irrelevant because the film would still be bad even if the actors were good. There is no way to deliver good performances in this film, because the plot and the dialogue are so terrible. There was also criticism that Sucker Punch is an exploitation film. Admittedly there is some exploitation, but that criticism is a bit overblown. I have seen films that are far more shamelessly exploitative than 'Sucker Punch.' The main problem with Sucker Punch is not that it is an exploitation flick mixed in with a disingenuous 'strong woman' type of message, but rather that it's just a bad movie.3.7/10",4,2,6,5 January 2012
Marie Antoinette," Marie Antoinette (2006) -- Review
","Usually, I can watch a movie to the end. But in the case of Marie Antoinette, I failed miserably in the attempt. If 'Marie Antoinette' is not the dullest movie in existence, then the directors who have come up with worse should be utterly ashamed of themselves.I don't care if a movie, like Marie Antoinette, is not historically accurate. What I do care about is when it does not give us anything of interest to hang on to. Kirsten Dunst's Marie Antoinette comes across as a ditsy teenager, which may entertain some people, but frankly I met so many ditsy teenage girls in my time that I can do without seeing a film about one. Jason Schwartzmann makes a terrible Louis XVI, because all we see is a clueless king. The real Louis XVI was more interesting and complex than the one in the film. He was a product of his own age. He tried to solve the financial crises of his own reign by appointing one minister after the other. But these ministers failed, because they faced outdated Feudal structures, like the provincial parlements and the office-holders, which thwarted any attempt to reform the tax system; reforms that could have generated more revenue and helped solve the financial crises. Rip Torn, who is best doing comic roles, is miscast as Louis XV, a king who in reality is far more complex and far more interesting than Sophia Coppola makes him out to be.But unfortunately the problems don't end there. The different accents (which results from the film director picking an all-star cast and allowing them to speak in their own accents) clash. The excerpts with rock n'roll make the film an awkward experience. It is almost as though film director Sophia Coppola (who also wrote the screenplay) wanted to create a period piece and a contemporary piece at the same time. But since the 18th century was obviously a very different from the 21st century, the result is a jumbled film with fits and starts. What Ms. Coppola should have done was to make 18th century France understandable to her audience -- just as her father Francis Ford Coppola made the secret underworld of the Mafia understandable to his viewers. But that takes a special talent, which I am not sure Ms. Coppola has.It does not help that the film lacks a real plot. First, we wonder whether the wedding between Marie and Louis XVI will succeed -- we wonder, but we don't care, because neither character establishes a connection with us. After the answer to that question is given, we see a disjointed plot with gambling scenes, Marie playing with her children and Louis XVI doing some state business. Finally, the French Revolution sends everything crashing down. But again who cares? The reason why the plot does not work is not simply because it is disjointed and we do not care about the characters, but rather because the events that come to pass on film are not given any meaning. Ms. Coppola could solve that problem in many ways. Perhaps, she could even portray France as it was in the 18th century. A France locked into the Feudal age, in spite of the monarch's pretensions for being absolute. A France that had a hodge-podge of different laws for different provinces and even different towns, resulting in a legal system that was so unequal, so confusing and so unfair that the revolutionaries made a single law code for the whole of France one of their key demands. But these issues are not discussed. Louis XVI's approach to these problems was glossed over. And we do not really understand why the idyllic world at Versailles suddenly came crashing down.Obviously a lot of money was spent on the sets and costumes, but it seems to be such a waste considering what Sophia Coppola finally came up with. I rarely bring environmental issues into a movie review. But if you are going to pollute the planet and wreck the delicate balance that exists between human beings and nature, then at least don't come up with trash like Marie Antoinette. Indeed if Hollywood did not make bad films, they would be doing the environment a big favor.",1,22,38,15 March 2009
Star Trek," Star Trek
","Owing to the six Star Trek movies and the voluminous Star Trek series that have come out over the past few decades, it is fair to ask whether the latest Star Trek movie (which starts this story all over again) has anything new to show us. What director JJ Abrams has demonstrated with this film is that the answer is a definite yes. There are many things I like about this new Star Trek. To begin with, the film looks great. I have grown really tired of the fake-looking CGI that George Lukas employed for his last three Star Wars movies. So I was pleased when J.J. Abrams actually presented us with realistic looking images. The spaceships look like real spaceships in space. The planets with alien monsters look like real planets with real alien monsters and not something designed by a computer. Compared to Lukas' last three Star Wars pictures and Peter Jackson's gargantuan insects in King Kong, the alien life forms in this movie are constitute a remarkable technical achievement.The other great thing that Abrams, the producers and the writers did in this movie was to make the characters more human. Chris Pine's Jame T. Kirk, for example, is a lot more interesting that the stock character that most Trekkies grew up with. On the hand, this movies' Kirk is a dare-devil and a bad boy who often gets himself into a lot of trouble and is a bit of a lady's man. On the other hand, Kirk happens to be brilliant and has natural leadership skills, though the question of whether this potential will be realized is by no means certain. Zachary Quinto's Spock is also more developed than the old Spock in the sense that he is presented as more human and flawed and not simply as a caricature nerd. Moreover, Spock is shown to have more empathy as demonstrated by his ongoing relationship with one of the crew. By doing this, it is now possible to relate and sympathize with Spock.Finally, I found the story to be quite interesting for the first two-thirds of the film. The last third is more problematic. To begin with, this film drags on for too long and could have been trimmed by 30 minutes or so. The other problem with the new Star Trek is that it falls into many of the sames traps as many Hollywood films do. What strikes me is that in a futuristic age, the best that the writers could come up with is a mundane and quite boring physical confrontation between James Kirk and the evil Rumulin at the end. Then there are the pathetic celebratory scenes at the end which come from the same Hollywood mentality that was behind 'Independence Day' and '2012.' Since most of the beginning of the film was quite good, I would have to attribute the last third to a case of writer's block and innovation fatigue. It is regrettable, because the set up was quite good and the story was quite interesting most of the time.6.5/10",7,0,2,11 October 2010
Kickboxer," Kickboxer - review
","Without going into too much detail, 'Kickboxer' follows the same formula as Rocky IV and, to a lesser extent, the other Rocky pictures and the Karate Kid films. Yet I found this film to be a lot of fun despite its predictability. Jean Claude Van Damme (playing the hero Kurt Sloan) is not a great actor, but his youthful exuberance, cheerful demeanour, and dashing appearance make him a very likable hero nonetheless. In addition, Van Damme is also not held back as much as in his later films when he goes through the indignity of saying fewer lines than the supporting cast. For me, the decision not to hold Van Damme back is a good one, because a hero can never hold our interest unless he has a well defined character to go along with his martial arts moves. Yet the best character in Kickboxer has to be Xian Chow (Dennis Chan) who trains Van Damme for his big fight with Tong Po (Michel Qissi). Xian Chow was obviously modelled after Mr. Miyagi from the Karate Kid movies, but his character has a few fresh elements. To begin with, Dennis Chan projects a dry sense of humour, like when he explains to Kurt Sloan why it is unwise to train a stranger in the art of Muay Thai. This movie was sold on its martial arts sequences, but the truth of the matter is that Dennis Chan steals the show whenever he performs on screen.The rest of Kickboxer consists of Van Damme's Kurt Sloan going through intensive training against a gorgeous backdrop of Thai architecture and great 1980s music, which is just as well since training sequences in an exotic martial arts form and amidst Ancient Thai architecture are reliably entertaining. This film, especially its training sequences, also has a subtle statement to make on life which was very much in keeping with the spirit of the 1980s. This statement, simply expressed, is that the route to success and lasting happiness is to suppress troubling emotions, pull yourself up by your bootstraps, and work incredibly hard to overcome adversity. Those people who fail to overcome adversity in this way only have themselves to blame.",7,0,0,27 December 2011
Hostel," Hostel -- Review
","The infamous 'Hostel' is about two teenagers (Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson) and their Icelandic companion (Eythor Gunjonsson) traveling across Europe in search of women for the most basic reason: sexual intercourse, of course. They end up in Slovakia where they get exactly want they want. However, they soon discover that the endless sex is too good to be true, because the girls intend to lure them into a particular nasty trap that makes all three men into torture slaves for this underground 'Hound' network.Now some reviewers have given this film very high ratings; others have called it utter trash. The truth lies somewhere in between. The first half of the film was actually very good. Director Eli Roth (who also wrote the screenplay) succeeds in building up the suspense and you get a strange feeling that things are not what they seem. Aside from that, the viewer beholds some lovely cinematography of Slovakia.But once the dark secret of the film is revealed, the film descends into the familiar monster fest of blood, gore and body parts. Now some people like that, but frankly I don't. This is one of those movies that uses torture, blood and gore not to advance the film's plot in a meaningful way (much like Eastern Promises did), but simply to entertain viewers by shocking them. These horror tactics have gone on for more than three decades now, perhaps the most infamous example being Caligula. But frankly it takes more than cutting off fingers or pulling an eye from its socket to create a good film. In other words, the problem is that the plot exists for the sole purpose of serving the film director's sadistic fantasies. It would have been much better (especially if much of the gore and blood was edited out) if the sadistic scenes actually advanced the plot (as they did in Hitchcock's Psycho, in The Godfather parts 1 and 2, Scarface, or Dressed to Kill). Instead, what the viewer gets is a pile of sadistic trash. Aside from that, the film is very offensive to Slovaks and Slovakia in general.",4,1,3,15 March 2009
The Other Boleyn Girl," The Other Boleyn Girl: A Rulebook for Serious Films
","'The Other Boleyn Girl' is one of those films that is so boring that you start picking out the logical errors with the plot. To begin with, Henry VIII's private life has been the subject of countless films. Unless a movie can provide a fresh take on this familiar subject matter, then there is no point in making it. Yet aside from this criticism, 'The Other Boleyn Girl' also suffers from the fatal flaw of being stupid. The beginning of the film sees Henry VIII (Eric Bana) impregnate Mary Boleyn (Scarlett Johannson) with a son. You would think that Henry VIII would then divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry Mary, thereby legitimizing his son's eventual succession to the throne. Yet for reasons that are not at all clear, Henry VIII acts like the cad who who breaks off all contact with a girl he had just impregnated rather than a monarch who is desperate for a male heir. So even within its own logic, this film breaks down.If this is not bad enough, we have an even more illogical episode to follow that one. After spending a pleasant holiday in France, Anne Boleyn comes back to England with a mission to seduce the king. But her plan is to treat Henry VIII like dirt and be snobbish and obnoxious to everyone else. Of course, I do not hold any of these things against Anne necessarily because it is nice to see the titled aristocracy getting taken down a couple of pegs. Yet what does not make sense is that Henry VIII would marry her afterwards, especially considering that there is no chemistry between them whatsoever. I also do not understand why Anne Boleyn was devastated when the king lost all interest in her. She did become queen after all and it was not as if she was in love with Henry. With this many illogical scenes, Anne's deep seated anguish comes across as forced rather than sincere. The film makers asked Natalie Portman to cry a river and she cried a river for them. At the end of watching 'The Other Boleyn Girl,' I came to the realization that this movie should have been made into a soft-core sex comedy of the 1970s variety. The execution scenes can be cut, extended sex scenes with Scarlett Johannson can be inserted, and the dialogue can be lighter and feature more sly wit and humour. That way, this film will not have to live up to its unrealistic pretensions to greatness and can be a rousing entertainment.",3,5,7,19 February 2009
The Last Song," The Last Song - A Review
","To begin with, I usually do not like Miley Cyrus' movies because she is too boisterous, too in your face and too silly. But in 'The Last Song,' they toned all of that down and the result, quite surprisingly, was a film that I actually enjoyed. 'The Last Song' is not perfect. Miley Cyrus, who plays Veronica, is not yet ready for roles that require depth of emotion. Take the scenes where her character is angry with her love interest Will (Liam Helmsworth) or is meant to be devastated on learning of her father's (played very well by Greg Kinnear) cancer and you will see what I mean. Nevertheless, in those light hearted scenes, Cyrus' Veronica is as likable as she is entertaining. It is this good natured, occasionally funny and always warm spirit, conveyed by Cyrus' Veronica, Helmsworth's Will (who is most believable as the cool, likable guy, but less so as the troubled one), Veronica's dad (Kinnear) and brother Jonah (Bobbly Coleman), and a couple other characters, that makes 'The Last Song' work. In fact, I think if they edited that part out about the father having cancer, the director and producers would have an even better film on their hands.As a final note, this teen movie also has wonderful redemptive qualities. There is a scene early in this movie where Will is offered sex by Ashley (Melissa Ordway) who explains that her parents will be out for hours. But Will turns her down because he is not in love with her. What an unexpected and refreshing development: a teen making adult decisions about his own love life! In another scene, Veronica gives a poor girl Galadriel (Carly Chaikin) money because her nasty boyfriend Marcus (Nick Lashaway) threw her out and she has no where to live. Then there are other scenes where Veronica and Will sort out their problems through communication. These scenes are not completely believable, but their morale is undeniable - namely that many misunderstandings can be avoided if two people, who are in love, talk about their problems and how they feel. There are many adults I know who have not picked up on that insight. And I could keep going on. Suffice to say, at a time when so many 'teen' films are sexploitative and degrade their characters(particularly the horror flics like 'Fear Island' which tries to get by on sex and gore), it is refreshing to find a film that has the confidence to move beyond that and to actually elevate people who are not perfect, but have the potential to become better human beings when given the chance. It is also refreshing to see a film that has the ambition to portray some teens as adults making adult decisions that affect their own lives and the lives of the people around them.So 'The Last Song' is not perfect film. But there is enough good stuff here for me to recommend the film. 6.5/10",6,2,7,9 February 2011
The Duchess," The Duchess
","My main fear before I saw the Duchess was that this was going to be another feminist movie about a 'strong woman' in the 18th century. I was glad to discover that it wasn't. The Duchess of Devonshire Georgiana (played surprisingly well by Kiera Knightly) was an intelligent woman who was interested in politics, had ideas of her own, and had this refreshing ability to speak directly, a quality that was mirrored by her lover Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper). Yet Georgiana was not a strong woman. She was powerless against the things that life as a woman did to her. When the Duke (Ralph Fiennes in another great performance) wanted to rape Georgiana, he got his way because this is a society where a man of high rank enjoys almost absolute power -- especially over women -- and does not have to account for his deeds and misdeeds. When the Duke wanted to take on mistresses, he did so with impunity. When the Duke wanted to force Georgiana to separate from her lover, he succeeded by threatening to take away her children. 'The Dutchess' in a phrase is dark, explicit and uncompromising portrait of aristocratic power in 18th century England with a very clear message: for women, independence and civil rights were an illusion. The glimmer of hope, of course, was that some of the women were making timid requests for greater independence for the first time.This is not a pleasant picture by any means, but it is so well acted and so startling accurate that we actually feel empathy for people, like Georgiana. And that means something, even for a picture like the Duchess whose plot is no more complicate than repeated acts of submission. A brilliant film.",9,1,1,15 December 2009
Quantum of Solace," Quantum of Solace - WTF!
","Quantum of Solace was obviously made for Bolivians only, because they are the only ones who are going to care about its plot - which involves a villain Dominic Greene trying to corner 60% of Bolivia's water supply so he can force the new Bolivian government to pay top dollar for it. Dull right? Yeah, absolutely right. But that's not the only problem with Quantum of Solace. Mark Foster and the producers got the main villain Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric) all wrong. The best kind of villain for a Bond movie is very eccentric (if not insane), has a sinister looking face, could be a bit of a nerd, has a black sense of humour, does incredibly evil things that you would not expect (like dump a woman in a river of piranhas), and usually has a great master plan which he is just aching to reveal to the hero James Bond. And usually the makers of James Bond get this villain down to a tea: take Dr. No in 'Dr. No,' Blofeld in 'You Only Live Twice' and 'For Your Majesty's Secret Service,' or Francisco Scaramunga in 'The Man with the Golden Gun,' or Renaud in 'The World is not Enough' and so on. But Mathieu Amalric as Dominic Greene is just too dull, too nice and too prissy to come across as even remotely evil. As for the other bad guys, they are an embarrassment to evil people everywhere. I personally think Osama bin Laden, Dick Cheney, George W. Bush, Pervez Musharraf, Islam Karimov, Omar Bashir and Robert Mugabe should file a law suit against the producers who made this film for making them look bad by putting them in the same category as Dominic Greene.The other problem with this movie is that it is really only about chase scenes. Car chases, running, motorcycle chases, plane chases, more running... a bit monotonous and tiresome, don't you think? This movie has more chases than 'Live and Let Die' and 'the Man with the Golden Gun' put together and that's an achievement. But not an achievement to be proud of, because there is no room for, let's say, a much better plot, great Bond dialogue, sexy scenes with centre-fold women (in fact, the only scenes I enjoyed in this entire Bond film involved James Bond (Daniel Craig) and the sexy red head Strawberry Fields (Gemma Arterton), though I am not quite sure when they started finding each other attractive), and interactions between the villain and Bond.Finally, I think the director got James Bond wrong. Daniel Craig's personality is so icy that his charisma evaporates; he makes Roger Moore look like Alfie. I realize that this was how Daniel Craig is supposed to play Bond and he does it very well. But at the same time, an openly cold and unsympathetic personality does not work in the context of a fun Bond film (Casino Royale was different, because it works as a serious Bond film). James Bond always had a shadow over him, but he also knew how to tuck it away when he was seducing women. We do not see that kind of Bond here and I think that is a mistake.",4,5,7,31 December 2009
Twilight," Twilight -- A Review
","Twilight does not have much of a plot and yet it is a pretty decent film. The main reason why I say this is because the on screen chemistry between Bella Swann (Kristen Stewart) and Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) is positively electric. Kristen Stewart does a great job as Bella Swan who loves the vampire Edward Cullen to the point of obsession. You can see her feelings for Edward beaming from her face. In fact, everyone of her reactions from beginning to end comes across as wholly sincere. Now some have criticized this film for bad acting, but really if you compared Kristen Stewart's performance to that of Drew Barrymore, Kate Hudson, Tatum O'Neal, and Mandy Moore, Stewart puts all those women in chick flicks to shame. As for Robert Pattinson, he too is brilliant as the socially awkward and troubled Edward Cullen who feels he has a terrible secret to hide. Roger Ebert observed in his review that this film is really a metaphor about a teenager who discovers how hard abstinence is. He is right, but Pattinson's character is more complex than that. Edward Cullen is also ashamed of being a vampire, because society sees vampires as monsters, and he tries repeatedly to appear normal in front of Bella Swan only to fail every time. Cullen is a repressed vampire much in the same way as some people are repressed homosexuals, and Pattinson does a really good job in showing that side of Edward.Now the film is not perfect. After Bella discovers who Edward is, the film seems to run out of ideas and has to tack on an unnecessary scene with bad-ass vampires at the end. But in its presentation of a love story, this film is unique. I personally have never seen a love story involving thanatophiles before and presented with such sincerity that you can easily take it for the real thing. I was personally curious at one point about whether there was an off-screen romance between Pattison and Stewart (there wasn't). To say that this film is worth watching would be an understatement. Sadly, if the plot could only have been improved, Twilight would have stood a good chance of becoming a masterpiece in addition to a cult favourite (which undoubtedly it has become).",7,1,4,31 October 2009
City of God," City of God -- One of 2002's greatest films
","'City of God' is a masterful film about the criminal world of one of Brazil's most notorious slums. 'City of God,' as the name suggests, was sold as a paradise to Brazilians whose former homes had been destroyed by floods and acts of arson. But this slum turned out to be a purgatory on earth and eventually became a burning inferno filled with violence and grinding poverty. This slum also served as a microcosm for a cynical policy of moving the poor and their problems away from the more prosperous urban areas and then forgetting about them -- unless, that is, the level of crime and violence really got out of hand. 'City of God,' aside from its highly original camera work and musicality, is also a brilliant piece of story telling. This film not only has wonderfully constructed, multi-dimensional characters, but it also puts these characters in exciting, dangerous, funny, and often unbelievable situations. We can predict that many of the Brazilian kids and teenagers, who begin a life of crime, will eventually come to grief, but we cannot anticipate how or under what circumstances they will meet their fate. In addition, this film also pays unusually close attention to human nature. To take just one example, the subtleties in the friendship between self-styled boss of the 'City of God' and drug lord Lil Ze and Benny (both played brilliantly by Leandro Firmino and Phellipe Haagensen respectively) are fascinating. Lil Ze is obviously a psychopath who kills and maims people with his gun almost on impulse, but the most intimate and enduring relationship in his life is with his friend Benny. As a result, Benny is often able to use his friendship to steady Lil Ze and prevent him from losing control completely. Another example is how Goose acts as a kind of father figure to Rocket, telling him never to touch his gun, while he continues his life as a hoodlum. These character studies are far more complex and interesting than the cardboard characters that come straight off the assembly line in most Hollywood films. Moreover, this attention to human nature reveals the countless little details that make us empathize with the characters in the 'City of God' to varying degrees, regardless of whether they are good or bad. As a result, this movie is much more than just entertainment; it teaches something about slum life, crime, and the human condition. 'City of God' is one of 2002's best films.",10,1,3,27 September 2014
Django Unchained," Django: a mixed review
","Director Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained is certainly the most original story, set before the American Civil War and the emancipation proclamation (1863) that freed the slaves, about two unlikely bounty hunters, Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz) and former Django (Jamie Foxx), who spend the entire film hunting down and killing white southerners who broke the law. Yet this film's strengths are matched by its weaknesses, leading to only a marginal thumbs up for me.The strength of the film is partly in Christopher Waltz's delicious performance as Schultz who deftly combines great civility with truly sociopathic behaviour. In retrospect, it is a shame that we did not get to see more of Waltz and less of Foxx in this picture. Leonardo DiCaprio also delivers a brilliant over the top (but regrettably short) performance as the villain slave owner, Calvin Candie. There is a certain irony in the fact that Candie calls his estate, 'Candyland,' given how horribly the slaves in particular are treated there. DiCaprio, who is obviously a gifted actor when given rich parts, creates a character that is flamboyant, unapologetically sadistic, and displays incredible energy. He is a marvel to watch. Beyond that, director Quentin Tarantino also should be credited for making a film that, in the first hour or so, has a sense of humour about the farcical situations that its characters are in while, at the same time, using graphic violence to illustrate the savage racism of the ante bellum South. Doing both those things at once without appearing in bad taste is something of an accomplishment.Yet this film has significant weaknesses as well and its third and final act in particular was a disappointment to me. To begin with, Jamie Foxx is actually quite boring as the main character Django, which would not be so much of a problem except that the whole film is about him. Far from doing anything interesting with this role, Foxx can only regurgitate his slick, charismatic performance from films, like 'Stealth.' So when the camera is just on Waltz or DiCaprio, I did not really miss Foxx. Another problem was Kerry Washington's performance as Django's 'wife,' which has to go down as one of the dullest performances of a love interest in the movies. Finally the other major flaw in 'Django' is that its plot, especially towards the end, becomes too farcical and too absurd. The film's third act plays like an exploitation film, using very graphic violence and bloodletting to entertain rather than to underline the savagery of racism and slavery. One wonders whether Tarantino lost his inspiration by the time he completed two-thirds of the script and simply tacked on an ending that exemplified the tired and worn out formulas for other action pictures that use graphic violence to jolt the audience.",6,1,2,25 November 2013
2012," 2012: -- Review
","Rolland Emmerich's 2012 is not a perfect film. The uplifting music inserted at the end is stupid. Moreover, you won't find any sympathetic characters, except perhaps the chicken whose head pokes up when she realizes that she might escape beheading. But you know what? 2012 is a lot of fun to watch.Here's why. First, the special effects which cost $250 million are great. Everything is destroyed, including Michaelangelo's ceiling at the Sistine Chapel. Second, the premise works because of course we want to know if Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) and his family are going to survive the end of the world. But that's not the only reason why I like 2012. Unlike most disaster films, the director, the producers and the writers did something clever: they did not rely on special effects alone. They recruited good actors and gave them fun characters to play. Take Woody Harrelson's cameo as the conspiracy nut who (as it turns out) was absolutely right about almost everything from the suspicious deaths to the date when the world ends. Oliver Platt is also wonderful as the amoral Carl Arnheuser. When deciding who to save from the apocalypse, Carl reflects that his wife never wanted to see him again. Well it does not take a genius to figure out what happened to her. And I can keep going on.Finally, even the scenes that don't work are funny. For instance, Jackson Curtis is introduced to us a loser who does not hesitate to take his children to the now dangerous Yellowstone Park, even though he is warned against this by a newly erected gate and a restricted sign. 'Don't you read the signs,' his son says. And yet, Jackson is apparently a brilliant driver. How else can you explain how he is able to navigate through falling buildings, a collapsing freeway and god knows what else without crashing the car once? This guy can give James Bond pointers. And what about Gordon (Thomas McCarthy) who, in spite of having only two days flying experience, can navigate a plane -- which has Jackson Curtis and his family -- through skycrapers falling at both ends and a whole host of other catastrophes, again without a single scratch. Either this guy had a great flying instructor or he possessed a natural gift for flying ever since he was a fetus in his mother's womb. Lastly, I could not help overlook the fact that President Thomas Wilson (which was obviously modelled on Obama) was surprisingly old. Maybe, the economic crisis, the heathcare debate, the Afghanistan war, the Iraq war, Gitmo, pirates and now the end of the world placed such a strain on this guy that he ended up aging prematurely in a big way. Even his daughter was not immune because in three years she went from being 10 to 25.Now I don't want to spoil the rest. Suffice to say, if you want a fun night out with your friends after drinking a few beers, go see '2012.' You won't be disappointed.",7,1,4,16 November 2009
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Thumbs down for New Moon
","Kristen Stewart once called herself as a 'professional liar' when referring to her performances in movies, like Twilight. The problem with 'New Moon' is that the performances of Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattison, Taylor Lautner, Anna Kendrick and others are so obviously a lie that it is nearly impossible to believe in any of them. In this respect, New Moon is a very inferior film to the first Twilight which, for all its flaws, at least had believable characters and a believable love story. The main reason for this major flaw in New Moon is that the script lacks compelling dialogue. Most of the dialogue, especially in the beginning, is absurd; and the actors know that their dialogue is absurd because they give the consistent impression that they do not believe in what they are saying. So the result is a superficial vampire movie. But the problem with 'New Moon' goes even deeper than that. The plot is not really interesting. For most of the film, Bella is meant to be depressed after her break up with Edward Cullen that is never properly explained. But Bella never succeeds in establishing a connection with the audience - not least because the Kristen Stewart voice-over sounds so fake - and therefore watching her depressed is a boring experience, instead of a touching one. There is a somewhat interesting part of the film with the wolves, which in my view really do upstage the actors. But the part with the volturi, who are meant to enforce a rather rigid set of vampire laws, was done completely wrong. If the film-makers were smart, they would have done something unique and original with the set, like create a whole new vampire world hidden from human civilization with its own unique look (why do vampire buildings have to look like human buildings, for instance?), culture and way of life. Instead human beings can see the volturi simply by walking into an elevator, clicking the basement floor - how unoriginal (what happened to secret passages) - and then walking into a throne room that looks like a baroque cathedral from a tourist guide. The volturi themselves, moreover, are not that scary, even when they do come close to killing Edward Cullen (I really stopped caring by that point, because I wanted an early end to this film). Martin Sheen is miscast as the head volturi, because he lacks the stature and command to make that role work. Sheen was much better in 'Frost/Nixon' because in that film he was supposed to be a mousy interviewer who seemed way over his head financing and carrying out the interview of President Nixon. Perhaps Frank Langhella would have made a better volturi or Eva Green. But Sheen is all wrong for the part. The same is true for the other actors attempting to look scary as volturis. The female volturi, for instance, looks like one of those part geeky, artsy theatre chicks one meets while attending the fringe festival. Of course, the script does not give the volturis much to do or anything interesting to say. So these actors are also hamstrung from the start. Overall a disappointing film. Thumbs down. The other sad thing about this film is that Graham Greene, who was so brilliant in 'Thunderheart' and 'Dances with Wolves,' is in this film, but the film-makers only gave him a bit part instead of utilizing his considerable talents in full. What a sad day when a great actor's potential is not exploited to make a bad film, like this one, somewhat better.",3,5,6,28 July 2010
Pawn Sacrifice," Pawn Sacrifice -- A Review
","The best movies are those where the filmmakers do their research. Director Cronenberg and Christopher Hampton clearly care enough about the psychiatric practice in order to study it carefully and skillfully weave theory into the lives of the characters in the movie, 'A Dangerous Mind.' Darren Aronofsky, likewise, clearly did his research into the inner world of professional wrestling in order to make his film, 'The Wrestler.' As a result, 'The Wrestler' not only had compelling human stories, but we also got to understand what the lives of some wrestlers were really like with their drug use, the male camaraderie, and the physical stamina involved in one bruising fight after the other.Yet with 'Pawn Sacrifice,' we get the sense that that Director Edward Zwick, the three screenwriters, and the producers are not really interested in learning anything about chess – despite the fact that this movie was about the only American to become World Chess Champion, Bobby Fischer. Instead, 'Pawn Sacrifice' is solely a character study on Bobby Fischer (played quite well by Tobey Maguire) with his personality quirks and bad temper, but divorced from his chess. For instance, there are a few scenes where Bobby Fischer defeated Soviet grandmaster Ivanov. Ivanov then withdraws from the tournament by claiming that he came down with influenza. Fair enough, but how was Fischer able to defeat Ivanov? And what made Fischer's chess victory any different from the victories which other grandmasters had over Ivanov? The film does not answer these questions, because it does not even bother to take the time to explain the chess game to us. I also have the same complaint about Fischer's victory over Victor Korchnoi. Korchnoi was a master at defence and counterattack and one of the strongest grandmasters in the world by the late 1960s. So how was Fischer able to beat him? Again, this question goes unanswered, probably because the filmmakers and producers assumed that the game of chess was too boring to be worth explaining to anyone or they were not particularly interested in Fischer's unique genius for chess, which inspired a future generation of Soviet chess players like Garry Kasparov. Yet if they really felt like this, why make a movie about Fischer at all? The reason why neglecting to explain Fischer's chess games is such a big flaw is two-fold. To begin with, Fischer's brand of chess is what made him so unique and extraordinary -- not his moods or his wild conspiracy theories. Yet judging from the film, I do not yet see how Fischer's chess was any different from Soviet grandmaster Ivanov's. Second, Fischer sacrificed everything, including his sanity, to achieve a mastery over his unique craft which no one else had. So shouldn't we get a clear idea of how challenging professional chess is? Should we not be given a clear idea of the hurdles Fischer had to overcome in order to become world champion? And also why achieving this level of mastery over chess was so important that Fischer was willing to sacrifice as much as he did? These are also questions that this film has not addressed.'Pawn Sacrifice' does have its strengths. All the performances are pretty solid, especially Tobey Maguire's as Bobby Fischer. We get to understand this man's inner demons, his intense sensitivity to noises and lights, his paranoia and anti-Semitism, and his eccentricities. These aspects of Fischer are of some interest to us, since they foreshadow his eventual and tragic psychological breakdown. Yet 'Pawn Sacrifice' can hardly be considered a great film, largely because the filmmakers seem as clueless about Fischer's chess genius (which I assume is a hugely important component of the film) as the young woman who took away his virginity in California.6.5/10",7,5,6,31 May 2016
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," One of the Ten Best Films of 2009
","'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is probably one of the most daring and original films ever made and easily one of the ten best films made in 2009. This is a film with several different plot lines - one about a very gifted, but anti-social and violent, outsider named Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) who eventually triumphs over amazing odds, another about a brilliant and gutsy journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nvqvist) who takes a chance on a daring story, loses his reputation and liberty and then searches for a comeback, and another about a millionaire Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube) who, before he dies, wants to find out who murdered his daughter Harriet - that all come together in surprising, original and creative ways. This film is also a murder mystery which is so complex and profound that it is engrossing to watch Blomkvist and Salander work together in trying to solve it.What I find remarkable about this movie is that Swedish director Niels Arden Oplev and writer Nikolaj Arcel are able to take all these different plot lines and create a uniform masterpiece out of it with great cinematography (and there are some really good images in this movie) to boot. And yes the movie lasts for 2 hours and 30 minutes, but I can say unequivocably that this film is so interesting that I did not notice those 150 minutes go by. Furthermore, the performances in this movie are incredible. Noomi Rapace brings to her performance an intellectual brilliance and frenetic energy - as evidenced even by the little things like smoking one cigarette after the next or the abrupt way she interacts with others - that makes the character Lisbeth Salander fascinating to watch. Michael Nyqvist is also wonderful as the journalist Blomkvist who develops the most unexpected, but nonetheless believable, relationship with Salander. But even my assessment here does not give this film its proper due. I feel like telling everyone don't ask me about the plot and don't ask me about the characters. Just watch the movie and experience it for yourself. I would recommend 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' to anyone, except to those under the age of 18 since they are likely to be very disturbed by the graphic scenes in this picture. This is a film for adults. Thumbs way up.",10,5,10,1 September 2010
Ip Man," Ip Man delivers the goods
","I was not expecting anything too special from 'Ip Man' (2008). After watching countless martial arts movies with Steven Seagal and JCVD, I was convinced that this genre could not offer anything new except a worn out formula plot and some special effects-generated martial arts sequences. After all, Steven Seagal movies are not creating the same kind of buzz that they did when 'Under Siege' was in theatres.Yet what a difference good acting, a fine script, and a great soundtrack makes. Donnie Yen (who plays the martial arts master Ip Man) is not only very good at martial arts, but he is also a brilliant actor. Yen delivers a completely believable performance as the martial arts master who loves his family and lives his life according to Confucian principles, but then becomes so enraged by Japan's wartime atrocities in the late 1930s that he takes revenge against the Japanese. In addition, Yen is joined by other actors who are just as talented, such as Hiroyuki Ikeuchi as the malevolent Japanese general Miura (who grudgingly admires Ip Man) and Tenma Shibuya as his sadistic, cowardly sidekick Colonel Sato (who, in my opinion, is an even nastier villain than the general).The plot in many ways resembles past martial arts movies, but also contains several fresh elements. To begin, 'Ip Man' focuses considerable attention on human nature, including Ip Man's close relationship with his family and friends. As a result, the characters in 'Ip Man' come across as multidimensional and authentic human beings rather than as cardboard personalities. We even end up caring for the characters in 'Ip Man,' which is why we understand Ip Man's feelings of rage against the Japanese (for killing a few of his friends). This movie also features a big fight right at the end. I have big fights before in the Rocky movies, the Karate Kid trilogy, and the Bloodsport films, but this one is more exciting than all them. I think part of the reason why is because this movie achieves the rare effect of making us understand why the big fight at the end matters so much to Ip Man and his arch nemesis General Miura. Lastly 'Ip Man,' in addition to being great entertainment, is also a nationalist picture and arguably anti-Japanese. The first scenes with the Japanese are deliberately manipulative. The Japanese soldiers' faces are not shown as they shoot down unarmed Chinese civilians. Yet crucially the faces of the victims are in full view. Scenes like these are designed to make the audience sympathize with the Chinese, while viewing the Japanese soldiers as less than human. Another scene with strong nationalist connotations shows Ip Man telling General Miura defiantly, 'I'm just a Chinese man.' A loud drum beat is heard in the background to emphasize this reply as simultaneously an act of defiance and national affirmation. Yet although Chinese nationalism and anti-Japanese bias are fully exploited here, these elements do not undercut the film. Only right at the end, when the narrator's words are beamed on the screen, does the nationalist propaganda truly get silly -- though fortunately those sequences are in the last two minutes of the film.",9,0,0,2 November 2014
Friends with Benefits," 'Friends with Benefits'
","'Friends with Benefits' has a predictable and unoriginal rom-com storyline and its ending is pretty lame. Yet this movie coasts on the charisma of Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis and a lot of sharp and witty dialogue. As long as these two actors are talking to each other or having sex, there is hardly ever a dull moment. And the reason for this seems to be simple enough. In most rom-coms, the actors play pretty dim-witted, boring and superficial people and therefore there is no reason to take interest in anything they may say or do. In this rom-com, 'Friends with Benefits,' Timberlake and Kunis play fresh, independent and smart people and for this reason we are interested in the lives they lead and what they say to each other. So 'Friends with Benefits' does not have much of a plot, but that does seem to matter because on this rare occasion we are happily distracted by the magnetism of two capable on screen actors who are playing two well-craft parts.",7,32,42,7 April 2012
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Salo
","In the 1960s and 1970s, Italian filmmakers in particular were fascinated by evil and Fascism and, in exploring this field, they produced a wealth of work ranging from Visconti's 'The Damned' to Bertolucci's 'The Conformist.' Director Pier Paolo Pasolini's last film Salo comes from that tradition, but it does not deserve to be up there with those films. The main weakness of Salo is its predictable and simplistic plot. In 'The Damned' and 'The Conformist,' the villains had ideas that gave them a sense of purpose (however misguided those ideas were), great ambitions and their behavior was so complex that they often inspired sympathy as well as enmity. But 'Salo,' by contrast, is simply about all powerful Fascists taking pleasure raping, torturing and murdering helpless male and female teenagers. This film is as much high art as the porn films about the carrying out of rape fantasies or the slasher films are high art. Salo does not make you think. Salo does not teach you anything about the human condition. Salo does not make you feel anything except incredible disgust. Salo is just trash.I usually keep an open mind about films with violence and depraved forms of sexuality. Visconti handled the violence and sexual depravity in 'The Damned' with great skill. I also regard the torture scene in 'Last King of Scotland' as masterful. But Salo has all of the depravity and violence, but none of the intelligence. The problem is not so much that Salo is incredibly violent and disgusting (which it is), but that these violent and disgusting scenes - which include cutting tongues, eating feces, public defecation, urinating in people's mouths, and rape(all done to young people depicted here as play things to these Fascists, which makes them appear even more worthless than the people who get killed in bad slasher movies)- are in aid of one of the most base and vile motives: to cause shock and to disgust. Pasolini also appears to have wanted Salo to be gay porn. Otherwise it is hard to explain why Pasolini filmed handsome bare chested male models and homosexual intercourse. Now once again, I have nothing against gay porn. But this kind of gay porn is unlikely to excite the libido of most homosexuals because it is undermined by the violence and feces eating (which the overwhelming majority of porn directors have the good sense not to put in their films). Salo will also not appeal to the overwhelming majority of heterosexuals because unlike other films that deal with gay romance, like Neil Jordan's brilliant film 'The Crying Game,' it is lacking in tenderness and humanity. If you think about it, Salo is really a self-indulgent exploitation film. Pasolini tried to show his audience that he could be disgusting and shocking in ways that could hardly be imagined and, in that respect, he succeeded brilliantly. But the film is rubbish in the most depressing and mean-spirited sort of way from beginning to end. To say that the film Salo is bad would be unfair to the directors of other bad films, like Ed Wood of 'Glen and Glenda,' Randal Kleiser of 'Return to the Blue Lagoon,' and Dolph Lungren of 'Icarus.'No Stars",1,11,24,31 March 2009
Titanic," Fall of the Titans
","Just as the ship that couldn't be sunk sank in 1910, the movie 'Titanic' which should not have failed went belly up and fell to the bottom of the sea. I seem to be going against the grain here and maybe I was the only one seeing this movie who didn't get it. I readily that there are great moments in this movie. The dramatic sequence where the Titantic ship becomes flooded with water and eventually sinks to the bottom is brilliant. What director James Cameron also does very well in exposing the sheer unfairness that some were allowed on the life boats, while others were not. In that connection, there was a emotive scene with a navy officer who, often against his own will, enforced this unfair system to the letter, not because it was the right thing to do, but because there were only so many life boats to go around and the prevailing view was that the few life boats available should go to the rich -- with the result that the rest were, in effect, left to die. What is also very good is that scene where some of the passengers are floating in the ice cold water, clinging on to whatever they could get their hands on, and quickly freezing to death.Yet, the film still does not quite work because of what preceded this sad, dramatic tragedy that was the sinking of the titanic. Leonardo DiCaprio's Jack and Kate Winslet's Rose were plausible characters, but they were very annoying to watch. Some of their lines were so out of place and absurd that I felt deeply embarrassed watching these people. The love story seemed rather contrived and unbelievable. Finally, James Horner's music in the background just made the whole thing worse. In short, I did not feel anything for these characters or identify with their love story; and that, more than anything else, was what dragged this movie down.",5,3,6,12 October 2009
In Time," In Time
","'In Time' is a quintessential left-wing film which shrewdly exploits the Occupy Wall Street movement phenomena which gripped the United States at that time. This film finds a clever way to underscore how close the poor are to dying of poverty by creating characters with biological clocks who die once they run out of hours and minutes on those clocks. The only way not to run out of time and avoid death is to take out loans or work for low wages. So the strong impression one gets throughout this film is that the poor are always on the edge of subsistence.As for the plot of the film, it's essentially a simple version of Robin Hood. Without giving too much of the plot away, the hero Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) eventually joins forces with Sylvia Weiss (Amanda Seyfried) in order to steal from the rich in order to give to the poor. Yet strangely enough, 'In Time' ends up playing much better than it should largely because of the charismatic screen presence of Justin Timberlake. Timberlake is much more than just an appealing pop singer; he's also a talented actor. Although he is not given much to work with, Timberlake succeeds in making Will Salas an entertaining bad boy with a heart of gold who takes to the Robin Hood lifestyle like a fish to water. Another actor who injects some life into this formulaic film is the much under-appreciated Cillian Murphy. Murphy does not play a cardboard villain, but instead reveals something insightful about the psychology of an extremist. Like many extremes, Murphy's Raymond Leon (which reminds me of the police officer in Les Miserables) believes unquestioningly in the righteousness of his cause -- which is to make sure that the existing social hierarchy is preserved and that time never enters into the wrong hands.",7,1,2,17 October 2012
Thor," Thor and Natalie Portman's downfall
","Perhaps the best way to start this review is with an observation about a very talented actor's career. Natalie Portman demonstrated with her spellbinding performance as Nina in 'Black Swan' that she can act really well, but then she went on to act in three terrible films, 'No Strings Attached,' 'Your Highness' and now 'Thor.' In 'Thor,' Portman is simply miscast. She is not a warm actor meant to play in romantic films(that is more Amy Adams' vocation), but instead a cold and efficient actor who is more suited to roles where she is expected to play a villain or someone socially awkward (if not anti-social) or a gifted prodigy with inner demons. Yet director Kenneth Branaugh and the producers put her in this film where she is expected to play a romantic lead -- something that she never did very well throughout her two-decades long career. As a result, every romantic scene with Portman looks forced from the flirtation to the laughing to the kissing scene. She does all these scenes with professional efficiency, but that unfortunately is the problem. There is nothing professional or efficient about love. Love is this irrational, emotionally charged and fantastic thing. If anyone experiences love the same way Natalie Portman's Jane Foster character did, then perhaps they should reevaluate their relationship and find someone else.But that is not the only problem with 'Thor.' This movie fails at the screenplay stage. There are so many wall-to-wall special effects and blasting soundtracks (Hollywood frequently confuses loudness with good music) that there's no room for a plot or for character development. Moreover what little story line there is was taken out of dozens of movies which exhausted these plot gimmicks. Chris Hemsworth plays the 'Thor' character in the same spirit as Dustin Claire played Gannicus in the second season of Spartacus, except that Claire's character evolved beyond the caricature of the muscular cool guy at the gym who is loved by all women. Hemsworth's Thor, by contrast, has not even lived up to the caricature, because the plot allows for no character development. Or take how Jane Foster (Portman) and Darcy (Kat Dennings) react to the appearance of the muscular Thor. Those scenes of women enamoured with Thor's manliness are essentially a page taken out of a less than memorable scene in Cecil B. Demille's 'The Ten Commandments,' when muscular Moses (Charleton Heston) crosses the desert and happens upon a small farm with an elderly farmer and his daughters. The daughters are thrilled because they see a muscular, heroic man. In other words, 'Thor' is really the product of wall to wall special effects and recycled story lines. The immediate impression I got was that the producers decided to go with the first draft of the screenplay rather than telling their writers to go back to the drawing board and come up with something better. The result is mind numbing entertainment.As a final comment, the villains in this picture are not compelling. The frosty giants do not do anything except turn other people into frost or get knocked down in record numbers. This, of course, is boring because we have known for more than ten years that computers can create fake armies battling each other. Moreover this film does not have the guts, the imagination and the intelligence to show how brutal and dehumanizing violence and war really are (even though there are two battles on screen). Instead the violence appears to come out of several mindless video games. Something mildly interesting was done with the villain Loki, who may not have seemed as bad as the other villains, but even then Loki's character was so limited and oversimplified that he just wasn't interesting. I was stunned to see IMDb.com awarding this terrible film 7.4/10. It goes to show how easy it is convince the viewing public that they're not watching junk. I think 3/10 is more suitable.",3,2,5,31 July 2011
A Beautiful Mind," A Beautiful Mind
","Ron Howard's 'A Beautiful Mind' has been popularly considered a masterpiece. Certainly the film is very well acted. Russel Crowe delivers a remarkable performance as the highly gifted mathematician John Nash verging on madness. Jennifer Connelly gives a capable performance as Nash's wife Alicia. Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer and others also put in good performances. The movie is also technically impressive and the musical soundtrack is wonderful, except for that Charlotte Church song at the end. But 'A Beautiful Mind' is only a superficial masterpiece because it never achieves greatness.I have not reached this conclusion lightly. I gave this film considerable thought because, although I instinctively thought that something big was missing, I was not sure what that something was. Then it struck me. The problem with 'A Beautiful Mind' is really its tendency to oversimplify its subject matter. Great films force people to think and usually require more than one viewing to be understood. But Director Ron Howard's fault is in making films, like 'A Beautiful Mind,' that explain everything to the audience in very simple terms. Howard does not seem to understand that the people who go to see films, like 'A Beautiful Mind,' do not like an oversimplified story, because simplicity is boring. In making this criticism, I am referring to scenes like the one where John Nash's brilliant mathematical insight was explained in a very basic analogy of several men completing for one blonde woman in a bar. These men decide to change their strategy by working together toward a lesser goal - going after the brunettes - so that they all get laid. As I saw this scene, I realized that Ron Howard cares far more about towing the line of the Hollywood establishment than with the art of filmmaking. Hollywood's unspoken assumption has been for the last 30 years to oversimplify every story in order to make a film understandable even to unintelligent viewers and in the process get more people to buy theatre tickets. When set against this deplorable standard, 'A Beautiful Mind' delivers.The only trick that 'A Beautiful Mind' has up its sleeve is that the world that the John Nash character imagines is actually real. But once that trick is exposed, the plot is completely bereft of original ideas. Thereafter, the story line goes through all the motions of resolving the conflict and arriving at a happy ending -- and the experience of watching this film becomes boring and predictable. Even the ending, which is as artificial as the one in '2012,' can be anticipated by the middle of this film. 'A Beautiful Mind' is not a bad film. It can be quite interesting at times. But there is something lacking and artificial about this movie because it is all based on a trick on the mind - that we are in the beginning not sure about whether John Nash's weltanschauung is real or not. After we discover the trick, the only thing that we have left to do is wait for the movie to end. Russell Crowe's performance is worthy of an Oscar and yet by the same token the John Nash character is let down by the screenplay and direction. There is no attempt made to explain the complexities of the John Nash character. We are simply told that he has gone mad and to accept that. Considering all the great films that have gone much further in adding depth and fascination to their characters, the John Nash of this picture (he is much more interesting in real life) is a bit of a let down. There is also little effort made in explaining the wonders of mathematics, even though John Nash appreciated the potential of his craft well enough to come up with some very unique ideas. Instead math and madness are reduced to mcguffins for a simple love story between John and Alicia that never was. The real Alicia Nash divorced her husband during his prolonged spell with madness.6.5/10",7,0,2,4 April 2010
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Transformers 2: Please Don't Make a Sequel!
","The first impression I got watching Director Michael Bay's Transformers 2 was that the transformers were the least interesting characters in the entire film - except for that yellow camaro and the tiny robot that tries to steal this rock that serves as a memory chip. In fact, the most interesting part of the movie was the first 35 minutes which can only be described as fun, goofy, easy-going silliness. We see Sam (Shia LaBeouf) and his hot girlfriend Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) have a silly, but amusing argument about why neither of them can say the 'L' word -- even though they both love each other. We see Sam go to college and make a complete fool of himself in the classroom. We see Sam meet his crazy Spanish college roommate. And all of these scenes are accompanied by very quirky dialogue. We see a slutty girl try to seduce Sam and almost succeed when all of a sudden Mikaela catches them kissing. 'Is that your girlfriend,' the slutty girl asks. 'Ex,' Mikaela replies. Then we see the slutty girl turn into a transformer and try to kill Sam, Mikaela saving Sam and then Sam and Mikaela getting into a heated argument over his cheating while the transformer is trying to kill both of them - and, at that point, I was thinking to myself why did Roger Ebert only give this movie one star out of a possible four? I did not have long to wait for the answer to that question.What I deeply resent about this movie is that it reminds me of how arrogant the director Michael Bay really is. Here is a man who does not care at all about character development or the plot or even the dialogue, who throws hundreds of millions of dollars (maybe more) in creating special effects for more than two hours, and then expects his audience to think that he has produced a great cinematic masterpiece. How stupid does he think people are? And that's the problem with this film. There are lots of special effects, lots of underwater footage, lots of aerial pictures. lots of CGI and even the pyramids were thrown in, but who cares? In the end, all the images thrown on screen don't amount to whole lot. Most of the movie is devoted to showing transformers beating each other up like they are in a wrestling ring, which is about as entertaining and as loud as slamming two metal objects against each other again and again and again. And all this noise and all this crashing of metal parts goes on and on and on.In short, the problem with Transformers 2 is that too many special effects, too much noise, too many explosions, and too much CGI do not make a better film. They make a worse film. No doubt for Michael Bay, it was absolutely necessary for all this noise of transformers crashing into each other to last for 2 hours and thirty minutes. But if they cut out one hour and focused on developing the quirky, silly and funny set-up in the beginning - not to mention doing something more with Shia LeBeouf's comedic talents rather than have him dodge explosions (after all, you Michael Bay are paying his salary. So make the most of it) - then the film would not only be less expensive. It would also be better. I am tired of films that require their audience to passively take in one big explosion after the other. There are dozens of films that have done that already and there are many more with special effects - and the whole experience is getting tired and boring. We don't expect people to only listen to 'The Animals' from the 1960s or Jessica Simpson from the 1990s again and again and again. So why should we have to put up with films that have no plot, no characters, lots of noise and lots of CGI again and again and again. Before I conclude, the other thing I despise about this movie was that Steven Spielberg decided to write a check that was probably worth millions to finance the production of it, when he knew better (we know he knew better, because 'Schlinder's List' is proof that he knows how to make great movies). Obviously, Spielberg gets this year's award for biggest douchbag for accompanying Michael Bay on this ego trip and thinking that they can fool everyone into thinking that Transformer 2 is any good. It's not. Thumbs way down.",3,3,9,14 May 2010
Burlesque," Ho-hum film
","'Burlesque' is not so much a bad film as an unnecessary film. The protagonist Ali (Christina Aguillera) walks into the 'Burlesque' club one day and wants to work there as a dancer. She eventually becomes a dancer who apparently can also sing. Accompanying this plot line is a predictable love affair involving Ali and a love interest, Tess's (Cher) valiant efforts to raise enough money to pay off the mortgage so that the bank does not foreclose on the club (a plot recycled from dozens of other films), the jealous dancer who feels threatened by Ali (saw that before many times), and an evil developer who wants to tear down the club so that he can build a big sky scraper with nice views of the ocean. I suspect that if Ayn Rand was in charge of writing the screenplay, the developer would be the hero in this movie and Tess would be the evil collectivist. If you don't understand the joke, nevermind...The problem with this film is there is nothing new, or entertaining, about the story line. Or, put another way, if I had to decide whether to make the screenplay for 'Burlesque' into a movie, I would be asking myself, 'What is the point of turning this script into a movie?' The other problem with 'Burlesque' is the set. According to wikipedia, this movie apparent cost $55 million to make. Yet looking at the sets, I have no idea where the money went. The 'Burlesque' club looks like a cheap strip club where the strippers keep all their clothes on. Yes, that's right folks! Not only are you made to feel cheap going to this 'Burlesque' club, but you also do not see women getting naked for your pains -- which explains why this movie qualified for PG-13.The only plus in this film are its occasionally interesting characters. Christina Aguillera's sluttish dancing is always appreciated and a welcome distraction from the film's boring plot. Sadly, though, Aguillera appears to lip sink so much of her singing, contrary to the screenplay's premise that she is the only dancer who sings her own songs. The Cher character can also be interesting, partly because Cher is an interesting person in real life. Stanley Tucci repeats his warm hearted performance as the nice homosexual from films, like 'the Devil Wears Prada' and 'Easy A,' and he sort of pulls it off. There is nothing new in Stanley Tucci's performance, but he reminds you of an old friend that you do mind having a chance meeting with now and then. But overall there are better ways that you can spend your two hours than watching 'Burlesque' -- perhaps by going to a strip club.",5,0,1,17 June 2011
The Wrestler," The Wrestler -- A Review
","If you do not like watching wrestling, then you will still probably like 'The Wrestler.' Director Darren Aronofsky, whose cutting edge, raw style of filmmaking has attracted much controversy, has not only made a well-researched film about wrestling, but has more important animated it with compelling and quite touching human stories. None more touching and compelling was the story of Randy 'the Ram.' Mickey Rourke delivers a remarkable come-back performance as Randy 'the Ram' who physically can no longer live up to the image of the legendary wrestler that he once was, but who in his heart of hearts cannot give up the wrestling profession. Why? Because the wrestling arena is the only place where Randy 'the Ram' is not treated like a loser. In the arena, Randy finds camaraderie not only with his adoring fans, but with the other wrestlers. There are wonderful scenes where Randy and some other wrestler seem to beat each other up in the arena in some truly painful hardcore matches, but then become best friends after the fight is over. One of them asks Randy, 'Are you doing OK?' Then they go out for beers. How cool is that?But the best scenes in Randy's life are those that exist outside of the ring. There we watch Randy struggle with burden of being a loser in the world that exists outside of the ring. He does not seem to be going anywhere in life and he makes some bad choices almost with a naive innocence. Not surprisingly, his only daughter Stephane (Evan Rachel Wood) hates him; Randy has long ago given up trying to speak with Stephane's mother (she is not even in the film) and a possible emotional and intimate connection with a stripper named Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) is tenuous even at the best of times. And yet Aronofsky and writers Robert Siegel and Mickey Rourke (Rourke disliked the script at first and helped Siegel make substantial changes to it. Arguably those changes made 'The Wrestler' a great film and earned Rourke a much deserved Academy Award nomination) help the audience understand Randy 'the Ram' so well that it is just heart wrenching watching that man fall apart psychologically and physically over the course of the film.",9,1,1,13 March 2010
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Revenge of the Sith -- or Revenge by boredom for anyone who watches Revenge of the Sith
","'Revenge of the Sith' has been hailed as another great Star Wars film by many, but I believe that it ranks as one of the weakest. The computerized special effects have been applauded in other reviews, but I personally found them dull. The reality is that so many movies are using computer special effects these days that film-makers really have to come up with truly original computer images in order to compete in this market. James Cameron managed to stay ahead of the curve with Avatar's breathtaking images, but the movie scenes in 'Revenge of the Sith' look like they came straight out of a computer video came from the 1990s. As a result, I could not really believe in any of the situations which the characters found themselves in. Instead, it looked like I was watching Annakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), and the other characters surrounded by computer special effects. Aside from the visuals, this film also fails on the screenplay level. Annakin is depicted as an annoying, arrogant, and whining teenager by Hayden Christensen, with the result that we are not too upset when he is lured to the dark side. Padme (Natalie Portman) is just boring as Annakin's lover, which proves that Natalie Portman should not be cast as a love interest in movies. Ewan McGregor, on the other hand, has the thankless task of trying to fill the legendary Alec Guinness' shoes as Obi-Wan. McGregor fails to do this and perhaps was never capable of bringing the same gravitas to the role of Obi-Wan as Alec Guinness did. As a result, the 'Revenge of the Sith' has uninteresting characters stuck in a predictable plot with nothing fresh in it. The only actor doing anything fresh, in fact, is Ian McDiarmid as the Chancellor Palpatine – who is cloak and dagger character. I was honestly hoping to see a lot more of McDiarmid than the other characters. Yet unfortunately, the less interesting good guys hogged most of the screen time.I suspect that many people will go to see this Star Wars instalment, because they are Star Wars fans. They may even give it a pass, because they grew up loving the Star Wars characters and want to see them again. Yet on a more objective level, this movie offers nothing fresh or interesting save for McDiarmid's performance.",3,9,16,20 February 2009
Casino Royale," Casino Royale - Review
","After the Pierce Brosnan movies became far too farcical, the makers of James Bond changed direction and thank god they did. The new James Bond (Daniel Craig)comes across as a cold stiff, but fortunately he is rescued by a plot that is awfully good until the last 20-25 minutes.In contrast to the recent Bond films, 'Casino Royale' is smart enough to be relevant and interesting at the same time. In the aftermath of 9/11, one of the major preoccupations of western governments was to freeze the financial assets of terrorist organizations around the globe. So what could be more topical that to have a villain, Le Chiffre(Mad Mikkelsen), who relies on his gifts at mathematics and blackjack to lauder money for terrorists, make a killing at the gambling table and then share the profits with his terrorist benefactors. On top of that, Le Chiffre cries tears of blood, is unusually sadistic and has a hot girlfriend Valenka (played by Serbian model Ivana Milicevic). But that is not the only thing that 'Casino Royale' has going for it. 'Casino Royale' has a different kind of Bond girl too. In the past, the Bond girls were - let us be honest - sex objects to satisfy the appetite of the hero, James Bond. After all, in 'The World is not Enough,' Denise Richards was never convincing as a nuclear physicist. Then the Bond girl evolved into an action hero so that Hollywood could protect itself against charges of sexism by showing 'strong women' beating up muscular bad guys on the movie screen. But against this backdrop, the Bond girl in 'Casino Royale' Vesper Lynd stands apart. Vesper is sexually attractive, but she is not defined solely by that quality. Vesper is not an action hero, but her brilliant intellect more than compensates. In short, Vesper offers something very rare in a Bond picture: a Bond woman who is strong precisely because she is very intelligent.Finally, 'Casino Royale' presents some very fresh material, like an impending heart attack induced by poisoning, a phenomenal battle of wills at the blackjack table and a great torture scene. Unfortunately this picture was partly marred by a silly romance scene near the end.7.5/10",Null,1,3,1 October 2011
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Vicky, Cristina, Barcelona: Woody Allen has got his mojo back
","Before watching this movie, I was expecting an odd sex comedy. But actually, 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' is lot more interesting than that. Woody Allen has directed and written not only a love story, but he has captured the soul of Spain in a way I seen few American directors been able to do. Of course, not all the performances are great. I was never a big fan of Scarlett Johannsen and her performance as Cristina did little to change that fact. Rebecca Hall gave a better performance as Vicky who seems (in the beginning) to be attached to this idea of a stable and normal life, but who then is attracted to the wild passionate life that Catalonia has to offer her. But really the performances that make this film work, which really represent the heart of this movie, come from Javiar Bardem as Juan Antonio Gonzalo and Penelope Cruz as his ex-wife Maria Elena. They give the most passionate, fiery performances of this film. Then add these great performances the wonderful Spanish architecture, the atmosphere which is electric, the classical guitar music, and the often hilarious dialogue, and what you end up with is a film that comes close to being a gem. The ending is also suitable, if not quite unexpected.7.5/10",7,1,3,24 September 2009
The Breakfast Club," Breakfast Club
","'The Breakfast Club' is simply a story about a few teenagers who spend a whole day in detention and talk to each other. The beginning of the movie struck me as a bit ordinary, because I felt that these students embodied caricatures of the prom queen, the jock, the nerd, the goth girl, and the rebel without a cause rather than three dimensional human beings. At the early stages of the film, only Judd Nelson was able to inject new life with a fresh performance as a troubled, aggressive young man with so much anger building up inside him and occasionally rising to this surface. Yet as the film entered its second act, a strange thing happened to me. I found myself becoming absorbed in the lives of all its young characters. These students, away from the teacher's glare, were sharing their deep personal pain and this was fascinating to watch. Lastly the final act was really a metaphor for healing as these young people consoled and healed each other with love. This psychological portrait not only makes for very good entertainment, but is quite touching. So while 'The Breakfast Club' is not without its weaknesses, I recommend this film particularly for its second and third acts.",7,0,0,22 August 2016
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
","Indiana Jones is now on a search for the Holy Grail in the third slot of Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones' trilogy -- that is, until the terrible Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull came along. Suffice to say, the Holy Grail is not really the most important thing in this film. It is a pretext for a series of unlikely adventures and misadventures that includes an Arab cult, rats, a crusader's tomb, Nazis, secret passage ways, zepellins, a Pasha with a passion for automobiles, an unlikely battle with a tank, and a temple with boob-traps that could only have been put there by the all-mighty God, who (judging from the film) has a really dark sense of humor.Now very little of this Indiana Jones movie makes sense. For example, would the British really allow Nazi soldiers to march about freely in Egypt (which was then a British colony)? Probably not. But in director Spielberg's film, the Nazis roam about Egypt like they own the place. But that's not the part of the film that I object to. We already grown accustomed to this idea that 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' is not a serious adventure film.The problem with this movie is that it has too many action scenes and the overwhelming majority of them are boring. I am tired of watching chases. I am tired of the explosions. I am tired of pointless machine gun battles. I am tired of watching Indiana Jones best a German tank. And yes, I am tired of seeing Nazis being reduced to two-dimensional characters whose only purpose in life is the be evil bastards (which unfortunately is what Spielberg does all too often in his films). To his credit, Spielberg tries to make the action scenes more interesting by having Indiana Jones' father (played capably by Sean Connery) make fun of some of the action scenes. 'This is not archaeology,' he tells Indiana. But such humor only goes so far and the temptation is to skip through the action sequences as quickly as possible.Where Spielberg does succeed is in creating truly exotic sequences. I will not spoil anything, but suffice to say there is a sense of wonder when Indiana Jones walks though a chamber with artifacts or an old ruin. If Spielberg focused more of his attention on that, instead of the shootouts, the explosions and the silly chases, then he probably would have ended up creating a better picture.",6,2,5,25 April 2009
Law Abiding Citizen," Law Abiding Citizen
","Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) is at home playing with his wife and young daughter when suddenly he hears a knock on the door. When he opens the front door, two thugs Clarence Darby (Christian Stolte) and Rupert Ames (Joshua Stewart) burst in. Darby stabs Clyde, his wife and child. Only Clyde Shelton survives this event and he turns to the ambitious lawyer Nick Rice for justice. But since DNA has been denied at trial, Rice opts for a deal in which Darby gets five years for testifying against Ames who gets the lethal injection. This sombre, dark and serious backdrop is surprisingly and unexpectedly the set-up for an effective dark comedy in which Clyde Shelton not only takes revenge against Ames and Darby, but also teaches Nick Rice a lesson that he will never forget.I am inclined to regard 'Law Abiding Citizen' as a dark comedy/fantasy, because I cannot imagine it working any other way. Gerard Butler does not play his character straight, but rather with a comic and sarcastic edge almost as though from the very beginning he is out to make a point that the system of justice (as he sees it) is ridiculous. The facial expressions and the emotional response are different from what you expect from a man who lost his wife and child. Just compare Butler to Brandon Lee in 'The Crow' and you will see what I mean. 'Law Abiding Citizen' is also more of a fantasy than an action thriller, because what it is really about (if you think about it) is a victim fantasizing about what he would like to see happen to the criminals who ruined his life and to the justice system that (in his mind) let him down. Since the movie is about Clyde Shelton's fantasy and not about anything real, it features many unlikely and fantastic (but nonetheless entertaining) twists and turns that could only be found in a revenge fantasy. For example, Clyde Shelton launches countless terrorist attacks against the justice system while he is in prison. To be sure, the film explains how Shelton is able to do this, but(without giving away the surprise) the answer provided is itself implausible. The frequent face-to-face encounters between Nick Rice and Clyde Shelton in prison are also part of this fantasy, because they are too unlikely to be believed. A prosecutor would simply not spend so much time visiting a man that he had sent to prison. Lastly, the concessions to Shelton - which include a nice bed and a Frisco's steak - are highly unlikely, which is why those scenes and more particularly the reaction of the cell mates to them are so funny.I think this movie is going to appeal more to people who are themselves victims of crime and fantasize about taking the law in their own hands and about meting out justice to those who have wronged them. But I also enjoyed watching 'Law Abiding Citizen' when I stopped taking it seriously and saw it more as a revenge fantasy with a dark comedic edge - and on that basis I do recommend it. For all of the implausible plot developments, 'Law Abiding Citizen' has kept me entertained right to the end. Finally there is something quite refreshing about the Clyde Shelton character - and the way Gerard Butler played it - because it is different from the Hollywood characters in the revenge genre. Butler did something bold and original here, which indicates that he is more than the typical Hollywood actor (a la Keanu Reeves) and that the writers for once actually gave some thought to making this character not only intelligent, but subtle and intriguing.",8,0,0,10 July 2010
