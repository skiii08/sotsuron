E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Nerves of steel required!
","---This review does not contain spoilers---Boy, oh boy was it difficult to plow through. For a so called 'classic' it was almost unbearable to watch. Everything in this movie is so naive and badly played that I wanted to stab Elliot and his family in their throats 15 minutes in. I don't know why this move was so aggression-inducing for me but maybe it has something to do with: A) me not being 12 B) me not being an American C) me not living in the 80's D) watching Wes Anderson's movies same weekStill... not the worst movie I have seen.Thumbs up for Audi 5000 S (that INLINE 5!) and Dee Wallace's nipples.",2,4,12,6 September 2011
