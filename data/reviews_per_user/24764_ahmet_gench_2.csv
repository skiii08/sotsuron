Conquest 1453," A huge step for the Turkish Cinema
","First of all , the movie is about the conquest of Istanbul ( Constantinople ) by the Ottoman Turks under the lead of Sultan Mehmet Han. After the conquest , he was given the title ' Conqueror ' and since then he has been known as Mehmet the Conqueror.This is clearly the most important incident took place in the history of the Turks , so the expectations were pretty high. What I believe is that they thrived under the pressure. In terms of the accuracy of the story , almost everything looked fine. There were a few extra stuff added such as the love that took place between Eva and Ulubatli Hasan. And the visual effects.. This is what I was wondering. To me , they rock ! . There were some scenes that I haven't even seen in Hollywood movies. This one will encourage the producers to make such movies again and again. This was just the first and huge step leading to the others that will come after Conquest 1453. All in all , this movie rocks ! Even if you are not Turkish , you should have a look at it and I am sure that from the moment you start watching it , you won't dare go to the toilet.",10,61,138,19 February 2012
Click," Best Adam Sandler Movie Ever !
","He is the only actor who can both make me laugh and cry at the same time. Throughout this movie , I felt almost every possible feeling a person could feel.He does such transitions extremely well. This movie is one of the best in it's category. I don't understand why it is highly underrated ( just like 50 First Dates ). Whether I don't know nothing about movies or there are lots of people who doesn't appreciate Adam Sander and his movies.After watching this movie , you will understand what family is. You will also unconsciously be nicer to your family members.Remember to come back and vote for it ! :)",10,6,10,27 February 2011
