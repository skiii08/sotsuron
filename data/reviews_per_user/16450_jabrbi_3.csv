The Avengers," Empty Of Content
","Failing to fins a suitable villain the writers then patently failed to think of a decent story, but they still had 2 hours and 20 minutes of movie to fill. So what to do? Probably after several drinks and very late at night, someone had a bright idea: Let's pit the Avengers against each other! That'll fill at least 90 minutes of movie.And so we get a lot of contrived situations where one Avenger goes up against another. Of course, you can't pit a puny human against a demi-god, or the Hulk, or Iron Man, so the combinations are limited. Hawk-eye versus the Black Widow, Thor versus Iron Man, Thor versus Captain America, and so on.Having exhausted all those possibilities, we finally get to the main action against the 'baddies'. For a supposed invasion of Earth, we get to see a dozen troop carriers, with about 1000 troops, who proceed to randomly shoot at anything and everything. Cue nuclear blast and the story ends.And there we are. A film that's just one fight after another, with characters making senseless decisions, with indestructible heroes that defy the laws of physics, and SFX that detract rather than add to the experience.And then there are the plot holes, and there are dozens of them. There are so many of them that it would take me 2 hours and 20 minutes just to list them.If you want a film devoid of plot, with action sequences you can't follow, with a pitiful ending, then the Avengers is the film for you.",6,3,7,2 April 2014
Divergent," For Brain-Dead Idiots Only
","OK, this film is based on Young Adult fiction. When I was a young adult and reading books that meant no sex, single plot lines, no swearing, and the complexities of daily living are ignored. It didn't mean that there was no plot and completely unbelievable situations.I tried, I really tried with this film, but after 30 minutes I gave up. If this is the sort of stuff young adults are reading now and this is what's considered good stuff, then let's destroy all books published in the last 20 years and start all over again.We're meant top believe that every teenager in Chicago, which has been shut off from the rest of the world, when they reach a certain age, has to choose their future career based on a drug-fuelled dream and that, once that career has been chosen, then they can never change that career. And there are only 5 careers open to them. Really? Really?!? Really! And this choice is to be made by these teenagers at a ceremony where they share blades, cut themselves on their palms and drop blood into a bowl. Really? Really! And if they want to join Dauntless - the soldiers and police - they need to have no brains, be all brawn, follow orders mindlessly, and be as reckless as possible. Really? Really! First act of the new Dauntless recruits? Jump on the non-stopping overhead trains, and then jump off a few minutes later onto the roof of a building (again whilst the train is in motion). Proof, if proof were needed, that Dauntless is full of idiots with a lot more luck than judgement.And that's just one of the 5 Factions.Yes, young adult fiction is less complex that adult fiction, but that doesn't mean brainless, it means simpler.I just couldn't switch off my higher brain functions watching this film and gave up before I felt my IQ start to ooze out of my nose, taking a permanent dive into single figures.If you really, really don't think at all when you're watching films, then you might be able to get through this one unscathed. For the rest of us, who rank above amoebas on the intelligence scale, this is one film to avoid.There are no options for those who want to be in manufacturing, so the city just miraculously maintains itself,",3,1,1,10 January 2015
Elysium," For Matt Damon Fans Only
","This film is based solely on American moralities, where access to medical treatment is based solely on the ability to pay rather than actual medical need. If you can accept that only those able to pay should get any treatment then you can probably manage to watch this film.Here, Matt Damon is going to die unless he can break into a private facility, impersonate someone with the right to treatment - by definition this is someone with bucket loads of money - and access millions of dollars worth of treatment he has no ability to pay for. In order to accomplish this, Matt agrees to hijack an executive and steal valuable information from him, thus earning his passage into the facility that can cure him. And that's pretty much the entire driving force behind this movie.Of course, to make this plot acceptable to viewers, there have to be villains of the peace, who have no morals, against whom Matt struggles, and therefore can justify the ensuing violence. However, they are only there to make Matt's actions acceptable to viewers' moralities and sensibilities. Take away the mentally unstable characters in the film, and you're left with a bunch of minor crooks, focused around Matt Damon, out to get something they have no right to.This film could have been an indictment of the ability to pay versus the humanitarian need of the sick, an indictment of personal greed versus the needs of society, an indictment of the pursuit of power against a balanced society where needs come first, rather than wants, but Americans wouldn't pay to see such socialist ideals and attitudes. Instead we get artificially created villains to justify the protagonist's actions. The result is a nonsensical mishmash of events.If you accept that Matt Damon has a right to the medical treatment he can't afford then you can probably get through this film without throwing something at the screen. But if you realise that almost everyone in this film is some sort of socially maladjusted criminal, then you're going to struggle to accept any of the events that happen between the opening and closing credits.",3,0,1,11 January 2015
