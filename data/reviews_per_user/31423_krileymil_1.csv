Resident Evil: Afterlife," Better than the Third ONE!!!!
",Before I say anything I will comment on RE3 if you haven't watch it then don't read this.... and some about RE4 I really liked this one...I mean my favorite has been RE2 so far but was hugely disappointed with the RE3 for those of you who haven't seen it... it was pretty much a waste of your time... The story was horrible and ALICE becomes a GOD character which again I don't like because the story is about regular people trying to get out of crazy scenarios... pardon my French... but regardless this movie should have been made before the third one because you killed off characters that shouldn't have been killed off in a pointless movie. I think Carlos would have been great in this film had he not been killed off... Again I like the movie... Luther is awesome....Please stay until the end of the movie to catch a glimpse of umbrella and what's going on....,10,6,15,21 September 2010
