The New World," Rambling, incoherent and ineffectual - until Bale shows up.
","Terence Malick can sing with all the voices of the mountain, he can't paint with all the colors of the wind, but he can't put together a cohesive narrative. He is a visual artist, and a poet, but these skills do not compliment each other in 'The New World', a pretentious, disjointed mess. Remember the awkward scene in the first 'Superman' film where we hear Lois Lane's thoughts in a cheesy pseudo-poetic voice-over? Now imagine if that scene were tow and a half hours long. It's no surprise that it took four editors and multiple cuts to get this film in theaters - it plays as if the editors never talked to each other an assembled the film at random.The saving grace is Christian Bale. Batman arrives in the nick of time to provide the film with a compelling fully realized character that actually manages to make the film touching at the end, but it's a long wait to get there.",4,1,9,22 January 2006
The Incredible Hulk," A pale shadow of Ange Lee's infinitely superior version.
","Ang Lee's version had the nuances of a classic Greek tragedy. And, in the end, that's what superheroes are: they're the modern day equivalent of the Greek and Norse Gods of ancient times. We don't love Superman just because he can fly and lift heavy things. We love him because he is a symbol of the best in humankind, and yet also suffers from the same doubts, fears and unrequited love that plague us mere mortals. Superheroes are supposed to be fun, yes. But it does not have to be 'turn off your brain' fun. But, then . . . 'turn off your brain' fun has its place. While being painfully aware of its cheesy weaknesses, I had a great deal of fun with 'Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer', and even confess a great fondness for Joel Schumacher's 'Batman Forever'. But that's just it: The Incredible Hulk, as directed by Louis Letterier, was not that much fun.The new film is not a 'Batman Begins'-style reboot as was long rumored. No, it's actually more akin in many ways to 'Batman Forever' (though Letterier does use the opening credits to set up a slightly different version of the origin story than we saw in the previous film). We open with Bruce Banner (now played by Edward Norton) on the run from the government, who wants to use his alter ego, the Hulk, as a weapon. The government forces are lead by hard as nails, blood and guts, shoot first and later, cigar-eating General William 'Thunderbolt' Ross, played by . . . William Hurt? Seriously? WILLIAM FREAKING HURT. The ultimate stuffed shirt. The man who put the 'ass' in 'pomp-ass' (we know it's not spelled or pronounced that way, but in Hurt's case, it should be). As a piece of casting, this is akin to watching Kelsey Grammar portray a rodeo cowboy. It just doesn't work. In Hurt's defense, he does provide the film with its greatest moments of tension: we wait with baited breath to see if his mustache is going to fall off. But the smug self-satisfaction he seems to be taking in his own overracting makes his performance unbearable. And it doesn't help that most of his scenes are with Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky, a soldier with Captain Ahab-like obsession with defeating the Hulk, but an annoying tendency to slouch and shuffle like a 1920's Jazz musician with his shoes on the wrong feet when he walks. Roth, after his Academy Award nominated turn in the underrated Rob Roy, underwent some sort of bizarre religious conversion and gave up his talent for lent. Hurt and Roth are engaged in a titanic struggle to see who can chew the scenery more egregiously. No one wins, but the audience certainly loses.Banner, desperately seeking a cure for his condition, is lead back to his lost love, General Ross' daughter Betty (Liv Tyler). Norton and Tyler have an easy, breezy charisma that Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly may have lacked in those roles, but do not approach the same level of depth. And, besides, far too little of the film focuses on them. This is one of those comic book films that seems more interested in the villains than the heroes, but we're not talking Jack Nicholson as the Joker here. We're not even talking Scott Paulin as the Red Skull. We're talking WILLIAM *^@$# HURT AS . . . sorry. That was just a piece of casting that really didn't work for me.But the bottom line is, after two-time Academy Award Winner Lee's cerebral human drama failed to connect with mass audiences, the goal here was not to delve deeply into the characters, but instead to provide a series of exciting action set pieces. The was supposed to be the 'hulk Smash' version, and I went in embracing that and prepared to enjoy it on its own merits. After all, I've been arguing since 2003 that Universal Pictures and Marvel Studios were foolish to jump to the conclusion that Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon made Ang Lee an action director. That film featured eye-popping fight scenes, but in its heart and soul wasn't that far removed from Lee's previous Oscar-nominee Sense and Sensibility.But Letterier's direction makes one yearn for the steady hand of Brett Ratner or Mark Steven Johnson. It was as if Roland Emmerich and Michael Bay chose to band together and combine weaknesses. And darn it if Ang Lee didn't give us much better action sequences. Truth be told, while there may be more action senes in this film, in terms of quality, they don't even come close.This is not a film that is likely to make anyone desperate to have two hours of their lives back. It's not terrible. It's just . . . really not very good.",3,15,35,13 June 2008
Mission: Impossible III," Mission Accomplished.
","Congratulations to Cruise and Abrams on a mission accomplished. 'M:I-III' is a taught, suspenseful, action packed thrill ride that packs more excitement than the first two films put together. There are so truly amazing sequences, from the opening mission to the dazzling assault on an overpass by helicopters and jets as Hunt's team attempts to transport Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), easily the nastiest, and also the most low key, super-villain we have seen in the series to date.If there is one major weakness to the film, is that the plot is extremely thin - as usual, the filmmakers provide us with a 'MacGuffin,' a term coined by Alfred Hitchcock to indicate an item that the heroes must search after in order to move the story forward (such as the NOC List, which matches agents code names to true names, or Chimaera and Belarafon, the monster virus and it's cure). This around, our MacGuffin is the Rabbit's foot, a mysterious, unidentified object that is the thinnest plot device we've had to swallow yet - Abrams seems so aware that it's merely excuse to provide action that he really doesn't care what the object is (bringing to mind the mysterious suitcase in 'Pulp Fiction.').But on the bright side, the characters are richer and more fully realized than ever before. Ethan Hunt has left IMF field work behind, and is preparing to marry the girl of his dreams, the beautiful young Julia (Michelle Monaghan.). Ethan's love at first sight relationship with Nyah Nordoff Hall, the character played by Thandie Newton in the previous sequel, is conveniently ignored, but if there's one thing that Cruise has taught us, besides the fact that there is no such thing as a chemical imbalance, it's that if you can land a hot young girl, it's best to pretend that your past romances never even happened. The film's first act recalls 'Alias' so strongly that Abrams even throws in a cameo by Greg Grunberg. In addition to a more fully realized Ethan, we are treated to a true, honest to goodness IMF team, and they are given much more screen time in this film, as opposed to being relegated to the background sidekicks we have seen in the past two movies. This adds immeasurably to the film, and gives it a much less 'American Bond' feel, and the witty script gives them all their share of humorous dialogue. This was a caveat Abrams insisted upon before he chose to accept this mission, and it pays off gloriously. Abrams also seems to feel the need to flesh out (no pun intended) something on a explanation of where Hunt's amazing disguises come from, and just how they are made.But despite sharing more of the limelight, Cruise is still in top form as an action hero - he just keeps getting better with age. And the chemistry between Cruise and Billy Crudup, as an IMF colleague, is great. Laurence Fishburne adds to the proceedings as the requisite Agency Chief who suffers from a chronic case of rectal cranial inversion.On the whole, this is an extremely solid and satisfying piece of summer entertainment, and well worth the price of an admission ticket, even if doesn't exactly break the mold. There are enough eye-popping stunts and action sequences for at least five summer blockbusters. Some may complain that Abram's constantly roving camera is distracting, but overall, a major directing talent seems to have been discovered here, and we eagerly await his next project. If the reports of Abrams helming the next 'Star Trek' movie are true, it could be just the dilithium crystal needed to once again add power to the engine. And if it's this much fun, we'd welcome a 'Mission: Impossible IV'.",8,3,6,4 May 2006
Knowing," One of the worst films of 2009
","'Knowing' is a like a bizarre rip off of M. Night Shyamalan (and why would anyone want to rip off Shyamalan at this point?) mixed with a little 'DaVinci Code', some brainless sci-fi, and end-of-the-world pseudo religion. Director Alex Proyas has created some nice visuals, but it's such a pointlessly bleak and stupid movie that it's impossible to imagine how it was thought anyone would be entertained by this. If anyone needs to know how to predict disaster, it's Nicolas Cage so he can stop making movies like this. Insetad of paying to the see the film, covert $7.00 into quarters, and flush them down the toilet one by one. It will be just as cost effective, and twice as entertaining.I want to hurt this movie.",2,22,64,19 March 2009
Salt," Least satisfying action film of the summer.
","'Salt' starts out as a well made but painfully routing fugitive on the run thriller, then tries valiantly to do something original and different. Unfortunately, the routine section of the film is actually the better movie, as the plot twists become more and more ridiculous and don't hold together, and ultimately we are left caring nothing about any of the characters.Writer Kurt Wimmer has come up with a great concept, but a poor screenplay. Director Phillip Noyce tries, but there's only so much he can do with the material, and his only sillier tendencies also get in the way.In the end, 'Salt' is barely worth a look, but it's actually the least satisfying of the major action films of summer 2010. 'Inception' was brilliant, and all of the others at least knew they were just dumb fun. 'Salt' tries to be smart, and falls on it's face. The spectacular chase scenes almost save it . . . but not quite.",5,16,35,23 July 2010
Shrek Forever After," A very welcome almost return to form
","It's not really cool to like Dreamworks Animation anymore. Sure, they're not Pixar. Sure, they're too hung up on star power and pop culture references. But I've still enjoyed the majority their films more than I have a lot of what's out there. And I love the first two 'Shrek' movies. Their funny, entertaining, terrifically animated, and, too me, some of the best animated love stories that have been made. Most fairy tale romances perpetuate the idea that love is for beautiful people (even the masterpiece 'Beauty and the Beast' has it's cake and eats it too on this point), and Princes and Princesses are better than common people. 'Shrek''s idea of finding happiness in who you are was much more palatable to me. i found the first film a delight, and the second even better.But the third was only okay. The humor wasn't nearly as clever or funny, and the heart just wasn't there like it used to be. 'Shrek Forever After' isn't as good as those first two. But it's a big step back in the right direction.The story begins with Shrek getting used to being a father. He loves Fiona and the kids, but he misses his old life as a menacing ogre. He's seen more as a lovable tourist attraction now, and he doesn't like it. So, he makes a deal with the mysterious Rumpletiltskin (surprisingly NOT voiced by a name actor) to get one day back in his old life. In exchange, he gives up one day from his past. A day from his childhood that he doesn't even remember.Unfortuntaely, that day turns out to be the day he was born, and this leads to an 'It's a Wonderful Life' scenario where Shrek doesn't know Fiona, Donkey, Puss-in-Boots, or any of his friends, and Rumplestiltskin rules the Kingdom with a tiny iron fist. The resulting story is a great deal of fun, with Fiona now a warrior leading an ogre rebellion, the Gingerbread Man fighting as a gladiator against Animal Crackers, and so forth. The humor isn't back to it's highest heights, but there are a good number of genuine laughs. And the heart is back bigtime. I found 'Shrek Forever After' surprisingly touching..Okay, it's not as good as 'Toy Story 3' is likely to be, nor is it as good as 'How to train your Dragon'. but I had a blast with 'Shrek Forver After' and can't wait to take my niece and nephew",8,89,160,15 May 2010
X-Men: The Last Stand," Still fun, but it pales to the first two.
","Bryan Singer is a true filmmaker, an artist with a distinct vision who creates something that is his own. Brett Ratner is merely a director, a hired gun who supervises. as a result, 'X-Men: The Last Satnd' is enjoyable, but never reaches the heights of brilliance achieved by it's predecessors. In terms of story, characterization, effects and dialogue, this just isn't up there with 'X-Men' or 'X2'.A side note (SPOILER): For those of us who's only complaint with the brilliant 'X2' was that Cyclops was sadly underused, seeing him unceremoniously and ignobly killed off - by Jean Grey, no less - is downright painful, and not really necessary. Watching Wolverine and Cyclops having to work together to defeat the woman they both love would have been far more compelling. Cyclops/Summers/Marsden deserves better.",6,2,4,27 May 2006
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Clooney's masterpiece.
","'Good Night, and Good Luck' is a truly brilliant film, one that will be remembered for years to come as the movie that firmly established George Clooney as one of the top names in quality Hollywood film making. This starkly realistic approach to the story of Edward R. Murrow's on air battles with Senator Joseph McCarthy is more than just great drama, or even a great history lesson, but an important and timeless story that draws uncanny parallels to the problems we face in our world today. The cast is uniformly excellent, lead by David Strathairn in a breakout performance as Murrow, and George Clooney as producer Fred Friendly. The script is witty and profound, never beating you over the head with rhetoric, but getting it's message across loud and clear. 'We cannot stand in fear of each other.' In a time when our country is so divided on issues of right and wrong, and on what it means to be a patriot, 'Good Night, and Good Luck' is a welcome reminder of the true meaning of freedom.",10,3,5,24 December 2005
Super 8," One of the great ones
","In 1979, in the fictional town of Lillian, Ohio, a preteen boy named Joe Lamb is trying to cope with the recent death of his mother, who was killed in a factory accident. Much to the frustration of his father, the town's deputy sheriff, Joe copes by immersing himself in a project lead by his best friend, Charles. That project is a horror film, shot on a SUPER 8 camera, and Charles has enlisted the help of not only Joe, but the rest of his misfit friends, and has surprised everyone by talking Alice Dainard, the prettiest girl in school, into playing the hero's wife. On the night of the first big shoot, the would be filmmaker witness a train crash. Pretty soon, the town of Lillian is swarmed by military men, who won't tell anybody what is going on. Abrams and Spielberg may be the only two people in Hollywood who still know how to keep a secret, so I won't spoil that by going into the plot too much further. But I will say that Super 8 lives up to every bit of hype and expectation surrounding it. This is a beautifully crafted, emotional, funny, scary, thrilling movie that enthralls an audience the ways Spielberg's 80s classics did. And this is coming from someone who has been accused of 'worshipping' Spielberg. Abrams has recreated the look and feel of vintage Spielberg expertly, down to the last detail. For a Spielberg fan, it's an absolute joy to behold.But Abrams somehow manages to do this without completely sacrificing his own unique voice as a filmmaker. It's got the twists and turns of Lost, the personality of his Star Trek, and, like most Abrams projects, a leading lady who propels the whole thing. In this case, it's young Elle Fanning, who, as Alice, projects such a genuine combination of childlike innocence and ahead of her years maturity, that you can't take her eyes off of her whenever she's on screen. The entire cast is terrific, especially Joel Courtney as Joe, and Riley Griffiths as Charles, but Fanning steals the movie. We become completely involved with these characters in a way we rarely do with adult Hollywood heroes. I found myself caring every bit as much about the budding romance between Alice and Joe as I did the more spectacular events of the film.And it is spectacular. Abrams and Spielberg give us action/suspense scenes that evoke Spielberg's classics Jaws, Jurassic Park, and E.T. They also come as close to the emotion of E.T. as any film of this type has done since then. Super 8 is the kind of film for which the cliché 'You''ll laugh, you'll cry' was invented. If you're a child of the 80s and complain that they don't make movies the way they did when you were a kid, well, Abrams and Spielberg have done exactly that.And Michael Giacchino further establishes himself as one of the best film composers to come along in years. His score soars with emotions and build suspense in the vein of (of course) John Williams.I also have to take a moment, as former amateur child filmmaker, to talk about how well rendered that aspect of the story is. It certainly added an extra level of enjoyment for me that I vividly remember the days of trying to make my own blockbusters with nothing but a camera, a few friends, and wildly overactive imagination.It's worth mentioning, by way of warning (especially to parents) that Super 8 is rated PG-13 for a reason, namely the intensity, and for an E.T./Goonies like tendency to have the kids swear. Most audiences will get past this, but certainly some will not, and I'm absolving myself of any complaints. Movies like this are the reason I love movies. In an age when trailers give away everything, Super 8 unfolds before us, capturing us in its spell, and never letting go. It's an unforgettable movie experience. A film to be treasured,",10,211,396,9 June 2011
The Happening," An excruciatingly awful film.
","Okay . . . I give 'The Village' a lot of flack, but it had redeeming features. Some nice atmosphere, solid characterizations. 'The Lady in the Water' . . . well, I liked the two lead actors. But Shyamalan's latest monument to himself is infinitely worse than even the weakest moments of those films. It's not a question of where it ranks on a list of Shyamalan's films. It's a question of where it ranks on the list of worst films ever made. Gory but not scary, slow but devoid of character development . . . Mark Wahlberg is DREADFUL in this film, and he has proved himself a more than capable actor in the past. I couldn't even find any enjoyment in watching the adorable Zooey Deschanel. And James Newton Howard's score is so egregiously aping Bernard Herrmann's Hitchcock scores, he should be sued. If there is anything in all of creation that you hold dear, avoid this movie like the cancerous plague on the anus of cinema that it is. This movie made me question my will to live on a planet where films this bad are made. Okay, that last line was maybe a SLIGHT exaggeration. But only slight. Seriously, I'd rather watch a marathon of 'Armageddon', 'Batman & Robin', 'The Avengers' and 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' back to back than sit through ten minutes of this again. Trust me: even you Shyamalan defenders aren't likely to enjoy this one. There's no touching human element like in 'Signs' (or like some of you found in 'The Village'). It's just pointlessly, gory, dreary tedium. If you want to see an infinitely superior film with a similar premise, check out Frank Darabont's 'The Mist.' Better on every possible level. Shyamalan wants to be seen as a modern Hitchock, but this time, he comes closer to Ed Wood. I am seriously beginning to wondering if he plagiarized 'The Sixth Sense.' I'm only sad it opened to respectable business (if universally scathing reviews). Captain Ego needs a dose of humility and reality. And to have his kneecaps broken. And, being a softy, I went easy on this one.",1,5,12,18 June 2008
Toy Story 3," A Movie For The Ages
","The one name in Hollywood today that can be truly, universally trusted every time is Pixar Animation Studios. Their two 'missteps', 'Cars' and 'A Bug's life', are disappointments only in that they don't contend for best movie Pixar has made. They're A minuses instead of A's. 'Toy Story 3' joins the pantheon of great Pixar films, and all-time great sequels. It stands out as the best film of 2010 at this point. While it may not be as brilliant from start to finish as the second 'Toy Story' film (the animated equivalent of 'The Godfather Part II'), is so engaging, so witty and entertaining and exciting, that adults and children will be pulled in all the way. And the third act ramps up the emotion to a degree equal to the best of it's predecessors (my 5 year old nephew had to turn around and ask 'why are you cwying?') The highly publicized plot line deals with the toys beloved owner Andy moving on to college, and choosing the fate of his beloved toys. Through one of those complex farcical events that seems so common in Andy's household, the attic bound toys (minus Woody, who is supposed to go to college with Andy) are accidentally donated to a daycare center. Woody, of course, has to rescue his friends, but there is some doubt as to whether they want to be rescued: Andy hasn't played with them for years, and the daycare, a toytopia presided over by lovable teddy bear named Lotso Hogs Bear (voiced by Ned Beatty, in a welcome return to the screen), promises the chance to be played with everyday. And when these kids get older, new kids replace them. To the love starved toys (especially Jesse the yodeling cowgirl, who is terrorized of repeating the experience she had with her beloved Emily), this seems like the opportunity of a lifetime. It goes without saying that all is not as it seems.Part of the genius of Pixar is that, in what are ostensibly children's films, they deal with very sophisticated and adult themes. Here, the struggle to grow up while holding onto the joy of childhood is captured beautifully, as are the themes of moving on and dealing with the loss of loved ones (there is a a brief reference early in the film, just a few lines, where Woody's reaction, between the animation and the greatness of Tom Hanks voice acting, is an exquisitely subtle and poignant heartbreaker). And, of course, the comedy is hilarious. I wouldn't have thought there was still new material left to be milked from the Potato Head's detachable appendages, but the new twists are innovative and hysterical.If you have kids, take them to 'Toy Story 3'. If you don't, go anyway. Pixar has once again proved that they are the most reliable name in film today.",10,19,30,16 June 2010
Munich," One of the great films of all time.
","Steven Spielberg's treatise on middle-eastern violence ranks alongside his Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan as a towering achievement. Part electrifying thriller, but heart-wrenching tragedy, this is likely to provoke more thought and debate than any other film this year, and has all of the hallmarks of a master storyteller at the peak of his form. Rather than criticizing Israel, as some have suggested, or vilifying Palestine, as others have complained, Spielberg observes the cost of violence on nations and individuals. Working from a brilliant script by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth, Munich asks difficult questions and doesn't provide easy answers. The cast, including Eric Bana, Daniel Craig and Ciaran Hinds, give excellent, understated performances. The recreation of the Munich massacre is as devastating in it own way as Spielberg's take on the D-Day landing, but the quiet moments where the Mossad assassins question their own righteousness are perhaps even more effective.Munich is one of the bravest films ever made, and Spielberg deserves to join the exclusive club of three-time Oscar winning directors on this one.",10,13,27,24 December 2005
