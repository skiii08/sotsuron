The Equalizer," Everything John Wick wanted to be.
","Guess which movie I'm describing:
A retired hitman/ agent is pulled back into butt-kicking mode because the Russian mafia messed with something he cared about.John Wick? The Equalizer?Answer: Yes.The difference is The Equalizer really just towers over Wick as a film.
Full disclosure: I appreciaed the cinematography of Wick and saw what it was going for but felt the whole film was flat and gimmicky more than the cool and flashy film it was going for.
Not all would agree with me.Where The Equalizer beats John Wick is that Equalizer weaves a story and plotline that is actually engaging, featuring characters that you care about.
There's the human element to The Equalizer that Wick just missed.
Denzel Washington is about the best at his craft and he shines at translating human emotions through his character onto the screen. Further, there was a redeeming aspect to the story with a guiding 'noble cause' that excused this film from being just another action-thrilller filled with 'senseless violence.'
The action sequences, while not as flashy as Wick, were delivered with more meaning.
Wick suffered from losing impact through running a continuous loop of action sequences that all started to blend together.
The Equalizer took care to mind the pacing and rhythm of the story, interweaving action and downtime for plot and character development.The story telling was direct enough to not be confusing, but left enough up to the imagination to avoid being boring. For example, it was never spelled-out what Washington's character did for a living prior to working at the hardware store.There were some interesting McGuyver-esque 'being resourceful with your environment' elements to the action that was refreshing in comparison to the heaps of cliche action films where gunplay/ Martial arts are the only vehicles for kills.The cinematography was flawless and ventured into some creative shots and techniques. The big climactic ending entailed some dazzling filming involving some artful use of lighting and rain. That film-work alone is worth the watch.The main antagonist did seem to be going for a very Kevin Spacey vibe in looks and persona. The casting almost was a doppleganger for Spacey. I have to wonder if they missed an attempt at getting Spacey for the role. I felt on that front, it felt that character a bit forced
and cliche.My apologies if this review came off as more a comparison, but the two films are just so similar on the surface and (in my opinion) The Equalizer was a superior film in almost every way.8.5/10",8,2,3,29 November 2018
John Wick," Bland story with outstanding visual aesthetics
","Looking through other reviews it's apparent that people either love or hate this movie.
I can see both sides and personally thought the movie was rather poor, but it did have some things to appreciate about it.
Let's break it down:
(On a scale of one-ten stars)Story/script/plot: one star. Really the story was just a conduit to carry all the action sequences. If you came to watch a film that has any plot or something to stimulate the mind or emotions...look elsewhere.Casting/ acting: Four stars. Nothing absolutely awful but no remarkable performances. Just overall a flat, lifeless story and script that left little room for acting to have any impact or power. Actors, again, function as huminod forms for the action sequences to operate in.Cinematography/ set/ lighting: Ten stars.
Here's were the film really avoids being a total flop in my opinion. The cinematography was excellent in every way. Much creative use of color motifs and dramatic lighting.
Very interesting use of specific color hues in key scenes that coincide with the tone of the story. Fantastic luxurious sets. Great chic wardrobe selections- almost like The Matrix meets Wall Street. The climactic fight sequence in the rain was a visual masterpiece.Soundtrack: One star. Here's one part of the movie that really cheapend any artistic value it had going for it. The music was just so hokey. It felt like it was obnoxiously loud and overbearing intentionally in attempt to leverage the excitement the movie was lacking.
Just banal and tasteless.Action/ coreography: Six stars. Okay. So this movie calls it's action 'gun Fu.' The coreography and action was just ok. Yes, it used longer sequences without changing shots and had some very intricate coreography.
But there was never any suspense built up or context to support all the action- which makes it feel less intense.
It all came off as an extended dance routine with lots of headshots.
The fancy gunwork and martial arts would carry greater weight if undergirded by some moticum of a story line or performed by a character that you actually cared about.
Without the subcontext the movie ends up subjecting the audience to watching an extended sparring match. Hollow visuals.Conclusions:Imagine the final fight sequence from the first Matrix where Trinity and Neo shoot up the security gate in the lobby while rescuing Morpheus...now take that scene and try to make that one scene stretch for a feature length movie.
What you get is John Wick.It did have the sense of a comic book in film format: the framing choices, the lighting selections and the (goofy) colored/stylized subtitles all we're direct stylistic transplant from comic book style.I'm sure 15 year old boys would love this movie. It almost feels like it was made by some 15 year old boys with their daddy's budget.In short, John Wick is a beatifully filmed extended fight coreography performed by humanoid forms with some obnoxious music pumping too loudly.
John Wick is all about the visual aesthetics. To that extent, it excells.You may love it. You may hate it.I don't regret watching it but wouldn't recommend it as a great film to watch.",5,0,0,28 October 2018
The Irishman," Understated, script driven mafia flick
","It's not just another Scorcese mob film. Don't expect dramatic car chases, raucous shootouts, scandal or bombastic violence.
This film is a smooth rolling, low-key story that isn't hurried and is more concerned with dialogue and character interchange than with exciting effects and 'money shots.'
The criticism that this film is boring and slow is far from the truth but I can understand how some viewers receive the movie that way.The script and acting is top notch. Scorcese never takes himself too seriously and he interjects some playful creative filmmaking elements along the way in classic Scorcese fashion.
He also masterfully makes use of subtle... almost subliminal motifs that add depth and richness to the story (i.e. the use of bread and wine {grape juice} to evoke image of The Last Supper directly before a certain character dies).I didn't think the movie was boring at any point. I enjoyed every minute of it. But I symopathize with the critique that it could have been tidied up a little, especially in the final act.The feel and pacing of this movie is best compared to slowly sipping a glass of wine on a lazy evening (as opposed to the frenzy of Mountain Dew and strobe lights Hollywood insists on force-feeding audiences).8.5/10",8,2,4,10 December 2019
Legend," Odd song choices
","Gangster film set in 1960's England.
And we get all this funk/ soul music in the background. Odd choice.
The only conjecture I have as to why they chose the songs they did is that similar music has been successfully used in other crime/ gangster movies and they wanted to mimic that feel.
(Other than the club crooners) the music selection felt completely out of place and made the film feel contrived and hokey.I know music is a small thing to nitpick on but to me it stuck out like a sore thumb.",5,1,2,30 January 2020
1917," A triumph of cinematography. Lacking in story.
","Such an ambitious and pristine foray into new forms of filmmaking.
A captivating exploration of life as a soldier in WWI warfare.
The strength of this film is the masterful and unique artistry of single-perspective aesthetics and visuals with zero cuts.
Beautifully filmed and acted.
The story and script were clearly lacking. Definitely not the strength of this film.
If not for the captivating and original approach to filmmaking, I wouldn't give this film a 8/10 stars. Probably would give it a solid 7stars.
But the daring (and might I say, successful) attempt at new approaches to filmmaking talks itself into a bonus point.
8/10 stars.",8,0,2,26 January 2020
Prisoners," Perfection. Everything every thriller wants to be.
","This movie is a masterpiece.
Wonderfully written/ scripted/ filmed/ acted.
It takes the viewer through a downward spiral of suspense and emotion.
There's not a single thing that could be done to improve on this film.
10/10 stars.",10,1,1,5 December 2019
