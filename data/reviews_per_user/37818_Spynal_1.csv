Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Episode 1: the best introduction for a saga EVER
","Obviously, you aren't a huge Star Wars fan. You don't understand the importance of the characters, why they act the way they do, the importance of the Trade Federation and senator Palpatine, AKA Darth Sidious, and anything else you found boring. You have to understand that this is the first chapter of the 6 part saga and it is merely an INTRODUCTION. this means that bigger events are setup and characters are still mysterious so later on they aren't boring and useless. George Lucas has said that things will start to get rolling in episode 2 and then in episode 3 all hell breaks loose. Episode 1 isn't a carbon copy of A New Hope (episode 4). It takes place in a peaceful time, the 'civilized day' as an older Obi Wan said. Everyone is happy, the Jedi are in full control. But unfortunately, and phantomly (hehe, pun) things are starting to go wrong. The Jedi council are way to cocky and think they are invincible now. The republic senate is corrupt and falling apart. And the Force is UNBALANCED. These three issues will be solved in very different ways in Episodes 2 and 3 and even up to 6. The senate will regain integrity through Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's lies of a new and better order. Eventually he takes over the senate and declares himself Emperor. Secondly, the Jedi council will discover they aren't invincible and too cocky when they are hunted down and destroyed in the 'Jedi Purge', headed by Palpatine yet again. Thirdly, and most importantly (hell, it's the focus of the entire saga) the Force will be balanced when Anakin destroys the Emperor and Luke goes on. Notice how important Palpatine is in this chain of events. Now, NONE of this could have happened in Episode 1 because it all happens over the course of 40-50 years. The characters need to be setup, not developed fully mind you and the surroundings and current status of the universe need to be established. That takes an entire movie, and it should, or the saga will truly suffer. Episodes 2 and 3 will be really heavy on character development and huge events occurring (clone wars is one of them).
Since you like Jar Jar, which I do (something we agree on, strange)you'll be pleased to know, Lucas stated in a recent press conference that Jar Jar will be in Episodes 2 and 3. I hope this helped you to understand why things are the way they are in the Star Wars universe. Maybe next time, don't rush into posting a message like that.",10,0,0,25 September 1999
