The Equalizer," Paint by Numbers
","The movie is a series of clichés. Denzel saves it from being 0 stars.One cliché this didn't have was the bad guy operative being an old associate of Washington's character.Slow mo walking away after whipping the bad guys? Check.Slow mo walking away from an explosion? Check.Getting ready to ambush the bad guys? Check multiple times.The bad guys burst into the room, but the good guy isn't really in that room? Check.Declaration 'I am the storm' or 'I am the something' aka 'I am a bad ass'? Check.Someone asking 'who are you'? Check multiple times.Scoping out the room than whipping all the bad guys? Check multiple times.It was easy to whip the bad guys, but I'm a little rusty? Check.Hero knows his home turf? Check.Give the bad guys a chance to walk away. but they don't? Check multiple times.Hero is cornered...or not? Check.Some years the same movie comes out under different names. John Wick meet Equalizer.",3,9,16,12 January 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Attack of the B Team
","A B team of heroes fights a failing Imperial middle manager. That's Rogue One in a nut shell. But it's the bestest ever Star Wars movie because DIVERSITY! - except all the main bad guys are white males.But there's a cool warrior monk! He says this mantra abut the force, 'allowing him to have full use of his senses and makes his blindness a non-issue'. That is, until he has to pull a switch. Then he flails around just like I would if I had my eyes closed.The whole Rogue One team dies - each one either while taking pivotal actions to save the mission, or just after taking pivotal actions to save the mission.A Disney big franchise movie can't miss the opportunity to re-imagine scenes from older Star Wars movies. So this has a re-imagining of the star destroyer flying into another one. It has a re-imagining of Luke facing the fiend who killed his father - the young heroine faces the middle manager who killed her mother.'I have a bad feeling about this...' goes to the re-programmed imperial droid. But the 'this' is cut off. It's supposed to be funny, and it is a nod at the re-imagining going on in the Disney SW Universe. We don't need the old clichés because we have diversity.There is a meaningless cameo from R2D2 and C3PO. CGI Leia has a more meaningful scene. CGI Tarkin holds his own in a few longer scenes.There aren't meaningful character arcs. People go from one thing to another without any motivation in between. There are character moments. That's better than nothing.The movie isn't bad. But it's nothing special.",5,12,23,13 January 2017
The Hateful Eight," Should Be Hateful Nine
","Not sure what people see in Tarantino. This movie was awful, and T's hate comes out in every scene.The first half is plodding, pointless, boring. The second half is bloody action that's absurd.The movie jumps the shark in Chapter 4, when a narrator narrates what's being shown on the screen.A sure sign of a bad director is he keeps secrets from the audience. Another sure sign of a bad director is he moves around in time. Tarantino does both in this movie.Oh, BTW, Tarantino and Jackson want you to know that all white people are racists.",2,1,4,29 June 2017
Underworld Awakening," Kind-UH
","Some say the story isn't good, but it's good enough. The problem is the action. It's over produced, over posed, with too much CGI.If you look at a list of standard superhero moves - the fall to the crouched three point stance, the head tilt, the jump spin - they're all used frequently. The fights don't flow, because they're flurries of action leading to cool poses.There's too much slo mo, especially the 'now the cool hero is angry, and she's about to do something really cool' kind of slo mo walking, often with the generic dark coat tails flipping behind her.Then there's the girl. She's supposed to be 12, she looks 17, and she's more powerful than she can ever know. Good grief. We've seen this before in Firefly, for exaaaaaaaaaaaahmple. I write it as exaaaaaaaaaaahhhhmple because most of the people speak with a Euro accent.Bottom line - it tries really hard to look like the Matrix, but it's more like the forgettable 3rd Matrix movie - a parody of itself.",3,1,3,23 February 2017
Suicide Squad," Darvel MC
","Why are DC and Marvel movies the same? Batman vs Superman = Captain America Civil War, right down to the techy hero having his parents killed by bad guys.Suicide Squad = X-Men Apocalypse. Humans turn on a god like being, entrap him (them), then turn to, in the gods' words, worshiping machines. Now the gods are back to re-conquer the world.Recruited to stop the gods are the X-Men/Task Force X, a team of mutants/meta humans. But the god also recruits some of the mutants / but one of the meta humans is one of the gods. Some of the X-Men who help defeat the god are former villains / most of the Task Force X members who defeat the gods are villains.At least the Marvel version had a lot of action. This one meanders for long stretches without any meaningful action.The Joker portrayal is the worst in screen history.",3,1,1,3 January 2017
Doctor Strange," Warped Spirit
","Marvel delivers the body - such as Hulk and Thor. Marvel delivers mind/soul - such as Iron Man. But when it comes to spirit, Marvel delivers a warped version.It isn't an accident that the movie portrays a 'good magic' master listening to music from Beyonce. She claims she's possessed by a demon that takes over when she performs. A 'good magic' monk listens to a demon perform in the strong hold of 'good magic'.Of course Marvel wouldn't portray spirit as anything to do with God. Buddhism, mysticism that denies the existence of God, is the ultimate spiritual power in the warped Marvel world.",1,6,14,18 February 2017
Pacific Rim," Are They Kidding?
","This movie is awful. The giant robot vs monster fights are Transformer style, often too close in to see what's happening. The human plots are half baked. The acting is bad.If they had focused on the overall giant robots vs monsters action and one human plot, it would have been much better. But with all the sub plots crammed in, and with the movie starting near the end of the story, the movie ends up a bad drama and a bad monster movie.The giant monsters are pretty boring. The robots are pretty boring.It even seems like the director/writer couldn't keep their own story straight. They make a big deal of left and right - one pilot controlling one side while the other controls the other side. But then, in the action scenes, both pilots move their control arm to move one robot arm.It doesn't make sense the way the monsters destroy some robots, but can't do the same to others. The monsters rip apart the supposedly strongest, heaviest, best armored robot. But they can't do the same to another, less well armored robot.Generic Japanese Girl is awful. Oh, she's tiny, but she's tough.",4,1,3,23 December 2016
Salt," It's Not the Bomb, it's a Bomb
","Absolutely awful movie.The action is mostly Angelina Jollie, built and dressed like a model, running away from people. Every once in awhile, she does something actiony, like jump from one moving truck to another.I would say Jollie mailed in her performance, but if she did, she forgot the postage. She portrays nothing. There is no emotion - happy or sad - to the things happening around her. She makes emotional motions now and then, but it looks like a rubber doll posed. There's nothing behind the movements.The plot is generic as it gets. There's even Jollie patching herself up after a chase.Maybe she is a sleeper agent. Her mission? To bore Americans to death.",1,2,7,5 March 2017
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," What if Hansel and Gretel Sucked?
","When someone claims to re-imagine something in Hollywood, it's a sure sign the person has no imagination. If you can't come up with something of your own, you may as well ruin someone else's stuff.This movie is a boring, meandering, poorly scripted, poorly acted, poorly choreographed, poorly filmed, poorly costumed, poorly arted (is that a word) crap fest. It would be OK if it was funny or fun, but it's neither of those.For half the movie, guns and other weapons work on the witches. Then, suddenly, they become impervious to guns and other weapons. The witches' big plot is to make themselves impervious to fire. They need the top white witch's heart to do that. But that doesn't matter because the good guys find a book that lets them bless weapons, so the weapons again work on the witches (like the weapons worked in the first half of the movie).There's a back story about H and G's mom being a good witch who wouldn't run last time the evil witches tried to become impervious to fire. Oh yeah, their original plan was to have the towns folk burn H and G's mom, which would have destroyed her heart. The witches wouldn't have been able to use the heart to make them impervious to fire.Ah, the story makes no sense.",1,4,6,12 July 2017
X-Men: Days of Future Past," And Bwuh?
","The story isn't bad, but the characters and acting are awful.The core group - Xavier, Magneto, Wolverine, Raven/Malice, even Storm are fine. But the rest - either the character or actor, or both, are awful. Half the cast is like something from a weekend cosplay convention.Bad Characters - Talk about generic people and generic powers. There's the cold guy, surfing around on ice. There's the hot guy, firing flame all over the place. For some reason, Sentinel hot stolen from hot guy trumps cold guy powers, and Sentinel cold stolen from cold guy trumps hot guy powers. They're just examples of generic characters or lame characters - there's one guy whose power is to make people throw up. There's not a lot of thought into how many of these people use their powers. It's like watching a bunch of video game players poorly express powers in generic ways.Bad Acting - Halle Berry is a bad actress. She's wooden. But at least she is natural - she just doesn't express much emotion. Half the cast doesn't appear natural when delivering lines. If Halle Berry makes you look bad, then you're really bad.Many of the actors and actresses in this movie pose their lines. They also make weird body motions when they express their powers - the flail arms down, head tilt, shoulder shrug, or hard nod forward. Wolverine throws his hands down when he extends his claws, but he makes it look natural. The bad ones, and there are many of them, don't make it look good.The fights are decent, if a little generic. The plot is weak.This is only a good superhero movie to people who think special effects are all that counts.",4,2,4,11 December 2016
Avengers: Infinity War," Call it Lamevengers SJW Wars
","The writing was on the wall with an early fight between Thanos and Hulk. OK, Thanos is all powerful, but he beats Hulk with a few punches and knees. At least make the fight big.The writing got worse when the Guardians of the SJW Galaxy took the screen - cardboard characters wisecracking their way through vacant scenes.In fact, that's most of the movie. Most of the men act like 12 year old boys, arguing at the drop of a hat. That's supposed to be Stark's gimmick, but most of the heroes (males) act that way. There's no difference between Stark, Peter Parker or even Dr. Strange or even his Buddhist buddy.Most of the dialogue is banter. Mostly the so called actors pose their way through scenes. The fight scenes are so CGI and camera movement heavy that it's impossible to tell what's happening.The movie made a lot of money - a lot of people love the Emperor's new suit.",2,6,11,20 October 2018
Django Unchained," MIxed Up in Time
","The movie has brutal, fun action. But Tarantino has a tendency to go back and forth in time - lots of flashbacks - for no good reason. At times he shows a meaningless scene, then goes back a few minutes to a set up that adds no meaning to the scene.Show the movie in order.But he can't. Because the flashbacks, the zig zags in time are necessary to keep the audience guessing. If people don't have to guess, they'll realize this movie is empty. If people have to guess, they'll think they're watching something clever.This isn't as bad as some of Tarantino's movies. But it's not the masterpiece his worshipers claim it is.",4,2,3,9 July 2017
Kick-Ass," First Half Awesome - Second Half Meh
","The first half of the movie set up an epic superhero story. But in the end there was nothing epic - no epic story, no epic resolution, no epic fights, no epic characters.Dave, Kick Ass, the main hero, ended up being just a regular guy that could ride a hero's coat tails.The movie should have been named Ghost Girl and Big Daddy.In the end we learn that hero's are just regular people who decide to make a difference. Duh.It's like the writers got bored half way, or they ran out of ideas half way. 'Crap, we have to make an ending to this!' The movie is like a roller coaster that brings you up to the top of a precipice. You look down at a 10,000 foot drop, thinking, 'how the heck am I going to survive the ride down!!!???' Then a door opens at the side. 'That's the end of the ride.'",5,1,3,6 January 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," Spit Spot
","The story is a condensed mishmash of different comic book Apocalypse stories, with some characters smashed together into Apocalypse. It doesn't work well.It seems the most prevalent mutant power is bad acting. Some of the people who play main characters are decent actors, but, unfortunately, some of the people who play main characters aren't.Overall, the movie has too many models trying to be actors.Gene doesn't talk. She murmurs all her lines.Professor Xavier tries too hard to be British. Spit spot? Is this Mary Poppins? There are a lot of 'I'm projecting my powers boy am I cool', overused motions: Spread arms down, head back, scream; spread arms up, head back, scream; throw arm out, cock head; hop step, run into action.Speed boy has the generic, speedster sarcasm. His nonchalant, waste lots of time style ends up getting someone killed. If speedy had gone right to work saving people, he would have saved blonde model boy. But nobody calls Speedy on it.Magneto is back to awesome - even before his powers are amplified. For some reason, when he faced the Sentinels, all he could do was make haphazard barriers of bits of metal. He must have forgotten about using metal, even tiny objects, as weapons.Magneto's motivation, however, isn't awesome. It's the generic he lost his wife and daughter. He, as a leader, falling so easily to obeying A is ridiculous.How does an earthquake in Egypt powerful enough to be felt in Poland not damage the nearby area? Tons of rocks were shifting, yet there was no sign of damage just a few feet above all that movement. And people nearby don't even notice.Apocalypse needs Magneto to pull up all of man's constructions. A tells Magneto to do that right after A does it. Why does he need Magneto? I had to watch this in three pieces. I couldn't take it all at once.It seems the directors/producers who make the X-Men movies like having multiple battles at the same time. That way there's no focus on any one battle - they're all pretty lame. There's a lot of CGI, though. All the good guys intone the generic 'we're with friends' blather.The final part of the final fight is executed in 'super cool' slo mo. Gene slowly walks, then she does the arm extended down, throw head back, scream (in a murmur) cool project her powers.Magneto helps them rebuild the school, then he's off to become evil again.There's cool music playing over a lame speech 'forget everything you know' by Mystique as she does the standard walk while looking sideways over her shoulder - see, that's cooooooooooooool.A few people growl - this is gonna be so coooooooooooooool.That's the end. Maybe being so generic you're lame is the prevalent mutant power.",3,0,3,17 December 2016
Logan," Terminaverine
","Notice the positive reviews of this and every other XMen/Wolverine  movie. They all claim 'masterpiece', 'the best superhero movie  eveeeeeeeeeeeer', and 'this is how you make a superhero movie'.  The positive reviews are canned, scripted, generated by publicists.  This movie wants to be Terminator. It even uses similar music as the  perfect killing machine stalks a little girl protected by the imperfect  killing machine.  Like other Boreverine movies, this one takes away Wolverine's healing  because the writers don't know how to handle it. The Wolverine from the  comic books is weakened and supposedly humanized. But what's left is a  Wolverine bereft of what makes him super and bereft of all emotion.  Can we get a superhero movie that's about a hero?",1,25,53,22 June 2017
Elysium," Progessium
","The glorious, innocent, hard working people of Mexico live in squalor while providing everything for the rich, racist, evil Americans.This is a Hollyweird imagining of the illegal immigrant situation. Just to make sure you get it, a few extra touches are added.<ul><li>The ships the women and children use to try to get to Elysium for medical attention are called 'undocumented vessels'.</li></ul><ul><li>The women and children who get to Elysium for medical attention are called 'illegals'.</li></ul><ul><li>There's an odd twist on reality. In the real world, criminals, including rapists and murderers, enter America illegally. But in the movie, the evil, racist Elysium people employ rapists and murderers to kill the women and children who try to cross into America, er Elysium.</li></ul>It's more progressive fantasy from Hollyweird.",1,16,24,27 February 2017
The Wolverine," What Happened to Wolverine?
","The problem with this movie is how does the re-imagined Wolverine ever make a difference? He's barely able to hold his own with normal humans, and that's even when Wolverine has his healing powers. This guy has fought the likes of the Hulk. The 'The Wolverine' Wolverine wouldn't last a second against the Hulk.This is mostly a slow paced character movie, but it doesn't develop or reveal any interesting character.There's a guy desperate for immortality as he faces death. Wolverine is the immortal guy tired of life. Gee, those aren't too cardboard, are they? Why don't Wolverine's claws slice through swords? Why doesn't a super heated Adamantium sword cut through flesh? Why did the bad guys let Wolverine walk away from their control only to spend the rest of the movie trying to lure him back into their control?",4,1,2,28 December 2016
Deadpool," Unwatchable
","That's not an exaggeration. After the first 35 minutes I couldn't watch any more of it. So I jumped forward through most of the movie, watched part of the final fights, then fast fast fast forwarded through the end.The movie is full of rapid fire bad jokes, including lots of ball jokes. The story is told in a back and forth between the present and flash back, with the last few minutes moving forward to the end. The action scenes are full of slow motion and freezes. Deadpool constantly talks to the audience. It's bad movie making 101.The story is generic superhero origin - the bad guys give him super powers while at the same time messing him up. He gets revenge.It might have been watchable if it had less of the bad jokes and a straight line story. A decent story may have helped, but the story was good enough for an action movie.It must be millennials, stoners, or more likely stoned millennials who watched this movie to make it popular.",1,18,35,11 February 2017
