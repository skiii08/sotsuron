Mission: Impossible III," Enjoyable movie but wheres the intrigue? and wheres the big ending?
","Being the 3rd movie in the series I went into the movie with the required lowered expectations.This movie met my expectations in some departments while disappointed me in the others.The movie started out promisingly enough with a sequence involving the rescue of a kidnapped operative. We can see the reason why the retired cruise decides you come out of retirement.What really doesn't go down with me is that how nowadays all movies EVEN ACTION MOVIES ARE BEING DRIVEN BY LOVE. Are they no other emotions driving mankind, what about the simple action movies what about other sometimes stronger emotions such as greed, survival, patriotism, duty, revenge. Why are we subjected to movie after movie where the whole world revolves around love. It was cool in the first few films but its increasingly irritating that movie makers in order to appeal to a wider audience are force feeding romantic elements down your throat.To add to that we are forced to cope with Sensitive Action Heros, Strong Women Who rise to the occasion, the over predictable double cross, the faithful team, the oh so simple plot that is as clear as water. Whatever happened to complicated multiple double cross and multiple motivations driven plot where I actually know that people went to see it twice just because they didn't get it the first time. This movie is sanitised for my liking.The acting especially from Tom Cruise was top class he played the role of a returned special agent all to easily and for the first time and thankfully so looked his age. The rest of the cast which included some great fresh new faces especially Maggie Q were also great making this all to plain movie slightly better.Hats off to Philip Seymour Hoffman who sent chills down my spine as a menacing arms dealer without the theatrics. He somehow achieved this effect merely by saying things as unemotionally as possible and looking at Tom Cruise with no expression in his face. Just the coldness in his eyes and words were enough to make him a memorable screen villain.The plot was to simple to be mentioned and the direction was top class but just good as any other A-list Hollywood movie. The locations were again run of the mill and nothing worth mentioning.Special scenes were the opening sequence with the daring rescue which ends surprisingly. Clearly the best scene was the attack on the bridge on Tom Cruise. The scene had some great action and mind boggling special effects.The movie lacked the big ending that we have come to associate with the series. The thankfully eliminated the predictable IMPOSSIBLE HEIST but I would have still liked to see a bigger better more exciting ending.In all a good package that will unfortunately or fortunately appeal to all audiences. Liberally scattered with some great scenes that keep you interested throughout.Watchable with lowered expectations.+s a memorable screen villain, great acting and cast, a couple of great scenes, fast pace, complete package, Doesn't Disappoint DESPITE THE HYPE,watched it half price in the morning show hehe -s tooooooo simple, toooooo predictable, no big ending, complete package, NOTHING NEW TO OFFER.total 6/10 (however if seen in absolute terms its a 4 but considering lowered expectations reaches a 6)",6,16,30,12 June 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Great blend of old vintage wines in a brand new bottle.
","I was waiting to see this movie in the theaters but unfortunately I was unable to, thus when I saw the shiny new DVD in the Just Arrived section I new I had to see this movie. The comparisons Tarantino and the like immediately got me thinking though, Im no fan of Tarantino but I've seen enough of his movies to know that even though he trys to do something different every time his movies are actually quite predicable, further comparisons to other great movies had me convinced that this movie is not as brilliant as it seems but is in fact blend of many vintage wines (or malts) and such efforts are usually quite futile, yet I was hooked so I lowered my expectations and rented the movie.The movie starts of brilliantly but when the first sequence is over you already know that this is a significant part of the movie (as the filmmakers makers want you to know), however even the less die-hard movie goers will easily be able to predict the final outcome of the movie, and have a very good idea about the flow of the movie just based on this sequence, I'm sure the filmmakers didn't take that into account while making the movie.The movie has Tarantino-ish flow about it, in fact most of the elements are inspired from other brilliant films:- 1)The warring gang bosses are as old as the hills.2)Playing them against each other is just as old (spagetti westerns).3)Bruce Willis is a cool assassin (need i say more).4)A movie that starts with one event and culminates into another.Sound familiar these concepts are just some of the concepts that have been used in this movie and have been the premise of many super-hit/ cult favourites etc etc of our times.Like I said such mixing of vintages has generally resulted in disaster (AVP) but in this case surprisingly the end result is actually quite pleasing in fact the movie borders on brilliant for the most part, HOWEVER PREDICTABILITY ENSURES THAT THIS MOVIE EASILY FALLS SHORT OF BRILLIANT, and Hollywood's obsession of love to has a strong part to play in this department.The acting is brilliant all around, the effort to be cool in every scene which is the greatest acting flaw in many such movies (Samuel L Jackson prime candidate in many of his latest movies) is not noticed here.It has however become annoying to Bruce Willis in the same cool and silent role, I don't think id want to see him in a similar role again.The cinematography and editing is again top notch and matches up to many other brilliant works.The background score is hardly felt and hardly needed.On all technical aspects this movie is nearly flawless ( initially i wasn't to happy with the casting of Lucy Lu but I've changed my mind since).There are a couple of minor plot holes but these are insignificant.There is a constant feeling of humour in this film, much like the Protagonist's are experiencing despite the graveness of the situation (this is something i always identify with and enjoy so i may be biased).In the end you cant help feeling that even though you enjoyed the blend (movie) there were really nothing new about it, all the flavours were known to you, you knew what to expect, and the after taste (climax) which is what this movie is all about is almost lost because you are so familiar with it.This is a rare case of a great blend (Black Label?) and for that it will be cherished.A must watch if you are a fan of Tarantino, Westerns, Crime, Bruce Willis or any other concept or actor involved with this film.+s a rare great blend, flawless technically, superb acting, good humour.+/s great blend but blend nevertheless, does the effort show (i don't think so).-s predictable, never really hits you, why does it always have to involve love.total 8/10 (in absolute terms its more like a 7/7.5 but really I expected less plus I always enjoy humour in grave situations hence the higher rating)",8,12,25,4 January 2007
Requiem for a Dream," Brilliant film making for film makings sake! No entertainment
","This movie is another one of those art house movies that are works of modern art. Most people either don't like it or they don't, and they claim they do, so that it looks like they appreciate art, and thus don't seem like ignorants in front of other people who found it as stupid as they did in the first place. even if you didn't understand that the point is the movie has no point. there are much better movies on drugs out there. the only reason this movie is watchable is that it has some brilliantly conceptualized and shot scenes and that for some strange reason i knew what was going to happen and just wanted to make sure it did. a good film maybe if you are a film student but worthless as entertainment. watch it if you like these art house kind of movies.",4,3,6,6 January 2006
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Lacks the big moments.....not the kind of raunchy that most men enjoy
","I've seen more Adult comedies than most people.There are certain things people like me expect from such movies.1) gratuitous female nudity/ non nude titillation.2) A reasonable script which can even be based on regular events like parties, vacations, college life.3)Hot chicks.4) At least one thing about the movie being big, be it a premise or a scene or even a dialogue.Luckily there are many of us out there who share similar tastes and there is a steady state movies that fit the above which get released year after year.Every once in a while there comes a movie that most of the above but tries to something more.....and sometimes it doesn't really do much for the film.This film is all about Jason, to the point that you just don't want to see him anymore. Lets face it he just doesn't have it yet for us to see so much of him....literally.Which bring us to the other talking point of this film, male nudity, it probably served it purpose to create the stir that it was supposed to create , but when you see it in the context of the film, it really seems totally unnecessary, especially towards the end when it actually turns redundant to the point of annoying. When you couple that with the lack of titillating scenes involving females the disappointment starts knocking of stars.The other thing about this movie is the lack of the BIG, even the most regular adult comedies will have a premise or a dialogue or a scene which will remain in your memory for years to come and this movie just doesn't have them.But this movie does have what you will expect from its Apatowish cast.Well written characters and script (loved Russell brand).Witty if not hilarious dialogue.Elements of the hopeless romantic (its more rom com than adult comedy).Decent Acting all around.It just doesn't have what it takes to be above good despite what the ratings suggest.",6,1,4,30 January 2014
Rang De Basanti," A great movie but a very disappointing end.
","I really went in this movie with great apprehensions, i expected another one of Aamir Khans egoistical and narcissist movies where the only thing he cares for is himself and everything else be damned. Also a lot of people really loved this movie and I'm not a big fan of others choice for movies, especially the way people are so obsessed with dramas (hell i had a guy tell me this is a film and not a movie whats the difference dumbass!!).Well....this movie is a drama and it is another egoistical attempt by Aamir to make his version of bhagat singh and make it work where others failed. Yes he does play a 27 year(max) old when there are 1 billion people who know he is over 40, but despite that this movie is great in the first half.One of the reasons i didn't give this movie a higher rating is that I'm one of those crazy patriotic Indians who believes that India was and is the best country in the world etc etc. and i know i liked this movie much more because of its high dose of patriotism. Also i know this movie may have been meant to target the urban Indian audience who all know English but i don't understand the obsession of using only English titles and credits ill always minus one rating for that only.That brings us to the worst part of the movie. The end . It was highly stupid predictable and quite irritating and although it couldn't succeed in ruining a damn good movie it tried really hard.Other than these things the movie is lovely the acting especially from the junior actors is great even the foreigner is not that bad. Special mention should go to The guy from style he is really turning out to be quite a lovable actor.Go watch this film!!! Jai Hind.",7,3,10,18 February 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Is this the movie that has the biggest opening of all time??!!!
","YES IT DOES... this movie has the biggest opening in movie history and I have a theory as to why that is so.....Besides being one of the most expensive movie ever made it is BY FAR THE MOST EXTENSIVELY MARKETED FILM OF ALL TIME, the marketing budget of this film alone is 150 million dollars......unfortunately that proves that however ordinary the movie is if you force the people to see it they will, and then say they love just because thats what everyone it saying. Also unfortunate is that, this now turning into a trend with most of the newer big budget films being strictly OK (superman recently).As almost everyone did I went into this movie expecting a good time and nothing more, but this movie was STRICTLY OK !! Despite the fact that I lowered my expectations to factor in the fact that this is nothing but a fun movie.The story is boring, humdrum AND HAS At least A DOZEN PLOT HOLES, fans of the earlier movie and the ride will point out at least a dozen more.The Story is completely unidimensional and is unable to justify the length of the movie.Heres how a sequence in the movie is ....'The giant creature is attacking................hmmm cool graphics, OK now what......the giant creature is attacking again............OK so now what................hell the creature just attacked again..........at least a dozen scenes have been unnecessarily added. I think one day the editor went for a nap and never came back.The acting was one department where this movie excelled, Johnny Depp as expected was great, HE HAS CERTAIN FLAIR ON SCREEN WHICH IS VERY ENTICING AND UNIGNORABLE (you can love him or you can hate him but you cant ignore him), the supporting cast including Bloom, Jack Davenport (the guy from coupling), and the 2 stooges was brilliant. The only complaint was from Keira who doesn't have the flair to play a pirate/fugitive.The 2 stooges were absolutely hilarious and provided some of the best comic moments of the movie.Again this movie has been made to please the entire range of demographics, (this means we have bumbling Indian Pirate which is historically true also but good), but that also means that Orlando Bloom will unnecessarily be stripped ALA Salman Khan, there is adult oriented humour, A F@#$ING LOVE TRIANGLE (MAYBE QUADRANGLE), hell as usual this movie has been voted higher by women then men.The special effects were absolutely mind boggling, (not any scene but the scale , nearly 1 in 2 scenes have computer generated elements in them), you cannot tell whether they are sets, or robotic costumed, or CG.The ending of the movie was probably the biggest disappointment with the last 15- 20 mins being very boring. Lets face it THIS IS NO EPIC and I cant why the movie-makers are trying to make one.In all movie that can best be described as STRICTLY TIMEPASS, you are assured a good time BUT YOU LEAVE THE THEATER FEELING THAT YOU HAVE BEEN BULLIED IN TO SEEING IT.+s great cast and acting, superb animation, 2 stooges, good humour +/-s Keira Knightley -s overdone and overused animation, loooooooooong, humdrum story, no real action, feeling that you have been forced to see it because of the hype.total 5/10 (only because I laughed a lot but I'm torn between honesty and promoting such ordinary film-making)",5,3,6,25 July 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Near perfect film for children, but really great for all ages!!!
","When I rented this movie I had already heard so much about the movie and was skeptical as I generally don't end up enjoying movies with to much hype.Also I had missed the movie in the theaters and was really excited when i got this DVD almost the next day after it released.This movie will be one of the rare movies where you expect the world and end up getting it. Everything about the movie is great and save for a one or 2 I cannot see any flaws in it.The acting is excellent and I'm not to sure whether the plastic expressions of Edmund were intentional or because he is a bad actor but the fit perfectly with the mood he should have been throughout the film.The setting of the film is in fantasy and even though some scenes reek of LOTR and New Zealand the fantasy world of Narnia has been masterfully created.A special winner is the background score of the film which was brilliant and was further enhanced with some great mixing on the home-theater enhanced sound on the DVD.The old fashioned values that are taught in this film (sacrifice, family bonding, hope) are endearing to people of all ages and are far better than the stupid cartoons that are being dished out today(spongebob , squarepants ).The only thing that annoyed me was the quality of the action towards the end of the film which could have been much better considering the pg-13 certificate (i can never understand why they freak out in fight scenes when whats really disturbs the children are the sexual themes in movies even with pg-13, i mean we watched cartoons where people fought and killed every time and were no homicidal maniacs).Save for that this film is a perfect family potboiler with loads of hope, scary scenes, funny scenes , inspiring scenes etc etc etc.A must watch for all ages and a far better film for children then say a Harry Potter.You have to watch this film.",9,1,1,26 April 2006
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Nearly flawless animated movie (PG) delivers its maximum potential.
","Starting with expectations I didn't really expect the world from this movie, just the same lovable characters (all the characters are back including some great new ones), a whole lot of PG rated jokes and maybe one or two really funny moments, peppered with a few emotional moments that are the staple of such films.And this movie met every one of those expectations and in some cases even exceeded them.Also this is ONE of the rare sequels that are as good if not better than the original and that in itself makes this movie extra special.The animation of this movie is top notch and save for the fact that they make the fire and water too realistic in some scenes it had the perfect feel of a old fashioned cartoon film.The acting is superb and besides the earlier characters this movie introduces 3 great characters namely a scamming armadillo (jay Leno at his best) and two over-smart possums. I didn't seem to care to much for Ellie the mammoth (queen latifah has become way to monotonous i knew it was her without even seeing the credits).The background score of the film is great and certainly adds to beauty of this film.The jokes are hilarious and extremely well thought of, with a liberal dose of jokes that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and a few select jokes that will seem funnier to adults. This is a great concept in modern films where some jokes are tailor made adults so they can find them much funnier.Surprisingly this movie keeps you laughing throughout even though it doesn't have any scenes that will have you rolling out of your seats (thus lacks any scenes you can put your finger on a rarity in funny films).The old fashioned concepts of love and brotherhood do make their expected appearances but they are short and sweet and fit brilliantly in the film. In fact they are explained mostly through humour and this makes this film a near perfect family entertainer(going with a girl is also not a bad idea as they seem to love such films).A rare great sequel, a film that exceeds expectations and delivers to its maximum potential. This movie is an absolute must see.",9,2,2,26 April 2006
Oldboy," Great movie even though i had seen the Hindi remake (zinda) i thoroughly enjoyed this film.
","I admit after seeing the Hindi remake of this film (Zinda) i went into this movie expecting the world, shockingly so this movie actually lived up to almost all its expectations.I thought that the concepts in the Hindi movie were hard hitting but these movie is gut wrenching, squirming, mind bending etc etc all in one.I always suspected the end but when it actually happened, i was shocked and still stomach churned. It makes Hollywood revenge flicks look like children's play games.The acting, music and film-work was top notch. The movie really is a cinematic masterpiece and the only reason why is not rated higher by me is because i still prefer the masala (spice) variety of films and i definitely had hoped for a lot more stylish hard hitting action from this film.Also i would have liked the confrontation in the end between the 2 protagonists to have been different but the way it is also adds to the beauty of this film.All in all a great film, but i could have done with a little more action. Please watch this movie.",8,3,54,14 March 2006
Superbad," Confused feelings but fun nevertheless....
","I had heard about this movie when it came out in the theatres, but knowing fully well that will never get a theatrical release here in India i kind of forgot about it.Then I came across the DVD and since it was a name i recognised i got it. I didn't expect much really other than standard Jude Appatow/Steve Carrel humour mixed with some standard teen comedy.What I've noticed with Jude is that he always evokes confused feelings, one side you will have pretty accurate description of how people look, feel and behave and at the same time you will have over the top and slapstick characters. The same movie will have thought provoking moments as well have moments that are so over the top, that they annoy.Well in this case its mixed with the teen movie formula, there's always the fat guy, the super nerd, the guy who's a semi-nerd but is actually going to become cool (most of whom are virgins), underage drinking, YOU KNOW THE DRILL.What Jude does is add a slight twist to the genre, which is sometime satirical, sometimes slapstick, sometimes just plain funny, and at others just plain irritating or boring.The acting is fine from the entire cast, especially good is Mintz as Mclovin, even the girls who are unfortunately not that hot have done a fine job (another example of accurate representation no 25-35 yr old hotties playing teens here).The background score was ordinary enough to be missed.Direction, cinematography etc don't really matter that much with such subject matter and was pretty standard.The humour was subtle sometimes and over the top on many others, the abusive language had novelty value in '40 year old' but has completely lost its charm here, the one liners are OK,ITS MUCH MORE ABOUT THE WHOLE DIALOGUE HERE THAN ONE LINERS.There are some really good scenes like the liquor store, and the entire Mclovin Cops saga, but there were many ordinary scenes like the gangs, and couple of the ending sequences.THE MOVIE DOES FEEL KIND OF SPACED OUT MUCH LIKE KEVIN SMITH'S MOVIES, In fact SOMETIMES I GET THE FEELING THAT I AM INDEED WATCHING A KEVIN SMITH FILM.Which bring us the MOST IMPORTANT PART EXPECTATIONS, I really didn't know that this movie was once in the 'Top 250', if had watched this movie with those expectations needless to say i would have been very disappointed, i watched it expecting merely good hence i enjoyed this movie, I'm sure PEOPLE OTHER THAN FANS WILL REALLY BE DISAPPOINTED IF THEY WATCH WITH VERY HIGH EXPECTATIONS.Fans and people who like such humour as shown by Steve Carell, Jude, Kevin Smith, will really like this movie others may enjoy it if they don't expect too much,THOSE THAT LIKE STANDARD AND SIMPLE COMIC FARE (like me) HAVE A VERY HIGH CHANCE OF BEING DISAPPOINTED (luckily i wasn't).Im not that sure girls will like this movie either.Watch with due considerations.-s some really annoying/gross/boring scenes, weak stereotypical end, NO REALLY BIG FUNNY SCENE.+/-s humour gets a bit spaced out sometimes,not exactly short in length.+s the entire Mclovin Cops sequence, good acting, SOME REALLY GOOD DIALOGUES.total 7/10 ( but thats only because i didn't expect much and it met my expectations, i wont lie that I'm tempted to be dishonest and put a low rating just to pull down the overall ratings, I CAN ENJOY THIS HUMOUR FOR A CHANGE ONCE IN A WHILE BUT GIVE ME SIMPLE HUMOUR ANYDAY).",7,0,3,28 December 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Not as bad as I expected it to be..
","Same year another sequel the first of the big sequels in the 'year of the sequels', having not yet figured out the sequels so far, but knowing fully well that I would eventually end up watching this movie i decided to watch it the weekend of its release.As I was about to enter the theater I received a call from my friend who had just watched the previous show, that this movie was a disaster and even worse than Part 2.I froze in fear nothing could be worse than Part 2, that 3 hr+ script-less debacle was clearly rock bottom (considering the budget), the only way was up wasn't it? Still I scaled my expectations down to rock bottom took gods name and entered the theater.Well I was right, this was indeed better than part 2, but I have a stinking feeling my rock bottom expectations had a lot to do with it.For starters Part 2 wasn't 3hr+(it certainly felt like it) it was 150 min this ones 168 but still felt only 168 min long.The movie is still script-less, multiple ideas, multiple scenes, and multiple gags have been stitched together in one editing and storytelling disaster, PLOT HOLES and continuity be damned.Yet this movie pull through, mainly on the basis of continued good performances from the main cast and the continuing antics of some of the new characters, as well the 'sideys' that have been upgraded (laurel and hardy pirate duo).The jokes and one liners are still funny, and the attention paid to individual scenes ensure that although the entire package is strictly OK some of the scenes are breathtaking in their scale and really funny.The acting and soundtrack is once again up there and technically too this movie is as sound as any movie with this budget should be.Even the finest ingredients can give an ordinary dish if the recipe is bad or the execution is messed up.Even here the movies tosses up decent moments but the overall package rises just above tolerable.Some memorable scenes are the pirates meeting and the rescue of jack sparrow.The dialogues still are the highlight of this series (and some extent the budget and related big scenes) and even here they don't disappoint, lots of memorable dialogues help to carry this film through.Any attempt at logic and looking for continuity or plot holes will only lead to misery.A idea with enough content for a ride was made into 3 films and I'm embarrassed that I'm not man enough not to resist the hype.IF YOU DO FEEL COMPELLED TO WATCH IT THEN PLEASE DO SO WITH ROCK BOTTOM EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT IS UNEMOTIONALLY THIS MOVIE IS REALLY ONE BAD PIECE OF CINEMA.-s no script whatsoever, lots of bad patches, TO MUCH FOCUS KIERA KNIGHTLY.+/-s responsibility is shared by the cast, not as much focus on Depp.+s some really good moments that are spread throughout, superb technical values, acting, soundtrack,SUPERB DIALOGUES ONCE AGAIN.total 5/10 (factoring in absolute rock bottom expectations which were exceeded, detailed analysis will only make this movie go from OK to bad to worst, which was not what i felt when i walked out of this movie, i felt it was OK thats the part I've tried to focus on).",5,0,2,16 June 2007
Spider-Man 3," Something for everyone.....not much for anyone!!!
","Im an avid moviegoer, save for the odd low-budget or independent film i watch only commercial cinema be it from any country, needless to say I was eager to watch this movie before anyone and since my friend is in movie distribution I was invited for the preview of the film.I was really excited when i saw the previews and even though I was well aware of the demographic appeasement policy of the studios, i didn't scale my expectations down by too much, I'm easily satisfied no amount of material could take away the pleasure of watching such awe-inspiring special effects....Or so I thought!!!Heres the part where I justify the summary (guessing the demographics and their tastes take with a pinch of salt).THE FANS - They will love the little details in this movie, cram enough facts and names in any comic movie and they will have an orgasm, any adherence to the comics will earn brownie points with them and from my research I've learned that movie has remained very true to the comic universe and even clear some plot holes from the earlier films.BUT whatever happened to the secret identity at least few thousand people know by now who spider-man is, and by killing of so many characters (goblin for one) they are definitely going to lose some advantage.STILL THIS IS WILL BE THE SECOND MOST SATISFIED DEMOGRAPHIC.THE CRITICS - Satisfying them is even easier than the fans prerequisites are 1) The movie should be long (140 mins in this case) however exceptions are allowed for foreign language films which are all good.2)There should be long boring parts with lots of conversations and deep emotional moments, crying is a must AND BOY IS THERE CRING SPIDERMAN IS CRYING, MJ IS CRYING, HARRY IS CRYING, AUNT IS CRYING, HELL EVEN THE DEAD UNCLE IS CRYING, all this is OK right how else do you please the drama lovers BUT WAIT THERE IS MORE...NOW THE BLOODY Villains ARE CRYING MAN VENOM IS CRYING GOBLIN IS CRYING AND EVEN SANDMAN IS CRYING even apologising for gods sake.ACTING WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE CONSIDERED SUPERB IF THESE CRITERIA ARE MET.BUT it is a big studio movie and with loads of action and special effects that distract from the interesting story of man torn between his 2 lives(sic) hence they wont give the super high rating.Still this will be third happiest demographic.THE ORDINARY MOVIEGOER (alomst me)- We don't really care about the details keep us interested for 105 mins and we are happy, add in some more special effects, some more twists, some more drama and some more eye candy and even 120 mins will do.BUT this movie is 140+ mins there are long stretches of drama and only these many big action scenes and not to mention no eye candy (KIRSTEN LOOKS HIDEOUS).This demographic will be satisfied for now BUT NOT FOR LONG.THE OPINIONATED AND NOSTALAGIC COMMERCIAL MOVIEGOERS - We long for more movies of the kind we like (in my case the simple action movies of the yesteryear's the good guys were good, the bad guys were bad and bloodshed always followed, in between there was some drama, some hot chicks, and some sorrow but in the end the bad guy lost and there were celebrations), IN THIS CASE THIS MOVIE WILL NOT FIT INTO ANYONES IDEAL COMMERCIAL MOVIE.BUT There are once again a fair number of awe-inspiring effects and 6-7 good scenes and we will never really find this movie bad (still gave the lower rating to discourage such movies and not raise expectations).GREAT COMIC SCENE IN THE RESTAURANT.We will be satisfied but have loads of opinions.BLACKS WILL RAISE A CRY ABOUT THE LACK OF BLACK ACTORS IN THIS MOVIE (eventually).AND NOW FOR THE MOST SATISFIED DEMOGRAPHIC.THE CHICKS - If ever there was a chick flick that was parading as an action film this was one.. 1) All the men are sensitive (a less offensive word) and cry (read earlier) women will get MULTIPLE ORGASMS SEEING SUPERSTRONG SENSITIVE MEN. 2)The women are strong characters with loads of advise which turns out to be true, all of them are loved by their men, HELL THEY EVEN ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO THROW A CONCRETE BLOCK TO SAVE Their MAN. 3)There are more kisses, romantic, and tearful moments then the most romantic film ever made.YAY SPIDERMAN IS DANCING.BUT Some people died and they should have reformed and lived liked that other villainStill women WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE.Must stop rambling so heres the verdict.If you will give in to the hype then PROCEED WITH CAUTION.-s read above, CHICK FLICK, not enough satisfying action, too much demographic appeasement,LONG BORING STRETCHES.+/-s CHICK FLICK, you could be in the right demographic.+s decent acting,MIND BOGGLING SPECIAL EFFECTS, something for everyone.total 4/10 (actually its more of a 5-6/10 movie but want to discourage such movies and pull down the hyper inflated rating, it met my highly lowered expectations).",4,3,7,4 May 2007
Resident Evil: Extinction," Bring on No. 4.......
","As I go through the 3rd film in the franchise 3 things have become extremely clear to me.1)The movies have improved after outing specially on the technical aspects like acting, direction special effects etc.2)The sequels always promise more and deliver less.3)The potential is increasingly underutilized.Which means that although technical aspects have improved after every movie, the net rating of every movie has been roughly the same thanks to the last 2 points.I find it hard to believe that even though this is no.3 after I see the end im actually looking forward to the sequel a trend which I've observed in all the 3 films.All this being said lets not forget that this is out and out mod-high budget Action/Horror flick which is obviously more suited to the guys, the element of horror is also increasingly decreasing through each sequel, again a case of not living upto its potential (a post apocalyptic zombie infected planet was perfect for genuine horror moments).If any one expects more than a few great action scenes, good special effects and a few hot chicks from such movies than hes a fool.This movie starts with promise and remains within a band throughout the movie except for the climax where it lets down, for the first time in the franchise. However the absolute end has me even more excited the previous ones for the sequel.Milla looks good in a role she has made her own, like everyone else many of whom a reprising their roles from the earlier films.The acting was good all around, nothing special here and none was expected.Most of the scenes were good, ones that really stood out was the failed rescue attempt and the fight in Vegas.Other than that this movie moved along at a leisurely pace which is really why it should have excelled in the horror department and maybe with some better dialogues, even some scientific mumbo jumbo/delving a bit into the 'pseudo universes' history would have actually made it more interesting.The soundtrack was good once again and well used.I wonder how much the tobacco lobby (if there is indeed one) contributed to the budget of this film??Despite the fact that i always expect something from this franchise, given its simple no-nonsense approach to entertainment, this is the 3rd film and I always expect at best what i got in the earlier movie (which more than what i expect from most sequels).There is perverse pleasure in seeing things being killed/killing things when there are no strings attached (your doing the people a favour by killing them you see) and zombie movies/video-games have cashed on this for decades.Fans will continue to enjoy this film, while there is something for the first time watchers.People who love to find goofs, plot holes and continuity errors will have field day in this movie. It is advised to stay away from these activities, or only indulge in them in the slightly less interesting parts of the film.If you are a fan you can pay premium rates, otherwise a DVD rental or cheaper rates are recommended.-s OK dialogue almost no horror, delivers much less than it promises, lackluster end, wasted potential, lacks the frantic pace of the earlier movies.+/-s WHAT ELSE DO YOU EXPECT??!!!.+s some really good scenes, once again promises a great sequel, everyone does a good job, technically sound, well used soundtrack.total 6/10 ( i mean you cant really expect more, I would have given it more for meeting expectations but it would have been detrimental.

","Lets see where this movie excels that puts it in the best movies of all time.1) Special effects.2)Iconic Comic book hero.3)Quick lipped sidekick.4)Big name actors.5)Hot girl with a sultry voice.Surely this is a formula that the world hasn't seen since Superman, Batman, Hulk, Avengers, Thor....But this movie has so much more..1) An iconic villain/enforcer/mercenary who seems so scary in posters, who could have remained silent the entire film and scared the crap out of us but instead speaks only confused lines as if hes about to burst into tears.2)Twists that are so predictable that you needn't even show off about getting them.3) Chemistry between the characters that could have simmered , boiled, titillated ....given us the awwwwwwww.......but gave the ummmmmmmm instead.4) Part of an increasingly entwined and rich universe, but with focus on quantity and not quality, 3 villains 2 henchmen, numerous other smaller characters.I seriously cant think even one other film that can match the above parameters.*****end of sarcasm******.There's nothing in this movie that makes it deserving of such a high rating.I was entertained hence the 6 but quite disappointed at the film-makers for just touching many right areas instead of focusing on a few.-s too many things happening at one time, altogether un-iconic villains/henchmen (a superhero film is only as good as its villains, boring predictable twists, no epic scenes.+/-s touched on too many right areas without focusing on them.+s stellar cast, excellent (but par) special effects, good addition to the marvel universe.",6,0,1,28 April 2014
Ocean's Thirteen," A perfect 'Good Sequel'.....
","One things for sure this is 'the year of the sequels' and you only need one look at the big movies this year to agree with me, whats even more surprising is the number on the sequels, trilogies are the new flavour of the decade, what was once the right of only the greatest and most groundbreaking films (and offcourse the most B-rated), is now the birthright of every other movie.Whats even more surprising is that the trend has finally managed to catch the attention of mainstream movies everywhere, even British and Indian cinema where sequels were few and far between now have sequels to big films (Dhoom2, 28 weeks later).NOt surprising then I found myself watching yet another sequel, and no matter what they say there was no way i was going to allow myself to expect anything more than ordinary for this movie especially in the light of Oceans 12 and the other sequels this summer.Like other sequels this one has also taken the safe root by banking on the stars and characters created by the earlier movies instead of focusing on the script.The characters have been given so much credit that this is almost not a heist film.Not that im complaining, the dialogues were hilarious, the quirks of every character kept you interested throughout, the hilarious interplay between characters is what makes this film with a one page plot watchable.Other than the big stars, the main character for me was Casey Affleck has the hilarious Malloy, he was the best thing for me in this movie and the hilarious Mexican Fiasco around him made the movie for me.However no credit must be taken from the others and this being a character based film, everyone has risen to the part and done a good job.Acting obviously is top-notch with some hamming that can be ignored if you see this movie as the character based comic caper that it is, dialogues are hilarious in all scenes even if they don't matter.Technical aspects are OK, the plot being wafer thin, and the heist taking a back seat, the few special effects that are there are tastefully done especially the rendering of the hotel in Vegas.The movie has loads of plot holes, useless scenes and sub-plots, like the one with french thief which i didn't figure out till the end, AMPLE SEQUEL PREPARATION WILL ENSURE SUCH OTHERWISE IMPORTANT THINGS Don't SPOIL YOUR MOVIE.The lesser said about the con the better, its not important in the film and not worth discussing here either, as a heist film this movie would s^&*.Background score was very effective with the songs really complimenting the scenes.Comparisons with the original are useless and will only spoil this movie and this review.In all a good sequel if you go with the correct expectations and realise the true nature of this film.PLEASE Don't BE MISLEAD BY THE HIGH RATINGS THAT MERELY REFLECT THE FACT THAT THIS IS In fact THE BEST OF THE SEQUELS THIS YEAR NOT THE ACTUAL QUALITY OF THE MOVIE.Give in to the hype and watch this movie.-s loads of plot holes and useless sub-plots and scenes, the con takes a back seat and is badly executed, not a heist film, some acting could be called hamming,MYSTERY INTRIGUE AND TENSION ARE NON-Existent.+/-s quirky character based comedy caper with the background of a heist, hilarious unrelated scenes (oprah and all), good sequel almost different genre.+s top-notch acting (considering the type of film), few but good special effects not at all jarring, lots of really humorous scenes and dialogues, very good background score.total 6.5/10 (7/10 factoring in expectations which was strictly OK. i expected a six and got slightly more, albeit from a different kind of film, please don't expect a good heist film or you may be disappointed. expect less get more).",6,1,2,13 June 2007
28 Weeks Later," Like having your favourite food again and again and .....
","Another day another sequel, in this case a sequel to a brilliant film made by a brilliant director, i seriously questioned why a person like Danny Boyle would fall for the sequel bandwagon, but obviously everything has a price, or better still he really believed in this movie.1 minute into this movie i was both disappointed and relieved, NO DANNY BOYLE Didn't DIRECT THIS FILM, so i knew i would get a lesser product and at the same time i was relieved that at least some person was willing to hold out from the exploitation sequels.The premise of the movie is as old as the mountains, obviously no infection ever stays controlled and there's always more guns, more running, and multiple enemies, not the mention the elusive miracle cure.OBVIOUSLY ORIGINALITY POINTS ARE ZERO.The shots of an abandoned London which blew me away in '28 days', didn't quite have the impact here even though there were done on larger scale, THIS MOVIE HAS ALMOST NO NEW IDEAS TO OFFER.But you still cannot take away the cinematic and entertainment value of this movie..The movie starts of tense and never ever lets up, even in moments of supposed calm you know something is going to wrong and you never ever feel in the comfort zone, THIS MOVIE Doesn't HAVE THOSE JUMP AND LAUGH AFTERWARDS SCENE BUT IS PUMPED WITH TENSION AND DESPAIR.A lot of the credit for the feel of this movie should go to the background score, its ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT, simple tunes and instruments, are used to create a haunting effect, the music moves with the mood, and enhances every feeling that you feel.ONCE AGAIN A PROJECT INVOLVING DANNY BOYLE HAS FLAWLESS BACKGROUND SCORE.The cinematography is superb, although there have been nothing new to offer but every scene is handled with panache you can feel the fear in the dark, or the expanse of abandoned London, or the haphazard scuffle between inexperienced fighters who are often fighting desperately for their life.HERE TOO EVEN THERE WAS NOTHING THAT WAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE BUT YET OOZED OF QUALITY.The acting too was superb no extra melodrama, IN A MOVIE THAT HAD A LOT OF DRAMA, i normally hate drama and even though i didn't go as far as enjoying the drama in this movie, i was really OK with it, IF ANYTHING THE SLIGHTLY WEAK SCRIPT CAN BE BLAMED FOR THE WEAK SCENES.The 2 girls weren't bad looking either even though there is no semblance of sexuality its nice to see pretty girls instead of ugly ones.Think of your favourite food, have you ever had a time when you've had it again and again and again and even though your FAR FROM FED UP WITH IT YOU FEEL IT TASTES A LITTLE LESS BETTER Every time???...Well i love zombie flicks, i love the blood,the guns, the explosions, the tensions, AND YOU CAN NEVER NOT LIKE A FLAWLESS BACKGROUND SCORE LIKE THIS, but somehow after seeing so many zombie movies with variations of the same old stuff, the pleasure is decreasing.Yet hats off to the director and his team for doing such a fine job despite the lack of originality in the script and plot.Fans and first time watchers of the genre will definitely enjoy it, but be warned its much more of a tense thriller than it is a action flick unlike most zombie flicks.-s NOTHING NEW OR ORIGINAL,slightly weak script,PLOT HOLES.+/-s too much of the same good thing????..+s FLAWLESS BACKGROUND SCORE, very good acting, lots of tension, some decent special effects, SUPERB CINEMATOGRAPHY.total 7/10 (just too original to merit anything more, will not make tedious comparisons to the original but my favourite food syndrome was definitely at play here,do watch with correct expectations.)",7,1,1,27 December 2007
Over the Hedge," Have we found the perfect PG rated animated film ??!!!!
","Let me tell you I went into this movie with very high expectations. However I did prepare in advance by going with I felt was the right company THERE IS NOTHING LIKE GOING WITH GIRLS FOR A PG RATED ANIMATED FILM (especially if your a 23 yr old guy who likes such films trust almost all my guy friends will cry 100 times before seeing this movie).Finding the appropriate company I entered the theater fully expecting my to be letdown a little bit. BUT......This movie is one the rear movies that met my expectations in each and every department.1)The animation was the best in the industry the characters looked life like and still retained their cartoonish charm.2)The Humour had something in it for everybody AND I MEAN EVERYBODY, their was intelligent and thought provoking humour ( If it tastes this good it has to be good for you, the American greed etc etc), crude slap-stick humour (the dog chase scene and more), adult humour (find my nuts...., Artificial food, Au natural etc Surprisingly NOT ONE JOKE HIT UNDER THE BELT YET I'm SURE THEY WERE AUDLT JOKES AS ONLY ADULTS WOULD GET THEM (hell unlike some other animated movie you would actually be able to explain it to your kid without getting embarrassed or lying), humour for the teens and preteens ( Auto-homicide 3, bonus points, THE ABOSULUETELY HILARIOUS TAKE ON A POPULAR PRETEEN MOVIE/SERIAL ABOUT SPEED), universal humour ( The monopoly scene clearly displayed their understanding of human psyche),The spoofs (terminator, the way teen girls speak etc etc),You Get the Point Don't You.I'M SORRY BUT EACH AND EVERY DEMOGRAPHIC WAS THOUGHT OF AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I AM NOT COMPLAINING.3)The sound-effects and voice-overs were excellent special credit for Bruce Willis for trying such a different role ,but each and every person in this movie was memorable, HAMMY is heading for legendary status which will be comparable to THE RAT from Ice Age.4)The emotional scenes were expertly handled EVEN THE MOST PROFOUND SCENES WERE MADE IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE SMILE WAS NEVER WIPED OF YOUR FACE, yet somehow the importance of family values was clearly put across. There were the typical scenes where the girls went AWWWWWWWWWW but even those were cool and as I had come prepared I felt great about my foresight.5)The theater was filled a variety of people (even a burkha clad women with her children, and an elderly couple) and each and everyone was laughing a couple of scenes had me falling out of my seat.Now for the bad parts.................................I'm SORRY BUT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS FILM. I have scaled down the rating for only 2-3 unimportant reasons.1)This movie is no pioneer in animated films.2)I sure this movie will be loved by all but I'm not sure if it will THIS FUNNY FOR THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITH American CULTURE.3) Nothings Perfect (But i swear if I meet person over 40 who is not familiar with American culture and who claims he loved this movie I will upgrade this movie to a perfect ten).A must see movie no matter who you are or who you go with, however going with company that includes girls will ensure enjoyment as the oohs and aahs will add extra special effects hehe.Don't waste any more time and go watch this movie.+s absolutely everything +/-s can it actually be loved by every kind audience still looking for that answer.-s absolutely nothing total 9-9.9/10 cause nothings perfect.!!!!",9,0,0,20 July 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Commercial comedy meets quirky comedy........
","Even though in India its fully acceptable to loose the Big 'V' after marriage (no one really knows what happens though), but even here especially among the 'cooler' guys, as a 23 yr old virgin (can guys be virgins?), I will occasionally get the 'Are you mad' looks.At 40 even a person in India is considered weird and I was sure in the great land of America a similar situation would lead to nothing but laughs.And sure enough this movie was absolutely hilarious....Steve Carell did a brilliant job as the protagonist, the movie is not your normal run of the mill slapstick comedy but has the 'clerks' sort of feel to it and a similar background, also unlike most modern comedies that are very situation and event based this movie has off-beat humour that involves lots of funny situations when just a bunch of guys are talking.This makes the movie like a multi-genre comedy with a fair amount of character, situational and quirky-conversational comedy, also a small dose of satire.The rest of the cast to is excellent with some hilarious performances all around I particularly liked Gerry Bednob as the abusive salesclerk of Indian Origin.Technically the film was OK with nothing really standing out the background score was also nothing special.There are however does have some stretches of boring moments and not so funny scenes especially in the second half AT 133 MINS THE UNRATED VERSION MAY NOT BE OF EPIC LEGNTH BUT IS A GOOD HALF LONGER THAN MOST COMEDY FILMS.Most of the conversations are hilarious standalone and you will laugh every time you remember them but the sheer number of these (check the quotes to see what i mean) mean that after a while they don't have a similar impact on you.Besides the hilarious quotes and one-liners this movie has some hilarious scenes as well especially the speed-dating one.In all a great comedy with fair bit of all kinds of humour, that ironically gets hampered by the sheer number of hilarious conversations and some ordinary scenes towards the end. (would really be interested in seeing the theatrical version).DVD EXTRAS WOULD HAVE BEEN FUNNY AND GOOD BUT AGAIN THE SHEER NUMBER OF SIMILAR FUNNY MATERIAL RENDER THEM INEFFECTIVE.A must watch for all lovers of comedy, especially as sure-shot movie to watch as a change from your regular choice of comedies.-s some ordinary scenes towards the end, sheer number of hilarious conversations/quotes/one-liners that bump up the run-time (UNRATED).+/-s DVD extras, not a regular comedy.+s a truly multi-genre comedy, great to watch as a change, brilliant acting all around, lots of funny material (quates, characters,and situations).Total 8/10 (considering the fact that it met the high expectations probably be less liked by women as told to me by my sister and other girls).",8,1,2,15 April 2007
Quantum of Solace," James Bond is dead so why did i watch this?!!!!
","Yes i did watch this movie with a negative bias.I knew when i watched Casino Royale that the new guys in charge of bond has purposely changed as much as they could about the franchise with intent of widening its audience under the guise that bond had to change with the times.And even though i normally don't read normally read reviews before i watch a movie, in this case i made an exception because bond is one favourite franchises (others include the original star wars, indiana jones, and other classics of the 70s and 80s).And when i the reviews confirmed my suspicions about almost every sacred relic in the bond franchisee being destroyed I made up my mind not to see this movie.But humans are self destructive and i found myself in a theatre watching this movie.When bond didn't pounce and shoot at the beginning of the movie i knew i was in trouble.WITHOUT GETTING INTO DETAILS ITS SAFE TO SAY ALMOST EVERY BOND STEREOTYPE AND SIGNATURES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED IN THIS MOVIE.Its been said before and i repeat that this movie feels more like the bourne series than bond series, (which were very ordinary films compared to the books), which is no surprise considering that so many people from those movies find themselves here.The length allows for no story telling and it feels like a chapter in a book rather than an entire story.The lesser said about the villain the better gone are the days of the bond super villains who inspired as much interest as did bond, there is an attempt to resurrect spectre in this movie but given the new teams ruthless attempts at changing everything i don't see many positives there either.The villain feels like a puny lackey than a menacing ganglord whos worthy of bond.AND They've TAKEN OUT THE INTERESTING AND Powerful STRONGMAN AWAY TOO.I CAN KEEP ON RAVING ABOUT HOW THE MAKERS HAVE A BIGGER BOURNE HANGOVER THAN MAKING A BOND FILM BUT WILL REQUIRE PAGES AND CAUSE AN EMOTIONAL BRAKEDOWN.So lets get to the good parts.Miss fields looks gorgeous but is compensated to some degree by the normally vexing olga looking ordinary.Even though the action scenes feel like bourne some of them are quite good especially if you like the shaky camera which im not too found off.The acting is top class as far as standalone acting goes but lacks the flamboyance and flare that came to be associated with bond.Not a single character can be termed as interesting.IM STILL COMPLAING IT SEEMS TO STRAIGHT TO THE CONCLUSION.FOR THE CLASSICAL ROMANTICS THIS MOVIE IS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.FOR THOSE WHO CELEBRATE CHANGE REGARDLESS OF ITS RESULTS THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE.FOR THOSE WHO WATCH IT LIKE ANY OTHER MOVIE ITS MERELY OK.Please proceed with extreme caution if you fall in the first category.-s bond is dead, lousy villains, no character is interesting, no storytelling.+/-s shaky camera, how much change is good????.+s good acting for any other movie, some good action scenes.total 4/10 ( factoring in the fact that it fell below my expectations however if i fully factor in how much this movie has disturbed me I would have given a much lower rating, please watch this movie as any other spy action flick if you wish to derive maximum pleasure from it, I STILL WISH THOUGH I HADNT WATCHED THIS FILM).",4,6,8,6 December 2008
Ghost Rider," In preparation for the sequel that i hope never comes...
","I really find it hard to believe how someone can expect more than ordinary, for a movie where the main character is a skeleton on fire, CG has come a long way but even if we ever reach the stage where real actors can be replaced by Animated ones there is no way you can extract more than this much facial expressions from a flaming skull.For the reasons stated above i went into the movie expecting nothing more than a 5, and this movie didn't for once look like it was going to cross that figure.From the beginning you know that this movie is going to be as cheesy as it gets, even big fans of extra cheese like me (i like B-movies) will find it hard to digest the corny scenes and stereotypical dialogues that this movie has (hell sometimes you can predict it to last pause), any hope this movie had of rising above the ordinary is thrown away in the scene where Peter Fonda makes his appearance as the devil.From then on this movie follows with one ordinary scene to the other, it felt like the entire movie was like walking of top of a wall, however it always felt that like the movie would fall on the wrong side not once did it look like this movie would fall on the right side and then breakaway from the ordinary.The dialogues are corny, the computer graphics are ordinary (IN A TIME WHERE CG RENDERED STUNTS ARE GETTING MORE AND MORE OUTRAGEOUS, showing us stunts that may be yet attempted by Robbie Knievel, using CG don't even extract an ounce of excitement). The rest of the stunts are equally ordinary not a single one is worth a mention, to add to that the CLIMAX IS AS ORDINARY AS IT GETS.Save for the presence of Nicholas Cage this movie would have made a great B-movie.Shockingly the acting to is completely ordinary Nicholas plays a spaced out character that would have been better suited in movies like mall-rats, clerks etc. Not a single character rises above B movie standards.By far the best this about this movie is Eva Mendes she looks sizzling, she brings much needed humour to the film and even though i hate to say it there love angle is by far the best part about this film, and did i mention THAT SHES MORE SIZZLING THAN THE ON FIRE GHOST RIDER.The soundtrack is disappointing too, and character development is minimum, the entire movie feels like an exercise to make the mandatory 3 sequels (atleast) that we have come to associate with Hollywood in recent times,THANK GOD THIS MOVIE HAS NO POTENTIAL FOR THE EVEN MORE TORTOROUS SPIN-OFFS (think Electra and cat-woman).What could have made a great B-movie is not only a bad/ordinary A-movie.The film-makers could have got the hint when the best power that GR gives the people a taste of their own sins,hardly exciting when by Christian standards MORE THAN HALF THE WORLD AND THE WHOLE OF America HAS A PLACE RESERVED IN HELL.Even though I've hardly written anything good about the movie pulls through on some good one liners, EVA MENDES, LOADS OF ORDINARY SCENES THAT JUST ABOUT HOLD YOUR ATTENTION AND Phenomenally LOW Expectations.Watch only if really really bored, if you like B-Movies and are willing to see this as one, and love Eva Mendes (shes wearing clothes fit for a nun though), free tickets for the premiere(in my case) or really cheap matinée show is a must.-s weak on all technical fronts including acting (suprisingly), no excitement whatsoever.+/-s would have made a good/great B-movie.+s EVA MENDES, good one liners and humour, lots of ordinary scenes that hold your attention.total 5/10 (facoring in expectations (lets not talk about PG-13) if you watch it like an A-list movie with Nicholas Cage then the rating will be much lower)",5,2,5,28 February 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Another entertaining sequel with lots of dazzle but no substance.
","One more sequel, one more trip to the theater knowing it wont even be as good as the last one, more lowering of expectations (this is no 3 remember),more writing about ordinary sequels (despite the lowered expectations), more hoping that this is not the end of the original action movie.This is the emergence of a disturbing trend in Hollywood movies, make sequel (or prequel) to a well established franchisee (comic or movie), pump it up with mind boggling special effects, satisfy a number of people from a wide range of audiences (harcore fans, special effect buffs, feminists, women, teens etc etc)and you have another movie that may not shatter any records or tempt critics but will guarantee that the studio coffers are filled.Also alarming is that there are hardly any new action movies coming out that are not based on comics, video games or even rides. One one side you feel that its great that a vast pool of potential is now being put to use, but on the other side its alarming that there is nobody that is able to deliver a completely new action movie to Hollywood.This movie follows the formula to the fullest.They have succeeded in getting most of the cast (ones that were most popular at least) from the earlier two movies and as expected they have delivered as much as possible on the acting front. In fact all the cast including the side cast has been good and that has helped this mediocre movie to come across as convincing.However it is clear that almost everyone has wanted a bigger more central role in this film and that means that we have an entire story revolving around a few X-men (way to much of Famke and Halle). Luckily this also means more of Sir Ian who is the only one who has played his role with the same panache as he played it in the original.There are hardly any new interesting mutants or characters added to this film and I'm sure that most hardcore fans will be disappointed with this film. The two characters with most potential were The Juggernaut and The beast who were I'm sure sacrificed to the contracts of the bigger stars.Way to much focus is put on Famke Jensons character which is completely bores you by the end of the film.This movie however raises more questions than it answers and has at least a dozen plot holes and I've not even read the comics.The most promising part of the film was the cure for mutancy but that was wasted and most of the focus was shifted to famkes character (who predictably can destroy the world hell we even have the hyper clichéd 'WHAT HAVE I DONE' god please spare me!!!!!).Again we have a movie that in the ending is about love, why the hell cant we have simpler motives that have spurned the greatest action movies such as survival, duty maybe even sacrifice.This film does have its memorable moments such as the moving of the bridge and my favourite scene with Juggernaut and Kitty. Also it is peppered with great one liners and a couple of good action sequences.Also the short length ensures that before you are about the start cribbing the movie is over.In all a so ordinary sequel that can be watched with highly lowered expectations, which is peppered with flashes of brilliance, mind boggling special effects and great one liners.+s great special effects, a couple of memorable scenes, great one liners, short length, good acting especially from Sir Ian.-s dozen plot holes, tooooooo much focus on some characters, not enough side plots or stories, boring, clichéd and humdrum ending, doesn't even meet lowered expectations.total 5/10 (in absolute terms more of 4)",5,4,5,16 June 2006
I Am Legend," Definitely not a legend...
","I'm not a big fan of Will Smith, but i know if anyone can carry a whole movie on his shoulders its him. That being said i had still had my doubts about this movie because i heard very contrasting reviews about this movie, and i wasn't sure of what to expect from this movie.As expected this movie is all about Will Smith, hes nothing less than superman, immune to the disease, built like tank, fit as hell, and a brilliant scientist to boot,not to mention hunts for his own food in the best cars.This movie basically has it all, loads of drama, special effects, action, a bunch of tense scenes, a decent story albeit very rehashed story, and one huge star, yet you get the feeling that lots is missing.No matter how big a star will smith is, seeing him and and his dog for hours at length is not exactly pleasurable.The drama would have been decent in small doses but here it gets overbearing, especially the scenes towards the end concerning god among others. Some of the dialogues seem straight out of a B-movie.The special effects are actually ordinary even pedestrian, scenes that come to mind are the lions and antelopes, and the often sub-standard rendering of the creatures and New York, im wondering how much will smith was paid that the film makers couldn't afford special effects that were at least 5 -7 years old.The cinematography was good,but the shoddy special effects made a big dent on them, the camera was the grainy type that is very popular nowadays, but you have to see movies like 28 days later, to see what what real desolation is about and how a post-apocalyptic future looks like.The tense were good, but far to predictable, the fact that there's one protagonist in the entire film had almost everything to do with, predictability was a major issue with this film right till the end.The story is as old as the mountains and there was nothing new here, each and every aspect of this movie has been suggested before either in films or in print, ORIGINALITY IF NOT SOMETHING THIS FILM SCORES ANY POINTS ON.The end to is very abrupt,fifteen minutes more would have been much appreciated, the end itself left a lot to be desired, some smart editing would have cut lots of the beginning and added more to the end, if there were issues with the length.Despite all this you cant take away that many points from this film mainly because- 1)Will Smith has done a fine job regardless of just being there too much.2)Many scenes although predictable do send your pulse racing.3)Some of the drama is actually quite endearing although again predictable.4)The action is decent and realistic, he may be like superman but he fights like a real person.5)The movie is short and sweet and although the end feels very abrupt you appreciate the small feature length.In all a decent movie thats far from being a legend for a variety of reasons.Watch with low expectations and you will come out satisfied, definitely doesn't have the blockbuster potential of say a transformers or Die Hard 4.0, please don't give into the Will Smith hype and the inflated ratings.-s ending, SPECIAL EFFECTS, ORIGINALITY, PREDICTABILITY.+/-s too much Will Smith??.+s lots of tense scenes, fine acting, decent cinematography, small length.Total 6/10 (met my confused but definitely lower expectations but didn't factor it in because of the already inflated ratings).",6,2,5,18 December 2007
Shrek the Third," Is the perfect 'Ordinary Sequel'....
","The 'year of the sequels' is on us and I go from sequel to sequel lots things are getting clearer to me, I'm finally coming to grasp with the 'all-prevalent and many yet to come' SEQUELS.Broadly speaking there a 4 kinds of sequels.1)Based on epics where the story is long with lots of characters and stories, these usually have the problem of too much content and are the easiest to handle. (ex star wars, lotr, matrix?).2)Based on legendary characters and their adventures, these are somewhat more difficult but can always work by changing the plot every time (ex Indiana Jones,die hard,rush hour, ANACONDA, load of B movies like TREMORS).3)comic book and video game sequels (self explanatory).4)Exploitation sequels these are the toughest to handle and are as difficult to understand as the title I've given them.Based on the concept of extracting the maximum from a one off concept the got much bigger than anticipated, the original succeeded on multiple factors (Story, character, plot, concept, big action scene etc) which makes making sequels difficult but still lucrative. (Ex SHREK, potc, SPEED,ice age, JURRASIC PARK (multitype but the 3rd and maybe 4th fit here).This being an exploitation sequel the movie is quite clear.1)ONly some characters were developed in the original so way to much extra billing has been given to people that were once only side jokes (the loads of fairytale people).2)The plot is razor thin and weak and the very base on which the first one was made (spoof of the fairy tales) is now lost.3)The jokes are getting stale (how many ugly ogre, farting and gingerbread jokes can you have?).4)They had enough content for 1 movie they pulled of a very good second one, that kind of confidence is not good.5)Demographics take the front seat, adults, teens, fans, children, blacks, whites, etc etc everyone has been taken into account.Still this movie has its plus points.1)The main characters are still hilarious and you have lots of funny moments especially from Donkey and Puss in boots who are the stars of the film.2)The fatherhood track is really really funny.3)Chilren really seemed to really enjoy this movie although the demographically pleasing content is clearly unsuitable for children.4)The movie is short and sweet and really funny in pieces, if a dozen teasers were made they would all be funny.IT HAS BEEN BROADLY ACCEPTED THAT I HAVE THE MENTAL AGE OF A 12 YR OLD AND ME NOT FINDING THE SPARK IN A MOVIE MADE FOR MY AGE GROUP IS A PROBLEM.The complete package is ordinary at best except if watched with children which pushes it up-to good or even very good.Watch only if your a fan OR in a very good mood and 'SEQUEL PREPARED'.Keep low expectations and you may just meet or exceed them.-s typical exploitation sequel, LACKS THE SPARK, many jokes are stale.+/-s puss in boots and donkey given major billing (i like them).+s funny in pieces (though not as good as a whole), SUPERB GRAPHICS, short and sweet, VERY GOOD FOR CHILDREN.total 5/10 ( just fell below expectations (after factoring in sequel), with children and correct company may even reach a 7).PS ANS TO MY QUESTION HOW MANY GINGERBREAD FARTING ETC JOKES CAN YOU HAVE? NOT ENOUGH APPARENTLY THE 4 TH SHREK IS ON ITS WAY.",5,16,26,15 June 2007
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Creates a never before combination of genres.
","How we perceive movies and indeed our ratings on them can be a result of many factors.But to tag this movie as.. Action. Adventure. Fantasy.Is indisputably the most misleading genre description of any movie I've ever seen. (to be fair I, like millions of others went in expecting the same).The Tags of this movie should read more like..Epic Romance. Drama. Tragedy.with sub genres of action, adventure, comedy.I a closeted Rom-com lover but AP2 has the kind of romantic background score, and dramatic pauses , which are not to be found even in chick Rom-Com's like Notting Hill.The romance is neither cute nor funny and is always laced with a hint of heaviness that everyone who's ever been in any doomed relationship will feel.And the drama, ooohhhhh the drama if the romance wont bring you to tears .... We have the fact that each and every character in this movie can be described as.... sad. borderline demented. disturbed. confused.suffering, or more likely a combination of the above.As for tragedy, those who know spider-man know what I'm talking about (but wait there's more), and for the others ...take my word there are multiple tragic elements to be found.Each and every character who has more than 5 minutes of screen place in this movie can be seen crying including the villains, bringing me to tears for watching this movie (not in a good way).Technically , there's a lot of hamming (and not in the cool way of the earlier batman movies), the special effects are to the high standards of todays blockbusters, and the background score and music is good for the genres that I believe this movie should fall under.A few may like the various directions in which comic-book movies are heading, but give me the less complicated fun of Thor, Iron Man and The Avengers any day.-s lots of hamming, misleading genres.+/-s drama, high promises from the sequel.+s stellar cast, great special effects (IMAX 3D hmmm), Emma Stone yummy.",4,3,8,14 May 2014
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Thats It????!!!!!!,
","This was my first reaction as the film ended and I'm sticking to it.BUT as I go from sequel to sequel,from Marvel movie to Marvel movie, and from OK movie to OK movie,so much 'MORE OF THE SAME' is making it very difficult to write a relatively coherent, unemotional, and objective review.Im no fan but I've do some research on the comic movie I'm about to see.Few things are clear about the movie though.1)ITS A HARDCORE FORMULA (accounting for demographics)FLICK. (read my review of spider-man 3to know what I'm talking about).2)The budget was limited.3)AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IF EVER THERE WAS A Children's FILM THIS IS IT.The formula part is clear because.1)The FF visit so many countries, its funny how the powerful general is always black and how so many scenes show Asian Army Men (haha in real life i wonder how many senior ranking generals are black and how many Asians are in the Army).2)The special effects are strictly OK, Mr. Fantastic looks absolutely fake, Invisible woman does no invisible stunts (ones requiring extra CG), The Thing is there only to talk, all the special effects have been spent on Super Doom, Silver Surfer and Human Torch (and his super version).3)This movie is more like the cartoons of FF, everyone knows that save for the Galactus angle (he devours worlds but is a vital part of the universe) there is nothing dark about the FF, in this sense this movie is ideal for children, no violence, only one person gets hurt and that too not visibly, the messages are all there making the right choices,doing your duty,accepting what you are etc etc.The burping and bear jokes are clearly aimed at them, the DANCING IN THE CLUB ALA SPIDERMAN MAY HAVE BEEN FOR MULTIPLE TARGETS (women,preteens,children) If you want to take children for a comic movie and are afraid about the sexual/violent/dark themes than this is the perfect movie.IF YOU VIEW THIS MOVIE AS A Children's COMIC BOOK MOVIE THAN THIS MOVIE IS CLEARY AN 8-9/10, the only thing that pull it down is that even cartoon have more action (especially gun action though they always do no harm) then this movie).Now for the justification of the summary..I expected Jessica Alba to be hot BUT SHE WAS LOOKING HIDEOUS TO SAY THE LEAST, the signs were there when she kept going on record to say she wanted to look less sexy so people could take her more seriously as an actress YA RIGHT, FF is just the vehicle to prove your acting prowess.I expected there to be at least one really big scene, but after almost every scene is was satisfied but craving for more. (The Millennium Wheel and the first chase scene were really good though).The Thing and Torch provide lots of funny G rated jokes, this movie is filled with G rated humour.Eye candy was non-existent the alternate track with the blonde 'ohh so perfect and nice' army woman was pathetic, the scene where she Johny pleads her to trust him when shes threatening them with a gun WAS FUNNY AND SAD AT THE SAME TIME (the gun may have as much as stung......................none of them), haha the FF and Silver Surfer threatened with a gun, minutes away from disaster have time for a dialogue scene.And the one fact that triggered the reaction, towards the end I expected a really big showdown between the most powerful character in the comic universe and his equally enigmatic but not quite as powerful servant, what i instead got was a damp squib that was stale enough to be ancient.SO THATS IT???!!! THATS HOW EASY IT IS TO DEFEAT THE MOST Powerful COMIC BOOK CHARACTER EVER.(The mega powerful SS wasn't beaten with much effort either).PROVISIONS FOR SEQUELS AND SPIN-OFFS HAVE BEEN MADE AS EXPECTED, I WILL SHAVE MY HEAD IF THERE Isn't At least ONE MORE FF AND A SILVER SURFER SPIN-OFF.On a positive note Laurence Fishburne did an excellent voice-over of the SS as did Macmohan with Doom.In all another film that just about meets the mark, BUT REALLY EXCELS AS A Children's MOVIE.Ideal for a matinée (any cheaper) show with the family on a Sunday (which is what i did).OR BETTER STILL WATCH ON TV WHEN IT COMES THERE.Watch with sequel considerations, ratings, comic book, current crop of movies in mind.-s NO BIG SCENES, every aspect leaves you with the feeling THATS IT?!!, so so acting, HIDEOUS ALBA, LACKLUSTRE END.+/-s Children's MOVIE.+s short and sweet, doesn't excel but manages to pull through on humour and a few memorable scenes dialogues,meets low expectations,VERY GOOD FAMILY/CHILRENS MOVIE.total 6/10 (factoring in lowered expectations and sequel, once again careful analysis makes the movie go from just good to OK to bad to worse, but when i left except the end leaving a really bad taste the movie was OK and I've stuck to my original rating, gone are the times repeat viewing and careful analysis made the movie better).",6,2,5,28 June 2007
Transformers," Almost a perfect blockbuster, highly flawed but still great FUN!!
","Great, Superb, Mindboggling, Have to see it, HOW COME YOU!! Haven't SEEN IT, these were the kind of responses I got from my friends when I asked them about this movie.I HAD TO scale up my expectations and expected nothing less than what they said about this movie.THANKFULLY a couple of hours before I met one of childhood friends, and he was one of the people with whom i have hours and hours of transformers, we were particularly fans of the movie and watched it numerous times, NOT Surprisingly HE SAID THE SAME THINGS ABOUT THIS MOVIE..............................BUT THEN ADDED SOME MORE.'Dont expect an epic battle between the robots, prepare to be confused as to who firing on whom and who dies, Megatron death isn't exactly epic either, AND THE CHICK IS SMOKING HOT', his words were a wakeup call for me, immediately my years of blockbuster experience kicked in and I had a new idea about what to expect from this movie.Expectations are the key in this movie and this was what i expected.1)Loads of cheesy dialogue, not all the pleasurable kind, but the kind that will instantly clog your arteries.2)Loads of plot holes, a few of the kind that will instantly hit you, and most that will realise when someone else tells you about it, or you ponder over the events of the movie.3)Total and complete demographic appeasement, America means the world, the mandatory black and jap soldiers, the courageous soldier who dies, the president,the chocolaty boy, the hot girl etc.4)The 2 hour plus length so as to fully incorporate the funny, romantic, action, drama etc etc scenes.5)The creative liberty with the original storyline, and this case since the transformers themselves were created to promote toys, loads of product placement.5)AND MOST OF ALL THE MIND BOGGLING SPECIAL EFFECTS.I was right on all counts save for some minor inconsistencies, it wasn't the president but the chief of something, the dialogues were not only super cheesy but some scenes like the capture of bumblebee was was brain hemorrhage, AND THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE NOT ONLY MIND BOGGLING THEY WERE DIZZYING, SINCE HARDLY A PENNY WAS SPENT ON THE ACTORS MOST OF THE 150 MILLION HAS GONE IN CREATING EFFECTS THAT WILL CERTAINLY LIFT THE Oscar, and so overwhelming were they in fact that for the entire duration of the movie you forget all else and are completely mesmerised.You could actually feel the impact(helps when your in a great theatre) and couldn't help but be blown away by loads of the scenes,the scorpion chase scene was actually scary.Megan Fox was not only smoking, she was one fire, i almost had a Heart attack when i saw her sliding onto Shias lap. BESIDES THE Occasional BUT periodic CHEESY SCENE SHE WAS THE ONLY THING THAT COULD DISTRACT YOU FROM THE SPECIAL EFFECTS.Technically this film was superb as indeed it should be, there is no doubt, that this movie has taken CGI to a new level.Humour was a major plus point and the diverse nature of the jokes were the other high point in the film.In all a highly flawed film, BUT ONE THAT EXCELS IN ONE DEPARTMENT SO MUCH that it makes this WHOLE MOVIE completely enjoyable throughout.Please watch this film BY PAYING PREMIUM RATES IN A GOOD THEATRE (said it after a long time), just do it with the right expectations, just don't expect Godfather type cinema.-s loads of SUPER CHEESY SCENES, tons of plot holes and flaws, unepical final battle (budget, demographics, and test audiences maybe?).+/-s typical blockbuster.+s SPECIAL EFFECTS, SPECIAL EFFECTS, MEGAN FOX, SPECIAL EFFECTS, MEGAN FOX, HUMOUR, MEGAN FOX, HUMOUR, HUMOUR, SPECIAL EFFECTS......total 8/10 (i had so much fun anything lower would have been a crime, at the same time there is no doubt this movie could have been much better, some of the cheesy scenes are still vivid in my memory, (must not ramble about the i see good in the humans scene and the human taking down a Decepticon when armies could not,Megatron came thousands of years ago to use earths machines in the fight on Cybertron hmmm i can see how bullock carts would take down Optimus Prime etc etc).",8,0,2,22 August 2007
From Dusk Till Dawn," Would have made a Great B-Movie!!!
","I am a proud lover of B-Movies or Lower A-movies. I love the quirky humour the old fashioned and lower quality special effects and the over exaggerated plot lines.I believe this movie is a cult classic and the only reason i can think off is that it is one of the cheesiest of movies these so called cult movie fans will ever see.It has all the makings of a classic B-Movie the quirky characters, the misplaced humour in the awkward situations, the humour in the fighting scenes etc etc.The movie does have the trademark styles of both Tarantino and Rodriguez though such as the Mexican setting and the untimely killings.The acting of the movie is top-notch and is probably the only thing that is not b-movie like as even the character artistes are not bad actors and often recognisable faces (check out the person in 3 different roles).Some of the characters especially the Sex-machine was hilarious.Also the music is good but then again its the best part of many b-movies.The pace of the movie moves along perfectly and its almost a shock (and a very pleasant one )even though you know that it has to happen when the fight with the vampires start.Which is where the worst and the best part of the movie is . I can see the humour, i can see the quirkiness but i can see why some parts especially the plot inconsistencies have to be so stupid.I've given this movie a low rating only because even though i enjoy b-movies i only watch them for free on TV and i paid good money on this one.If its coming on TV don't change the channel or better try getting the DVD(for free) from someone.",5,0,0,23 April 2006
The Dark Knight," The Dark Truth...
","Media Hype and Crowd Behaviour!!!! While lots of research has been done on this clearly its not enough, while there are lots of other points in this movie that merit study, it quite clearly this seemingly unrelated and external factors that determine the outcome of watching this movie.Well here are some dark truths, which after saying I expect the same vicious backlash that I would get after telling any other person something he doesn't want to hear.Truth No 1 - This is hardly a Batman film, as a person who grew up seeing the original TV series and cartoons and reading the original comics, and even the original movies, I can tell you that batman was always about humour even though i may not have been a fan of the almost comic TV series, even the comics had a sense of humour about them, besides as in any comic movie the comic is always about the man in the costume.What we have a here is multi-million modern urban social crime drama, with Batman only being used as the director to indulge in a socio-urban setting which a normal budget would not have allowed him, THE ACTION SCENES ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN.AND NO MATTER WHAT WHO SAYS WHAT THE F@#K HAPPENED TO THE NEO-Gothic LOOK OF GOTHAM DOWN TO THE OLD FASHIONED CARS AND PINSTRIPED SUITED CRIMINALS THAT WE HAVE ENJOYED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF BATMAN IN ALL MEDIUMS AND ACROSS ALL TIMES.Truth no 2 - This is not a movie to be watched by children even in they are accompanied by their parents, I've SPOKEN TO THE CHILDREN WHO I PLAY WITH IN THE PARK (i claim my mental age is 12 and i love children), AND EACH AND EVERYONE HATED IT, there was a time where comics were meant for children and teens,and if nothing else was at least fun for all age groups, but now its the medium for artistically inclined serious adults who want to see REAL PEOPLE WITH SUPERHUMAN POWERS.Oh please give me the superfantastical superhero of yore anyday.Truth no 3 - He may be dead but that does not mean that this is the best performance by any actor ever AND HELL EVEN IN IT IS A SINGLE STUPENDOUS PERFORMANCE Doesn't MAKE A MOVIE THE BEST MOVIE EVER at least have the common sense to the final result as the sum of all its factors.Just because the critics and the publicity managers tell you that it was the final greatest performance by a person who was disturbed enough to commit suicide doesn't mean we exhibit herd mentality and all go with the flow.It was a great performance NOT THE GREATEST EVER.truth no 4 - This movie had 2 climaxes, there were people in the theater who were ready to leave after a certain scene in the movie because they didn't know there was another character that was yet to be introduced, this movie was very very long, and that scene i waited for the movie to get over. In fact IT WAS THE LONG WAIT AFTER WHAT I THOUGHT WAS AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF THE MOVIE THAT RUINED MOST OF THE MOVIE FOR ME.truth no 5......................well what the hell i can go on rambling but im going to be judged anyway so im going to end here.Some truths that everyone will like.The performances from everyone were great.The background score was very good but it always sounded like the movie was climaxing instead of just moving forward.WHATEVER THE FACTS MAY BE THE END RESULT FOR ME WAS A GOOD MOVIE THAT WAS MADE LESS GOOD BY THE unnecessary hype and the coinciding herd mentality.Maybe this movie was less suited to my tastes, but at least i deserve to told what im getting into, im hoping this is like ang lees hulk that was loved by critics and their followers initially but later people realised that may be they didn't like this movie that much after all, BUT THEN AGAIN NOBODY DIED WHILE MAKING THAT MOVIE....-s WHY SO SERIOUS?? not like the batman i expected, very long, over-hyped.+/-s not a movie for all audiences....+s superb performances all around, good soundtrack, some memorable scenes.total 6/10 (THE PERFORMANCE (you know whose im talking about), was indeed very good but the overall product fell well below my expectations if i wanted to watch a crime drama (which i don't like much anyway since i get majorly put of by crime) i would re-watch godfather or any other such movie.GIVE THE BATMAN OF YORE ANYDAY (exlude batman and robin).ps i expect to be judged and ridiculed, so bring it on, i have my own opinions which im proud to say are based on my own tastes and not by those of drama-tragedy loving critics and crowds driven to a frenzy by media hype.",6,6,13,13 August 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Entertaintment - Definitely, Fun -No Way, Children Friendly - I Don't think so!!
","There was a time when movies that were supposedly targeted at children were simple and fun.Bad guys were bad and they lost, good guys were good and they won, good guys who turned bad suffered and bad guys who turned good were rewarded.The music was fun and cheerful and blood shed was unheard of,SCARY ELEMENTS WERE KEPT AT A MINIMUM.Movies were fun to watch, with loads of kiddy jokes, and special effects aimed at children.Underaged kissing was at a minimum old people kissed but it was short, and after loads of cute scenes the maximum a child got was a peck on the cheeks or a brush on the lips which sent guffaws among the audience and left the boy blushing.Times have changed now.The good guys have dark streaks and its not clear as to who's good and who's bad, BAD GUYS WIN AND GOOD GUYS LOSE.Music is eerie and rarely fun, children are shown bleeding under heinous torture, SCENES BORDERING ON HORROR ARE SHOWN.Fun is unheard of, no QUIDITCH MATCHES, OR MAGICAL FUN CREATURES HERE (even a giant was shown in a unhumorous fashion),don't remember more than one scene that was specifically aimed at children, or would entertain them (even the OWL disruption scene was more importantly a rebellion against the system).Kisses between two 15 year olds is long, passionate, and definitely not fun, even the discussion afterwords in not cute, the boy is not blushing, the girl is crying during the kiss, I've seen first kisses in adult movies that are less intense.I CAN GO ON AND ON AND ON ABOUT LOTS OF THINGS THAT MAKE THIS MOVIE ANYTHING BUT FUN OR A CHILDREN MOVIE.BUT THE FACT IS HARRY POTTER CEASED TO BE A CHILDREN BOOK FROM THE 5TH BOOK.And its high time people realised this, the moment you start seeing this as teen/adult entertainment you will have completely different perspective of this movie/the books.I FOR ONE WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO WATCH THIS MOVIE WITH THIS IN MIND AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THIS MOVIE WAS ENTERTAINING.Special effects were superb, but the ministry of magic could have been more magical, TECHINCALLY THIS FILM WAS SUPERB WITH Brilliant CAMERA WORK AND SUCCEEDED IN MAINTAINING A DARK ATMOSPHERE THROUGHOUT (yes dark).Acting was again superb hats of to Imelda Staunton who did a superb job as Dolores, I've never felt such loathing (and some fear), for any screen character in a long time.The few jokes that were there and mainly involving Filch were fun.The action scenes fell short and really a full scale fight between the Order and the Death Eaters that too at the ministry of magic had much more potential.The entry scene between Dumbledore and Voldermort was fantastic and filled me with hope in this otherwise dark movie.The entertainment value of this movie is unquestionable, it even met the somewhat lower expectations i had from it.HOWEVER ITS STATUS AS A FUN FILM AND ESPECIALLY A Children's FILM IS SERIOUSLY IN DOUBT.But still there are people who think Lord of the rings was meant for children (AS I SAY THIS, EXCEPT THE KISSING MOST Indian CHILDREN ARE REGULARLY EXPOSED TO Violence AND OTHER DARK ELEMENTS IN MOVIES HERE AS WELL AS OUR EPICS SO WE Don't REALLY CARE, the fun part is more important for us, we go in the movie expecting fun and don't really get any).Watch with correct expectations and you wont be disappointed (infact be entertained).-s NO FUN, lots of plot holes, feels kind-off rushed, lots of things/characters/scenes/sub-plots feel like they didn't get the attention they deserved.+/-s content vs length (you choose), only the most important parts were shown,misleading as a children's film.+s superb acting, superb technically, quite good as part in an ongoing epic, definitely entertaining with lots of hate, scary, hopeful, and visually spectacular moments.total 6/10 (i expected good and got it, i expected fun and received almost none, it however exceeded expectations in other departments, it extracted emotions from me that were hardly expected in a so called children's film, ONCE AGAIN ITS ALL ABOUT THE HYPE AND ONCE AGAIN YOU GIVE IN BECAUSE At least THE MOVIE Isn't BAD, HOW I PRAY FOR A HYPE FILM THAT ACTUALLY JUSTIFIES IT (die hard is very close and I'm hoping so will transformers).",6,0,0,19 July 2007
Blood Diamond," TIA - This Is Africa
","I really wanted to see this movie but was scared by the drama element ever since I've seen Titanic Leonardo Di-Caprio has left a scar on me, the wound has since healed and Leo has matured on to become one of the finest actors in Hollywood but I'm still scared I'm going to walk into a much hyped movie and come out suffering from 3.5 hours of exposure to drama and romance.Yet I did see the movie the weekend it released in India and was happy I did.'This is Africa' as the actors of the film often repeat is the in fact the central theme of the movie.The movie explores the ground situation in most war torn countries of Africa and shows us some very interesting and thought inducing facts.1)That natural resources have indeed on bought about death and destruction to Africa (true from historic times) this is summed up brilliantly by the dialogue in the movie 'Thank good they didn't find oil' (something middle east will vouch for).2)That indigenous people in Africa are in fact as responsible for the problems in Africa as the foreigners and instead of organising themselves into helping each other they allow themselves to be manipulated into helplessness, the spate of the people in Africa can again be summed up brilliantly by the dialogue '....then you'll just be another black man in Africa'.3)That there is hope and even though they are war torn and death and destruction is part of their everyday lives the people who dare to dream in Africa and and there are others who want to make a difference.4)The child soldiers (not only in Africa) are the most frightening part of any war torn country children and fragile and when they cross the line they don't just walk but run. Child Soldiers are known to be most brutal of any soldiers and the most heinous war crimes like rape, dismemberment and even cannibalism are mostly carried out by them. Tackling this is going to be the biggest problem, that those trying to restructure such countries face.5)And my favourite part is how the movie has explored the mixed feelings that the local white people of Africa feel. They are the most interesting part of the movie. Wanting to leave and at the same time struggling with the love for the land they were born and brought up in, are just some of the problems they face, confused about loyalties, racism and to boot it all the funny accents (Leo did a brilliant job here, he sounded just like some of the South African and Zimbabwean cricketers ).The part about blood diamonds should have been only the the foundation on which the movie was built but was in fact given undue credit in the movie, sensationalists and I believe untrue figures were used to make it look like conflict diamonds were the only cause of Africas Problems and extra-brownie points were earned by putting the onus on the American People (sometimes the I think the Americans like to see themselves as the centre of the world and responsible for everything even death and destruction).The movie also seems out of date considering that Sierra Leone and many other Diamond Rich African States are now Conflict Free and the hordes of diamonds that had been stored can now be freely sold, yet peace has hardly bought any progress Sierra Leone has the highest infant mortality rate in the world and average lifespan is 38 years.Yet the movie has put a lot of focus and Africa and Africans and for that it gets huge credit.Techinically this movie is as good as any movie with this sort of budget and cast should be.Acting was nearly flawless every actor doing his job perfectly, yet Leo shown above the lot.The direction and cinematography was superb helped by Africas Natural Beauty.Background sounds, languages and accents showed superb research and were used effectively.And once again special effects were top notch.A flaw in the movie is its failure to show the double standards and opposing faces of the life and relief work in Africa, billions are being spent and while many (including relief workers) spend life luxuriously other grovel in poverty.The only other flaw the movie has (besides its diamond centric viewpoint )is the ending IT WAS WAY TO PREDICTABLE AND QUITE HYPOCRITICAL, there are enough clues in the movie that you are absolutely sure of the ending and it robs its effectiveness. Also the manner in which movie ends clearly shows double standards.I hate dramas but the brutal life like action and the interesting viewpoints ensure that you are always connected to the movie and the same time you are entertained and excited an extremely rare combination for movies that try to posses any measure of social commentary.A movie that can be watched and enjoyed by all, even by action/comedy only watcher like me.THIS MOVIE IS A MUST WATCH.-s slightly uni-dimensional portrayals and viewpoints, VERY PREDICTABLE ENDING.+/s romance ???? too universal to be a classic??.+s technically flawless in all aspects of films, Leonardo Di Caprio, great Africa Centric viewpoint which includes white Africans.total 8/10 (actually if you factor in expectations and universal appeal it actually a nine but my close friend is one the biggest cutters of diamonds (has never bought uncertified rough) and he assures me that the diamond issue is blown out of proportion (way to shift blame away from arms dealers and relief agencies? )and I trust him enough to give the movie a slightly lower rating)",8,1,2,15 January 2007
Saw," Gut wrenching short and sweet but a few plot holes.
","Well i had heard a lot about this movie and i finally ended up seeing it. I must say that i expected the world from the movie and even then it met my expectations.The editing and storytelling is cutting edge the action starts right from the beginning and grips your attention throughout the film.The acting in the movie is top notch and I'm happy to see Cary Elwes an actor whom i have liked from the time i saw him in' Robin hood men in tights' have such a significant role i really feel he is a talented actor and he should be in many more movies. Other than that the acting of Liegh Wankel was also worth a mention as both of them were the main characters and carried of their roles brilliantly. The rest of the cast were great in whatever roles they had to play.I however seem to have a problem with this movie being slotted as a horror because somehow i didn't quite see it as one maybe i am from the old school where horror always implies some otherworldly elements.The only problem with the movies are the plot and character holes some of them are:- 1)The detectives who are obviously trained to think on their feet and are probable well versed with detaining criminals behaved in a matter most inappropriate to their training, even a normal person would have behaved in a manner that would have much better outcome then what we saw when trained professionals confronted a known possibly armed murderer.The circumstances had to be different and more difficult for the outcome to be the one we saw.2) The ending though thrilling seems unbelievable in otherwise a believable movie.3)Also the intelligence and resourcefulness shown by the protagonists throughout the film was absent and could have easily have prevented what was another memorable scene. Again the circumstance could have been different for what had happened to happen.(however these things though annoying were important in the movie and don't harm the movie much) Save for this everything about this movie was brilliant and although i am not a great fan of the brushed up versions of such films i thoroughly enjoyed the R rated version.A movie that can be enjoyed by almost anyone, its not one of those high brow , arty festival premium release movie that it has been wrongly positioned as.Do watch this film.",8,0,1,7 April 2006
The Descent," As good as they say it is.....
","I was looking for a good action film when I came across Dog Soldiers quite obviously I didn't find it, but I looked for other movies by Neil Marshall and came across 'The descent', I immediately remembered the movie as being similar to 'the Cave' and being released close each other.What occurred to me is that both have obviously been inspired, by 'The Descent' a popular novel by Jeff Long, but the difference(Hehe) ends there, while Cave is one of the better PG-13 (the bane of movies) rated movies which is quite clearly inspired by the novel, a movie with that rating can only get this good, 'The Descent movie' even though it shares the same name as the novel is quite different from both, if you've seen 'The Cave' or read the novel then in fact the movie will have your mind ticking even more.I've seen hundreds of movies and thanks to a traumatic experience in my childhood when I saw The Omen, and was mind-fu##ed for 2 weeks (boohoo), I've lost all fear of horror movies and rarely and I mean rarely get surprised by the timing or nature of the 'Shock Scenes' and even by THOSE SHOCKS THAT NEVER CAME, but hell there were all of 4 scenes that left me completely shocked and thats more than I've been in a few years, one particular scene had me chilled to bone (and freaked my mom, a horror movie fan even more, when she watched it separately),trust me when I say THIS MOVIE HAS BOUGHT A FRESH BREATH TO THE ACTION-HORROR-THRILLER GENRE NOT SEEN IN DECADES.The movie is a pioneer of sorts in the action-horror-thriller genre some examples are:- 1) No guns.2) All women cast.3)No black people who get killed first haha kidding (not that I care but luckily the film-maker realises others don't either you cast according to your vision not to be demographically correct).4)Lots of unanswered questions, in fact a dramatic standoff that I expected never came, everyone will have many different viewpoints to at least 3 or 4 major events in the movie.5)The heroine is not a perfect, moral, indestructible, lucky person but in fact vulnerable and I BELIEVE displayed a major lack of judgment in a particular scene.6)A creature that's probably as vulnerable as the people.7)Fantastic depiction of the mental condition of the characters that changes throughout the movie.and many more.....For a B-movie the production values were fantastic including the sound effects, cinematography and direction, the script was extremely well written with absolutely no corny dialogues or scenes.One of the only complaints was that the claustrophobic confines of the caves was never really effectively captured and even though the tension always remained the feeling of claustrophobia never really hits you SAVE FOR ONE BRILLIANT SCENE, if this was done then this would have been as near a perfect film of this genre as possible, Maybe some more POV (point of view) shooting was required (the caving videos on TV have me squirming).The acting of this movie was top notch with a brilliant and subdued performance from the entire cast, none of the histrionics that you would expect from an all women cast. The number of QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED AND ANSWERED JUST BY MERE LOOKS speaks volumes of the quality of acting.The movie has too many brilliant sequences to name but the end and the opening sequence are worth mentioning.This movie may not be as scary as other films due to many points but has its fair share of horror and shock moments, besides other great points, it is after all a multi-genre film.(Not a good judge of fear but i feel a movies only truly scary when the movies based in real life situations, because I'm definitely never going into unexplored caves so its difficult to identify with).Besides the one flaw this movie has some minor plot holes and inconsistencies of which only one is alarming but cannot be mentioned without spoilers, these too marginally help in removing this movie from the near perfect ratings.In all we have a near perfect ACTION-HORROR-thriller movie that a breath of fresh air, and has brilliant acting and superb production values even when compared to the better budget films.A must watch if your fan of the genre in particular or horror/action/thriller movies in general.-s some plot holes and inconsistencies, claustrophobia doesn't hit.+/-s the error in judgment (I'm fine with it though). +s brilliant acting, superb production values, large number of brilliant scenes, breath of fresh air, a true multigenre film.total 9/10 (if you factor in the budget, and the fact that it exceeded expectations, and that such efforts from British filmmakers need encouragement then this movie is a ten but will take a call on that after many years and some repeat viewings)",9,2,6,30 January 2007
The Da Vinci Code," An mildly entertaining (and ordinary) film with high curiosity value !!!!
","Well lets be frank I only read the book because of the controversy surrounding it, and only saw the movie because of the curiosity factor and frankly expected no real excitement from this movie.And I got exactly what I expected.Even though the book was highly flawed and probably had one of the worst endings in bestseller history it was far superior to the movie (as is the case most of the times).The main flaws of this movie is the casting of Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon he looked completely out of place in the role (plus I hate to admit it but even I agree with the people when the felt his hairstyle was hideous).Maybe Reno is not complaining but it saddens me that a actor of his talent is wasted in any movie that has anything to do with France or the french.Sir Ian was clearly the star of this movie and played the role of the staunch British scholar to the hilt. His one liners also brought the much needed humour into this movie.However the scene when the three protagonists sit in Sir Ian's mansion and discuss the evidence about the grail which was clearly the most important part of the movie could have been much better. The evidence provided in the book was far more conclusive and here it only looked like a well publicised conspiracy theory which can be summed up in the movies dialogue only (The Eyes See Only What They Want To See). This scene could have also been used to help a lot of the other questions in the movie (such as why did the bank manager attack the duo?).This movie could have done with at least one more reveal all, or explanatory scene summing up the movies events.The technically the movie was as good as any but I felt it could have done with some good background score or a theme or something.The movie offered no excitement a person who has read the book and I'm sure hardly any for one who has not.Most People who have read the book will not enjoy this movie and those that have not will not understand this movie.A strictly OK movie which is entertaining and more than anything satisfies your curiosity without leaving you bored (cant say the same about some of the remakes and sequels which have been watched out of curiosity).Don't expect too much and you wont be disappointed.",6,0,1,6 June 2006
Love Actually," Great on feel good factor!! Not really that funny though!! ( i deny everything)
",Lets be frank i don't like watching romance movies. The only ones i do watch are romantic comedies (that i watch when I'm alone and deny seeing later).So i only agreed to watch this movie because i was told it was really funny......I deny saying any of these things The movie even though was not really that funny was really good. Its utterly predictable ( i warn you i get it right 9.5 times out of ten) and a lot of the fun comes from being right with maybe some changes.The movie is loaded with feel good factor and i mean loaded. Being Indian i may not feel the Christmas spirit i can easily factor in.... say how someone will be feeling in diwali and then watch the film. And all those things spread with the occasional laugh and constant smile make the film great to watch.The only thing going against the movie is that it is not as funny as the best movies out there.

","I saw the trailer of the film and i saw potential the only thing left to determine was the rating, there was no way you could pull off a good horror-vampire movie without blood/bleeding when I saw the confidence inspiring 'R', and 'Sam Raimi' as the producer I knew i wouldn't be disappointed.The opening sequence of the movie was artistic but completely confusing and unnecessary, but after that the movie goes on a steep uphill curve.Almost all the aspects of the movie are self explanatory, the mass migration, the reason the town exists, what who is thinking, etc etc.Almost no time is wasted in unnecessary and long drawn conversations as too the why how, and that really helps with the feature length, KEEPING A MOVIE WITH A VERY LIMITED PLOT LIKE THIS INTERESTING FOR THE WHOLE RUN-TIME IS NOT A EASY JOB BUT THE FILM MAKERS HAVE DONE IT WITH ELAAN.However i was not convinced about the flow of the days, the passage of time was very ineffectively captured at best, not only that, the way it was shown will lead to at least 20 improbabilities and impossibilities, this was one area where the film really lost out on.Character development wasn't much but it was never missed, just the right amount of focus was laid on development, and luckily FLASHBACKS A STAPLE OF MOVIES WHERE EVERYONE KNOWS EACH OTHER NEVER REARED ITS HEAD.The movie builds the tension and almost never really lets up, the movie lacked in numbers(there were a few good ones),the big tension or horror scenes (the ones where everyone laughs afterwards), but it made up easily on the tension that was maintained throughout.The action was good but this wasn't that much of an action movie, explosions, guns and obviously hand to hand combat are at a minimum and only used as means to move the story forward.THIS MOVIE IS MUCH MORE OF A HORROR THRILLER AND A WELCOME CHANGE FROM THE MORE ACTION ORIENTED VAMPIRE MOVIES OF LATE (which i am actually quite fond of).Acting was very good all around, melodrama was at a minimum except towards the end, especially good were Manu as deputy sheriff and The stranger.SURPRISINGLY ALMOST NO HUMOUR IN THIS ONE.Technically merely good/OK because the perpetual dark doesn't get to you, even movies like Pitch Black did a better job, fear of the dark is almost a universal human trait and it could have definitely been exploited.The other weak part was the end, it didn't really follow the tone of the movie, it was a typical FILMY (as we say in India) ending almost taking chick flick proportions its almost amazing this movie holds it own after such a weak ending.Censorship once again affected my viewing experience with a bunch of dialogues being lost thanks to the shoddy editing, in a bid to cut scenes of what the censors consider inappropriate.In all a great weekend night movie, can be enjoyed by anyone although it doesn't have enough action for a hardcore action fan.-s very poor flow of days, VERY WEAK ENDING, technically OK.+/-s explanations??? some people like/want them.+s very good acting, interesting plot, tense throughout, a few very tense moments, one liners.total 7.5/10 (im sure this movie will be better without censorship and I've added a half point for that, it did go above my expectations but i didn't factor that in because that would push the rating to high, the end was just to weak to merit a higher rating, and its a wonder a movie can get such good ratings with such a weak end ).",7,2,4,23 December 2007
Wedding Crashers," Great movie but like almost all movies recently it loses out in the ending!!!
","I went to the movie with a lot of expectations (i expected a great beginning and middle) and some apprehensions ( i expected a chick flick end) and its very weird that the movie exceeded my expectations in the beginning and was worst than i expected in the end.The movie has some great gags, though most are crude and in your face and some are subtle.people who like Vince Vaughan will love him here. the two lead actors to share a great chemistry.i felt the lead actress could have been prettier considering it was love at first site for a experienced player.the only part where the movie slips is in the ending which wasn't even a like an ending in a chick flick it was dry and boring and made absolutely no sense in the film even in you consider the fact that its movie with quite a few crude jokes. after being surprised at a film that exceeded my expectation in the beginning i was quite disappointed that the ending was worse than i thought.other than the ending its a great film that must be watched one time.",7,1,5,15 January 2006
The Wolf of Wall Street," Excellence in only one aspect of a film ....when do you stop caring..
",i have never been more confident about the title of a review capturing my thoughts about a movie so completely.This movie has brilliant performances ...the excesses shown as part of the lives of the protagonist and his associates (most of which i have learned are true)...have been shown with a blend of extremism and restraint which will guarantee nominations in all the awards..The issues begin early on starting with the plot.....because the story revolves around characters who barely change throughout the movie....and around a series of events in their lives .....the movie becomes utterly predictable and boring towards the end....The editing is leisurely as if a deliberate attempt at an epic is play.The cast is able to pull of individual scenes with aplomb but the weak plot and poor editing ....which has stretched the movie to the EPIC length of 180 minutes doesn't do this movie an favours..We all know from the beginning how this is going to end...but after a while the sense of foreboding reaches the point where you almost know how every scene or incident is going to end.This movie is possibly a victim of its Cast and crews greatness...and their misdirected shot at making another legend..If the end despite the amazing talent behind and in front of the camera this movie remains a bunch of amazing scenes..,6,3,7,11 January 2014
Shooter," Return to the 80's style action movie...
","I've been off new movies for a while now thanks to the sheer amount of emotional content even in relatively simple actions movies of late, even Casino Royale felt more like a romantic movie than an action one.The fact my friends and I decided very late that we wanted to see a movie and this was the last show of the day.I expected another love on the run kind of movie going by the adds, considering the fact that fugitives on the run always fall in love in the last decade or so.BUT BOY WAS A I Surprised.....Action Movies in classic period 70-80s weren't about love, like the movies of today, they were about simpler and stronger themes like hate, anger, revenge, saving the world,survival or sometimes even none of the above. They were action flicks pure and simple and made with the boys in mind, with good special effects, lots of blood and gore, and the scantily clad women who weren't always the love interest. Those were the years, you had the occasional emotional action flick but those were appreciated as there were not many of them. (PS as i say this I must say I'm only 24 and watch movies on DVD's now and Video before that I've grown up loving boy movies like predator, aliens, Rambo etc.).This movie is the simplest big budget action film I have seen in years, which is like the 70s and 80's action flicks.This movie isn't about love, its about feelings that are often much more stronger, PATRIOTISM, HATE, REVENGE.(The best part is that the intimate moments don't culminate in a kiss,an event that was hardly seen action films of yesteryear's but is seen in more big budget action films nowadays then in romantic comedies, for this alone this movie deserved 8 stars).We have the older themes like the one-man army who's out for revenge and at the same time wants to clean the system.The hero isn't a emotional boy-toy hes a super-killer like Rambo, Dirty Harry, Arnold etc.The girls are not there providing emotional support to the men, but like the classics take the back-seat to make way for the action. (And the gratifying but unnecessary exposure is also provided, sadly none from Rhonda Mitra though).The movie is made in the superlative and no attempts are made to relate it to real (unlike the action movies that have the most outrageous action sequences but make the man a homo/metro whatever its called nowadays just to make it more real, think of that when a car flips over 5 times, or when face masks are printed in 5 mins).Attempts made to errors in the law of science and logic will turn up dozens of examples but I don't care and neither did the mostly male audience.The attacks at the system are not overdrawn conversations but simple, hard-hitting facts, you may not be emotionally drained but amidst all the mindless fun, you get thinking.The acting is good even though its hardly important, yet the parts played by all the characters are good (considering the fact that the film is in the superlative).Technically this film is very good as any big budget film should be, with lots of real explosions and stunts and minimum use to CGI.The one-liners are few but they are very very good.Considering the genre of the film the only real flaws the film has is that when you see a film made in the superlative based in the real world sooner or later your mind starts churning and you begin to reject material( Did he just do that, how can that happen, no way not again .......etc etc etc), the longer than normal length gives you just about time to start thinking about this before the movie ends.The lack of stylised action scenes, especially since the movies all about guns, we needed some defining action moments but this film doesn't really have any.In all a great action film thats simple and mindless fun, and a must watch for fans of the simple no-nonsense action movie.A must watch for the guys although some of the girls seemed to like it too.-s no defining moments or stylised gun action scenes, the superlatives finally get to you maybe due to the slightly above normal length.+/-s none really this movie is plain and simple.+s pure and simple mindless fun, lots of guns, blood and gore and explosions, good acting (considering the points), good chicks,revenge flick about a guy who cleans the system (got me goosebumps),no kisses NOT ABOUT LOVE (THANK GOD FOR THAT).Total 8/10 (not counting the fact that it exceeded expectations and the fact that its a simple fun action flick don't compare it to dramas and then cry about it).",8,2,8,26 April 2007
Iron Man," Better than Expected.......thanks to Great Acting??!!
","Lets face it, when you go to watch a comic book adaption the last thing you expect is a cinematic masterpiece, at best you will get a FORMULA FLICK THAT ENTERTAINS and at worse FORMULA FLICK THAT Doesn't ENTERTAIN.But even more recently you had a different kind of comic book adaption, the fun is out, THE DRAMA IS IN, ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY INCLUDING THE FANS BUT MOST EFFORT WAS PAID TO THE CRITIC WHO ITS WELL KNOWN CAN NEVER GET ENOUGH OF DRAMA AND EMOTION...Offlate most of the comic book movies fall into this category,AND TAKE THEMSELVES TO SERIOUSLY....They pump their movies full with good actors..Put in lots of emotional scenes.....bloody everyone cries (think spidey3)....Themes of love are rampant throughout the film...superman had more problems than charlie brown...On face value this movie looks like it will fall in this category, I mean who wouldn't, one look at the starcast and you will remember HULK and be scared.But somehow this movie was different, this movie didn't have the special effects that will leave you flabbergasted or the unnecessary comic relief YET IT WAS FUN.AND SHOCKINGLY IT WAS DUE TO THE SUPERB ACTING, Robert Downey played the middle aged teen who became a superhero brilliantly, he was funny suave and a delight to watch.Jeff Bridges looked and played the part of an evil corporate honcho to the hilt.Even Gwyneth Paltrow did great job of playing the not so serious pepperpot.Thanks to the acting even the subtle romance scenes were enjoyable to a romance allergic person like me.The action scenes AND SPCIAL EFFECTS etc were in fact weak compared to TRANSFORMERS WHICH HAS OBVIOUSLY SET THE BENCHMARK FOR SCI-FI ACTION.However the fact remains that this movie remains weak in primary selling points, THE HERO IS WEAK BECAUSE FOR THE MOST PART THERE IS NO Villain AND ANY GOOD HERO NEEDS At least AN AS EVIL Villain.Special effects were only at par.The comic book excitement was lacking.SINCE IRON MAN HAS ALMOST NO GLOBAL FAN FOLLOWING ESPECIALLY HERE IN India, we definitely needed some aura building which was lacking (especially in film).Yet this movie delivers the goods and can be watched even in after paying premium rates, although watching a nice matinée show would definitely push the experience up.-s no recognition, at par special effect,so so action, no comic book feel.+\-s none quite a simple film actually.+s GREAT ACTING, ALL DRAMA AND ROMANTIC SCENES HANDLED BRILLIANTLY, even things like humour are withing the main characters.total 7/10 (not factoring in the fact that this movie was above my actually quite low expectations, expect good and you will get it, if you are one of those drama loving maniacs, BE AWARE THE ACTING IS SUPERB BY COMIC BOOK MOVIE STANDARDS BUT NOT BY THE 3 HR LONG EPIC DRAMA STANDARDS.)",7,1,2,8 May 2008
Casino Royale," The Old Bond is Dead.....
","Im a huge fan and despite the delayed review I did see it in the first weekend of it's release. The critics loved this bond, and that scared me the most, bond was never about the critics, in a politically correct world he was a dash of imperialism, watching a bond movie was like eating a double-decker sandwich with everything in a gourmet restaurant the ingredients were the same but the expensive surrounding made the taste so much better.Im pro-change, everything changes and with the changing times everything needs to change, the old bond was from the royal family and was cold-war era relic, with the fall of the Soviet Union, the movies were at loss for new villains and frankly none of the modern villains or their motives (save for golden-eye with the defected 00) had the flavour that SPECTRE and its associates brought to the movies, now we have a villain albeit a faceless, stateless one TERRORISTS AND TERRORISM, Osama is not marketable enough so the bond makers have done the next smartest thing and MADE PASSING References TO THE ORGANISATION (SPECTRE REINVENTED AND IM WILLING TO BET MY LIFE ON IT), thus bringing us back to the faceless all powerful organisation that shone in bond movies till the 70's, the world was a bigger place back then,the new spectre with its terrorist links (whats the bet, they will take the chicken route and not discuss their religion) will have global universal HATE APPEAL not enjoyed by Spectre (I'm from India we liked the soviets).But this movie has gone and removed almost everything that was good about bond, he was royal blood, charming, confident, racist, chauvinist while this one is everything but the above he hardly even feels British.The lingering feeling is that this movie IS In fact PREQUEL FOR THE FORTHCOMING MOVIES where bond will find his groove and settle in it, the closing lines, the references to 'the organisation' give us hints that the old bond will be back in a new avatar and this movie wants to give a Freudian analysis on why he becomes the way he his, I'm not a big fa of this move.This is however closer to IAN FLEMINGS EARLIER NOVELS THEN ANY OTHER BOND MOVIE, I've read some novels and the earlier one did in fact have the dry, cold humour and brutal action scenes like this one.The movie is entertaining though we have loads of superb one-liners but they get overbearing after sometime, i don't see many of them becoming bond movie legends the way even Pierce Brosnans one-liners have become.The production values are absolutely superb with excellent use of black and white in the opening scenes, the soundtrack is OK though and the old formula of the big bond song also dies with this movie.The acting is superb all around, too much has been said about Craig I for one would not rate him as highly as the others, his acting great though.There are a couple of memorable scenes such as the opening scene and the chase scene.The movie is also quite long and get boring sometimes, those who don't enjoy poker will not enjoy this movie as much, the emotions one experiences while playing hold-em have to played to be understood.The filmmakers almost purposefully try and be different, the fabulous Aston Martin is wasted, they almost purposefully have no explosions in this movie at the end which actually makes the climax quite OK.This movie has been made with the women and the critics in mind, no guys (the traditional audience) likes to see nude men, and so much emotion and drama in this bond film.The twists are predictable and expected and add little to the movie.When I went to a bond movie i didn't want a character rooted in reality, i wanted a super-spy, hot chicks, great care chases, guns, explosions, supervillians, Q, chauvinism and still be called cool, like I said it was like double-decker sandwich with everything (especially extra cheese), seeing all this in a big budget (expensive) setting made it so much cooler, removing most of the ingredients and substituting others with low fat variety, will always make it less tasty.In all we have bond movie thats more of a prequel and which has deviated from almost every bond characteristic to date, participation of critics and newer audience will ensure higher ratings but people with more simple tastes like me (i enjoyed American pie) prefer the old bond any day.Watch the movie after due consideration.-s changed almost all bond characteristics, long and boring in parts, the effort to be different show, so-so background score.+/-s Daniel Craig, maybe a prequel, the movie pimps everything bond drives a ford for gods sake.+s superb acting and production, a couple of memorable scenes, SHOWS SOME GREAT PROMISE FOR THE FUTURE.total 6/10 (fell below expectation but the ratings are higher because i see this as a prequel for greater things to come,AND THAT AS ANY OTHER MOVIE EVEN AS AN ALTERNATIVE OPTION TO BOND THIS MOVIE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD, BUT AS A BOND FILM THIS MOVIE IS BELOW PAR )",6,0,0,1 February 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Just imagine if it were R Rated....
","PG-13, nothing sends shivers down my spine the way this rating does. When I learned that this movie had this curse upon it, I had to reduce my expectations, in the 'year of the sequels' good movies are hard to come by and there was no-way a PG-13 rated action movie was going to be up-to the mark right??!!!.WRONG.This movie was awesome, I'm a fan of the big summer blockbuster and firmly believe that movies like independence day and especially Jurassic Park deserve a mention in the Top 250 as they will be remembered and enjoyed much more than most movies on the list, honestly which of us have seen Citzen Kane, I did and thought it was OK.This movie has just upped the bar for PG-13 rated movies, I would like to go out on a limb and say it has nearly matched the levels of classics like JP and Ind. Day.(although they had less action) especially if you consider it is a sequel.The stunts were real, CG was at a minimum (Except for the F-35 track where some scenes were quite fake), the action was as brutal as can be for the rating (you can shoot as many time as you want just no blood the MPAA just fell another 2 notches in my respect list).The movie was long but it never felt like it, there were actually characters that were not stereotyped (no blacks, Asians, or Hispanics that seems misplaced), it was FUNNY, it was EXCITING,maybe even THOUGHT PROVOKING, all this even though it was a sequel.Len Wiseman has earned back all the respect he lost for the disappointing underworld evolution. For making a technically superb film. (editing was suspect because of what it think will be the unrated directors cut which will surely be on DVD).Some of the memorable albeit over the top scenes are the F-35 track, the subway, and the power factory.Logic has been compromised and any attempts to justify event, action sequences will only lead trouble, going along with the ride will only lead to happiness.So why am I whining?. Can you imagine what this movie would be like if it were R rated?.John Mclane is sanitised form of his former self, from a chain smoking, wise-ass, foul mouthed cop he has become a divorced struggling father who i don't even think says bullshit.There's no Yippy Kay Motherf#$$er when the villain dies in this movie.The villain did a good job but was no Hans Gruber , no cold blooded killing, maiming, no abusing, he actually looked like a poster boy more than anything else.And villains cant be totally bad nowadays can they, they have to have a heart and some justification for what they're doing, disgusting.Another complain I have is the graphic intensive computers and Hacking shown, come-on any engineer knows that no aspects of computers looks so pleasing, all these graphics actually make the move seem less real, they makers have to see movies of yesteryear's like Alien,The Thing or Sphere to see how scary and real a simple Dot Matrix screen can be.Despite the shedding of many stereotypes the rebellious teen and the geeky hacker rear their ugly head.The product placements especially of the nokia phones was quite annoying, The Palms were much more subtle and more appreciated than the in your face nokia ads.The fact is even though this movie maxes out as a PG-13 movie and a sequel an R-rating would have easily justified its place in the Top 250 movies of all time.Or maybe at 24 I'm already to old for the new breed of big-budget action movies and the days of the simple action movie are truly behind us.Watch this movie especially if your a fan of blockbuster cinema my cousin who liked his Die Hard when it was harder was quite disappointed with the over the top action sequences and teeny bopper humour.ITS A MUST WATCH WITH FAMILY OR FRIENDS EVEN IS THERE IS MERELY TOLERANCE TO BLOCKBUSTER CINEMA (EVEN DRAMA HUNGRY CRITICS WILL LIKE THIS FILM).Expect and you will still receive.-s purists(like me) will find many reasons to whine , PG-13, lacklustre villain, sanitised John Mclane, Plot holes.+/-s good family viewing, suitable to large audiences .+s lots of over the top and real action sequences , as good as can get PG-13 action, a great sequel, actually meets/exceeds expectations despite the rating.total 8-8.5/10 (My original rating of this movie was an 8.(considering its the best PG-13 action movie i remember seeing), but I have purposefully given it a rating of 7 in the hope of pulling down the already inflated ratings this movie is ahead of even the original die-hard on the Top 250 wtf .I assume that this is a combination of the fact this is not only the best movie of this summer but also the best sequel in a long time, the rat movie breaking into the top 100 shows that thanks to the ordinary movies this year people mistake even very good for the best).",7,4,8,4 July 2007
Lucy," Sets you up for Coacaine and Caviar......delivers Soggy Fries Instead
","For starters...I'm a big fan, I've been a fan since I became a movie buff in 2002, waiting patiently in line for the copy of Leon, La Femme Nikita etc etc to become available at the DVD library. Luc Besson is the pioneer of mixing multiple genres Kitsch , Art House,Action, Drama, Comedy always with a view to commercialism.All his trademarks are there, the car chase through an European City in an ordinary car, The Slap, Suave Calm but violent Sidekick, the Mexican Standoff with Classical Music, the claustrophobic action set, Love taking a backseat but always around.....etc etcBut If there's anything Luc Besson can do, its combine the feminine and the violent.He can make the same woman in the same clothes look ugly once, beautiful immediately after, sometimes he does it at the same time, he has shown Scarlet Johansson in lingerie and still not stirred you sexually.Its the same with violence, he glamorises it, but it repulses you at the same time, at other times the most grotesque act seems so cool.He has his fare share of critics if but none will disagree when I say that Luc Besson understands human emotions, violence and women. Respect.Despite the ridiculous plot(please don't go if you're going looking for plot holes and scientific logic), the actors have remained true to their work, ranging from honest to flashes of brilliance.Scarlet Johansson though I've maintained just doesn't have the versatility to play such roles, but she adds that glamour than unknown actresses just cant.Technically Luc Besson has been and will always remain brilliant, and analysis of this aspect of his movies can fill pages.In the end though I would like to describe my experience from this movie with the shortest of short illustrations.You go into a Chefs Signature Restaurant, you're super excited, your friends who don't know of him less so, but some of your enthusiasm has rubbed of on them and besides everyone in the restaurant does their job well and your waitress is smoking hot.He serves up signature dishes in the earlier course, stirring up all the areas of your tongue and taste buds, indeed even stirring up a whole range of emotions in everyone's body.Everyone is anxiously waiting for a fitting finale , everything is ripe for it, the musicians in the restaurant are building up a crescendo , your expecting, Foie de Gras , Cocaine and Caviar, Dal cooked for days bye a blind , deaf cripple.......The music is building....wait for it...The credit card and rolled paper comes in.....wait for it...The feel somewhere a salmon is being pulled from a fish tank...wait for it.....In the background you can see the dying old lady, stirring Dal ...wait for it....And then you get served Soggy Fries....The vagaries of human thought doesn't allow us to enjoy such an experience no matter how good the earlier courses were, if you've built yourself up for something and that doesn't happen, than almost nothing that happened along the way will matter.This my friend sums up my experience in the movie.-s Finalle will soon be included in the definition of #epicfail and damp squib.+/-s scarlet Johansson , ridiculous plot (sometimes too much even for me despite expecting it).+s Technically Luc Besson, signatures et all, Cast remains true.4/10...this discounts my epic disappointment as a fan, if your not a movie buff or a fan than you could probably add another star.",4,1,10,12 August 2014
300," Had everything but lacked soul..
","I was dying to see this movie from the time I heard of it especially since I'm a big fan of the R-rated gory battle movies and loved Sincity.The fact that there are no names in this movie hardly seemed important and wasn't in the end.The premise of this movie had limitless potential for the stylised bloodshed and swordplay that I love so much, the real battle was much less one sided (a thousand at a height against 1,00,000) but I was happy to learn that the movies would be taking liberties with history in order to make a more entertaining film.And entertaining it was.........It excelled in almost every field the visuals were brilliant (albeit very heavy on CG and the digital effects could be jarring for some) and every scene felt like a painting, the film had a similar comic book feel that Sincity had and similar film effects had a lot to do with it.The action scenes were brilliant albeit historically inaccurate, they were as brutal and gory as can be and I loved it. The action was well choreographed and it was great fun seeing a bunch of super warriors annihilate all sorts of stuff that was thrown at them. (Being Indian I found it hard to believe how the Greeks tackled elephants when ironically 300 elephants of Poruses army wiped out most of Alexanders if it wasn't for the storm that drove the elephants mad Alexander would have lost his entire army of 75000).The acting was good with the movie always remaining true to its comic book heritage with lots of short simple and effective dialogues peppered across the film and THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF ANY COMIC THE NARRATOR.The story was interesting and as with almost all history the stories that are remembered the most and the longest are the ones involving some tragedy or mishap (obviously the ultimate victor writes history but again the events that are remembered are the tragedies for either of the sides). People love the underdog here too a handful of great warriors taking on a massive army endears to the heart.The background score was decent and added to the movie.Technically the movie was near perfect with excellent direction and digital cinematography the way the comic book feel is created is brilliant.The short length of the movie ensured that you never lost interest for even a moment and enjoyed throughout the film.So why the low rating?!! Like I said the movie lacked a soul...The comic book dialogues were perfect for Sincity which was always about the comic but this movie involves an intense epic battle and the absolute lack of any stirring dialogue does more good than bad, scenes involving patriotism were absolutely lost, THOSE THAT ARE LESS EMOTIONAL ABOUT BATTLE MOVIES AND PATRIOTISM WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY THIS AS MUCH AS ME THOUGH.I loved the sheer amount of bloodshed but the lack of spirit that I was talking about surfaces here too though with the sheer number of deaths taking precedence over the intense personal fights between two great warriors that are shown in most movies involving epic battles.Im a person who fantasizes about dying for my country and gets easily stirred by battle and very emotional in those involving patriotism and the underdog,(i seriously believe that I may have been a warrior and freedon fighter in my past life) even then this movie failed to strike a chord in me (I'm one who gets emotional even in movies like Troy or Arthur which was supposed to be less intense than say a Braveheart).Maybe I set my expectations to high or wanted something from this movie that it was never supposed to have but a movie that seems tailor-made for me yet failed to stir me seems like a serious issue (save for patriotism and victory of the underdog I like my movie as simple as possible I like my fights gory, lots of murder (zombie flicks), my comedy crass and the women nude). So even though it was impossible for me not to like this movie it seriously fell below my expectations.The common critic always favour movies that have drama and going by the hype surrounding it I seriously felt this movie would have loads of spirit.The ending too was lack-lustre and could have been done much better especially considering the preceding comic book like story and action.In either case this movie is a much watch movie with just about enough to please the festival crowd and those who use the word cinema instead of movies.-s absolute lack of soul,lacklustre ending, fell below expectations.+/-s comic book feel (loved it Sincity though).+s superb technically, good acting, great action scenes with lots of blood and gore, hot chicks,short and sweet,very interesting story, suitable for all audiences.total 7/10 (ignoring the fact that it fell way below expectations lacklustre ending will be an issue even for people with different tastes and is a major factor in the lower rating).",7,1,3,2 April 2007
Click," Somehow this movie fails to click...
","Lets be frank anyone going in to see an Adam Sandler movie is going to pretty much see the following in the movie 1)A PG-13 rated comedy with jokes that will border on crude but will never ever cross the line.2)A movie where there is only one star (take a guess) and pretty much the whole world will revolve around him, hell even if you have a child in the film we will have him act like a bigger child, BASICALLY HE WILL PERFORM THE FUNCTION OF THE WOMAN, THE MAN, THE CHILD, THE FATHER, THE MOTHER, THE CRIMINAL,THE GOOD GUY ETC ...............IN THE SAME FILM.3)A movie about a social misfit who somehow makes it in life against odds and sooner or later realises the true meaning of his life.Safe to say that nothing different whatsoever can be expected from his films.YET....................There is some pleasure to be derived from watching such FEEL GOOD FORMULA FLICKS and once again I was drawn to this film.The movie started with some promise with David Hasselhof and his hot secretaries and Kate Beckinsale looking as hot as ever.Soon after the the main plot of the movie starts and your still laughing a lot...................Soon predictably things are not going so well for him and you wait for him to learn his lesson and the movie to end on a somewhat emotional, happy BUT lower note.But wait , he has to suffer some more till he learns his lesson, OK............ now its times isn't it?.........no wait there's still some suffering left...........phew finally let the poor man learn his lesson now................WAIT A MINUTE this man can suffer some more...........................................repeat this a few more times and you know how you will feel in this movie.His suffering and the movie does end finally and predictably but instead of the normal feel good factor that his movies end with this ones prolonged climax leaves you with a bad taste.Acting from the entire cast is good with no overacting from anyone.Cristopher Walken played the role of another quirk with panache I'm A COUPLE OF FILMS AWAY FROM BEING FEDUP OF SEEING HIM PLAY ANOTHER QUIRK THOUGH.The star of the show for me was David Hasselhoff who played his role of the Dilbertish Boss perfectly.The special effects and modern artwork of this movie was actually top class and of the level you would expect in a sci-fi movie.Techinically this movie is up there but ONCE AGAIN the fact that a weak plot and storyline can ruin the most technically perfect movie is proved.The movie does have its moments though like a couple of hilarious scenes with David H and some others involving Adam Sandler towards the beginning of the movie when he gets the remote.In all another ADAM SANDLER FORMULA FLICK .....THAT HAS ITS MOMENTS BUT FAILS TO CLICK.(hehe) Wouldn't recommend you rent it unless you are a big fan of Adam.-s the formula fails, overdrawn and overbearing ending +/s typical Adam Sandler film.+s some moments, David Hasselhoff, great technically (as ever higher budget film is) total 5/10 (factoring in the fact that you know its an Adam Sandler movie)",5,9,20,9 September 2006

Not the kind that has seen every episode and remembers them but I've seen a few hundred of them and thats a lot.Was I looking forward to this movie?No s#$t.Did I have sky high expectations from this movie?Surprisingly I didn't.(not that surprising if you consider the kind of bug hype movies that have let down expectations this year).Basically I'm describing the a whole bunch of people, which includes a large portion of North America.Im all for the feature length and big screen adaptations of popular serials, and genuinely feel that often the larger running time, canvas and BUDGET, add a whole lot to the serials.This was true in lots of cases, especially in the big screen adaptations of yesteryear's serials like Charlie's angels (it had its moments), The X-files, serenity etc.But if the 'BIGGER EVERYTHING', isn't going to add much to the movie, then i don't see the reason why I should be spending 240 rs, to watch the movie, when I can watch the serial for free, or watch it on TV later.Unfortunately this was the case in the movie.The graphics were only at par with the serial, and the slightly deviations from the style on TV was more of a distraction than a genuine addition.The Dolby surround was used but added nothing to the movie.Im sure the budget was several times the serials (and not proportionate to 87/22, the average serial run time to this movies length), but this did nothing for the movie.The longer length could have meant many more gags and a rare instance of lots of parallel stories plots and sub-plots, with larger than normal footage given to more than a couple of characters (usually besides the family only a few characters are given much footage), but instead it ended up being almost boring in a few parts, IN BETTER DAYS THE BEST JOKES FROM THIS MOVIE AND A LESS STRETCHED OUT PLOT WOULD HAVE FORMED A STANDARD 30 MIN SERIAL OR AT MOST A ONE HOUR SPECIAL.Still the movie had its moments.The standard Simpson's humour was all there, many jokes were hilarious and some had the spark that has often been found missing in the later seasons, the few jokes with Burns and Irish boy, had me reminiscing and laughing at the same time.Although it came close never ever did this movie cross into boring territory, every time you thought that this movie was going to lose a hand, it pulled out an ace from its sleeve.THE GUEST APPEARANCES WERE HILARIOUS, and as big ticket as can get.The shorter than average length insured that you never OD'ed on people you weren't used to seeing in slabs of more than half an hour.SO WERE THE JOKES GOOD AND THE MOVIE ENTERTAINING??YES!??.BUT DOES IT MEAN THAT THIS MOVIE HAD TO BE MADE AND THAT WE SHOULD PAY FULL TICKET PRICES AND WATCH IT IN A THEATER.I don't think so....So if you have to watch this movie (and indeed you should), then please only watch it on DVD, at really really cheap prices in the theater, or better still on good ol TV where I have been enjoying Simpson's since the last 15 years.-s 'BIGGER EVERYTHING' adds nothing to this movie, feels like a stretched out 1 hour special, potential far from exploited.+/-s did this movie and its theatrical release need to happen, i certainly don't think so.+s jokes were still funny (albiet with breaks of mediocrity), a couple of scenes had that old spark, never bored.total 6/10 (only because i had fun, however it was only as much fun as i would have had seeing it on TV, and because luckily i didn't have that many expectations, if i consider the fact that i felt kind of cheated watching this movie than this movie will crossover below 5 in my opinion).ps The fact that such ordinary cinema has broken the top 250 list is truly scary and its taken me a lot off effort not to change my original rating to a much lower one, only to get the overall rating down.",6,5,8,20 August 2007
V for Vendetta," Nothing like what you would expect but likable nevertheless!
","Lets face it a lone man fighting against a totalitarian society in the future is a most unoriginal concept and I really expected to no originality from the movie the only way i thought the brothers would make this film work would be to cram it with some mind boggling special effects and action ala Matrix.I went into this movies expecting another action and special effects extravaganza in the lines of the matrix and i must say that the trailers were most misleading in this context and led me to believe that was indeed an action film.Well this was any thing but an action film.It has 2 or 3 mediocre action scenes and fans of the brothers and people who like only action movies will be severely disappointed.To make up for the lack of action the creators have in fact resorted to tactics that are original but are like gimmicks that performers use to enthrall the audience. some of which are--the hero of the film whose face is never seen throughout the film (Hugo Weaving doing what he does best Dub)is a 'V' obsessed, limerick quoting British who is obsessed with historical events.-- The supporting cast is absolutely brilliant and has some of the best actors from the British film industry all of which have performed brilliantly and easily overshadowed the two main leads. Special mention for Ben miles who i loved in coupling and who held his own here.---Natalie Portman is a bald actress who is made this way by her not so obvious tormentors.............who does anything but you expect a bald actress in a thriller to do to.The few special effects in this movie are as expected top class but the background music of this movie is absolutely forgettable.The movie a couple of great scenes both of which come in the end - we have one in which the detective predicts how the revolution will unfold that demonstrates an acute knowledge of human psyche. - and the other of the actual revolution. If you like such arty cinema you will love this film.Well the above points make this movie watchable even though this movie is not what you expect. Although i must add i feel this involves some things that are more Art House and quite like gimmicks.Also this movie loses at least a couple of points for originality.If you go into this movie with a open mind you will enjoy this film.",6,1,2,16 April 2006
