Raiders of the Lost Ark," This guy's the HERO???????
","Has anyone noticed what an incompetent bungler dearest Indy is? How EVERY TIME he comes up against Belloq he LOSES whatever he has--statues, girls, the Ark itself? As Belloq puts it at the beginning (approximately), 'Once again we see that there is nothing you can recover that I cannot take from you.' And he's absolutely correct--right up to the Ark TWICE!! It happens EVERY TIME!! The only thing Indy manages to do right is find the Ark itself--and Belloq promptly grabs it away, because gee, guess what? They're digging on a knoll against the setting sun right next to the Nazis' dig, and making no secret of it. Till finally at the end God Himself has to save the day. Good thing for Indy (and the rest of us I guess) He's on the side of the democracies. Which opens all sorts of theological questions and problems I won't touch. Mind you, Indy can work miracles too--he can ride a submarine thousands of miles across the ocean without drowning, or even getting wet. AND keep the Nazis cooped up inside the whole time (a very good thing since there's no place to hide on the sub's hull). To be fair to the movie, Indy is such a lovable lug (and it was so nice to see that Ford was finally learning to act) that only the sub ride bothered me initially. To fully grasp IJ's incompetence I had to see 'Raiders' several times. Which I did, but that only shows I have a weakness for roller coasters and gratuitously fx-heavy endings, however illogical. Mea culpa.",Null,0,0,23 January 2006
Gone with the Wind," Can't separate content from context--and oh those ayksents!
","One of the ways I knew I really did love my wife was that I was able to sit with her all the way through this monstrous tripe. Had tried a couple of times before without success. Afterward we had a big argument about it of course--she was stuck on the hopeless romanticism of the thing which I saw as Grand Ole Soap Opry. Not to mention the simple fact that whether you like it or not, both book and movie glorify the most degrading and longest-lasting oppression visited by one people upon another since The Grandeur That Was Rome. Imagine this story in a more modern context, with Scahlett and her precious crew as Germans in the 1930s and Mammy and her folk as Jews. Somehow I doubt such a movie would've been made. I will allow that the movie unintentionally provides an accurate barometer of the pathetic state of race relations (non-relations?) in pre-WWII America.And oh those AWFUL accents! A Georgian friend of mine thinks the movie was made as an insult to the Old South that no one gets.",2,12,34,22 March 2008
Once Upon a Time in America," Sorry, not the greatest movie ever made
","A disappointment. Living proof of 2 old adages: 'too many cooks spoil the broth' and 'the longer the joke, the bigger the punchline has to be.' Too many cooks definitely hurt this flick, and as long as the movie is, it should've had a MUCH bigger punchline. In this case the journey was far more enjoyable than the destination. It would've been nice if the bunch that wrote the first part had communicated a little better with the crew that did the second, so we'd have a more coherent second part. After the intermission we are introduced to a whole new Max, one who suddenly is Bugsy Siegel and flips out periodically (which he never did before) because his old man was nuts (which we never knew before), and whose life ambition is to knock over a Federal Reserve bank--which we not only haven't been told before but he and he crew have (as far as we know) never even robbed a bank! At the inexcusably weak punch line, a long talky confrontation between a still newer Max and Noodles (did we ever find out how he got that stupid nickname?) we also learn that Noodles is a stone cold killer who Secretary Max wants to kill him, for reasons that are muddy at best. Almost as muddy as the way he went from street tough to Cabinet member. This despite Noodles' not having killed a single person in the whole flick--in fact having gone ballistic when people were killed. Say WHAT?? I won't even go into the whole business with the garbage truck and the amazing disappearing whozit. Even the commentary throws up its hands at that. And finally there's the whole 'friendship/loyalty' schtick. It works for the kid versions of Noodles and Max, but De Niro and Wood have NO chemistry at all. They act friends because the script says so, but that's all. Woods has never had chemistry with anyone, in any flick. And I thought the first US release was muddled. The movie should've stayed with the kids.",Null,4,10,20 September 2015
Grindhouse," Planet Si, Death No!
","Can 't give Grindhouse a number because it would be overly generous to 'Death' and unfair to 'Planet.' If I did 'twould be a 5 because 'Death' gets a 1 and 'Planet' a 10. The word for 'Death' is BOOOORRRRIIIINNNGGGGGGGG!! A total of roughly 1 hour 40 minutes of useless dialog between uninteresting characters and maybe 10 minutes (maybe more) of car action that the 'Mad Max' movies did better. Sorry, Q, you blew this one to hell. Even fast-forwarding through the dull stretches I actually had time to sit there and wonder where Kurt Russell's psycho would get the scratch for his cars to do this silliness more than once. Seems a reedickle-dockle way of killing girls. And Micheal Parks' cameo is the most superfluous time waster since the bar scene in 'Desperado.' 'Planet Terror', now, is great. A combo of 'Dusk Till Dawn' and 'Night of the Living Dead', this is probably the goriest GOOD flick I've seen since 'Reanimator' and 'Bride of.' It's balls to the wall, pedal to the metal, with enough surprises to keep things supercharged. Glad I didn't see this duo in the theaters, if 'Death' came first I'd never have made it to 'Planet' which would've been a pity.",Null,0,0,2 November 2007
War of the Worlds," Well-camouflaged nonsense
","That Spielberg is still one helluva director, maybe even a great one, is evidenced by the effectiveness with which he disguises the fact that this movie is almost as nonsensical as 'Independence Day.' Tom Cruise helps by leaving his superstardom off camera and doing a fairly effective job of portraying Joe Average, and Dakota Fanning does an even better job of being (not playing) a real kid--not too smart, not too witty or brave and at times literally scared out of her wits. The main problem is that Spielberg wants to give a worms-eye view of this worldwide catastrophe, and whether he succeeds or fails in this (and he does both) it sinks the movie. There's so much that just doesn't make sense and begs for explanation, which we don't get. When were the machines buried, and why? Given the amount of digging under New York (subways, sewers, sub-basements) why has no one ever unearthed one of these contraptions? Since this burial had to have happened long before the area was inhabited, how did so many just happen to be buried under land that would one day be a major metropolis? Why does their ray leave clothing untouched, yet blasts buildings to flinders? Why is the military so helpless against these monsters? We only see one battle, and not nearly enough of that. As Cruise's son says, 'I want to see more.' We never even get any theories about where these things come from--it obviously isn't Mars from the way they prance around. There are some gorgeous moments--the clothes falling like snow from the sky, the burning train hurtling past--yet the whole doesn't hold together. No surprise since David Koepp wrote the screenplay and logic isn't his specialty either. But then what do you expect from a writer & director who send a T Rex strolling through a San Diego suburb at night without waking anyone up or meeting even one car?",6,0,1,3 February 2008
Bram Stoker's Dracula," A visual treat but woefully miscast--and plagiarized without credit
","A floridly stylized and overheated, even operatic (Italian opera of course, this being Coppola) take on the book, but one of the most faithful. Gorgeously designed and visualized, yet it barely survives its casting. Did FFC really think that Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves were the best available?? On the one hand Ryder handles the complexities of Mina's character (far greater than in the book) well, while Reeves is as wooden and inarticulate as ever, but neither can do an English accent to save their lives. Coppola underlines this lack by pitting them against authentic Brits like Sadie Frost and Tony Hopkins' cheerfully demented Van Helsing. The other Yank, Tom Waits as Renfield, does much better. The real casting disaster is Gary Oldham's Drac. Coppola and Hart have re-imagined this monster into one of the great Romantic (in the Byronic sense) characters, a combination of Richard the Lionheart, Don Juan, Faust and the Flying Dutchman, yet he's played by a rather plain, short and strange character (in the definitely non-Byronic sense) actor who tries so hard to avoid imitating Lugosi that his accent is possibly the ugliest in movie history, and sillier than Kevin Costner's attempt at a Back Bay drawl in '13 Days.' Where was Daniel Day Lewis? Anyone check with Patrick Bergin or Stephen Rea? Oldman is fine as Old Weird Drac in the castle but my girlfriend (a sucker for romance at all costs, see my review of 'GWTW') began shaking her head the moment he started playing up to Mina in London, and by the end of the flick had developed a crick in her neck. Too bad, too--the forbidden romance, which BTW was ripped off from the protean Dick Matheson's version with Jack Palance (which he took from the Karloff 'Mummy'), works well to unify a story that sprawls all over the place, and gives the ending real power. I'll close with a note on the DVD: the 5.1 is particularly effective in the castle, with creepy little scratchings and whispers and sounds all over the back channels. And the Coppola commentary is fine, he indulges in much less whining than in his 'Godfather' apologia. ADDENDUM: According to his commentary, Ryder brought Coppola onto the picture, so she was a given. Too bad they couldn't get her a decent dialog coach to give her a Brit accent at least as good as Angelina Jolie's, if not the quality of Lisa Eichhorn in 'Cutter's Way' whom I was amazed to find was a Yank, not a Brit.",7,0,0,15 April 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Bit of a disappointment after the first two
","The only one of the trilogy I have serious problems with. Not that I haven't watched the Extended DVD many times, but I only saw it once in the theater, unlike the previous (thrice each). Generally great considering that PJ is cramming half the entire trilogy into one flick, but to me he blew the deaths and departures pretty completely. All of 'em. Beginning with Saruman, who dies like a cheap thug (Charles Bronson in '4 For Texas' died the same way). C'mon, Pete, we're talking about one of the 3 most powerful beings in Middle Earth here! Stab-plummet-splash?? That's IT??? He should've fallen like a comet and Worm should've at least burst into flames when he stabbed him. And since he dies at Orthanc (a good choice), the tower should've been thrown down at the same time, providing a good bookend for the (first) finale. Second is Theoden, who dies according to the book and very well--then is totally completely utterly FORGOTTEN! Not borne from the field in high honor (30 seconds more) or even mentioned. Poor old guy. Then we have Sauron, who bursts like a bubble. Wow. A few seconds for the master villain of a 10 hour flick. Where was the towering lightning-crowned figure of shadow looming over Mordor and stretching out a vast impotent hand to the West? Or at least loping over the hills hauling a steamer trunk of odd socks? At least he took most of Mordor with him. And the Nazgul--what DID happen to them? First thing I did when the DVD came out was slo-mo through that sequence and it STILL isn't clear. Snap-crackle-oops, no pop. At least the Witch King went out in style because they followed the book. More on him in a moment. Finally Frodo's departure--WHAAATT? I had to explain to a friend of mine who hadn't read the trilogy why he had to leave, because the movie sure doesn't make it clear. He mentions that the wound from Weathertop 'has never healed' but it looks about as serious as a mild case of indigestion. He shoulda been a lot sicker than that, and in the book he was. Finally we come to the bit that angers me more than any of this: when the Witch King breaks Gandalf's staff. What kind of idiocy is that?? I refer to my previous statement about the most powerful beings in Middle Earth--Saruman, Sauron and Gandalf (they're all Maia, f'Pete's sake)! The Witch King would've had less chance against G than a hobbit against a mumakil, yet according the beginning when Gandalf breaks Saruman's staff the movie is telling us that the WK is more powerful than G. Nonsense. The Don knew this, that's why he cut the confrontation short. Fortunately the DVD is banded so I can skip that part. Despite all this it's a fitting finale to the trilogy which I am enjoying more now. Maybe I'm finally getting used to Sam's whining.",8,0,3,11 July 2007
Jurassic Park," Great Dinos, and that's all
","Sloppy story-telling from start to finish. It's pretty obvious Spielberg didn't give a damn about anything but the dinosaurs, especially not about tight, coherent plotting or believable characters. When I taught screenplay writing in Santa Fe NM I used 'JP' as a perfect example of how even established directors who should know better can forget what's important. But Saint Steven's always cared more for effects than logic. And the dinos are impressive, even now. They almost distract one from the illogic of that first Grand Revelation with the brachiosaurs, as definitive a moment for fantasy as the star destroyer's overhead entrance in 'Star Wars.' But Sam Neill & Co approach these walking skyscrapers over a mile or so of gently rolling terrain, and they don't notice them until they're almost under hoof. Like I said, effect over logic. Too many of the characters are superfluous or just plain unbelievable. Jeff Goldblum doesn't add a thing to the plot, he just cracks wise and makes pretentious pronouncements (a faculty he perfected in the sequel). In the book his broken leg gave them a time limit to get off the island before the break went septic, but nothing like that here. Once his leg is broken he's basically forgotten. And Richard Attenborough's John Hammond is a kindly old Scots Santa Claus here, but sends his beloved grandkids out into a park that's chock full of dangerous predators--and even more dangerous computer bugs. In the book at least he was a nasty old SOB, though it was still a thin device. Bad plotting: Wayne Knight has lived on the island for months yet can't find his way to the dock because of a rain storm and a fallen sign?? And why bother with the 'life will out' theme when it makes no difference? The creatures don't get off the island as they do in the book, so who cares if they can reproduce? If you want to leave room for a sequel, simply dump that and the 'lysine contingency' and save some time. And finally we come to the biggest fraud of all: the ending, a classic dino ex machina. They're saved from raptors in the nickest of nicks by the T Rex! Who's announced his approach hitherto by making like Godzilla, but here apparently walks on tippy-toes. This was Steverino's inspiration, which shows he knew which side of the movie his box office was buttered on. To paraphrase Eric Clapton about a new rock group he'd just formed called Cream: 'Forget the plot! Forget the characters! Just dinos!' My solution: after the Rex saves our hapless crew, he chases 'em all the way to the chopper, maybe even grabs a strut in his jaws as the whirlybird is lifting off, and Neill has to hang out and kick them free. Oh well, Spielberg proved with 'Crystal Skulls' he doesn't know when to quit, so it may happen yet.",6,19,40,10 July 2009
