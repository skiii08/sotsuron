Antz," The more intelligent, witty, adult-oriented Bug's Life
","This film is an exceptional piece of animation. Where as a Bug's Life uses cutesy soft textured animation, the style in Antz is much grittier. Not only is the animation different, but there is different quality of voice acting and casting for the roles. The likes of Stallone, Lopez and Allen are perfectly suited to their roles and deliver one of there most memorable performances. Without giving too much away there is a battle scene which has a Starship Troopers-esque goriness that accentuates the horrors and futility in their lives that they are constantly burdoned with. On a basic level, the film is exciting enough with a fantastic balance of humour and action for younger audiences. But the underlying subtext and social commentary on humans in a style that differs from the moralising of Disney, is what differentiates this with many other cartoons.",9,0,0,28 April 2004
