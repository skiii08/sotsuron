Blade Runner 2049," A worthy sequel to the finest film of all time
","I had so much concern the movie would bomb,being a super fan of the original..But it delivered on every aspect. One of the finest films in years..",9,2,6,31 October 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Slow??
","Any reviews saying the film is slow is likely because its over their heads and should maybe stick to fluffy action films with nothing intelligent to portray..
Evert aspect from the characters,direction, to the soundtrack is truly world class film making..
I really scratch my head with any poor reviews and what is it they seek in movie entertainment..Give it a shot..You'll love it.",9,2,8,31 October 2019
Hereditary," It will rip your soul out!!!!!!!
","This film is in the same league as the absolute classics of horror..The Shinning,The Exorcist,The Thing,Alien..Leaves ya feeling uneasy and that's what a horror film should do..I will watch this movie every once in awhile for the rest of my life",9,0,3,31 October 2019
Blade Runner," Its simply the finest movie ever made
","Its got everything a movie could offer..A marvel in cinema.
I wish I could give it more stars!!!!!",10,1,2,31 October 2019
