The Blair Witch Project," CRAP ON A STICK
","If your opinion of SCARY is watching episodes of Kolchak: The Night Stalker...then this is for you. Okay, that said, I see no value in this film....but if folks out there 'like' it...whatever...fine. But if you are gonna tell me that THIS actually SCARED you?....then I suggest you stay in your house for the rest of your life, cause crossing against the light on a DESERTED STREET is SCARIER than this junk. If yelling, out of control, CONSTANTLY SWEARING and telling each other to 'shut the camera' THROUGHOUT the movie is for you, then God Bless. However, if you WANT to be spooked, I suggest checking out The St. Francisville Experiment for REAL CHILLS, and an attempt at a mock documentary of what it may actually be like investigating a REAL haunted house. (No the house aint really haunted, but the film is MUCH better) Did it borrow the idea from Blair Witch?...sure did...they even ask in the film if anyone seen 'BWP'...but so what...it not only borrowed the idea...it SURPASSED it....and please, for the love of God, do yourself a favor and see 'The Last Broadcast'...the film that BWP went to and 'borrowed' from.",1,2,4,28 February 2002
Blade II," Still trying to catch my breath!
","Whew! Blade II is one WILD, KINETIC, FRENETIC, & ENERGETIC THRILL RIDE! I liked 'Blade'...but Blade II is 3X better, cooler, faster, meaner, and sped up! Somebody CHAIN this director to a movie set until he cranks out at LEAST 2 MORE! RUN..(or drive)...but dont HESITATE to see this flick! This was COOL! :)",8,0,2,22 March 2002
Blade II," ONE DAMN FINE ACTION/HORROR FLICK!
","I commented before, but seeing that some geekey FANBOYS are poo-pooing this movie as the worst they've ever seen...Folks....do you do what I do when you read such cliched crap? I go into their comments on other films they rated to see where they are coming from in their taste in movies to say such INANE things about this flick...YEP...that figures....People who say stuff like that think 3000 Miles to Graceland is GREAT STUFF! Talk about a movie that is pointless, gratuitous, etc, Others who whine and moan cause it didnt follow the formula of the first...OH POOR BABIES!.....go play a video game or something you nerds....its 2 years LATER....Do you do everything the same today as you did 2 years ago in your life?...WHY SHOULD ALL VILLAINS BE THE SAME?... Jeesh.....get one first (a life) before you comment on charactor, plot, developement in a movie. Blade II is a stand alone, grab ya by the you know what action/horror flick....the CGI ROCKS! The first CGI scene where Blade is fighting one of those 'Ninja' VAMPS WAS/IS INTENDED to be identified as CGI renditions! It was an artistic choice on the directors part to cross animate in a LIVE ACTION FILM! NOWHERE in the rest of the film is CGI noticable and obvious when used (Even though we know when cgi is taking effect) In closing....Dont just read some blithering cliched comment without going into the users file and reading ALL their comments to get an idea on their taste in movies..(mine included)...AND FINALLY...All these are just opinions...but MINE carry more weight in logic and reason than MANY of the others.... ;) FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF by GOING TO THE MOVIE if the subject matter INTERESTS (YOU)!",8,0,4,31 March 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," UTTERLY FASCINATING!
","FINALLY! After DREG such as: Tomb Raider, Mummy Returns, Ghosts of Mars, Evolution...comes a fantasy film to end ALL fantasy films! This movie is so engrossing, I didnt even know 3 hours went by! I have never read the books, but one doesnt need to familarize themselves ahead of time, because the beginning of the film supplies a GREAT backstory prologue to let the viewer know the required info. Incredible SFX, writing, directing, and acting...I actually BELIEVED there was a Wizard named Gandolf...thats how GREAT Ian is in the role! Run....or drive....but do NOT hesitate to see this FILM!",9,0,0,27 December 2001
Pearl Harbor," GREAT MOVIE
",Its already made $100 million in one week of home video sales..does THAT tell ya something? This is a VERY GOOD WELL CRAFTED MOVIE. There are 2 types of movie going people... Those who like Black Knight/Tomb Raider/Ghosts of Mars...and those who like Pearl Harbor/The Rock/Armageddon.... The LATTER are the ones whose opinions you should listen too...cause the first group probably think DICE CLAY still has much to offer the world of comedy...yeah...right... :),10,5,11,13 December 2001
Pearl Harbor," A PHENOMENAL FILM
","Big deal, there's a love story..but its a GOOD one...The acting is GREAT....the action sequences are MIND BLOWING and JAW DROPPING...if you like the Micheal Bay signature touches...slow mo, upward camera angles, etc....if you like Armageddon & The Rock...you should have no problem here...dont get me wrong..there is much more to this movie than Bay's previous efforts...he has OUTDONE himself! But be warned before picking up the DVD...the studios are gonna release a Director's cut R rated version (with more battle stuff, about 3 minutes...and cut down some of the love interest) in May...still, this is a MUST RENT on dvd...this is a VERY GOOD movie...but maybe those guys who need to be in Macho mode all the time and are afraid to cry, should stay away....cause this is a movie for a MAN who is SECURE within himself :)",10,5,11,5 December 2001
Resident Evil," YESSSSsssssss!!!!!
","HOLY SHNIKIES!Not a 'gamer', never saw the game either. But this flick ROCKS! Some folks here with NO TASTE have said Paul Anderson's Event Horizon & Soldier STINK....but yet still like this film...well, glad they liked it, but they dont have a clue about what good sci-fi IS...oh they will will ALWAYS say, 'BLADE RUNNER' & 'ALIEN'...which are good flicks....but get the HELL out of the past people! You're NEVER gonna enjoy a sci fi flick if you keep comparing it to the same 2 movies ALL THE TIME! Jeesh...get over it already.THAT said, Its about TIME a Zombie flick has come along, that with the exception of 'Night of the Living Dead', has finally flushed the bad tatse out of my mouth that was left there with Romero's INSIPIDLY LOUD, BADLY ACTED, BADLY SFX'd and MAKEUP'd Zombie remakes.... DOWN with DAWN and DAY OF THE DEAD...LONG LIVE RESIDENT EVIL & its SEQUELS!!!",5,0,0,15 March 2002
Moulin Rouge!," PURE SPECTACLE!
","Uniquely crafted movie musical, that is utterly absorbing! Stunning visuals, incredible production design, excellant choreography, great singing from Nicole & Ewan....COOL SONGS! I wish more modern musicals were made for the big screen....I'd go see this in a MINUTE if it ever becomes an actual stage play! GET THIS FILM ON DVD....NOW!",8,0,1,18 December 2001
Mulholland Drive," A DREAM...CAPTURED on FILM!
","In the last 10 or so years, there have only been a handful of flicks that have actually 'gotten to me' and 'made me think' (Usually, I am the guy who calls people NERDS when they spout off such 'cliches'...but man, I gotta tell ya, this film has BLOWN ME AWAY) I have seen it 3 times now. The first time, I dozed off twice, but went back to see what I missed (in fairness to the flick)It was fairly interesting, but I was kinda bored. The ending annoyed me. But yet, this film 'stayed with me' for a week. I went here to Imdb to read others' opinions, and found that maybe I was shortchanging this film (like I did at first with Memento) and didnt WANT to like it, cause it was CHALLENGING me to THINK. (I know, another cliche phrase) I rented it again and sat thru it with somewhat of an idea of what was going on. By the time the scene where the diva is singing 'Crying' in Spanish, I was enraptured by this movie. By the ending, I was BLOWN AWAY. The third time I seen it, I was STILL noticing nuances in Namoi Watts' 'Becky'/Diane charactor. The fact that this girl didnt get nominated for an Academy Award is a TRAVESTY of the HIGHEST ORDER. I think I witnessed one of the single greatest peformances of an actress in the last decade! Generally, I am not into ANYTHING 'surreal'...but what David Lynch has accomplished here is downright ERRIE! He has captured the way we/I DREAM on film! The way we 'interpose' people, places, names, etc....and yet when we awake and try to explain what seemed so LOGICAL in our dream, is now just an incoherant BABBLE to our waking brain. BUT...I can honestly state that what makes this film a MASTERPIECE to behold, is that he (Lynch) is able to make what we have just seen, 98% explainable....when was the last time we awoke from a dream and were able to explain 50% in a logical manner? This film is a bittersweet, tragic and sad tale of broken dreams, broken hearts...and broken minds. Symbolic without being pretentious....CHOKE ON THAT INGMAR BERGMAN! Is Mulholland Drive the BEST film I have ever seen? No....but its up there...it IS however, the MOST FASCINATING piece of filmmaking ever committed to celluoid...and I remain STUNNED. Thank you Mr. Lynch.",9,2,3,14 May 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," BORING
","I was VERY DIS-Enchanted by this movie. Wooden acting, special effects that are shoddy, or at best, 'ok'. Return of the Jedi is HIGH ART compared to this snore-fest. Parents, do your children a favor, and introduce them to The Wizard of Oz before THIS mess, and watch how their good taste in film will come alive with Oz, and how they will FALL ASLEEP with this clunker. I really like Bicentennial Man (directed by Chris Columbus as well) but I felt NOTHING magical with Harry Potter....it cannot be cause I am an adult.....I still admire Wizard of Oz...I even think Hocus Pocus is cute.....but this movie? NO WAY. 6/10 (and I'm being generous due to the some of the production values)",6,0,1,29 May 2002
Vanilla Sky," VERY GOOD SCI FI
","For those who ALSO appreciate sci fi for its STORY instead of SFX, space ships, aliens, etc (ala 'GATTACA') you wont be disappointed. Tom Cruises' most unusual performance to date; and a VERY GOOD one at that. Cameron Crowe outdoes himself. I'm in dvd hog heaven; with the likes of Vanilla Sky, Memento, Mulholland Drive & Donnie Darko, I dont know what to do with myself! HOLLYWOOD...KEEP'EM COMMIN'!",9,0,0,22 May 2002
Rock Star," ROCK ON!
","This is a pretty decent film. It would have been nice if a little Cameron Crowe or Paul Thomas Anderson style was infused into it, but its not a bad effort. The songs are GREAT...as well as the performances of Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Aniston...these 2 SHINE. I HIGHLY recommend the DVD..the image is INCREDIBLY SHARP and BURSTING with COOL use of color! The Rock show scenes are TOTALLY REALISTIC as well. ENJOY!",8,0,1,22 January 2002
