The King's Speech," The King's Speech
","1930s England: Albert, Duke Of York (Colin Firth) has lived with a stutter all his life which makes the sudden intrusion of radio technology into the Royal life a nightmare. His wife, Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), after trying every conventional therapist she can, seeks the assistance of a recommended Australian, Lyle Logan (Geoffrey Rush), whilst bitter conflicts loom both in Europe and in the Royal Family itself...Tom Hooper's excellent film takes a subject matter which many can relate to - simply the annoyance of a speech impediment - and gives us what is essentially a high-brow bromance. In it he is aided spectacularly by a brilliant cast, a witty script and lovely cinematography.Though Firth is gaining all the awards buzz - and rightly so, for his performance as Bertie is a wonderful example of a hard working actor - one should not step away from the importance of Geoffrey Rush in this film. His failed actor is constantly upbeat and funny, so that when he is made the victim of abuse or class snobbery we genuinely feel for him. The partnership that this creates is both charming and rewarding, and you feel that this is a proper friendship developing.The secondary characters involved with this partnership are also very well played; in particular, Carter brings a quiet wit to her role of the future Queen Mother. Perhaps the least convincing role is that of Guy Pearce's pretentious Edward, though this is more down to the script forming him as the most 2D role in the film.When the script works well, though, it crackles. The excellent scenes of speech therapy are both interesting and joyful to watch. Viewers should be advised that in one scene there is an awful lot of bad language which is one of the few laugh-out-loud moments of the film, feeling just right in the mixture; it arrives at the correct time.The whole point of the film - the actual speech of the film's title - is perhaps the most depressing part of it, yet it seems a triumph, for the new King must tell his people that their country is at war again. We don't need to see what happens during the war, or hear the speeches he mad afterwards - for him this was the greatest point of his life, of his reign. He had fought the demons of his life and was now able to stand up and be counted as someone his people could fight the demons overseas for.The film is always engaging, interesting and, most importantly, has a good heart with many chuckles. Thoroughly recommended.8/10",8,1,2,18 January 2011
Black Swan," Black Swan
","Nina (Natalie Portman) has been given her big chance at long last: she has been cast to play the Swan Queen in a new production of 'Swan Lake'. But already pressure is building: her mother (Barbara Hershey) is trying to control her, a new dancer (Mila Kunis) could be trying to steal her role, and her director (Vincent Cassel) doesn't believe the darker side of her role, the Black Swan to her White...'Black Swan' is ridiculous, insane and brilliant. It is a return to the brilliant form of director Darren Aronofsky's epic 'The Fountain' - a stunning blend of art, psychology and classic film genres, all of which add up to a uniquely stunning film.That being said, it starts off slowly - very slowly. The titles echoing the most obvious reference, 'The Red Shoes', before we start to explore the story of Nina. But this gradual build up works eventually; the tension rises and rises, picking up pace as the film progresses, until the last 45 minutes when, literally, all hell breaks loose, and you are at a loss as to what you are watching is really happening or not.Natalie Portman is amazing - never away from the camera, her character and the breakdown she suffers captivates the storyline and holds you tight in its grasp. Her performance will surely go down as one of the greatest of her career, defining her as an actress of her own rights, removing her from your memory of her in the sad, wooden Star Wars prequels. It is often incredibly difficult to tell whether or not it is her dancing or a body double.The ballet scenes are shot wonderfully; though this is certainly a film that is not just about ballet, it still plays a pivotal role, aided by the brilliant, memorable soundtrack of Tchaikovsky's work, and adding real depth to the story and to the characters, as they echo the core themes of the ballet itself: desire, deception, death.The film is not perfect, sadly; the script is most certainly full of clich√©s, resembling a high-budget erotic thriller at times more linked with something like 'Basic Instinct'. Cassell's character in particular is a tried and tested formula of the teacher who lusts after his own students. There is a nice cameo appearance from Winona Ryder as a faded star, and one feels that more could have been made out of her character. Kunis is almost in danger of becoming a very 2D bad girl, but the script saves her as it sweeps the rug from under the audience's feet in a bizarre set of twists.There are jumps a plenty, a few quite bloody scenes and, of course, the much talked about lesbian scene, which really isn't at all what it says it is on the tin. Be warned - this is not just a film about ballet. Ultimately, this is a film about obsession and madness, a companion piece to Aronofsky's last work, 'The Wrestler' - where that was about a tried old man, this is about a scared young girl.Utterly compelling once it gets properly started, this film will, like all of Aronofsky's work, divide everyone who goes to see it. Brilliant.8/10",8,1,3,25 January 2011
Lucky Number Slevin," Lucky Number Slevin - the Kiss Kiss Bang Bang of 2006
","I think I can confidently say that 'Lucky Number Slevin' was the 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' of 2006. It looked like 'KKBB', it sounded like 'KKBB', and I enjoyed it as much as 'KKBB'.The weird thing was that I didn't think I would, namely because of Josh Hartnett in the title role. And yet he surprised me, just as Val Kilmer did in 'KKBB', by pulling off a brilliant performance in understatement. Compared to the heavyweights - Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsly, Bruce Willis, Stanley Tucci - he seemed calm and assured throughout. In the scenes with Lucy Lui he was actually quite touching. All of the above mentioned were fantastic by the way, though I would have liked to see more of the two gang leaders, Freeman and Kingsly.But, just like 'KKBB', I am a fan of this film because of its script. It is red hot, full of great one-liners and dark humour, with a few zingers of plot twisting to match. You are kept right up in your seat for the most part, though it is a little slow to start.The music is also a bit sparse, and the interiors are rather ugly, though this has probably something to do with the look of the film, in which case, it kind of works.Overall, if you're looking for a good mystery/comedy/thriller to rock your boat, and you enjoyed 'KKBB', then get this and thank me later.7/10",7,0,1,21 January 2007
Skyfall," Skyfall
","Bond is back. From the very first notes of the score to the last thrilling shot, the Bond franchise has made it through the murk of financial problems and, more importantly, the underwhelming and complicated 'Quantum Of Solace' to deliver a superb mission.That's not to say this is business as usual. Though old faces (human and vehicle) appear again after a notable absence, this is a film firmly set in two camps: Daniel Craig and Sam Mendes. The Craig Bond films have been and always will be gritty, dark, edgy affairs, the type to rival the competition of Bourne and other more realistic action films. With Mendes, the first Oscar winning director to helm a Bond film, we get perhaps the most beautiful looking Bond film there's ever been. A gorgeous looking neon set fight scene in China, for example, or the one long shot that heralds the arrival of the film's antagonist, Silva (a dazzling performance from another Oscar winner, Javier Bardem).This is a different kind of Bond film, one that may stand alongside 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' as a world apart from the usual Bond formula.Though the film starts with a thrilling pre-credits sequence involving cars, bikes, trains and cranes, the story is very character driven. An important piece of technology has been stolen containing names of undercover agents throughout the world; M's job and soon her very life is on the line. M is the Bond Woman in this film - driven, determined and at times ballsy, Judi Dench proves in her biggest role to date of the franchise just why she is the head of Mi6. Being a Mendes film, there are other suitably brilliant performances too from other British names - Ralph Fienes, Ben Whishaw and Naomi Harris, plus an excellent cameo from Albert Finney.The action, when it comes, is fast and furious, with as much work done for real as possible, something the Bond films should be commended for (and something that shows up when it isn't, case in point: 'Die Another Day'). The final third becomes a kind of mixture of Bond stripped of everything but the essentials, 'Home Alone' and 'Straw Dogs', a weird mix that actually works. When it's all over, you breathe a sigh of relief and, more importantly, you're already impatient for the next instalment.Though excellent, it's not perfect; despite having the best Bond theme for ages from Adele, the score by Thomas Newman is probably something that will grow with time. You miss the Barry-esque qualities that David Arnold brought to the series. As for the Bond theme itself, it feels slightly underused, though fills you with a guilty pleasure when it does kick in. The film could also arguably have been cut a little shorter, but the time really flew by when watching.Such a fantastic work and proof of Bond's hobby: 'Ressurection'.9/10",9,4,13,10 November 2012
Casablanca," 'You Must Remember This...'
","'...a kiss is just a kiss, a siiiiigh is just a sigh....' Ah, don't we just love 'Casablanca'? Is it not one of the best films of all time, perhaps even one of the greatest romances? The answer is, of course, yes. But why? Well, there are a number of factors to this. The first will be the story. 'Casablanca' has a fantastic script, filled with intelligence and quick dry wit. It is genuinely surprising as well, at least the first time you watch it. The twists and turns that Humphrey Bogart's character Rick goes through keep us on the edge of our seat.The second factor to the greatness will be the backdrop. The war, although only serving as just a backdrop, plays an incredibly important part in the story. Some people might argue that Rick's involvement in the plot signal's the need for America to enter the war. It also gives us our villain - that of Strasser (Conrad Veidt), the Nazi General sent to arrest Laszlo (Paul Henreid). Although this no doubt dates the film a little, it still provides a fantastic atmosphere. Casablanca itself is a seedy world of scum and villainy (That sounds familiar...) and the many characters that inhabit it bring it to life vividly, from the pickpocket to the street seller.The characters are the third reason why 'Casablanca' is remembered so well. Rick, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), and Laszlo get drawn into the love triangle easily. Bogart and Bergman are superb, as is Claude Rains as Louis Renault, the head of police there whose lines are great comic relief when we get into the nitty gritty of the romance.The one person we don't see enough of, I feel, is Sam (Dooley Wilson). For a character who seems to be regarded by Rick as a good friend, he disappears halfway through the film and is sold like slave labour along with the bar - one can only hope that he had a good rest of his life.The last and most important reason as to why this film is so good is the ending. It's one of the most famous endings of all time - it has a surprise twist, a wonderful score, and then tension builds up as Strasser arrives to stop the plane to Lisbon. The ending also supplies us with perhaps some of the most parodied lines in film history - I'll leave that up to you whether you think this is a good thing or not.By the way, although it is standard belief that no one ever says, 'Play it again, Sam', I reckon that Rick does when he whispers to Sam the second time Ilsa and Laszlo arrive at the bar. I have a feeling Sam would know what he was on about somehow...8/10",8,2,5,14 February 2006
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Forgetting Sarah Marshall
","When actress Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) dumps her long-term boyfriend Peter (Jason Segal), his world falls apart. Stuck in a horrible depression, he decides to go on vacation to Hawaii; unfortunately for him, Sarah also happens to be there with her new boyfriend, world famous rocker Aldous Snow (Russell Brand)...After the surprisingly charming 'Knocked Up' and the surprisingly gross-out 'Superbad', 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is a nice mixture of the two for the Judd Apatow crowd. It has a good, solid script, though the tendency for improvisation does become a little too regular at times. It also looks beautiful, a perfect picture postcard for Hawaii.If you have ever been dumped you can probably sympathise with Peter, played convincingly for the most part by Segal. However, at times the reliance on him being a bit of a cry baby does damage the character a little bit. What's nice, however, despite the initial finger of blame being pointed solely at Kristen Bell's Sarah, is that Peter too was at fault for the problems in the relationship. This makes the situation a lot more 3d and realistic.The two stars of the show are undoubtedly Mila Kunis as Peter's new love interest, Rachel, and Brand as Snow. While Kunis underplays and conveys the character that she is needed to be, Brand is a force unleashed, though thankfully he isn't let too far off the lead. His Snow is a wonderfully stereotypical and, in the end, monstrously pig-headed rocker; in a sense, Brand is really playing himself. It was always going to be a success.There is good supporting work from Jonah Hill and Paul Rudd as two dysfunctional hotel employees, though they do become a little annoying after a time. Bill Hader is much more successful as Peter's friend.Towards the end of the film the story attempts to go into clich√©s, and though it ends on a really big one, the blow is softened by the previous five minutes; the puppet musical of Dracula is laugh-out-loud funny, entirely reminiscent of the wonderful 'Avenue Q' in its brilliance and its audacity.At times one could argue that the film doesn't really know which audience it's aiming for: frat boy or genuine Rom-com lover? It is however a very decent effort, and should certainly not be forgotten in a hurry. We are waiting to hear about the movie rights to the Dracula Puppet Musical.7/10",7,0,2,2 January 2011
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Sweet! Yes! Yes!
","This movie TOTALLY ROCKS! It's one of the funniest i've seen in a long time, i must say, and it just shows how well a simple format such as 'South Park' can switch to the big screen! The plot 'aboot' the war between the USA and Canada is Bwa-ha-ha funny, and the idea of Saten, all powerful lord of hell, being gay is inspired. Plus the idea of the real bad guy being Sadamm Hussaine (gee, I hope I spelt that right!)- it's ingenious! The songs rock too, all the way from the 'Beauty and the beast' style opener, to 'Blame Canada' and of course the Les Miserables rip-off medley as well.favourite character? Cartman every time. his international version of 'Karl's Mum's a...' is wonderful and very funny.Criticism? Well, maybe the humour is a little too vulgar at times - the exploits of Cartman's mum, for example, but still this is 'Bigger, longer and Uncut!' 8/10",8,0,0,19 February 2005
Black Book," 'Black Book'
","I think I could probably count the number of foreign films I've seen out of my own choice on one hand. I am also not exactly the hugest fan of Paul Verhoeven. But there was so much hype surrounding this film, 'Black Book', that I just had to see it.I'm glad I did. This film brings back to memory the classic war spy films of the 40s, 50s and 60s, where brave men and women risked their lives against the Nazis for freedom. But the fact that it is based on real events creates a very sinister atmosphere to it, none more so than during the final third of the film, where history once again shoves a bitter blow to the face of 'peace lovers' by showing what happened to those poor men and women who fell in love with Nazi soldiers or sympathised with them.There are some excellent performances here, but although he seems to have come back with a bang, I just can't stick Verhoeven. It is now obvious after more than 20 years of his films where his interests lie - blonde women and violence. Just look at Sharon Stone in 'Basic Instinct', Denise Richards in 'Starship Troopers', even Elizabeth Berkley in 'Showgirls' - and now Carice van Houten. If this is the way in which Verhoeven is to become an auteur, I suppose you could argue that he is a sub-par Hitchcock, but then I shudder at the comparison.It's a shame, because this is a great movie, with plenty of twists and good historical background. You genuinely feel for Rachel/Ellis as life keeps dealing her with bitter blows. In the same instance, however, it does leave quite a few questions open - how does she get to Israel for a start? Ultimately, the theme is of violence once again - with the ending shot a rather pessimistic view of the rest of the 20th century.7/10",7,1,2,23 November 2007
Pirate Radio," 'The Boat That Rocked'
","It's 1966, and pirate radio is at its height, broadcasting the most amazing and up-to-date rock 'n' roll there is. On Radio Rock, 18-year old Carl (Tom Sturridge) is arriving to spend time with his godfather, Quentin (Bill Nighy) who runs the ship and the station. Carl's mother (Emma Thompson) thought it would set him on the straight and narrow. Silly Mum...There is a fundamental problem with 'The Boat That Rocked' and that is Richard Curtis. Despite the winning performances from some of his excellent cast and a soundtrack of legends to boot, it just doesn't seem to gel together. The story, perfectly sound at the start of it, seems to drift away and remains unresolved for the most part at the end.The stereotypes are all here: the loud American (a brilliant Phillip Seymoure Hoffman) and his British counterpart (a wasted Rhys Ifans); the breakfast DJ (an impressive Chris O'Dowd) who, in one of the film's many sub-plots, has his heart broken; the obnoxious prank-puller (Nick Frost, who is pretty unlikable for a lot of this movie); and the stuffy Government Minister intent on destroying Pirate Radio for good (Kenneth Brannagh, another actor not used to his full potential).The problem really lies in the writing and direction of Curtis. So many times during the film interesting story ideas are set up, some even played through a little bit, but never do we get a satisfying pay-off for any of them. Towards the end of the film it almost becomes clich√©d and unbelievable - a love interest of Carl's (Talulah Riley) who plays with his heart quite early on before jumping into bed with Nick Frost's character, returns in the last Act and, hooray, all is forgiven. A rather interesting sub-plot regarding the identity of Carl's father is given all but five minutes before a seemingly loving relationship has been set up.The final set-piece of the film, though spectacular, sadly betrays the problem with Curtis today. He used to be braver as a writer. In 'Four Weddings And A Funeral' (1994), arguably still his best work to date, he had the courage to kill off a crucial character suddenly halfway through the film. When Radio Rock starts to sink due to a massive engine failure, there are perfect chances to kill off several characters and tug at our heartstrings, thereby setting up what could have been a very satisfying end of revenge towards Branagh's character. And yet none of this is evident. The film ends all happy and feel-good, with a David Bowie song that, though excellent, is at least twenty years too late for the film's context.It's a shame that the film wasn't a little more realistic, or a little braver. Sadly, this seems to be the case with Curtis now. His success with 'Notting Hill' (1998) and, to a lesser extent, 'Love Actually' (2002) seems to have turned his scriptwriting into golden sugar-coated mulch. The less said about his directing, the better.A film that is too long and leaves too many loose ends unresolved, that also fails to mention the historical significance in the launch of stations such as Radio 1 in the downfall of pirate radio ships at that time, this boat sadly seems more like a dad dancing than actual rock, saved only by a few winning performances and a great soundtrack.6/10",6,1,1,25 September 2010
Finding Nemo," Mine! Mine! Mine!
","'Finding Nemo' is, quite simply, one of the most beautiful films you are ever likely to see. Next time you watch it, try this for an idea. Press your mute button and watch it without sound for a while, particularly the scene where Mr.Ray (Bob Peterson) takes all the little fish, including Nemo (Alexander Gould), through the coral reef towards the infamous drop off. It's still as enjoyable!The film starts off quite darkly, which is odd considering the nature of the rest of the film - quite light-hearted. It is, however, an essential part of the story, explaining how the fear of Marlin (Albert Brooks) towards the ocean came about, and also as a result the over-protectiveness he has over his son, Nemo.The storyline itself is pretty simple: Nemo gets captured by a scuba-diving dentist, Marlin swims off to rescue him. What helps the story is the many different and fantastic characters that he meets along the way to 'P Sherman, 42 Wallabe Way, Sydney'. This is of course where he meets the fantastic Dory (played here brilliantly by Ellen DeGeneres). Dory is quite possibly one of the funniest characters in a Pixar movie EVER. Her short-term memory loss is an inspired comedic characteristic that results in some great lines. For example:'It (the memory problem) runs in my family. At least I think it does. Hmm. Where are they? Can I help you?'There are other good characters in this story, though. there are the three friendly sharks, whose motto is 'Fish are friends, not food'. This proves to be their undoing, particularly Bruce's (Barry Humphries - you know, Dame Edna Everage?), resulting in a good chase sequence through a sunken submarine and mine field. We have the school of fish who enjoy making exciting 3d moving pictures (voiced singularly by John Ratzenberger, Pixar's lucky mascot). And of course you cannot forget the 'Righteous! Righteous!' sea turtles.Nemo meets interesting characters in the dentist's aquarium as well, including Gill (Willhelm Daefoe), who is constantly trying to get back into the ocean from whence he came. The rest are all pretty much bonkers - a cleanliness obsessed fish, a smelly blowfish, and a schizophrenic fish whose 'sister', Flo, appears every time she looks through the glass of the aquarium.Finally we have the non-swimming characters. The dentist is probably responsible for the scene where more people became scared of them then Laurence Olivier's performance in 'Marathon Man'. His removal of the tooth of the 'Prime Minister' is a great line that doesn't register first time around. This is probably because Nigel (Geforry Rush) has just crashed into the window. Very funny, and also a rather interestingly detailed knowledge of dentistry. Finally there is the movie's token 'villain' of sorts - Darla, the dentist's niece, and now famous for been associated with the 'Psycho' theme for young people.The movie is enjoyable every time you watch it. Throughout it we see the change in attitude towards the ocean in Marlin's behaviour and dialog, and Dory is always there beside him to provide yet another witty comment. (My girlfriend particularly likes the one about men asking for directions). It is also interesting to note that the final opponent to the success of this magnificent quest is humans themselves - in this case, fishermen. Just as in 'Bambi' with the hunter and his mother - sniff - we are portrayed as heartless predators who are tampering with the beauty of nature. The fact that there is no dialogue or anything at all characteristic about the two fishermen makes the anonymity of them even more sinister. Overall, a brilliant movie. Watch it. Watch it again. It rocks! And remember, 'just keep swimming, just keep swimming, just keep swimming, swimming, swimming, swimming...'9/10",8,3,6,4 March 2005
Hot Fuzz," Here Come The Fuzz
","Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright score another hit with this intelligent, funny and at times pretty thrilling follow up to their smash hit zom-rom-com 'Shaun Of The Dead', which I also loved. What was brilliant about that film was that it hit ticked every box it advertised: there was plenty of comedy, plenty of romance (be it between Saun and girlfriend or Saun and best mate), and plenty of zombies.Not sure how you could class this film - maybe an action-thriller-comedy-spoof-ensemble piece. Or not. But there was again plenty of every one of these.Great writing, great casting, great stunts and great special effects - basically the film is great. It sets a 'Lethal Weapon'-style movie in a small English town that just so happens to be full of A-list British actors like Jim Braodbent, Edward Woodwood and a brilliant Timothy Dalton. The boys have obviously gone up in the world budget wise after 'Shaun' - in the first scene alone we have Martin Freeman, Steve Coogan and Bill Nighy! The twists in the plot are slightly unexpected and very entertaining, and Pegg and Nick Frost once again make a great double act. My only criticism I have is that there were too many endings, kind of suffering from 'Return Of The King' syndrome there, but I guess that was needed to fully round up the spoof elements to the film.On the whole this is a genuinely funny film to watch with your mates (though not your Gran). Oh, and there's a couple of really good gory moments in it too. Well, what did you expect? These boys made a zombie movie! 8/10",8,0,0,21 January 2008
Pan's Labyrinth," 'El Laberinto Del Fauno'
","You've probably heard nothing but good things about this film, if you STILL haven't seen it yet. Well, until just a few short hours ago I was among the ranks with you, my friend. Not any more. Having received it on DVD for my birthday, I finally had time to settle down and see what all the fuss was about. And guess what? You ain't gonna get a negative review from me! This film is an absolute Must See! It's a dark, dark fairy tale for adults, set in the horrific brutalities of the end of the Spanish Civil War, yet somehow exquisitely jumping into a fantastic world of both beautiful and terrifying monsters. In either world nothing is what it seems, be it the cricket-type insect that transforms into a fairy, or the brutal captain who shows his true colours after Ofelia and her mother arrive at his base camp to live with him.Obviously, as you can tell from its certificate, this film is NOT for youngsters. There are some bloody torture scenes and plenty of gunshots to relay properly the horrors of fascism. As for the monsters, probably the most famous scene is with The Pale Man, a ghastly child eater whose eyes fit into slits in his hands. However, the title faun himself (who is never named as Pan in the film at all) can at times be a little creepy, particularly in his dirty old man attitude towards our heroine, Ofelia.All of Del Toro's trademarks as a director are here; this is a man clearly in love with monsters and mythical beasts, as one can see from other films of his such as 'Hellboy'. It is an absolute crying shame that this film was passed for an academy award for Best Foreign Film, but I think that it will still get the public vote every single time.8/10",8,0,2,5 June 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Burton's Epiphany
","Tim Burton has, despite his frequent insistence on his dislike for the genre, always been a director of musicals. You only need to look at the animated films of 'Corpse Bride' or 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' to see his unique take on show stopping numbers, and in his other films there are often moments of musical tomfoolery, such as in 'Charlie And The Chocolate Factory' or 'Mars Attacks!' The difference between these films and something like, say 'The Sound Of Music' is pretty obvious. Burton is a dark, Gothic auteur whose own brand of black comedy and love of ghoulish storytelling is now legendary in its own right.So 'Sweeney Todd' was perfect for him. In fact there is no other living film director who comes to mind who would have been as perfect a director of the film adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's perhaps most celebrated musical (though its more of a light opera than anything else - not in its subject matter, but in the amount of dialogue and songs). The actual show just oozes Burton in its horror story qualities, and you have the chance to bring more gore to the proceedings being much more up close and personal than in the theatre. Yet Buron never goes OTT with this gore, unlike some very unfortunate film franchises that are circulating today. It is INTENTIONAL gore, and though it may shock you when you first experience it (it comes in rather late into the movie) you quickly get over the surprise and begin to enjoy it in a rather unnerving way.There are other reasons for this other than Burton's handling. Depp and Bonham Carter are brilliant in their roles. Neither are strong singers, yet they perform their songs with such intensity it would be hard to believe they have not performed this on the stage themselves. Depp has added another memorable character to his vastly growing CV of kooks, and Bonham Carter's credibility has once again shot up above the Merchant Ivory costume dramas she was first discovered in. The supporting cast work very well too, though the love story between Todd's daughter and his sailor friend does suffer from the necessity of cutting for time. It helps that the music is extraordinary too. Though Sondheim has not been as successful in the UK as he has been in the States, its incredibly difficult to grasp just why this show was not more popular over here. The songs segue beautifully into each other , always with a dark undertone lurking somewhere, even in the lighter pieces (and there are one or two). A new production will no doubt be planned in the near future - and if not, why not? Burton has returned back to his roots after a few films that, though brilliant, were very family orientated. This is a film for grown ups, a fable for grown ups, and Burton does very well indeed with these fables. 8/10",8,0,1,14 October 2008
Corpse Bride," The 'Corpse Bride' lives!!!
","As a big fan of Tim Burton, it has been pleasing for me to see his work go from strength to strength in recent years, especially after the much-criticised 're-imagining' of 'Planet Of The Apes'. What's also pleasing is how much he can change his focus on when it comes to particular audiences. In the case of, say, 'Ed Wood', we have a mature adult audience against the family-based 'Charlie And The Chocolate Factory.' 'Corpse Bride' fits into the latter category like a well-fitting glove. Like 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' before it, 'Corpse Bride' is a wonderful stop-motion gem filled with Burton's typical grotesque characters and Gothic, dark and often very funny humour.The tale is fairly simple - Victor Van Dort is arranged to be married to Victoria, whose parents are grudgingly setting up for marriage because they are broke. Victor, being a quiet, timid sort of guy, is made worse by the fact that he falls in love with Victoria almost straight away, and so can't say his vows properly during the rehearsal. Practising with a few twigs in the woods, he inadvertently marries the Corpse Bride, who whisks him away to where she lives in the Land Of The Dead. Now not only does Victor have to try and escape, he also has to try to stop the villainous intentions of Barkis Bittern, whose ideas of marrying Victoria are not all that innocent...The animation is superb, no question about that. In fact it's refreshing to see, along with 'Wallace And Gromitt: Curse Of The Were-Rabbit', the return of stop-motion after a lengthy wait after the last masterpiece of this type of animation, 'Chicken Run', and before that 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' and the 'Wallace And Gromitt' shorts. In fact, it's nice to see Burton taking a risk with an art that is certainly considered dated in this modern-day age of Pixar and Dreamworks CGI films.The voice cast is outstanding - Johnny Depp as Victor gives his usual brilliant Johnny Depp best with an English accent that sounds like a quieter version of Ichabod Crane from 'Sleepy Hollow', another Burton film. Burton's other regulars are all here: Christopher Lee and Helena Bonham Carter, who gives a magnificent performance as the Corpse Bride with genuine feeling and emotion. The rest of the British cast - Joanna Lumley, Albert Finney as Victoria's parents, Tracy Ullman and Paul Whitehouse as Victor's, and Emily Watson as Victoria - all are wonderful. As is Richard E Grant as Bittern, though I do feel we don't see enough of him.The music is typical Danny Elfman - spell-bindingly beautiful and haunting. Like Tim Burton and animation, Tim Burton and Danny Elfman just connect so well. What I do feel was lacking was a few more songs, especially after the triumph of 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' which was, to a large extent, sung. Still the songs here are fairly good, though none are as catchy as the ones in 'Nightmare'. It's actually nice to hear both Paul Whitehouse and Helena Bonham Carter singing!In fact, and this is my real moan, I actually thought that the film was a little too short at 74 minutes. Although Burton was obviously going for the family audience, there are some Disney films which are longer than this. It left me wanting more, and where that is generally a good thing, I felt it rather negative for this film. There are also parts of the story which some little children won't understand exactly - they may find it a little scary as well, though Burton's dark humour is enough to make this fear diminish quickly.'Corpse Bride', despite it's length, is a wonderful film. Along with Aardman, Tim Burton has breathed new life into stop-motion animation. It didn't win the Oscar, but I knew it wouldn't - the flaw for the film was that it was released around the same time as 'Wallace And Gromitt', and as both were up for the Best Animation Oscar at the 2006 awards, I had a feeling that 'Wallace And Gromitt' will clinch it. A pity, because I do believe that this film would have very much been an Oscar winner.7/10",7,0,0,22 February 2006
Jarhead," 'Jarhead'
","'Jarhead' tells the true story of Anthony Swofford, played here by Jake Gyllenhall. Swofford was trained as a Marine, and in particular as a sniper. He went with other troops to fight in the first Gulf War, but in the end spent most of the time in the desert dying of boredom. When they eventually saw action it was for only a few days, and the frustrated Swofford never even shot anybody with his sniper rifle.This film is really very good in some places. There's a wonderful sense of black humour throughout, although at the beginning during the Boot Camp sequences it does get kind of 'Sgt. Bilko' in silliness.Things take a darker turn very suddenly when, during the training sequences later on,one of the soldiers-in-training panicked and ended up dead on barbed wire. This sets the pace for the rest of the film - moments of dark, twisted humour suddenly changed into shocking war images.To be honest, it can be argued that this is nothing new - there are moments of dark humour in 'Saving Private Ryan' for example, though you'd have to be incredibly morbid to find them laugh-out-loud funny - but Sam Mendes, the director, seems to set the tone well - we don't get too much humour, we don't get too much war imagery.The problem is finding a way of showing the boredom of the soldiers without boring the audience, and I think that Mendes does this well. As Swofford, Gyllenhall shows another side to his increasingly impressive calibre of acting - he's done teen, heartthrob, genius, gay cowboy, and now soldier - is there any part this guy can't play well? Gyllenhall is impressively supported by a number of good actors, particularly Jamie Foxx and Peter Sarsgarrd. The music, by Thomas Newman, is once again a successful collaboration between Newman's notes and Mendes' images.But there are a few problems. As with every war film, sentimentality enters in at some point, though thankfully not until near the end of the film. When it comes to the end of the film it also didn't seem to be a satisfactory ending to me. Sure, we saw what happened to the characters after returning from war, but can't we have a little bit more info? What does Troy (Sarsgarrd) die of for example? Finally, to me the most disappointing part of all in terms of music, we hear the sample from Kanye West's 'Jesus Walks', but where is Kanye over the end credits? That would have been a fitting end to the film.Despite these problems,I found 'Jarhead' to be an entertaining portrayal of one man's experiences of the reality of war - it's not always 'Apocolypse Now' after all. I think that others will be divided over this because there does not seem to be a clear stance on whether or not this film is anti-war or not. Personally, I don't think it matters. What matters is that this is a story about a man who goes to war - not a propaganda piece such as 'Farenheit 9/11'. It's up to the audience to judge whether or not this film is anti-war.8/10",8,1,2,24 May 2006
Ratatouille," Ratatouille
","Like all great artists, it was obvious that sooner or later Pixar would go through a bit of a rough patch when it came to their movies. From the giant first steps of 'Toy Story' over a decade ago, each of the films kept getting better and better, each showing new improvements to the animation process and this, in turn, helped the films become much more than Disney's computer generated films. When Disney themselves try their hands on these type of animation it is obvious whose is the more superior: Pixar.But sadly Pixar have had a fall - not a giant, catastrophic fall, as their 'masters' Disney, mind, but a fall none the less. 'Cars' was, in my opinion, surprisingly sub-par, a 6/10 effort. I hoped that 'Ratatouille', directed by Brad Bird, who created my favourite and I think best of all the Pixar films, 'The Incredibles', could pull Pixar back out of this rut.Sadly, this film is only slightly better than its predecessor. Though there are obviously some very clever minds at work on this story, it still seems a lot like a kid's movie rather than a family movie. That's not to say it was particularly bad - I enjoyed it a lot. But I guess I was expecting something more original than the classic 'don't look at the book's cover' morale.The visuals are great, as always, and there are some amazing characters in the film, particularly Anton Ego the food critic, played brilliantly by Peter O'Toole. Yet I was still left yearning for the scope of 'Finding Nemo' or the originality of 'The Incredibles' or the humour of 'Toy Story 2'. Good, but not great; a step in the right direction, though.7/10",7,2,3,13 July 2008
Quantum of Solace," Quantum Of Solace
","Almost immediately after the final scenes of 'Casino Royale' James Bond 007 (Daniel Craig) brings the shadowy Mr White (Jesper Christensen) to a secret location to be interrogated by M (Judi Dench). This triggers a global hunt for the members of a secret organisation, QUANTUM, and a key player, Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric). But Bond's mission is compromised by his own impulse for revenge, feelings which are mirrored by a young woman he encounters with Greene, Camile (Olga Kurylenko)...Credit where credit's due: 'Quantum Of Solace' starts fast and furiously and for the most part never lets up. With a typical Bondian car chase through the mountain roads of Italy leading into one of perhaps the most controversial Bond themes with its quick brass section, and into a short dialogue scene which leads into a chase across rooftops into another dialogue scene which leads into another fistfight which leads into another dialogue scene...you get the picture.The first direct sequel to a Bond film, 'Quantum Of Solace' does suffer slightly as I don't believe you can just watch it as a stand alone film - you definitely need to have seen 'Casino Royale' to understand what the heck's going on sometimes. The dialogue is, for the majority of the film, as fast and furious as the action scenes. You have to really pay attention to what everyone's saying or else you're left five minutes previously and still wondering why that guy was killed and who these people are, etc. This is why I watched it twice - and as a result I enjoyed it more the second time of watching as I understood more about what was going on.Usually enjoying a film more the second time you watch it means that it's a very good film. But 'Quantum Of Solace' seems to have become a real Marmite film - you're either gonna love it or you're gonna hate it. No point in laying the blame on Daniel Craig's shoulders. The best Bond since Connery and before Brosnan shattered his own legacy with the appalling 'Die Another Day', Craig's Bond takes the character to dark new places only hinted at by Dalton's brave but doomed two attempts. Showing little remorse at killing possible, helpful leads but softening when a friend is lying dying in his arms or a young woman mirrors his own sense of loss and anger at the death of loved one - truly, this is as close to Fleming's Bond that the screen incarnation will ever dare to get.The rest of the cast perform very well, in particular (and perhaps brilliantly) there is a tour de force performance by Judi Dench, whose M has evolved over the six films she has appeared in to be so much more than Bond's commander; infuriatingly she gets most of the film's best lines. Kudos to to Olga Kurylenko, whose Camille is possibly the most interesting Bond girl we've had in a while; however there is perhaps a danger that her character will be seen in later years as possibly more one-dimensional, especially when placing her next to Eva Green's superior Vesper from 'Casino Royale'. Mathieu Almaric does as well as he can in the villain role - though the diabolical, take-over-the-world plot that often accompanies the villains takes a large side-step for Bond's own personal mission of vengeance. Now that this storyline appears to be over, perhaps these will come back into the forefront.The film takes an interesting direction towards the final few scenes, however; it quietens, it slows. This is a Bond who has (aparently) come full circle, come to wake up to the reality of what he's doing, how he's living. This is no doubt thanks largely to the interesting choice of director, Marc Foster, whose work I have enjoyed very much but never really pictured him as a Bond director. Still he shows great skill in the action scenes and is very art-house-lite on the dialogue scenes.You can't call this film a return to form - thats what 'Casino Royale' was. Sadly, though, you can't really call this film a worthy continuation of the form. It is let down by its pace. Characters are wasted as a result, in particular Gemma Arterton's Agent Fields, who is probably the most stereotypical Bond character in the whole film, and thats saying a lot. It is also let down by its relationship with 'Casino Royale' - the ghost of Vesper haunts it mercilessly. But it's not as bad as some people suggest. It's a worthy addition to Craig's legacy, and hopefully will only be a slight dud when looked back in years to come, and not a great clunker as most of the Moore films seem to be. Good effort - just not great.7/10",7,1,4,20 December 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Fame Monsters
","There are perhaps few films in which the basic synopsis of the script can be summed up in the title. One thinks of lesser fare than this, certainly ('Zack And Miri Make A Porno', for example) or rather interesting Spanish translations of titles (classic 'Family Guy' joke here, top prize for whoever gets the reference first). With this film, the title does just that - it is about the assassination of the notorious Western criminal by one of his associates, Robert Ford, who ends up being defamed in the history books as a coward, and the time line leading up to the aforementioned event. Simple.But not quite, for, as with most great films, there is always something more, another message that the film is trying to say. And this is a great film. A really great film.Visually, it's stunning. The bleak Western landscape perfectly captures the mood of the story, with slight out of focus shots beautifully helping to add to the unhinged portrayal of the anti-hero James by Brad Pitt. This is one of those films where you suddenly remember that Pitt, the second half of 'Brangelina', can act occasionally. It's a fantastic performance, showing James as an out of control beast, but also with some very quiet melancholic foreboding, as if he knows he's living on borrowed time. It's matched, and perhaps even bettered, by a superb performance by Casey Affleck as Ford; Affleck is a dreamer, a man refusing to grow up, whose fantasies of riding with the James gang and being the criminal's best buddy seem to have corrupted his naive innocence. When the cold-blooded reality sinks in of the true nature of Jesse's work and Jesse's character, it becomes unbearable.There are other terrific performances in the film, not least from Sam Rockwell as Ford's older brother, whose own gullibility is soon swallowed up by fear, and a short but mesmerising turn from Garret Dillahunt as Ed Miller, whose paranoia costs him his life and lights the fuse for James' own fragile sense of trust to be shattered.The script is well paced, exploring the story like a history documentary with Hugh Ross' calm narration. There's no point in hiding the ending - the title's given it away already. Instead, the script is full of explanations, showing why Ford did what he did, and leaving it up to us to determine whether or not it was a good thing and whether or not he really was a 'coward', as suggested in the ballad sung by one of the film's co-composers, Nick Cave. He and Warren Ellis do a fine job with the score, leaving it subtle and calm, and adding to the quiet life out in the wilderness.Overall, the film is about fame and the hunger for fame. James is famous for his notoriety, a man who, like the characters played by Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis in 'Natural Born Killers', becomes famous for all the wrong reasons. Ford wants the same kind of fame, but when he gets it in the aftermath of his role in James' death, he finds it stifling and unsatisfying, and over far too quickly; the fame of a coward does not last as long as the fame of a 'hero'. And so the film speaks volumes for us today, in this age where we've lived through the last decade as the Decade of 15 Minutes, the decade where anyone and everyone can be famous for as long as Ford was, and can still find it as he does.A fantastic film.8/10",8,1,2,19 January 2010
Batman Begins," A brilliant film, but one or two minor problems
","'Batman Begins' truly is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time, and is almost certainly one of the best superhero movies to come out since 'Spider-Man'. It's another smash movie for director Christopher Nolan, whose 'Insomnia' is one of the greatest Hollywood re-makes from the beginning of the decade. And as for the title role, Christian Bale proves that an 'American Psycho' is almost perfect casting for one of America's most psychologically troubled comic book heroes.The story is simple enough - all of us who know the Batman legend know it fairly well. A young Bruce Wayne sees his parents murdered and the after-effects are the cause for the birth of the Bat. But this film also delves deeper into how he became the tough fighter he is. We must always remember with batman that he is NOT a SUPER hero: he does not have the legendary powers of his counterparts, like Superman, the X-Men, or even Spidey. What he has is strength, and a bloody good left hook and all.So the first third of the film is rather reminiscent of the Asian kung-fu films we are beginning to see more and more of in the West, as Wayne trains with the League of Shadows, it's mysterious leader Ras's Al-Ghul (Ken Wattanbe) and his number two, Emile Ducard (Liam Neeson). Wayne brings the house down on the League, however, and journeys back to Gotham. The second third of the film is largely dominated by how Bruce turns himself into Batman, using the realistic weapons and body armour supplied by Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman). The third part of the film is the first real adventures that Batman faces, and there are some real humdingers in terms of twists in this part of the film.There are, however, as with nearly all other Batman films, a few tiny drawbacks.The bad guys are fantastic - I've got nothing against Tom Wilkinson's Falcone, and as for Cillian Murphey's Scarecrow, it just proves that nobody does a Hollywood blockbuster baddie quite like us British! But I do feel that we did not see enough of Murphy in the film for him to be able to do justice to such an interesting character as the Scarecrow. Obviously this is cleared up at the end when we discover who the true enemy is, but I still think that Murphy's character, though brilliant in performance, does not exactly pose much of a threat to Batman.This film also presents a problem in terms of the other four Batman movies. Now, I personally did not like 'Batman & Robin', but I feel there ought to be some continuity. As a big Tim Burton fan, I have an uneasy feeling that if a certain character is re-introduced into the new series of films, as is hinted at the end of the movie, then Burton's efforts will be wiped clean off the slate, and they will become just another version of the Batman legacy. Also, I feel personally that nobody grins like Jack! Still, besides these few minor points, the film is very enjoyable, and also very dark in some places, which I feel is the right idea for the Batman franchise. as I have mentioned before, Batman is not actually the most super of heroes. His is a dark, mysterious story that, compared to 'Superman', makes the X-Men look like the Tellytubbys! It is perfect film noir, and I am glad that Nolan has captured that feeling in the film. There is very little light in it at all, which helps give Gotham the Gothic atmosphere it requires.I have already mentioned the brilliant performances of Bale and Murphy, and I must not forget to mention Gary Oldman's Jim Gordon, who provides some very funny lines throughout all the darkness of it all. There is also Katie Holmes who, although not on the screen a lot of the time, does give her character a certain Gothamesque quality. I liked what happened between her character and Bale's Wayne at the end of the film because this is exactly how I feel Batman should be with his love interests. But Michael Caine's Alfred is super, without question. Although I enjoyed Michael Gough in the last four films, I think that Caine has made the part of Alfred his own. He seems to be enjoying it immensely, and is someone who I feel would work well in a bigger storyline for him.I read in another review that this film does for Batman what 'GoldenEye' did for Bond, and I cannot agree more. This has wiped away all traces of 'Batman & Robin' and nipple-accustomed bat suits off of the wall and come crashing through with a fantastic movie. I cannot wait for the sequel.By the way, if Nolan is reading this, I do a very good grin and my laughter can be as high-pitched and as scary as you want it. Just a thought...8/10",8,1,2,30 June 2005
The Incredibles," That was Totally Wicked!
","The secret Identity of SPOILERS may be revealed in this review! I wasn't too sure about this film when my girlfriend and i went to see this. In my mind, nothing could top the beauty and splendid magnificence of the film that was 'Finding Nemo', especially visually.I was wrong to be worried. This film ROCKS! I went to see it again in the cinema and recommend it to you for your list for must have DVDs. The story is excellent, the sly jokes are very good, and the music - v. Bondian - perfectly fits the mood of the film; a darker, more adult Pixar movie. That been said, I was probably the oldest member of the audience both times - I was 17 - and yet they still clapped and cheered. Proof that any age can enjoy this movie.Craig T Nelson and Holly Hunter are great in the leads, and Jason Lee is very good as the bad guy.I love the part about villains monologuing, by the way, because it's so true! Just watch any Bond film - a good one for an example of this is 'Tomorrow Never Dies'.Faults? One or two. Visually it's very impressive, but is a very different film to 'Finding Nemo' - I suppose that could be the counter-argument. Oh, and the Pixar short before the film SUCKED! C'mon, Pixar, it was totally against the mood of the main movie. What went wrong there? Apart from that, no complaints! A superb film from Pixar.9/10",8,0,1,7 January 2005
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Great!
","Just a short review this time, but there still maybe SPOILERS within it.I'm a big fan of Tim Burton, and TNBC is no exception. It is one of the best animated features I have seen in a long time. The score by Danny Elfman truly is magnificent. The characters are all unique and individual, plus the sets and lighting works wonders too. Yes, the story is a little weak, and perhaps the songs are a little too random, but these are all wiped out of consideration by the sheer wonder of this movie! (By the way, I'm a particular fan of Sally's Song, probably because the tune is repeated so many times!)8/10",9,1,2,16 December 2004
Brave," Brave
","Princess Merida (Kelly Macdonald) lives in Medieval Scotland with her royal parents (Emma Thompson and Billy Connolly). From an early age she has preferred a bow and arrow to polite manners and proper princess conduct. Her mother, however, has other ideas, and arranges a competition for the other clans first borns to win her hand. Mother and daughter are now set against each other, but when Merida tries to use magic to change her fate, the two of them end up having to work together before everything changes...The Pixar canon has more times then not produced stunning films; not only are the visuals impressive, the story and the script is on the same level. Unlike their rivals at Dreamworks and Fox, they are also very careful to not sell a film just on the stars that are playing the characters. A classic example: how many more people went to see 'Kung Fu Panda' because Jack Black was in it? However, there have been occasions where the films just haven't met the high standards set by their greatest works,examples off which include 'Wall-E', 'Up', 'Finding Nemo', 'The Incredibles' and, of course, the 'Toy Story Trilogy'. The lesser films, though occasional blips, stick out like sore thumbs in the otherwise impressive history.Sadly, 'Brave' is in this category. That's not to say it isn't any good; it's a lot better than a lot of films out at the moment and a lot of animation that has been out over the last year. The concept of having a film set entirely in Medieval Scotland is a risky one for certain, particularly when you consider the international market and the US cinemas.The visuals are stunning, though - Scotland's wild Highland countryside is perfectly captured by the Pixar geniuses; cloth, water and fur are all wonderfully created to the quality we have come to expect. The almost entirely Scottish cast, ably led by Kelly Macdonald as Princess Merida, are very good, if a little uninspiring, particularly when you have Billy Connolly in the credits.But the story lets the film down. After an impressive opening, the film becomes a kind of lacklustre cousin to the dire Disney film 'Brother Bear', one of the films in the early 2000s that put a death knell on the classic Disney giant status. There is also a significant lack of any proper villain in the film. Julie Walters, as a witch, is potentially wasted as an antagonist, which is left to a demon bear who, while scary enough for little people, just doesn't have the same effect as Lotso Bear or Syndrome.This however is from a grown man's point of view; having watched it in a cinema full of little people who throughly enjoyed it from the gasps and cheers and laughs, one can definitely say that this is the best Pixar kids film the studio has made for some time. But the joy of Pixar's greatest hits is that you can watch them whatever age and find something in them for you. Although the film's visuals are certainly captivating, there is very little else for grown ups here.7/10",7,0,0,30 August 2012
The Piano," Quite good.
","'The Piano' is one of those films that becomes famous for one aspect and not so famous for the other. In the case of this film, it's the music - that beautiful score with that familiar piano tune we've heard on so many compilation CDs, TV programmes, adverts, etc.So it was interesting to see what the story behind the music was all about. Holly Hunter is quite good, though not wonderful, as Ada, the mute who, along with her daughter, is sent to New Zealand to meet her new husband through arranged marriage.What got me about this film was that it was all about the piano - obviously. But there were times when I didn't really like Ada as a character - she seemed like a spoilt little child at times, acting worse than her daughter when she didn't get her way about the piano.Thank goodness for Harvey Keitel and Sam Neil. They, along with the music, saved this film for me, with very good performances that seemed quite out of character, actually. After all, we are more used to Keitel being the rough and tough 'Resevoir Dogs' guy, aren't we? So, overall, quite good, but not as good as some will let you think.6/10",6,2,6,16 November 2005
The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight
","It is after the events of 'Batman Begins'. An anarchic terrorist known only as the Joker (Heath Ledger) is creating havoc in the streets of Gotham City. The people are divided between how they should feel about the masked vigilante patrolling the streets(Christian Bale). And new district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhardt) is busy making promises that may not be easy to keep...First off, wow. Simply wow. From the very first moment, this film catches your attention and holds it for as long as possible. It shocks you, it amuses you, it horrifies you, it thrills you. And it is truly the work of a genius. For that is what the film is full of, both in front and behind of the camera. Christopher Nolan, who just keeps rolling in hit after hit, does not disappoint.Woe betide him when he makes that slip-up that can only happen soon, because it will be a major slip-up when viewed alongside films of this calibre.One thing 'The Dark Knight' is not, however, a fun film. It is not even a funny film, though there are one or two chuckles. Even if you have seen 'Batman Begins', you may still be surprised at how dark this film actually is. There is an air of gloom and bleakness to the whole event, much more so than its predecessor, which was perhaps darker than even Tim Burton's original visions ('Batman', 1989,and the superior 'Batman Returns', 1992). But this picture takes darkness to a whole new level.This is partly due to the story and to the nature of its characters; Batman has always been the most psychological of all comic book characters, and the most realistic. Just as before, Nolan takes that realism and uses it to help the bleakness, the air of despair that hovers around the film.There are of course other reasons besides the plot. Firstly, you cannot help but watch this film without remembering the death of Heath Ledger. This is not as morbid as you might think; it's just that he's SO GOOD in the role. Completely unrecognisable under the makeshift make up, with a brilliantly nasal voice and vicious laugh, he wipes the slate clean. Although Jack Nicholon's portrayal of the same character in Burton's original was good, this is a completely different take on the character - again, a more realistic feel to him. And you cannot help feeling how Ledger's death was such a waste of talent, especially after watching his performance here.The other factor to mention briefly is the presence of Harvey Dent. Though brilliantly portrayed by Aaron Eckhardt, his performance is armed by the fact that we all know what is going to happen next: the acid related accident, the snapping of the already weak mind, the emergence of Two-Face. A much better and and more fulfilling take on the role than that of Tommy Lee Jones' fair attempt in 'Batman Forever' (Schumacher, 1995), you leave the film wishing to have seen a lot more of him, but grateful for the chance to have witnessed him at all, and the make up is superb.All the other performers in this are, of course magnificent; Bale is at his brooding best as the caped crusader, and the three wise men of Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine all reprise their previous roles without breaking a sweat. The re-casting of Rachel Dawes from Katie Holmes into Maggie Gyllenhall does upset the balance a little, not because of her performance but because, again, there is not enough time spent with her for us to warm to her being this character.My other criticism - and it's a little criticism, mind - is that the film is a tad too long, and towards the end you've had at least one stage where you could have arguably ended the film altogether much earlier. For the most part, however, 'The Dark Knight' does not disappoint. With a few surprises, and some loose ends both on and off the camera still to be tied up, you will literally be gagging for (hopefully) the next instalment. Brilliant.9/10",9,2,6,25 July 2008
Pulp Fiction," 'Pulp Fiction'
","Given the opportunity to get this on a cheap DVD, I decided to seize the day as it were and find out what all the fuss was about. Having only seen one Tarantino film - 'Kill Bill: Part One', which I suppose actually means I'd only seen half a Taraniton film - and having enjoyed it a lot, plus having read and heard all the hype surrounding 'Pulp Fiction', my expectations were higher than I would say they usually are before watching a film.For the majority of it, 'Pulp Fiction' does exactly what I've been led to believe it does: confuses you and thrills you, as well as making you chuckle, albeit a little guiltily, at several points.The story itself - not told in a linear style - can at times be frustratingly annoying in its light-pretentious way of saying, 'Ooh, look at me, I'm non-linear, I'm going to muck about with your heads'. It is also full of coincidences, especially the story which revolves around Bruce Willis's character. This particular strand goes off into extremely weird territory. I suppose parts of it could happen, but you'd have to be very, very unlucky for it to actually be the case.The cast are pretty much impeccable. Despite the very good performance of John Travolta, the film's early scenes really belong to Samuel L Jackson, whose rehearsed Biblical scripture sounds at first rather absurd before becoming incredibly chilling. There are nice turns from Uma Thurman and Ving Rhames before the film is once again saved by Jackson. Harvey Keitel is also bwa-ha-ha funny, thankfully good enough to overshadow the rather poor performance of Tarantino himself.One thing that does rock in this film is the soundtrack, from the opening familiar theme which suddenly changes halfway through into a completely different piece of music, to the final end guitar strains. The stand-out piece must be the Chuck Barry song which Travolta and Thurman dance the twist rather badly to. This is a moment so surreal that you're not sure whether to laugh or just scratch your head and ponder the meaning of life.On the whole, 'Pulp Fiction' deserves most of the plaudits it has gained, and it is (or was) original enough to justify winning the Palme D'Or at Cannes 1995. But it is not a really great film. I have a feeling that we're still waiting for Tarantino to make one of those. Unless he already has, and I just haven't watched it yet.7/10",7,1,2,6 November 2007
Les Mis√©rables," Les Miserables
","France, 1800s. Convict Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) breaks parole after been given a second chance by a kindly bishop (Colm Wilkinson). Pursued by the police inspector Javert (Russel Crowe),Valjean tries to become a better man, adopting the daughter of a factory worker (Anne Hathaway) in the process. But revolution is in the air...Within the first few minutes of Tom Hooper's film you realise this is no ordinary adaptation of a musical; the ships being pulled into harbour by the convicts under stormy skies, Crowe's obsessive inspector overseeing the action; the music dark and foreboding. This is a film that is not afraid to shy away from the poverty, from the violence. You feel every bullet, you can almost smell the sewage that Jackman must crawl through during the third act.Jackman is extraordinary, and with the amount of vocals he must perform, not to mention the range he sometimes must sing ('Bring Him Home' an obvious example), you feel as if he has to be. His emotional journey of confliction and guilt is well judged and balanced, though for a film that supposedly covers at least twenty five years he ages remarkably well. He is matched by a fantastic talented cast; Crowe, to be blunt, is not a natural singer but his performance in fact helps the film even more, for Hooper chooses to shoot his solos in intense close up and as a result he is brooding and menacing.Hooper uses this trick quite a few times, most notably during 'I Dreamed A Dream', which is one long unbroken shot. Anne Hathaway is extraordinary; she neither showboats nor shies away from the power of the song or the emotion of the character, who has been brought to her lowest by the cruelty of those around her. It is a great, awards worthy performance, and is actually missed when she is no longer around after the first act.The film isn't all doom and gloom and depression, despite its title; there is welcome comic relief from Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the thieving innkeepers, and a charming, sweet love section with Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne; this also involves a bewitching turn from Samantha Barks, the only member of the cast to have played their character on stage; as a result she knows her role inside out and adds a raw emotion to it.The film isn't perfect, sadly; it is perhaps a little too long, though fans of the stage show will notice when songs have been trimmed slightly and reworked. But all in all, it is a fantastic achievement. The last great movie musical, arguably, was Chicago, in that it found a way to convey the song and dance numbers in a believable, celluloid sense. Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd is of course a worthy contender, with it's love of blood and gore helping it to stand out from the crowd; but Hooper has done the seemingly impossible and made a gorgeous film out of a show that has often been criticised for its overuse of schmaltz; this is grounded, and more to the point, realistic. It is first class filmmaking.8/10",8,3,6,3 February 2013
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The Goblet of Fire burns, but not as hot as I'd like...
","The fourth Harry Potter film, 'The Goblet of Fire', was probably hoping to breath a sigh of relief this year. After all, no Tolkein to compete with, so all the fantasy buffs must surly come to this movie, right? Well, things have changed, as Hermione (Emma Watson) points out. CGI is no longer new, it can be seen in virtually every movie. So a film director, when choosing CGI, must decide whether or not to put more emphasis on it, to compete with the special effects of Tolkien's Secret Son Peter Jackson and his film 'King Kong' or to put emphasis on the story, and compete with the allegorical story lines of Tolein wanna-be 'The Lion,The Witch and The Wardrobe.' Here, Mike Newell, the third director for the franchise, has opted to try for both. Unfortunately, this does not work all of the time. There are a number of problems with this method.Firstly, the original source. God bless JK Rowling for bringing books back to kids and all, but I feel sorry for the poor scriptwriter of this film. The book is so large and so full of essential plot devices that to truly do it justice you would probably have to make an eight hour long film. (Don't get any ideas, Jackson). Secondly, when the CGI really starts to work, it quickly becomes overlong and boring. Gone are the realistic touches from 'Prisoner of Azkaban', probably the best so far of the series, and in goes effect after effect after effect. The dragon scene is a prime example, extended merely to try and add a bit of exciting CGI into the film - here we see the 'King Kong' competition.The cast try their best. From the welcome surprise of finding Eric Sykes and Jarvis Cocker making brief appearances, to the regular cast of Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane, we truly have the best of British. Michael Gambon's Dumbledore is a somewhat darker character than previous, but then this is a darker movie. Only Gary Oldman disappoints - well, HE doesn't, but his limited screen appearance does. As for Ralph Feinnes, I reckon Nicole Kidman nicked his nose for 'The Hours'...Of the kids, it's wonderful to see the Fred and George roles expanded so to add much needed comic relief into this darkest of Potter movies. The usual three - Radcliffe, Grint and Watson - do their usual roles -hero, comic sidekick, brainy sidekick - as well as usual, though I'm still not a great fan of Harry Potter himself, Radcliffe.I think the main problem with this movie is the script. Because of the amount of stuff in the book, they've tried to get it all in, spoiling what could have been fascinating character development, as was done in the third film. We see no Quidditch action, Miranda Richardson's Reeter Skeeter is wasted, and even David Tennant's superb Barty Crouch Jr doesn't seem to have the same kind of twisted evil that the character in the book does.The fourth film shows a change, not just in our three heroes and the development of the story, but also in the films themselves. I fear that, as the next two books are the same length as the fourth one, and indeed the last one will probably be as well, the films are going to stay on this level forever - full of delights, but with a sense of been crammed into a box.7/10",7,0,0,5 January 2006
The Fountain," 'The Fountain'
","I like to think of myself as a fairly universal film viewer, in that I watch both mainstream and art house films. Personally I don't really like the fact that there is such a thing as art house cinema ¬ñ films are for everyone, and we should all be given the chance to watch them, whatever their subject matter, country of origin, etc. Thank goodness, then, for DVDs, or else I know I probably would have had to wait a very long time before seeing 'The Fountain'.This film totally staggered me. I knew I was in for a wild ride in a technological sense, and I wasn't proved wrong. The visual effects, particularly those set in the 'future/inner self' segments of the film are awesome to watch and beautiful. But this film has a hell of a lot of emotion in it too, and I wasn't expecting to be taken on a wild ride inwards.I guess it's kind of difficult to work out the exact synopsis ¬ñ Aronofsky gives the plot just enough ambiguity for everyone to have their own opinion on what exactly is going on. It all revolves around the characters of Tommy and Izzie, played respectively by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. Izzie is sick, dying of a brain tumour, and Tommy has made it his mission to find a cure for it and save her life. Izzie, meanwhile, spends her time writing a manuscript for a novel about a Spanish conquistador who is sent on a seemingly impossible expedition by his love, the Queen of Spain ¬ñ again, both of these characters played by Jackman and Weisz.This film is a real tour de force for both these actors, and Weisz is fast becoming one of my top five favourite actresses who make films watchable simply because they are in them. Thankfully, this doesn't have to be the case with 'The Fountain'. Jackman is probably the stand out performance here, however, his character (or characters) going through a wide range of emotions and journeys whose endings, though perhaps are sometimes predictable, are not tedious in their predictability.Several images repeat themselves through the film; for example a ring, skin, and, perhaps most important of all, a tree. Not just any tree, mark you, but the Tree of Life, the perhaps less famous one from the book of genesis in the Bible, the one whose slightly overshadowed by the big bad Tree of Knowledge. If anything, this film made me actually see for the first time what several of the sentences mean in this segment of the biblical text, words that I and I'm sure a lot of others would have simply blanked over.I urge you to see this film. I know it won't be everybody's cup of tea ¬ñ after all, that's why it's not mainstream. It's intellectual, has a confusing plot line, only has two major stars in it, and it's director's last film was 'Requiem For A Dream', another flick which divided film goers and critics alike. But it's also about grief, about love and hope and of acceptance. This would be a great therapy film for those going through a terminal illness, or for those who have recently lost someone in that way. It is a beautiful, beautiful film, and the first chance that you get, please, watch it.9/10",9,1,3,10 January 2008
Inception," Inception
","Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are thieves of a very special kind. They can journey into a person's dream and steal secrets from their mind whilst their target sleeps. The reversal of this technique, the Inception - whereby you plant an idea so far into a person's psyche they believe it was their own creation - is thought to be near impossible. But when Cobb is offered a chance to finally go home, the task becomes more tempting...'Inception' proves beyond a doubt that one of the greatest living film directors of our age is Christopher Nolan. Very rarely in his movies does he seem to put a foot wrong, from 'Memento' (2000) through one of my personal favourites, 'Insomnia' (2002) and the first two films of his Batman trilogy. With 'Inception' we also have the proof that, if you give an outstanding filmmaker a seemingly unlimited budget, wonderful things can happen.You really, really have to pay attention in this film - when you do you are rewarded tenfold; for length, talky psychological conversations about dreams and our own minds are counter-balanced deliciously by brilliantly shot action set-pieces, be they city car chases in the rain or a Bond-esquire snow covered mountain espionage shoot-'em-up. Towards the end of the film these do seem slightly stretched, but it is to Nolan's credit that they are quickly redeemed by intelligent scriptwriting and brilliant performances.Though he may be the headline act, DiCaprio is nowhere without his crew. He plays the emotionally compromised Cobb wonderfully, his own sanity and the safety of his team endangered by his obsession with his dead wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who is arguably the villain of the piece. But at times his performance seems workmanlike - these are the kinds of roles we know he can play and play them well. It's time perhaps to see something more dangerous, the DiCaprio we witness in 'Blood Diamond' (2006) for example.Thankfully, this truly seems a team effort, for the different members of his team are given plenty to do. As well as Gordon-Levitt's no-nonsense right hand man, there's a brilliant scene-stealing performance from Tom Hardy, gaining a lot of laughs as Eames the 'forger'. Ellen Page is given another satisfying role for her talents, though perhaps stands out a little more than the others due to her mainly indie credentials. Time will tell to see if these are the type of films she should be performing in.The special effects and stunt work are extraordinary. One scene in particular, where Gordon-Levitt has to navigate around a hotel corridor floating in mid-air, is believably achieved as well as the weightless scenes in 'Apollo 13' (1995) for example. The music, a thundering score by Hans Zimmer, works well with the images, as does a surprising inclusion of a Edith Piaf classic.You aren't really aware of how much time you've spent watching this film until right near the end, during the aforementioned moments where you half-wonder if the film is ever going to reach a conclusion at all. This is something of a trend of Nolan's films - brilliant as they are, they never quite seem to know when to end exactly. When 'Inception' does finish, however, it comes with a delicious moment of teasing, leaving the audience gasping, laughing or expelling with frustration, and more than making up for this slight blip.'Inception' is probably one of the best films you will see this summer. What makes it even more amazing is that, once more, Nolan has delivered an intelligent blockbuster to cinema screens, just as he did with 'The Dark Knight' (2008). His next film is reported to be the final part of his Batman trilogy; though to be perfectly honest, it could just as well be a small low-budget indie rom-com - this reviewer would still look forward to it with immense anticipation. Great stuff.8/10",8,2,6,11 August 2010
WALL¬∑E," Wall.E
","Wall-E is a helpful trash bot, one out of many who are assigned to clean up Planet Earth in the future when the human population has made too much mess and had to evacuate. Now he is the only robot left on the planet, and his loneliness has forced him to create a personality of his own. Then a mysterious spaceship arrives and with it a sleek vision named Eve...Thank god Pixar have got back on track. After the surprise dullness of 'Cars' and the almost-good-but-not-quite-there of 'Ratatouille', everything was riding on 'Wall-E' if you were a Pixar fan, and there was no disappointment at all. This is probably one of the most beautiful looking, touching films that was released throughout 2008, and definitely the best looking Pixar film of the bunch.The answer to this is Andrew Stanton, the genius behind that other beautiful looking film, 'Finding Nemo'. Stanton understands the importance of colour, of spectacle, whilst never giving up the fundamental idea of story. Unlike 'Nemo' and its multi-cast of hundreds, for the first forty minutes you only ever see three characters - Wall-E, Eve and a cockroach. With every minute of this opener the film is in danger of becoming tedious due to this, and yet wonderfully, absurdly, it never gets boring for a minute.Now this is obviously my opinion, a man who sat through 'The Age Of Innocence' and thought it wasn't too bad. Unlike most of Pixar's films this is not one for the very young - not because its scary or not suitable, far from it, but because they WILL get bored easily throughout the beginning. When we journey off of Earth, out into space and finally meet some humans (and finally hear some dialogue), then interest may be sparked again - for everyone else its a joyous experience.This film also forever portrays the difference between Pixar films and other computer animated works. The latter always, always, ALWAYS rely on top name celebrity voices to sell their films, no matter how good the films are, you will always hear in the trailer who is in it. Pixar never do this - even with 'Cars' where Owen Wilson was in it there was still no mention of his name. The reason? Pixar don't need to pull this trick, especially when they're making films of THIS calibre. There are no famous voices in 'Wall-E', save for an almost unrecognisable Sigourney Weaver who has a few lines as a computer and Pixar's good luck charm John Ratzenberger.This is a very brave film to pull off and only Pixar (with maybe the exception of Aardman Animations) could do it and do it as brilliantly. There is so much sentiment in the story, with the romance that develops between the two robots so sweet and believable, more so than any human romance story I've seen since 'When Harry Met Sally'. Pixar are right back on top, where they deserve to be. Thank goodness - for a moment I was getting worried.8/10",8,2,5,22 December 2008
The Good Shepherd," The Good Shepherd
","When an actor with a reputation as huge as Robert De Nero steps behind the camera, you expect big things. After all this is an actor who has been constantly named as one of the greatest of his generation, second only to Al Pacino - if anyone should know how to make a powerful, hard-hitting movie, it should be De Nero.For most of the duration of the film, 'The Good Sherpherd' does not disappoint. First of all, its subject matter - the genesis and development of the CiA - is actually pretty interesting. The film tries to pass itself off as a spy thriller, but its really more of a biography of one of the most famous security organisations in the world.There are some excellent performances in this film too, but sadly they don't seem to belong to any of the headline actors. De Nero does a good job in a small cameo which you want to have more of, as you do John Turturro in his 'personal assistant' role. On the British end Michael Gambon is great as usual, and John Sessions does an brilliant job as a Russian defector, and it was a bit of a surprise to see him in a film like this. Perhaps the biggest waste here is the fact that the legendary Joe Pesci's role is laughably minuscule, yet he still completely out acts Matt Damon.Damon isn't bad in this film, but I have an unfortunate problem in watching him with his glasses on, because I instantly think of 'The Talented Mr Ripley'. You also get pangs for Damon's other great spy character, Jason Bourne, but I think thats because of the mislabelling of the film as a thriller. Angleina Jolie is reduced to playing a very, very annoying character, and that annoyance factor seems to be passed on down the family line to their son, who REALLY got on my nerves for some reason.Another problem with the film is the length of it. Sometimes a long film works and sometimes it doesn't. This was a sort of mix between the two. Most of the time you enjoy the film, yet there are occasions where you look at your watch and think 'How much longer are we going to stay with this scene?' On the whole, if you know what you're letting yourself in for - subject matter, length, etc - then you should enjoy this film. Otherwise you may be very disappointed.7/10",7,1,2,19 May 2008
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Rises
","To relaunch a well loved story and do it right is an immense task. To carry the story on and make an even better film in the progress is monumental. To finish that story and do it right is akin to climbing Mount Everest by hopping on one leg.With 'The Dark Knight Trilogy', Christopher Nolan has done all this and more. He has cemented his place in the history books by creating a franchise of intelligent comic book films, adding them to his rostra of intellectual blockbusters. Most importantly, with 'The Dark Knight Rises', Nolan has once again made an excellent film to add to an extraordinary canon: 'Memento', 'Insomnia', 'Batman Begins', 'The Prestige', 'The Dark Knight', 'Inception'. He is the rightful owner to the title of Greatest Film Maker of the moment; a modern day Scorcese with a traditionally epic view of films such as DeMille would have been proud of.This is not to say that there aren't problems with the film; the script, though keeping you guessing throughout most of the plot, is let down but not in a traditional sense. More, it is the mythology of the Batman story that hinders it. Such was the problem with the introduction of Harvey Dent in 'The Dark Knight'; knowing the story of this tragic character automatically overshadowed him with the spectre of Two Face. Yet Nolan used this to his advantage, making sure the audience weren't treated like idiots because of it, and making the excellent choice to give the Joker no back story whatsoever to counter-balance this. In 'The Dark Knight Rises', if you know the mythology, then a few characters appearance will be more obvious than others.Despite this, once again the story is treated as realistically as if it was a modern-day thriller. Batman as a character is perhaps (at a stretch) one of the most believable comic book heroes; he has no super powers, he is spurred on by his own tragedy, his own darkness. The characters around him, particularly the villains, are influenced and inspired by this darkness; some for good - an aspiring, perhaps slightly naive police officer played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt is excellent support, and Gary Oldman is once again great as Comissioner Gordon.The ones whose motives are less than desirable are also treated with great care and attention. Tom Hardy's Bane has come under a lot of scrutiny due to the mask the actor wears, but more of his dialogue can be heard clearly than previously reported. Besides, one COULD be cynical and suggest that this is another ploy by Nolan to get you to come and watch the film again just to try and catch every sentence, but that's probably going too far. Hardy gives an unusually restrained performance as this psychopath, his accent unclear as to where he exactly comes from, but a brutal, brooding force who is determined to reach his goal, whatever the cost.For myself, however, there are three stand out performances; Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, who we KNOW is Catwoman yet is never defined as such, gives a sensual, streetwise kick to the character and should play this kind of character more often, not least because she looks stunning in the costume. Michael Caine as Alfred could be forgiven for simply turning up yet manages to bring quite a few tears to the eye as someone watching the closest person he has to a son potentially head to their grave.But the film belongs to Batman, and that's thanks to Christian Bale. If he was overshadowed by Heath Ledger's excellent performance in 'The Dark Knight', here he takes the film back for the vigilante and rises victoriously. In fact, sadly one of the things the film really lacks is a performance like Ledger, such was the power there. Still, Bale growls and grimaces, contemplates and sacrifices. It takes a good forty minutes for Batman to actually appear - a brave decision by Nolan - and the film really examines what it means to fight for good in a corrupt world by mirroring Batman's fight with Bane's more villainous revolution.The set pieces are stunning, in particular a memorable scene in a football stadium, and its refreshing that Nolan refuses to go down the 3D road. Hans Zimmer's score pounds away with rough, tribal chants and violence. When it comes to the ending, some would argue that Nolan perhaps goes too far. But the important thing to realise is that he has ended this franchise, he has ended this trilogy. The question now is, for Nolan, where the hell does he go from here? 9/10",9,3,7,3 August 2012
Toy Story 3," 'Toy Story 3'
","The problem with three-quals, in particular the more recent three-quals, is that they usually run out of steam halfway through Part 2. One can also understand how an audience could grow to be ever so slightly cynical, that studios make these films for the sake of big bucks alone.That has never been a criticism one can throw at Pixar. Throughout their history they have kept on redefining what it is to be a truly fantastic movie for every single person, save for one or two slight hiccoughs along the way ('Cars' in particular). The fact that they were able to not only pull off a worthy sequel to 'Toy Story' back in 2000 but to also make it an infinitely more superior film to its predecessor, in a way already fills you with confidence that they know what they're doing. This isn't going to be one of the Shrek films. This is going to have a message and, more importantly, a heart.Though the beginning is perhaps slightly hampered by a rather lacklustre pre-film short, you're very quickly thrown back into the world of Woody, Buzz and co as if it were only yesterday. A fantastic voyage into the imagination of young Andy develops into a sweet little montage, the familiar strains of Randy Newman's 'You've Got A Friend In Me' backing it. But then the music fades away, and so does the warmth. We're thrown into the present day - for the toys, it's a time of uncertainty and loneliness, stuffed away in a toy chest in the teenage Andy's room, anxious about their future with his impending journey to college.This is truly where the film sweeps the rug from under your feet. It proves to be a somewhat different film than anyone really expects. There are some immensely dark moments peppered throughout, be they provided by the sense of loss and fear of being forgotten or the rather scary baby doll who patrols the floors of the Day Care Centre that the toys mistakenly end up in. A word of warning here; this is NOT a film for the very young. If the baby doesn't freak you out, the security cymbal-playing monkey almost certainly will.The script is excellent, and the darkness is broken up by moments of great light and laugh-out-loud humour, most of which is provided by the hilarious John Ratzenberger as Hamm. Two other stand out parts include a jailbreak where Mr Potato Head (Don Rickles) becomes an altogether different vegetable, and a reset button on Buzz that gives director Lee Unkrich the chance to make this film probably the first animated film to ever have subtitles.New characters that are introduced don't feel crowded, the handy plot device of Andy's growing up meaning several familiar faces don't appear in this movie. Barbie finally gets her Ken (a very funny Michael Keaton), and the main antagonist, a purple bear who is wonderfully played by Ned Beatty, helps to add to the film's sense of melancholy. Despite these new characters, and the fact that technology has moved on a lot in ten years, our old toys still look and sound the same, and kudos to Tom Hanks and Tim Allen for taking the film as seriously as any other dramatic part, the only way it could possibly work.The final third of the film is full of twists and turns, and several moments that had me choking up and blubbering like a baby. You don't feel cheated at all - you really get a sense that this is the last part of a fantastic three-qual. One certainly hopes so, though one cannot help but be a little nervous as to what the Disney executives could do in Direct-To-DVD mode when all they see is big dollar signs. This is the best ending anyone could ever give the toys. They are redeemed and, in a way, reborn.Strange short aside, and even though it's perhaps not a patch on Number 2 (nor on 'Wall-E' or 'Up'), this is certainly a brilliant film, and is guaranteed to win at least one Oscar next year.8/10",8,1,1,20 July 2010
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Fantastic Mr. Fox
","Mr. Fox (George Clooney) used to be a highly-skilled food thief, until the day his wife (Meryl Streep) announced she was pregnant. Now he's a newspaper columnist, yet still gets that itch. When he scratches it, the farmers he steals from decide to get their revenge...As adaptations go, Wes Anderson's take on Roald Dahl's children's classic could be defined as 'loose'. That doesn't make the film unendurable, but it does mean that this film loses just a hint of the magic that other adaps of Dahl's work have.The stop-motion puppetry, though at times a little crude, is still deserving of applause; it's different, you don't see this kind of animation any more. The crudeness actually helps to define it as a Wes Anderson film: slightly off-beat, odd ball with a quietly delicious sense of surreal humour. Why hasn't Anderson done animation sooner? In fact, one could argue that with his style of storytelling Anderson is quietly becoming one of the few auteurs that there are in the world today. An impressive voice cast - recorded out in the real world for most scenes instead of studios - help to bring the story to life, though Anderson's attempts to flesh the characters out sometimes create more of a problem. In particular, Bean the cider farmer (Michael Gambon) is promoted to head villain, whereas in the original novel all three farmers are equal in importance and hate for the fox.The script finishes the main story of the novel two-thirds into the film, before branching out into a rescue mission for an abandoned fox cub. This actually works quite well, and is helped by good jokes, great animation and a nifty score. The music is lovely in this film throughout, including a great cameo by Jarvis Cocker.Purists wont like it, and the very young will probably feel alienated by it, something a closer adaptation might have avoided, but on the whole this is a lovely film, a great addition to Anderson's work. 7/10",7,0,1,22 February 2012
Rear Window," Classic Hitchcock
","Alfred Hitchcock was one of the greatest film directors during the first half of the twentieth century. His films have become legends in their own right, and have established a style and genre all of their own. the term 'Hitchcockian' is now widely used for a film today where all the elements of a Hitchcock film have been exploited to the highest level. Very few films can break this mould and be truly considered in the same league as some of this great man's work.'Rear Window' is probably in the same group as other memorable Hitchcock movies. They are all memorable, of course, but there are one or two classic Hitchcock movies - such as 'North By Northwest' and, of course, 'Psycho' - that are TRULY memorable. You can tell when a movie is memorable, for example, when 'The Simpsons' parody the film in an entire episode - see 'Bart Of Darkness', it's very good and very funny.James Stewart is in the lead role, playing L.B.Jeffries, a photo-journalist who has broken his leg and spends his days staring out of his apartment window at all the neighbours. There is a very quiet, but quite apparent fascination here that Hitchcock explores brilliantly. Although it is never mentioned, and it is not strongly suggested, there is an element of something in this movie that helps to give the movie one of its classic Hitchcock themes - exploring taboo subjects very, very slightly. There's the newly-married couple who never seem to get out of bed, the ballet dancer who practises in her underwear, and the sculptor who lives underneath her. With the songwriter in his penthouse apartment providing incidental music, we also have the suicidal and lonely woman who craves the love of another, and the elderly couple who sleep outside on the balcony and use a basket to give their dog some exercise.And then, of course, there's the Thorwalds. Here the main aspect of the plot comes into play. Jeffires becomes convinced that Mr Thorwald (played by Raymond Burr, who would go on to play 'Ironside') has murdered his wife and done away with the body. Using his photographic lenses, Jeffires spies on Thorwald, trying to catch a glimpse of anything that will help prove his suspicions.He is helped through this by three individuals. The first is his lover, Lisa Fremont (Played by the beautiful Grace Kelly), a woman who Jeffries believes is too perfect for him. The second is his masseuse and helper from the insurance company, Stella, (Thelma Ritter), who provides some of the funniest lines in the film with her dark, sometimes twisted humour. Finally, and the one who needs the most convincing of all, there's Jeffires' old friend from the air force, Detective Doyle (Wendell Corey). However, his involvement only complicates matters, as he constantly brings out evidence that Mrs Thorwald is not dead, but simply on holiday.The final half-hour or so of the film has quite a few twists and turns. The eventual conclusion, that Thorwald IS a murderer, is something you want to happen. this is another of those Hitchcockian elements. As an viewer you WANT the man to be a murderer, because you are so sure that Jeffries is right, and you yourself get frustrated when he is constantly proved wrong. There is an extremely tense scene at the end of the film involving Jeffries and Thorwald that puts you on the edge of your seat. The use of light in this scene particularly is excellent.This is a very good film, and something to watch either with a loved one or just by yourself. Stewart is excellent and constantly dominates the screen even if he is stuck in a wheelchair for most of the film. Grace Kelly is very talented as an actress, and there are one or two rather daring scenes for the 1950s that show you that Hitchcock was full aware of the changing attitudes towards this sort of thing. I also think that Thelma Ritter deserves a mention, as she holds the film together with her witty comments and is largely ignored by some reviewers.But the real stars are the neighbours of Jeffires. The whole film is shot from the room in Jeffries' apartment, which is in itself a wonderful idea. Whenever we see through that window something new and interesting is happening for each of the neighbours - be it witty, like the newly wed woman who can't seem to get enough, or tragic, like the lonely woman who lives underneath the Thorwalds. The final scene shows Jeffries, not only with two legs broken, but also facing away from the window. He does not need to watch his neighbours any more. this is a nice touch, and it symbolises that all is going to go well for our friend Jeffries. Plus Grace Kelly is on his couch, so that's a bonus as well!",7,2,4,24 March 2005
Sin City," 'Sin City'
","I had heard the hype, the glories thrown at the feet of this film, read the snide comments thrown at subsequent films which apparently were trying to be like 'Sin City'. So, when the time came, I knew I had to watch this film.I am SO glad I did. This film blew me away from pretty much the first minute. The wonderful use of monochrome with the little splashes of colour truly make this a fantastical, yet realistic world. The big name stars are all impressive, particularly Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke. The violence is a weird but brilliant mixture of realism and cartoonish - we never see the full extent to a lot of the gory scenes, at least we didn't in the cut I watched. But a splash of blood - and there's a lot of it in this film - is all we need to see to know that, whatever's happening off screen, it ain't pretty.I think the true success of the film has to be Frank Miller's co-direction. This is, after all, his baby, and it's such an inspired though obvious idea to have him direct the feature film of his graphic novel. With him at the helm you can be sure that no fan boys will be disappointed. Although I haven't read the books myself, I want to now, that's for sure, and that's part of 'Sin City''s magic.I do have one or two little nit picking problems - Jessica Alba, though gorgeous, doesn't really have much to do here apart from snog Bruce Willis and be generally mistreated by most of the other blokes. And Clive Owen is great, but is the character supposed to be English, or could he not be bothered to join the rest of the male cast in their deep, gravelly American voices? That's another little problem I had - nearly all the main blokes sounded the same. Were they supposed to? On the whole though, a great film! Can't wait for the proposed sequel - this one I'll HAVE to see at the cinema!8/10",8,0,2,9 January 2008
V for Vendetta," 'V for Vendetta'
","Having never even picked up the graphic novel this film is based on, let alone read anything by Alan Moore, I was a complete novice when viewing this film. I think that this helps - I know that if I had been a true fan of the book I would have been on here straight away complaining about what the Wachowski brothers had done to it.As it was, I really enjoyed this film. We are introduced to Natalie Portman's character almost straight away. Her performance is a little dodgy to begin with but towards the middle of the film it really strengthened and I really warmed to her. I think it's because that's when we start to learn more about her past, and then we have the rather long scenes of torture (with a wonderful twist at the end, by the way) in which Portman really needs to show such a mixed bag of emotions. It redeems her for the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy at any rate.Hugo Weaving is V, the title character - and there you have to take their word for it. You never, ever see V's face - just a Guy Fawkes Mask on a figure clothed entirely in black, reminding some of us of No Face from 'Spirited Away'. It is difficult to sympathise with V - he truly cares for Evey, and his plans to rid England of John Hurt's Sutler and his Fascist government mean well, but he is at the other end of the spectrum a terrorist and a bit of a madman come to that. This is partly explained with the origins story that every 'superhero' film needs, but I still felt uneasy about the character, despite the brilliant performance of Hugo Weaving.The supporting cast are fantastic, though apart from Stephen Rea's character we could see a bit more of them. Stephen Fry is rather good in a rare dramatic role which ends violently, but John Hurt's villain is more of a cameo performance than anything else, despite been rather ironic considering his past roles (Winston in '1984' has now literally become Big Brother).Overall the film is really good, though there are a couple of unanswered questions, and the political overtones do rather overshadow the film in this post 9-11 world.7/10",7,0,2,15 January 2007
The Godfather," 'The Godfather' of all movies.
","'The Godfather' is much, much more than a great film - it's a legendary film, regarded by thousands as the greatest ever made. And its continual reign at the top of the IMDb.com top 250 proves this. There have been so many reviews written about this movie and its subsequent sequels, so much written about it - not only here on this website but in magazines, books, universities, the whole caboodle - that someone like me has to be careful that their review doesn't go over too much old ground and become boring. Unfortunately, to a large extent, 'The Godfather' is famous for people being unanimous about what makes it so good and so I will probably have to repeat what countless others have said.Certainly one can not fault the story itself - a magnificent tale of life in the Mafia and, in particular, of the development of the youngest son of Don Corleone (Marlon Brando), Michael (Al Pacino). The screenplay, adapted by Mario Puzo and Coppola from Puzo's own novel, is a breathtaking affair of first-class writing and suspense, and is a fine example of what is sadly missing in many of today's films. The fact that we, as an audience, are drawn into this world by the way in which it takes its time to unravel its many different layers is something that a lot of filmmakers don't consider today.Take, for example, the scenes after the attempted murder on Corleone. The audience are told exactly what is going to happen with Michael's revenge, so that everything will seem plausible when the time comes. Think about it; if we had cut straight to the scene in the restaurant after Michael's announcement that he is going to kill Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) then the fact that Michael finds a gun in the bathroom would seem ridiculous and we would not believe it. It is like this throughout all the film - everything is explained to us, every last piece of information needed to tell us why this thing happens later on in the film, why he dies at this moment. It means that the movie takes its time - the DVD version I have is aprox. 164 minutes long - but in a sense you lose track of time because you are so engrossed in the story.The acting is superb, not just Pacino or Brando, though these two do stand out, but the whole cast, even the extras in Sicily. Again, like every nook of the script, Coppola uses and manipulates every actor's potential to get the performance we deserve as an audience. There's a wonderful scene before the one mentioned earlier where the sons and Tom are discussing what to do next and they're all talking over each other. Utterly believable and excellent.The film is shot beautifully. I'm no expert on this area and I do try to steer clear of it in reviews, but there's no doubt at how gorgeous the whole film looks. The colour is vibrant, and yet the shadows play such an important part in the key scenes. I believe it really reaches its full potential in the scenes in Sicily, truly capturing the beauty of the country, which in turn is transposed to the beauty of Appollina.There are one or two flaws - after all, there has never been and never will be an utterly perfect film, despite what some people say - which are also, ironically, perfectly plausible. The female characters are weak and although this is obviously demonstrating the role of the woman in the Mafian society, Diane Keaton's character could have been stronger. Also, although wonderfully written, the script does need paying attention to, otherwise you are going to find yourself lost in a maze of Italian names.What you cannot argue against, however, is the violence. Yes, 'The Godfather' is a violent film, but the great thing about this violence is that Coppola only uses it WHEN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. Unlike many films today, the violence in this movie is essential to the plot, to keep it driving on and also to give us a fantastic character study of Michael, particularly towards the end of the movie.Enough's being said; if you haven't seen this movie you HAVE to see it, just to see what all the fuss is about. That's what I did, and it turned out all right for me. I mean, I haven't found a horse's head in my bed....yet.9/10",9,0,2,11 March 2006
