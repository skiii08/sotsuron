Lucky Number Slevin," Not the flick for me!
","The pickings were slim when we (2 '50ish' women) tried to choose a movie to see this evening, and LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN won by process of elimination. While I can't claim to hate the movie, I found the plot to be convoluted and the guts and gore a bit overdone. Our fellow movie watchers were laughing at many scenes in which the humor somehow escaped me. Dare I say that this movie really wasn't much of a 'chic flick'? (Fellow feminists, Mea culpa!) I think my husband will definitely love this one when it comes to cable, which I imagine will happen soon...I read one comment that compared this movie to PULP FICTION, an opinion I definitely don't share. Since the form said I had to write a bit more to submit my opinion, I guess the last thing I am wondering about is what was with Josh Hartnett's hair? Guess I really am getting old!",7,3,11,22 April 2006
