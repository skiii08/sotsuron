The Lobster," I know it's 'trending' on Netflix but DON'T DO IT
","The concept of a dystopian world where so-called 'loners' (single people) must find a mate within 45 days or be transformed into an animal of their choice sounds like a concept for a dark rom-com. If you're expecting a humorous dystopian drama such as 'Warm Bodies,' this is NOT IT. The movie becomes increasingly bizarre as it progresses, and it utterly unenjoyable. Save yourself a couple hours and read the synopsis if you're really that curious about the plot of the movie. There is not a single relatable or loveable character, nor is there a redeeming plot to the film. This movie is depressing, dark, and strange. You're not bored enough to watch this movie - this is scraping the bottom of the barrel, just DON'T.",2,4,5,17 December 2018
