The Benchwarmers," Jon Heder, I will pray for you...
","I'm not a very difficult person, and I'm not very hard to please when it comes to movies. I don't mind watching a harmless, gross-out comedy once in a while, and I laugh at most of the jokes, even those that aren't supposed to be that funny (heck, I found Date Movie hilarious...that should give you an idea on how easy it is to make me laugh). However, this was just plain awful. I mean, when Rob Schneider is the best element of a movie (which isn't saying much), you know you're in for something really, really stupid. The jokes are so unfunny, it's painful.There's only so much you can do with farts and bodily fluids... Even the kids at my screening didn't laugh. I usually adore David Spade because of his bratty attitude and caustic humor, but his character in Benchwarmers is completely uninteresting. As for Jon Heder... What happened to the young, promising actor who made audiences laugh with his character of Napoleon Dynamite? It seemed like you had such a beautiful career ahead of you! But now, it's only a matter of time until you hit rock bottom and join the 'Unfunny actors who have lost all credibility because they keep making bad movie choices' club which your co-star Schneider has been part of for quite some time now. But I have faith in you Jon! I know that you can still redeem yourself! As for the plot, it is a rehash of something we've seen thousands of times, and you'll be lucky if you don't fall asleep. Saying that it's harmless is an understatement : it's too boring and bland to have any kind of impact.",2,8,16,8 April 2006
