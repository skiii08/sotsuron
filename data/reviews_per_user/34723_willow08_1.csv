Skyfall," Dispensable protects the Indispensable...
","Firstly may I say I have never written a review before, I am far from being an expert film critique. Secondly I am not a hater of Daniel Craig and thirdly nor am I a hater of change.There are many good and bad reviews on here and in general they talk about the action scenes, the missing bond girls and the lack of gadgets throughout the film etc... I honestly believe that whilst they are generally a bond tradition, they are highly irrelevant in this case. This is simply because the story line is so weak that no amount of gadgets and girls would have helped.The cinematography in this film is amazing, the actors and actresses are generally faultless and the action scenes are good but with such a poor story line I felt myself not caring in the slightest what was going to happen next.How can a film begin with Bond being so dispensable yet the rest of the film is all about him protecting his apparent indispensable boss. This may seem like a minor point but think about it. Is there any thought to the mi6 agent killed at the beginning of QoS? Or the bond girl killed with oil. No there isn't because as an audience we accept that there is an inherent risk to those members assigned to the security services and more importantly there is the bigger picture to consider. So we don't dwell on the deaths but rather swiftly move on with the rest of the story. Unfortunately with this film there isn't a bigger picture.That is not the only flaw to the plot. As highlighted by many already, there is a rather impressive opening sequence all about Bond retrieving a hard drive, yet its whereabouts is never answered. And the Bond villain himself. I agree entirely with the notions that he is similar to the joker and I think this is justified. But more importantly why have such a clever complex plot to get to M. If he is capable of all that, surely it should leave the audience wondering why he didn't just go straight for M.Casino Royale was a great film and I could even take good things from the much weaker QoS but Skyfall is massively let down by a very poor plot with very poor dialogue.",3,31,63,30 October 2012
