First Man," Half in half out
","5 out of 10 for me. 
I am half in 'it was good?' and half out 'it was slightly horrible?'The opening grabber scene is great. Long, but great. The movies loses momentum at the halfway mark for me. I should really figure this out, but I am pretty sure the body count is higher in First man than in the Halloween movie. I see where the director wanted to go with this. An intense time for Neil, a backstory for him, but it does not add up to me as being fluid. I left like 'Well, didn't know much about him. He had a sad life.'There was a great love for 'proving' the drama of the movie by giving so much credit to the camera and not giving the actors their time to make the moment momentous. But grade A for high def. You can see the acne on Buzz and see all the tiny little freckles on Claire.The rocket scenes are filmed like a horror movie. Ryan's eys, loud rattling, ryan's eyes, loud explosions, ryan's eyes. Over and over again. Imagine The blair witch project, but with a bigger budget and 60's manners and you got First man. I want to see this movie re cut and about 25 minutes shorter....and with Claire only using an American accent......and Neil more likeable.",5,10,16,17 October 2018
The Lion King," Directed as if this was an EPIC saga
","I think the larger fault comes from the way it was directed.
Next, as a beloved musical with catchy (already written and loved) best filled scenes this version fell flat. Speak singing is not singing ya'll just like ya'll is not a legit word (ha).
So when a musical is made without the qualities you find in musical theatre and it is directed and filmed like an EPIC coming of age story geared toward an adult audience (ahem, lack of fun, and about 40minutes too long) I don't know what a studio expectsThe humor and child goofiness/charisma is not there. Timon and Pumba were the only memorable moments for me (I find both actors funny)-so full disclosure-U had a family member rant about how much they disliked those characters etc etc)
No doubt the cgi was spectacular (all those props go to the artists behind that intensive work!) and I hope they are nominated For art direction",4,0,0,7 August 2019
