The Perks of Being a Wallflower," See the wallflower... It sees you...
","I can't really say why I delayed seeing this movie for so long... Maybe I just expected another coming of age drama with an ambition to avoid appearing like another teenage movie. And I am certainly not sure why people feel like you need to relate in order to like the movie. I'm not a teenager. My high school years were nothing like characters' and I still think it's a little masterpiece. Forgive me if I'm wrong but trying to find connection to the movie by relating to Charlie's or Sam's or Patrick's story( like some people here said is the only way you could like this movie ) doesn't seem like the right approach. If anything, this movie is a learning experience. It's all there. From being accepted to accepting; from wanting to protect to being protected, trusting and being trusted, loving and being loved... And it doesn't focus on just one of those aspects. It combines them and creates this beautifully terrifying mess you have to fight through. For me, this story is an ode to love - every possible kind of it there is. And in the end - I was blown away by Logan Lerman's performance. Ezra Miller is an established young star and there was no surprise there, while Emma was the perfect fit for the character of Sam. The only thing I could name as something I didn't like were flashbacks - sometimes too confusing, although I'm sure book gives much more information ( I intent to read it ). Ending was great, circled everything perfectly. I would recommend this movie to everyone. As I said before it's a little masterpiece.",9,1,2,18 September 2013
