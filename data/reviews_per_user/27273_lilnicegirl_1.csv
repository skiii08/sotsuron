National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Terrific Movie
","I don't give perfect scores since that means no room for improvement, but if I had, I would have given it.I am not sure why the last person commented on Ed Harris' character being irrelevant or that the movie made no sense. It made perfect sense to someone that actually watched it and was able to understand it.The move started out showing the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. It includes how Thomas Gates got involved. Then we move to current time and as Nicolas Cage, a professor was giving the history lesson and speaking on behalf of his ancestors, Ed Harris' character speaks up and says that he has proof that it is all a lie and that Thomas Gates was one of the people involved in the assassination of AL.The whole story made sense.The book of secrets, it had relevance because of the missing artifacts.The whole movie was in perfect order and yes, there was humor, but not immature humor. It went well with the characters and showed a relationship amongst them.I love movies like this. Where one puzzle leads you to another and NT picked up from it's original and the second did it's call of duty. It even left a possibility of a trilogy.Even in one moment, it had me tear up a little. Even though you know that NC is the main character, there was this one part where it had you thinking... possibly, he could die and he did a noble thing and the scene was a little tear dropping.Go see it... you will enjoy it.",9,1,3,28 December 2007
