Minority Report," A Science Fiction Version of 'The Fugitive'. Brilliant!
",One of my favourite thrillers. To me this is more of Sci-Fi version of 'The Fugitive'. Cruise is brilliant in this movie & Speilberg done a much better job as in A.I. I would love that Pre-Crime to be a reality. But this wouldn't happen in real life. Or could it?,Null,0,0,2 December 2002
Minority Report," Better Than A.I
","The last Speilberg movie that saw was A.I: Artificial Intelligence, that one was all right but it just on the slow side. The this one starring Tom Cruise is much, much better than A.I.Think of Minority Report a sci-fi version of The Fugitive. Cruise is John Anderton, a police officer who works for the precrime department, and for six years there hasn't been a murder. The system is perfect, that what Anderton thinks. Until something went wrong, he find that he is the next suspect. Just over 30 hours berfore the murder has tken place. But the question is why?The film as good a any other movie that about someone accused of murder. Like The Fugitive I've just mentioned.Based on Philp K. Dick's short story, Speilberg unfortunately hadn't wrote the script but still it just good has all the other Steven Spielberg movie.I just seen two days ago and it's brilliant. Tom put a good performace.9 out of 10.",Null,0,0,15 July 2002
Blade II," Bigger, better and darker than the first.
","The first movie was good, but since there was a whole lot of vampires it wasn't scary but then again maybe it wasn't supposed to be. Blade 2 however is bigger, better and darker than the first. And who'll play Blade better than Wesley Snipes?Snipes is superb as Blade. He hasn't changed at all from the first. If you hadn't seen the first, do so now before you watch this brilliant sequel.Blade has to save the world from a new breed of vampires, though they are not your average vampire. Why you say? Because I'm not telling you whoever you are, you'll just have to see it that's why.Anyway, this film is as good as you would expect it to. Once you read this just tight and enjoy.Nine of Ten.",Null,0,8,16 May 2002
Blade II," Better Than the first.
","Wesley Snipes stars again as Blade, half vampire and half human. This could Snipes best film in years. The first Blade film was good, but not that good. But it was good enough to spawn a sequel. If there's another Blade film, who would do it better than Snipes.",Null,0,4,15 May 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Much, much better than the original.
","Let me tell you, this film is the best action film of the year...until the Matrix 3 comes out that is. But not talking about that film, I'm talking about this film The Matrix Reloaded. Okay first things first is that this better than the original, action wise that is. The fight scenes, totally fantastic. The film is clever with the story line, but to honest with you the story line is weak. The reason is that there is not much story line in there. But to make up for the weak story line is the action, the fight scenes and one thing I haven't mentioned yet is the the special effects.
The special effects are definitely better than the first, not to say the special effects in original film isn't good. It was and now The Matrix is a classic. And so will this film and the third film. The cast is well put together in this film, the directors done an excellent job in providing us that is the world of The Matrix. I just can't wait for the third film to come out. I highly recommend that you see this. 9 out of 10",Null,0,0,2 June 2003
