Your Name.," ABOUT MY UNCONDITIONAL LOVE
","For me seeing your name is just like a passionate hug from someone very dear to me.... The warmth of my heart continues deep inside. No matter how many times I have seen this or will see this it always move me deeper and more deeper. it gives a current of excitement and emotions in its own way. I can feel every bit that Makoto Shinkai Put in this work. The jaw dropping animations , the passion in music, the breath catching moments , even the smallest details become magical.May be it is not a masterpiece, may be there r many films better than this.
But for me there will be less better films than your name, there will be far more superior film than ' Your Name ' but there is no film like ' Your name '.
You know, there r some moments , when just a good work surpasses brilliant doings. Miracle pushes through realities. Willpower conquers destiny. And at that moment, when your heart overcome your mind.... That feeling is ' Your Name ' for me....
YES I DO LOVE YOUR NAME. I LOVE UNCONDITIONALLY. AND I ALWAYS DO.
It makes me believe in miracles. It makes me believe that, someone far enough , waiting for me, who is just made for me and me only. It makes me believe that, if your love is so faithful, faithful enough for each other then even nature finds way to your union.
YOU ARE SO DESTINED TO BE TOGETHER, THAT EVEN DESTINY CAN NOT MAKES YOU APART.------------ That is your name for me. My true fillings, a faithful and unconditional love ....",Null,0,0,1 February 2019
