Hereditary," Good acting, not scary at all, awful plot and pacing
","With this super-b cast, good looking shots, interesting setup (diaroma-reality), all that hype after the trailer screening in a kids movie and all that, you would expect an awesome movie. But this was such a bad movie. Story, editing and pacing were a complete mess. Few 'scary' parts, that weren't actually scary. At the middle point, I wanted to walked out and later regreted not doing it. Near the end, people started laughing at my screening. I started laughing too because it was so ridiculous and badly executed. People comparing this movie to 'The Exorcist', 'Rosemary's Baby', 'The Babadook' and 'The Witch' make me laugh so hard. This is an awful movie, I felt robbed. I don't know where these people loving this movie are coming from.",4,12,33,11 June 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Best animated comic book superhero movie ever!
","Great soundtrack, awesome animation and use of that comic book style, also great twists. Though its rather predictable and has some cringy moments (there's the 8/10) it's an awesome movie. You'll laugh, get sad/excited and will leave the theatre with a warm fuzz in your chest. I love this kind of movies.",8,0,2,12 January 2019
