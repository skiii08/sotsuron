The Expendables 2," expendable (define: Of little significance when compared to an overall purpose)
","Bad acting doesn't even begin to describe this moving. Old action stars who look and act old. I felt bad for them, really. It reminded me of another movie, Lies and Illusions. It's so bad, it's almost like they did it on purpose. Terrible plot... unoriginal, predictable and uninteresting... I mean seriously... JC Van Damme and Chuck Norris???!!! In the same film??!! HAA HAA HAA!!! There is nothing about this movie I enjoyed more than the credits. Unless you really need a laugh (because it's more comical than anything else), then I would not count on this to give you your fill of action/adventure. You've been warned!",3,1,5,7 October 2012
