The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Don't Bother with this money mongering movie!
","LESS than awful it's really a zero but I can't even give it that. Absolutely trash, they should have never made the first movie, let alone this one and the following movie they're making now! Don't even bother going to see this heap in the theaters. wait till it comes out on DVD/blue-ray, don't even bother PAYING for those either, as it will encourage them to make more garbage movies like this and the first one. Save your hard earned money and go spend it on something much nicer for yourself or someone else you care about. This movie and the previous one were and are EPIC fails. Part 2 will be more of the same, don't fall for their tricks again people. This movie series is one of the worst ever of the last 20 years!",1,31,46,29 November 2014
