Iron Man 3," Undeserving to be called Iron Man 3, the movie should aptly be named Tony Stark 3
","CONTAINS SPOILERSAs you can tell from my score, am I happy with how this movie has turned out? Definitely not! Since when was it okay to sacrifice the original source material just for the sake of comedy and humor. Is the general audience so demanding that we enjoy a few laughs in the cinema that we must make a mockery of the origins of the Iron Man characters? If you have any shred of knowledge about the villains of Iron Man you'll know that firstly I am referring to the Mandarin. What on EARTH was going through Shane Black's mind when he thought 'oh I know the Mandarin is the equivalent of Batman's joker, but for the sake of my poorly conceived plot i'll make him a badgering, drug addicted, false loony.' I will say the build up to the Mandarin's eventual fraud was quite good. It made me feel as though the Mandarin was going to be one menacing villain. However, when you build a villain up to be what he is intended to be only to tear him down to a piece of crap twist only serves to infuriate the fans of the comics even more. Sure you get a few laughs from the audience who are only there for the general purpose of being entertained by the latest superhero flick, but what do you do to the Iron Man legacy?! Marvel has started something wonderful by establishing consistent characters, stories and settings across multiple film franchises to bring them all together and make the Avengers. 20 years from now do you know how the legacy of Iron Man will be received? The casual fans aren't going to be the ones who have any say b/c they would have long forgotten about the movie. But the true comic book fans who turn what Marvel have done into a cult classic will say 'remember how Shane Black made a complete mockery of the Mandarin?' Now back to the movie itself. What was up with the inconsistency in the power of the suits? I didn't realize Iron Man had suddenly turned into Glass Man. The fights that Tony overcame against the Extremis agents weren't even from his efforts alone. He was either controlling a suit from a safe distance, getting Jarvis to clean them up, enlisting the aid of a kid, or relying on his girlfriend's newfound super powers to beat the villains. Did the definition of hero get lost in this movie somewhere? Yes I understand that the director was trying to go for the 'I'm still Iron Man without my suit' approach. But if you can't even display feats of heroism what the hell is that sentiment even good for?!Which leads me to my last point... Way too little of the Iron and way too much of the man. This movie should just be called Man 3 or as I already stated in the title: Tony Stark 3. What is the point of calling it Iron Man when 3/4 of the time you're not even in the suit and when you are, you've suddenly become a failure and not the competent Tony Stark/Iron Man we've come to understand in IM1, IM2 and the Avengers. Yes we understand that everyone has failures, even heroes. But it seems to me the biggest feat he even achieved in the whole movie was saving those ppl from the plane, and he wasn't even in the suit! Oh and of course when he called over his 40 or so suits. But was he doing anything at that point? Pretty sure Jarvis was controlling the helm.So in closing, this was a bad way to kick start the upcoming action- packed films for the rest of 2013 and I hope there are more like-minded ppl out there who realize this movie has done a terrible injustice to the comics. Please give the distribution rights back to Paramount who won't be afraid to endorse a grittier superhero take and won't turn a loved franchise into a comedy. And if you feel as I do, continue writing bad reviews on IMDb b/c it has no right to be a 7.9/10!",2,10,20,1 May 2013
Godzilla," A film more man than monster
","CONTAINS SPOILERSAn exciting return for Godzilla, which hopefully ushers in a new franchise for the king of monsters - the film plays out at a respectable pace, not too fast and not too slow. With the help of Cranston's riveting acting, the premise sets the scene for what you expect will be a great monster movie with an emotion-driven human element. With frequent teases of Godzilla traversing the seas for a good hour, it's Cranston's powerful display of tragedy that keeps the viewer interested in the human aspect. It's this performance that keeps you content with the film regardless of the fact that you've only been given tiny snippets of the huge beast. This tone sets the viewer up for huge optimism (at least it did me) when you know that surely Godzilla is going to make more frequent appearances in all his glory, and together with Cranston's brilliance you feel this is going to be a film more than just the king of beasts bashing heads but also a powerfully emotive picture of one human's search for truth and redemption.However, that is unfortunately as far as it gets. The feeling of the film setting you up for such but not delivering. This is all ushered in by the death of Cranston's character roughly 40 minutes into the film. And taking the lead role is now Aaron Taylor Johnson who plays a military bomb expert and the son of Cranston's character. From the moment of Cranston's exit to Johnson's taking lead point you notice a shift from passion to passive. Johnson is unfortunately completely dull and boring. And suddenly in every sense I am reminded of the death of Nicholas Cage's character in Kick Ass leaving Johnson to pilot the rest of the film as lead character. I suddenly didn't care for the human element of the film anymore and was ready to see Godzilla kick some ass! But to my dismay the Godzilla tease continued on for another 40 minutes as Johnson continually gets caught in the fray of illogical coincidences despite his initial intention of returning home to his wife and child. All the while Watanabe serving purely as a plot device to explain the meaning and purpose of Godzilla. Finally 80 minutes in and we get to see the king in action as he battles other monsters to claim his title as god of monsters. Unfortunately for the remaining 40 minutes of the movie, the battle scenes are way too short with only a couple of really kick ass moments for Godzilla and way too much of Johnson's dull acting (Can directors please stop giving this kid lead roles?!). Overall by the end of the film you don't get the feeling that you've seen Godzilla but rather military bomb man constantly stealing the spotlight. As a personal preference, I feel that Cranston should have survived (why kill off your best actor and the character you spent 20 minutes giving a backstory?) and he and Watanabe strive to defeat Godzilla using science but in the end Cranston is redeemed and moves on from his wife's death as he realises the folly of trying to defeat or control a force of nature (the analogy given to Godzilla by Watanabe). And as it was Godzilla rides off back into sea after defeating the other monsters. Or something along those lines at least!As a whole, the film is set up strongly but falls incredibly flat with the death of Cranston's character, which as a consequence is not replaced by Godzilla leading the remainder of the film but the boring, uninteresting and sleep-inducing acting of Aaron Taylor Johnson.",6,2,8,17 May 2014
