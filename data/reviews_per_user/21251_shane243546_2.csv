The Perks of Being a Wallflower," AMAZING! Well done, fantastic and award-worthy. The Best Book-To-Big-Screen I Have Ever Seen!
","This movies is just perfect! The best of all the book turned into movies. And what made it great is that the author of the novel is the one who directed the movie, making the movie well-developed emotionally. Logan Lerman did an amazing job with his acting, as always. I'm just sad that Emma is getting all the attention when he is the MAIN actor of this movie. Anyways, I loved how Chbosky directed the movie. He did so well keeping the pace of the story and flow of the story. He did really well.The only bummer is that the movie was focused on Charlie and his relationship with Sam and Patrick, leaving out his emotional connection with his family, especially his sister, Candace. But I can't blame Stephen for that because if he included it, the movie would be too long.The cinematography was so great. The script, amazing! The screenplay, good. And the direction, awesome! Also, the music and the score used in the movie is beyond perfect for the movie. Great movie, perfect movie, a definite movie to watch for Teenagers like me... XD",10,1,2,4 January 2013
The Impossible," Emotionally Amazing Movie, Made Me Cry Throughout The Whole Movie To Be Honest...
","This film is the first film that I'm gonna give a 8 out of 10. The screenplay and direction wasn't that great but the story and the acting was so compelling. I cried throughout the whole movie, to be honest. And I don't cry much when it comes to dramatic movies like this. But this one, this is different. It made me somewhat feel really sad and depressed and thankful at the same time that I'm in good hands. I would also like to suggest watching this movie while focusing on the emotions, putting yourself in their shoes. It would really help you understand the movie and feel the emotional essence of it. Lastly, Naomi Watts, my most favorite actress ever, as always, did a great job with her acting. But most of all, hats off to Mr. Tom Holland. His acting was so intense, emotional and overall amazing! He deserves and Oscar or a Golden Globe or any big awards for his wonderful performance.This film is a one to watch...",8,6,9,2 January 2013
