Skyfall," James Bond is Back ..... Finally !
","50 years of Bond! I've been a Bond fan since the beginning. This is the best Bond Film since the days of Connery. Daniel Craig is finally allowed to be James Bond and not a clone of Jason Bourne as he was in Casino Royale and the dreadful Quantum of Solace. Given this chance, he makes a good Bond.Skyfall combines the elements of the classic Bond films with all the modern ingredients and the film is highly entertaining. Bardem makes a menacing villain too.The other thing I appreciated was being able to see the action instead of the awful Bourne like cinematography that was used in Quantum.Bond is back.....Bond is alive......Looking forward to the next!",10,47,96,25 October 2012
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," SWE2 is far superior to The Phantom Menace.
","ATTACK OF THE CLONES is a return to the feel of the original trilogy. The characters and the story are far more interesting. The weaknesses are definitely in the dialogue and the acting between the two leads, Christensen and Portman, especially during the love story scenes. But the rest of the film is very entertaining, with striking visuals and memorable scenes. The action sequences, from chases to lightsabre battles (especially with Yoda), is Star Wars at it's best. I would place the film as my third favorite in the series behind EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and STAR WARS.",5,0,0,16 May 2002
Quantum of Solace," Worst Bond Ever
","I've been a fan of the Bond Series since Dr. No. This film has completely missed what a Bond film is and turned me off future movies in the series. It's even worse than the Dalton Bonds. Casino Royale had been a return to the feel of the original Connery films. This film is dull, long, boring and badly directed.Although I am not a fan of Craig as Bond, I felt sorry for him. They won't let him be Bond. He comes off more like a second rate Bourne. The photography was so bad you can't even tell when he is doing his own stunts! They could have used a woman as his stunt double and you wouldn't be able to tell. He even injured himself making this film!Somebody get these film makers a steady cam and a tripod so the audience see the action! Imagine all the great stunts of the early films if the picture was bouncing all over the screen.....awful!With the delay in the series over legal battles it may be years before the next one......Hopefully a new actor for Bond and back to the feel of Casino Royale and the original Connery films......and a cinematographer who knows what a tripod is!",2,13,18,24 August 2010
Casino Royale," Could have been one of the best.
","CASINO ROYALE could easily have been one of the best Bonds in the series. It was great to see a Bond that was a throwback to the classic Connery films. The film is full of incredible action sequences, good dialogue, locations, the darker mood is terrific, and the characters and the women are great too.It was well filmed and directed, and the casting was perfect, except for James Bond. Daniel Craig is a good actor and I have enjoyed him in other films, but he is not James Bond. He carries himself very well in the action sequences, but he has no charisma, and he lacks the screen presence of the previous Bonds, even when he seems to be copying Connery's style of line delivery. He comes off very wooden in his performance. He kind of looks like Steve McQueen's unattractive cousin, not James Bond! The J.B is supposed to stand for James Bond, not Jason Bourne (or Jack Bauer either)! It used to be other spy films copied the Bond films. Now the Bonds appear to be copying the Bourne films. Craig would make a very good Bourne.Too bad, as this film would have been fantastic with the right actor as Bond. I also didn't like the whole reboot idea of the series. It means that all the other missions never took place! If the film was to be a reboot and follow the Fleming book, why is Judi Dench, a hold over from previous Bonds films, in it? M was a man in the Fleming books, and having her there makes the whole reboot thing confusing. The title song is also very forgettable.To me, Connery was the one true Bond. Brosnan and Lazenby were very good too. Roger Moore was very Saintly in his Bond Comedies, and Timothy Dalton was the worst. I put Craig a cut above Dalton, but I can only hope that the producers come to their senses and replace him as Bond as soon as possible.I have read all the books and been a fan of the series since the beginning, and I did like the direction this film took getting away from the over the top situations and gadgets, but surely there is a better choice for Bond than Craig. As a Bond fan I hope they can make a change before the next film, as he didn't work for me. The adds say the critics are raving, it will make you forget all the other Bonds! I don't think anyone will ever forget Connery, and the critics are truly raving to even suggest it!Aside from Craig and the reboot, I thought it was a very good film. I take 1 point off for the whole reboot idea, and 2 points off for Craig.007 out of 10!",7,4,8,15 November 2006
