Howl's Moving Castle," A Beautiful Film
","I first watched this movie, not knowing anything about it. It had Miyazaki's name on it so I figured it would be good. I watched it and it seemed like a very long movie, but the entire time I was wanting more.The characters of this movie are moving and deep. Each brought something of their own to the story to make it a compelling and an interesting watch. Miyazaki captures you in with the first few seconds of the film with his beautiful artwork and interesting designs. The storyline, I feel, was very nice and flowed nicely even though I had a few questions (How the little kid ended up with Howl and a few other things) but I set them aside and really enjoyed the movie.The only thing that I really didn't like was Howls voice for some reason. I really really enjoyed Christian Bale, but I felt the voice was a little too heavy for Howl, I would have preferred a little more light hearted voice to play Howl.All and all, I loved this movie, as well as all of Miyazaki's films.",8,1,3,30 March 2006
