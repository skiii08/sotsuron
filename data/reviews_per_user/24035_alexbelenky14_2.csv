The Equalizer," Denzel Washington back at it with a touch of OCD
","This movie is based on the premise of the 1980's TV series of the same name. This movie and reboot to the series isn't exactly the non-stop action thriller most are expecting, but non the less, it's moody, violent, has good character development and a not so formulaic plot. The director, Fuqua does a good job in projecting a visually dark world - a sort of shadowy Noir underworld. Also, Robert McCall (Denzel) adds a touch of OCD to his character which plays a very unique role in the movie.Conclusion: It feels like a '90s action movie throwback. Done with the proper brutal violence, bloodshed, slow motion sequences and good acting. It's a very unique movie. Grade: 8/10 (8.5/10 if possible)",8,0,6,16 December 2014
Nightcrawler," Exhilarating from start to finish.
","Nightcrawler can be summarized as the 'There Will Be Blood' of slick L.A. based neo-noir dramatic thrillers. It's a sharp critique of contemporary social issues (such as media exploitation entertainment and the demand for it) that is then presented as a dark and disturbing tale about a ghoulish protagonist who prospers by abandoning any moral qualms he might have with the corrupt system that props him up. It's tense, exciting, bloody. It's amazing.Conclusion: Its a MUST see for movie buffs. Jake carries this movie with his amazing performance.Grade: 9/10 (one of my movies of the year)",9,1,2,17 December 2014
