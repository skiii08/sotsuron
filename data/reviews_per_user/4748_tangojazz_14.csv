Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 'Stars Wars' - The No Good Movie (The Phantom Menace)- Part I
","The absolute worse. When I saw the 'No Good Movie' (The Phantom Menace) when it first came out years ago, I didn't know what to make of it. After seeing it, I said to myself 'Aww, it was O.K. I guess' and that was it. I didn't see it a second time (unlike the original and the two sequels)and forgot about it. And now, years later, I know why. 'The Phantom' was incredibly unmemorable. Like who cares about it? It didn't excite my imagination and it didn't make me think about it all the time (unlike the original). That's it! I said to myself. I didn't care about the characters and the story was boring. Being a writer myself now, I can say George Lucas did not think through his story. Unlike the 'Original' the 'No Good Movie' did not speak to a person's heart. The 'Phantom' did not reach into mythology and make us ponder the eternal questions of human existence. The 'No Good movie' did not touch upon the 'eternal questions' brought up by the original 'Star Wars'. The questions are: why we are here, what is our purpose in life, what is the struggle between good and evil, etc. The original 'Star Wars' movie addressed these issues and has become timeless and immortal in status as a result. Which is why 'The No Good Movie'(Phantom Menace) will be forgotten and remembered as example of how not to make a movie. Sad but true.",1,0,3,7 May 2015
Skyfall," The name's Freud, Sigmund Freud!
","What kind of Bond movie is this? Why all the psychological underpinnings? They should show this movie at a Freudian analyst convention. So Daniel Craig (James Bond) is the symbolic good son of Judi Dench (M)and Javier Bardem is the symbolic bad son of M. They all go to this place called Skyfall, where James Bond was born. At Skyfall, the conflict between the mother and sons is resolved. What? Why all the psychological stuff? Well, I didn't put it there, the people who made the movie put it there. Was this stuff put in to make it more interesting? To me, this is the first 'Weird' Bond. I felt a lot of the stuff the movie was about had nothing to do with spying, secret agents, stuff like that. Because, you see, suppose you got a director like David Lynch to direct A James Bond movie. This 'Skyfall' is what it would look like.",4,11,23,13 November 2012
John Wick," If Satan ruled the world...the most vicious action movie, ever.
","It's Keanu Reeves greatest movie, ever! I can't believe how many people Keanu (John Wick) killed in this movie! Maybe 80 or more, I lost count. And over a dog! Yes, Keanu as the Anti-Christ, the most evil out of the evil, a destroying hell's angel, a veritable force of nature! Never have I enjoyed cheering on the bad guy (John Wick) so much. And it's also how he did it! Sometimes shooting the 80 or so bad guys each two or three times in the head and chest (John Wick had a lot of ammunition). I have not seen this much raw, explosive action in a long time. 'John Wick' felt like an amped up version of the Arnold Schwarzenegger action movies like 'Commando' or 'Raw Deal' but even more so! This has to be the most nastiest, nihilistic, existentialist, insane, outrageous, ironic, comedic, repellent and vicious action movie ever made! Guns, guns or more guns. It might make you throw up! And unbelievably, it might also make you laugh! There's also some great acting in this movie, by the way, from people like Willem DaFoe and Ian McShane.This also has to be the most Anti- Russian movie America has ever made. Russians left and right are being killed by the bushel full! So go see 'John Wick' now, if you've got the stomach for it. And treat your pets with kindness, or John Wick will hear about it! Finally, what would John Wick do to Batman?",10,8,20,30 November 2014
Gravity," Thrilling movie, but empty, not Science Fiction
","The movie 'Gravity' kept me glued to my seat. My attention was firmly focused on the adventures of 'Sandra & George', which is what the movie was really about anyway. Oh, granted, the special effects attempted to project a feeling of being in 'outer space' which worked somewhat (I didn't see it in 3-D). There was something missing. The thing that was missing was the 'awe and mystery' (I'm paraphrasing the opening description of the old sci-fi series 'The Outer Limits') of outer space. I wasn't really transported anywhere, which is what you want in a sci-fi movie. It felt more like a thriller to me that just happened to be in outer space. 'Gravity' was more about the 'Perils of Sandra Bullock' than any kind of science fiction. A roller coaster ride without any inspiration, just a ride. The old sci-fi movie that is somewhat similar to 'Gravity' called 'Capricorn One' was more closer to what the movie makers intended. Oh well.",4,0,2,20 November 2013
Pacific Rim," Giant MMA Robot vs. Monster Smackdown. Fantastic. But...
","Yes, this movie has certainly raised the bar on 'Monster Movies'. A definite leap forward from the 'the guy in the rubber suit' days. I give this movie 9 out of 10 for the imagination and special effects that dazzled throughout. The fights were the thing, though. Incredible. Especially the one where the American guy and the Japanese girl take on the flying whatchamacallit in outer space. But,I take away one star. Why? It is because the magic and wonder of the early cheesy 'Monster flicks' (the Japanese ones, the Korean one, Harry Hausen's creations) was not there. I, for one, think it wouldn't have been so bad if this was a joint American-Japanese production (Del Toro also being there to see that things didn't become cheesy). The old magic and wonder is missing. I was somewhat disappointed to see that the monsters could be killed by conventional arms (although you would need a lot of them) and that 'nukes' could definitely take them out. How would these monsters fare against 'Mothra', 'Rodan' and especially 'Godzilla'?But, see the movie, it's fun.",9,3,9,18 July 2013
Inside Out," The greatest psychology cartoon ever made!
","A great movie that appeals equally to children and adults. Not once did I turn away from the screen, which to me is a sure sign of the movie's greatness. 'Inside Out' is movie about the inner psychology of girl child named Riley from her birth to about eleven years old. The engine that drives the movie is the psychological changes that occurs when Riley's family moves from their home in Minnesota to the San Francisco Bay Area. The changes are represented amusingly enough by cartoon characters called Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Anger and Fear, in both Riley and her parents. To be honest with you, I had some reservations about seeing 'Inside Out.' The previous features I had seen about psychological change in people were pretty serious affairs: 'Steppenwolf' adapted from the novel by Herman Hesse and starring Max Von Sydow, and 'A Dangerous Method' directed by Horror Meister David Cronenberg and starring Viggo Mortensen and Keira Knightly. Movies definitely not for kids. So, I said to myself, how will Disney make a movie about such a loaded subject? Easy. Stay away from topics like mental illness and pathological criminality, and stick to child and family psychology. Throw in a lot of humor and cartoon slapstick, and you have a movie that talks about emotional growth without the more serious consequences (Although the movie does surprisingly goes to some pretty dark places in the mind, like the subconscious). Comedians Amy Poehler, Mindy Kaling and Lewis Black give outstanding performances as the various emotions that, for me, carry the movie. Go see this wonderful movie about 'Psychology 101' and also, be entertained.",10,6,30,25 June 2015
The Witch," 'The Witch' was stupid and it is not a horror movie.
","I was expecting to be frightened out of my mind, to have nightmares, to see homicidal witches around every corner....No. After seeing 'The Witch' last week, as the packed crowd for the evening showing laughed at the ending credits, my conclusion is that 'The Witch' is an unbelievably ridiculous and poorly done drama set in seventeenth century New England. The movie was about this overly religious Puritan family consisting of a father, a mother, a baby (which gets kidnapped at the beginning),some twins, a son, and a teen age daughter. They get kicked out of a conservative religious congregation for being too 'conservative.' The family get banished to a dark and creepy forest where they get their butts kicked by their own fear and stupidity, and then later on get knocked off one by one (except for the teen age daughter)by a group of homicidal 'killer' witches. I hated the whole damn family and didn't feel sorry for them at all. At all. First of all, this is my blow by blow description of why I hated them. First of all, there were the twin children who screamed and ranted throughout the picture like a bunch of god damn idiots. They were a big annoyance and distraction throughout. Why? Because they took me right out of the movie whenever they showed up on the screen. I felt like getting up and telling them to shut-up several times. I hated the extremely pathetic, needy mother. I thought the hulking, clueless dopey father was a moron. I was stunned at the stupidity of the son who had no sense of the danger he was in. I felt sorry for the daughter who just let everybody run over her. A lot of things in 'The Witch' didn't make any sense. Like when the family's baby was kidnapped at the beginning of the story, you would think they would run back to the town they had left and gotten the police to help them (which is what you normally would do in a situation like that). They didn't. I felt no sympathy for these people. And the ending was too idiotic to be believed. The teen age daughter gets turned into a naked crazy witch who flies in the air, laughing (with other, flying naked witches). Huh? What was that all about? The ending felt like it came from another movie. Well, like a Ken Russell movie from 60s and 70s (if you know who he is). See this movie at your own risk. Or not.",1,24,57,27 February 2016
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Reader's Digest version of 'Lord of the Rings'
","What the heck. I'm giving the 'Five Armies' seven stars. Why? Because I was riveted to my seat the whole movie, anxious to see what would happen next. The opening scenes of Smaug the dragon attacking the village was among the most spectacular scenes I have ever witnessed in the movies. Coming in second to that scene was Galadriel, Saruman and Elrond fighting the 'ghost' soldiers. Truly spectacular. Unfortunately, after that, 'Five Armies' changes into something like a video game. The plot is compressed (like the articles and stories of Reader's Digest). The presence and gravity of the original LOTR is absent. And the whole movie is CGIed to death. The whole thing feels 'rushed'. If only the 'Five Armies' had continued the momentum of the first two exciting action scenes, we would of had a different movie. But I guess, the people involved in making 'Five Armies' wanted to end the 'Hobbit' series real quick(and make a lot of money).",7,2,6,22 December 2014
Mother!," A somewhat interesting movie about the dangers of 'Drug Addiction.'
","I have seen the Youtube reviews of 'mother!' which have said that this movie is a metaphorical message about creation, god, Jesus Christ, etc. Really? I DIDN'T SEE IT THAT WAY AT ALL! The movie is really about the drug addiction of the lead character(a woman) as portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence. That's right, drug addiction. Every time Jennifer gets stressed out, she goes into the bathroom, takes some drugs, and then she feels fine. And then she hallucinates. As a matter of fact, the whole movie is just about her hallucinations from her drug abuse.That's all. Javier Bardem, who portrays Jennifer's husband in the movie, although not specifically stated, is probably a drug dealer supplying for their whole area. As a matter of fact, his clients are probably the huge group of people who visit them later in the film. Also, I want to say while the movie was mildly interesting, it was also incredibly boring. The teaser trailer for mother! was a complete lie. Mother! was portrayed as a 'horror' movie, when as a matter of fact, it was a 'boring' movie. Finally, about the drugs again. I would really like to know what drugs Jennifer's character was taking. Was it LSD? Was it Peyote? What?",4,1,8,17 September 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Move on! You just pick the 'Batman' or the 'Superman' you want!
","Yeah, I thought 'Batman vs. Superman' was an excellent movie. Why all the hate and controversy? It was just a very entertaining movie. 'B vs. S' was also a very profound, philosophical and dark look at 'power.' I liked that! The fans wanted the great graphic novel 'The Dark Knight Returns' on film and they got it! Yahhhh!!!!!! 'Batman vs. Superman' was an adult, realistic take on what would happen if superheroes really did exist and what ethical issues they would encounter as they used their powers. Great! As I watched 'B vs.S' in the movie theater, I could almost hear Hegel and Nietzsche discussing it behind me. A joke! Just kidding! Look, if you don't like 'B vs.S' there are other versions of these heroes you can like. Just pick one and MOVE ON. For instance, for Superman, there is: Kirk Alyn (1940s), George Reeves (1950s), Christopher Reeves (1970s), Dean Cain (1990s) and Brandon Routh (2000). Regarding 'Batman' here are the choices: ancient bats Lewis Wilson and Robert Lowery (1940s), campy bat Adam West (1960s), weird bat Michael Keaton (1989), semi-serious bat Val Kilmer (1990s), embarrassing bat George Clooney (1990s) and serious Ninja bat Christian Bale (2005). Just pick one. AND MOVE ON.",10,11,21,8 April 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," One of the best Star Wars movies ever, but not the best...
","Like I said in the summary, 'The Force Awakens' is one of the best Star Wars movies ever, but not the best. I would say, the best 'Star Wars' movie is yet to come. My reaction after having seen the movie twice (regular screen and 3D) and by the way, any movie that compels me to see it twice is a great movie, is that J.J. Abrams did a complete job in reestablishing the tone and feel of a real 'Star Wars' movie. And also, it reached out successfully to both the older and newer fans. The critical acclaim and box office receipts show that TFA is an unqualified success. Of course, now, we have to take into account the opinions of the 'haters' and/or 'trolls' who have trashed TFA. I would only have to say that 'if' the 'Star Wars' they want is realized (as I understand what they are saying), it would not longer be 'Star Wars' but it would be 'Battlestar Galactica'the 2004-2009 TV series, something totally different and not 'Star Wars.' I would say the negative opinions of these 'Haters' and/or 'Trolls' would be better served by petitioning Disney for a possible 'better' director that they want for the 'Star Wars' genre like for example Francis Ford Coppola or Kenneth Branagh. In addition, they could also ask for a screenwriter they could see as acceptable like David Mamet or Paul Schrader, or somebody like that. But as it is, J.J. Abrams did an outstanding job with 'The Force Awakens.' May be the force be with you.",10,9,44,6 January 2016
Godzilla," Not exactly the 'Godzilla' movie I was expecting...
","So O.K., Godzilla is making a ton of money at the box office. So O.K., Godzilla has a great script. But something is missing. GODZILLA! 'GODZILLA' doesn't appear for most of the movie. But the movie is named 'GODZILLA' it's about him, right? So where is he? It turns out that GODZILLA is a bit player in his own movie. It's like having a movie called 'DRACULA' and Dracula only appears in the last 10 minutes. The movie feels flat and very downbeat in attitude. There's a definite lack of dynamism in the whole production. In other words, it doesn't move you. I really did not care what happened to the characters on the screen. Compare this movie to the vastly superior 'Pacific Rim' where the scene of the little Japanese girl running away from the huge monster in Japan had a definite impact on me. The acting in Godzilla was horrible. The fighting scenes between the monsters were boring. Who cares. Boring. When I start to think I could have done a better job in directing and producing a movie I'm seeing, there's something wrong with the movie. Go watch 'PACIFIC RIM'.",1,10,26,16 May 2014
Cloud Atlas," The incredible Cloud Atlas!
","The motion picture of the year! It should be up for and win the Academy Award for Best Picture! If it doesn't, there's something wrong with the Academy. Cloud Atlas is a stunning combination of 4 or 5 different movies combined to make a statement about our humanity and connection with each other. I especially liked the convincing portrayal of people through time and space by Tom Hanks, Halle Berry (I now forgive her for her Catwoman role), Susan Sarandon, Hugo Weaving and other fine actors for stretching themselves (through use of makeup) in an actors dream roles. For all you New Age and Metaphysical believers, forget about all the other so-called 'New Age' theme movies (The Secret,etc.) you have seen, this is the 'Metaphysical' movie of all time (until a better movie of this type comes along). I especially like the ending where mankind connects up with their 'Outer Space' brothers and sisters. So the movie is three hours long! Big Deal! For me, the movie went by real quick and I wanted more.",10,6,17,27 October 2012
Mad Max: Fury Road," 'Mad Max, Fury Road' A movie that screams in your face from start to finish...
","It is the loud, crazy, insane, overwhelming, bizarre, grotesque and sickening 'quick cuts' version of the original 'Road Warrior' movie. 'Mad Max, Fury Road' is the 'Road Warrior' for the 21st Century. Will 'Mad Max' be nominated for best picture of the year at Academy Awards time? I hope not. Look, if I was a pure action movie fan, I would give this movie at '10' out of '10' all the way. But I'm not. But you see, I also happen to be an up and coming writer myself (at least I think I am) and I just noticed something. There's no story! There's no plot! Only bizarre and nutty scenes being thrown at you at high speed in your face! Again and again! Isn't that great? Isn't that a movie? You know, 'Mad Max' reminds me of another movie. What movie is that? DUNE! You know, that boring and nonsensical piece of trash directed by David Lynch! Oh, that one! I have concluded that 'Mad Max, Fury Road' is the super high speed version of 'Dune'. Mad Max takes the weirdness and sickness of 'Dune' and accelerates it to 200 miles an hour! 'Hooray!' 'Isn't that a fantastic and original idea?' You know, George Miller, the director of Mad Max, should redo 'Dune' next. I would pay good money to see what George Miller would do to 'Dune'. Or has he done it already? Is 'Mad Max' really 'Dune' in disguise? I have to say, though, 'Mad Max' was very entertaining. But that's it. Without a plot, without a story, all I got was a one dimensional roller coaster ride through hell. And is that what all these violent and crazy movies are good for? Are they just roller coaster rides now? It seems that they are.",3,15,31,4 June 2015
