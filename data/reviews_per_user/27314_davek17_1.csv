Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Loved the movie, HATED Jar Jar Stinks (sorry, Binks)
","Some people might think that having a lesser opinion of this movie all because of Jar Jar is stupid or that it's nitpicking. Well, sorry, but just as good charecters add greatly to the appeal of any story, particularly annoying charecters really do hurt it. I wouldn't have minded if Jar Jar had say only a brief five-minute scene, (which is what I hope happens in Episode II,)or if the other charecters had reacted to him in the same way the charecters in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK reacted to C-3PO, where they're constantly telling him to shut up (which is what I think most audience members would have liked to do,) then I wouldn't have minded to much. Hey, the latter would have made me laugh, which I belive was the intended purpose of the charecter. Anyway, this guy was so irritating, and he appeared consistantly throughout the film, chewing up scenary wherever he went. Lucas said he intended this to be a kids film. Well, the origonal trilogy wasn't. It was equally appealing for anyone from the age of 5 to the age of 80. To single out one age group and say they're the only ones the series needs to entertain is quite simply unfair for all the other fans. I can only pray that Episode II will be much better.",Null,0,1,27 July 2001
