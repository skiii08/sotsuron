The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Great Movie, For What It Is
","OK, let me start by saying that if you go into this movie thinking 'Ugh, this is stupid. Why are they splitting it into two movies?' You aren't going to enjoy this movie no matter how good it is. That being said, I was disappointed that they split the movie. I knew it was a ploy to get money, but I figured that I might as well try and enjoy it. After all, Deathly Hollow was pretty good, so why shouldn't this one be? When I got to the theater, I was shocked at how good the movie was. The camera-work was brilliant. Every frame was beautiful. The acting was absolutely superb. Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss) proved her acting chops in the first five minutes. Francis Lawrence obviously wanted to make up for the studios decision and had everyone step up their game. Even Josh Hucherson (who, let's be honest, is the weakest actor in the bunch) nailed it. That being said, not much happens in this movie. There are a few scenes (the propo scenes, the water dam scene, the last 15 minutes) where action takes place and it is brilliantly done. But most of the movie is politics and character development. If you are in the theater for an action movie, you're gonna be disappointed. I don't think this movie deserves the backlash it is getting. Get angry at the studio, if you must, but don't take it out on the movie itself.",8,15,45,23 November 2014
