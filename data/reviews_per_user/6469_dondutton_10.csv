Walk the Line," Over rated
","Reese Withspoon is great in the film but Joachim Phoenix is just not believable as Johnny Cash - too squat, and no voice. The thing that sold Johhny to Sam Phillips was the voice. Sam would never have signed someone who sounded like Phoenix- good song or not. So he's no Jamie Foxx 'inhabiting ' Ray Charles; or even Val Kilmer being Jim Morrison. He's not the worst actor to play a rock star- that dubious award has to go the Garey Busy for his impersonation of Buddy Holly playing Gary Busey. A second problem; by and large we know the stories of these celebrities already, so dramatic structure takes a beating. Did any one not know that Johnny was saved by his amphetamine addiction by June Carter and that they lived happily ever after. A bit more of Mother Maybelle's character would have been welcome as well.",7,0,4,21 November 2005
Coffee and Cigarettes," boredom disguised as art
","if you can't write clever dialogue but only meaningless and boring droning from empty people, then dress it up as an art film, maybe no one will notice or, better still, they'll read some 'cool' cachet into the dreck that will give it meaning.  there is simply not one person in this film that you would listen to for more than 40 seconds if you were trapped bedside them in a bar.do we need a film on the emptiness of human communication when we can experience it firsthand everyday?  so why pay money for it? I would see only if they paid a standard therapy fee to me ( about $135.00 per hour).Jim Jarmisch should have quit after Down by Law, his only good film. Quentin Tarantino, pay attention, here lies your future and it ain't pretty.",Null,1,2,14 June 2004
Troy," Ho hum Hollywood Big battle Formula #1
","Hollywood can bring anyone down. Even Wolfgang Petersen. Want evidence? Just watch his brilliant Das Boot, one of the most riveting war movies ever made and then watch this piece of Hollywood junk. Big Battle formula #1 calls for pretty faces, blizzard edits of slashing, no gory injuries (superficial slashes are better), wide angle shots of two huge armies running at each other, protagonists who will fight in the last 'meaningful' scene. You've seen it before ad nauseam, here you see it again. Mix in numerous close up of anguished heroines watching the battle and that's about it for this picture. As opposed to Das Boot where the viewer actually comes to care about what is happening, Hollywood Big Battle Formula #1 ensures no more involvement than you would get from your video game. Not a coincidence, that's the audience they had in mind. Too bad the 'creative people' in Hollywood are MBA's.",3,1,9,31 July 2005
Crash," a brilliant look at human folly
","Paul Haggis deserves tons of praise for this gritty Altmanesque masterpiece; truly great writing and insight into tragedy. The film defies the usual ho-hum Hollywood practice of using one dimensional cutouts for characters. In Crash, you may feel you have someone pegged and they they do something that blows your opinion to shreds. The tragedy is usually produced by 'perfect storms': conflations of confusions and misunderstandings. The acting is first rate; Matt Dillon is outstanding, Don Cheadle is great as always. I was surprised that a Canadian wrote the story since it has such a dead- on sense of the US inner city street scene. Paul Haggis deserves serious credit for this one.",10,0,5,12 November 2005
Alien," arguably the most powerful sci-fi film ever
","Alien is a study in how to construct horror and terror on the screen, from the amazing set design (including the Alien itself), to the portentously threatening visuals of the various death scenes, to the ending. Lieutenant Ripley became an icon in this brilliant work of genius by Ridley Scott. Although the theme of a lethal threat in a closed space killing people one by one is not new, is has never been done better than in this truly original film. Even knowing what will happen and having seen the film before, it is still hard to watch in a way that the computer graphic monsters of Jurassic Park are not. I think this the finest sci-fi horror film ever made. It simply raised the genre to another level.",10,2,6,18 June 2005
The Machinist," Guilt is a terrible thing
","If you think lady Macbeth had it bad, what with her compulsive hand washing and all..that was nothing compared to Trevor Reznick. Trevor can't sleep, can't eat apparently (since he is emaciated) and can't figure out who he is. He's spiraling into a paranoid psychosis and you, the viewer get to go along. This would be great double bill with Polanski's Repulsion. Rent them both and invite your friends to a paranoid psychosis double bill. Christian Bale is a wonderful actor, much better than he gets to show in Batman. Jennifer Jason Leigh is always great, brings an incredible dimension to part, witness her in Shortcuts.",9,1,1,26 June 2005
Aliens," inevitable dumbing down
","I see that readers give Alens as high a rating as the original Alien. I found the sequel to be a formulaic 'action thriller', very predictable- the editing blizzards shots- the clash of the main protagonists in the penultimate scene- all right out of the 'action' formula. The Ridley maternal themes were good but there is often a nurturant-rescue subtext in action thrillers. While Alien simply showed you that Ridley was both a woman and a leader, the sequel had to have the gratuitous dialog's scene on the topic for those who didn't get the point. I really felt that Aliens was a dumbeb down version of the original without the true uniqueness of the original. Part of that was the change of directors. James Cameron is no Ridley Scott. Cameron went on to make Titanic which shows his nose for commercialism, Scott made Blade Runner, another true original. Part of it too, is simply using more conventional commercial formulas- action thrillers appeal to the target demographic- young males even if we continue to see the same plot and script with minor alterations for the 100th time.",Null,0,0,19 June 2005
Amadeus," Almost great
","The glaring problem with this movie is Tom Hulse, a good actor but far too American to play Mozart, better suited for an Iowa Marching Band, I think. Mozart should have been played by Kalus Maria Brandauer. Hulse was simply not believable in the part. It amazes me that people get hung up about black actors playing previously white parts (example: Denzel Washington in The Manchurian Candidate) but don't realize that someone can just be too American to play a European or other racial groups. Did you believe Jeff Chandler as Cochise? How about John Wayne as Genghis Khan? Also, from what I've seen the depiction of Mozart as a boor is not historically accurate. Too bad because the theme of Salieri's jealousy is well handled.",Null,2,6,26 July 2004
Mulholland Drive," David Lynch's latest incomprehensible piece
","Although there are some strong and compelling scenes the plot is incomprehensible to intelligent viewers, filled with time distortions,. repetitions and identity switches. One stops caring before the film ends.",Null,0,1,9 August 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Puerile Gorefest
","Now let me get this straight. if you throw in enough references to other films, even shlocky films, your audience will think they're seeing true art. doesn't matter that's its' 90+ minutes of numbing, desensitizing dismemberments. people in this film don't have emotional reactions, they don't have to- they're in a comic book - the mind of Quentin Tarantino - the anime- influenced Nerd with Style. You like this stuff? The Japanese did it for real at Nanking in 1938- played decapitation games with the Chinese civilians. isn't that amusing? It cannot be argued any longer that Tarantino doesn't just throw in spatter for shock value or that he has now run out of headroom. In Reservior Dogs it was just an ear and plenty of shooting - now its' just non-stop carnage without plot, dialogue or character.",1,5,12,23 June 2004
