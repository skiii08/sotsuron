National Treasure: Book of Secrets," More of the good stuff from the first one, unfortunately the flaws from the original are still there too.
","National Treasure 2 is definitely as good as it's predecessor, which can be said about almost no other sequels. Then again, I think the original was entertaining enough but a too clichéd Disney movie. I pretty much feel the same way about this movie. Pretty predictable & clichéd and not that well acted. Maybe I'm just starting to dislike Nicolas Cage after the recent debacles Ghost Rider, Next and The Wicker Man.The riddles were fun and original, but I thought the whole concept of the tour through Europe's and America's touristic sites became a little stupid after a while (just like in the first one). It feels like a lot of the film was just product placement and promotion of tourism. Also, the movie seemed to reek of right wing nationalism...Disney movies are not supposed to be political are they.Another reason why I think the National Treasure movies fail is...the inevitable comparison with the Indiana Jones trilogy, which is in a totally other cinematic class. The film should be compared to films like Indiana Jones and The Da Vinci code since it does borrow a thing or two (understatement). National treasure comes out poorly in the comparisons and therefore is...mediocre.Anyway, I'm nitpicking here. The film does exactly what it's supposed to do...entertain. I do have one advice...watch it in the cinema. It's a popcorn flick that really isn't gonna be the same when you watch it at home. 5.4/10 is a fair score for an entertaining yet flawed movie. I hope people can be fair and not bash my comment, just because I ended up giving it a 5. IMDb points are not like tests results in school, 5 is a score for an average movie, not 7 like a lot of people seem to assume.",5,2,4,12 January 2008
Walk the Line," A Fantastic Movie with 2 Oscar worthy performances.
","What a fantastic movie, a real delight for music fans and fans of period pieces. I'm neither but I gotta say, Walk The Line is a well made movie. Beautiful direction, Oscar worthy performances and a soundtrack that'll get everyone tapping their feet. I especially loved the montages and the transition between scenes. They just made me wild. :-). A lot of people have been comparing this movie to Ray, for understandable reasons. I wouldn't say Ray is necessarily a worse movie than this, but I did like WTL a whole lot better. The story in Ray was all over the place most of the time. Just my 2 cents. I'll leave this comment short and sweet. See this movie, you will not regret it.8.8/10",9,1,1,7 January 2008
Deja Vu," Exciting Thriller !
","Deja Vu is the more than intriguing title that was chosen for Denzel Washington's long anticipated new film. A Deja Vu is a strange phenomenon that modern-day science is yet to sufficiently explain. The simplified definition is 'The sensation you are doing something you have done before.'. You're no wiser now than you were a minute ago when you started reading are you?... I didn't think so :-). If you're hoping to learn more about the story itself I suggest you stop reading this comment immediately because the above is all I'm going to tell you about the story as it is a heavenly delight to watch this film ice cold( the regular IMDb user will know what I mean). Just lay back and you will be blown away by the story.Deja Vu is a fast-paced action thriller that has all the elements to keep you glued to your seat throughout the movie. An a-typical Denzel Washington movie but then again is there such a thing as a typical Denzel Washington movie?! He's played civil war soldiers, police officers, boxers, basket ball players and he manages to make it work every time. This is an intelligent action film( yes, there is such a thing) and will leave some thinking even after the credits have rolled. I know that was the case for yours truly. Don't miss out on this one, see it now because you never know what will happen tomorrow. Denzel Washington is great as always, he doesn't have as much to work with character-wise as in Training Day or The Hurricane but he still makes it work and makes the character 100% believable as he always manages to do. Jim Caviezel is unbelievable in his role. I've seen him in some roles before where I judged him to be average, but this was the firs time I was very impressed by him. ( I must admit I haven't seen him as Christ). The other actors are a bit overshadowed by those 2 amazing actors and deliver just OK performances. Tony Scott does an amazing job directing the film. He applies a very modern style in the camera shots ( frequent use of close-ups and fast paced switching of camera viewpoints), allowing the public to feel the excitement of the scenes. He is very careful not to overdo it, the slower and more intense scenes are given the chance to develop (without too much switching between camera viewpoints) and have the intended effect on the viewer. An example of a film that overdid the fast switching of shots is Smokin' Aces, which made the film very chaotic and sloppy. The pacing of the story itself is masterfully done.Deja Vu is one of 06's best. I haven't been so impressed by a film since I saw The Prestige some time ago. Both these films show that modern films with daring scenarios do have the potential to become classics and that the general film quality is going up despite what some cynics may say.See it yesterday rather than today...?!! :-D",9,4,7,18 June 2007
Unbreakable," A confirmation of Shyamalan's exceptional talent.
","'Unbreakable' is an M. Night Shyamalan (37) film, the born in India, raised in Philadelphia director/scenarist who, back in 1999, scored a world hit totally out of the blue with the marvelous lo fi-horror film 'The Sixth Sense'. And I'm pretty sure about it now, the M stands for magnificent. There are a lot of red threads running through his films; they're all spellbound fairy tales, always beautifully visualized and injected with a religious-philosophical message and the most prominent feature: a trademark plot twist that'll drop your jaw like a drafty shed door during a heavy thunderstorm.His films are so very intelligently written; they never are what they appear to be at first sight. 'The Village' has the look of a mystery/horror but peel away that first layer and what you get is actually a quite beautiful love story. Less skilled directors would've surely taken Unbreakable's premise and cheapened it to action-movie formulary banality but Shymalan carefully shapes it into an impressive character-drama. Contrary to popular opinion, his work does not rely solely on spectacular plot twists. In fact most of his movies are just as good without the end twist. But it is the cherry on top. Shyamalan reminds me of Fincher in that perspective even though Fincher's movies are still a class higher obviously.'Unbreakable' is definitely the one in Shyamalan's oeuvre that shares the most elements with 'The Sixth Sense': the same lead actor (Bruce Willis), the same down-putting atmosphere, again a supernatural story,and again a late surprising plot twist. Some folks will, for that reason, undoubtedly claim that Shyamalan just repeated his success hit, but that statement is about as absurd as 'Pulp Fiction' allegedly being a watered down version of 'Reservoir Dogs'. 'Unbreakable' is on the contrary a mighty confirmation of Shyamalan's exceptional skill.To reveal much of the story is forbidden. An again very timidly acting Willis portrays David Dunn, a somewhat troubled security guard who solely - and without a scratch or bruise - survives a horrible train wreck. The commencement is not unlike 'Fearless' (where Jeff Bridges walks away unharmed from a plane crash), but from the moment Samuel L. Jackson's character is introduced - as the mysterious man who has a very peculiar explanation for David's alleged unbreakable ability - 'Unbreakable' sails in a totally different, more supernatural, direction. The plot itself barely rises above the better-than-average comic book actually, but visually 'Unbreakable' has a lot in common with the looks of an European art-film: just like in 'The Sixth Sense' Shyamalan refrains from showy action, stunts or effects - we're even denied the train crash - but he spellbinds the audience with unusually long, uncut scenes, a dark color pallet, and a unconventionally slow pace, - all very un-Hollywoodian means that provide 'Unbreakable' with the allure of a metaphysic perilous-predestination drama. If Ingmar Bergman would have directed 'X-men', than this is about the result we'd get (the dispiriting confrontations between David and his other half wouldn't be misplaced in Bergmans' 'Scenes from a Marriage' nota bene).And even though Shyamalan's scenario is glitched this time around (it's rather unbelievable that David can't remember whether he's ever fallen ill)), I still can't be anything else than deeply impressed by his mastership: when David hangs up his guard jacket (brilliant scene!) you realize in a flash that the cineaste has always stayed one step ahead of you, that every detail checks out and all the pieces of the puzzle fall into place majestically. Unbreakable class!",9,0,0,27 March 2008
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," The best comedy of the year: smart humor in a story with substance.
","In 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' 'How I Met Your Mother's Jason Segel plays Peter Bretter, a man-child musician who's entire existence is overshadowed by his successful actress girlfriend, Sarah Marshall. She's egocentric, possessive and emotionally unavailable but naive Peter somehow oversees that, and when she dumps him codependent Peter's heart is left to shreds. Enter Brian, his brother-in-law who aids Peter in his quest to 'forget' Sarah Marshall. Well, he tries anyway. Little does he know when he advices Peter to take a trip to Hawaï, Sarah's there too. And with a new boyfriend from hell, bold rocker Aldous Snow (portrayed by British comedian Russell Brand)...The plot's a lot more than just a clothe hanger for jokes, in this film the interactions between the characters really captured my interest. Admittatly the usual generic jokes that come with a situation like this do occur, the plot takes surprising twists which open up doors for original humor and engrossing scenes. It's sometimes tough seeing Peter get so easily manipulated and his feelings toyed with by his ex. It's though to let go, even if you know it's the right thing to do, so I'm sure many of us understand the fiber of the story. The movie's not at all that dramatic as I may have led you to believe though, it's genuinely funny in conventional ways as well as weird ways. Plenty of absurd figures come marching by, Paul Rudd plays a totally 'cool' surf instructor who seems to have a very loose connection with reality. In one scene he 'philosophises' with Peter out in the water: 'if you get bitten by a shark, you're not just gonna give up surfing, are you?' Peter, who doesn't really get him and neither does anyone else, replies (dry): '...yeah, probably'. Then there's the puppet lovin' bartender, the prude Christian on his honeymoon who gets a lot of laughs with one liners such as 'Let me just say that if God was a city planner he would not put a playground next to a sewage system!' and I'm sure I'm forgetting a few memorable side characters.During the second half, the laughs are dialed down a bit to make room for some pivotal scenes that are nicely handled by first time screenwriter Jason Segel. Despite Segel's involvement, FSM still screams Judd Apatow and the formula might get old soon if he doesn't move some stuff around in his next feature. It's hard to rank up FSM with 'Knocked Up', 'Superbad' or 'the 40 Year Old Virgin', most likely it depends from person to person because they all contain a lot of quality material. Neither of them is very easy on it's main protagonist, which is a nice change from the rest of comedies with substance but it does leave that sweet/sour taste in our mouths. All things considered FSM is the sweetest story out of the 4 and the most conventional, it'll not rank the highest in the esteem of hardcore Apatow fans but the direct opposite is true for those who aren't big fans of the man and his colleagues. FSM will appeal to a lot of folks and it'll hopefully end up on a lot of 'favorite comedy' short lists by the end of the year, I know it'll be on mine!",8,2,9,11 August 2008
Cloverfield," Intense.
","'Cloverfield' isn't a movie you can persuade people to love. There are no real arguments as to why it was so good for me. I guess it's just an experience, either you feel the movie or you don't at all.This comparison has been done a million times but I'm going to bring it up again...it's not (at all) like The Blair Witch Project or Godzilla. A movie is more than just the main plot outline or the camera technique used. For me, Cloverfield is simply a great movie-going experience, it's best seen in the theater and in the company of people who know how to keep their mouths shut during an intense movie.The use of (relatively) unknown actors was a brilliant move, it contributed a great deal to the reality factor and the high shock/scare factor that accompanies it. The use of a home-cam isn't 100% original of course and neither is the idea for the story outline itself but does it really matter for a movie as hypnotizing as this? Some scenes had me literally on the edge of my seat, biting my nails and pulling my hair. I'm a pretty easy empathizer but still...not a great deal of movies have this extreme effect on me. This is partly the cast's credit, who all did a good to even fantastic job. Of course, a role like this is a dream for an actor, you really can go all-out (explore the extreme emotional side of your persona) in movies filled with extreme crisis-situations like this. Especially the guy who played the lead-character came off very natural to me, both during the relaxed opening scenes and the unnerving ones.You might not agree with me, but even the haters have to realize what a great breath of fresh air this movie is compared to a lot of Hollywood movies coming out recently. There have been a lot of great ones this year, I'm not complaining, but I can only think of two movies that really where special (NCFOM and this one).Finally, the question that plays in everyone's head...did it live up to the hype? In my opinion...most definitely. You may not like it but I'd strongly advise everyone to check out the movie, you may end up loving it to death...7.6/10",8,1,4,31 January 2008
Snatch," This is how good comedy can be !!
","There's not really much to say about the technicalities of 'Snatch'. Pretty standard direction and other production values, the acting's good but nothing Oscar worthy (Pitt is awesome make no mistake about it).The fact is...in my opinion 'Snatch' is definitely one of the funniest movies of the last decade. It's all very much an acquired taste of course...the British humor of Guy Ritchie might not be understood by anyone. I've never been a fan of American comedy so 'Snatch' was definitely a welcome change for me ...a comedy that actually had me laughing the whole time...The story is very ingenious, the jokes are original and the delivery is very good. Brad Pitt proves his versatility, he's just as good playing a high-class guy as he is playing a madman (see 12 Monkeys for example). To sum it up: everyone should give the movie a chance, if you don't like it you will know right away and if you do like it...definitely see 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' too. Same director, 'Snatch' is a little better but both are brill...",9,0,1,8 June 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Sweeney Todd
","I do not hold the opinion that only fans' or experts' views count, Tim Burton is an acquired taste and it will never be mine. Often appraised as an original and revolutionary filmmaker, he always creates a slight variation of his dark Gothic fantasy world, nothing more.Truly innovative directors are able to succeed in many genres with bravura, Mr. Burton does not. And for that reason he is not yet among the great directors such as De Palma, Stone, Coppola, and the other legends.Sweeney Todd is a dark comedy/musical with a Depp in the form of his life. He is Sweeney Todd and rightly won the Golden Globe for it. Of course the whole looks attractive, the set designs are wonderful and the cinematographer deserves mention too, but it simply bored me out of my mind. I simply don't see how it's possible to mess up such a great concept, Johnny Depp as a throat-slicing vengeful barber, whose victims are then baked into pies, each profession apparently having a different flavor. Sounds sensational, but every time the actors opened their mouths to heave another badly chanted song, I was ashamed in place of the actors. Sure, the lyrics were cute but every time a song began it took me out of the hypnosis of the story, and it was very funny (unintentionally unfortunately).To be fair I never have and never will like musicals. It doesn't help that Depp hasn't got any more talent than the average American Idol contestant. Even the deliciously dark humor couldn't save the movie, it bored me out of my mind and though it wasn't the train wreck I anticipated, it's pretty disappointing. The film just loses me after the first act, there's a lot of repetition and the story felt uninspired and in the end it was...predictable. For the final plot twists to be surprising, they shouldn't have covered up the 'old' woman's face so excessively.I'm beginning to lose hope of Burton every being up to the task of outdoing his best movie so far, Big Fish. A movie which I just ate up, it's sad an obvious talented director since then hasn't created anything remotely as good...5.6/10",6,2,4,15 March 2008
The Bourne Ultimatum," Best 'Bourne' concludes an already legendary trilogy. Best action movie of the year.
","We had to wait twelve years after the Die Hard Trilogy but once again has a great action trilogy been made. To anyone who doesn't believe this movie deserves it's Top 250 spot, think of it this way: The Bourne Ultimatum is a representative of the whole trilogy and as the best of the trilogy, deserves it's spot. I truly believe it's unique for a third installment to be better then the first or second one. In fact I would go so far as saying the first one is the worst of the series, even though I love it to death. Matt Damon gets his chance to shine once again and I'm really happy he's finally getting recognition. He's a great actor and a lot of his films are worth seeing. The Bourne Ultimatum is a must for action movie fans. It's the year's best ( of the action genre) even though I enjoyed the controversial Die Hard 4.0 too. 300 rates better on CGI but both Die Hard 4.0 and 300 are seriously lacking intelligence compared to TBU. I hope they don't do a fourth, the trilogy is too legendary already to ruin with an uninspired and unnecessary sequel.The Bourne Ultimatum is Paul Greengrass' best and I really hope it remains in the top 250 even after the hype passes. Overall impression: phenomenal.",9,2,4,15 September 2007
28 Weeks Later," Surprisingly good
","I had no intention in watching a sequel of the Danny Boyle classic. I thought, as so many sequels, 28 Weeks Later would be cursed from the start. The viewing of the stinker 'The Hills Have Eyes 2' made my preconceptions only stronger. Boy, was I wrong...28 Weeks Later is an exciting mix of horror(gore) and action that will please fans of the genre. It's at no time as good as 28 Days Later although the action scenes are more spectacular at times. I was surprised to see the excellent Rose Byrne turn up in this and some other solid actors. Of course the story is improbable, of course the action is over-the-top, of course the acting is ridiculous at times, of course there's no character development...nevertheless it's a movie that will have you jumping out of your seat and that's exactly what it's intended for. The gore is excessive ( much more than in 28 Days Later) and I couldn't help but look away in one scene.28 Weeks Later biggest flaw is the lack of dramatic intensity, no philosophical content and of course many, many plot holes. Do not try to compare it to it's predecessor, as that one manages to score a lot better on the above mentioned points. At what points is 28 Weeks Later better then 28DL? The action-scenes are downright spectacular, also the originality of the action-scenes deserves to be praised. The camera-work is excellent, contributing to the choking atmosphere throughout the movie. To sum up: 28 Weeks later is a great summer action/horror movie, that will definitely satisfy fans of the genre.",7,1,4,27 July 2007
Armageddon," A Pure Adrenaline Rush !
","Armageddon was my number one favorite film with a bullet, when I was a little boy. It was the most spectacular film I'd ever seen and it still is one of the most spectacular to ever come out. Is it a masterpiece? Yes and no. You can't compare it with mind-enriching pieces of cinematic art like Fight Club or Requiem For A Dream but it does stand out in the, relatively mindless, action genre. It does everything what an action film is required to do and more. And therefore it's an action masterpiece. It's also Michael Bay's best, though Bad Boy is my favorite Bay movie.Armageddon gives you the two-hour adrenaline rush that you wanted when walking into the theater to go see an action flick. The acting and script is definitely extraordinary for an action movie. Okay, it's not excellent but it's better than 75% of all action movies that come out, even to this day. Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Buscemi in particular did a great job and this movie wouldn't have been the same without them.I'm not going to reveal anything about the plot since I don't want to include any spoilers in my comment. I think the film truly deserves the 8 that I'm giving it, even though it's hard to compare action films with films of an other genre.",7,5,10,9 December 2007
The Village," One of Shyamalan's great 3
","I've seen The Village three times already and I'll probably see it many times more in the future. What makes this film so strong is the incredible music, photography and the acting. As mentioned by many people before me, the young Bryce Dallas Howard is sensational. Joaquin Phoenix and William Hurt are good as always while the rest of the cast is appropriately bleach. The stars are given the room to shine and shine they do.As for the score, I think it's one of the finest ones ever to not win the Academy Award. Intense where it has to and subtle where it has to, James Newton-Howard does a tremendous job. Some of the strongest scenes however are silent ones. It's M.Night's credit that he doesn't feel forced to fill every second of the movie with music and effects. This is a mistake that is made in a great deal of movies, The Hours to name just one example.There's more than a score required to create an atmosphere. The cinematography and photography has to be top notch as well and in The Village, it is. The locations are beautiful and even though one can argue that woods already have a certain atmosphere, that it's not the Directors credit's...I believe they really made the most of the available locations. It's a fine art to do so.Now let's talk about the plot a little bit. It's a fairly simple premise but the story takes many twists and turns further on the road and in the end it satisfies. Semi-open endings are often the most powerful and intelligent ones, and I think this one is a prime example. If they would have tied all the lose ends then this movie wouldn't have been half as memorable. M.Night gets his audience thinking and leaves him feeling confused, excited, happy and sad at the same time. What more can you ask of an ending? Many people feel the Twist (even though there are actually 3 twists, there's only one with a capital T) came too early. While I can understand this impulse to think so, I feel the revelation early in the movie made the rest of the movie more interesting. The suspension wasn't gone, but merely replaced with a different kind of suspension. If the revelation would've been made in the end, like it could've been, it would have been too similar to The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable and as it is now...it's something special. Too bad not many people realize just how good this movie is. I hope it'll later be remembered as a misunderstood work of fine art, instead of a failed horror movie. It isn't a horror movie, it never tries to be, and the trailer is misleading. It's a well-made trailer, it got many people drawn to the theater, so from a business perspective it serves it's purpose. From an artistic point of view, the trailer is shamefully bad. Please don't go see the movie expecting it to be just another suspense horror movie. It's so much more.Everyone should see it at least once. You may hate it, but you should give it 1 try because you just might find yourself moved by this fine film. And that's about the highest thing that 'just a movie' can achieve.",9,0,3,12 December 2007
The Butterfly Effect," 'I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.'
","The Butterfly Effect is a sci-fi thriller that centers around four childhood friends: Evan, Kayleigh (the girl he secretly loves), Tommy (her jealous, violent brother) and Lenny (an overly shy, slightly mentally unstable kid). The four kids encounter a series of traumatic, life determent/changing events together. Evan, the son of a mental patient, has blackouts chronically and he has suppressed all those traumatic events, until one day (fourteen years later) he reads one of his old journals. He discovers he can go back in time and tries to right the wrongs of the past but every time he tries to do so he ends up making it worse. Nothing goes as planned and the actions he undertakes in the past (how slight they may seem) have grave consequences in the present Whilst being obviously plot-driven, the acting wasn't too shabby either. I can appreciate Ashton Kutcher's comedy roles but assessing his career at the moment, I think he desperately needs to get back into more serious roles. He's good, probably never will be Oscar-good, but still. Knowing Melora Walter's phenomenal tour-de-force in 'Magnolia', she's a tad under performing in TBE. There really can't be any complaining about the any of the 'flashback' casts either, especially teenage Evan left an impression. When youngest Evan started talking trash I admit to having trouble taking him seriously and repressed a laugh out loud. Paired with this is the more than solid and mention-worthy soundtrack, a good mix between sounds (like the flutter of a butterfly's wings theme) and songs (like Oasis' Stop Crying Your Heart Out at the end) to create the appropriate atmosphere for the kind of cool, fast-moving thriller TBE is. The visual look: blue tones dominating, modern, accentuates the cool vibe even further. Timetravel films form a tricky business. This amazing ability provides the protagonist unavoidably with tremendous power, which in turn can take all of the tension out of the story. In order for us to be biting our nails during a film, we have to think that there's no way out of the box, and so the screenwriters need to think out of the box. The concept of the 'butterfly effect', where all changes in the past directly and substantially affect not only your own but everyone's future is very useful. Not only does Evan have to battle his present obstacles, but also his past ones. The fact that you can't see the events the first time (because he blacks them out) also keeps you eagerly awaiting and guessing.In 'The Butterfly Effect' we get dragged into a whirlpool of plot lines and characters ever changing with each 'trip', which provides potential for confusion. However, in order to counteract this the writers often verbalize plot points or thoughts: we see Evan talking to himself after he discovers his mother's lung cancer 'You started chain smoking after I blew myself up.' followed by 'If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never would've started smoking in the first place.' That kind of dialog rubs me the wrong way, we hear the wheels of the plot turning more often than we should...but on the other hand I realize it's a movie developed for a broad audience.Some segments captured my interest less than others, the whole 'prison' storyline clearly being the weakest although I do see the motivation for putting it in the script. It's the only time (except for the beginning/ending) where he's literally cornered himself. The greatest parts involved a dramatic explosives incident, the outcome of which reverberated well into the future and it clearly held the key to 'making everything perfect again' ( JASON: You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother. EVAN Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.) A real surprise here when all of a sudden - just when you think you figured out how far the scriptwriters were willing to go drama-wise - we see Evan without arms. The movie becomes darker and darker, the greater his actions in the past the graver the consequences in the present/future, and the happy end thus came as a surprise to me. They had to stretch believability (home movies have the same effect as journals?) and undermine their own philosophical/moral lessons that have been laid out throughout the movie for it. The movie is quite dark and cynical (you can't play God!) and the ending is totally the opposite. Reading about the director's cut, it sounded more logical to me. Nevertheless, I'm fond of the original ending...because I didn't see it coming. A fun, cool thriller I recommend to lots of people. 8/10",8,0,1,6 September 2008
Revolutionary Road," Uneven melodrama with terrific performances.
","Revolutionary Road features such astonishing acting that you almost forget to keep your critical eye focused on the film as a whole. I have to begrudgingly conclude that Mendes' work fails to break a whole lot of new ground. The comparison with American Beauty isn't completely fair since there's a fifty year gap between both, that's especially important for the concept of 'the American dream' and the role of women in society. April's ache stems partly from her obligation to be a housewife. 'The American dream' in the 1950's seems to consist mainly of martini lunches, monkey suits and 'darling' houses on wide avenues. In American Beauty, the same goes for Carolyn's version, but Lester considers juvenile values holy, the laws of rebellion, freedom, rock'n'roll and recreational drugs. Both of Mendes' films are poignant but unquestionably Revolutionary Road isn't half as relevant as American Beauty. Mendes' work isn't diminishing in quality, but it is stagnating. RR definitely outranks the passable Road To Perdition but never outclasses American Beauty, except maybe for the astonishing confrontation where Di Caprio's freak out made my heart stop for about half a minute. I believe it's only fair to hold every new film up to the light of an artist's best work. He does seem very skilled at bringing out the very best out of his cast, Di Caprio, Shannon and foremost Winslet impress . Especially the scenes where she lashes out at Frank are great, those wide, ruthless eyes are really against her natural acting style of more warm, genial characters. The scenes with John Givings were subtle (and welcome) comic relief from the constant tension between the couple, and his observations helped the audience understand the relationship better. The dialog did well in cutting to the chase without being too theatrical. David Harbour performed admirably but neither his side character nor any of the others worked for me. They're purposely over the top and clichéd, which worked much better in the black comedy of American Beauty then it does in this serious drama.Another problem for me: the lack of ambiguity. I realize April has an unstable nature, but she is by no means bipolar. She was right in all arguments, though her obvious flaw is the cowardice of avoiding confrontation( which destroys a marriage in the long run). I suspect the film's intention was to spark dialog, as in: some agree with Frank, others with April. I did not feel it reached that goal at all. For a movie dealing with such a poignant moral problem, it should have been less black and white. The plot was by no means completely predictable, but I knew from the instant they talked about going to Paris that he would get an opportunity at work and that she would get pregnant. I wouldn't dare claim I guessed how the third act would play out, I'll be honest, that shocked me. The characters were so unlikeable, it felt like watching a Neil LaBute movie sometimes. April had some admirable qualities but I only felt sorry for Frank and the other characters caught in suburban hell. Maybe they should have granted us one or two scenes in between the meeting of Frank and April and the play, scenes of a happy marriage. I desperately wanted to empathize with the characters but had a hard time doing so. Another problem with the story for me, was the expected heavy drama at the end. The movie would have done just fine without the tacked on ending, cutting right after the breakfast scene.All things considered, Revolutionary Road means a step in the right direction for director Mendes, and a confirmation of his exceptional talent, but it's not the timeless classic American Beauty is and I hope the director can live up to his dwarfing theatrical debut someday.",7,1,2,29 January 2009
The Number 23," A story of obsession
","I often find ( to my own disgust) I agree with most film critics' reviews. Perfect Stranger is a prime example. All the horrible things that were said about this film are true. I literally mean all of them. However...The Number 23 is a fine film. The film critics got it all wrong.The Number 23, a story of obsession. Obsession with The Number 23, with death, with sex, with the past...It's a film about a paranoid man ( or is he right on the money?).It dares to ask us some philosophical questions: Does fate exist and are we bound to it? Are we responsible for our own choices or is a larger force at work? Can a man really change?. TN 23 asks us all those questions but doesn't go far enough. Unfortunately it stays pretty much on the surface most of the time. I wonder if Joel would have made a more daring film if he wasn't bound to some Hollywood censorship. The Number 23 isn't' what it seems: The whole numerology and paranoia storyline is just a tool to tell a completely different story. A much more interesting story that I will not unveil any further as it would be blasphemous...I was a little disappointed to see another plot-driven film with a surprise ending. A film can be excellent without the often unnecessary twist ending. Also, the viewers will probably always associate the film with the ending and that's the only part that will be remembered. The twist wasn't that surprising either and it certainly was one of the most predictable and less ingenious plot twists. The best recent ones still remain Skeleton Key and The Sixth Sense ( ah also Lucky Number Slevin). Jim Carrey does a good job although I was never truly blown away by his performance. He does, however, confirm his great performance in ESOTSM and proves he can be taken serious as a drama actor. The other actors were very mediocre, no real highs or lows. The director applies his own style and we can definitely see Joel's trademarks once again. Certainly not Joel's best film but a nice one to add to his portfolio.The Number 23 is one of the few interesting films the year 2007 has produced and is definitely worth a look. Don't expect a masterpiece, because it has quite a lot of flaws, but try to start the film objectively and you will have a good time.7.2/10",8,1,2,17 July 2007
Good Will Hunting," Moving film with a great script and outstanding performances by Damon and Williams.
","Will Hunting is part of the elite of the intellectual class: a true genius. He's one of those people who can go from step A to step C without even having to bother with step B. Unfortunately for Will, he's also just a janitor. Not having had the privilege of the right education, he struggles to get by in life, even with his intellectual potential. Growing up as an orphan and raised in the lower class neighborhood, he has a lot of issues which cause him to have a violent and rebellious nature. The story of 'Good Will Hunting' begins when Will is discovered by a prestigious Math Professor at the Harvard University. He promises to work with Will if he in turn goes to see a psychiatrist every week to help him with his problems. We see how everyone deals with the changes in Will's life and how this affects Will himself. Will he be a blatant success? Or will his rebellious nature and his internal struggle keep him from reaching his potential?This is pretty much the main storyline. What makes GWH so good is that there are also a lot of smaller plot lines that are almost as interesting to follow. They are well written and never feel like filler (they do in a lot of other movies). What everyone probably knows is that this film was written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck themselves. I always found it odd that two people who are (I assume) unexperienced writers can come up with such a wonderful, fresh and well constructed script. When there are so many full-time writers out there who are not able to produce a decent script. Anyway, Matt and Ben got the Oscar for the script and they deserved it too. It's one of my favorite scripts of the nineties and that was a great decade for movies.Now enough about the script. How about the performances, you say. Well, they are great. Robin Williams gives (maybe) his best performance ever and Matt Damon is also very memorable. I still think his performances in The Talented Mr. Ripley was better, but this is a close second. Minnie Driver was also good, as she usually is. Ben Affleck and the rest of the cast deliver a decent performances. He has failed to impress me even a single time I'm afraid.Besides the acting and the script, there were several other things that stood out for me. The music for instance. No big theatrical things but sober and modest. It fitted very well with the overall tone of the film.As for it's ranking on IMDb. Why is it not in the top 250? It should be. I hope it will soon take his righteous position back.9.1/10",9,2,6,25 December 2007
I Am Legend," Apocalyptic Poetry
","In the past few years a handful of cineasts has tried in vain to put together a new adaptation of 'I Am Legend', the renowned Richard Matheson science-fiction novel dating from 1954 (the latest version came out quite some time ago, the 1971 Charlton Heston flick 'The Omega Man').In the nineties, Ridley Scott and Arnold Schwarzenegger were eager to begin on the project, but the costs shot up and the studio decided to pull the plug. And Michael Bay also didn't succeed - Thank God!- to drum up the required support.Eventually, Warner Brothers gave director Francis Lawrence ('Constantine') and actor Will Smith the long anticipated green light, something that didn't exactly made me rapturous - all I can remember from 'Constantine' is Keanu Reeves' laughable performance while Smith's 'Independence Day', even though it's a guilty pleasure of mine, was a grade A example of poorly balanced use of special effects (too much) and a neglected script.But what'd you know: 'I Am Legend', by the actor totally accurately defined as an 'artistic character drama disguised as a blockbuster' is pretty strong stuff. Smith is truly tremendous as Robert Neville, a scientist who as the only person on earth stayed immune from an evil virus. In the daytime he wonders the streets of the fully extinct Manhatton terribly alone - you could even call the the film a One-Act film - and in the nighttime he entrenches in his with food cans and sad souvenirs stuffed flat, where he begins to show alarming (and brilliantly acted) symptoms of pinching loneliness: the scene where Neville, as if under hypnosis, is dubbing 'Shrek' is downright creepy. Not to mention the heartbreaking 'please say hello to me' scene. The film clearly shows it has a backbone.The images of the Manhattan re-won by nature (wild deers on Times Square!) look both hallucinating and unearthly beautiful. To end up with this effect - will our cities réally look like that in the future - as a director you need not only an astronomic budget and a large digital magic box but also a good traffic officer (some avenues were, to the rage of the New Yorkers, closed off for hours) and a certain touch for apocalyptic poetry.And, last but not least, I can't forget to mention this: the 'Dark Seekers' who appear quite literally like ghosts in the night and make Neville's life a living hell, really breath out an atmosphere of genuine threat. Unlike the creatures in almost all sci-fi films who appear comical and plain ridiculous. The film also avoids all other common mistakes of these kinds of film. 1) Logic: The hero isn't an all powerful mindless no-neck. He doesn't go out to destroy all the creatures but has a natural reaction which is...avoiding them at all costs. 2) No overkill: the audience isn't drowned in a sea of special effects. Almost all sci-fi movies make the mistake of overusing their digital magic. The story remains central in the film. A great big plus. 3) Well acted: other sci-fi movies (again I'm labeling it sci-fi, while it is clearly a multi-genre film. Sci-fi is just one of the genres) tend to squander money on special effects meanwhile neglecting the casting.This multi-genre film that is really thé ultimate adaptation of the Richard Matheson novel, is an incredible movie experience. It'll scare and sadden you but will also most definitely amuse and touch you. Put it at the top of your to-see list.9.1/10",9,1,3,12 January 2008
Gran Torino," Less impressive than 'Changeling' but it has the heart in the right place.
","Clint Eastwood's thinking about anything but retirement as he released no less than two movies this year. It's rumored that this will be his swan song when it comes to acting. And he's very good in a role that brings back memories of his past famous characters, most distinctively 'Dirty Harry'. The film's equipped with yet another heartbreaking, beautiful score and quality songs (golden globe nomination already in the bag), again an own composition from the hands of Clint and son Kyle.The movie itself definitely lacks ambition and the narrative sort of strolls along a lot of the time, I'm not too crazy about the overdose of moralistic lessons either. Especially the religious theme I couldn't stand. The movie opens when Walt Kowalski's wife passes, and he's left to live alone in his neighborhood, a part of town ridden with immigrants. He forms an unusual friendship with a local Asian-American boy, he becomes the boy's mentor and teaches him about manhood and the importance of hard work.The movie's sweet, but almost sickly so, which annoys a lot of movie fans, who are usually a darker kind of people. Never the less, the movie's features a great soulful Eastwood and an uplifting message. Don't be surprised if you catch yourself chuckling once in a while too, some of the dialog hits your funny bone, luckily it's intended that way.Oh and remember, a racist character never ever means a racist movie, quite the contrary.7.5/10",7,6,37,13 December 2008
The Insider," a thinking man's thriller.
","I've recently became a big Michael Mann fan and started watching his filmography. I saw the fantastic 'Manhunter' last week and this week I picked out 'The Insider'. Even though Mann puts a lot of variety in his work, this was still an a-typical film for him. No trademark Michael Mann shootings or chase-scenes but great acting, great dialog, a great script and great music. Based on true events but slightly altered for dramatic reasons, The Insider is a top notch thinking man's thriller. Pacino in one of his best roles of the '90s, Russell Crowe in his best role ever and a supporting cast to match. Christopher Plummer (!),Philip Baker, HallBruce McGill,...the list of fine actors goes on and on.A must see if you like intelligent political thrillers with fine acting.",9,1,2,8 January 2008
The Dark Knight," Unforgettable Masterpiece.
","'The Dark Knight'...the first title of a Batman-film without the actual name of our beloved hero. Even though this masterpiece is wrongfully titled after the masked crime fighter's nickname, the whole movie revolves around it's villains: Harvey 'Two Face' Dent (portrayed skilfully by Aaron Eckhart) and 'The Joker' (who has no known name other than his alias). The first task of the special effects and make-up department: make the villains look menacing. 'Two Face's visage's heavily disfigured by a burn wound, the wound looks like it's only just stopped smoking a second before we lay eyes on it, Dent's stare is unsettling as he's forever horribly grinning. Quite an other approach than the unintentionally funny melted plastic mask of Tommy Lee Jones.Director Nolan (The Prestige, Memento) plays out his trump cards optimally by not overexposing him on the screen, Heat (well, the joker actually, Heat ceased to exist as he made himself vanish into thin air, the ultimate method actor) steals the whole film, he stares right into your soul and describes the ugliness he sees in all of humanity (it's unpleasantly accurate) - it's hard to describe exactly how he accomplishes that, as I said before countless times, excellence is hard to describe - his madness crawls under your skin so deeply, you never doubt for a second the authenticity of this dangerous mad man. He's a sadist through and through, one that appears to need others' pain and suffering like oxygen.'I had a vision, of a world without Batman. The mob ground out a little profit and the police tried to shut them down, one block at a time. And it was so... boring.' (Joker about Batman) 'You are just a freak, like me!' (Joker to Batman) A strange relationship comes to be between the arch rivals. Not necessarily one of mutual respect but of understanding, banished out of a normal life, called 'freaks' by citizens, the need to keep each other alive is almost as great as the one to annihilate each other.Every single little detail of Ledger's portrayal works, the nervous ticks (the smacking of the lips), the way he growls and bites (the last syllable) of his words, that bone chilling high pitched giggle. One of the absolute highlights - a stroke of genius - is the scene where a fake Batman's tortured by 'The Joker', Ledger doesn't even come into frame, solely the sound of his voice manages to send shivers down my spine. Absolutely terrifying and deeply disturbing. This masterful eye for detail achieves that 'The Joker' becomes more than merely the sum of his parts. It's not so much his weapons that provide him with great power but his mind games, we witness as he manipulates Batman and Dent by beleaguering them, and succeeds in pulling them down to his low morality level, it's fascinating to see the evolution of the characters. His madness lingers throughout the whole film, even in scenes where he's absent, we descent deeper and deeper into the darkness to end up at a scene beyond brilliance: the disorientating (the whole film the camera movements scream 'chaos!!!') 180 degrees camera movement of Nolan when 'The Joker' dangles upside down out the window of a skyscraper, and then that evil, demon laugh resounding into the night air, psyching out every single member in the audience.The Dark Knight's an experience beyond cinema.",10,2,6,15 November 2008
Into the Wild," No longer to be poisoned by civilization, he flees, and walks alone upon the land to become lost in the wild.
","I've been anticipating this movie ever since laying eyes on the trailer, late November 2007. I'm a bit saddened by the knowledge of how insanely beautiful the nature scenes would have looked in the theater, the DVD experience is never the same at all. Now, let's get to it. 'Into The Wild' stirred up a lot of buzz being a Sean Penn direction and being based on the best selling amazing story of Christopher McCandless. I can't say I've had the pleasure of reading the novel, but a lot of comments deem to conclude Penn has done the book justice. The first thing that's poignant about ITW is the narrative. Penn makes jumps in time and place, giving the story more variation and creating intrigue. It doesn't make it easier to follow, however ITW was never intended for a non-attentive audience. People who can't keep an open mind and identify or at least empathize with characters will not fully enjoy the experience (a word I don't use lightly) that is ITW.Besides the writing, there's lots of other stuff to rave about. The music and the performances come to mind. Eddie Vedder was not the reason I urged to see this, but it was, not a doubt in the world about this, a nice bonus for me. He's the vocalizer of my favorite songs and the perfect voice to guide the audience in this unique road movie. He also adds to the filmmakers' credibility, having strong political opinions ,similar to McCandless',of his own.One glance at the cast should get every pure bred movie lover's heart thumping, William Hurt, Hal Holbrook, Marcia Gay Harden,... Not only did the big names deliver, but the small names almost all surprised me with great to excellent performances. Even down to Brian Dierker, who isn't really an actor! Emile Hirsh, only seen in The Girl Next Door, a film I'm not proud of having seen. His performance in that movie belies his abilities. Even in interviews he comes across as a slick Hollywood run-in-a-mill actor, but his performance really radiates feelings of sincerity and dedication to his work. Another nice surprise was Vince Vaughn, he gives the audience a wonderfully natural performance, easily his best one to this day. Can't forget Catherine Keener, always solid, sometimes excellent. The latter applies for this movie, maybe an Oscar nudge wouldn't have been totally out of place here.ITW is a movie that keeps on giving, as you may have concluded from the size of my review. It's filled with little bonuses. The dialog is not the usual Hollywood pretentious drivel. Some of the philosophies brought forward actually ring true in my ears, something which can't be said about most movies with 'clever' (sarcasm) dialog. One of the nicest things about ITW (I can't believe I didn't mention it already) is the feeling you're watching a lot of different wonderful movies, all wrapped up into one (not overly long) movie. Each segment has their own curious and wonderful characters, but the movie manages never to become chaotic. And that alone is a testament to Sean Penn.About the plot/story: I was happy to know it was biographical beforehand, otherwise some of the events may have seemed to 'out-there', far fetched. And that, I believe, is a testament the real story, the level of amazement it actually offers.As said in an interview by Emile Hirsh himself, the character really is a dividing line audience-wise. Hate him or love him, you have to respect a good film like this one. Extremely Highly recommended, especially for those who loved Eternal Sunshine.",10,2,6,3 February 2008
Mission: Impossible," Cool, classy and fun spy thriller with great direction by De Palma and a killer soundtrack.
","'Mission Impossible', based on the eighties TV format with the same name, is as classy and fun as spy-thrillers get. It's filled with enough twists and turns to make your head spin and the acting is more than solid overall, a common complaint when dealing with action-movies. Back in 1996 it was a huge hit and it's no surprise shortly after life was given to a sequel, the unfortunate MI2, perhaps the biggest mistake was leaving the project in the incompetent hands of John Woo. Slow motion and unrealistic fight sequences reign, and there's little left of the fun that made the first film so good. The third film wasn't a complete miss, the producers smart enough to hire a competent director and cast (the outstanding Philip Seymour Hoffman as the villain and an underused Laurence Fishburn).The first one in the series however is a glorious success on every level; on top of the clever plot we have a great soundtrack to support it and director De Palma has some very nice cinematographic tricks up his sleeve. I distinctly remember the great camera-work in the first action sequence (the set-up). Pay attention during the scene in the phone booth, how he elegantly uses the camera to evoke a sense of panic and claustrophobia. That's just one of the great surpluses De Palma always provides in any of his film.MI certainly isn't a typical film for the director, he's never really done this kind of slick action-movie before. I, and most of you, will primarily know him for gangster movies such as Scarface, Carlito's Way and The Untouchables but he's also responsible for Carrie, his best movie so far IMO. For those who do not know it, Carrie is a horror-drama, and a very good one too, so De Palma can pretty much handle every genre and he proves it yet again. The plot moves along very fast, fast enough so the most obvious plot holes aren't noticed. Clever as it may be, it's far from flawless and some of the action sequences aren't exactly state of the art anymore, action-movies will always age faster than any other genre I'm afraid. I'm thinking in particular of the legendary tunnel scene in the end, it all looked a bit too artificial compared to similar sequences in today's films. The above really isn't a flaw, films date, it's unavoidable. In the end, even after 12 years, Mission Impossible has not lost any of it's charm and with, I still get excited seeing it again and again, and fans of the genre who haven't yet should check out this film from an era where Tom Cruise wasn't Scientology crazy and at the top of his 'cool'. Because if MI were to be summarized in one word, I'd definitely be 'COOL' !!8.3/10",8,2,4,15 March 2008
From Hell," Visually stunning genre-transcending film.
","While this comment does include spoilers technically, there's nothing in here that reveals more than a short movie premise...I watched this film many years ago but recently saw it again and felt a strong tendency to write this comment. In 1999 I was only eleven years old and I feel I can really appreciate it more now that I'm older. Don't get me wrong, I liked it when I was a kid, but mainly because I was into horror movies and this movie really scared me.Now, some time later, I do not feel the same way anymore, but instead can appreciate the other things about this film like the colors used, the acting and the various stylish elements applied(the great costumes, etc.)As most of you will know, 'From Hell' tells the semi-fictionalized story of Jack The Ripper, the worlds most notorious serial killer and also one of the first ones and most brutal ones to date. He's known not so much for the quantity of murders, he 'only' made five victims in that dark fall of 1888, but for the brutal way he slaughtered them and the whole mystery that surrounds the murders. The popular rumor that went around London faster than a running fire back then and still lives on today, is that a secret organization called 'the freemasons' was behind the killings, an organization comparable to 'The Skulls' the, let's say, American equivalent. There's no real hard proof for this presumption, but there are some strong leads in the direction. Of course, people like to believe that the magistrates and aristocracy is evil so they are likely to accept this hypothesis without much proof.Now about the movie itself, it has the benefit of a very strong lead cast, with the exception of the unfortunate choice for Heather Graham. She doesn't quite live up to the other actors, but she's not horrible either. I especially dug Robbie Coltrane, but Johnny Depp was fantastic too of course. He proves ones again that he is probably the most versatile actor of his generation, that he's not just 'Jack Sparow' like so many believe. That's a sad thing really, because he's been in some jewels like 'Donnie Brasco' and 'Blow'. What immediately got my attention was the very dark look given to the film, lensed with very intense dark bloody reds, poisonous greens and yellows and a variety of mahogany-ish brown colors. The city of Prague never looked so evil and ominous. Of course Prague is a beautiful setting that lends itself easily to great film-making. Still, I found Prague to be one of the most gorgeous cities of the world, very charming and sweet. To make it look like an evil harbor for the wicked and twisted is really the director's great achievement. It really looked like hell sometimes. There are some other elements that can't be left unmentioned: the repetitive use of the metal stairs of the carriage(the click sounds horrifying for some reason) and the great way in which the first murder is filmed. This proves once again the strength of the power of suggestion. You really make the most horrifying images in your brain, which is so much more frightening than if we'd actually seen the gory images. Of course, later on in the film it gets pretty hard for the weak stomached, but I never had a problem with that.Another great thing about this film, is the fact that it really is a multi-genre one, which is a rare quality these days (I mean this in the best way possible). It's not a horror film, not a pure thriller either, and not a drama. It's a little of all three and that is what makes the film so memorable in my opinion.For those of you who may not have seen it when reading this comment, even though I included a spoiler warning, you might be interested to know that this film is based on a graphic novel by Alan Moore, the very same Alan Moore who created the fantastic 'V For Vendetta'. If you loved that, I can almost guarantee that you will like this too...So that's it for my comment, if you're not shocked by the bad quality of this comment than please check 'useful'. I'd appreciate it.A new review in a lil' while, keep track of them if you like, there are 75 now. This film gets 7.7 from me, well deserved.",7,2,3,17 January 2008
The Untouchables," A True Classic
","The Untouchables is one of my favorite De Palma films and one of my favorite films of the '80's over all. Face it, the '80's was a poor period for cinema. There are only a handful of true classics from that time and this is one of them.There's plenty of comedy, action, clever dialog, beautiful music and costumes present to make 3 good films. The best part of this film was probably the score. One of the best ones the master has made and definitely my favorite. He's reinvented movie scores in so many ways. The whole cast delivers a decent performance, with the exception of Sean Connery and Robert De Niro, who really lift this film to a higher level. I can't think of anyone more perfect to portray Capone than De Niro. Connery got the Oscar. Did he deserve it for this? Maybe, maybe not. Fact is he did deserve it for a great series of wonderful performances before 1987. He steals every scene in The Untouchables, like he does in so many of his films. One thing I can't fail to mention is the camera-work in this film. It may not be very modern but it sure is stylish. I loved it and would prefer a style like this always over modern camera-work à la Greengrass.Many complain about the level of cheesiness, but I find many scenes charming and endearing rather than cheesy. I guess it depends on how you feel the movie personally. It's never meant to be as gritty as Carlito's Way or Scarface. People who expect everyone of De Palma's films to have the same atmosphere as his most famous works shall be disappointed. I personally like De Palma's variety in films.'The Untouchables' is a True Classic and should be recognized for it. One of the few greats of the '80's.8.8/10",9,0,2,7 December 2007
Scream," Wes Craven resurrects the Slasher genre with one hell of a movie.
","Horror movie are considered by most bottom-of-the-ladder cinema. And let's face it, they have a point. The True Classics can be counted on one hand. A Nightmare On Elm Street is fantastic, Carrie is brilliant, but only a few other movies in the genre deserve to be mentioned in one breath with them. 'Scream' is definitely one of them, a scary movie with real scares, a more than decent soundtrack, acting that is of a very rare quality in the genre and a very surprising ending for a change. What makes the movie work on the level of believability is the nifty way it was written. By the characters' constant mentioning of real movies, you get the sense that the world they live in is in fact ours. Countless movies use this technique (Donnie Darko with Evil Dead for instance) and it works very well on a subconscious level.Another thing the movie has going for it, is the clichés. Craven actually embraces them and the film is filled with them on purpose. It actually ends with the ambulance and police cars shot, seen in countless action or horror movies.Many people who haven't seen the movie may assume 'Scream' is just the next over-hyped brainless pubescent cinema, but it's far from that. It's without a doubt the best of the rebirth wave of slasher movies of the mid -90's (although I liked 'I know What You Did' too), and can in no way be compared to the truckload of bad horror movies coming out every day still. The plot is original in all it's cliché-glory and the characters are relatively complex, the mask may be a little laughable but 'Scream' was never meant to be taken seriously. It's a homage to slasher movies, and the homage turned out to be better than almost all films of it's kind.",8,0,1,12 February 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Amazing Action movie that Lacks the Trademark Die Hard Charm...
","Die Hard 4.0 (USA title: Live Free Or Die Hard) is the eagerly awaited fourth in the phenomenal Die Hard series. For the people who are not familiar with the other Die Hard films...stop reading this comment now ( yes I mean NOW !!) and go rent the other ones. ROFL.The Die Hard films are a brilliant mix of original action-scenes and witty humor. They are widely appreciated by action film and non-action film lovers both( I'm the latter). Now...could the fourth in the series top the other films or at least equal it...?? I'm afraid the answer is...NO, although it was a lot better then I expected. It's definitely one of the best films of the year. Let there be no mistake about this: I am a huge Die Hard 4.0 fan. There are tons of fantastic action scenes. They're completely over-the-top at all times but If you know the other three films you know that's what Die Hard is all about. We get to see astonishing scenes with helicopters, planes and trucks. Yes, they really spared no costs or efforts to make the action scenes work. All of this can't make up for the fact that Die Hard 4.0 lacks the charm and wittiness of the other ones. Most of the humor used was a bit cheesy...whatever happened to 'This is what a TV-dinner must feel like...'? or the hilarious Mclane ramblings? Add this flaw to the flawed script and you'll see why Die Hard 4.0 at no time lives up to the other ones.There's also been a lot of criticism on the casting, I however liked the cast very much: The relatively unknown Justin Long get's a huge part. I only know him from Jeepers Creepers and didn't like him that much in that film...but I have to admit he did a good job in DH 4.0. Also the casting of Olyphant brought up a lot of contradictory reactions but I think he was great. He's no Jeremy Irons but he pulls it off.My conclusion: Die Hard 4.0 is cursed by the Die Hard name: the other films are hard or impossible to top...but Die Hard 4.0 still makes a fantastic summer action film and will be one of the best films of '07.",7,0,1,15 July 2007
The Sixth Sense," I see dead people...walking around like regular people.
","The Sixth Sense is M. Night Shyamalan first big budget and best film. It's a film that heavily relies on the creating and maintaining of a certain atmosphere. It has a psychological tension that's only broken in a few scenes( Magic trick scene ao.). A little comical relief( although there are only 2 such scenes) is very welcome to not make the story too heavy (so everyone can enjoy it). Films tend to get boring if the story is too linear.The Sixth Sense has a surprise ending ( many films will use this in the following years) but it's not all about the ending ( in contrary to certain other films that I will not name to avoid spoiling). The story on itself is very interesting but the ending is the cherry on the pie. Many who saw it the first time were in disbelief: is this right...? After re-watching it several times...yes it is. The plot is almost watertight. I suppose if you want to you can always find tiny little mistakes but I haven't found any big ones. The Sixth Sense is unbelievably well cast: Bruce Willis delivers his 2nd best performance( 12 Monkeys is his best), debutant Haley Joel Osment is excellent( his performance in A.I is also excellent, other movies of his were mostly disappointing performances), Toni Colette delivers the first in a long series of Oscar-worthy performances (also see The Night Listener, The Hours, Little Miss Sunshine ao. ) and the performance of Donnie Wahlberg musn't be forgotten even though he only gets 3 minutes of screen time. Olivia Williams may be the only lesser performance in the lead cast but she still does an OK job. We can see several Shyamalan's trademarks for the first time: He uses very natural colors( brown, white, gray, beige, green) in the interiors and clothing. Another trademark for his work is the fragmentary use of a rich red color to break with the dull colors in the background. He doesn't overuse the red so it preserves its power. We can also see Shyamalan's excellent use of colors in The Village ( even more then in the sixth sense): red stands for evil,misfortune and fear while yellow stands for weakness. The Village is M. Night's third best film in my opinion (Unbreakable is the one that closest approaches TSS brilliance). It's also unbelievably well-acted, the story is strong, the settings are beautiful...definitely worth watching ( if hope you have seen it but if you haven't...you know what to do). It's a bit under-appreciated on IMDb but don't let that fool you.I'm no direction expert but I found it to be brilliant. The brilliance lies in the details; the excellent use of mirrors and shadows, the lighting, eccentric camera viewpoints,...it's a delight for a filmenthousiast( like yours truly) to watch. You can feel Shyamalan is both writer and director; he knows exactly what to do with the material and which camera shot would be best for which scene.What makes The Sixth Sense into a brilliant film( what distinguishes it from other great films)? It's hard to explain but it's a magical film to watch. Certainly one of my personal favorite films. 10/10 for this flawless piece of brilliance !!",10,7,9,21 June 2007
Gladiator," Quite simply the best epic movie ever made !
","After my recent re-viewing of the film, I felt obliged to leave a comment. Gladiator is the epic that makes all other epics look bad, it's flawless in almost every way. The music is more than top notch: Hans Zimmer has written his best score in years, the locations are astonishingly beautiful, the colors used are very well chosen and add to the certain atmosphere the movie has, the acting is brilliant: there are three Oscar-worthy performances here (Djimon Hounsou, Joaquin Phoenix, Russell Crowe)...all the elements come together just right and that's really so unique that it's a thrill to watch.There are two things that completely make or break a movie for me: the beginning and the end. A movie can be brilliant up until the end but if that last scene disappoints, I leave the movie theater with a bad aftertaste. Luckily, in Gladiator, the ending is brilliantly haunting, which adds so much to the movie. The music accompanying the scene is one of the best fitting scene-music pieces ever. It's just indescribable.While some may argue that it doesn't deserve all the praise it's getting because it's 'just an action-movie', I feel that it's so much more than that: the dialog is great, the acting likewise, and while the movie may have a large number of action-sequences, that's not what it's really about. It's a tale of a person, a very real person, which is a truly remarkable one.After recently seeing Troy, 300 and Alexander, I'm convinced now more than ever, that Gladiator will be the best epic ever made for years to come ( even despite the growth in technical ability over the last few years). It's always been on my best-of list and that's not likely going to change soon. If I could give more than 10, I would, but since I can't...:-)10/10",10,1,2,14 October 2007
High Fidelity," cute, clever romantic comedy that's unique in it's genre...
","This is a great movie with a radiant John Cusack and a very funny Jack Black as the stars. It's a relief to see a comedy once in a while that knows what subtlety is.High Fidelity 's got it's very own style and it follows the book quite well. What's so great about this movie, besides the great humor, is that we finally get to see a romantic comedy from the male point of view. Everything is so recognizable. It's not full of clichés.It's a cute, clever romantic comedy but a fun ride all the way to the end. A definite must-see.",8,0,1,2 December 2007
Atonement," Has it's strong points and it's weaknesses.
","Well, I rarely call a movie pretentious but I make an exception now. An annoying repetitive piano score, a constant mix of long and short shots (well, not constant but when it happened it was very irritating) and a script that's completely incoherent. The writers seem to have forgotten about a little thing called ACT 2. You basically have a very long opening act where you don't really get to know the characters, and then it just keeps ending, one drama after another that is supposed to affect us...but how can it? There is absolutely no connection between the characters and the audience. About the acting...James McAvoy was quite good (he confirms his excellent performance in The Last King Of Scotland) and Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave were decent too (although they got way too little screen time IMO). Keira Knightley however was terrible. I've never considered her to be a bad actress but her performance in this should've been better. She got such a big role and so much screen time and she doesn't manage to even affect the audience. A totally forgettable film I'm afraid.To end on a positive note, I'd like to mention the great locations, one very impressive one-take long shot in Dunkerke (several minutes long), McAvoy's great performance and one scene that is very powerful and almost heartbreaking.6.2/10",6,2,5,30 December 2007
