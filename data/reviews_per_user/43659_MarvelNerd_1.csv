The Avengers," The best comic Book movie of all time! WARNING SPOILERS!
","I really liked previous marvel cinematic universe movies and my favorite is Captain America because I think it was a different movie and I really liked the tone of it ! Iron man and Thor were really good movies and iron man 2 and the incredible hulk were just OK to me! So now we have The Avengers ! Marvel chose Joss Whedon to direct the movie , and one of the things I like about joss is that he is an incredible talent writer and he is a comic book nerd and writes comics! The Avengers is by far the best comic book movie of all time! I really liked the dark knight and spider man 2 but this one is better! ACTORS : what a cast!Robert downey jr reprises his role as the genius, billionaire, playboy and philanthropist , Tom Hiddleston as loki , Chris Evans as the living legend Captain America , Chris Hemmsworth as thor , the lovely Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow , Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Mark Ruffalo as the Incredible Hulk! ACTION: lots of action scenes in this movie and lots of humor!*************SPOILERS***************FAVORITE SCENES: THE final battle ! HULK smashing loki , and thor vs iron man!WHAT I Didn't LIKE: Agent coulson death! I really liked that guy!WATCH THIS MOVIE AND STAY FOR CREDITS SCENE YOU WONT BE Disappointed",10,8,17,29 April 2012
