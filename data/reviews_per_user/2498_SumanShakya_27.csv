Captain Phillips," Thrilling and Gripping
","Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy fame) has directed two films on important historic events, 'Bloody Sunday' and 'United 93.' 'Captain Phillips' is also based on a real story (a kind of story which you would likely read in Reader's Digest under drama in real life section) where an American cargo ship is hijacked by Somali pirates and the captain is held hostage.The film on a whole captures the action sequences familiar from regular Hollywood movies and is overlong, which somewhat loses the impact of the film. Besides, the film somewhat lacks the novelty of 'United 93' in filming the events or narrating the story and isn't very different from the regular movies. Despite the over length and the familiar premises of action, the film is thrilling, gripping, and exhausting. Tom Hanks as usual makes a remarkable performance through his wit trying to deal with the pirates and save his crew. In the climax, he just excels and makes you numb. I'm a little shaky about the film's or director's chances of getting an Oscar as story wise, the film is doesn't go beyond normal; but Tom Hanks surely is a deserving nominee for best actor this year. Had the film been trimmed a bit, the film would have been a very tight thriller of the year. On a whole, I liked the film and I'm sure you would find it entertaining.Rating: 2.5 stars out of 4",7,0,0,1 February 2014
Airlift," Common man turning into a hero.... an inspirational film.....
","In 1990, when Irag attacked Kuwait, over 1 Lakh Seventy thousand Indians were stranded in Kuwait. The film is based on the evacuation of the Indians during Gulf War in Iraq. The stranded were airlifted by Air India, which is considered one of the biggest evacuation operations in the history. The film majorly deals with the efforts of a Kuwait based Indian businessman who leads the evacuation of the Indians by setting shelter and helping them to cross the borders of Kuwait to take them to Jordan from where they were all airlifted by Air India.Indeed the story is marvelous which just grip you tight to your seats. Besides, the film remains tremendously well made with a taut direction and sequences that touch you. At least there were 4-5 sequences in the film in which you just feel like applauding. The success of this film owes to the humanity it brings in its story. The film just depicts how a common man can turn into a hero when he saves humanity which gets well reflected in Akshay's character. You don't need to fight or show your valor in a battlefield. Once you think beyond your family to save someone else' life, it's not less heroic. In terms of theme the film is similar to 'Schindler's List.' 'Airlift' might not find itself in the list of historical landmark of film making like 'Schindler's List' but the story and Akshay Kumar's and Namrata Kaur's performance does touch you for a while. Though the film might lack the rawness and calibre of 'Schindler's List,' making the film on such a historical event which has never been seen in the screen is indeed commendable.Rating: 3 stars out of 4",7,0,0,28 March 2016
Gravity," Techinically brilliant..... but lacks the emotional depth......
","With the recent Oscar nomination march on, I watched 'Gravity' with a high expectation. And after watching it thought, it would have been better had I watched it in 3D. What happens when you are adrift in the outer space without gravity is what the film's plot is about. And with the space suits on, Sandra Bullock as a medical engineer and George Clooney as a veteran astronaut take us to the journey outside the space which highlights the technical brilliance in movie making. You get stunned, and Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as usual enlivens the film through their screen presence. But beyond that the film appears a bit empty lacking the emotional depth or depth in characters. In the aspect, I liked 'Apollo 13' which documented an important event form the space history. In 'Gravity' the story somehow resembles the adrift journey of 'Wall-E.' You would surely be mesmerized by its sheer expertise in the visuals but in terms of story and characters, the film ends inadequate; and to me 'The Life of Pi' was better. Overall, the film ends pretty well technically but I highly doubt about its probability for getting through Oscars in the popular awards.Rating: 2 stars out of 4",6,0,1,27 January 2014
The Impossible," The Impossible .... a nice film on Thai Tsunami......
","'The Impossible' manifests the disasters led by the 2004 Tsunami that hit Thailand in December. The film chronicles the story of a couple with their three sons who come to a Thai beach during the Christmas vacation and face one of the greatest catastrophes and get separated from the Tsunami. Perhaps one of the major films on Tsunami after 8 years of its occurrence, it tries to revoke a theme on disaster and succeeds to a par excellence in terms of narration, acting, and photography. At times the film has a feel of a docudrama and at times even becomes digressive but on a whole, the film is rich in emotions and melodrama and succeeds in bringing the harrowing experiences led by a natural catastrophe. On a whole, though not the best family film I've watched; I would still like to strongly recommend this film as it tries to revive one of the unforgettable events from the history seen through cinematic frame. Rating: 2 stars out of 4",7,0,1,14 November 2013
Argo," Brilliant......
","Ben Affleck brings a stunning political thriller based on a true story this time dealing with the US hostage crisis of Iran in 1979. The film deals with an important issue on political history and shows the national diplomatic steps taken to release 6 US hostages from Iran. The story the film carries is much harrowing and just hits hard and makes you think twice. The screenplay, direction, acting all makes the film compulsively watchable and deserves much of applause due to the important issue of international interest the film raises which many filmmakers don't dare to. The film has a grisly feel like that of a thriller with a rusty look of 70s which grips you throughout and shows you some of the grisly truths from the history which haven't much appeared on the screen except in the newspaper articles.With 'Argo' Ben Affleck comes as a next iconic filmmaker. I have watched all his major directorial ventures and with each of the films he has directed, 'Gone Baby Gone' and 'The Town', he has improved a lot and sets a notable achievement through 'Argo.' Rating: 4 stars out of 4",10,1,5,14 November 2013
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag," Nice and Inspirational biopic though slow and overlong......
","In a brunch of regular commercial movies, it's a relief to watch biopics like 'Bhaag Milkha Bhag.' Such movies tend to educate viewers about the forgotten heroes. Such is Milkha Singh, who gave fame to his country as an athlete. The film chronicles the hardship of Milkha Singh to rise to fame from the dark childhood to hardships in the training. Though remarkable in its content and the numerous awards the film bagged last year, the film somehow lacks a coherent pacing and becomes overlong. The performance of Farhan Akhtar as Milkha Singh is remarkable. Sonam Kapoor's role gets wasted. Music is pretty nice though the songs feel a bit numerous in the film. Overall, the film is nice and inspirational as a sincere biopic on an athlete with a remarkable central character; but it somewhat lacks a coherent pacing to grip you. On the matter, 'Mary Kom' is more preferable.Rating: 2 stars out of 4",6,1,2,18 December 2014
Life of Pi," Visually Splendid.....
","With a mouth of word publicity and the fact that the movie got 11 nominations in Oscars 'Life is Pi' had gained an enormous attention during its release. The film is based on a Booker prize winning novel of a teenage Indian boy who gets adrift in a ship wreckage with a zebra, hyena, Orangutan, and a Bengal tiger competing for a fierce battle of survival. The film starts as a family drama on Indian culture, but within few reels the film delves into its main theme on survival. And on this aspect, the film somehow resembles 'Cast Away.' The difference is 'Cast Away' projects the power of a star to hold your attention in the survival game whereas in 'Life of Pi' the specialty is the camera work and the special effects that hold your attention. The shots with the animals like the sequence of the hyena, orangutan and zebra or the shots with the Richard Parker (the tiger) are just mesmerizing. Despite the colorful cinematography and beautiful canvass of the film, the film lacks a meatier story. Anyway, visually the film is splendid and stores some of the best shots of the year.Rating: 2 stars out of 4",8,0,2,30 December 2013
The Revenant," Visceral and Visually Stunning.....
","A highly anticipated contender for Oscars, 'The Revenant' landed with winning the coveted awards for Best Director and Best Actor, giving Leonardo Di Caprio his much awaited Oscars and losing Best Picture to 'The Spotlight.' The film deserves a heavy applause for two very strong reasons. The first for the superb cinematography it uses which gives the depiction of the 18th century America and an expedition of the hunters in the snow capped mountains of North America. The landscapes and the camera angle chill your spines and frightens for the force of nature and isolation it can bring. For most of the part, the film uses the natural landscape than computer generated images which has dominated film making for quite a time which makes it a visual treat. The second reason to admire the film is the superb performance of Leonardo Di Caprio, who appears away from his Titanic fame boyish performances which he has been giving most of the time. Without much of the dialogues, he somewhat gets into the skin of the character sparkling the screen in his presence.Undoubtedly, the film is flawless technically and sets a benchmark in the cinematographic achievement in movies. But regarding the story and script, the film lacks a tightness and fails to grip at times. The tightness of Alejandro's earlier movies 'Amorres Perros' and 'Babel' is somewhat missing in this one. The film becomes a survival game in the wilderness of American landscape, somewhat familiar from Tom Hank's 'Cast Away.' Then the film draws to a revenge story where the protagonist avenges for the desolation from his friend who attempts to kill him and his son, which seems pretty obvious. There isn't much substance in the story and it somewhat drags and is interested in holding the viewers for the star power of Di Caprio with scars and anticipation to be free from the desolation rather than the story. Had the story been tighter and the length been trimmed a bit, the film could have been much memorable.Rating: 2.5 stars out of 4",7,1,3,8 March 2016
Bridge of Spies," A brilliant historical movie by Spielberg.....
","Steven Spielberg is among the few legendary film makers who have made their prominence for the versatility in the subjects they bring through their films. On one hand, Spielberg had made a touching children drama 'E.T THe Extra Terristrial' and on the other side gave 'Schindler's List' documenting history, making it appear larger than life. His versatility continues even today with a touching movie like 'War Horse' based on the children's novel or a historical movie like 'Bridge of Spies.' May that be 'Empire of the Sun,' 'Saving Private Ryan,' or 'Jurassic Park,' he always had the clarity in story telling and with 'Bridge of Spies' it seems he is still unbeatable in terms of story telling.'Bridge of Spies,' as has been narrated, is said to be inspired by true events depicting the cold war of 60s between the United States and the Soviet, during which an American attorney opts to negotiate an exchange between a Soviet Spy and an American pilot and a student. In a way, the film retells a segment of history which we haven't read yet. Whatever the film shows come very strongly and just touches you. An attorney who receives hate from the Americans becomes a negotiator for the US president explains a lot of our central character. in the role, Tom Hanks as usual gives a tremendous performance, which sadly went not nominated this time at the Oscars. But a face that catches your attention the most is Mark Rylance as a Soviet Spy, who won an Oscar for his performance. Even with the minimal dialogues he was given, he makes a prominent presence in the film, for which he deserved the award.Overall, just watch this film to know a part of history, or feel the extraordinary power of Spielberg's story telling, or simply if you're an admirer of Tom Hank's brilliant performance.Rating: 3 stars out of 4",8,1,2,31 March 2016
The Shining," Overlong and uninteresting horror flick......
","'The Shining' was an overly hyped horror flick that has gained a cult status of a classic. But after watching it, I was disappointed. Based on Stephen King's novel, the film drags and goes on for an inordinate length. Had watched 'Apt Pupil' based on the novel written by the same author. Comparing the movies, it becomes obvious that the stories have promising beginnings but fall to very unrefined clichés in the end.The film does have few moments but by then you just start to lose your interest. The film deals with double personality and hallucinations, but on the term, the film is nowhere close to the spooky thriller 'The Sixth Sense.' Where the presentation of 'Sixth Sense' was tremendous, 'The Shining' remains utterly boring. Only the saving grace was the nice camera work and the grandiose of the setting; else other remains forgettable.Rating: 1 star out of 4",3,6,17,25 August 2014
Dangal," Dangal: an inspirational movie
","With word of mouth, you may have all known what a big hit 'Dangal' became lately and the critical accolades the film received. Instead of taking the promotions for granted, I insist you to watch this film first.The film is based on a true story of an Indian wrestler, Mahavir Singh Phogat, who trains his two daughters, Gita and Babita, to win the international level wrestling competitions. It's commendable that few film makers have started to make movies on the real heroes of the country, whose tales of heroism are often unheard of. It takes a story from a small village of Haryana and takes it to an international milieu. Many are relating this movie with year's another hit, 'Sultan.' But these two films are in no way to be compared of. Though both the films are on wrestling, 'Dangal' explores many entities like the social discrimination on girls, state of sports federation, father daughter relationships.Where the film explores the wrestling arena from a small Haryana village to a national level training centre, the film is also filled with emotions, wit, and other finer nuances of life. Aamir Khan as usual is good, but the two girls as Geeta and Babita both were outstanding. Watched this film in theatre, and the audiences were seen applauding when the girls enter the arena and play for their country. The Haryani environment and the dialects used in the film gives it a mesmerizing touch. Just like 'Chakde India' and 'Mary Kom,' 'Dangal' will remain one of the finest sports movies to come lately.Rating: 3 stars out of 4",8,2,4,21 January 2017
The Fault in Our Stars," Agony of Star-crossed Lovers......
","The film has gained a lot of popularity among the young audiences. The reason is obvious, the agony of young star crossed lovers depicted through few emotional sequences. To be fair, the film doesn't create the flair of a nice melodrama. Perhaps due to lack of a better script, the characters somewhat don't appear sympathetic which they ought to be. However in certain instances, the film does work; and particularly, the performance of heroine overshadows the hero's role, which unfortunately doesn't look very natural. Nowhere the signs of disability or the affliction appears in the hero's character. The biggest flaw in the script of the film was its failure to depict the dreadfulness of the cancer they are ongoing which makes the film appear not more than a feel good time passer. The affliction of the disease and their scorn or desire with life doesn't just come in this teenage romance. Only the sequence shot in Anne Frank's museum catches the agony of the protagonist.Rating: 1.5 stars out of 4",5,1,2,14 October 2014
Room," a Touching Drama on Desolation and Motherhood......
","Based on a best selling novel, 'Room' chronicles the story of a lady and her son held captive by a kidnapper, who actually is his biological father, in a shed comprising merely a 10 X 10 room. For the boy, the room is the only world he has known. The only medium he can see outside is the skylight in the room. The story may sound a nerdy fiction; but the film focuses much on the psychological aspects and discovers the story of desolation and motherhood which comes vividly alive on the screen. There are few scenes in which the boy and the mother have screamed to each other which could have been avoided alas they were like the scenes demanding the Oscars. Nevertheless, the film won an Oscar for the best performance by an actress. The film avoids big star cast or sets; but still the film is rich in emotions, performances, and beauty. The film just beautifully portrays the perspective of a five year old boy who doesn't know the world for real except for what his mother has told him or what he has seen in the TV screen. The emotional attachment portrayed between the two is awesome. Brie Larson's performance doesn't yet equal the winning Oscar performances from Julia Roberts or Hilary Swank, but still she appears stunning and well portrays a petrified lady held captive for six years. Few sequences are pretty familiar, but there are certain moments in the film for which you are drawn to it.Rating: 3 stars out of 4",8,6,12,4 April 2016
Schindler's List," An Excellent Film on Holocaust.......
","Actually I had watched this film 13-14 years ago. But that time I got pretty distracted and couldn't grasp much of the film. After watching it again, I must say it's a remarkable film which comes once in a while. Based on the true events of the holocaust, the film is like a well written book which can serve as a quality time to anyone striving for a brilliant work of art.Well, many nice films have been made on Jews concentration camps like 'Life Is Beautiful,' 'The Pianist,' or the most recent 'The Boys on Striped Pyjamas.' Indeed all the movies were brilliant, but they saw holocaust through individual character. But 'Schindler's List' gives a holistic account of the history for which the film stretches for over 3 hours and uses monochromatic colors to give the periodic feel. Despite the over-length, every scene of the film remains compulsively watchable till the end credits. Every scene presents a cinematic excellence in depicting the story of a greedy industrialist who saves over 1100 Jews from the concentration camps. His uplift of the spirit from greed to human compassion, seeing the atrocities of Nazis, is brilliantly realized. The bloodshed in the film starts with a single execution which slowly shifts to mass killings during the liquidation of ghettos showing the brutality done to humankind, which just leaves you horrified. The grit and the depressing environment the film creates is pretty touching and many moments of the film raises the feelings of humanity for which the film becomes a well felt heart touching saga. For focusing the story. the film keeps a low profile with much unknown cast and avoids sentimentality and gloss till the very end. Overall, the film remains a landmark for the ages to come; and it deserves to be archived as one of the immortal film makings of all time.Rating: 4 stars out of 4",10,29,49,31 January 2016
Sultan," Technically good... but lacking in melodrama....
","'Sultan' was one of the most awaited releases of 2016, owing to its stardom values and the success of 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan.' Technically the film is, no doubt, sound. The cinematography, music, special effects all are well done; but the film lacks much of substance, twists and turns in the story. Besides, the film is overlong and appears more an escapist melodrama which goes to easiness instead of an emotional depth.Salman Khan, with added weight, and Anushka Sharma, speaking Haryanvi, are the major attractions of the movie, who add the credibility to the film. Salman's get up is pretty well and he performs nevertheless good and Anushka Sharma, though in her regular image, still add some glamour in this overlong, deserted melodrama. Though the film gets dragging due to lack of shades in the story, the film does lack the regular Bollywood gimmicks or the unnecessary violence, for which the film still remains watchable. For me, the film was fine, technically it's good but story wise, it's dragging and overlong failing to weave a touching melodrama.Rating: 2 stars out of 4",5,3,4,24 October 2016
Grave of the Fireflies," A poignant tale depicting the harrowing events of war-torn Japan during World War II
","Perhaps for the first time, I watched such a heart wrenching, realistic and poignant tale in an animated movie. The movie charts the tale of a 14 year old brother and his 4 year old sister who are left alone to fend for themselves in war torn Japan. Their mother fell victim to the air bombings which leaves them to shift to their aunt. Slowly the two face the wrath of the war and succumb to malnutrition. Perhaps there is not such distress as of dying of hunger. And the film brings this to the screen, which makes this film just distressing and grim, which you won't dare to go through again.A film that starts on a light note with an undying love and affection of a brother towards his sister ends up with the struggle for survival during wartime where the only motive becomes fulfilling the hunger. The story unfolds vividly in the picture just making you cry. Perhaps this demonstrates the power of the movie to sweep you along. Before this, I felt 'The Pianist' was able to do the same. Besides, the fabulous animation which you can expect from Japanese animes, there is a tremendously moving story to the film which would make it memorable. Well, most of the Disney and Pixar animations have made you laugh all the way, this movie has a power to make you cry.Rating:: 3 stars out of 4",8,1,2,29 June 2014
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Horror of Holocaust seen in a Different Perspective.......
","There have been notable movies on holocaust featuring the harrowing experiences of the Jews Concentration Camp like 'Schindler's List' (in which a businessman saves a huge number of Jews from gassing in the concentration camps), 'Life Is Beautiful' (in which a Jews father saves his son in the concentration camp by pretending they are in a picnic), 'The Pianist' (a real story of a pianist who hides out to remain alive in the Warsaw Ghetto). Well, 'The Boy in the Stripped Pajamas' doesn't have the enough power to hold you for its slow pace and a blatant narrative. But the approach with which it views the holocaust is pretty different and touching. It views the terrors of holocaust through a friendship between eight year old Bruno with a Jew Boy and the unexpected consequences of the friendship. The film at the beginning feels a bit a cold attempt in reviving the atrocities of holocaust but by the end it turns into a touching story of humanity and innocence which fell victim to war.Rating: 2 stars out of 4",7,1,1,21 February 2015
Brave," Funny....
","This time Walt Disney takes a comic approach mixed with some fairy tale and dramatic elements, and the result is quite an engaging and entertaining tale that keeps you glued as long as it lasts. The animation is much crisper and with the promos, the film looked very promising and elegant. Well, the film does carry some charm and might be liked by children; but the story is quite weak this time which meanders into some forgettable Disney movies of the past like 'Brother Bear.' The dialogues lack the punches of 'Tangled' and 'Up.' But nevertheless, the film makes a joyous watch. Only it fails to become memorable and a classic; a kind of movie you won't bother much about in the future. Rating: 2 stars out of 4",7,0,2,4 December 2013
Everest," A Visually Stunning Disaster Movie but Not the Best One ....
","The film shows a statistics that only one in four have been able to return safely after Everest's ascent. The risk involved in mountain climbing is immense, with the possibility of avalanches, altitude sickness, hypothermia, frost bite, which has been briefed in the beginning. The story en-capsules the 1996 expedition to Everest by a team of 13 mountaineers who face a devastating snow storm after ascending the Everest, which is considered one of the deadliest disasters in Everest.The film is superb in terms of visuals. The mountains, camps, glaciers nowhere look graphical. As I've been in the mountain flight (a popular flight in Nepal where twin engined aircraft fly as close to 5 miles to the Himalayas at a high altitude to show the breath taking views of the mountains), I've experienced how the Himalayas look at a close range. The views of Everest from the base camp, Lukla Airport, and a rescue helicopter trying to land amid the high wind are superb testifying the hardship of mountain climbing. The abrupt linkages of the facts and information documents the geographical setting well. But I limit my praise for the film only up-to this as in terms of story or character development, the film falls pretty weak.Despite showcasing an important phase of history and technically made well, the film fails to become a memorable one. It's not another Cliffhanger or Vertical Limit (caper movies on mountain climbing with villains.) As a good point, the film doesn't dramatize much of the sequences. But it's also not 'Touching the void', which is one of the most tense and visceral movies I've ever watched on mountain climbing. 'Everest' doesn't raise more than a documentary failing to get deep into the skin or examine the human spirit of the characters which could have made the film memorable. The film gives a certain footage on history or recreate the adventure and tragedy, but the feeling tried to be created is inadequate which doesn't fulfill the hype created.Rating: 1.5 stars out of 4",5,10,11,24 December 2015
The Graduate," The Graduate (1967).....wonderful 60s
","'The Graduate' starts as a sex comedy with a recently graduated college student having an affair with one of his parent's friend and later falling in love with her daughter. The rest of the film is a light romantic comedy on how he actually gets her. This sweet 60s classic has all that makes it a classic: no overdose of drama or stunts. Just naturally the story builds with fabulous songs and a light dose of comedy which nowhere becomes crude. Though feels a bit slow in the beginning, there is much of wittiness and charm in each of the situations created in the story. It was one of Dustin Hoffman's earlier movies. Looking a bit expressionless, he carries the film. Perhaps one of the biggest actors of all time, I had myself been a big admirer of his acting in Oscar winning performances of Kramer Vs Kramer and Rain Man. Just a small agony that such wonderful days of 60s movies won't come again.Rating: 3 stars out of 4",8,0,0,14 November 2013
Les Misérables," A romantic musical set against French Rebellion.....
","'Les Miserables' is fully narrated as a musical with almost all the dialogues sung and reminds of the 60s musicals like 'Oliver' or 'My fair Lady.' From the maker of The Kings Speech, Les Miserables also charts a historical story set in the background of relationships, love, care, and humanity, which comes as a great feast for your eyes through superb cinematography and performances, with a small but a winning performance from Anne Hathaway as a prostitute, Hugh Jackman as a runaway parole, and Russel Crowe as a ruthless policeman. Set as a musical stage play, the film succeeds in its depiction of historical details and character development. However, the over doing of song sequences and over length of the movie certainly creates a distraction and takes away certain leverage from the film. But overall, the film is still impressive at instances and singing is also good. Anyway, I feel liking of this musical would be to the taste of the individual viewers. For me, the film was still a visual treat ; and at instances felt good with the narration and performances.Rating : 2 stars out of 4",6,0,0,14 November 2013
Zero Dark Thirty," Zero Dark Thirty (2012)...... Hunt for Osama bin Laden.....
","'Zero Dark Thirty' chronicles the events that lead to the hunt of Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, the film runs like a full feature documentary that overlooks dramatization and becomes digressive most of the times, but by the end, the film is rewarding in terms that it remains truthful and is based on the first hand information (as the film claims). Perhaps it wasn't easy to chronicle the decade long hunt of Al Qaeda leader; so the film and the tactics in the beginning was a bit confusing and clumsy. The beginning shows few inhumanely tortures done on the detainees following terrorists attacks of 9/11. (We have the whole documentary 'Taxi to the Dark Side' on this) But the final half an hour raid filmed is perhaps one of the best shots I've ever seen in movies and brings the essence of the film as zero dark thirty which stands for the military mission carried half past the midnight. In terms of historical importance, the film garners a lot of momentum and would be remembered much for the role of Jessica Chastain, as a CBI officer, who firmly pursues her hunt for Bin Laden after her reluctance in the beginning. The role doesn't parallel Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich or Jodie Foster from The Silence of the Lambs, but she carries the film in the end with a feeling of gratitude for her contribution to nation and its peace. Perhaps the film might be overwritten for its documentary feel, but personally, I feel it was the second best film nominated for Oscars this year after 'Argo.'Rating: 3 stars out of 4",7,2,5,14 November 2013
Finding Dory," Adventure under the water continues.....
","Those who loved 'Finding Nemo' will anticipate some adventures under the water, which 'Finding Dory' caters. Just like the previous film, which has gained a cult status, the animation and sequences are pretty marvelous. I guess it would be much more a lavish experience if you watch it on a big screen. It takes you to the world inside the water under the seas, pipes, aquariums, and buckets. Through the superb animation and a fast pace, it holds you and entertains you for its entire length. Though there is a lot of happenings in the film, it is not an improvement over 'Finding Nemo,' in terms of story or characters. Dory lacks the charm spelled by Nemo; and it kinda drops to unbelievable clichés in the end. In comparison, 'Finding Nemo' is still preferable.Rating: 2 stars out of 4",6,8,17,19 January 2017
Flight," An awesome film with a terrific performance....
","An airliner pilot crash lands a passenger plane that goes nose dive and protects almost all on board which everyone calls a miraculous survival. The plane obviously goes down due to technical failure, but the investigation reveals the captain had consumed alcohol and his alcoholism and stupendous flying capability get questioned. After a long time, I have been able to watch a genuine drama that tells a modern story; and 'Flight' makes a lot of justice in that aspect. Though it involves the survival game and many improbabilities, psychological aspects of characters are revealed instead of stunts which makes the story awesome. Besides, the film is filled with nice performances notably from Denzel Washington for which I expect a deserving Oscar after 'Training Day.' Except few unpleasantness the film carries of modern aridities, the film is really engaging and would definitely make you think. So I give this film two very enthusiastic thumbs up.Rating: 2.5 stars out of 4",8,1,2,30 December 2013
Happy New Year," Not awful........ neither impressive........
","If you're an avid viewer of Bollywood movies, you'd naturally anticipate revenge and romance in the regular commercial movies. The story of 'Happy New Year' also does revolve around the revenge of the hero and a brief romance; but the thing more in this movie is a scheme on heist. The scheme isn't very different from the popular Hollywood action flick 'The Italian Job' in which a group of five with different capabilities plan a heist. The scheme of 'Happy New Year' consists of many improbabilities and many unlovable characters. The stunts are unbelievable, characters are a bit card board, and the film stretches on and on. Had the film focused on the heist only, the film could have been a tight entertainer though a copy of a Hollywood movie. The biggest flaw of the film was the very regular type cast characters, like Deepika Padukone, Abhishek Bachchan, Jackie Shroff, or Shahrukh Khan himself. The characters and their jokes or emotions don't offer much of novelty. Despite this, the film remains partly watchable for the nice flow maintained in the story and nice songs and dance numbers. Anyway, this is not a movie I would love to watch again.Rating: 2 stars out of 4",5,0,0,27 December 2014
Sully," Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks come with a revered film on real life incident....
","'Sully' depicts the real life incident involving the ditching of US Airways Airbus A320 on Hudson River saving the lives of 155 passengers and crew which is considered one of the miraculous survivals responding to an efficient crew resource management. Anyone like me with a strong urge for aviation will heartily take this movie important which salutes the professionalism brought to the screen by the flight crew.Clint Eastwood, one of the revered actors and directors of all time, does it again drifting from his usual genre of fictitious stories, to capture the prompt decision the cockpit crew take. The film is based on real statistics and investigation which avoids sentimentality or drama unlike Denzil Washington's 'Flight' (a good thriller) which fictionalized the real life accident into a heroic survival game receiving Oscar accolades. In that case, the film remains subdued with yet an another revered performance as a controlled captain of Airbus A320 showing the patience, diligence, and dedication of a senior captain equally supported by Aaron Eckhart as the first officer. Don't worry if the film didn't sweep major Oscar nominations, it's a sincere film on a heroic deed worth watching.Rating: 3 stars out of 4",7,3,3,22 October 2017
The Martian," A smart, nearly flawless sci-fi.......
","Science fiction has been one of the genres churned out many times, most turning into capers with few exceptions like Apollo 13 or Gravity. 'The Martian' isn't a caper nor does it delve into the sentimentality of 'Apollo 13' or 'Gravity.' It's simply a clever and entertaining sci-fi drama that contemplates the scientific facts meticulously. The story seems more for pleasing the crowd rather than accomplishing a rich literary work; but whatever it does seem flawless and detailed for which the film becomes gripping throughout despite its over length. Based on a novel of the same title, the film pretty enriches your knowledge on astronomy for which it can serve a very good resourcce. Matt Damon in the title role steals the show using much of wit to his role, avoiding sentimentality, and above all, tries something different than the desolation portrayed by Tom Hanks in Cast Away or Leonardo Di Caprio in 'The Revenant.' His role is pretty fun filled and amusing; a memorable performance he has given in recent years after 'The Departed.' A superb narration, brilliant camera work, and a nice performance definitely make it a smart and entertaining movie of the year though the subject and treatment might not feel a regular Oscar worthy material.Rating: 2.5 stars out of 4",7,6,8,31 March 2016
