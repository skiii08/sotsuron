Blade Runner 2049," Shouldnt have touched it
","I did not realise 2049 also was the actual length of the film! It sure felt like it! 3 hours of boring dialogue, hollow characters and an embarrassingly weak story. Hard to believe Ridley Scott really made this!The first Blade Runner worked the pace of the film brilliantly up to the powerful ending. The story was a rather simple sci-fi noir detective story with a twist. It made some huge comments on humanity and what kind of future we want. It worked on so many levels. It could be viewed as a simple sci-fi detective story or as a great spiritual journey that asked all the big questions. 'And what can your maker do for you?'.",6,1,4,2 January 2018
The Maze Runner," Enjoyable but not brilliant
","The Maze Runner story isn't one of the brilliants I have seen, it is interesting enough to satisfy my interest. Opening scene is intriguing and wakes your interest to wait to see what to come. Story itself is many times seen in various movies, but citation to such movies as Cube and TV- Biggest problem is the movie casting. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) is interesting character enough, but Will Boultier as villain of story is too lame personality. And somehow I don't understand the meaning of Teresa's (Kaya Scolecario) character who seem to pointless for the whole story. Maybe her role for the story grows and clears at the forthcoming movies. Sequel is coming next fall. After all great scenery combined with intensive storytelling is fresh enough to bring this movie a little bit more interesting, than most of those Hollywood's post-apocalyptic serial productions these days.",7,0,0,8 February 2018
The Matrix," Conspiracy theorists dream
","Let's just forget for a second all the star actors in this one. The script and the way the story unfolds is just magnificent. It is so perfect and strange in way that you could ask yourself 'Was that written from humans?' Almost 20 years later, this is still in my top 10 favorite movies of all time. I have watched it a dozen times and every time I see something different that have missed before. A must watch movie for every open minded sci fi brain out there. Is this the future of man kind explained in fiction. Remember 1984.",9,0,2,19 February 2018
