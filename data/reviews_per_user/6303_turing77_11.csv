Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," My God, was this film awful.
","Like everyone else, I looked forward to this movie, and was excited to see it. However, with the exception of George Lucas' family (and employees), any person who has seen TPM should be honest enough to admit that it sucks. It sucks long, and it sucks hard. The writing and direction are simply awful, and no amount of technical or visual legerdemain can redeem that. The saddest thing is that TPM (and the even worse Attack of the Clones) diminish the original trilogy. George, you had your billions: you should have left well enough alone.",Null,0,1,8 January 2004
The Big Lebowski," Big Lebowski=Big Laughs
","Jeff Bridges is a likable actor. Here he gets a tailor-made role: The Dude. This film never misses a beat or sounds a wrong note. From start to finish, it is a hilarious journey with wonderful characters: the German nihilists, the Eagles-loving cabbie, the Hispanic pedophile bowler, the crippled namesake of The Dude, the cripple's lackey, and Walter. The cast is uniformly superb, the Coens know exactly what they are doing, and the result is a film to savor.",Null,1,2,8 January 2004
Barry Lyndon," Kubrick at the height of his powers.
","Some people don't like this film. Some people think Carrot Top is funny. What're you gonna do? Barry Lyndon is a flawless movie. It has a perfect story-arc (focusing on Redmond Barry), perfect direction, and the best photography I've ever seen. Kubrick recreates the era so authentically that the viewer is immediately drawn into the narrative. The cast performs admirably (it is the best work Ryan O'Neal will ever do), and the film's length only adds to the richness.",Null,1,2,8 January 2004
The Thing," What a Horror Movie Should Be
","Remakes today are seemingly ubiquitous in Hollywood. Most of them are unnecessary (e.g. Alfie), or unwarranted (e.g. Dawn of the Dead), and damned near every single one is crap. But there is always the exception to the rule: John Carpenter's The Thing is the exception to the Iron Law of Remakes. It goes off in a different direction than Howard Hawks' Thing (which is trite 'Doctor, look at the geiger counter!' 1950s rubbish), but stays more faithful to the original source material. This film is a horror masterpiece, without flaws, false notes, or counterfeit nonsense that makes the viewer say to himself 'Oh yeah, I'm watchin' a movie.' The script is taut, the acting superb, the credibility factor unassailable, and the special effects tremendous. I don't think Hollywood realizes just how artificial and awful CGI is. The effects in The Thing are gross, gory, and organic, and they never made me shake my head once. Let's put it this way: the 1982 special effects for The Thing do the job they're supposed to do--tell the story--better than anything George Lucas and his oodles of nerd-loot managed twenty years later. This is a film to own, and I can't sing its praises enough. Last point: I've seen the movie numerous times, and know how the plot works out...but the film is so well-made, such a classic, that I'll stick with it if I chance upon it on cable because it's that good (cf. 'The Godfather).",10,0,1,25 October 2005
American Beauty," Completely Unremarkable
","American Beauty is not a bad film. It is not, however, a particularly good one either. It is a serviceable filmic bildungsroman, but it is so highly overrated that a backlash was inevitable. This is certainly not a classic, nor a film that will be remembered a decade from now.",Null,2,4,8 January 2004
Aliens," We all know how good this is.
","If anyone ever asks for an example of a sequel that is superior to the original, this is your film. Jim Cameron is one of the best directors working today, and this film is his, pure and simple. The subsequent two films (not directed by Cameron) were pretty bad, but this one stands alone. Sigourney Weaver gives a perfect performance, and the rest of the cast is terrific, especially Bill Paxton. This movie never lets you down: once the fantastical elements of the story are established, you believe the characters, you accept their behavior, and you think you are watching 'reality.' A true classic.",Null,0,0,16 February 2004
American History X," What might have been?
","There was a classic lurking in American History X. Too bad it never materialized. Ed Norton has talent, and here he showcases it to a large, albeit uneven, extent. Stacy Keach is spot-on, and, I hate to say it, but Ed Furlong turns in a pretty good performance. Too bad the acting was scuppered by the script. (I know about the controversy involved with the director, and would hate to think that this film was screwed up for no other reason than dueling egos.) The film starts strong, but devolves into an after-school special. Ed Norton's transformation is wholly unbelievable---a prison gang-rape is a heckuva road-to-Damascus moment--and the writing becomes obnoxiously pat. This film has a 'message', but, ironically, the tone makes it unpalatable. Too bad.",Null,0,1,29 January 2004
The Usual Suspects," Almost perfect.
","This film should have won Best Picture in 1995. I don't know which film did win, but it wasn't as good as this. You cannot predict the plot, you cannot predict the outcome, and you are drawn out of yourself and into the story for the entire duration of the film. One to own.",Null,1,2,19 February 2004
Independence Day," A giant piece of crap.
","Why was there no sequel to this (financially) successful movie? I'll tell you why: 'cause it wouldn't have made a nickel. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice...ID4 is an overblown, ridiculous, stupid, insulting piece of drek that was marketed brilliantly. Of course, everyone saw for themselves how awful the movie actually was (akin to Godzilla...now I wonder if there's a connection?).",Null,1,3,18 January 2004
The Thin Red Line," The Thin Red Line is to Saving Private Ryan as Citizen Kane is to My Baby's Daddy
","Terence Malick is a brilliant guy who has no concern for fame whatsoever. These are two qualities that can make for a true auteur and truly good movies. This film is a masterpiece: slow, sedate, contemplative, and unhurried. The cast is remarkable, especially Jim Caviezel, and the direction superb. Nick Nolte has three seconds in this film where he reaches the pinnacle of film acting. (You should be able to spot them easily.) Just an excellent film, all around.",Null,0,0,8 January 2004
Gangs of New York," Scorsese directed this?
","This film is a disappointment. The story is incoherent, the editing rather slipshod, and DiCaprio is not, shall we say, credible in his role. Daniel Day-Lewis is spot-on, as is Brendan Gleeson, but they can't save this film by themselves. A misfire, all together.",Null,0,1,13 January 2004
