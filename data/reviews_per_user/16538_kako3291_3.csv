Black Swan," Just.. Amazing
","I don't know if I'm going to be able to put in words my admiration for this movie. Acting was superb. Portman's portrayal as Nina embodies Bullock's role in Blind Side, and I truly believe that it will get her not only an Oscar nomination, but also the win. And Mila Kunis comes out of no where (believe me, I liked her ever since That 70s Show, but this brings her to the upper tiers of actresses to be considered for many significant roles to come) and she deserves the Oscar for supporting actress as well. The movie in entirety is just breathtaking, fascinating, intriguing and suspenseful. Great directing, just a great movie! It kept my entire attention from the first scene to the last, and the last is what really brought this movie to it's height. So much to connect, and a lot of analyze (it's an English major's dream, so I'm in heaven right now). But brava Portman and Kunis. And brava Black Swan. 2010 = Inception & Black Swan as some of the best movies of the year and in decades.",10,5,11,20 December 2010
500 Days of Summer," (500) Days.. that everyone can relate to.
","I was blown away by this movie. Don't get me wrong, I love these kind of movies (more of an indie feel), but I never could call one of them a must-see, besides maybe Juno, but (500) Days of Summer surpasses that by far. The acting is superb, the story is great, but it's the ending that sold me. However, behind the scenes is what really gives this movie an extra edge; the directing. The layout of this movie, the camera shots, just so much is so different, but so good! There is one instant when you're watching two depictions of the same scene, the main role's expectations and the reality. So smart. In the beginning, the narrator says that this isn't a love story. In more ways than one, it truly isn't. However, in that one aspect it's a love story that everyone knows...that first love. Or that love you're hesitant about. Everyone should take an evening to watch this, you will honestly not be disappointed. If you still aren't sure, I place this movie as my third favorite right behind Shawshank Redemption and Schindler's List just so you believe I have a good taste in movies!",9,3,4,18 March 2010
Shutter Island," Martin and Leo Belong Together...
","I was 50/50 about this movie when I began watching it. This is obviously a great director/lead actor duo (which is obvious in Gangs of New York, The Aviator, and The Departed), but this just didn't seem like a typical movie for either of the two. But Scorsese's creativity and talent really shines in this thriller. There are turns and twists that, even though I knew I should be anticipating some, I truly did not see coming. Leo makes his role believable and Kingsley really adds to the suspense. I could have done without Ruffalo, but he was decent, if not kind of good. If you're not into these kind of movies, I still suggest you give Shutter Island a chance. It's a great movie and definitely will be one of the best thrillers in our time. Lastly, the ending will blow you away.",8,1,7,22 February 2010
