Mission: Impossible III," Tom Cruise + Action + Impossible has always worked
","Well by far MI-1 was the best movie ever in MI series. IT has suspense and drama in it, with a lot of realistic action. Although this was not the case in MI-3, where the suspense element is almost gone as it was the case in MI-2 but the action is fantastic. And in my views MI-3 is better the MI-2 . It has better Action and perhaps the better plot. plus in MI-2 the movie revolved around just one guy ETHUN, where as in MI-3 its more of a teamwork. If i have to give Rating out of 10 to MI series it will be like thisMI-1: 9 ------------ MI-2: 7 ------------ MI-3: 8In the End, I will Strongly Recommend everyone to see this MOVIE MI-3",9,2,4,7 May 2006
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," I liked the pace of this movie - Jackman rocks as always
",In my view this was one of the Best X-Men Movies if not the best. The starts with a Bang ... one of the best starts with great background music to complement the starting sequence. Overall all the character in this movie are well composed. I like the way Victor was put together in this movie. he really put up a strong show. Rest all other X-Men did well but were overshadowed by Wolverine and Victor but that what the movie was all about ... the origion of wolverine. I m a Big fan of Jackman. He really deliver his best. Movies like X-Men and Ven Helsing are type of movies that show his true character. A must watch film. forget about people who say this movie is a flop. Just go and watch it. You won't be disappointed. I can bet.,10,35,59,18 May 2009
