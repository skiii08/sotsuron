The Longest Yard," Now if only Adam Sandler would make a football movie...
","It's a measure of how truly terrible is 'The Longest Yard' that star Adam Sandler, no stranger to awful, awful movies, seems throughout to want desperately to be elsewhere. I've never been a fan of most of Sandler's films, but seeing him stuck in a movie this cut-rate, lazy, and uninspired almost makes me feel sorry for the guy. He's always tended toward the lowbrow, but drags himself through this abomination with the apparent realization that such crap is beneath even his meager standards. A film in which a football player pops steroids from a bottle labeled 'STEROIDS' unambiguously reveals its regard for its audience. This is by far one of the year's worst movies, and it's only June.I didn't laugh once during this film. Not a single time. Not at the crew of cross-dressing, cheer leading prison bitches, not at the 300lb black guy with the IQ and demeanor of a little girl, and certainly not at poor Chris Rock, trotted out to highlight yet again the rib-tickling differences between blacks and whites. 'The Longest Yard' can't come up with even one character worth caring about in any regard, neither through sympathy nor laughter.Sandler fills the unlikely role of former NFL MVP Paul Crewes. Already on parole from a point-shaving scandal, he's soon a poor man's Cool Hand Luke in a southern pokie after leading police on a drunken, high speed chase. Conveniently for Crewes, this particular prison is essentially just a side show to the obsession of the warden; the 'semi-pro' guards' football team. Crewes is soon quickly enlisted to head an inmate squad on which the guards can beat up in a pre-season scrimmage. Hilarity ensues. At least that's the idea.A consistently, even occasionally funny movie could be forgiven for presenting a prison in which inmates can do whatever they feel like as long as it's football-related. 'The Longest Yard' seems to be shooting for an 'Animal House in leg irons'-type dynamic, but here characters who are able to break into the warden's office to peruse prisoner files and wander wherever they want are simply requirements of the ridiculous plot. Are there no rules or guards anywhere? Oh, that's right; they're too busy training for the big game against the ragtag team of cons, which of course is being nationally televised on ESPN 2, complete with snipers on the stadium perimeter and color commentary by Chris Berman.Sandler at least seems to be enjoying himself in most of his movies, regardless of their dubious merit. Yet here he's withdrawn enough to qualify as a straight man, which is certainly not why he gets 20 million per. 'The Longest Yard has the half-assed reek of a contractual obligation. If it can't even muster the enthusiasm of its star, it certainly can't ask for more from us. The only thing more disgraceful than this turd is the killing it will surely make at the box office.",1,0,2,2 July 2005
Hostel," Is Eli Roth a jackass, or is it just his characters?
","Eli Roth is either a satirist with an amazing poker face, or 12 years old. The man responsible for the execrable 'Cabin Fever' is back now with 'Hostel,' another Dead Teenager movie. While the thought of anyone enjoying any aspect of the stinky 'Cabin Fever' made one weep for the species, 'Hostel' is a notch or two above that moist pile of rankness. Yet it's still an ugly, ugly movie.First off, what is it with Roth and the 'gay' epithets? He populated his first film with smarmy rich kids who called each other 'gay' with every other breath, as if 1987 (indeed a fine year) had never ended. Now here's 'Hostel,' with its dopey frat types backpacking through Europe, dropping the casual g-bomb like it's gone out of style. A memo to Roth: IT HAS. As in 'Cabin Fever,' Roth has presented us with such loathsome characters that we're almost glad to see them get what he has in store for them. 'Hostel''s young jerkoffs seem like the types to take such a clichéd coming of age trip just to prove their masculinity to their brothers back home. I'm beginning to form a picture of Roth as a once-persecuted bookworm made good, who now can get back at all his childhood bullies and their 'gay' taunts in multiplexes nationwide. I really hope I'm onto something, as the alternative implies that Roth is simply as retarded as his characters.But anyway, there's a movie here. Our two young homophobes are Finding Themselves on a tour of the whorehouses of Europe, along with a giddy Icelandic drifter who would likely be played by Peter Stormare in an older, and much better, film. A guy in their hostel in Amsterdam quickly pegs them for the dumb f**ks they are and tells them about a joint in Bratislava; 'girls you won't believe,' 'will do anything,' 'love Americans,' etc. Of course they're on the next train, and find themselves in the titular hostel, which is conveniently populated exclusively with young, nubile women of the type normally found online. The DKE brothers are beside themselves, doing everything short of shouting 'boobies!' outright (and I can't even be sure that doesn't happen at some point). Drinks are laced, and the Greeks find themselves in one of those dank, wet movie basements in which the only thing not covered in grime is the glistening row of saws, drills, scalpels, and other instruments that are generally preceded with a stern call of 'nurse' Turns out one can still play the Most Dangerous Game in Slovakia, except the rules have evolved so that the prey is now handcuffed to a chair. I can't wish these gory punishments doled out by the unfeeling rich on anyone, but Roth really seems to dislike his characters, and wants us to as well. If that's the case, he has a lot of bottled up anger to deal with. If not, he's simply a sadist. Either way, 'Hostel' is cloaked in a weighty unpleasantness that makes it hard to enjoy its few nice touches.Roth occasionally flirts with statement-making in 'Hostel.' In his pay-to-torture men's club, taking one's aggression out on an internationally-despised American will cost considerably more than hacking up, say, a Russian or European. The idea of the socially numb elite dropping mad coin to slice people up just to feel something echoes, well, all of 'Fight Club.' Roth has some pretty usable material here, but is more interested in icky shock thrills than social commentary. By the end, our lucky survivor has gotten revenge on a character he couldn't possibly have known was involved, and we wonder exactly what is the point of 'Hostel.' It can be summed up in two of the film's favorite terms (after 'gay'): 'jugs!' and 'ahhhgh!'",3,25,50,8 February 2006
Crash," 'Magnolia' with racism instead of frogs
","'Crash' has aspirations of being an operatic saga of racial resentment and misplaced aggression. With its large cast of characters whose stories occasionally intersect and bounce off one another like bumper cars, it recalls 'Magnolia' and '2 Days In the Valley,' but seriously lacks the substance to fill out the heft of its ambitions. A film this dedicated to race needs to have something urgent to say, but 'Crash' is mostly content with a series of broad sketches, injected with some truly troubling notions of racism and its effects.We're introduced to a large assembly of characters, most of whom go unnamed, or whose names are mentioned only in passing. We're all victims and all aggressors, the film is telling us; what do names matter? There's the district attorney and his wife who are carjacked by two black thugs who wax poetic about constantly being taken for thugs. The honest Chicano locksmith always seems to incur his customers' wrath in spite of his solid work. There's the rageful racist cop who, after seeing his father denied medical coverage by a black HMO receptionist, takes it out on a couple of innocent, affluent black motorists. 'Crash' keeps its huge cast in check only by treating them as ciphers. The only notable attribute displayed by any one of them is to be a victim or perpetrator of misplaced racial anger, and in many cases both.What disturbs about 'Crash' is its assertion that race continues to divide us not through the enduring power and harm of stereotypes and misconceptions, but by how true such stereotypes often are. Are we by now so conditioned with knee-jerk rejections of such types that we've become blind to the dangers they underscore? There are several 'but what about?' moments that give doubt to the film's intentions. Of course the vast majority of young black men are not gangbangers and criminals, but what about the characters played by Ludicrous and Larenz Tate, who are? Clearly most Caucasian LAPD patrolmen are not Mark Furman-like white devils, but what about Matt Dillon, who thrills to molesting a black woman in front of her husband at a traffic stop? I don't think 'Crash' wants us to take such incidents at face value, but it lingers on them long enough to suggest that, well, black thugs and white racist cops ARE the problem, rather than the tragic symptoms of far deeper sociological pathologies.Ultimately, the film hopes to illustrate that we're all guilty, yet capable of redemption. While many of its more loathsome characters find some measure of humanity, several of the more upstanding have, by the end, fallen victim to their own unsuspected prejudices. It's difficult to care much one way or the other, though. Such thinly-drawn characters have put nothing at stake for us. Their sins and redemptions, no matter how grandiose, feel distant and hollow. In trying to be all things to all people, 'Crash' ends up being little of anything. It's on to something with the uncomfortable questions about race relations upon which it touches, but is just trying to swallow whole a subject that demands small bites, and a lot of chewing.",5,1,3,28 May 2005
Corpse Bride," The Nightmare After the Nightmare Before Christmas
","Tim Burton's 'Corpse Bride' is a Gothic tale of a sensitive young man who chafes at the distinctions between living and dead. Considering that pretty accurately describes Burton's previous 'The Nightmare Before Christmas,' and that 'Corpse Bride' is animated in the same stop-motion style, the gloomy director seems to be creating a sub-sub genre all his own. It's too bad he didn't take the time to flesh out (no pun intended. Seriously) 'Corpse Bride' a bit.There's a lot of visual invention in this film  not surprising in a Burton effort  but Tim and team seem to have spent all their energy on the visuals of 'Corpse Bride,' not noticing that their story is patchy and scatter shot. Young Victor and Victoria are introduced by their domineering parents just one day before their arranged marriage. Surprisingly enough, they quite like each other, making it all the more tragic when Victor takes a walk in the Dark Scary Woods to practice the vows he keeps flubbing in rehearsal. The film then settles into a standard 'Boy Practices Vows, Boy Unwittingly Marries Rotting Girl Cadaver, Boy Tries to Escape from Land of Dead and Anthropomorphic-Maggot-Infested Girl' story. It's here the film gets all muddled. It takes a while to establish that Victor is trapped in what we're belatedly told is the land of the dead. Except he and his late honey can cast a spell that allows them to go back to the land of the living. And the entire population of the underworld later decides to pop upstairs because, um, they feel like it. We find out that poor bride to be Emily was killed  somehow, for some reason  while waiting for her intended in the very wooded spot where Victor makes his ill-conceived marital declaration. Although fated to lie in wait for her betrothed to declare his love, she also apparently lives in the bustling world below, which appears to be a pretty hip place to spend eternity, with its be-bopping jazz cat skeletons and party-on atmosphere. Meanwhile, on the surface, poor Victoria is about to be forced into marrying wealthy, and likely homicidal, Lord Barkis.This stuff seems not very well thought out. 'Corpse Bride' has flashes of inspiration, and some moments of sharp wit. Victoria's mother, breathlessly told by her daughter that Victor and a dead girl climbed through her window, scolds 'he was in your ROOM?!' And Victor's own harried mother can't imagine 'what corpse would want to marry our Victor.' Yet for the most part, 'Corpse Bride' seems to be making things up as it goes along. Being animated, it feels obligated to sprinkle in a few entirely forgettable songs, as well, interrupting what little narrative flow it establishes.A lot of work and care goes into a film like this. Unfortunately, the only thing of which 'Corpse Bride' seems sure is how it wants to look. It's easy to admire the craftsmanship behind the film, but no amount of technical expertise can make up for a movie that's just largely so unclear and uninteresting.",5,2,7,22 October 2005
The Hills Have Eyes," ...and they should use them to watch a better movie
","'The Hills Have Eyes' continues several bothersome contemporary trends. The fact that it's yet another remake of a 'classic' 70s horror flick is at this point no surprise. Sure, when there are folks out there like M. Night Shyamalan and Lucky McKee who are producing original and effective scares, the sheer laziness of all this rehashing seems particularly offensive and tiresome. But what's truly troubling about films like 'The Hills Have Eyes' is their seeming embrace of extreme brutality for its own sake.Not having seen Wes Craven's original, I'm at a loss for comparison. I imagine a parable about the effects of US nuclear policy, though, would have packed much more topical resonance in the 70s. As it is, there are just a lot of things about this new version that make very little sense. Like why the film adopts a deliberate look and feel of decades past (the protagonists tow around an old-school Airstream trailer), but makes sure we know its characters are cell phone-equipped. Or what we're supposed to make of the nuclear mutants who stalk our unsuspecting travelers. 'You made us what we've become,' gurgles one from a bloated, twisted face. I don't know my history well enough to be sure when the last nuclear tests were in the American Southwest, but I know it was a while ago. Are we to assume they've just been happily reproducing through the years, even though sterility is one of the major effects of radiation? Otherwise, they should be elderly mutants. Or more likely, dead. And is it reasonable to believe that the dummy town they inhabit, presumably a former test site in a blast radius, would still be equipped with posed mannequins for post-blast study? There are too many silly inconsistencies with which to take issue. Possibly aware of this, 'The Hills Have Eyes' does its best to plumb new depths of graphic violence. It's a particular fan of the Axe To The Head maneuver, which it deploys no fewer than three times. My issue isn't with such violence per se, but with the ends for which it's used. 'The Hills Have Eyes' appears most interested in revolting us, which is very different from wanting to scare us, and a different species entirely from making us think. The film seems to fancy itself an updated allegory, but a throat-stabbing with an American flag does not a satire make.I suppose it can be argued that the political and social extremes defining the current times are now being reflected pro rata in arts and entertainment; that increasing grotesquerie in movies is simply another facet of a culture currently debating to what inhuman lengths it will go in the name of safety and security. But films like 'The Hills Have Eyes' play the insidious trick of cloaking themselves loosely with the language of social commentary and satire, without making a genuine effort to engage in them. Such dishonesty is the last thing we need these days.",3,0,2,23 April 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Blessedly semen-free
","It would seem self-evident that certain things should be avoided during sex, simulated or otherwise: braces, pastries, super glue, zippers. All these items scream Sex Comedy, though, and have featured prominently in big Hollywood scores (no pun intended) in recent years. These flicks have managed to be more or less consistently pretty funny, although getting audience guffaws at the sheer relief of watching mortifying things happen to other people during sex seems like pinning the tail on the donkey with no blindfold. Regardless, now comes 'The 40 Year Old Virgin,' gamely continuing the palliative formula of sticking our collective carnal neuroses on some schmucky loser, and reaping the rewards of our horrified laughter.'Virgin' succeeds largely on the dopey antics of star Steve Carrell, who makes an art form of creating comic centerpieces out of straight men. As Andrew, the titular touch-me-not, Carrell chortles and wheedles his way through innumerable conversations on which he has no expertise with an incompetent evasiveness worthy of Jeff Lebowski. A film that takes its central gag as its title is clearly not into wasting time, and 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' rapidly settles into a series of sketches of ill-advised attempts to enter poor Andrew into the world of the violated. There's a disastrous round of speed-dating, a pick up lesson ('just keep asking questions,' advises Andrew's buddy), and a transvestite hooker, all of which mostly comes off as standard, i.e. not very funny, fare. Even less amusing is 'Virgin''s insistence on detouring into unnecessary gay jokes, as well as the two caricatured Pakistani coworkers whose only function is to sound funny talking in heavily-accented street patois.Carrell himself, though, is funny, and 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' is at its best when focusing on Andrew himself, rather than his pratfalls or cadre of Wacky Friends. The painfully transparent false confidence with which he equates a breast with a bag of sand, for example, or tells a bar floozy 'I hope you have a big trunk, because I'm putting my bike in it' is far more restrained and subtly hilarious than any of the genre's more preferred 'semen in a' gags. The film is smart to go light on the scatology (at least in comparison to its predecessors), instead finding much of its humor in the pathologies of involuntary celibacy. Bike-riding, action figure-collecting Andrew has a lot in common with Steve Buscemi's obsessive schlump from 'Ghost World,' though he does at times appear as much a victim of bad luck as of a defective personality.'The 40 Year Old Virgin' is nothing new, but does its thing well, and is a perfect stage for Carrell's deadpan histrionics. The ability to elevate basically mundane material is a too rare gift with which Carrell is evidently blessed. Let's hope Hollywood notices.",6,2,4,19 September 2005
Spider-Man," The greatest advance for mucuous since the booger.
","The last few years have been tough for old-school Sam Raimi fans. It's not that he's disappeared - to the contrary, Raimi has been quite busy lately with some high-profile projects. Neither is it that those projects were crap. Well, `For Love of the Game' probably was. But `A Simple Plan' was a masterful change of pace from Raimi's usual ADHD-inflected style. Even `The Gift,' considerable flaws notwithstanding, was a beautiful evocation of mood and atmosphere. The problem is that the Sam Raimi of old has himself gone on extended leave. Over the years, he's gradually moved away from the manic energy and gleeful cheesiness that made `Darkman' and the `Evil Dead' movies so much fun (in particular, `Army of Darkness,' one of the greatest movies to be made since prehistoric man first picked up a camera).It was all the more exciting, therefore, to hear that Raimi would be helming `Spider-Man' (pretty much the only news that could ease the disappointment that the `James Cameron to direct, Bruce Campbell to star' rumors were untrue). Such source material would seem rife with opportunities for moving object-cam shots and stupid, wiseass dialogue. Indeed, Raimi's fun gene does seem to have been reawakened by his latest project. In many ways, he's got the right idea of how to approach a `Spider-Man' film. Unfortunately, a combination of fanzine-level writing and silly costume design leave us with a `Spider-Man' that's less Marvel comics and more Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Tobey Maguire is a good choice for Peter Parker, the wimpy high school nerd who develops the fortuitous alter ego. While on a field trip to the Nuclear Spiders Lab, or wherever, Parker gets nipped by one of the little neon-colored nasties that escapes from its cage. As we all can attest from our own experiences with creature bites, superhuman powers are not far behind for Parker, including the power to shoot sticky mucilage from his wrists (creator Stan Lee made the wise decision in the original comic not to have him secrete silk from his ass). This, along with his newfound ability to scale walls, inspires him. Why not make a few bucks as an amateur wrestler? Alas, more pressing matters are soon vying for Parker's attention, transforming him from `the Human Spider' the wrestler into Spider-Man the superhero in the process. There's a green guy in a metal suit that's been flying around blowing things up, and he needs to be stopped. It's here that `Spider-Man' begins to let things spin out of control (no pun intended). Early on, Raimi has the patience to let Parker slowly discover and master his powers, deftly echoing more worldly teenage self-discoveries and rites of passage. But by the time Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin shows up, Raimi seems to be looking at his watch, wondering how he's going to pack everything into the running time. The Goblin turns out not to have any particular plan, other than to generally wreck stuff, and to say things like `nobody says no to me!' and `time to die!' Dafoe's uncanny resemblance to a chimpanzee, when not dressed as an evil head of broccoli, doesn't help matters. Then there's Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). Poor Mary Jane. How could a character named after pot be so extraneous, so empty? Dunst bounces through no fewer than three men in `Spider-Man,' and is indeed helpless the few times she's away from them. By the end of the film, when she's finally realized - through a kiss - that the masked hero with the same build and voice as Peter Parker is, in fact, Peter Parker, and has confessed her love for the non-Amazing half of that dichotomy, Raimi has put in place the comic book ending, nearly line-for-line, that wrapped things up in `Darkman.' It's another indication of the director straining mightily for his roots, and being unable to grasp them firmly. Oh well - it's a step in the right direction, at least.",Null,0,0,19 May 2002
Jarhead," Waiting is hell
","Everybody knows that war is hell. 'Jarhead' wants us to know that waiting around for war isn't so great, either, especially when one is forced to do it from within a testosterone factory, full of young men who have been led to believe that they'll be shooting some dark-skinned, moustachioed types any minute. It's enough to make you crazy.Enough to make Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenahll) crazy, at least. It doesn't take long for Swofford to second-guess his decision to enlist in the Marines. 'Jarhead' opens with a sort of homage to the famous Paris Island portion of Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket.' No tragic murder-suicide in this case, but around when his drill sergeant starts slamming heads into walls and shouting about his sexuality, Swofford begins to assume a glazed, jaded look. He's as excited as anyone else when his unit is ordered to Kuwait as part of Operation Desert Shield, though predicts on the plane that they'll be back before they've digested their complimentary peanuts. He whoops and hollers with everyone else at a rousing speech by the commanding officer full of references to 'the bureaucrats in Washington,' kicking Iraqi ass, and other soldierly musings.But the ass-kicking doesn't seem to materialize. There's plenty of running around in the desert, target practice, and football games. Swofford's Staff Seargeant (Jaime Foxx) loves to pull surprise gas raid drills. A few of these 'jarheads,' though, are sharp enough to notice that reality on the ground is quite a bit different than the official line, parroted gleefully by a lot of their comrades who can't wait to start killing Arabs. It's this cognitive dissonance that's at the heart of director Sam Mendes' movie. These guys have been pumped full of military hokum about the mysticism of their rifles, being killing machines, and the importance of the Corps, but life in the desert is largely consumed by domestic issues back home, and the killing of nothing more than time. There's a pressure-cooker of aggression here that's got no release valve. Swofford, at least, begins to lose his bearings. He shoves his gun in a comrade's face, and when the bombs do start falling, he can only stand there in a daze. As one marine points out, though, the war moves way too fast for troops on the ground. By the time they get mobilized, air strikes have pushed the front miles further back. Even the sight of a charred Iraqi convoy, strafed while trying to flee, arouses little emotion. The pilots are actually fighting the war; the grunts on the ground just sort of hang around it.'Jarhead' at times feels unfocused, but I think that's the point. Combat and killing are psychologically scarring, but so is preparing people for such, then leaving them to wait in uncertainty. Back home in a victory parade, a Vietnam vet hops on the unit's bus to offer congratulations personally. He sits down, clearly having a moment of profound emotional connection with these new returnees. Swofford seems both to understand completely and feel miles apart. Combat isn't the only terrible thing war has to offer. While perhaps less intense in the moment, the buildup, aftermath, and peripherals exact a psychological toll as well, and create their own demons.",8,0,1,14 December 2005
Ocean's Eleven," A wasted opportunity that should be much more fun than it is
","Ocean's Eleven`Ocean's Eleven' is like a party with no beer. All the elements for a great time are in place - fun folks, nice scenery, a lighthearted mood. But no one there will have the cubes to let loose and have a really good time without a little help from the friendly neighborhood liquor store. In this case, the beer is the script, and it's far less substantive than a pint of Guiness, although possibly more thick-headed. I guess the draw for all the big names above the title was the chance to work with a lot of other big names, but even toned, finely tanned celebrity bungholes can't make crap smell like potpourri. Everyone is trying way too hard to prove they can relax and have a good time. It's a shame, because there's far too much talent here for this film to be so flat and uninteresting. George Clooney is Danny Ocean, yet another thief who begins planning a job immediately after being paroled. Ripping off a few casinos seems like a good idea because A) they're owned by the greaseball who's tagging his ex-wife, and 2) he'll need a large cast of famous actors, each with a criminal forte, to help him do it. Matt Damon is the best pickpocket in the country. Don Cheadle not only knows explosives, but is also the only living Cockney who translates his rhyming slang for the tragically un-hip. Elliot Gould is the financier. And Brad Pitt is the fleshy-jowled, perfectly stubbled co-George Clooney. Now you might think, as I did, that an eleven-man crew is a pretty large assembly for a robbery. However, this particular heist seems to have room for virtually every crime there is, and therefore room for lots of stars to commit them. They're all so at ease in their specialties, in fact, that they have plenty of time for all sorts of witty quips and bawdy ripostes. The script, unfortunately, provides them with mostly pedestrian stuff. The rhythm of their banter is so predictable, their wisecracks so telegraphed, that I wondered if anyone had actually read any of it prior to signing on. Worst of all, `Ocean's Eleven' focuses entirely on its central heist. Director Steven Soderbergh here dispenses with his trademark quick, overlapping-cuts and other directorial flair, apparently under the assumption that star power is enough. Or perhaps he didn't give this film the care of his past superb work under the pretense of `just having fun.' The heist genre is by now hackneyed enough that any flick will be just that unless one brings some new perspective to it. There's none of that here, just a lot of acid-lounge funk in the background to remind us how cool everyone and everything is. Why? Because they steal things? Poor Julia Roberts, as the highbrow object of Ocean's Affection - her choices are between a millionaire sleaze or a slick ex-con? This script never considers allowing her to make the choice that screams to be recognized in the mind of anyone watching, namely a condescending rejection of both these losers. No, her thankless role requires her to remember all over again why she fell for that piercing, over-the-brow Clooney stare in the first place. Amazing how $150 million can refresh the memory. The journey from elegant casino `curator' to the world's most expensive escort is a large one to make in two hours, but `Ocean's Eleven' proves it can be done if you don't bother with pesky character development. `Ocean's Eleven' is bound to make a box office killing, despite being released between `Harry Potter' and `The Lord of the Rings.' It will also probably be praised for allowing its all-star cast to let their pompadours down for a bit and have a good time. What it really is, though, is a colossal missed opportunity that won't define the subsequent work of anyone involved, if we're lucky.",Null,0,1,3 February 2002
Batman Begins," New, improved, and Schumacher-free!
","Christopher Nolan's 'Batman Begins' plays the dangerous game of taking itself seriously, and gets away with it. By toning down the absurd visuals  taken to hysterical extremes in the embarrassing Joel Schumacher installments  and focusing instead on the comic book themes of the Dark Knight, Nolan has injected a fresh energy into a franchise that seemed down for the count just a few years ago. Even the watchable Tim Burton efforts gave us a Batman who rarely seemed to be more than a male Paris Hilton; too much money and too much time on his hands. Christian Bale, though, brings a ferocity born of anger, confusion, and fear to the Caped Crusader. Batman is suddenly cool again.Nolan takes his time with this origin story, and packs in enough noir-ish plot to make Howard Hawkes proud. That can be a downer, especially in a summer spectacle (see 'Mission: Impossible'), but the result here is a film that doesn't need to rely on over the top set pieces to keep us involved. There are, of course, a fair share of explosions, escapes, fisticuffs, and cars jumping across Gotham rooftops, but they nearly always serve the story, rather than delay it. Even the gadgetry is kept to a supporting role. All the expected Bat-gizmos are here, but aren't given scenes included specifically to showcase them. They're almost refreshingly mundane.'Batman Begins' is smartly most interested in Bruce Wayne himself, rather than the wacky cast of villainy that opposes him. We meet him in one of those dreary Asian gulags that have housed countless action heroes over the years. After being released by a mysterious stranger (Liam Neeson) who talks like a fortune cookie writer, he finds himself training in the mountaintop fortress of the League of Shadows, an ancient vigilante group dedicated to revisiting onto the world's evildoers the cruelty with which they victimize the innocent. Creative differences soon lead our hero back to Gotham, though, and before you can say 'plot to destroy the city,' he's locking pointy ears with a burlap-wearing menace called the Scarecrow who likes to sprinkle a fear hallucinogen on folks as if it were pixie dust.The film is well-cast all around, with the awkward exception of Katie Holmes, who's far too girlish and pouty to be believable in such a grown-up atmosphere, much less in her role as a crusading assistant district attorney. Gary Oldman surprises as Sgt. (and future commish) Gordon, perhaps the most normal, well-adjusted character he's ever played, and Morgan Freeman predictably hits all the right notes with an effortless insouciance that lightens the proceedings just enough. Despite the silly affected growl he uses while in disguise, Bale is a good choice for Batman, easily convincing as a scion of wealth while hinting at a repressed, raging darkness.'Batman Begins' signals its intent to break completely from the recent earlier films, and indeed implies that villains dispatched in previous editions may make new appearances in future installments. Ignoring such wayward predecessors is a smart strategy, particularly with the establishment of such a solid new foundation. Batman is back on track. Keep Schumacher away from him.",7,0,0,28 June 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Nerds with Swords!
","I'll admit it  I gave up reading J.R.R. Tolkkien's `The Two Towers' halfway through. The book plodded for me more slowly than the anthropomorphized tree in which two of its heroes spend virtually the entire story. Peter Jackson's film of `the Fellowship of the Ring,' though, made me wonder if I'd perhaps been too impatient with the trilogy. The furious intensity and imagination he brought to that film convinced me that I dug this stuff after all. But just like those guys who dress up in chain mail and hit each other with padded swords, `The Two Towers' reminds me why I've never really gotten into fantasy. All the extraordinary production values of the first film are there  not surprising, as they were filmed at the same time  but one suspects that this installment could easily be skipped without missing the larger impact of Tolkkien's universe. The problem is that the `The Two Towers' essentially amounts to nothing more than a pointless aside in the epic trilogy of swordplay and sorcery. As expected, we pick up with our friends from Middle Earth as we left them  covered with Middle Dirt and speaking proper fantasy-inflected English, still questing to cast the One Ring of Power into the fires of Mount Doom. Along the way, hobbits Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamje pick up the dubious guide services of Gollum, a scheming creature who appears to be a CGI rendition of Willem Dafoe. The film culminates in the battle of Helms Deep, the last ditch survival effort of the race of men against the invading armies of Mordor. The scope of this spectacle flirts with the impressive, although anyone familiar with `Army of Darkness' will have a hard time suppressing a chuckle at the sweeping shots of armored ghoulies gurgling and yawning menacingly.      The puzzling bit, at least to the uninitiated, is that by the end of the film everyone is pretty much in the same place they began, giving rise to the suspicion that Tolkkien was perhaps trying to stretch this whole business a bit further than prudence would dictate  like introducing Vance and Coy on `The Dukes of Hazzard.' The film's cinematography is again breathtaking, but is left searching for material worthy of its scope. There's walking, riding (on both horse and tree), and even a bit of running, but little else to warrant the constant swooping cameras. After an hour or so, `The Two Towers' begins to feel more like a fantasy edition of National Geographic than a necessary middle chapter of what might work better as a two-part tale.",Null,0,0,19 January 2003
8 Mile," Eminem's Homage to Theatrical Street Gangs
","The hype machine surrounding `8 Mile' has been supremely effective. We've by now been assaulted with so many reports of Eminem's `auspicious,' `dazzling,' and `stunning' acting debut  read: he doesn't suck  that it's quite easy to overlook the fact that the film itself is little more than a shopworn Impossible Dream Story that's as predictable as figuring out what part of his chocolate Easter bunny Mike Tyson will eat first.     Director Curtis Hanson sure-handedly lets us know that the titular Detroit neighborhood is, as Eminem himself might put it, `more poorer than you are.' Everyone's clothes are worn, their cars rusted, their houses decrepit. Even the sky seems unable to cast more than a bleak gray upon the wretched inhabitants below. Life around 8 Mile is so miserable, in fact, that the only salvation anyone finds is in freestyle rapping. No longer does the grizzled bluesman croon about his sorrows on the corner. No barbershop quartets singing sweet harmonies into the evening as they warm their hands over burning oil drums here. No, folks in 8 Mile seem to communicate exclusively in improvised insult rhyming. Indeed, even the street gangs settle their beefs with rap battles, recalling the dancing thugs of `West Side Story' and `Breakin.' Will Jimmy `Rabbit' Smith Jr. (Eminem) come up with clever enough rhymes to win the battle at the local club, giving him a shot at a recording contract? He's Eminem  you figure it out. There's an engaging film to be made on the culture of freestyle rap battles, as showcased by last 15 or so admittedly fun minutes of `8 Mile.' Unfortunately, a tiresome and silly plot forced upon a subject that doesn't necessarily need one keeps us from getting what we really want out of the film.",Null,0,0,30 December 2002
Saw II," Brutality and boredom. A can't-miss combination!
","The 'Saw' movies are alternately quite clever and very distressing. Taken together, they constitute an endurance test of brutality. These films challenge us not to look away at least once. So it's no surprise, for those versed in the first installment, when the various expendables of 'Saw II' start digging into their own flesh, climbing into industrial ovens, and inadvertently shooting themselves in the face. These things sometimes can't be avoided.The hook of 'Saw II,' like its predecessor, is a neat trick. The victims of Jigsaw, evil mastermind extraordinaire, are given legitimate  albeit gruesome  means of escape. Likewise, the police have the keys to these deadly puzzles right in front of them, if only they knew where to look. This time, Jigsaw is captured early on, in what seems to be a suspiciously easy fashion. Sure enough, he's arranged things so that he's calling the shots, even from police custody. He's rigged a series of monitors showing Detective Eric Matthews' (Donnie Wahlberg) son trapped, with 5 or 6 others, in a house that is to a normal abode what a roach motel is to the real thing. They're slowly being poisoned, and must navigate the house to find the antidote before they start to bleed from places they shouldn't.As in the first 'Saw,' the film depends on an essentially omnipotent villain. This seems unfair; since we're dealing with god, it's a given that everyone in his clutches will be killed, horribly maimed, or otherwise put at his mercy exactly as planned. The 'thrills' of 'Saw II,' if that's the appropriate term, come not from discovering whether these people will be disgustingly done in, but simply how. That leaves us with an ultra-graphic peepshow that exists for its own sake. It's morbid fascination taken to seriously grisly extremes.Both these films are extraordinarily aggressive. They're far less interested in suspense than in making us squirm. The result are some lengthy, boring sequences of chatter between scenes of people getting offed in various death traps. There's little incentive to care about anyone when their ultimate fates are all but certain. As creative as these murder machines are (and they are creative, if you're into that sort of thing), they almost always depend upon impossible anticipation of character behavior and superhuman timing. 'Saw II' comes with a nifty little twist at the end. I guess it works as much as anything else in the movie, but the body of the film gives viewers no conceivable opportunity to work it out themselves. All the characters here are given the tools they need, if only they can figure out how to use them, but the movie doesn't give us the same benefit. 'Saw II' happens to us, rather than engaging us. With no stake in the outcome, we're turned into mere voyeurs. But the escape for audiences is hidden in plain sight as if it were one of Jigsaw's traps. It's at the back of the theater, and has a red 'EXIT' sign over it.",5,2,4,27 November 2005
Black Hawk Down," A superb battle depiction that is too stupid or afraid to explore any context
","Black Hawk DownSergeant 1st Class Norm 'Hoot' Hooten (Eric Bana) won't say anything to people who ask him why he's a soldier, why he continues to hurl himself into the chaos of battle after battle. `They won't understand,' he tells Staff Sergeant Matt Eversmann (Josh Hartnett). It's an interesting exchange that occurs toward the end of `Black Hawk Down,' one that best describes the progenitors of this empty exercise in violent imagery. Director Ridley Scott and producer Jerry Bruckheimer's attempt to bring in the Oscar bling-bling that Scott missed out on with `Gladiator' (rightfully so), and of which Bruckheimer has never been within spitting distance is, while technically superb, a thoughtless and numbing account of the disastrous 1993 US incursion into Somalia that ignores all the difficult and pressing questions the incident exposed. It's easy to be sucked in by the film's simplified account of the situation that led to the US raid of a Mogadishu marketplace. Title cards during the opening credits inform us that warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid was intercepting food shipments to the starving population, and that the US was attempting to round up Aidid and other prominent members of his militia. With this stripped-down scenario in place, `Black Hawk Down' feels free to spend the next two hours inside the firefight that that ensued when the American Delta and Ranger commandos found themselves surrounded, outnumbered, and outgunned by a hostile crowd. This lengthy second act is, to be fair, a stunning depiction of a supremely disorienting operation. Taking his cues from Steven Spielberg's re-enactment of D-day in `Saving Private Ryan,' Scott inserts his cameras directly into the battle, bombarding us with hostile action from all directions. He intercuts this with satellite and helicopter views of the battlefield, allowing us to maintain a sense of the broader conflict as we're consumed within it. It's an extraordinarily effective and controlled depiction of an operation that goes wrong almost as soon as it begins. When the Black Hawk helicopters that are supposed to be providing cover fire and monitoring the situation from above start getting hit by Somali rockets, the focus turns from grabbing Aidid and his men to covering the crash sites and evacuating casualties. Yet for all its brutal depictions of this mess, this battle is all that `Black Hawk Down' amounts to. All it needs us to know is that the black guys in ragged clothes are `hostiles.' But why would thousands of Somalis be willing to take up arms against American soldiers? Why would they fight on behalf of a warlord who is starving them? And given the absolute indifference by the US and the rest of the international community to so many other humanitarian crises, why did the US care about Aidid in particular? Did these American soldiers really think they were going into battle to relieve the suffering of the Somalis, as Eversmann opines near the beginning? How could the brass have so badly misjudged the likely resistance they would encounter? I have my ideas, but `Black Hawk Down' either doesn't, or doesn't care to share them. Scott is too preoccupied with reminding us how heroic these Americans are. They were certainly brave, and the fact that they escaped with as few deaths as they did (19) is remarkable. But are they really heroic? There is hardly a mention of Somali casualties - I was quite surprised that the film even deemed it fit to mention in its closing credits (1000 Somalis died in the battle). And there is nary a mention of the misery and destruction left behind by it all, undoubtedly exacerbated by the fact that Aidid lived to rule Mogadishu for another two years before he was killed. `Black Hawk Down' doesn't care about any of these more interesting tangents. It's like taking a trans-Atlantic flight on Virgin Airlines; you're wowed for an hour or so by all the bells and whistles before you realize that you're bored, and that your ass is more numb than a third-string quarterback's in January. It has nothing to say about this incident, other than that it happened, and that it was very bad. Is this really enough reason to have made it in the first place?",Null,0,0,3 February 2002
A Beautiful Mind," Not so beautiful
","Somewhere buried beneath all the treacly dialogue, emotional cues, and hero shots in `A Beautiful Mind' is a good film struggling to get out. To its credit, the film doesn't preach about the inherent nobility of its schizophrenic protagonist as much as it could, although it still tries to convince us that everything, even debilitating mental illness, will work out okay, as long as we believe in the Power Of Love. Robin Williams has destroyed his career with this stuff - indeed, director Ron Howard seems determined to snatch from Steven Spielberg the tainted mantle of this country's most broadly popular, and tragically wasted, filmmaking talent. Darren Aronofsky covered this same territory in `Pi' a few years ago, but stripped away the sentiment and soft-focus to emerge with a much edgier and more interesting film.      Russell Crowe is John Nash, a mathmetician-savant with some odd behavioral tics. Nash doesn't much like people, because people don't tend to warm to his erratic behavior and mumbled insults as much as they do to, say, puppies. We meet Nash as a Princeton grad student, where he is the butt of his classmates' jokes, and is in danger of flunking out for failing ever to attend class, nor even to propose a topic for his dissertation. However, as the movies have taught us, a serendipitous breakthrough is always around the corner. A gorgeous blond in a bar presents Nash with a moment of clarity, and his subsequent critique of the prevalent mathematical paradigms of the day earns him a prestigious career at MIT, and eventually catches the eye of the Pentagon. He begins to work covertly as a codebreaker for the feds, but becomes increasingly worried as the depth of his commitment is made clear. Will his shadowy government contact really keep him safe from the Russians, as promised? What will his wife think when she find out? Do his colleagues know the extent of his involvement with the government?     As expected, none of this is what it seems. Nash is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, and the boundaries between fantasy and reality suddenly come into question. `A Beautiful Mind' skillfully delivers a first-person experience of the terror and bewilderment that is schizophrenia, and has fun with Nash's own sense of humor about his illness. Russell Crowe delivers a solid performance that far surpasses his Oscar-winning turn in Gladiator (which isn't saying much), but the part has the stink of one that was written with Oscar in mind for whatever leading man of the moment was lucky enough to win it. By the time Nash's condition has been made clear, director Ron Howard is already firmly in hero-worship mode. The ennobling music and absolute poignancy with which Howard presents his story seem to dare us to exhibit anything other than utter idolatry for his subject. As Nash's wife Alicia, Jennifer Connelly is forced to utter platitudes like `I can see glimpses of the man I married, and that's enough' without rolling her eyes or vomiting stomach acid. The absurdity culminates with Nash's acceptance of the Nobel Prize, which he dedicates to Alicia for standing by him all these years, and helping him complete the journey that got him there. Indeed, a beautiful woman by my side, and even a touch of paranoid schizophrenia, would have made my own journey to the end of `A Beautiful Mind' considerably less painful.",Null,0,1,23 February 2002
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Shiny People and Shiny Things
","Full of actors pretending to be assassins pretending to be boring suburbanites, 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' never convinces that it's anything more than famous people surrounded by shiny things, and doesn't seem to be trying too hard to do so. It's as if the film is so proud of having people as pretty as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie together on screen that it figures any characters they create couldn't possibly be as interesting as, well, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' feels entitled to pile contrivance upon contrivance, at times undermining its own logic, to allow Mr. and Mrs. Pitt-Jolie to slap and tickle their way through all manner of gun play and combustion.John and Jane Smith, a couple of happily hired killers who ice skels before heading to the neighbors' cocktail party, have managed 'five or six' years of marriage without realizing the truth about each other. Well, at least one of them has. After their respective Murder, Inc's send them to the same hit, they ID one another and are each given 48 hours to eliminate the other. This is unfortunate, not least because it requires them to turn their sprawling faux colonial into bullet casserole. As far as I could tell, the only reason either heads home is to participate in a lengthy shootout in which exploding drywall serves as an aphrodisiac. It's one of many sequences in 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' that exists only for its own sake. There's a set up and a double cross that eventually lead the pair to shoot at things other than each other, and to realize that, dammit, a relationship between merciless, competing guns-for-hire CAN succeed in spite of the odds.'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' affects a forced whimsy that signals it's not to be taken seriously, but even so, virtually nothing that takes place in the film is at all necessary. One would think Charlie's Angels-type professional hit squads would be able to handle their own internal issues without conspiring with their competitors in an elaborate scheme to wipe out one of their own. Likewise, having been assigned to the relationship as a cover, it seems odd that one of the two would then be marked for death for being in that very relationship. But to heed such nitpicking would leave little cause for mayhem, and would expose the near total lack of chemistry between what admittedly must be one of the most beautiful couples ever to grace the screen. Without the able support of Vince Vaugh, here as so often the best thing in the film, 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' would be virtually humorless. It wants the taste of Brad and Angelina it dishes to us to be enough, an appalling display of laziness and condescension. If that's all you're looking for, any recent issue of People magazine can give you the same punch far less expensively.",4,6,11,16 June 2005
War of the Worlds," It's okay to fear illegal aliens
","It's nice to see Steven Spielberg having fun, which is pretty much the only point of 'War of the Worlds.' Unburdened by much in the way of politics, statements, or overarching motifs (aside from a few evocations of 9/11), Spielberg has made a theme park of destruction that can be summed up in one word: crap. Lest that sound like a criticism, though, I'll clarify; 'War of the Worlds' is quite thoroughly entertaining crap, made as well as you'll ever see it. It's fitting that the father of the summer blockbuster (with 'Jaws') has now supplied a film that is one off the purest imaginable examples of the term.Thematically speaking, I've always found Spielberg a maddening filmmaker, with his tendencies toward pathos and pandering. Yet technically he has few equals, and it's the little boy in him who is at the helm of 'War of the Worlds.' The film has no plot, beyond giant metal alien tripods  reminiscent of Spielberg's own creepy arachnid sentinels from 'Minority Report'  emerging from underground and demolishing everything in sight. Anything more would get in the way, in this case. There are plenty of satisfying long shots of spidery pods laying a big hurt on civilization, but what's most gratifying about 'War of the Worlds' is Spielberg's rediscovery of the power of suggestion. Much of the action is seen partially-framed, in reflection, or in a receding background. A giant foot or pale, ghostly light rolling over a hillside is far more intense and suspenseful than endless CGI frippery.Oddly enough, 'War of the Worlds' maintains its appeal through its sheer single-mindedness. There are no cuts to the war room here, no bold presidential directives issued through gritted teeth, and no hardscrabble resistance fighters who figure out a way to Bring The Bastards Down through old-fashioned human ingenuity. Tom Cruise's bum of a divorced dad spends most of the film having no idea what to do, or how to placate his screaming kids. Indeed, 'War of the Worlds' lets few of its characters get beyond a mad dash for survival. Tim Robbins lends a few good scenes as a would be savior of humanity who's not as together as he seems, and Cruise is efficient in his role as harried father, little to it as there is. The star here, though, is Spielberg himself, and long time cinematographer Janus Kaminski, who provides his signature washed out, blue steel look that accentuates the gloom. The only serious misstep is the decision to showcase the creatures behind the invasion, the poison apple of alien flicks that few avoid eating. They're kept to a minimum, and are fine as these things go, but are a needless distraction better left to the imagination. At least they don't look like Arabs.Overall, though, 'War of the Worlds' is extremely good at what it does, and smartly keeps its focus limited. Like Orson Welles and company in the 30s, Spielberg has brought us his apocalypse at a time of heightened xenophobia. It was the Germans then and, well, just about anybody now. Allegory aside, 'War of the Worlds' doesn't penetrate to the core of the human condition. But if you're slogging through one of those long, humid, frustrating summer days in which nothing, not even one measly car, gets crushed, catapulted, or vaporized, then this is your movie.",7,0,2,7 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," It's over. Thank god.
","With 'Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith,' it's time for those of us raised on the Star Wars franchise, we who have a certain fond attachment to the series, to acknowledge the unavoidable: these are not good films. It's easier to admit this about the first trilogy, protected against criticism as it is by the prism of nostalgia. Even the considerable mess of 'The Phantom Menace' seemed no worse than a mulligan. After providing the heroes and villains of countless childhoods, George Lucas could be forgiven for being a bit stiff after a 20 year absence. But by the time R2D2 suddenly sprouted booster rockets in 'Attack of the Clones,' something had clearly gone wrong. The saga limps over the expected finish line with 'Revenge of the Sith,' and the end is gratifying; we no longer must bear witness to the agony of something so beloved. It's the film equivalent of putting down Old Yeller.The details of the plot are as bewildering - and immaterial - as in the previous two installments. Young Jedi Anakin Skywalker races toward black helmet-dom as the Jedi Council, infinitely wise and able to read minds, yet unable to fathom the numbingly obvious, stumbles to uncover the Sith Lord manipulating galactic politics in order to rule the Republic. Perhaps Chancellor Palpatine, he of the consolidated emergency powers and sinister hiss, is involved? Perhaps the pope wears a funny hat.By this third episode, Lucas has lost any trace of cinematic patience he once displayed. There's nothing here like the slow dawning of the nature of the hulking Death Star in 'A New Hope' ('that's no moon'),or even the graceful glide of droid transports over silent grasslands in 'The Phantom Menace.' It's as if Lucas feels constrained by this last chance to blow his CGI load, and so crams every frame with as much wonder as he can muster. Even the film's quiet moments seem hyper-charged, and leave us feeling exhausted. Dialogue wooden enough to catch fire doesn't help, either.That said, pieces of 'Revenge of the Sith,' like the two previous installments, are fun to watch, and may well delight the younger set as the earlier films did a different generation. I confess to a small thrill at seeing that shiny black dome, and hearing the mechanized Vader wheeze, for the first time. 'Revenge of the Sith,' though, is ultimately more relieving than anything else. It's over, finally. Time in the Galaxy for peace, and rest.",6,3,5,23 May 2005
Lord of War," No 'Urban Legends: Bloody Mary,' but still a good effort
","To note that 'Lord of War' falls short of its ambitions is less a criticism than an acknowledgment of a good effort. Writer-director Andrew Niccol always has something to say in his films, and here he plays mad scientist, cobbling together bits of 'Goodfellas,' 'Three Kings,' 'MASH,' and a host of other seriocomic socio-political stews to create a lurching, cynical, sometimes frustrating, often sharp portrait of the global arms trade. Niccol's films like to examine the nature of reality, but with 'Lord of War,' he drops the allegory to poke around the existing world, and those who make it such a violent place.In the opening credits we follow a bullet from its birth to the death it ultimately causes (this bullet cam recalls, perhaps intentionally, the mischievous police siren from 'The Naked Gun' movies). We then meet Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage), a Ukranian immigrant who makes a similar journey through the last few decades of global conflict, going from small time gun dealer to the self-proclaimed biggest merchant of death on the planet. Yuri's justification of the immorality of his trade is to practice it entirely amorally, with zero regard for politics, consequences, or loyalties. He explains all this to us in a running voice-over that stretches the entire length of the film, emulating Scorcese's device in 'Goodfellas.' At one point Niccol even throws in a police helicopter to tail Yuri around New York, an unambiguous tip of the cap to the gangster epic that 'Lord of War' so fawningly emulates.The film spends considerable time on Yuri's family and personal life, and it's here that it has trouble shifting gears. Though there are some good scenes with Yuri's coke-addicted, deadbeat brother (Jared Leto), these family sequences end up repeating themselves, with Yuri tossing out vague, half-hearted defenses of his trade, though it's clear he doesn't think it requires any. The idea is that a family treated with the same ruthless detachment as the gun running business is destined to be yet one more casualty of that callousness, but 'Lord of War' gets torn between being a character study and a larger commentary on contemporary geopolitical realities. The film is at its best when following Yuri at work, and his efforts to stay one step ahead of dogged INTERPOL agent Jack Valentino (Ethan Hawke). There's a great, absurdly nihilistic scene in which Yuri, forced by INTERPOL to land a carrier full of guns on a dusty West African road, hops about on the deck, exhorting the locals to take all his cargo 'free of charge,' then watches over the next several hours as they also take away the plane itself, piece by valuable piece.Nicholas Cage is just right for this material; his matter-of-fact drawl is perfect for explaining why an arms dealer is less dangerous than a car salesman. 'Lord of War' feels like it has more it could say, though, were it less divided between its personal and professional stories. How can we condemn Yuri, it asks, without condemning the society and politics that produce and depend upon him? It's a shame that this film settles for being intriguing and engaging, when more was within its grasp.",8,0,3,1 October 2005
Munich," Spielberg on a roll
","At first, Avner (Eric Bana) has few hesitations about his mission. Never mind that his wife is seven months pregnant; the men who killed 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics are animals. They respect no laws. Now is the time for Israel to show the world its strength, and Avner is honored to serve his country. Meeting his team members, he exchanges pleasantries. One is a doll-maker. The men marvel at Avner's cooking. The camaraderie is more appropriate to a fishing or hunting trip which, in a sense, it is.Steven Spielberg's 'Munich' is neither a paean to the Great Sacrifices required by war, nor a testament to the human spirit. Brilliant as they were in their own ways, neither 'Saving Private Ryan' nor 'Schindler's List,' his recent political movies, share the ruthless detachment that 'Munich' demonstrates toward its subject matter. It's hard to argue against the savage brutality of the Munich assassinations, and it's no surprise, really, that Avner and his team relish their task of locating the architects of the raid. When they find their first target, on his way home with his groceries, the banality of the situation gives them only momentary pause. Maybe they were expecting to interrupt a wild-eyed Palestinian in the act of eating a Jewish baby, but what they find is a regular person doing errands. He's an animal, though, and must be liquidated. The same goes for the target whose little girl answers the exploding telephone before him, and for the PLO's KGB contact, who makes pleasant small talk with Avner on a hotel balcony before being incinerated in his bed. Yet Avner can't confidently say that the Arab world is awed by Israel's show of force, particularly when letter bombs start showing up at Israeli embassies across the world, and when his source provides him with a fresh target who turns out to be the successor to a man he's just killed. These people are replaced faster than they can be erased. The letter bombs are a PLO response to the assassinations, which are a response to Munich, which was a response to Spielberg takes no sides here, impressive for a director with a tendency to wear his heart on his sleeve, particularly when it comes to portraits of his own heritage. 'Munich' in fact seems less interested in the particular politics of the Arab-Jewish conflict than with the cyclical dynamics that propel people to fight savagery with savagery. Spielberg presents figures so fixated on breaking one another's will that they're blinded to the long view. Perhaps it's when his compatriot congratulates him on a successful hit and the birth of his daughter in the same breath that Avner begins to reconsider the wisdom of his course, or maybe it's when he realizes that the same source that finds him his targets could just as easily find him FOR his targets. As he ultimately says to his Mossad contact, though, 'there's no peace at the end of this.' Spielberg has reasserted himself in recent years with some of the leanest, most focused films of his career. With two hard-edged and one half-brilliant sci-fi pictures ('Minority Report,' 'War of the Worlds,' and 'A.I.,' respectively), a coming of age story that managed to avoid pathos ('Catch Me If You Can'), and now 'Munich,' I'm reminded why the guy is the biggest filmmaker in the history of the world. 'Munich' is sophisticated and remarkably restrained by Spielberg standards. It doesn't profess to have The Solution to Middle East turmoil, or any number of other like conflicts, but it lays bare the folly of the strategies by which they have thus far been characterized.",9,0,1,25 January 2006
Cinderella Man," Non-formulaic formula
","'Cinderella Man' immediately corners itself with its name alone. Why give 2 plus hours of your life to a movie that telegraphs its intentions in the very title? Yet Ron Howard's film seems to relish the challenge of giving heft to a story that doggedly follows formula; the title could describe the film itself as well as the story it tells.Russell Crowe gives a performance of quiet intensity as Depression-era boxer Jim Braddock. It's good to see Crowe channeling his penchant for fisticuffs toward the screen for once, and it pays off in his restrained, yet fully realized, portrayal of a man trying to keep his family afloat while seemingly everyone sinks around him. Well, not everyone. Braddock is fortunate to have connections among wealthy boxing promoters, who keep him fighting until a broken hand leads to his decommission, and destitution. He can't fight, and the dock bosses aren't likely to pick a gimp for a day's work. Already having promised his worried son that he'll never send him away, Braddock's situation soon looks as hopeless as nearly everyone else's. There's a powerful scene of him showing up to his former promoters, hat literally in hand, pleading for a few bucks to keep the lights on at home.But this being a comeback story, we know 'the Bulldog' Braddock will be back in the ring, jabbing his way toward improbable glory. It's no surprise, then, when he surprisingly knocks out a heavyweight contender for whom he was supposed to be a tune up. Nor do we expect a seemingly debilitating rib injury to stand too much in the way of Braddock's victory march. As for his final title fight, could it go any shorter than a full 15 rounds, or feature anything less than a seemingly invincible opponent with a habit of leaving corpses in the ring? If you're unsure of any of this, kindly refer back to the title.Howard is smart with this stuff, though, and keeps pugilistic matters mostly in the background. There's no waxing poetic about the purity of boxing; no paeans to the sweetness of its science. Braddock doesn't even seem to enjoy his profession much more than he would a round of darts with the boys at the pub. It's a job when few are available, a chance to keep his family fed and sheltered when no other options are open. Crowe's Braddock tries hard to keep cool in the worst of adversity; he doesn't rise to the provocations of title-holder Max Baer at a pre-fight banquet, and calmly understands his wife's near-hysteria at the prospect of widowhood. Things are tough enough without flying off the handle. Paul Giamatti, always fun to watch, does a nice turn as Braddock's sincere manager who sells all he has to finance his man's training. It's great to see Hollywood taking notice of Giamatti, who seems to inhabit fully all of his roles in spite of his untraditional profile.By openly copping to a by-the-numbers underdog story, 'Cinderella Man' frees itself up to focus on the much more interesting hardscrabble lives of its characters outside the ring. This film deftly reminds us that formula doesn't have to be formulaic.",7,0,0,18 July 2005
The Island," Michael Bay tries to act like there's more to life than wreckage
","Watching 'The Island' is like observing someone trying to pick up a pin while wearing hockey gloves. Director Michael Bay, specialist in Shiny Things That Blow Up, here unexpectedly finds himself dealing with an idea, and an opportunity to make a film that isn't hateful ('Bad Boys II'), boring ('Armageddon'), or, well...'Pearl Harbor.' He partially pulls it off, which is a compliment. Although it's not saying much, this is Bay's best film to date. Perhaps it's just his miserable track record, but I found myself rooting for 'The Island' in spite of myself.Everything about this movie, down to the marketing, screams 'house of cards in a hurricane.' 'The Island''s ad campaigns have clumsily spoiled what could have been a passable surprise, namely that the dystopic colony of the film's first half, populated by track suit-clad, metabolically-monitored drones is actually a clone farm for the very rich and very ill. When replacement parts are needed by their 'sponsors,' subjects are cast as lottery winners, to be whisked off to an imaginary island paradise, supposedly Earth's last refuge from a mass contamination, also imaginary, that these 'survivors' are told led to their arrival. This is a good set up that could go in a number of directions, but Bay seems impatient with having to spend so much time on sequences that operate at less than 100 MPH. While intriguing, 'The Island''s first half feels rushed and sloppy. It's amazing to see, in a colony where even urine is analyzed as it hits the commode, the ease with which its inhabitants are able to hatch secret plans, wander into off-limits area, and hoodwink security systems.Like a little boy squirming as mom wipes his face after dinner, Bay finally gets to go outside, and seems much surer of himself on the more familiar ground of jet motorcycles, giant dumbbells wrecking expensive cars at high speed, and chases among flying trains. The film is from here out thoroughly in combustion mode, and is as entertaining as such stuff can be, though annoyingly strobe-edited as in previous Bay apocalypsi.There's interesting material in 'The Island,' from notions of corporate bioethics to the human survival instinct to the nature of existence, themes that could be probed with a subtler and less hyperactive hand. Some of the great earlier Schwarzenegger films have delved into this material, and it's a measure of Bay's temperament to note that those films seem to be intimate character studies in comparison. As usual, Bay is most interested in fast-moving objects meeting fiery endings, but with 'The Island,' he at least tips his cap to something more challenging. I suppose that's a start.",5,1,2,6 August 2005
