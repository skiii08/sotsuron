Blade Runner 2049," Dull
",Never has a film looked so good only to have very little actually happen on screen. A definitive example of style over substance,6,2,4,6 August 2018
The Irishman," An absolute gem
","Yes the film is very long but it is an absolute pleasure to watch. The chance to see the powerhouses of De Niro, Pacino , Pesci , & Keitel directed by the master Scorsese for what will be probably the final time doesn't disappoint. The supporting cast too are fantastic",10,2,7,27 November 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Too many memories
","Can't remember the last time I thoroughly enjoyed a film this much. The performances are superb across the board. Yes the film does gloss over the darker side of Freddie, but what it does do is bring back fantastic memories of ' four misfits who don't belong together ' creating some of the greatest music ever.
The recreation of the iconic Live Aid performance is breathtaking in its accuracy.
Think I may have to return to the cinema again!",10,2,5,31 October 2018
