Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What I've been waiting for
","I am only 16, but I would have to say that I am a Star Wars freak.  None of my friends even like the movies, or have even seen them.  But they do not know what they are missing.The new movie was everything that I expected it to be, and more.  I knew the whole story of what really happened mostly from reading the books and seeing the original movie, but there were many things that surprised me that i thought were good.Anakin is a great character.  It is kinda disapointing since you know what is going to happen in the future.  I know that you know a little, but I love the fact of who the mother of Luke and Leia is.Jar Jar Binks was a great character.  It is hard to have a Star Wars movie without Han Solo, or some humorous character, and that is where Jar Jar Binks comes in.I love Obi-won Kinobi.  Ewan McGregor did a great job.  I love his accent!!! It is still very disapointing to know that he does not train Anakin as well as he should of.  But I wouldn't blame it all on Obi-Won, because Anakin has his own destiny.  I love Liam Neeson too.  He is my favorite actor in the world.I can't wait for the next prequels to come out.  I'll be in college, and I am going to get in the first showing of it.  I did not get in successfully at 12 because they didn't sell the tickets right!",Null,0,0,22 May 1999
