Moneyball," 2011's best American movie
","OK.im Greek.i don't know the first thing about baseball.only for what i 've seen in the movies.i get sports TV channels ,so i could watch but i don't like the game.seems boring.i don't see the romance.and i love sports.almost all of them..having said that,let me say to those who wonder,THIS IS NOT only A MOVIE ABOUT BASEBALL fans.this is a great movie.about lost chances ,about lack of communication and what it costs to people and sports.about the wrong way of looking curtain things.and about starting over.finding new motivations,trying to make a difference in a different way.the acting is superb!!!!!!brat pitt deserves an academy award for his low key all inside himself soulful performance.he truly emerged to be quite an extraordinary talent.about jonah hill..i already have stated,i think he is the next dustin Hoffman,and i hate comparisons,but i think this is a great compliment and also a true one.the direction is smooth,quite,mature,but never boring.the soundtrack with its few peaceful,also mature,and a little sad notes,give the movie the exact atmosphere that the whole production is trying to give.an emotional really mature journey of a movie,one that we don't see AT ALL in the American industry.a great bravo for brad pitt for believing this project,and letting us get inside the moneyball world.one world of emotions,of cold hard truths,one world exactly the way life is.a winner all the way to the awards.",9,0,2,13 January 2012
Drive," excellent film noir
","anyone else really wants to believe that he made it in the end?perfect plot.the kind that makes you wish for a happy romantic ending,although you know that this movie is going the entirely different way.the masterful motion of the camera that follows ryan in this hypnotically relaxed character,the guy that seems he have seen one bad thing too many in his life,he does not how to react in a nice environment,and bad things follow him around like a curse.the hero with the angelic face and half-smile and kind voice,the guy you don't see him coming.one thing i do not understand.in the end ,it is shown in a way that wants you to think he knew he was going to get stubbed ,but did not care.like he wanted to die.why didn't he tried to make it ,take the family and the money and run away.OK that way probably the family is safer ,but then again you never know,once the mob starts investigating.her husband was one of the gang who stole from them so..it's not like she is completely safe that way.i don't know i don't completely buy the end.entirely engaging movie nonetheless.",9,0,0,28 December 2016
The Artist," magical
","well i was reluctant of seeing this movie although i knew the trio stars from the oss movies.with trio i mean the two stars jean and berenice and the director michel.i heard it was good but a silent AND black and white?..let me tell you from the very first seconds that you start watching it grabs you and actually after a couple of minutes that the movie has pulled you in its magic,you re glad it is without sound because it adds to the magic.it is basically a romance story,but has other themes playing on the side.themes like success does not last long,people or dogs..that are faithful no matter what,and maybe the biggest theme of them all possibly it explains the title of the movie also,that silent movies or silence in general has more power than anything,and the minute that sound comes in,or it can traslate this to dialogue,to people speaking with excuses ,lies,then the magic disappears.this has a very deep meaning that i do not wish to analyze in full but i think you got the general idea.all the cast is simply extraordinary.you have never seen a similar movie of this kind.well..maybe the old masterpieces with charles chaplin like 'modern times'.i have to say though that the director whether has thought about tit the way i did or not,had a brilliant idea that audiences think he has succeeded the impossible,making a silent movie so successful nowadays,and propably he did but one has to wonder if people are not used to watch images with music in our everyday entertainment life already.look at mtv videos or movies in general that you hear music in the background playing all the time through out the movie.yes..people today are more accustomed in the silent movie technique than they realise.having said that i still think this movie should not be missed by anyone.it is simply to good.the visual side of the movie is beautiful,the music is great,varying from romantic to tragic to funny back and forth.it is a movie watched from the heart.and to add one silly mistake i noticed.here comes the spoiler..after george is rescued and brought to peppy's house to get better we see him in pajamas and everything.we assume he stayed at least a day resting.but when he leaves the next day,for instance,his clothes are dirty.with the servants that we see in peppy's house,one would assume that they would have taken the clothes ,that got so dirty during the fire,and washed them.i think it is kind of a mistake.but this adds to the tragic when he wears these dirty clothes and goes back to his burned apartment.great great movie.don't be cynical and miss it.",9,0,2,15 February 2012
La La Land," it's like magic !!!!!
","it either lifts you up or it does not.either you leave the theater humming the 4 notes ( the next 7 just following) all the time or u don't.you either leave thinking why couldn't they try to save what they had,why didn't he propose to her right after the 'fateful' audition ?but in a way we know that their dream was first priority.and they both got theirs.so it's a happy end.or isn't it? well i'm a fan.i just watched it and i feel to call it close to a masterpiece.maybe tomorrow i may have another opinion.but then,now the movie has lifted me.tomorrow who knows.OK.logic now.the singing is not done by professional singers.the dancing also.it's a glee kind of thing maybe worse.there are two songs,especially one,that keeps repeating so it's not exactly a musical.well then what is it ? it's magic.it's the bunny on the hat kind of thing.you either loved the trick or you did not.i did.and either way of looking at it,it's sweet.it's a sweet romantic movie.that's a fact.now maybe some did not like the romance either.OK.but i would suggest ..go and see it.it's a journey.don't let others tell you about it.go and do it yourself.good luck !!!!",8,1,6,18 January 2017
Mystic River," spoiler.who really directed the ending?
","SPOILER ALERT a very good movie all the way through the 2 hours plus...until the killing of tom robbins's character.all he had to say was 'let me take you where i threw the child-molestor's body'.if he w a n t e d to die,then that was not made clear.after that, we don't see any confusion or grief  in sean penn's face when he hears they found the real murderers.the discussion with kevin bacon is so underplayed,like they do not really care or they are relieved the movie ended.what about arresting him?or okay if he doesn't  want to, what about bacon's partner laurence fishburne?he was the driving force trying to find the murderer and questioning bacon's priorities.what happened to him?he disappears leaving sean penn's character almost smiling at the end.where is the grief for killing his friend or for his daughter?and laura linney?i am sorry for what they did to you.such a talented actress.but who could pull it off, the monologue she gives at the end when we do not know anything about her character and what made her react like this.all the psychological journey we are experiencing through out the movie from a director who seems to value the human condition prepares us for a climax,a purge (of some kind at least).instead, we are left with an ending with full of questions and more important with a 'who cares' mentality that destroys the prior two hours.it could have been a great movie.will the dvd have an alternative ending?(not a 'good' one necessarily,but a better one).just joking.i am sorry for any grammar errors but english is not my first language.but movies are.",Null,195,226,27 February 2004
