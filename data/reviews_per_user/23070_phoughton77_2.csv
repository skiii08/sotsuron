The Devil's Advocate," Creative and innovative story of temptation using the lead character as the devil in the flesh
","Keanu Reeves is a defense attorney from Gainesville, FL who is recruited by a NY law firm whose head honcho just happens to be Satan. Striking concept - and a surprisingly striking story is what follows. This is a perfectly cast movie - even with Reeves. What isn't needed here is Reeve's 'southern' accent. He's from Florida. That doesn't mean he has to have an accent. Hell, most of the people who live in Florida are from NY anyway. Pacino is perfect as an intriguing man who has it all - along with a guiltless conscious. Who wouldn't want that? Lomax does, and if he doesn't right away, Milton will make sure he does by the end. Theron is superb as Lomax's wife who goes along for the ride due to her loyalty to her broodingly successful husband.What makes this movie work is subtle way in which John Milton is revealed as Satan, and just what in the world does he actually want Kevin Lomax for anyway? This movie would've worked just as well if the audience didn't know this fact going into the movie. It could've pulled off a 'Sixth Sense' if wanted to. Nevertheless, the film keeps the audience glued to the screen in anticipation of what's going to happen next. We see Lomax's world caving in around him, and the only one who is oblivious to that fact is him. It is believable because if any one of us put ourself in his position - a top notch young lawyer with an unblemished win/loss record on the verge of his career breaking wide open depending on the outcome of his current high profile case - his first under Milton's firm, we would all act the same way. We would all be oblivious to the same signs he continues to miss - his wife's crumbling sanity, his mother's warnings, his subconscious awareness that his clients are guilty as sin.In the end, this is a story that is told right. Sometimes our greatest villain isn't as obvious as the back of our hand.",7,0,1,7 March 2005
Constantine," Worthwhile trip to the cinema given the competition this time of year
","First of all, disregard any comments on this film that compare it the comic book Hellblazer. Honestly, I would be surprised if one typical movie goer out of every cinema this movie fills up has read the comic book, and much less is a die hard fan of it. Forget that the 'original' story takes place in London and all that crap. Those not familiar with the comic book are just fine with the fact that this story takes place in L.A. - and in the states. Secondly, I must use a disclaimer that I am a fan of Reeves. I think these roles are what he was born to do. Now, what worked in this film are the acting, direction, and visual effects. Those points alone are what places this movie head and shoulders above the typical PG-13 'horror movie' sewage that has been leaking into the theaters this month. Where this movie lacks is the script. We are thrust into the life of John Constantine with very little preparation or introduction. He is a fascinating character and it would've been cool to see how he grew into the person he is when this film begins. The story is also a little convoluted and has subplots that are not developed enough. The 'cool stuff' in the movie is done very well, but there isn't enough 'cool stuff' and there is a lot of downtime. Props to the crew for presenting a unique and 'wow'-inducing depiction of Hell. A better plot would've worked better, and you still could've had all the 'cool stuff.' Nevertheless, if you've seen all the Oscar contenders by now, then this is worthy of a checkout - much more than the silly teen horror flicks that dominate the theaters this time of year. Sequel? I'm up for it. But how about a prequel? It would work just as well.",Null,4,22,22 February 2005
