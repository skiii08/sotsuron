Requiem for a Dream," Basically a snuff film
","Have you ever wanted to be depressed? Have you ever wished you could erase memories of a book or film, because they are so horrible? Then watch this snuff film.There is only one reason that people rate this movie highly... they think that they are supposed to. It's one of those, 'ooooh, that was intense and controversial so it must have been good!?!?' films. The movie features three different stories, each involving - from the start - a drug addiction that is so extreme it is an impossible notion that this many positive reviews came from people to whom this story hit home. The drug addicts' lives go from bad, to worse, to worse... and then the movie ends. I am not averse to drug related movies that end in tragedy. I think that more movies should end without a 'happy' ending. This movie fails horribly not because of the disturbing images or the subject matter. It fails because it is simply horrific to be horrific. There is no real plot line. There is nothing to be learned from watching it, and most of it is so extreme that it just is not vaguely reminiscent of reality.For this film to be in the top 250 speaks to the stupidity of the American populace. If I'm not mistaken, it is rated more highly than trainspotting, a wonderful (disturbing) film about opiod addiction. Sensationalism and shock... that is what the mass of twits in the US demand. Not insightful analysis or engaging plotlines... they just want to be horrified. That makes it a great movie? No. It makes those people pathetically stupid.I am in the field of DDU services at a detox center... this movie is not worth seeing for any reason at all. If I could give it a negative star I would.CMR",1,3,9,6 July 2019
