Angels & Demons," too bad the name dumb and dumber is already taken
","There is a saying: You snooze, you lose. In this case, you snooze, you come out better because at least you get a nap and not a head ache. This is terrible. It isn't anti-Catholic. It is just dumb and apart from some nice shots of the Vatican, absolutely worthless. Tom Hanks was so cute and had so much going for him. Now all I want is for him to go away and find a movie that Ron Howard has absolutely, positively nothing whatsoever to do with. Save your money, your time and a few brain cells. This one is a stinker. Of course it does have one very obvious virtue, everything that anyone associated with it does in the future will look a whole lot better by comparison. Anything would be better. A test signal would be better.",1,19,49,17 May 2009
Marie Antoinette," Wasted Effort and Time
","People may not like hearing it but this movie evidences that but for her last name and connections, the director of this mess would be hard-pressed to get paid employment as a grade school teacher. This is what used to be called a 'hot mess' and it does no one any favors. The playing with time and music could have been interesting but ends up being distracting. The acting is wooden and it seems uniformly so and it appears likely to have been the intention of the director. The whole effect is a bit nightmarish (eyes wide something or other?) but whatever was intended,what one should do is get the Norma Shearer version (not perfect history but a fine film) and say 10 times -- nepotism is a bad idea in film-making just as it tends to be everywhere else.",3,2,2,12 June 2011
Children of Men," Can you vote -0-?
","How many ways can one say awful? I could fill up ten lines with just that word and its synonyms but that would be too easy even if entirely accurate. First of all, it wastes the book from which it took its name and premise. Second of all, it wastes the viewers' time (to say nothing of the time of all concerned in its creation). The human race has its issues but, as presented here, its utter extinction would be an improvement. Dreck with a capital 'D'. Terrible with a capital 'T'. Stupid with a capital 'S'. Well, I hope you get the idea that this may just be one of the all time worst movies ever made. Cringeworthy with a capital 'C'. Is that ten lines? Hope so because it isn't worth any more time to review, watch or think about.",1,13,22,6 January 2008
Inside Man," dumb to the nth degree
","Given the word/line minimum, I need to be a bit creative in describing this utter waste of time. How about: worthless, stupid, dumb, pointless, silly, convoluted, wasteful, mindless, stupifying, clueless, beyond boring, ignorant, implausible, corrupt, sophomoric. Not enough? Too few lines? How about an exercise in drivel that makes one question whether Hollywood deserves to survive the next California earthquake. By the way, if one wants to find something redeeming about this mess, my take is that the banker is a stand-in for Soros. That said, given the normal lifespan allotted to us, don't think the bad guy would look so good at 90. Bah, humbug.",2,3,7,15 March 2008
Sherlock Holmes," miscast mistake
","For starters, the two stars should have switched roles. Jude Law could have pulled off a Sherlock Holmes that one would have wanted to see in this movie and even in some sequels. Plus, Downey could have done Watson as a rumpled genius who gave more support than is generally known. Then, to actually have made the whole thing work, a different director, one who hasn't been marinating in the sexually confused alternate universe of Mr.Madonna, could have made a buddy movie for this age that revealed a mind meld without bedroom influences. Gee, where is Alfred Hitchcock when you need him? He knew when and how gay inferences should be used to season rather than poison a franchise-worthy film.",1,27,61,25 December 2009
