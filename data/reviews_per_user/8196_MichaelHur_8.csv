The Blair Witch Project," Different and so typical at the same time
","first 'horror' movie i've seen with out any unneeded music.The Blair witch project, it suspects me to be scared without even trying, it's not that easy. You really have to be awake the first 15 minutes of the film or you won't realize what your'e supposed to be scared off. The film tries to invent a revolutionary kind of method, which is to not have any music to try and scare the audience. Is that method good? Personally I don not like that. It collapses on it self trying to be a horror genre. There's nothing horrifying about it.Let's say that The Blair Witch Project is real and you find the video cameras, you must then wonder why they didn't stop recording while they were fighting. It's just not realistic",5,1,2,1 March 2015
This Is the End," Best comedy movie of 2013
","The cast of the movie is epic and they know each other, which can be a vital part in the production. The plot is simple the world is ending and two best friends are stuck at Francos house. The acting is good, but a little relaxed and calm. The film has it low and high points, but is usually very exiting. Every actor plays as themselves, and i think thats just awesome, it brings the character more together. The writing is just casual but no comedy movie is a 10 out of 10. Sound effects are both really good or just awful. I feel like Emma W didn't do her part good enough, and she was just having fun. of course i believe the cast itself planned all long to have make it kinda joke.",8,1,4,26 February 2015
Cast Away," Wouldn't watch it again
","Tom Hanks has to be one of the best actors out there.I watched this movie because they made fun on it on Family Guy and I wanted to understand the joke. I felt like this movie relied on the beginning which was not to good... at all. The movie skipped time which left a gap in the plot and the realism of it. There was no standout acting performance. Well except Tom Hanks. I don't feel like this movie is what everybody is trying to make it, it is what it is.I felt no realism in it (i can't do an a example without spoiling anything). This movie was almost just like All is lost except this is actually decent.I'm going to recommend you too see this movie, cause it's an a have to watch film, it may not be good but it's an a have to watch",6,0,1,1 March 2015
American Psycho," A fun mood
","Everybody's a little Psycho.It's great movie and it couldn't have been better than it is. Christian Bale portrayed Bateman beautifully. The film told more then it actually showed, it kinda implied most of what you see. And you can easily see how brutal Bateman is, without the director showing the murders. The cast is great and Christan is the only stand-out in my opinion.I was not sure if I should give it a 8, but it's not good enough, then 7, It's not that bad. I decided to go with 7 cause I could not see it be with those masterpieces that i give 8,9 or 10.We get to know Patric really well in the beginning of the film(like we got to know Jordan Belfort in the beginning of The Wold Of Wall Street), he's a man who takes care of him self dose not care about other, his needs are always a priority. I want to see other film do that instead of doing unnecessary scenes just to learn a character likes this kind of flower.Overall it's a good movie there's nothing really special but there were memorable moments in it that all movie buffs should know. It's not a have to see, but i recommend this film to anyone who likes (moderate) bloody films.",7,0,0,2 March 2015
The Intouchables," most Overrated of all time ?
","Everybody said that this movie was awesome, so I gave it a shot.Iusually don't like France movies so I didn't expect a good movie, and I didn't get a good movie. The scenes escalated way to quickly. Why would the handicapped man want him to take care of him. The acting is either overacted or there is no act in the scenes. In short the acting is bad.The writing It's just off, awful, Scenes either contain Way to much information or no information at all, and that confused me a lot. It didn't feel realistic, I'm pretty sure no one would react like that in real life situation. My recommendation is not to watch this movie.",5,18,37,3 February 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Not that good
","'I can't wait to see this movie i mean over 5 Oscar awards it's gotta be good ' I thought to myself.Peopole saying this movie does not need a plot is just slap in the face sad. There was nothing special about the movie. I felt like all the character were same. The shots got annoying after a while. The acting. It isn't bad but it could be better. Especially the lobby boy, no really good facial expression from him. But enough about him, let's tear the rest of the film apart. The acting was a moon distance to witty and... yeahThe script. It was full of one liners bull***, don't get me wrong i like a good one liner just as much as the next guy, but to many in a row and you get sick of'em. Obviusly there was no 'real' plot tho there were a lot of sub-plotsThe set/locations. I'm going to admit it was really beautiful, and the hotel it self locked amazing. And the uniforms WOWWW they locked really good one of the best part of the film.It's a movie to watch, only to say that you have watch'd said movie.",6,1,4,27 February 2015
Looper," Not for logical folks
","Self-sacrifice is not worth it.When i review a movie I think of it as it could actually happen( By the logic of the universe that the movie is happening in) and time travel, no thank you, by no means could actually be real. There was nothing special about it, no outstanding performance or nothing.The casting. This movie had Bruce Willis and Joseph what ever his name is. But they didn't even do that well, I expected more from them.The locations/shots. There was no shots really outstanding or wallpaper worthy. I didn't even notice the locations, i guess the big field was the best (background?) location.",6,1,1,28 February 2015
Her," Sci-fi, drama and romance?
","This movie got me to think.Not a lot of movies get me to think about myself and the future, but thins one did. The story happens in the future where technology is amazing. 3D hologram games and movies, bots that you can chat with, phones that read your email out-loud for you, and yeah pretty much everything you'd imagine a bot could do.There are minor plot holes like, this guys job the bot probably would be able to know a person well enough to write a personal love letter, nothing to go crazy over. Otherwise i didn't notice anything major.I wouldn't say that there was any stand out acting, well except if you count Scarlett. Scarlett did a awesome job acting using only her voice and i understood every emotion she was feeling( as a bot if that makes any sense ). Well i kind liked the girl he went on a date with, she was just WOW.I'm not recommending this movie to anyone, cause personally i do not like romance nor drama.",7,0,2,6 March 2015
