Walk the Line," Well acted but I expected more...
","I was a late blooming Cash fan and did not fully appreciate his talents until his death. I was looking forward to seeing this movie, and both Juaqin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon have you believing without a doubt that they are Johnny Cash and June Carter. The mannerisms and their chemistry work well throughout the movie. And even a day later from watching the movie I still am amazed at their singing skills. They nailed it! Where I was slightly disappointed was in either the writer, director, and/or the cinematographer's ability to really capture a moment with heightened intensity or gravity. For example, there is a moment of desperation where Cash is at a bank to cash a check, but there is not a feeling of desperation to the viewer at that moment. I compare this to a similar scene in Cinderella Man when Russell Crowe is requesting government relief and the viewer feels the impact there. It was never effectively communicated why essential elements occurred. What pivotal moment led him into the drugs? There were enough scenes to depict a problem but you never see it evolve. Did June have the same feelings as Cash for marriage? The movie implies she gave in to the proposal to some respect. There should have been an intimate scene between June and a secondary character to affirm her feelings. I guess the movie just has a feeling of going on a nice ride, but it never ratchets the emotional content from one scene to another. And while fiction, it would have been good to see a moment where the 'passing of the heart baton' occurs between his first wife and June. Maybe fictional, but it was effective in Sound of Music. I suspect that the creation team was trying to adhere to fact as much as possible per the family's advisory and may have been limited in taking some license in the story. It is an enjoyable movie regardless, and as much as a Cash fan as I am, I cannot see this winning Movie of the Year. With that all said, I hope they consider a 'sequel' to cover the remainder of their lives together. There is plenty of material, from the television shows, events in Jamaica, the Highwaymen, the lifetime achievement award in country music, the detachment from the industry, the efforts with Ruben, and then the final days together. This would be a totally different movie, but the actors would be perfect to carry on the line...",7,1,2,4 March 2006
Crash," Such A Fine Line Between Oscar and Lifetime Channel Movie...
","While this film was well done, I am stunned at both the average voter rating on IMDb and it earning the Best Film for 2005. This is a 'tidy' account of racial conditions in the USA, but no more cutting edge than the content found in any 'All In The Family' sitcom from the 70s. There is little character development, with each being one-dimensional regarding their personal discriminations. If this film is supposed to deliver a message, it was lost in my viewing. It appeared that every character's racial subjectivity was influenced and primarily based on the most recent event with that race. In my opinion, racial conditions have improved and evolved in our country further than this film suggests. Personal discriminations in the film are not subtle and are stereotypical to a fault. It was void of subtleties and wit that truly represent an individual's approach and reaction in real life. Comparing this to the other nominees this year, I wonder what criteria the voters based their vote upon to select Crash as the winner. This would be a 'surf-through' movie if you passed over it on the Lifetime Channel (only A-list cameo appearances save it from this deserved placement). This is a 'one-watch' movie and will likely date itself quickly. I am sure the idea for the film came out of a graduate student's thesis and would work well in stage form with an ethnic cross-section of serious undergraduate drama majors.",6,108,201,19 March 2006
Major League," Perfect Baseball Comedy - Multiple Watch Worthy
","If Troma, the Farrelly brothers, and Mel Brooks ever conspired to produce a movie with baseball as a centerpiece, it probably would end up looking a lot like Major League. The film benefits from excellent casting, clever writing that leverages these characters, and being able to take itself lightly. Take a look at the 'goofs' section and you'll see that it is riddled with issues! If anything, it means the audience is attentive enough to pay that close attention and probably by viewing the movie on multiple occasions. I think it adds to the movie's comedic angle, albeit accidental, to see the stadium clock set at 10:40 am during a game! Great elements exist throughout. The lowly Indians of the 80s taking on the Yankees, their bitter rival that also serve as the unlikable bully. There is the wild rookie, the veteran player's last chance, the love triangles, the loathed owner, and Bob Euker! This is one of those films that has moments that burn into memory. Fortunately, when it ends up on a cable channel, I'll stick with it because there is always a good moment ahead. Note: This review does not apply to the sequel! It confirmed the law of diminishing returns. 'II' is the dreadful counterbalance to the original.",8,0,1,24 June 2006
War of the Worlds," Puts the fiction back in science fiction...
","For entertainment value, I guess this has some endearing qualities as my wife and I were able to exchange comments throughout the movie about its absurdity. Considering the caliber of Spielberg, you would expect higher expectations and somewhat of a tenable premise. Tom Cruise, who could have easily surrendered this role to Ben Afleck, Carl Lewis, or a tomato can, somehow is able to overcome challenges that no one else on the planet is able to accomplish. He is the only person able to have a working civilian vehicle, to slice a monster's tentacle, and to blow up a 'tripod' that the entire US military forces are unable to defeat. There is a reason that War of the Worlds was perfect for radio. Even in this case it is best treated as theater of the mind. The special effects are excellent and carry through well in surround sound, but that still is not enough to dedicate 2 hours of your life for.",4,2,3,26 February 2006
