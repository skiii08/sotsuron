The Longest Yard," Good fun !
","I guess that like many people, I was worried about how this version of the film would compare against the original. Especially with Adam Sandler playing the lead.I think they did a really good job. They concentrated a little more on the comedy and the film lost some of its darkness, but it was a lot of fun. They didn't mess around with the story much and that made it a little weird (knowing what was coming next), but in some ways it was like meeting an old friend again.Both the recent British version (Mean Machine) and this film were worthy remakes. Watch them both !",7,2,3,8 November 2005
