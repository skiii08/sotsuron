Ford v Ferrari," Predictable script and Go USA
","Nothing really surprising or deep here, by the numbers script, showing the all-american cliches: manly American men, each more charismatic and talented than a hundred Italian men, their loving and hot American housewives, great professionals at wonderful Ford, etc. You know: USA Is No. 1. Yaaawn.",6,89,261,19 October 2019
The King's Speech," not worth the praise
","I really do not get the Hollywood's weakness for everything royal and British. It is enough for a British actor to play an English queen or king to get nominated, it seems. For example Helena Bonham getting nominated here is just ridiculous, she is good of course but nothing deserving an Oscar nomination. The film is well made and acted, but is basically a lie, sentimental and simplistic one at that. King Edward VIII, the older brother here, was a known supporter of Hitler but the film does not mention it here. King George's speech impediment was not really so important, because the king's role was pretty limited at the time and his importance was little compared to prime minister's Churchill in preparing the country for war. Big deal that he was stuttering, he could have been mute and it still would not have changed much! The film also conveniently ignores that king George was NOT Churchill's supporter and thought his politics of clearly opposing Hitler was incorrect, instead he showed strong support for Neville Chamberlain's politics of appeasement, even after Chamberlain had cynically approved in Munich Hitler's invasion of Czechoslovakia! If it were up to king George, Churchill would not have been appointed PM, Halifax would have. And Halifax was just another Chamberlain. So the film is a sentimental lie for naive, sentimental public.",4,89,169,1 February 2011
Inglourious Basterds," not so good
","I had huge expectations for this film. Read plenty of great reviews and was preparing for a brilliant cinematic feast. Unfortunately, it was not to be. For a film that takes itself apparently 'tongue in cheek' not enough humor, not enough action, not enough character development. Not enough violence even, it came sparsely every 20 minutes or so. Not enough fun, in general. Must say that the entire cinema was disappointed, people left in silence, without any enthusiasm or clapping. Too much talking, which is not a brilliant as they say, simply talking. Some developments are ridiculously stupid, too much even for such a far-fetched premise: the risky, aggressive behaviour of the English spy in the bar, the fact that a common soldier in a bar speaks fluent English, the fact they manage to lock down the entire theater - with the cream of Nazi German machine in it - without anyone outside noticing it, or a shrewd Nazi officer negotiating the terms of his surrender with English command... on the phone! If Germans were so stupid the war would have been over after 6 months, not 6 years. At least if the film were more funny, witty, but it weren't. Even the use of music was irritating (but for the Bowie's song). Sorry, but a disappointment for me.",6,8,16,5 October 2009
Iron Man 2," quite good
","I want to start by writing that a requirement here of minimum 10 lines is pretty ridiculous. It is often possible to write more in a few words than in 50 lines. As for the film, I found it pretty good, actually. A lot of funny lines, Downey Jr. is good, so is Johannsen, Jackson and the rest. Scarlett looks sexier than ever and her fighting sequence is VERY hot and well made. The action sequences are well made and not overdone, only the Monaco race was for me unnecessary and pretty stupid (even for a film like this): where was the race security and why didn't the organizers stop all the bolids immediately after the attack (so that the car driven by Favreau would not have to go among them, in the opposite direction)???? Nevermind, I like IM2 more than IM.",8,4,10,5 May 2010
The Secret in Their Eyes," superb, even great
","sdream-752-918991 - I do not want to offend you, so please s)) off with your embarrassingly stupid review. This is one great film, superbly written and superbly directed. One thing is to know nothing at all about Argentina and the tragic late 1970s in that country, another is not to understand spoken Argentinian Spanish (both are necessary to fully appreciate this film), but another is to be a true mo*on like you. I feel offended by your cr*p review and would not want to know you in real life. They say movies are an easy to access and understand art, but really, superficial cows like you indicate it is a rather different story.",10,4,7,4 June 2010
Terminator Salvation," awful script and poor direction
","Awful script and pretty poor, totally mediocre directing kill this one. McG, what a ridiculous name/nickname for a director, for anybody in fact who should not be mentally a teenager anymore. Sounds like 'Big Mac' and his films are equally nutritional. Keep this dude away from directing any decent script in the future, please. He cannot direct even the fight scenes properly, which is most surprising for a 'fast food' director. I could go on and on about the weaknesses, plot holes in the script and lack of character depth or development but what's the point, others here covered it pretty well already. I just want to add that C. Bale lacks necessary charisma and charm in this role and is mis-cast; in addition even the praised special effects and the landscape that is supposed to project post-apocalyptic California are pretty rubbish too, at times the movie seems to be made directly for TV. Rent it if u must but it is not worth the cinema ticket price.",3,4,8,2 August 2009
500 Days of Summer," charming and superbly intelligent
","This is one great little movie. It exceeded my expectations and I could feel that the entire room was moved and intrigued as well. It is superbly written, directed and acted. And the soundtrack is awesome too. It is not really a comedy at all. Very highly recommended, though I am not sure if with your partner - only if you are sure one of another!:) The Zoey Deschanel is one fascinating young actress, charming and one of a kind, with gorgeous eyes and sparkling intelligence. One little detail in the script that I found a tad too much was the fact the girl at the end is called Autumn. That was too unlikely and smacked of a too-cute-too be true finale. Besides, she is drop dead gorgeous and also into our hero, what are the odds of that in real life? But apart from that overly optimistic bit the script is excellent, fresh, witty, smart or even profound.",10,3,6,31 October 2009
Interstellar," ludicrous story and too sentimental
","I give it a 5 only because it is an overly sentimental at times, ludicrous in its storyline, bloated sci-fi attempt at landing the Nolans some Oscars. A manipulative almost-dross. Chris Nolan is simply too ambitious for his own good. The comparisons with Kubrick's 2001: Space Odyssey are demeaning to Kubrick, they are not in the same league as film directors. Kubrick pandered to the intellect and treated viewers with respect, Nolan panders to the American Film Academy and the box office, and treats viewers with disrespect. Kubrick was a film artist, Nolan is a film craftsman and a businessman, nothing more. Interstallar contains too much talking, too much exposition. One astronaut explains to another the basics of how black holes work, like to a little child and just moments before they are to enter one? Pleeease. And what's with this father-daughter love and bond, crazy and all? The crying and weeping, she breaks into a crying fit more than 20 years later (kid you not) at the thought that daddy might have deceived her?? The underlining thesis of the film is that 'love is the only thing (a 'thing'??) which overcomes time and space'. Corny and retarded, and very Hollywood. Emotional and family-oriented string-pulling is at the core of Hollywood filmmaking business, that's what makes them mega bucks, so they go on manipulating. Chris Nolan is either emotionally infantile or a manipulative hack, a film artist he is not. Basically the only element in the film that I liked very much was the music score, I found it very pleasing and strangely not overbearing, though there is a lot of it in almost every scene. Even the much-praised special effects and shots of the cosmos do not impress, for me there is not a single scene that gives a feeling of enormous vastness of space and how the Earth is but a tiny, little speck like a grain of sand on an ocean beach. I guess the film will be nominated at least for special effects and musical score, but it is certainly not a masterpiece.",5,8,16,11 November 2014
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," the best film of the series
","For me it is by far the best film of all HP films so far. Yates did a splendid job. So far I have only enjoyed 'The prisoner of Azkhaban' and bits a pieces of others, but this one is the first I like a lot from start to finish. It is much more mature than previous ones, just like the trio of heroes is getting more mature. There is no cheesy dialog or childish jokes or sub-plots, the violent bits are done well and the use of music is excellent - sparse, economic but very efficient. Yates is not afraid to have several slow moments without any music, and I liked it. The short story about 3 brothers is a surprising gem of animation in itself. And despite being grim and sad, the film contains quite a lot of delicate humor. The acting is good, especially from Helena Bonham-Carter, the girl playing Hermione and that old silent lady historian, who has a short, mute but very effective appearance.",9,1,2,22 November 2010
Avengers: Endgame," A moronic ending, fit for a moronic universe...
","I give it 3 stars for the huge effort, special effects and good acting. Overall it is a stupid film, bloated with self-importance and sentimentality, with poor pacing. Action scenes did not quite land with me, you know, superheroes throwing and punching stuff, who cares.",3,47,84,26 April 2019
Quantum of Solace," a quasi Bond a'la triple X
","What a band of clueless idiots wrote, directed and produced this film. Someone should have told them before that the general public is tired of this new fashion of quick editing, cutting the action scenes and fights to pieces so that the viewer sees... nothing. It is an awful film-making method, which spoilt greatly 'Gladiator' for me and then several other action films, including this one. Large chinks of the Decalogue are totally cliché and boring. To have such a product, such a budget and choose a talentless director and a mediocre script is very disappointing. I like the them song though, contrary to most I consider it one of the strongest Bond songs of all time. I hope to see more fun, joy of living dangerously and expensively and more sophistication in the next Bond. Finally, someone wrote here that Judy Dench is in fact always the same, I agree. She must be the most overrated actress ever.",5,18,25,13 November 2008
Gone Girl," good and thought provoking
","It is a well made and intelligent film for adults, bleak and pessimistic in its outlook on people, women in particular. Maybe it went too far in the depiction of a failed marriage and of two people who fail to live up to mutual expectations. There are countless marriages that do not work but usually people just divorce, they do not turn out to be cynical psychopaths, even if they hate each other. But then we would not have a best-selling book and a film. What I liked is that Fincher is not afraid to ask whether marriage is basically a trap for two people pressured by the society and religion to stay together at all costs. The film is rather mysogynistic, it dislikes people. The women come off as even worse than men, usually stronger and more manipulative. The only character which is pleasant and not dumb at the same time is the female detective. Her police partner is well meaning but dull and stupid, the lawyer played by Perry is smart but cynical. Nick's sister, played by the attractive Carrie Coon, would be nice if it weren't for the signs that she is in love with her brother (in a non-sisterly manner) and psychologically hung-up on him. The film also undermines the myth that a child is always a blessing for a marriage, here the child allows Amy to trap Nick in their unhappy and twisted marriage. The production values are high as in all Fincher films and Trent Reznor's music is excellent - minimalistic and not overbearing but always stressing the point.",8,3,9,28 October 2014
The Dark Knight," good but overrated
","I wanted to love this film. I hoped it would live up to the hype. I feel it does not. It is a solid film, ambitious and serious. Maybe too serious. Most of it are chaotic chases and fights or serious, somber talk about politics and commitment. Almost entire film is in the urban dark surroundings, literally dark, which is a lot to take in a very long movie. And too much Republican agenda for my liking, characters say it has to be worse before it gets better, u should endure a period of unpopularity, u stand for more important things than the public image, there are guys who do not follow logic, they just want to see the world burn, vigilantism is a price of freedom etc. One might think this Batman is, ehm, George W., Joker is Bin Laden and Gotham is America. Too much in a film about a guy in a plastic suit with two protruding ears who can fly, chasing a megalomaniac made up like a clown. A maniac that defies realism too, being able to be in many places at will, move around secretly tons of explosives etc. For a movie that takes itself that serious the transition of Dent into TwoFace is simplistic and shallow. Of course he fails to shoot the little blond boy because Batman intervenes at the last moment. It was a scene like from Peter Pan movie. And Batman has to beat Joker up to get the whereabouts of kidnapped Dent and his girlfriend but on two other occasions he knows where Dent is, just to intervene in time. For me the music was the only stand out, on its own keeping the adrenaline up.",7,7,13,21 July 2008
Avatar," beautiful but a tad infantile and predictable story
","Unfortunately Cameron looks down to the public and offers us a story so full of clichés and of a simplified view of the world, people and the Universe in general, that it is truly condescending. Neither he nor the studio behind him respect their audience. And after they sunk a reported 400 or so million in the project who can blame them? They need to recoup at least most of this money, and they do it by trying to appeal to as broad an audience as possible. I think Jim Schembri from The Age sums it up very well: 'There's no argument that, as a showcase for the immersive potential of 3D visual effects technology, James Cameron's sci-fi epic Avatar is an unqualified triumph. But as a story designed to engage, enthral and entertain adult audiences for almost three hours, it is a disappointment strewn with weak characters, environmental platitudes and anti-progress clichés. A compulsive envelope-pusher, Cameron invented a pioneering camera system and ground-breaking visual processing techniques for the film, but perhaps he should have spent a little less time obsessing over the technology and a tad more developing the story beyond the compendium of clichés it regrettably is.' My vote is 10 + 4/ 2 = 7.",7,17,41,16 December 2009
Zombieland," Superb fun/horror film
","I am not actually a fan of horror films. One reviewer called Zombieland less scary than 'Shaun' but I could not disagree more. I think the difference was much more violence and much more energetic directing of the action bits here than in 'Shaun'. In general there is some disturbingly brutal and visceral violence in Zombieland, whereas it was toned down in Shaun. That one was more a comedy in the midst of zombies, this one is much more a horror film with a lot of comedy. In short I find this one much scarier. Also funnier, which is because it is better written; i suspect if all the juicy 'f' words were taken out of 'Shaun' not much would be left. But nuff about Shaun. I think the opening credits - about 5 mins, are about the best I have seen and they already make it worth seeing Zombieland. Then the scene with the blond hottie turned zombie is also kick ass well directed and acted. The soundtrack is to crave for and I will definitely buy it. Emma Stone is amazing - a good actress and very hot in an interesting way. And the best of all - BM cameo, an absolute gem! I had a very good time thank you.",10,1,2,11 January 2010
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," awful
","I think it is a horrible movie. It is like a Bruckheimer movie mocking itself, his style is degenerated here, it is chaotic, overdone, messy, senseless, witless, stupid to the extreme. One of the worst directed and scripted movies ever and probably the worst Bruckheimer movie so far. And those nasty, sleazy allusions to the sexiness of Megan Fox, as if she were a sex toy and not an actress. LeBouf seems to do the same role again and again, and with his lack of good looks (or rather his ridiculous looks) I suspect his 15 minutes at the box office is to be soon over. I simply do not see what is interesting or talented in this guy, his looks are none and his acting range seems limited. I was not too hot on the 1st Transformers film but it had some redeeming qualities, yet this one is much worse.",1,12,27,30 June 2009
Joker," Very good film
","This film almost lives up to its hype. Very good, but 'one of the best films ever' ? No. What I liked best about it is the score. Excellent, creepy and melodic. What I liked the least is the idea that he would start a violent urban movement of people rioting in clown masks just by shooting three Wall street brokers in metro. It wasn't even clear to the public what the motive of the shooter was. I also don't understand why he killed the shrink woman in the asylum. As for the Phoenix's performance, it's very good but not as amazing as many reviewers say. Overall, a very good film but not an amazing masterpiece.",8,1,7,4 October 2019
Joker," A welcome tribute to the 1970s filmmaking, with a twist
","I like it. It's a serious film for adult audience which does not offend its intelligence. As if made in the 70s, the golden era of intelligent Hollywood filmmaking. The cinematography, the acting and the musical score are all excellent. For me, what makes the film more intriguing is the possibility that it plays a trick on the viewer. It seems to be constructed similarly to Nolan's Inception. In my opinion, almost the entire story is what Arthur F., a mental patient locked in an asylum, is retelling or remembering. Only the last minutes at the asylum we see in 'real' time. Thus it's just a story imagined by a crazy person from New York in the early 1980s, who thinks he's Joker in Gotham City.",8,0,1,14 October 2019
Inception," the entire film is Cobb's dream
","An amazing thing happened to me with this film. Never before have my views on a film shifted so dramatically as with Inception. In fact it is my second review of it, I edited the first which was very unflattering. What happened? Well, by chance I read an eye-opening analysis at chud.com, and then I went to see it again, this time in IMAX and with better sound. Chud's piece on this is quite brilliant and profound. I also shows that sometimes it is not enough to see a film, especially such an ambitious one, it is important to read about it, for example what the director says about it. Chud explains that in an interview Nolan reveals this is kind of autobiographical film for him, in a metaphysical sense. It is about... making films, about creative process! Yes yes, not about Matrix so much. DiCaprio confirms it, he says it is much more like '8 and a 1/2' was for Fellini than it is another Matrix. Cobb's team is like a film crew: a director (Cobb), producer (Saito), screenwriter (Ariadne), actor/ actors (Eammes, Fisher). And then there's Mal: a director's or artist's fetish or obsession, something that an original artist usually tends to bring into his work, for better or worse. That is why some good directors should not write scripts, like Cobb, you see? Chud then explains that seen this way, the ENTIRE film is a dream, Cobb's dream. We cannot be even sure that his wife is dead in his 'real life', maybe she has just left him? The purpose of such a film for Nolan: analysis of why films work for us or not, why we identify with characters and feel for them or hate them, even if we know that what we r watching is unreal (a dream?). Chud brilliantly writes that some people can shed a tear or two during sad moments of the animated 'Up' (or Toy Story), which does not diminish their emotions and does not make them untrue, even though they r reacting to pure fantasy. I for one was deeply moved when the young Fisher discovers what's in the safe and has a catharsis. I was moved with him, and I think Nolan tried to show us that such is the worth of good art and performance. Plus he included in this film elements from melodrama, heist movies, Bond movies etc., all in one. He could not include much of a comedy because it is supposed to be a dream of a sad character, someone who has apparently lost his wife. And when we know the entire film is a dream, many of its apparent inconsistencies or unlikely events do not trouble anymore, because it is Cobb's subconscious we are watching. And if Nolan says Cobb is like him we can guess Cobb is a film director in 'real life', dreaming like a film making and about his wife that left him. Details start to make sense: bad goons cannot hit good characters - like in a dream or a bad action film, Cobb attaches the rope onto a chair in which Mal is seating though he has said he could not trust her, Mal is seating on a ledge opposite their hotel room and that room is like a copy of their room, the children look exactly the same and are dressed the same during the ending as before, the narrow alley moment in Mombasa, the explicit names like Ariadne (Greek mythology, the maze) or Mal (evil in French and Spanish), Ariadne asking Cobb what's in the snow castle FOR HIM when it was allegedly Fisher's dream... So I upgraded this film from weak 4 to a very strong 9 after that, for originality, ambition and high production values. Thanks to Chud, the film critic. I do not give it a perfect 10 because I still think the first hour is a bit flat and they talk too much in it.",9,4,7,25 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," very modern
","It is a Guy Ritchie movie through and through. Frankly he might diversify his directing techniques a bit. Having said that, I like his style and I liked the film. The acting is top notch, the music interesting (nothing 'English' about it...), two gorgeous women, fast tempo... What I disliked was too much editing of the fighting scenes, at times impossible to see who was doing what, but I guess it is a malaise of most young directors these days. The CGI-created London was a bit too dark and monotonous, and a bit artificial at times. Holmes's clothes were too 'bohemian' and out of touch I think, I know he was a rogue character, very eccentric and so, but still very British, no?? The way he dressed was more apt for... Tom Sawyer, too American. The bit about 're-conquering the colony across the Atlantic' was tad corny, Ritchie playing to the US audience too much here. What surprised me, and I have not seen any comments on it, is how Ritchie ridiculed the greatest myth of Christianity: that of Jesus' resurrection. The same was done in the French phenomenal costume drama 'The Brotherhood of the Wolves' a few years back, and also nobody seemed to notice it then, or maybe nobody cared. Well, I do not care either.",8,1,3,2 January 2010
Centurion," very gruesomely good
","Quite good actually. One should know what to expect from a film, I expected decent historical portrayal of how cruel and dangerous life could be in Britain near the year 100, what being a Roman soldier there was like, a bit about Picts being fearsome fighters, and some gory, untamed fighting scenes. I got all that, plus a convincing Kurylenko in a mute role... One should not expect a brilliant script in a film like this, sure there were minor complaints to be made: Kurylenko's character was supposedly an experienced warrior but she apparently had no clue how to attack a fort or a village defended by only 3 men..., Picts' leader's son is killed by Romans yet he sends only a handful of Picts after them with a woman in charge??.. Well, it seems to be headed for a sequel, with the hero living in a hut with the hot witch, she getting killed by the Picts and our hero on a revenge quest and all... or something like that. If they keep it that gruesome, bloody and realistic I do not mind if they make another 5 movies about this Roman centurion in Britain.",9,13,30,17 August 2010
Creed II," Must be a mistake
","Maybe i watched a different movie, because i cannot believe how good or even raving reviews this one is getting. I have found Creed II disappointing, with a simplistic and predictable script, full of cliches. At least the boxing and training parts should be good, but they weren't either. The boxing in this film seems more like street fighting, with boxers landing more clean punches within the first minute of the fight than Mayweather jr or even Tyson in his heyday could in entire 12 rounds. Completely unrealistic. And training for such an important fight in a desert? Please. The film doesnt say anything honest about the boxing business, we see here a successful US boxer living like a recluse, in a mediocre apartament, surrounded only by his one loyal aide and his wife, what about the usual entourage and swarm of people like masseurs, coaches, media assistants and publicists, financial advisers and groupies? What about the money and the financial motivations? Every top boxing fight is basically about earning millions of USD, in the real world. It is a simple film for the naive audience. OK if it was at least entertaining, but nope.",2,70,131,24 November 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," a mediocre film, for nostalgic fans and children
","The fact that this film has an 8,9 rating here and maintains a ridiculous 9,5 on another popular film-rating website shows that the critic community is corrupt. It's Disney, baby, not for nothing they have spent 4 bn on this franchise. What I have seen is a mediocre film, I have seen several much, much better sci-fi films, not to mention great films from other genres, which did not get such high ratings. This is a run-of-the-mill fare, typical of Abrams, who is a technically fluent craftsman but not a great director, not a film artist nor an auteur with artistic personality. A corporate hack, good at making movies to earn tons of money. He is another Michael Bay, though less talented, Bay at least has his own singular style and a certain cinematic swagger. I rate this a 3, and only for the sentimental value and for the overall effort. If great sci-fi films, like 2001: Space Odyssey, Bladerunner, Alien or Looper, deserve a rating of about 8 or higher, this simplistic and infantile story does not deserve more than a 3. If this gets a 9, Bladerunner deserves a 15, please. SW The Force has mediocre direction, infantile script, weak dialogues, mediocre acting, sterile action, mediocre photography and mediocre music. Shame on the film critics who rate it so high, I doubt their professional integrity.",3,61,121,19 December 2015
Da 5 Bloods," Mediocre and chaotic mess
","A disappointment. One of the weakest Spike Lee's films and one of the weakest films about the Vietnam war. The most interesting thing about it are the clues that the French also had their Vietnam war and there's some French history left behind there. I highly recommend the 2018 French film about the Vietnam War, titled To the Ends of the World, which is a far better film than Da 5 Bloods.",3,3,9,14 June 2020
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," disappointing
","Even compared with the previous two, which were rubbish, this one is disappointing. There were many young girls in the cinema watching it yet even they found reasons to giggle and snare at some stupidity and bloated-ness of the script and the entire premise. This is one stupid, ridiculous film which in addition takes itself seriously. The main actress is pretty attractive, but she does not act well, comes across as wooden. Her vampire partner is downright ridiculous and the wolf admirer is unintentionally funny too, sporting a naked torso for the girl audience even when snow is falling. The action scenes are unconvincingly mellow, the script is rubbish and soundtrack poor. I do not know what Dakota F. is doing here, her role is just a few lines recited standing, without acting skills necessary. How sad that this stupid and poor film-making takes the box office in a stride.",2,26,49,9 July 2010
Moon," very well made and acted... but I do not get it
","I give only 6, because for all its strengths (excellent acting, very good music, directing, special effects etc) I just do not see the point of this movie. Oh loneliness sucks? Hmm, I did not know that. A person alone for 3 years starts to talk to himself?? Wow. A father and a husband misses his family?? Revelation. The entire premise of the implanted memories of his (their) wife and child makes no sense, because they are... CLONES!!! Why would the sinister company behind, that sent Sam into space, even consider implanting memories about a fake family? I do not know, other than to give the film more emotional and psychological depth. But it is stupid nonetheless, because... they are CLONES!!!! The company could have made and programmed the clones not to talk to each other, for example, and to have NO memories whatsoever, other than the need and desire to work. If they can implant any memories, why not that of a cult of efficiency and necessity to do as much work as possible while asking as few questions as possible. But then there would be no film, u see. In addition, the new Sam's 'victory' at the end is very short-lived, as every clone is clearly designed to live exactly 3 years only. So for me the film is very well crafted, but pointless. Unless its point was to support the idea of human cloning. In this case it is very good.",6,5,15,9 May 2010
Slumdog Millionaire," spirituality defeats materialism
","Wow, that is some beast of a movie. I mean, it can be analysed and commented on from various points of view, there are a few layers in it, it is rich, whether structurally and technically, or story-wise. It is even difficult to describe it in a few words, a film depicting acts of violence, including against children, the extreme poverty and humiliation, yet leaving one with a good feeling at the end. A piece of real life melodrama without a hint of melodramatic cheap effects, a story told in a western modern way yet reaching for the Bollywood or soap-melodramas inspiration and their simple stories about basic human yearnings and feelings. A modern story which is Dickensian in scope and method. Not to mention the invigorating, flawless musical score, the direction and editing. The only moment I raised my eyebrows was when the brother of the main hero had the sudden change of heart and character which, I do not think, is likely in real life, but I guess they wanted to show how religion played a part in his spiritual being and also defend the film a bit in the eyes of the Muslim community. Nothing wrong with that, I guess. I also doubt that the feelings of 10-year olds can win the test of time, especially in harrowing circumstances. The main theme of the film for me is the duality of human existence: the material and the spiritual inner life, with Boyle showing himself to be an idealist, a romantic on the side of the spiritual, the film juxtaposing in a striking manner the stark, brutal poverty and humiliation on the one hand and the persisting purity of thought, feelings and actions of the main pair on the other. They suffered so much since early childhood, yet their love is pure and conquers all. I know, it sound corny, yet the marvel of this film is that it works just fine!",9,3,12,24 February 2009
