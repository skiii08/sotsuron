Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Very well done
","We just watched this movie, and except for the minor gore, it was an excellent story. Benjamin Walker deserved an award for his acting, as did the makeup department. He captured Lincoln like no other, and looked JUST LIKE HIM to boot. Kudos to the makeup folks bc they transformed Benjamin into Lincoln. I actually did a double take when I saw him. Disappointed that the American public doesnt, in general, like this sort of thing, but I thought it was great. Two thumbs up!",8,1,2,13 January 2019
