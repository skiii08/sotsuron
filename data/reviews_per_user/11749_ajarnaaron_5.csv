Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," The Weak Link
","Stranger Tides seemed tired. Johnny Depp seemed tired. The storyline seemed tired. Okay, you get the point. The movie as a stand alone may have got a slightly higher score from me, but it must be compared to its brilliant predecessors. In the end, Stranger Tides failed to carry on the swashbuckling enjoyment of the previous episodes.This movie seems to be made for profit only. Alright, all movies are made for profit, but I really got the feeling that they knew no matter what, this movie would make them money.The cast was good, but not excellent. For the first time, I felt the story was forced. A good movie, but not as good as what came before.",Null,2,2,22 August 2011
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Nearly Perfect
","I just sat down and watched Life of Brian again. It would have been maybe 15 years since I last saw it. It inspired me to write a review.This is what comedy is meant to be. Now, this is British comedy, so to be fair, an American audience may not appreciate the style of humour as much. The movie is broken up into short vignettes, yet maintains a fantastic sense of continuity.It is one of those rare movies that gets better every time you watch it. There is always something you did not notice before. The lines are hilarious.I can't think of a comedy that is better than this. I won't give it a 10 because no movie is perfect :)",Null,2,6,22 August 2011
Pan's Labyrinth," Truly Wonderful Film
","I had the pleasure of watching this the night after having to sit through the latest Hollywood blockbuster the evening before.Boy, this movie restored my faith in films. A film that really builds it's characters, has actors who really can act, and a story that is wondrous and chilling at the same time.All the way through the movie you are jolted from fantasy to the harshest realities and at the end you are given the choice as to what you believe. The movie keeps you guessing at the Fawn's motives all the way to the end and you are never sure what will happen next.A movie I recommend to everybody, especially those who have had enough of over-hyped flimsy story lines.",9,2,4,21 July 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Weakest link in the series
","This movie just didn't do anything for the series. The writing was lazy and you needed to take great leaps of logic to allow the story line to become acceptable.The characters really were treated poorly. No real depth was given, and they often seemed force into a certain role rather than look as if they naturally belonged to it.The end is guaranteed to annoy you. Normally after a Batman movie the audience is buzzing when it leave the theater. There was quite a subdued feel after this one. Nobody seemed terribly excited about the event.You will have to be a major Batman fan to get anything out of this one.All in all a rather boring,predictable, and disappointing film.",4,7,19,20 July 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Entertaining if not deep
","It got close, very close, to be a very good movie. In the end the power of this movie comes from the connection you make with Witwicky. Early on in the movie, Witwicky fulfills his role nicely. He carries the movie along and you feel his frustration. The action is slow, and the movie tries to give you a lot of information, but it did okay.The problem seemed to come when we really go to meet the autobots. I just could not garnish much excitement for the good guys. Okay, they are robots, but they did not give me any reason to care if they were blown away or not.The action heats up in the second half almost to the point of there being too much. Things are happening all over the place, and the battle rages on and on. In the end the movie came to a satisfactory end, though hardly a dramatic one. This movie did it's job, but far from excelled.",Null,0,3,22 August 2011
