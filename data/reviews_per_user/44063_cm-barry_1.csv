Scarface," One of Al Pacino's finest performances.
","Although many people believe that scarface is an overrated film that isn't all that good, I think that it does deserve the credit it get's. The film has a pretty basic storyline with no twists in the plot, It is a straight forward gangster film were a gangster fights his way to the top, earning lots of money and getting good stuff, Then loses it all because of drugs. But what makes this film is the acting brilliance of Al Pacino in his role as Tony Montanna. In scarface we see Pacino as a outspoken, sick minded individual which we do not see in Micheal Corleone in the Godfather. On the whole i think Scarface is a good watch but not an amazing film, but the performance by Al Pacino puts this gangster film up their with the best of them.",10,0,1,3 July 2007
