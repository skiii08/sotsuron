The Blair Witch Project," A Great Piece of Modern Cinema
","If you remember The Last Broadcast from way back, you'll remember it was about filmmakers who went into the woods searching for a witch. The Blair Witch Project has a similar story, yet it is 10x better and much more scarier. When you are watching The Blair Witch Project, it feels like you are there, and that is great cinema. I don't think anyone really realised how much effort went into the making of this terrific modern movie, but it definitely deserves praise.The Blair Witch Project is a film no one can miss, and even if you don't like it, I guarantee, it'll frighten the socks off you!Rating: 8",9,1,2,21 July 2000
Erin Brockovich," Amazing!
","I found Erin Brockovich to be one of the best, amazing and realistic films I have ever seen. Julia Roberts puts on the performance of a lifetime, and boy, does she shine! The film is full of effort, and it was written by the same person who wrote 28 Days, Susannah Grant, who really deserves an Oscar for such brilliant screenwriting. Steven Soderbergh also deserves praise for his effort in making this terrific and amazing film.Erin Brockovich is an awesome drama with alot of comedy and tragedy to keep you glued to the screen the whole time. Don't miss it!Rating: 10",Null,1,1,21 July 2000
Fight Club," Brilliant
","From the director of the 1995 masterpiece 'Se7en' comes a new thriller from acclaimed director David Fincher. His direction is great in both films, but this one stands out as one of the best films of 1999. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are plain awesome, their performances are brilliant. While Pitt and Norton impress, the screenwriter Jim Uhlus, also shows a lot of confidence in script-writing.In all areas, Fight Club excels beyond belief, and I highly recommend it.Rating: 10",10,0,1,21 July 2000
As Good as It Gets," I Loved It.
","The first time I saw As Good As It Gets I thought it was average. The second time I thought it was good, and better than before. The third time, which is most recent, I though it was excellent. I was so unbelievably blind to think it was average earlier, because this film is so great. Everything about it was likeable, the script, the cast, the music, the impressive direction, the cinematography and even the websites damn it!As Good As It Gets is a movie I recommend for everyone, it is one of the best films of 1997. I'll be seeing it for a 4th time extremely soon I imagine...Rating: 9",9,0,0,30 August 2000
Alien: Resurrection," Extremely Entertaining.
","Alien: Resurrection is definitely not as good as all the other Alien movies in the series, but it is an extremely entertaining and intriguing peice of sci-fi horror that will keep your eyes glued to the screen for a couple of hours. Sigourney Weaver is back as Ripley, and again she gives a bloody amazing performance, but you'll be impressed by Alien newcomer Winona Ryder, who plays Call.There are many shocks and suprises in Alien: Resurrection, and it is entertainment to the extreme. Don't miss out on this major fun movie!Rating: 8",Null,0,0,18 August 2000
Seven Years in Tibet," Unbelievably Underrated.
","I didn't think Seven Years in Tibet looked very good, what with the displeasing reviews and a largely un-known cast and all. And I don't think it was good at all. It was a great film. I can't see while people didn't like it! The performance from Brad Pitt was excellent, the photography was breathtakingly convincing, while the sets and costumes never failed to impress. I could hardly pick a bad bone out of this film.I highly recommend this good old-fashioned, highly entertaining flick for all movie-goers.Rating: 8",Null,1,2,30 August 2000
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," The Best Animated Picture of 1999!
","I am a really big fan of South Park the TV show, but I am an even bigger fan of the movie. It has an awesome script, a great cast and a lot of cool songs that will stick in your head forever. The unforgettable characters will have you laughing your head off, and you'll be suprised at how such a small TV show could become such a major motion picture event.South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut is easily the funniest movie I saw last year, and a cracking peice of animated cinema. I highly recommend you see it!Rating: 10",Null,0,0,21 July 2000
Blade," A Cool, Creative Flick.
","I must say, I expected Blade to be much better than it actually was, but it never failed to impress me. It was extremely entertaining and never annoying, and the story was well-written and interesting. Blade is definitely not one of those predictable adventure movies, it is a hip, cool, creative, imanginative and totally awesome fun vampire flick that will keep you entertained for the right, 2 hour length.Blade is seriously nowhere near a true vampire classic, but it is an intriguing modern flick for all those real vampire fans out there!Rating: 8",Null,0,1,18 August 2000
X-Men," A Superbly Entertaining Film!
","I wasn't very fimiliar with the comic, so I wasn't expecting to like X-Men as much as I did. But I really enjoyed this superbly entertaining film, it is one of the best movies I have seen in quite some time. The acting was very satisfying, New Zealander Anna Paquin in particular gave another sparkling performance. The writing and screenplay were very good, Bryan Singer put lots of effort into this film. But, mostly, it is the technical things that made this movie. The sound was amazingly convincing, the visual effects were stunning and the editing was very noticeable and put to perfection.Sure to be one of the best films of 2000, I highly recommend X-Men to all movie-goer's.Rating: 9",Null,0,0,2 September 2000
Sleepy Hollow," An Unforgettable Haunting Masterpiece.
","I wasn't really all that excited about seeing Sleepy Hollow, it didn't look that good. But I was stupid to say that it didn't look good, because this film is instantly a modern-day classic. It would also probably be in my top 5 films of all time. It is just so entertaining, engaging, enthralling and exciting that I couldn't resist it. I give all my praise to the people who worked on this film, particulary Johnny Depp, Tim Burton, Andrew Kevin Walker and Christina Ricci. In every area this film is absolutely perfect, the visual effects are stunning, the costumes are eye-opening, the sound is chilling and the editing is noticeably full of effort. 
Don't miss out on this outstanding, unforgettably haunting masterpiece.Rating: 10",10,0,0,1 September 2000
10 Things I Hate About You," Loved it!
","I really enjoyed 10 Things I Hate About You. The story had lots of good twists, and the acting was great. Julia Stiles shows promise, and Joseph Gordon Levitt played his part perfectly. And it is not only another 'dumb teen flick', but it is a bitingly sweet romantic comedy that all ages will enjoy, not just teens.If you haven't seen 10 Things I Hate About You, I recommend you do, because you are missing out on a whole lot of fun!Rating: 9",Null,1,1,29 July 2000
Notting Hill," A Fun Romantic Comedy with Good Performances.
","I was really looking forward to watching Notting Hill, and I really enjoyed it. Not since Little Voice have we seen such an impressive British comedy that really shines. Hugh Grant is very amusing, it is his best role ever, and Julia Roberts is a screen delight, her performance was also very impressive.Notting Hill is by no means an absolute masterpeice, but it is a fun romantic comedy with good performances and a great script. I highly recommend it.Rating: 9",Null,0,0,29 July 2000
American Pie," The Best Teen Comedy of 1999!
","I loved American Pie! Unlike any other teen flicks, it mixes sexual crude dialogue with lovely and touching romance. There are absolutely no faults at all, the cast was perfectly chosen and made me fall in love with half the gals in there, while the production and screenplay were done very well.American Pie is a cool, hip, funny, sexy, cute and amusing comedy that will make you laugh your head off, and see how much better teenybopper flicks can be. I highly recommend you see it if you want to laugh your head off!Rating: 10",9,0,0,21 July 2000
Armageddon," Hugely Entertaining.
","Armageddon is definitely not a flawless film, there are places in the movie where it could of been improved, but mostly it is just a fun, far-fetched and hugely entertaining movie that'll keep your eyes glued to the screen for its 2 hour running time. Liv Tyler is amazing, as is Ben Affleck, they are a truly lovely couple, both cast perfectly. Bruce Willis is good, but I can really picture someone else playing his part.Armageddon is a great piece of cinema that goes beyond 1998's earlier disaster film, Deep Impact.Rating: 8",8,0,2,19 August 2000
U-571," Pointless.....
","I was expecting a good old-fashioned action/war movie when I saw U-571, unfortunately the results weren't good. Although, in places U-571 is a highly entertaining film, it quickly falls short with a terrible script, awful acting, bad direction and an overly-long running time. The great cast which includes superstars Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton and Harvey Keitel even fail to make the film even better.All in all, U-571 is not a totally terrible film, it is bound to give you chills with the awesome sound and great effects, but it is definitely one I wouldn't rush out to see again.Rating: 6",Null,1,3,17 August 2000
The Shining," An Awesome Horror Classic.
","Kubrick does it again with this totally awesome classic horror flick. His direction is very impressive, and he always makes good movies so he earns all his success and more. Jack Nicholson is excellent as the successful man slowly going nuts, and Shelly DuVall is incredible as the scared yet helpless wife. The cinematography is also excellent, and the special effects are full of effort.Don't miss out on this extremely impressive classic!Rating: 8",Null,0,0,25 August 2000
American Beauty," Fantastic, Brilliant and Moving.
","American Beauty is easily the best film I saw in 1999. It is also the second best film I have ever seen in my life. Everything was perfect, the direction from Sam Mendes was outstanding and Alan Ball's script was too great for words to explain. But the performances really shine in this masterpeice, the two leads, Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening are breathtaking. But it is also the performances from the supporting cast, like Wes Bentley, Thora Birch, Mena Suvari and Chris Cooper that make the film so watchable.If you haven't seen American Beauty, you must see it now. And if you don't want to see it, get help. Preferably professional.Rating: 10",10,0,0,18 August 2000
Being John Malkovich," An Absolutely Brilliant, Unforgettable Film Experience.
","I had heard Being John Malkovich was very good before I saw it, and I seriously didn't expect it to be in My Year's top 10. But the film is so brilliant, full of effort and unforgettable it would be hard for anyone to dislike it. Charlie Kaufman's script was remarkable, it should have won over Alan Ball's American Beauty, and anyone could say that. Spike Jonze also put alot of effort into this movie, he is certain to be a big 21st century director. The acting is also excellent, Cameron Diaz and John Cusack have rarely been better, and Catherine Keener and John Malkovich are simply a joy to watch.If you haven't seen Being John Malkovich, you are really missing out on a clever, interesting and brilliant film, so I highly recommend you see it today! Anyone would say the same thing!Rating: 10",10,0,1,21 July 2000
Face_Off," Awesomely Impressive Entertainment.
","Face/Off would have to be one of the smartest, most engaging action movies ever made. It is by far one of the best ideas for an action movie ever, and the movie is truly as good as the idea. The script moves at a good pace, the peformances from Nicholas Cage, John Travolta and Joan Allen are all very good, while the direction, sound, editing, and effects are all excellent.Face/Off is awesomely impressive entertainment, I highly recommend everyone see it. It is, for once, an action movie that not only action fans will enjoy.Rating: 9",8,1,2,30 August 2000
The Exorcist," Brilliant - A Masterpiece.
","The Exorcist is easily one of the best classic horrors ever made. Everything about this film was excellent - the performances were simply fantastic, the writing was foul but realistic and absolutely awesome, and the direction from the now legendary crusty man William Friedken is probably one of the best directing efforts ever. The Exorcist is a standout brilliant film that suceeds, still 25 years later, to be a masterpiece. It is a truly haunting, chilling and unforgettable film experience that you must not miss out on.Rating: 9",Null,0,0,18 August 2000
Jerry Maguire," Lovely.
","Jerry Maguire was a totally awesome movie. Firstly, it is totally hilarious while at the same time sharing dramatic elements and realistic romances. Secondly, the effort was very noticable. Tom Cruise and Renne Zellweger were almost perfect, while Cuba Gooding Jr. really earned his Oscar, his performance was fantastic and outstanding. Yet, the acting is not the only place were the effort was really shown. The writing from Cameron Crowe was original and clever, and his directing skills are very promising for the next few years.Do yourself a favour, and dont miss out on this bitter-sweet romantic comedy. Rating: 9",Null,2,6,18 August 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Makes Up For The Original!
","I have absolutely no idea why I saw Mission: Impossible II. I hated the first movie, but I simply couldn't resist seeing this. And I'm glad I did! It was an entertaining movie with a good plot and great acting. Thandie Newton was absolutely gorgeous, her performance was excellent, while Tom Cruise showed effort in playing the main part and helping produce the film.
While Mission: Impossible II may not be a masterpeice, it certainly makes up for the original, and is a worthy watch. Your bound to enjoy it.Rating: 8",Null,0,0,29 July 2000
A Bug's Life," Well, It Sort of Grew On Me..
","The first time I saw A Bugs Life was at the cinema and I came out thinking the film was absolutely terrible. But, I have to say, since then I have seen some pretty impressive reviews so I thought I would give it another go. I have to admit, it sort of grew on me, I really liked the idea and the CGI's and Cinematography where excellent. But, sometimes this film is a little bit slow, typical and quite boring. A little while ago I would of given A Bugs Life 1 out of 10, so consider this rating quite generous.Rating: 6",Null,0,0,30 August 2000
The Hurricane," A Moving Film Experience.
","I was expecting The Hurricane to be a boring true story about some stupid boxer who got caught up with the law. Instead I found it to be a moving film experience, with excellent acting, a great director and a realistic script. I am very glad Denzel Washington won Best Actor at the Golden Globes, his performance was brilliant. Vicellous Reon Shannon also put on an impressive and almost unforgettable performance, and it is a shame he got no credit for it - from anyone.The Hurricane shows true effort, and I recommend everyone to see it, because, I promise you, you won't forget it.Rating: 9",Null,0,2,21 July 2000
A Clockwork Orange," An Outstanding Classic.
","A Clockwork Orange is easily one of Kubrick's best films, and it is probably one of the best films ever made. The reason this classic is so outstanding is because it excels beyond a limit in every area. The direction from Kubrick was excellent,  the acting was brutally honest, the script was unbelieveably good and the photography was lovely. Still, while this film is sometimes extremely hard to watch, we are still required to laugh at times, with the stand-out jokes from the script. I highly recommend you see this film, it is one of the few movies that matches up to its book. And the book was beyond brilliant.Rating: 9",Null,0,0,27 August 2000
Titanic," I Still Can't Stop Thinking About It.
","I am sick of people saying this is a bad film. Get used to it, this was a breathtaking journey, it deserved all its 11 Oscars and all its success. I am extremely surprised that it isn't in the IMDb Top 250.I liked everything about this movie, the performances from Kate Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio, Frances Fisher, Kathy Bates and Billy Zane were all impressive, but this time, the performances aren't the sparkle in the film. It is really the effort that went into the direction, visual effects, sound and sound editing and musical score that made the film such a sparkling, memorable gem.This is the best film of 1997 no doubt, and after which will soon be 4 years, I still can't stop thinking about this amazing achievement.Rating: 10",10,2,3,30 August 2000
Die Hard," Not Terrible, But Very Overrated.
","I was expecting Die Hard to be an excellent action movie when I rented it about a month ago. Unfortunately it is definitely not an excellent film. In places it can be annoying and slow, and it makes you want to go outside and do something else. But mostly, Die Hard is a hugely entertaining piece of work, worth seeing only the major action fans among us.I think Die Hard is definitely not a terrible film, but I'm not going to rush into seeing any more of the series.Rating: 7",Null,1,1,19 August 2000
Psycho," A Chilling Classic.
","The first time I saw Psycho, I watched the first 20 minutes and stopped the tape. I thought it was boring. But, alas, I rented it again a few weeks ago and I didn't like it. Didn't like it at all. I bloody loved it! Psycho is a freakin' masterpiece! It is easily Alfred Hitchcock's best film, and it is definitely an unforgettable chilling classic. Anthony Perkins was brilliant as Norman Bates, I will certainly look out for more of his work in the coming months. Janet Leigh was also very impressive, she was a real gem of Psycho.So, don't make the same mistake I did, watch this classic today, and I guarantee you'll never forget it. Rating: 10",10,21,38,18 August 2000
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Top 10 Quality.
","One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is simply a brilliant film. I am really glad it is on the IMDb Top 250 and it deserved all its Oscars. The performances were all incredible, especially from Jack Nicholson, Brad Dourif, Louise Fletcher and Danny DeVito. They all played their characters realistically and for all of them, this film is a career-best. While the acting was probably the best thing about the movie, there is definitely no doubt that the direction from Milos Forman was anything but brilliance, and the adapted script is moving, original and clever.One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is simply top 10 quality, groundbreaking stuff.Rating: 10",Null,0,1,30 August 2000
The Iron Giant," A Magical Animated Picture.
","When I went to see this, I thought, this movie is just going to be another Mulan, a crappy try-hard animated picture. But, I was wrong. The Iron Giant was a naturally joyful animated picture, in fact it is one of the best animated movies I saw last year. The voice-overs are well done, the direction and writing were good, while the cinematography, cgi's and intelligence of the movie really bring it together.The Iron Giant is an absolutely delightful picture that everyone will enjoy, and everyone should cherish.Rating: 10",Null,0,0,21 July 2000
Any Given Sunday," Another disappointment for 1999!
","I never really like American Football flicks, so I don't know why I saw this film. It looked great, but unfortunately it is yet another disappointment for 1999, because of the bad direction and overly-long running time it failed to impress. There are some great performances by Dennis Quaid and Jamie Foxx, but unfortunately the most important leads, Cameron Diaz and Al Pacino were not a joy to watch. Seeing them screaming for over 2 hours gave me a headache.Any Given Sunday was not quite as bad as you can imagine, but I definitely wouldn't rush in to seeing it again.Rating: 6",Null,0,0,21 July 2000
The Sixth Sense," A Brilliant, Incredible Masterpiece.
","I hadn't heard much about The Sixth Sense before I saw it, so I wasn't exactly expecting a great movie. But The Sixth Sense was beyond a great movie, it was a flippin' incredible one! Haley Joel Osment put on the best performance by a young actor I have ever seen, while Toni Colette and Bruce Willis were strong leading performers. And I truly love M. Night Shamalyn's script, the idea of a boy seeing ghosts is ingenious, and it is one of my favourite scripts of 1999. M. Night Shamalyn also put heaps of effort into directing this film, he shows much promise for the future.See this brilliant masterpiece NOW.Rating: 10",10,0,0,2 September 2000
The Matrix," One of the Best Science Fiction Films of the Century!
","The first time I saw The Matrix I was bored out of my life. But recently it was advertised on cable and I couldn't help having another look. I was absolutely breathtaken! I think this film has to be seen twice to be liked, because now I agree with those who say The Matrix is one of the best science fiction films of the century! It is smart, engaging, fun, action-packed and thrilling entertainment that impressed the living daylights out of me.The Matrix is a movie you just can't miss, so anyone who hasn't seen The Matrix, see it now!Rating: 9",9,0,0,29 July 2000
Gladiator," Absolutely Breathtaking
","Gladiator was one of the few films that was as good as I expected it to be. It was an entertaining, interesting, impressive and absolutely breathtaking drama that will burn in my memory. Russell Crowe is absolutely brilliant, his performances goes beyond The Insider and he is destined to be the next Kevin Spacey. Connie Neilsen is also very good, she makes for a great supporting actress. It is not only the acting that will take your breath away, the direction, sound, effects and editing are noticeable and should easily get a mention from the academy.I highly recommend Gladiator, it covers all fields with perfection,and it will entertain you as well as move you.Rating: 9",9,0,0,22 July 2000
