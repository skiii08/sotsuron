Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Too many kids have grown up
","As a devout fan of the whole Star Wars phenomenon, I become increasingly frustrated with comments on how this new Star Wars doesn't stand up to the originals.  For those who remember the originals, they were just as much filled with bad acting, poor dialogue, and flat characters.  The Star Wars movies are meant to be fun, nothing more.  and The Phantom Menace is just that.  Who can deny the excitement of the light-saber dueling, the thrill of the pod race, or the sheer beauty of the alien locations?  Too many people are expecting the saga's content to have matured along with them, but Lucas' heart is still where it was in 1977 (though perhaps notably more profit-oriented).",10,64,103,18 August 2001
