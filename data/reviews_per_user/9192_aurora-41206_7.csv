Requiem for a Dream," Amazing art, questionable story line
","The edits and cuts and portrayal of the addiction were raw and extremely well edited. However, there were a few plot holes, like:
1) how did they catch them and send them to prison?
2) the diet pill thing - like in what world would they just keep giving her pills? Just like that with no checks
3) her friends ignoring her descent into madness, even though she was shown to be sociable at the beginning
-> also, wtf was up with Tyrone and his mum?? Would've loved an explanation about why he kept thinking about her. What happened?The character development wasn't very extensive or believable.However, like I said, cinematography was wonderful, amazing cuts, and I still feel a naseous feeling at the pit of my stomach. And I want to say no to drugs. Always.",7,1,3,29 July 2019
500 Days of Summer," Good story, not my cup of tea
","I'm not particularly a fan of romance films which is why I rated it a 7; however, despite it being a romance film, I thought it was the exact opposite of cliche and expected. Normally you expect romance films to be amazingly romantic; everything works out, it's magical. But this gives you a very realistic depiction of modern relationships, and how not everything goes as you expect it to go.I enjoyed the ending, I thought it was well thought out. The expectation vs reality scene was amazing and almost made my boyfriend cry for the main character. He thought Summer was bad, which I guess it the main point of this story.I would recommend, think it's a film that should be watched at least once, but wouldn't rewatch.",7,0,0,24 July 2019
Shutter Island," Masterfully crafted
","It was an amazingly crafted film. The imagery and iconography was amazing. If I watch it over again, I am sure that all the scenes will be twice as impactful, and I will discover more new things about it.The only thing that I disliked was the ending because I felt it was a bit empty. I felt very sad for the main character, and didn't feel like any justice was dealt. But that's how the world can be sometimes.In summary - plot line and film technique intricate and amazing, but I finished it feeling some type of emptiness.",9,0,1,22 March 2020
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Interesting tale
","Interesting tale and humour, but not as deep or thought out as I expected it would be. Didn't enjoy the ending, or the beginning. Light hearted comedy.",6,1,1,24 July 2019
Pulp Fiction," Completely Overrated
","Senseless storytelling. What was the point? What was the beginning? What was the ending? There wa no time to get to know any of the characters, there was no clear plot point/climax, and I felt pretty disengaged with everyone and everything happening. 'It's so meaningful' is what I normally read in the reviews... but how?? Loads of things happen but it ends up feeling like nothing happens.Boring. You can find better films.",1,4,15,4 March 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," So amazing
","The emotions, the plot, originality, everything tied together so well at the end - normally I criticise the way movies end, but this ending was phenomenal, not cliche at all. The brutality of the prison was well portrayed, and made me feel sorry for the characters.All the characters were believable and had depth, and none of the scenes were dramatic, but there was tension throughout the film. I'm going to stop fangirling now, but this movie is my favourite tied with the Godfather!!",10,0,0,1 October 2019
Goodfellas," Interesting plot, shallow characters
","While the plot was pretty great and fairly unpredictable, I couldnt relate to any of the characters. They all seemed shallow to me, and I couldn't understand them at all. Also the Carol monologues were so random, she was so weird.But yeah, it was pretty entertaining, and the ending was acceptable, although I felt it could have been better.",6,1,3,4 October 2019
