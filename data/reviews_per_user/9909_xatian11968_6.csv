Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Artistic license that entertains
","This was an entertaining movie (haven't read the book), I'd give it a 5 for effort. Two more points for CGI. So 7. There were moments where you cringed at the historical presumption and various inaccuracies, and I laughed at the candles that didn't flicker; and sometimes Walker's close up made you want to strangle him for his Abe portrayal (see it in 3D). Sure I'd watch it maybe once more, for the really artistically mindful CGI, costuming and set dressing. The opening storybook deconstruction of the District of Columbia really made your eye wander if you know the layout of that city; and the White House sets brought to comfy life many scenes in 1860s Washington that are otherwise historically black and white ((less the errors in some of the south facing outdoor sequences with the monument) (that blue and white blanket on the bed! Where can I get one?)).This of course all comes after I divorced myself from the ethics of using the Civil War era with slavery based on some large stereotypes. The assumption of Mackie's character was a novel one none-the-less. At least Cruise's Lestat had the decency to keep history as a side story, and not turn the back story of the 16th president into make-believe. Regardless of the latter, yes, two thumbs up as something to do. Cooper is very stylish, as well as Winstead (who knew Mary Todd could look that warm), in costuming that even you might consider wearing in modern 1860s. Frutiger, Carasik, Avdyushko & Poggioli did a good a job. And all around, if you like vampires and got nothing better to do with 15 bucks to burn, sure, it's a fun interpretation that a President is a vampire slayer named Abraham. Be warned this is not historical fiction; this is a vampire slasher story with a man named Lincoln who acts and looks like someone else we know who also lived in a cabin outside Springfield, Illinois.",7,2,4,2 July 2012
The Theory of Everything," Maybe reading Mrs. Hawking's book is a better investment than watching this film
","This film took an incredible amount of dedication to get through; I even had to break it up between two days. Eddie Redmayne's portrayal did such a good job of showing the 'silverspooned' flippancy, and associated arrogance of anyone lucky enough to get into Cambridge, that half way through you're almost glad that Hawking's ego was tempered by fate and ALS. Guy gets into boys' club, Guy gets into aristocracy, Guy gets pretty girl, and it's all about the Guy, with very little science thrown in. Certainly the script was gleamed from the first Mrs. Hawking's work, but after some thought at the film's end, you wonder if Hawking's ALS was the single most deciding factor that provided the 'thinking man' time to think himself to greatness. After all, great men come from great sacrifice, and Mr. Hawking's great sacrifice was that he no longer could experience life the way the rest of humanity experiences it. The film certainly had an air of 'Cambridge guy does film about another Cambridge guy' love only a fellow Cambridge guy and the old boys' club would appreciate., The rest of the 99.9% of us are left with less than a real look into the source as to why Hawking was famous (as was the compelling root of similar films like Russell Crowe's 'A Beautiful Mind'). Even after desperately waiting for Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) to share some much needed humility we're even grasping for deeper development of Dennis Sciama, PhD. But after trudging through the fiction that was Alan Touring's re-telling, it's not hard to believe that Cumberbatch and Redmayne are friends, as they are more apt to tell the story as they see it, as opposed to the way the story was as history experienced it.To quote Kirk Lazarus from 'Tropic Thunder': 'Everybody knows you never go full retard.' Eddie Redmayne certainly took that advice to heart, supposedly almost to the point of experiencing his own spinal damage in the making of this dull film. You'd certainly get a better return, and a heck of a lot more 'Stephen Hawking' watching television's 'Big Bang Theory' than you could from Redmayne's the theory of making a very boorish film. For every intellectual movie-goer out there who already knows Hawking's disabilities, you'll get nothing more than what you already knew from Redmayne's portrayal, and for those searching to know Hawking more, well then you just may not like Hawking after Eddie Redmayne's rendition of him.",2,6,11,31 May 2015
Lincoln," Wait for the DVD to come out, or buy a Lincoln Standee.
","Though I went to this film with great hopes of some artistic integrity teamed with a modern lens, I was very disappointed in 'Lincoln.' It is yet another poorly executed film with all the best intentions that fails to do anything more than add yet another bad time piece to a long line of dull stereotypical portrayals of Lincoln and Washington D.C. in 1865 Civil War America.All around this film is best seen at home; where the viewer can willfully decide to change the channel, or stop the DVD gladly knowing he paid little more than a dollar at the rental machine as opposed to suffering through a $15 dollar ticket 'razzie' nominee. This film is a grotesque platitude to the 2012 genre of politically correct films that does nothing more than prop up a Daniel Day Lewis pretending to be Lincoln - where a cardboard standee of Lincoln would do just fine. For all those people who find this movie gripping or amazing, I can only say that these are the same people that would find paint drying compelling.A recent movie 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' did far more to add to the collection of time piece films than this awful Spielberg work. In the former vampire film, Lincoln is human and believable with a Mary Todd that is both alive and strikingly relatable. In Sally Fields' portrayal she is 'the' faded photograph that is deservedly buried under the annals of more agreeable history. Fields' Todd Lincoln is both an anachronism of bad 1980s housewives, and a questionable recreation of a history you can't but help scratch your head asking, is this really how the 17th First Lady was? The staging of the film was needlessly dark. We all get this is a time piece, but Spielberg decided against better judgment that 1865 was the literal dark ages, as most of the scenes were shadowy juxtaposed against glaring back lighting the flooded out most detail of the sets, the costuming, and the actors themselves. The lighting designer was a willing accomplice as the only bright and lively scene of remark in the film was the white washed facades of a far too bright Capital that architecturally looked no different than the White House. All the manner of costuming also seemed to find inspiration in the clothes rubbish bin that even Fieval from 'Fieval Goes West' would be apt to pass on as just outright dull for humanity.But let's return to Daniel Day Lewis. I had difficulty discerning whether he was portraying Abe Lincoln or fellow modern day actor Jay Baruchel. Lewis' portrayal was forgettable at how unremarkable it was; as I said before, a cardboard standee would have made a better performance because cardboard can't speak. Lewis was so full of himself in his portrayal of Abe Lincoln, his monotonous rehashing of Lincoln quotes was like watching a high school acting troop trying to pull a full blown production of Macbeth, and carried the same acting value.The rest of the ensemble did little to add/ save the film, and in some cases made it worse. The Lincoln sons were well dull. Lincoln's cohorts weren't portrayals of fellow contemporaries, but came off as - Lincoln turned religious icon - subscribers bowing to a man who couldn't utter a wrong opinion. Todd Lincoln's lady in waiting was questionable and utterly lost in the PC portrayal of the Free African life let alone the slave situation. And the free Africans themselves were relegated to the peanut gallery as mere props. In one scene, an entire telegraph war communications room fell silent so Lewis' Lincoln could wax plastically on the strategy of his legacy. All around, the dynamics of the economic war that was the Civil War was lost in the political correct portrayal that only went so far as to say that 'slavery was bad, mmkay' and did nothing to illustrate the situation in the House of the Representatives of the Nation at war up to that time.Tommy Lee Jones, Hal Holbrook, David Strathairn, Jared Harris, Christopher Boyer, et al. – all great men who struggled to do their best in a film that struggled to even do just okay. And the stereotypical final Ford's Theatre scene is omitted, after Spielberg painstakingly forces the viewer to sit through January to April 1965, and then the viewer isn't even invited into Spielberg's Ford's Theatre. Overall, this film was a sad attempt among many sad attempts to bring to life History. That being said, perhaps Lincoln's true life can't be envisioned without bowing to the religious following Lincoln's legacy has become, where the man can do no evil because he was never human to begin with",2,22,52,16 November 2012
Edge of Tomorrow," Left desiring a lot more with a film budget like this, more about Cage than aliens
","I had hopes for 'Edge of Tomorrow,' because Tom Cruise was rumored to have actually done a decent job for the film. The plot started out even enough, and of course got interesting when the main battle sequence got started. Then it all fell apart, and the entire film amounted to a repeat of the last 10 minutes of the first 20 minutes of the film for the entire 113 minute running time. The alien storyline was great, different, and had legs before you knew their weaknesses. But those legs were cut off in the mundane replay of watching the leads' hunt down the real reason behind their adversary's success which had little to do with the aliens themselves and more to do with watching Tom Cruises race through the same old paces. This, in the totality of the film, completely stopped the involvement of the actual aliens in the storyline action; and shifted the entire storyline to watching Tom Cruise repeat himself. Over. Over. Over and Over again.On Tom Cruise's character, viewers got a little background, as the apt 'Groundhog Day' story style comparison truncated this development because the time-line jumped back so many times, that viewers had an opportunity to cease caring about the character. Tom Cruise did a great job on not being Tom Cruise. Sadly though, the script left him with little to work with. Now had the story kept pace - without the always questionable suggestion that time could be meddled with, merely by a single alien intelligence â€“ we would have gone on to find a serious story about alien technology or some other interesting creation. Alas not though. The one world paradigm of the film's society glimpse was dull too, and didn't do much to convey the story; the film didn't have the community ownership as in the way 'Twenty-eight Days Later' offered British connection to the Island, and its landmarks. In fact it was a distraction as you never knew anything about the type of society Tom Cruise's character was coming from, except to know it was in the future and that the Eiffel Tower & I.M. Pei's Pyramid lasted long enough in history to be destroyed in the film (though the prize of the film was not located in the same place as the Holy Grail is in 'Da Vinci Code'). Aliens, yes. Relatable humans, no. The military themselves seemed pretty much a transfer of the crew from Sigourney Weaver's 'Alien', right down to the stereotypical 'Latina' character, and of course the obligatory half-naked-eight-packed 'sexy white guy' in the thread of Casper Van Dien's 'Starship troopers.' The success of the story is that you are never given a chance to know anything more about the alien intelligence, except that they really don't like humans. Much in the same way of 'War of the Worlds.' We get the 'all powerful alien, with glaring weaknesses' fit into a 113 minute time-line; but this is to a viewer-ship that never gets a detailed film/story about aliens, like we get a detailed 'Mission Impossible' story of conspiracy in other Cruise films - we are left to wonder whether a good alien take-over film can be done in 113 minutes. There also seemed to be some 'Scientology' rhetoric thrown into the story line for good measure as well, especially in the tone of 'past-lives'. At any rate, the film was great going in, but petered out twenty minutes after the story rolled. I'll be blunt and say, Emily Blunt was awesome carrying the film, though I could have waited for the Red-Box debut!",4,6,17,24 June 2014
The Big Short," Just boring.
","Some 52 minutes into the film, an actor in one of the many buddy buddy scenes breaks the fourth wall and takes a two second gaze directly into the camera. I shut if off at that point, and thanked my lucky stars I didn't contribute to the cinema studio's take at the movie theater. This film really felt like just another 'popular boys theater club' spending money on a poor script just because everyone was 'hot' and popular, and 'ballin like wall street'. It played like a poor person's film: flashy, big chested, long di¢ked, frat house rude. There was no sophistication in it. It felt like the outcast step brother to Leo DeCaprio's Wall Street junk stock mayhem. Sure, Steve Carroll has his moments, but this certainly was not one of them. And Christian Bale, he could have done a better job if he just grunted through the entire film like he did in 'Batman'....tis a shame that the 2012 film 'Capital' was received less than this new rendition of 'why I got rich.' The Big Short felt like a home brew from the local men's club after hours.... I didn't stay tuned to see if the breasts from Jordan Belfort and Jonah Hill's version made a cameo.",2,2,5,17 April 2016
The Great Gatsby," 10 for Fitzgerald. 5 for this remake
","I loved the book as did everyone else, but as the age old advice heeds, 'see this movie with an open mind.' Well I did, and I can say that I am not so disappointed, it is okay, but just okay.From the start it was hard to divorce the voice of the Nick Carraway from the nasal interpreter found in Tobey Maguire. I never imagined Nick Carraway as annoying, but Tobey Maguire certainly did inspire my want to reach into the screen and slap him for making the character into such a sullied bore. Though the opening sequences were okay enough, it was really the original work shining through the cracks that made this film entertaining. Sure the shots were beautiful, the CGI Mansion was large, and the parties at West Egg looked interesting, but this new film adaption made me wanting for something new, the exact feeling I had after watching Robert Redford's attempt.Of course, Gatsby was like Titanic; you knew the ship was going into the drink, but DiCaprio had a harder challenge with Gatsby, because everyone knew what and who Gatsby was - unlike Jack Dawson. Perhaps that was Maguire's problem, being that he had such huge shoes to fill, frankly he was a very bad choice as this lead character. Maguire's attempt came off as yet another high school rendition of Shakespeare's best without the spider-man tights.All of this is not to say that this film wasn't entertaining. In fact, as the credits began to roll the audience was captivated at its end. As the silence crept into peoples' awareness, that in fact, the movie had indeed ended, I wondered whether it was the book's echoed emotion that had gripped the movie-goers so much or this film. I did conclude rightly, that it was Fitzgerald's words that had stunned the theater, and not Baz Luhrmann. You can put a pig in a dress and apply lipstick, but you know it's just a pig. On the other hand, the strong base of this novel can give wings to any interpretation, good or just okay, and that is what this film is – another okay interpretation of a storied and favorite book (a modern book that does not age, unlike the modern film that gets dated and old). Ten stars for Fitzgerald, five stars for effort, and those stars all go to DiCaprio alone because Jay Gatsby came alive in DiCaprio's eyes, where Redford's didn't.",5,1,3,19 May 2013
