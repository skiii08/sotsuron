The Lobster," Boooooring
","De only thing i really enjoyed is the way this movie was shot.Great camera work.And the locations are beautiful.The rest of it is very meager.The story leads to nothing,You are watching this and then when it's trough you keep on wondering 'what was it about'? it's very unsatisfying. The story is bizar and when it starts you are kind of drawn into it but halfway trough you start to worry where it's going to lead you to.I't was'nt worth my time. it drags on and on. i'm surprised how this film keeps popping up in the best of 2015 lists. It is extremely boring i.m.o. I can enjoy clue-less movies but The Lobster had to little to keep me interested. Acting might be good , but the story is it's weakest point i guess.Had kind of a 'hangover'when it was done.",2,29,45,20 February 2016
Black Book," Mediocre Film
","IMO Blackbook is one of the worst films ever made about a war situation. It looks like a schoolboy-adventure series. but very badly executed ! The props are so badly constructed...it looks very artificial. It's supposed to resemble the Netherlands during WW II..but everything looks soooo clean ....the script...well how bad can it be ? I was watching this film just for the fun of it...before i started out with Blackbook , i supposed it would be bad..but...it was far worse ! one childish scene after another.... and than the acting ..Wow ! that's terrible...Guy's like f.i Peter Blok , Derek de Lint ( so called ) great actors here in the lowlands.. the director made a mess of it....A Real dutch Paul Verhoeven film : some 'Pasionate '(haha)sex , a few naked tits here & there .., Glen Miller during liberation scenes and yes , another piece of dutch history beiing made visible.... i could not believe that Zwartboek is taken that seriously in the dutch entertainment world.... it's shocking , in a way...The Dutch nominee for the academy awards....by lack of something better i suppose... Zwartboek was a terribly made film in every aspect but i had a very entertaining time while watching it. Time well-spend after all...'caus what fun i had seeing this 'film'.",1,16,44,10 July 2007
127 Hours," Booooooring
","This is a unbelievably super-overrated boooring piece of S&*(t. I just cannot believe that it's been put foreward as a serious Chance maker for the Oscars. the whole film we see this one guy, traped after a wandering accident...until he decides to do something drastic to change his situation.Nothing is happening to keep you keep you interested. I truly believe that the only success of this 'film 'is it's reputation...that's why folks watch it. it is to Me the most boooring(one off at least) Films i have ever seen. How interesting can you keep on watching a guy how cant move more than e few centimeter's.Despite some flashy editing and some supposedly dreamlike sequences. terrible,Yakk. But..OK to me the Oscars for years already are never something to be taken seriously... This nomination does prove my view. It's the marketing and rumours about this thing that draws the viewers.the main sequence even is not so much horrific and lacking of real guts by the director.it's..well kinda lame...",1,22,51,27 February 2011
Brokeback Mountain," A ' Big ' Movie..
","touching & heartbreaking , this story of 2 'Cowboy's who don't make their dream , to be together , come true... There is nothing that's not human surfacing in this film.emotions are real , and the acting is excellent and convincing.Reminds me highly of Clint Eastwood's bridges of Madison county'... Ang Lee succeeded in creating a masterpiece here...and it's being told in an honest way. And the guts of Ang to use such a controversial theme needs to be highly applauded. Brokeback Mountain is definitely a 'must ' for everybody who loves to be moved by Cinema.The setting and photography in this film are magnefique and overwhelming.A true 'classic'...",10,15,18,22 August 2007
Zodiac," Chilling & Fabulous
","I found ZODIAC an amazingly good made movie. excellent acting by all participants , a chilling-based on true facts story and a haunting hunt for a serial killer with a clever ending. From the 1th second till the last this movie kept me glued on my chair... the music , long 'forgotten ' 60-70-ies pop songs work really good to produce that era.camera photography , use of color etc.nothing bad can be told about it.although ZODIAC does'nt belong to my favorite genre of Films.this one ' got me by the b*ll's !!Amazing ! Very near perfect !!This film is highly entertaining. One of the best in it's sort.",10,1,2,17 July 2007
Milk," Amazing & Important
","Milk is a Fabulous film.in every way. trough it's photography and coloring...it takes us right back to the optimistic era in the 70-ies in which we find ourselves in San Fransisco in the gay-rights-activists scene off-which Harvey Milk was the Motor. Wow the acting of Sean Penn is beyond believe ! He really becomes Harvey Milk and his every breath say's so in this movie.Gus van Sandt brings us this important film in the right time...just now f.i in m my country , Gay right are very much in decline of acceptance due to various morals , laid upon us by so called religious tendencies. a dangerous development.more and more the gay's are getting back in the closet in fear of being beaten up or whatever.., f.i.in the city of Amsterdam what used to be ' the gay Capital of the world'.a shame. so lets watch MILK and realize the struggle these people had to go trough...and realize the difference in our humanity...and realize that God (if there is one)created everyone of us Gay's heterosexuals alike. Milk is a touching and inspiring hopeful film with a very sad ending. It gives us a totally believable account of what had happened.",10,1,5,2 March 2009
Pan's Labyrinth," Great piece of ' art '
","This is a really BIG film. Big in it's message ...Big in the way it's been made... What a great team has been working on this parade of magnificent images.. And how beautiful is this story of Love/the good VS Hate/the bad is being told. Against the setting of the aftermath of the Spanish civil war we see a touching and really moving episode in the life of a loving young girl , Ofelia , who makes up her own world in which she can escape to get out of her harsh reality. She's meeting spiritual , wonderful creatures who guide her trough a very hard episode in her young , discovering life.....GO , see & feel this immensely touching film....One of the great highlights in cinema EVER !",10,2,5,7 July 2007
Control," Very , very , very ' thin '
","Corbijn is a Photographer.He likes Black and white atmosphere's. That's about the only thing I could ' enjoy ' in this honestly extremely meager film.An assumption Corbijn himself must know , is that to be a Filmmaker takes a totally other discipline (IMO) than to be a still photographer. This Film lacks a lot of elements that make it interesting. Anton Corbijn is no film director.He did'nt succeed to put any depth into the character of Ian Curtis nor in any of the others.... Corbijn did not succeed in enfolding the mystery of Curtis's struggle with life.He doesn't get beyond atmospherically sketches , which might work in a photograph , but which do NOT work in this film. I am amazed by the positive way this pic.is received. Anton Corbijn certainly did not put any dept in the existence of the great music by the Joy Division. IMO it would have been better to have left that story to what is was.I honestly cannot see what extra load has been put to the sad life and death of a seriously depressed person , who happened to be a Cult Singer and who decided to end his , in his view , miserable life.ps:even the 'darkness'of Ian Curtis's life has no layer whatsoever in this film.utterly hollow and thin.I mean Corbijn does certainly not succeed in showing us the conditions as to what drove Ian to his death. I mean , Ian was very depressed ,but nowhere in the film ,apart from 2 or three occasions where a voice-over tells his ' dark ' view at the world , does this fact become eminent.I could enjoy some of Anton's frame compositions , his photographic view , but that's about all that.If mend to be an Ian Curtis character study....a total failure.",2,30,57,29 December 2007
Jackie," Focussing on Hilarious & fake Jackie Kennedy voice spoiled the movie for me
","Now this is one boooring movie. Why is it that if one plays an historical figure..the actor needs to present itself as close as possible to the original but with the focus on the wrong details? The most terrible aspect of this film is the fact that Portman has to speak, master the same dixie, as Jackie Kennedy. If one hears Jackie Kennedy speak on old footage it sounds natural...it's her. But listening to Portman is tiresome..she sounds sooo artificial and unnatural..and that's because she isn't speaking with her own voice. All that matter's is the character portrayal isn't it? even if the voice is different. or not so articulate....i't like when in those war movies an actor playing a German has to speak English with a 'German'accent.Sounds crazy ass hell. We'll...the only thing i could enjoy a bit in watching this was the music score, but that 's about it! Portman should'v given the voice a subtler input ( a director thing) and really present Jackie through the effect of her portrayal of the character.",2,2,6,25 February 2017
No Country for Old Men," Hangover - film
","The beginning and suspense in this film are OK... and even maybe above average...... You wonder what's behind the gruesome finding of Llewellyn.... Some crazy guy (who won an Oscar !!!! why ?)decided to hunt him down , commits a few meagerly horrifying murders in a maybe 'original' photographed way , on the way and that's about it.... I like other stuff i'v seen by the Coens..but this...well....it could'nt reach me as did Fargo for instance... Even the whole appearance of the Psygo-killer.. why is he who he is , what's his drive etc is all left in the open.....no depth at all in his character.... NCFOM contains some elements seen in Tarantino movies (but done far better )...some David Lynch (done far more bestrangening)....maybe i missed the whole point but the tittle NCFOM suggests that the form and reality of todays crime is far more terrible than it was in the 'good old day's'... any way , that's what i got out of it...a Weak filmshowing the 'Oscars' are a Hoax !",2,2,6,6 March 2008
Revolutionary Road," Grand Crap
","This film was terrible....i could'nt believe how badly constructed it was. the 'most ' unforgivable fault was to cast Leonardo di Caprio for his role. He was soooo unconvincing in depicting his character.the relationship between Blanchet en Leonardo looked like that of a schoolteacher (Blachet) putting in on with her favorite student somewhat later in the movie it looked like Mother/son.....di Caprio was totally miscast-ed. then the story...unbelievable weak in execution....I mean fi. here is an urban family with two daughters which are hardly ever to be seen..... the couple's verbal, loud fights are never interrupted by crying children who wanted to know what's going on... the Drama...it was not Drama enough and the director never convinces in telling us the 'tragedy'.... the clue was meager and predictable..... a film which will be forgotten quickly.... the hardest to swallow part: a mediocre role by a wrongly casted Di Caprio.(like boy scout captain?)who should only play roles fitting his age or search a better make-up artist.",1,14,29,27 March 2009
City of God," An insight into a Horrifying wonderland...
","Especially everybody in my part of the world /the 'rich' countries , should see this film. The incredible hardness of day to day existence is breathtaking... Live in the Favella's is like living in hell... a place where one can be shot by 11 year old kids at random.... There is nowhere where a threatened person can turn to.... they cannot go to the police because they are a big part of the problem.they too cash on in on the earnings of the favella gangs . Corruption violence death , drugs & destruction...the reality in Brazil's Favella's , Ghetto's.. A life of no hope , no love and no Humanity...its heartbreaking !The Film is sooo well made , creative solutions for difficult problems in shooting under these conditions..wow , what a great job they did !Films like this are sooo important.. this mission is certainly accomplished !See this film !, FEEL this film....",10,3,6,30 June 2007
The Theory of Everything," Very meager
",I found this movie to be very thin.This is a quite boring and traditionally made biopic of Steven Hawking.I was hoping it would be showing us more of an insight into the brilliant mind of Steven.It does not.It's subject is more or less: how to cope & go on living with a very disabled person as a spouse.I'v understood that the base of the film was the book by Jane hawking Stevens wife.Although one might say that the main character gives us good acting....it brings us nothing.IMO.it's just a sentimental 13 in a dozen biopic and never original. a missed opportunity!It would be far more interesting if we got more offered why Steven Hawking is such an immensely important scientist.,2,10,19,8 February 2015
The Lives of Others," Tastefully done
","I enjoyed watching this film.I Liked it's kinda ' slow ' tempo...the rhythm of the movie.... The greatest Actor in it IMO was The guy who played Wiesler...the Stasi apparatchik who at the end showed he still had a ' feeling heart ' left for the life of other people.The end was touching to me...( where he finds the to himself dedicated book by Laslo...)I found the portraying of Life in the DDR well executed...the burocratic inhumane atmosphere in which folks east of the German wall had to live...The everyone is listening - choking - sphere....One scene , imo , was'nt too well done ....the scene where the 'betraying' actress runs out of the apartment and got killed by an on-storming truck.then we see laslo coming down and holding the dying woman..after that the Stasi gang comes out of the building and are reacting very unnatural IMO to the scene that plays in front of their eyes.... I found this scene hard to believe...but an entertaining movie anyhow... and reasonably well done.",7,2,6,25 June 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Warm
","Clint Eastwood is a man with , as we call it in the Netherlands) , a 'small' heart.A heart that's easely touched and moved by the force & drive of humanity. He succeeds in giving us people a feeling towards each-other.Hillary Swank succeeds 100% under Clints direction , in presenting us a incredibly believable character.She is a Huge actress.Her impersonation of Maggie and her Fight for Life in the broadest sense of the word , moved me deeply. all acting was great and convincing.The Story/script....Yes....., sentimantal at times , but never unreal or conceited. I was pleasantly surprised that the film was'nt packed with boxing scenes..(not my cuppa..so to say...) but with 'human interaction'...that was the message in this beautiful and touching story of a lovable Darling with Power , who found her truthfully supporter.until the end. A Moving Classic !!!",10,4,6,23 September 2008
Into the Wild," Boring movie with sad ending
","At first i wasn't too sure about showing us all that was happening in this film. a lonely cross - country hiker trying' to find peace within himself , blaming' his upbringing... it goes on & on....with not much highlights when he's on the road. a lonely romantically depressed guy..... Just when i was going to shut it down cause it could'n kept me watching anymore....The ending showed us that this was actually based on a true story. I felt sorry for his ' undergoing ' in nature , his sliding out of sanity & life.... his miserable loneliness. some nice nature shots , but far too long lasting.Penn should have taken one hour off-it.Would have made a stronger movie !",7,0,2,12 March 2008
Eyes Wide Shut," Weak
","Having just seen the great Documentary on Stanley Kubrick's Life ' Stanley Kubrick ,'A life in pictures',and realizing what a great and formidable Director this creative artist was , I realized i'd never seen Eyes Wide Shut.His last Film.So I sat myself down watching it.It was a Disappointment.At Someplace during the ongoing movie it looked to me as if someone was imitating a Stanley Kubrick Film.It was Kubrick himself.This is not a great creative work but a rather mediocre and middle of the road-ish piece of amusement.nothing more.some very corny scenes ,like the 'secret 'sex'offering at the strange house '..this was very childish and 'cheaply' executed...... Some scene set ups and lighting still had something of the detail-obsessed film maker Stanley was.Like the ever present Xmas lighting throughout the movie.Everywhere there is the combination of red,green and white Xmas lamps...creating a beatrangening Kubrickian effect. And of course the music worked fantastically in some scenes. Acting , characters and story where very meager though. The least-good Kubrick film i'v seen so far.",4,3,9,13 March 2008
The Fountain," spiritual quest
","very entertaining movie with loads of spirituality. Accompanying music works fantastically with this film. Reminded me most of some ancient Buddhist tale...with the three of life , the 'prince' siting under it 'n all... I guess it's a story about love and life..and how we as human beings struggle in this immensely uncertain universe which is very hard for us to comprehend. This film carries with it the great questions of life...where do we come from and to where is life taking us....In ' the fountain ' we are heading for a bright and wonderful future.as said before : a great symbiosis between film and music.highly entertaining !",7,1,2,6 July 2007
Mystic River," Good & unsatisfying
","I enjoyed this very well acted movie. The actors and casting in this was phenomenal.the story was very intriguing ... until the ending.thinking about it i find the end very dissatisfying...and unrealistic.I mean. now i get the impression that the Sean Penn character ' walks'..not very believable considering the connection he and his victim have.... and the fact that the Dave character is still supposedly a killer , 'cause he necked a pedophile is also very far-sought...the film/story should have been sticking to the 'mugger' story... but...the atmosphere and acting in superb. a shame it ended as it did.unsatisfying.Clint Eastwood is a great director.a minor , bur serious nit in this film though did'nt make it a masterpiece.",7,0,1,16 December 2008
The Departed," Very Middle-of-the-road
","The Departed might be enjoyable as a television show or whatever , but I cannot consider calling this film high-end-cinema. predictable it is...even corny now and then (the 'flashy ' shoot-out at the warehouse at the end...f.i.) Even the casting of the 2 opposite main characters , diCaprio & Damon , not good chosen as enemy's.... sometimes hard to keep apart , but OK , their acting was sort of fine.... As well..., the film lasted far too long for the story told. Scorsese could have taken at least an hour of ...and still not losing any essentials. the story is quite weak IMO ,( as soon as I saw the envelope with ' citizen ' written on it , I knew this would play a key role in the discovery '-I call that predictable)Nicholsons character well OK , very soon you def.start to hate the guy... , but.... not one of his finest performances.the Scorsese Film i saw before this one , the Dylan documentary ' touched me immensely more as did this film... But that one's in a different catalog i realize...Films like ' the Departed ' are made a lot in celluloid country aren't they ?.., and that's nothing special ain't it ?ps: and ..what's the point in having the 2 opposites 'sharing ' the same girlfriend ?never got that...",3,0,3,27 June 2007
There Will Be Blood," Vague experience
","I liked the way the film was photographed....looked like some use of video format or whatever.coloring and angle's gave it a typical atmosphere which i could enjoy . liked the 'literary' darkness.... and enjoyed the use of music. But.....the story....either not a good story or not being handled good by Anderson.a bit of a mess.... all the time i kept hoping that there would be some sense in the things that happened in the movie.I still don't know. Am i right believing that the main message is that evil prevails? if so , the evil is not evil enough in the Plainview character and the good in the other folks is not clear enough too. maybe i did't got it.. but that's not necessarily my fault.",4,8,15,14 March 2008
The Good Shepherd," Goes on and on...
","Not a good movie ! The casting of Damon as the father , senior figure is totally out of place.He does'nt convince me for one second as the strong character he 's supposed to portray.As is Jolie in her role...not good.too much hollywoodygoody sentimentality here... !In more than one scene Father and Son stand together talking or whatever and one gets the impression they are two friends.There's not enough convincing age-difference between them and that's (imo) an unforgivable mistake.(in this case anyway...) makes it look silly. This film could have been told in half the time it's now taken... the relation between the historical ocurances is too fragmented and doesn't convince for one bit ! although it might have been de Niro's plan to portray a totally gray & emotionless patriotic Superspy in the Wilson character.., he does fail badly in his attempts. The overall film is indeed dull and takes too long to come to it's predictable conclusion.it does'nt convince me to believe what's been told. a hollow movie ..after all. i'm ' sorry '...",1,18,30,21 June 2007
Munich," Spielberg ?
","I watched this film without the knowledge that is was a Steven Sielberg Film. I found it a very badly executed film en was wondering who this 3e rate director might have been ? Steven Spielberg ? the same ? come on...! This film is so utterly badly constructed it makes you ashamed. the way the story is told is sooo very unbelievable...the characters are no way convincing. and why is the guy stuffing his wife in the end and are we treated as to what his imagination is seeing about what happened with the athletes ? the totally unrealistic appearance of the secret information company & the guy called Louis ? wow now that was a BAD part...why and how can this mysterious family obtain information that the Mossad can not ?more like a fairytale then a seriously made aftermath-of Munich Film.terrible.some bad films still can be fun to watch...but this one left me with a hangover , Spielberg ? come on !!",2,1,6,7 August 2008
In the Land of Blood and Honey," Directional/creative Misser.
","I am no Serb/Croat/Bosnian... the film tells nothing about events i have encountered whatsoever so i have no interest whatsoever in choosing sides..,I am Just someone who enjoys cinema if it's good.But...this Film held almost nothing pour moi.The script seemed to lead nowhere..i seriously had the feeling a few times that the Director lost all control as to where we where heading.I mean we watch a couple dancing..suddenly there's an explosion en after that there is no reference to that explosion what so ever.When they later meet again, it's as if they never saw each other before.The character studies are awfully weak and stereotypical...why bother witch Photographical composition, well lit scenes etc.when awful things like mass-rape are taking place...I'v read in other reviews ' but it was very beautifully photographed' in this story that's a weakness IMO.In the first part we see the main character,Aijla wearing a lovely yellow coloured sweater..which gives great looking camera color & compositions and atmosphere...but...why? Why still bother which such details to make thing look good on a screen while mass rape and murder is taking place? some script changes are absolutely ridiculous and very far fetched.. another nuisance...the constant very close-up manner of filming the battle scenes..i found that disturbing and a style figure.....and yes.., many people complain about this ,..in this film about the Bosnian carnage the focus lies on the Serbian atrocities during this war..but that's no problem IMO..this film is a story about what happened to a part of the Bosnian victims.The Serbian side of the Bosnian-war story may be told by another film... My main objection is the creative shortcoming. It,to me was a boring movie.and should hold lessons in Filmmaker/vision For Jolie.Next time better !This film to me looked like a schoolgirls naive-sentiment in viewing the horror's of war. But those horrors were not presented in a horrible way... i presume the situation in reality was hell. We see a very stylish hell..with neat framed scenes , an unbelievable and for me, totally distant sort of 'love' story.., a very weak script to act on it must have been for the actors... , nice clothing and beautiful light.I was really in awe as to where the story took me..very far-fetched and naive. and the casting ...very much stereo-typing..not a creative choice of cast.Why have them speak American with a Balkan accent? you see this in a lot of films...to make it 'more realistic..but it easily becomes mediocre...It's far better & stronger to have them speak either Serb-Croatian or plain English... I never understand why they do that....and do not break-away from such a film-making dogma.let this 1th directional misser be a lesson For Jolie !",3,294,473,18 February 2012
