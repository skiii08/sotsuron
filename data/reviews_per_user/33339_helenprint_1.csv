The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Simply Amazing
","Words can not describe how great the movie is. I didn't have highest expectations, But I can definitely say that the directer did an amazing job and the acting is so much better. Of course the first film is always best.. But now after seeing breaking dawn, New Moon And Eclipse were very disappointing. The thing I liked the most is how little things from Twilight (first movie) was also used in breaking dawn, like the music and a little montage it kind of gives closure to the story. I'm not a hardcore fan but the twilight sage will always have a special place in my heart. Even though you think the book is stupid, don't be so harsh. Give it a chance you never know you might like it.",Null,6,17,21 November 2011
