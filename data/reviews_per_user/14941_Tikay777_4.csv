The Avengers," What I liked about Avengers
","I was waiting for the Avengers ever since I heard that they would make a movie with this theme and scenario. Having watched all the previous films with the superheroes that supposedly would form the first Avengers team (Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk) I have to admit that I was very anxious as some of them didn't quite leave up to my expectations. Although to be honest my expectations sometimes can be quite high.The movie didn't disappoint me at all. The lines and the acting of everyone involved I think were ranging from very good to exceptional. The movie doesn't bore you with the background of its characters since you are supposed to be already aware of their past. And the combat scenes I think that they had the right amount of humor and action to make them a fan's wet dream.Therefore I highly recommend to everyone, fan or no fan to watch it.And now all we have to wait is Prometheus and Dark Knight Rises :)",9,2,6,15 May 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," One of the top three movies in 2011
","I have to say that like most people I hadn't heard of the Millennium series or Stieg Larsson before his death. Upon hearing all the fuss about the books I wanted to see for myself if this was one of those posthumous things. Well as many of you know it wasn't and the three books are some of the very best in their kind. Now I have read them and have recommended them almost to anyone I know and asks me about a good book.That said about the books before watching the American version (and having watched the Swedish versions) I have to admit I was expecting to be disappointed in that I didn't expect it to be better or even the same as its Swedish counterpart. Well it was one of the best movies I saw in 2011 along with Drive.Some people say that it does not smell of Sweden. Well the movie is a Hollywood film, and you can't expect from someone not of Swedish culture to depict aspects of Sweden as they truly are (they even forgot that Sweden uses Celcius and not Fahrenheit). If you judge the movie objectively and without having in mind the books and how much stuff from the books are missing as I hear a lot (which is true but also shouldn't matter) you will see that this movie as what it truly is, a thriller that won't let you stop watching even for a minute.I also heard a lot that the movie has a lot of sex scenes and more nudity than it should. Well to those people I say that you are going to watch a thriller describing some of the darkest aspects of the human soul and mind so you can't expect unicorns and fairies except if they were carrying shotguns. I won't go as far to say that nudism is a form of art, I leave that to history to judge, but I truly didn't mind about the sex and nude scenes in this movie.Enough of review other people's thoughts about the movie though. Rooney Mara is exceptional playing as Lisbeth Salander dark and showing that feeling of ambivalence we all have for her actions and truly deserves her nomination. Daniel Craig showed that he in not only good as James Bond but is capable of great emotion as well. All the cast performed very well and David Fincher used their assets to make an excellent film.All in all I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has read the books or has seen the Swedish adaptations of the books and wants to compare, or anyone who wants to see a good thriller and an excellent movie.",9,2,7,28 January 2012
Dark Shadows," Not as good as it should be, but still a good movie
","I was waiting for this movie for a while mostly because of the presence of Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeifer, Grace Chloe Moretz and Jackie Earl Haley who is one of my personal favorites.I must say I quite enjoyed the first half of the movie but was a bit disappointed by the second half by what I think was an exaggeration of combat moves and curses. Grace made an excellent werewolf (according to my humble opinion but then I am infatuated by her) although it was unnecessary for her to be one.All in all I can't say that I think my money was better spent elsewhere, but I can say that I had this feeling like with Alice that something better could be achieved with the same resources.I must add though that I absolutely loved Jackie Earl Haley's performance and for me it was a reason to watch the movie.",7,1,3,17 May 2012
Prometheus," Ripley for President
","To start I must say that I don't believe that scientists can truly be religious. I don't know about the other way around because I have yet to meet a priest that accepts the Darwin Theory for example. Or the dinosaurs.That being said, I really liked the movie because I went to see it having being told by a friend of mine that the scenario is so full of holes that you could play golf on it. So I said to myself let's watch it for Charlize Theron and Michael Fassbender and for the sake of the happy times we had with the Alien Saga. The visual effects of the movie where excellent.The feeling of the movie was a bit off at times but generally speaking it was giving a chilling effect most of the time. It's no Alien but it still is on a higher level than most movies that call themselves thriller.As for the performances I think all actors were good. Charlize wasn't the best but her performance was very good nonetheless. Noomi was good as well. Fassbender was great to a point you could actually believe he was a droid.I recommend that you watch this movie but remember to keep an open mind about the scenario otherwise you won't enjoy it.",8,2,8,13 June 2012
