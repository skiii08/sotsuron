The King's Speech," The King's Speech (2010) Wonderful with a WOW
","This is the standard in excellence for screen writing, casting, photography, Costume Design, and acting. A role model for future films to shoot for. A model in film making. This is up there with 'It's a Wonderful Life' and 'The Greatest Game Ever Played' Do you want to experience a living, breathing, classic today, You cannot go wrong seeing this great master piece of work.The power to put emotions on a piece of plastic is indescribable. I was not in the theater but I was in the theater; in other words, I was there in 1936 living, transported back in time and living history but it's a plastic film. This is the magic of a great film.",10,5,9,28 January 2011
