Miracle," Addressing some of the other comments
","Some people commenting on this movie are admittedly not hockey fans, and some are not good with their history, so I am going to offer some needed insight: 1. to the guy who commented that Noah Emmerich did a poor acting job, not showing enough emotion: This is actually a fairly representative portrayal of assistant coach Craig Patrick. Hockey coaches are often more level-headed than you might expect, and Patrick was no exception. Emmerich played him pretty darn well, actually.2. Someone asked why Kurt Russell played Brooks with a polish accent. That's not a polish accent, it's a Minnesota accent - which sounds similar, especially given the number of Polish immigrants living in the upper Midwest. If you watched Fargo, you would hear a similar accent by many of those characters.3. To the guy who said this: 'The only part of the film that was totally unnecessary was the typical Liberal slant that Hollywood just has to put in our faces every chance it gets. Here, they do it by quick cheap shots against Republican Presidents while airing an inspirational speech by Democrat Jimmy Carter.' You, my friend, are clearly no student of history. Carter's speech was considered by many then - and now - to be a disaster. Instead of having its intended effect, it instead resulted only in causing Carter's already-low favorability rating to plummet further. And it is indeed in context; the 'Malaise' speech, as it became known, fits in with the other historical elements shown at the start of the movie.4. Finally, a lot of non-hockey people complained about the lack of emotion in the characters and the acting. You would be very disappointed to find that hockey players are not over-the-top drama queens, I'm sorry to tell you. We get emotional for two things: scoring goals and winning games. At those points the movie portrayed the emotions, no? Otherwise you're not going to get a lot of drama, and the movie showed that accurately. You want drama, go interview Terrell Owens after losing a playoff game. And have fun.",9,1,1,12 February 2009
Monty Python's Life of Brian," One of the greatest comedies ever
","Absolutely the best movie Python put out, even though many will say Holy Grail was better - but I disagree. Both are phenomenally clever, though, so it's a close race. But I choose Brian for two scenes. The brilliance of the stoning scene, and the utter genius of the Latin lesson. Of course, John Cleese is in the middle of both, but do not make the mistake of thinking he carries the load; Palin's characters in the movie shine on their own (especially the sermonizer, with his long, drawn-out description of the thing they cannot find from the night before...that has an attachment), Idle is brilliant in his multiple roles (Ten shekels, you must be mad!), and the list just goes on. Perhaps the least-funny of all characters is Brian himself, but even here, Chapman's acting is superb in playing the straight man for all the jokes (which must have been tough for him!). Blasphemy? Don't be ridiculous. Even the most dogmatic would see that the movie does not poke fun at Christ; rather, it pokes fun at all of us who follow blindly, regardless of the contrary evidence put before us.",10,4,10,27 January 2005
School of Rock," Outstanding performance
","I was never a Jack Black fan, but that was mostly because I wasn't all that familiar with him. But after this performance, he's near the top of my list. I shan't discuss the plot, since so many others here have. I'm here simply to make the case to any music lover - preferably, of course ROCK music - to see this immediately. First of all, the kids are all excellent actors. Some are better than others, of course, but overall the acting is great. The kids are also very good musicians, which is not surprising when you read their education resumes after the movie. Black's performance is superb, and it's obvious that he really took a liking to the kids, not just in his character but as the actor himself. The chemistry is magnificent, and the kids are a great bunch. I would love to see what these kids are doing in 10 years; right now they're all 12 or so, with entire careers ahead of them. I liked the writing, and the fact that the writer of the movie plays one of the main characters was a neat surprise. Sarah Silverman, of course, is gorgeous, and plays her role perfectly. One of the feel-good movies that everyone in a family could watch together, and that everyone should see - especially if it turns them away from hip hop and gets them on the ROCK tip!",9,1,2,22 December 2004
