Love and Death," one of the funny ones
","Love and Death, filmed during Woody's funny period, is just that--funny. Not the low brow 'Sleeper' or 'Take the Money and Run' funny, but a slightly higher brow humour. Someone without a little knowledge of literature may miss some of the jokes, but there are plenty to go around. Woody seemed to realize at this point in his career that the thirteen year old audience member is not his target movie goer. The jokes got more sophisticated and the story lines more linear. Good, funny movie if you know anything about Russian lit. If you have no knowledge of Russian lit...the sight gags and one liners are all you'll catch. That is not a complaint. It's all about the wheat.",8,1,1,17 April 2005
The Ring," fun modern horror movie
","For a horror movie, this rocked! I watch a lot of b-movies, horror movies and slasher flicks, and this was the best movie within those genres within the last ten years ( yes that includes The Sixth Sense.) The cinematography and sound was top notch, the acted was credible and the suspense fantastic. Unlike some movies, this movie is actually creepy an may upset some with weak stomachs ( just ask my ex-wife, it creeped her out!.Naomi Watts, the lead actress in the movie, played the part of Rachel, a reporter and a single mother trying to cope with a young son named Aidan who's mental age is well higher then his actual age. Aidans cousin dies a supernatural death and chaos ensues. Bit by bit Rachel gets drawn into the web of 'the ring' via the viewing of a videotape. Soon she and her sons life are in jeopardy. Enlisting the help of her ex (and father of Aidan), they try to solve the mystery of 'the ring'.The movie is well paced and moody.However, at the 3/4 mark it jumps a little and it seems a whole segment was cut out, but otherwise was very well done. The ending, which upset some, I thought was fantastic. Too bad Hollywood put out a subpar sequel in 2005, with no doubt more to follow in future years.",10,0,1,18 April 2005
Match Point," near perfect movie
","I was soooo glad this flick finally showed up in my city. When it came out around Christmas, I knew like all Woody Allen movies, it would be in and out of the theaters quickly. However, it never showed up, even by the start of Febuary. It went to Toronto and other cities, but not here in Winnipeg.Well, this week it showed up. Thank you theater people. Thank You Woody. This was a very good, well written movie. I am not going to give away any plot points. Instead I'll comment on a criticism of the local newspaper critic who gave this film a near perfect score, but refused to give it a perfect score due to...the dream sequence. I have mixed feeling over the dream. On one hand, it throws the viewer off for a moment thinking the movie will be going one way, that perhaps retribution will be at hand. On the other side, the actor (tell me he doesn't remind you of Joaquin Phoenix?) Jonathan Rhys Meyers did a hell of a job conveying regret and fear at the end. We know he was worried he'd be caught. He knows how close he came from being investigated. So you decide. Is the movie better without it?Anyone who has a problem with 'Woody Allen' should have no problem with this film. Yes, it does remind the viewer of 'Crimes and Misdemeaners', but there is virtually no comedy this time around. Like Ned Flanders said, and I paraphrase, 'I enjoy those Woody Allen movies, with the exception of that nervous fellow that is always in them.' That character is nowhere to be found in Matchpoint. Highly recommended.",9,0,0,17 February 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," long, too long, fell asleep
","Let me be the dissenting voice in the wilderness. I don't like this series of movies.The special effects are flat out amazing but the story...ug. I just can't get into it at all. I've seen and sat through the first and third chapters, but the second one (reviewed here) bored me to sleep.I always wondered why, in sci-fi movies that have magic in them, the characters don't just magically arrive at their destination. Or go by air on some creature. These long soul building adventures just are not for me.Maybe in ten years I'll be able to appreciate this series, but not now.",2,1,4,20 April 2005
Donnie Darko," So glad I watched this.
","With well over 1600 other reviews here at IMDb, I'll be surprised if mine ever gets seen! Oh well, this is a great movie, and I want to write a review.I saw this movie for the first time 6 days ago on IFC, a Canadian movie channel. I was utterly fascinated by it by the ten minute mark. I couldn't stop watching. By the end of the movie, I had grasped the basic concept (time travel, saving the world, sacrifice for love...), but was utterly confused, but in a good way. I watched it again the next day, and though still not grasping every concept, liked it even more.At this time I decided to purchase the directors cut and watch that version. Well, it certainly cleared up a lot via the extra scenes and the commentary track (that's 4 viewings now in 6 days!) and I'm glad I saw it, but I liked the theatrical cut better. More mystery made for better viewing.The acting was topnotch, and the dialog was fantastic. The conversation about emotional problems was my personal favorite scene. The music suited this flick wonderfully also. Although I still don't understand the role of Cherita Chen in the movie (it's almost like she's the embodiment of the primary universe...far-fetched and wrong I'm sure, but that's the best I can come up with) and the role of the man in the red jogging suit. All the theories I've heard about this guy just don't add up to me, and I can't figure out the point of this character at all.As a word of advice, seek out this movie, but only watch the directors cut if you want clarity, the theatrical cut is better.",10,2,5,15 April 2006
