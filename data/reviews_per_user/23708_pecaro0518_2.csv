The Incredible Hulk," Awesome movie!
","OK, I admit it. I had no desire to see this movie at all. To me, it was way too soon after the last one with Eric Bana, and I liked that one. I bought it for my own collection, and I only buy the movies I really like. Saturday night rolled around, and my husband wanted to see it. I objected a little, giving my opinions and reasons, but going to see it anyway to make him happy.I was in for a pleasant surprise! I LOVED the movie. I really enjoyed it extremely, and fully intend to buy this one as well. The performances by both Tim Roth and Edward Norton were incredible, not surprisingly. Those two are always great in movies. I really like Liv Tyler, too. I'm enjoying seeing more of her lately. Go see this movie. It's great, you'll love it!",10,4,6,15 August 2008
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Great fun.
","Great movie! Ron Perlman is always great as Hellboy. He's funny. I like how down-to-earth and real he always seems! I love the Abe Sapien character. Very enjoyable. The special effects used for his costume are so realistic! He's such an emotional character. He reminds me of...somebody I know... I can't get over how real he looks. I'm not a big fan of Selma Blair being the girl in this movie, but that's just me. I feel like she's not warm enough. It's a very fun movie to watch. A lot of endearing moments. Great story, a lot of fun, great characters make for a great watch. The scary guys are very interesting. I think you'll like it, I liked it better than the first one!",8,0,2,15 August 2008
