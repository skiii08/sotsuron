Moneyball," There's more to it than 'Show me the money!'
","Many of my regular readers occasionally have complained that a lot of the reviews I write are somewhat negative. I try to explain that most of the films I express an opinion about have gathered just a dozen comments (or less) from other people. I feel it is a greater contribution to the knowledge database of humankind to provide the 16th slant on PAINTBALL (4 out of 10) compared to the 99th critique of MONEYBALL (10 of 10). Apparently there are quite a few people who do not care to see movies meriting just 1, 2, 3, or 4 stars of 10, let alone write about them. However, I will make an exception in the case of MONEYBALL, a movie guaranteed to send shivers up the spine of anyone who ever played organized baseball, softball, or other-ball on a ball diamond as a youth. Unlike THE NATURAL (where Robert Redford wields his 'Wonder Boy' bat to a few musical notes still heard each season in nearly every major league park, and more than a few minor league ones), MONEYBALL is based on the true history of former Detroit Tiger Billy Beane. There is a brick in front of Comerica Park in Detroit which reads 'Billy Beane, OF, 1988.' Everyone remembers 1988 was the season after the Tigers lost to the Twins in the ALCS, but led their division by about a 100 games before going a million-game losing streak. Well, in 2002 Billy Beane general managed the Oakland A's to a 21st Century record 20-game winning streak, against all odds. (Meanwhile, the Tigers had passed on hiring Beane to head their think tank, choosing instead the folks who would enable an American League record 119-loss season in 2003.) The only way MONEYBALL could be more perfect would be to subtitle it 'Cry of the Tigers.'",10,2,6,27 November 2011
Angels & Demons," 1st comment for DVD & Cable TV release: If you've invested your 10 bucks already, please skip
","Don't be fooled by the first couple hundred comments here; nearly all of them came from people who 1)were involved with the film, 2)are Dan Brown ditto-heads, and\or 3)spent about $10 to see this in a first-run theater and do not want to admit they shelled out so much to see such an insincerely manipulative movie. The purpose of my comment is to help you decide whether to 1)rent this the first week it's out for one night at $2.60, 2)wait until you can rent it for five nights for a buck, 3)wait until you can rent it for five nights, two-for-a-buck, 4)wait until you can see it for no extra charge from your TV provider(s), or 5)skip it altogether. (I will guarantee that those people who choose options #2 through #4--that is, who invest $1 or less in ANGELS & DEMONS, will be unlikely to rate this even as high as I did, at '5' out of 10.)I watched every excruciating minute of ANGELS & DEMONS' 2:18:27.26 running time (with my better half, on two free passes from the local radio station, for which we waited another hour). Ron Howard (I will NOT blame Dan Brown for this) violated several cardinal rules of movie making: 1)sure, you can have a surprise bad guy, but you CANNOT ASSUME every movie-watcher has read the novel, and stick in the twist nine minutes from closing credits with NO foreshadowing, thereby capriciously negating the hero-building mood you worked so hard to establish for the first two hours of your film, 2)you cannot stuff more wrong-headed incidents of people simultaneously displaying I.Q. disparities of 10 and 200 (that is, people being geniuses at placing themselves as totally secure evil masterminds while at the exact same time lacking even an insect's sense of basic self-preservation) than all seven seasons of the TV show '24' combined, and 3)if you're going to vandalize the characters of your lead actors as well as a good portion of the world's intellectual and art treasures, you cannot do it in such a casual, throw-away manner (unless you're making a farce such as MARS ATTACKS!).",5,0,3,19 May 2009
The Hangover," The Hangover versus The Magnificent Seven
","THE HANGOVER and THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN are the two most recent feature movies I've seen. There are several significant points of comparison. Firstly, according to this site--IMDb--HANGOVER is the 126th most popular film of all time, while M7 does not make the top 250 as of June 10, 2009 (even though M7 is popular enough to be selected the second most often for presentation on television by network executives the past four decades). Secondly, film studio execs marketed 1960's M7 primarily as a 'western,' while this summer's HANGOVER is billed mostly as a 'comedy.' However, Steve McQueen constantly tried various comic gambits to upstage Yul Brynner in M7, while HANGOVER's bachelor party crew looks east (from L.A.) toward Las Vegas' 'Sin City' reputation as the last vestige of the amoral 'wild west.' Thirdly, Charles Bronson is looking after three kids in peril throughout M7, while 75 per cent of the bachelor party quartet must take responsibility for a baby in peril during the first half of HANGOVER. Though there are many other eerie parallels between these two movies, I must fight against public opinion to express a preference for M7, with Elmer Bernstein's classic musical score providing a clear edge to the earlier flick in terms of likely staying power (though HANGOVER did better at the box office its initial week out, even adjusting M7's gross for inflation, thanks to the later movie's better marketing campaign).",7,1,3,10 June 2009
Casablanca," Holds its own against most Shakespeare plays
","Looking at the list or compilation here on IMDb of notable quotes from the film CASABLANCA, I was reminded of at least 28 sayings that have become part of the American lexicon or our shared cultural literacy in the nearly 7 decades since this movie's release (a time period similar to the one that Abraham Lincoln observed had elapsed between the Declaration of Independence and his own Gettysburg Address). The 30-odd plays attributed to William Shakespeare have some advantages over CASABLANCA in terms of grasping 'market share' in our collective mentality: namely, they've had six times as long to take root in our imaginative vocabulary, which consequently has yielded far more adaptations (think current release GNOMEO AND JULIET) than time has proffered to the script which earned screen writing Oscars for the Epstein twins. On the other hand, only serious Shakespeare scholars would be able to identify two dozen memorable turns of phrase from the entire body of the bard's work, and many of these professorial types probably would be stumped to repeat ANY bon mot from 10 or 20 of the lesser known plays (all of which necessarily suffer from archaic words or meanings caused by the passage of the centuries). As stated in the quote section here, some CASABLANCA trademarks ('Here's looking at you, kid') predate the movie, while other famous lines ('Play it again, Sam') have been 'edited' for conciseness in the public mind. Back in school, I learned enough about Shakespeare to know the exact same thing applies to most of his famous one-liners: he was primarily popularizing stories and sayings that predated the dramas performed under his brand. (Much of the foregoing also could be applied to biblical scholarship, but I will leave it to the next reviewer to extrapolate between CASABLANCA and comparative religion.)More likely than not, the works of Shakespeare will be much more obscure 100 years from now, while phrases and images from such movies as GONE WITH THE WIND and THE WIZARD OF OZ will be even more iconic then compared with now. But I have no doubt that CASABLANCA will remain right at the top in terms of defining how Americans think, speak, and remember a common lingo.",10,2,3,19 April 2011
Star Trek," Based on STAR TREK's storyline, here's a STAR TREK 2 synopsis:
","Gaila feels sorry for the Hulk, who survived his craft's destruction but was burned so horribly that he's lost all his chlorophyll. Sighing 'It's good to be green,' she dumps Captain Kirk to bear Nero's baby. To show the Enterprise clique harbors no ill will toward this star-crossed pair, Dr. Spock offers to deliver the child for just 10,000 sulus, half the going rate that Starfleet docs such as Bones normally charge. However, 17 parsecs later when Gaila comes to term, Spock Prime enters the delivery room in uncharacteristic hysterics, screaming 'I don' know nuthin' 'bout birthin' no babies!' Fortunately, at this juncture, Kirk Prime enters the room, dressed in his scrubs, admitting 'I don't know much more than HE does, but I DID stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night!' Totally exasperated, Gaila gets off the delivery table, opting for a water birth in Shamu's tank on Water Deck Eight. Cradling his tiny ogre for the first time minutes later, Nero is so overwhelmed he hails a shuttle back to Vulcan Prime and injects 40 ounces of Red Bull to permanently inoculate the planet against his future fatal flubber foray.",8,2,8,11 May 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Funner than VALKYRIE; sexier than DEFIANCE
","Remake, schmeemake, if BASTERDS director Quentin Tarantino is redoing any WWII flick, it is Robert Aldrich's 1967 opus, THE DIRTY DOZEN. Not only are the climactic scenes of these two films virtually identical, but the tongue-in-cheek tone they share is seldom seen in such other recent revisionist WWII movies as SCHINDLER'S LIST (=the 'good' mature German), THE BOY IN STRIPED PAJAMAS (=the 'good' immature German), VALKYRIE (the 'fragging' German), or DEFIANCE (the 'fighting' Jews). Tarantino's idea of someone like the Detroit Tigers' WWII era superstar 'Hammering Hank' Greenberg, who still holds the major league record for home runs in one season by a Jewish player (58), directing his Louisville slugger skills against the skulls of Nazi storm trooper officers is a flight of fancy reaching the level of poetic justice. The notion that everyone is expendable in a war movie has not been exemplified so well since THE DIRTY DOZEN, either. People who study both of these films will find many other parallels that spell, if not plagiarism, at least outright homage.",9,1,9,22 August 2009
Public Enemies," J. Edgar Hoover was willing to liquidate the Midwest to 'get' Dillinger
","J. Edgar Hoover (played by Billy Crudup in PUBLIC ENEMIES) was the John Ashcroft of his time, willing to tear up the U.S. Constitution at the drop of a hat to satisfy his personal whims and prejudices. ENEMIES writer\director Michael Mann makes this clear in his film, based on Bryan Burrough's book of the same name. This movie is not for the faint of heart, or J. Edgar fans. Here's the basic story line (SPOILERS): Hoover's machine-gun slinging 'G-men,' working initially outside their jurisdiction, took an exceptional dislike to Dillinger (Johnny Depp), whom the public perceived as someone who was spreading the ill-gotten loot from voracious banks among ordinary folks during the depths of the Great Depression in the American Midwest. Because Hoover had declared Dillinger as the country's first official 'public enemy #1' in a failed PR move to milk more money from Congress, Dillinger sent J. Edgar a courtesy Christmas card in December, 1933. Hoover responded by having all known men, women and children connected to Dillinger tortured for 'leads,' which he followed up by sending an army of FBI special agents to a Wisconsin vacation resort, where they machine-gunned to death three young workers on break from President Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps, while letting Dillinger slip through their fingers. Unperturbed by this 'collateral damage,' the G-men quickly ambushed their #1 target again in front of a crowded Chicago movie theater, putting three bullets in his back and two bullets into the backs of women happening by. Of course, the movie does not reveal Hoover for the cross-dressing eccentric he was, a 'bachelor' employing his life-long male companion in one of the highest-paid FBI positions, or that there are reams of proof that Hoover personally blackmailed six U.S. presidents, and that he devoted even more resources to destroying Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., than he did to doing in Dillinger, because these are beyond the scope of Michael Mann's expose. But the fact that Hoover was REWARDED, rather than fired, for his reckless lynching of his self-proclaimed 'public enemy #1' insured a level of vicious mob-rule mentality at the highest levels of the U.S. government for 38 years beyond John Herbert Dillinger's public assassination July 22, 1934.The only criticism to be made of Mann's movie is that it is too 'fair and balanced.' While Hoover clearly is portrayed as the man 'pulling the strings' behind the scenes, FBI special agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) has his real-life role in the Dillinger case inflated, with the help of numerous anachronisms (some of which are detailed here in the 'Goofs' section), making it look like Purvis 'got' Dillinger virtually single-handed, as opposed to a corrupt Jabba-the-Hutt type venal bureaucrat wreaking havoc indiscriminately against Midwest civilians like some Captain Ahab run amok, all in a drive for his own personal glory. And, of course, being a Hollywood movie, Dillinger's relationship with Evelyn 'Billie' Frechette (Marion Cotillard) becomes one of the greatest love stories of all time in PUBLIC ENEMIES, whereas the real life bank robber reputedly had a 'special gift,' which makes one lady hogging him for herself a ludicrous proposition.",9,5,8,3 July 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Lots of action . . . but what's this about ORIGINS?
","I would prefer to see 10,000 movies and read 10 comic books, as opposed to reading 10,000 comics and watching a dozen flicks. Apparently some people have enough time on their hands to handle 10,000 titles in both formats (perhaps they were born in 1837, like Wolverine). So, after seeing X-Men #1-3, I was hoping #4--given its title and all--would do a more complete job of explaining exactly HOW all these mutants came to exist (you know, like the Marlon Brando cameo as SUPERMAN's father). However, after a quick and confusing scene in which an elementary school-aged boy kills a man who may or may not be his father, we're exposed to a hectic war montage in which this boy grows up to turn back Pickett's Charge during the American Civil War, back up Sgt. York in the trenches of WWI, land on Normandy Beach in WWII, and waste some VC in Vietnam. He does all this with his slightly older brother, who inexplicably sports a different surname (Creed, not Logan). I do not care if all these questions are answered in BING issue 687, BANG issue 1361, and BOOM, issue 26943D. Other movies based on comics have nearly always done a better job of exposition for non-fanboys than this flick (without billing themselves as primers on the brand, to boot!). About the only thing really clear in WOLVERINE is that the brothers had to leave their native Canada in order to slake their thirst for blood.",7,4,8,4 May 2009
Terminator Salvation," Don't try to figure out the rules for this alternate reality
","For special effects fans, this edition of TERMINATOR looks pretty cool on a big screen. For action movie buffs, there certainly is enough killing, sneaking around, and being chased to satisfy all but the shortest attention spans. However, for devotees of serious science fiction, SALVATION is no BLADE RUNNER. In this latest franchise offering, the machines seem pretty dominant (just as the zombies had become by the time DAY OF THE DEAD was released in that franchise). The only explanation offered as to why some of the few remaining humans are imprisoned rather than being killed instantly is that these captives are needed by the machines to better engineers their genocidal final-solution mechanisms. Meanwhile, wildlife is even scarcer in this alternate reality than surviving humans, indicating the machines have no interest in preserving bioforms on planet Earth. Given that attitude, what keeps the machines from using one of the 93+ readily available environmental contaminants capable of quickly wiping out life on earth without damaging any of their own components? To them, this should be just as much of a no-brainer as one of us using Weed-Be-Gone in our front yard. If the machines aren't smart enough to come up with such a simple tactic on their own, it is totally implausible that they've had as much success against humans as this movie series suggests.Where would I like the TERMINATOR series to go? Well, PLANET OF THE APES would be a neat concept, were it not for all of the people running around in tacky ape suits. One movie that successfully (if briefly) portrayed dominated humans was SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, in which Billy Pilgrim spends part of his time in a zoo cage for the amusement of his alien captors. FIDO had the novel idea of presenting collar-controlled zombies as robotic conveniences for the triumphant human race. Why can't someone make a movie in which the zombies curb their appetites, and enslave the surviving humans, or a TERMINATOR movie in which the machines control humans for their own benefit, instead of mindlessly slaughtering them?",7,5,9,2 June 2009
Knowing," Ambrose Bierce Will Know KNOWING's No Good
","Okay, Ambrose, I was going to give this a '1' rating (out of 10), but I gave it five bonus points for the classical music excerpts included in the otherwise overbearing score (two points for each of the uses of the saddest-music-in-the-world--used so much more effectively in Tarsem Singh's 2006 masterpiece, THE FALL--aka Movement II Allegretto from Beethoven's 7th Symphony in A Major, Opus 92=4 points, and one point for a piece after your time, the Jupiter Movement from Gustav Holst's Planets suite). It seems like Nicolas Cage (portraying M.I.T. astrophysicist John Koestler here) has done about eight similar I-try-to-save-the-world flicks in the past five years, and he's surprised everyone by being even lamer at this than Kevin Costner used to be. The only reason Bierce would want to see this is for the special effects rendering of the Prophet Ezekiel's wheels-within-wheels UFO. But will someone who has been in the deep freeze for 136 years really want to sit through two hours of absolutely meaningless melodrama (c'mon, wouldn't the benevolent aliens have something better to do for 50 years than to whisper into the ears of doomed people and make them scribble endless strings of numbers, from which NO GOOD COULD COME, even with John Koestler's totally implausible deciphering trick?) for five minutes of Armageddon? I'm sure Ambrose will lose NOTHING by simply tivoing to the good part, if tivo and KNOWING are around in 40 years. (And didn't director Alex Proyas realize people would find it cheap the way he stole the Tree of Life from the much better 2006 Darren Aronofsky film, THE FOUNTAIN?)TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: The body of noted American author (An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge) Ambrose Bierce, born June 24, 1842, recently was discovered in total cryogenic hibernation at the back of a Central American warehouse.

Gone with the Wind," Ambrose Bierce Is Lucky He Has No Grave in Which to Turn Over
","Sure, I give this flick a rating of '10' out of 10, if for nothing else, its place in film history (and legend). However, I will be amazed if Ambrose can make it to the intermission (and not just because a century plus of deep-freezing might shorten the attention span; I'm sure he'll do okay with TITANIC). I agree with Mark Twain that Sir Walter Scott made the Civil War possible, and GONE WITH THE WIND is the kind of romantic propaganda that cemented the South's 'military tradition,' making it possible for any madman to pick a random spot on the globe (Iraq) and 'Remember the Alamo' by slaughtering anything that moves. (By the by, the 'defenders' of the Alamo died in an attempt to KEEP THEIR SLAVES, as Mexico had made slavery ILLEGAL!) Bierce was seriously wounded in June 1864 in the March to the Sea; the last thing he will want to see is the losers depicted as the 'good guys,' especially since they've become the winners in the past 50 years, while remaining the 'bad guys' as much as ever!TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: The body of noted American author (An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge) Ambrose Bierce, born June 24, 1842, recently was discovered in total cryogenic hibernation at the back of a Central American warehouse.

District 9," Provocative movie has something for almost everyone
","I just saw an advance screening for DISTRICT 9 with some others from my book club. Half of the 300 people attending were still buzzing about this film-goers' delight when the lights came up after closing credits. Some said its setting in South Africa's Soweto slums reminded them of CITY OF GOD. Others said its mockumentary style was reminiscent of CLOVERFIELD. Someone said it ranks up there with THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (1951, of course) and ALIEN for sci-fi originality. Another fan said it reminded her of IMPOSTOR 'on steroids' (I looked this up, and it's an obscure 2001 flick starring Gary Sinise, in a moral dilemma similar to Wikus' in DISTRICT 9). At any rate, normally I don't award low-budget ($5 million) remakes of shorts with a '10' out of 10 rating, but I found DISTRICT 9 to be enough of an eye-opener to deserve a '10,' despite being more flawed than any other top-ranking movie I can think of at the moment. The key to enjoying DISTRICT 9 is to sit back, and not to nit-pick. It may lack the stars and special effects bazillions of TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN or STAR TREK: THE FUTURE BEGINS, but DISTRICT 9 will give most people more food for thought than either of those two earlier releases of this summer.",10,104,188,7 August 2009
Drag Me to Hell," Let's hope Sam Raimi teams up with Michael Moore in Michigan
","This film is a masterful exercise in wish fulfillment, as writer\director Sam Raimi makes sure a mercenary bank home mortgage loan officer gets exactly what the majority of Americans think such people collectively deserve. This movie could just as easily be titled THE ROAD TO HELL IS PAVED WITH GOOD INTENTIONS. Perhaps there are more kind-hearted mortgage loan functionaries than kind-hearted suicide bombers, but in America no one holds a gun to your head to force you to foreclose people's homes or turn down their cancer treatments on behalf of obscenely profitable health insurance companies. In DRAG ME TO HELL, bank employee Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) has made her bed, so the victimized gypsy woman's Lamia demon forces her to lie in it.Documentarian Michael Moore (FAHRENHEIT 9-11), a Michigan native like Sam Raimi, is shooting a movie right now about how the U.S. government allowed a handful of credit default swappers to steal the nest eggs of both the WWII 'Greatest Generation' and the Baby Boomers. The state of Michigan is twice as broke as California; Gov. Jennifer Granholm announced the inmates from 10 closed prisons will be released onto the streets shortly. Granholm also has imposed North America's biggest film-maker tax credits; several closed car assembly factories are being converted into sound stages; and I just read in Detroit METRO TIMES that workers are so desperate they're appearing in non-union productions FOR FREE. In Michigan, you never know what horrific, post-apocalyptic vision lies around the next corner. It's about time Raimi and Moore hook up to produce a thrilling docudrama within the cinematic paradise of their home state!",9,1,3,13 June 2009
Up," 'I have just met you and I love you'
","Talking dog Dug's greeting--'I have just met you and I love you'--to lonely widower Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) applies just as much to the world's reception for UP, if its current rating as the 151st most-loved movie of all time is any indication. UP tugs harder on the heart-strings during its first 10 minutes than any cartoon in history (for adult viewers, at least). Though this film may give pause to wise and\or precocious kids, such children should have no trouble adding this to their daily dose of doom and gloom. The opening chapter to this story parallels one of the best-loved baby boomer picture books, Virginia Lee Burton's 1942 THE LITTLE HOUSE. However, it uses Asner as a stand-in for actor Frank Morgan's gruff WIZARD OF OZ (1939), whisking an elderly city man rather than a Kansan girl to a cross between LAND OF THE LOST and the current TV show LOST (as in, will this whole bizarre episode turn out just to be Carl's post-traumatic-stress-induced dream, making him a geriatric version of Dorothy Gale?). Carl's chance companion for this trip, would-be boy camper Russell, shares enough of the spirit of young Carl in the movie's opening sequence to shade the rest of the film with a sense of deep irony. Though poignant and bittersweet, this cartoon is fresh, fun, and human enough to merit a projection of its future as a classic with staying power, along the lines of Bambi or Pinocchio.P.S.--This does NOT seem to be a cartoon that requires the 3-D premium price to get most of the enjoyment. We had free passes to see this in 3-D, but it appeared at least half to two-thirds of the film was virtually undistorted WITHOUT the glasses. So if you're bringing a lot of children and must choose between 2-D with refreshments or 3-D without, it's okay to go for the snacks!",10,0,2,1 June 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Transform this, IF you can!
","If my ears did not deceive me, about an hour into this marathon, one TV announcer says the on-going Decepticon attack is the worst terror event 'since 9-11,' and another replies that President Obama (real name of the current U.S. president actually used here) has gone into hiding in a 'bunker.' Why on earth would director Michael Bay want to imply that the 44th president is a craven coward, as the 43rd was accused of being when he actually DID hide in a bunker on 9-11? Is Bay suggesting that if the president of 2009 were WHITE, he'd attack the Decepticons personally, as Bill Pullman went after the aliens toward the end of INDEPENDENCE DAY, but since Obama is BLACK he would order his minions to boot the heroic Autobots off our planet, while adding insult to injury by sacrificing the hero of the first movie to the aircraft carrier sinkers?! If John Adams still were president and had such a slanderous smear launched against him by a member of the popular media, he'd slap Bay into prison for sedition. Hopefully, Obama will stick to his guns and precedent, and do the same to Bay, so that the rest of us can benefit from new direction for TRANSFORMERS 3!",6,3,9,1 July 2009
All Quiet on the Western Front," What this movie really proves
","Skimming through the top-rated comments on the WESTERN FRONT as of today, I noticed that several stepped outside the movie and proclaimed that IF the generation of young Germans represented by FRONT author Erich Maria Remarque had not been 'lost,' they would have prevented the Nazis from coming to power. Ahem. Remarque himself was not 'lost,' nor was the majority of his generation of German youth, however broadly or narrowly it is defined. A similar proportion of the counterpart generation in Great Britain was 'lost,' but the surviving majority helped weed out those trying to impose a Nazi-like fascism in the isles at the same time Hitler's band of misfits was taking power in Germany. The difference? FRONT played widely to large audiences in Britain, leading to such a pacific mood that the government took an attitude of appeasement toward Germany, no doubt prolonging the eventual WWII by years. On the other hand, one of the first moves of the incipient Nazi Party was to successfully suppress the showing of FRONT in Germany. Since their well of movie-going youth was not 'poisoned' with FRONT's anti-war message, these young men were easily bamboozled into believing in a thousand-year Reich, or Germanic Empire. Just acting in this movie turned lead Lew Ayres (who played protagonist Paul Baumer) into a pacifist, and he remained one even AFTER Pearl Harbor. The upshot of these facts seem clear: wars will NEVER prevent future wars; only anti-war movies can do that job. Therefore, the United Nations MUST adopt a program wherein the youth of EVERY nation are compelled to watch an anti-war film at least once a year. If that means wiring the deserts of the Sudan, the mountains of Afghanistan, and backwoods of Virginia for electricity, so be it. (On the other hand, all the warlords and defense contractors probably want to stay in business, so we can keep movies optional, and just end the charade that any country is seriously interested in 'world peace.')",10,1,3,14 July 2009
The Bridge on the River Kwai," 'This is war! This is not a game of cricket!'
","'This is war! This is not a game of cricket!' yells Japanese POW camp administrator Col. Saito to his British counterpart, Col. Nicholson, during an early scene in THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. In actual fact, noted British epic movie director David Lean (LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, DR. ZHIVAGO, RYAN'S DAUGHTER) turned one of the darker episodes of World War II, in which 12,000 Allied prisoners of war died while performing slave labor to build a bridge to aid the Japanese war effort, into something almost as buffoonish as the 1960s American TV show about a German POW camp, HOGAN'S HEROES. Normally I give winners of the Best Picture Oscar (which KWAI copped in 1957) a semi-automatic rating of '10,' which I had done here from memory of a first viewing years ago. However, upon seeing it again tonight, I realized the ending is so muddled (as in, who killed who?) that I had to revise my vote to a '9.' That, of course, is as a FICTIONAL story featuring psychology, action, suspense, and a killer soundtrack dominated by Kenneth Alford's 'Colonel Bogey March' from 1914. But as history, KWAI seems to merit a '6' at best.",9,0,1,10 July 2009
Sherlock Holmes," IRON MAN, without the radioactive chest gizmo
","The Robert Downey, Jr., version of Sherlock Holmes gives the Baker Street private investigator most of the fight stamina of comic book hero Iron Man, one of Downey's recent predecessor roles, without going through all the rigmarole of planting a nuclear-powered widget into Sherlock's chest. Holmes' frequent fight scenes serve primarily as a clever ploy by the multiple story and screenwriters to divert attention from a conspiracy theory plot which has more undercover bad guys involved than THE PELICAN BRIEF and V. combined. Ranging from jailers and hangmen to half the parliament and the American ambassador, the intersecting trilateral commissions no doubt have lizard people stashed somewhere in the background. The fact that the ritual murders staged as a red herring for the authorities needlessly involve top-level cabinet members as crime scene participants is the sort of thing movie-goers apparently are expected to overlook due to all the fisticuffs and explosions. However, the sets\art direction are in league with SEVEN, enhanced by seamless visual effects.

That Mel Brooks, in his directorial debut, could hang a very funny movie on this song (to which, despite not being able to read music, he wrote music and lyrics, actually dubbing 'Adolf's' baritone solo himself onto the soundtrack) is a testimony to Brooks' diabolical ability to get the 'last laugh' on the author of the 'final solution.' Hitler himself would be spinning in his grave--IF he had one! My summary quote from the film comes from the 'winner' of the 'worst script' contest run by producer Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) and accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) early in the story--namely, the Fuhrer-worshiping Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars). It might as well have been said by Brooks directly to his OWN producer, Joseph E. Levine, when the latter said SPRINGTIME FOR HlTLER would NEVER see the light of day!",9,0,1,4 July 2009
Ran," Colorful Asian warfare without ninjas-on-wire trickery
","Unlike director Ang Lee's 2000 film CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, or director Yimou Zhang's American wide releases earlier this century (HERO in 2002, HOUSE OF THE FLYING DAGGERS in 2004, and CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER in 2006), viewers of Akira Kurosawa's 1985 epic RAN not only are treated to period warfare much more colorful than equivalent movies in European settings, but also get a sense of realism (as in, these things actually could have happened on planet Earth) missing from the four more recent Asian martial dramas.Since it was not Kurosawa's original intention to remake KING LEAR, and since only a few of the touches (such as youngest son Saburo's shading of his 'sleeping' father's form in the opening scene, or the presence of Kyoami, a European-style court jester) are distinct 'borrowings' from Shakespeare's play, film fans with an antipathy toward the bard should not be put off by RAN being listed as an 'adaptation' of LEAR.Finally, if I were to compare a character from RAN with one from Shakespeare's opus, I would tend toward noting the similarity between the amoral ambitions of Lady Macbeth in the tragedy named for her hen-pecked husband to RAN's Lady Kaede (a brilliant Mieko Harada), who earns the fate of Macbeth himself with her no-holds-barred unquenchable thirst for revenge.",9,1,3,19 July 2009
The Ugly Truth," 'Tap-water is great!'
","If you want a clue as to who's going to end up with whom in THE UGLY TRUTH, listen for this line of dialog ('Tap-water is great!') and you shouldn't go wrong. What else do you need to know for deciding whether to see this movie? Well, one of the most important considerations for many (after the 'little surprises' tucked away in the recent American wide-release movies FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL, OBSERVE AND REPORT, and BRUNO, to name just three) is that there is NO MALE FRONTAL NUDITY here (flaccid or otherwise). Furthermore, though much of the plot revolves around sex and sex advice, the dialog can be described best as 'tastefully raunchy' or 'polite smut,' as compared to the total gross-outs aimed for by the Judd Apatow-Seth Rogen crowd. Therefore, if you and your date want something in the mainstream of modern sensibilities which is unlikely to leave you cringing, give this short but sweet romantic comedy a go.",8,2,9,27 July 2009
The Wizard of Oz," Ambrose Bierce Will Find the Devil in the Details
","While this is my favorite movie of all time primarily because I saw it on TV every year growing up (and could scare my little sister by humming the Witch's Theme any time it was cloudy outside), Ambrose will be seeing it for the first time with adult vision (as he was 97 years old when it premiered), so he will like OZ for reasons different from my initial reactions. L. Frank Baum's original OZ title was the last book Bierce read aloud to his grandchildren, prior to his ill-fated tie-in with Pancho Villa. I presume Baum's fantasy (primarily an anti-gold standard screed) will be fresh in Bierce's mind when he's fully thawed out. The author of THE DEVIL'S DICTIONARY will no doubt agree with me that this is a case where the movie is actually BETTER than the book (along the lines of Peter O'Toole's LORD JIM or William Hurt's recent TUCK EVERLASTING, which barely topped its outstanding youth novel). What he'll notice his first time through OZ (which did not dawn on me until college) is all the dark undertones of Emerald City. Even if unaware of Judy Garland's off-set torture by her foster dad Louie Mayer and his henchmen, Ambrose will be perceptive enough to see how the innocent children's tale is totally sexualized by shoe-horning a young woman with a duct-taped bosom into a role (Dorothy Gale) more appropriate for Shirley Temple. This subliminal perversity is what makes OZ the quintessential American film experience for any age--particularly Bierce's robust 207. He'll also get a special kick out of MGM's crass substitution of in-heat ruby red slippers for Baum's original silver footwear (which no doubt caused L.Frank to turn over in his grave, seeing as how this totally castrated his main purpose for writing OZ in the first place!).TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: The body of noted American author (An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge) Ambrose Bierce, born June 24, 1842, recently was discovered in total cryogenic hibernation at the back of a Central American warehouse. Bierce is expected to be fully defrosted by late 2049 or early 2050. Based on my 85 previously posted IMDb comments and background in Bierce studies, the author's guardians have commissioned me to review a periodically updated list of films to help guide his future leisure pursuits, with the provision that my comments also be made available to the general public.",10,1,3,22 March 2009
The Soloist," If you're deciding whether to watch RAY or THE SOLOIST . . .
","Obviously, the 2004 film biography of Ray Charles, titled simply RAY, has a lot to be said in its favor. After all, Jamie Foxx won the lead actor Oscar in 2005 for his performance in the title role. He is very unlikely to repeat that feat playing the title character in THE SOLOIST, because 1)the latter film was released too early in the year, 2)it only made $30 million in U.S. theatrical receipts, 3)it did not get as much publicity and 'buzz' as RAY, 4)Ray Charles was a pop music superstar with whom almost everyone is familiar, while the soloist Nathaniel Ayers is notable primarily for the mental illness which nipped his career as a classical instrumentalist in the bud, and 5)many movie-goers and Oscar voters prefer flashy over-the-top flicks (such as RAY) to quiet, understated films, such as THE SOLOIST. The reason I gave THE SOLOIST a rating of '10' out of 10 (compared to a '9' for RAY) is that in addition to portraying the torment suffered by the title character and his family (a main feature of RAY), the SOLOIST does such a great job of 1)showing how journalism works, 2)showing how open-ended fighting mental illness can be, and 3)showing how the homeless live, right down to filming actual homeless people in an actual shelter. Whereas RAY devotes much of its time to drug abuse and the glamorous life, THE SOLOIST--despite a few flaws--feels like a more helpful look at parts of society with which the average person is likely to come into personal contact (check out the panhandling musicians outside any U.S. major league sports venue when the temperature is over 50 degrees Fahrenheit), while RAY's milieu is too rarefied for most.",10,0,1,19 June 2009
