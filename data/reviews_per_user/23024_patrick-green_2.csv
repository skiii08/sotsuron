Sucker Punch," Vapid Rubbish
","Sucker Punch takes visual sophistication to its extreme and fails catastrophically. The weak plot is little more than a pretext to shove as many nonsensical CGI action scenes into the movie. One cannot help but think that Sucker Punch is a teenage video game addict's fantasy, with scantily clad women battling extraordinary beasts with big guns and swords.Sucker Punch's visuals quickly lose their charm too, as the confused spectator will begin to wonder if the onslaught of CGI and cliché action scenes have any actual purpose. To add insult to injury your ears will also be barraged by butchered cover versions of famous songs such as 'White Rabbit'.",1,5,13,4 January 2015
Shark Tale," Crappy hip-hop, r n' b fish flick, awful
","I happened to watch this film by accident with my younger brother one night whilst babysitting him. It turned out to be a crappy recycled version of Finding Nemo, which is a marvelous animation movie compared to this filth. The film is basically a propaganda movie for Rap and R n'B and all that whatnot. Those who made the movie probably thought hey! Lets dump some elements from Good Fellas and the Godfather in a mixer and then add some stuff from Finding Nemo and Shrek with some scummy music and press the button see what happens! Well, that idea sure has damaged some brains out there because people ENJOYED this piece of sh*t. Things I learned from this Movie: -Sharks are Mafiosos. -Slimy rock pool fish enjoy rap crap and all that sh**e. -Animated movies with fish in them have to encourage young brats to vandalise walls. -Renée Zellweger signed YET ANOTHER pact with the devil. -I hate Angelina Jolie for giving her voice to one of the characters in this chunk of diseased trash.",1,3,7,9 May 2006
