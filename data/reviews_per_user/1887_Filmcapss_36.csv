Ford v Ferrari," Amazing
",Incredible well made. Beautifully shot and and surprisingly emotional. Loved every second of it. Hope it does well in the awards season.,9,5,13,17 November 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Beauty and emotion
",Everything has already been said about this masterpiece. It's incredible in every aspect of filmmaking and Rodger Deakin's cinematography is just out of this world good. Without a doubt one of the most beautiful films ever made,10,3,15,1 March 2020
First Man," Space cinema
","Don't know what it is about space films. Interstellar, first man, 2001, they just give filmmakers the chance to tap into such deep emotions while also providing a sense of wonder. Incredible film. Technically and narratively.",9,0,0,23 December 2019
Captain Marvel," Meaningless
",This is the most disappointing movie ever. It feels like it was made by a robot and not real filmmakers. Brie Larson is terrible as captain marvel and the plot is generic and not original at all. Awful movie,1,331,626,3 May 2019
The Irishman," Masterpiece
","A melodramatic, Somber and last of its kind tale about the mafia. Unlike other brilliant Mafia/mob films that Scorcesse has made, this was different, instead of showing you the glamorous side of Mobsters, shows you a heartbreaking story about what that lifestyle leads to. With The master behind the camera and talents like De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci blessing the screen, I don't even need to comment on the performance and directing, it's all brilliant.
In the end a man sits in the end, alone, no one by his side during his final days, Thinking about what he did wrong, while Still of the Night plays in the background. Scorsese's presumably last mob film ends in a poetic and sentimental manner and I wouldn't want it in any other manner.",10,3,9,2 December 2019

Ready Player One," a love letter to fans of movies, video games and music
","Ready Player One, directed by Steven Spielberg is no doubt one of the most fun I can have with a movie. does it have flaws as a film? yes. but I can't help but overlook all that for all the references and all the Easter eggs that make me feel like a little kid again.",8,0,5,11 March 2019

Split," The acting.
","The movie's first two acts are great, thrilling and incredibly set up by M. night unfortunately it gets a bit convoluted at the end, BUT that's not what my review is about. It's about the acting in this film because good lord, James McAvoy delivers one of the best performances possibly ever. I don't see how anyone I could argue that. The sequence of him switching between personalities at the end is so brilliant, I was in awe the entire time, in and out of entirely different personas without actually changing his physical appearance is a incredible to witness on screen. I will never be able to get this performance out of my mind.",9,0,1,14 May 2019
Collateral," Collateral is one of the greatest crime dramas ever made
","'A Guy gets on the MTA here in L.A. and dies. Think anybody will notice?'A nearly flawless fast paced thriller/crime drama, layered with themes of ethical subjectivity and what a man and his dreams mean. Collateral takes you on a night time journey with two completely opposite characters. A Hitman played Brilliantly by Tom Cruise and A modest Taxi driver who lives his life hoping to one day accomplish his dreams played by Jamie Fox. Despite them being complete opposites you can't help but root for both of them as the audience. Collateral has some of the most amazing long sequences of two them just having a conversation about why both of them are the way they are. About what makes a man kill, about what makes a man so unwilling to act and accomplish his dream. (That part is quite easily my favorite part of the film)
There aren't many action scenes but when with the few that are present in the film are raw and adrenaline fueled, with some of the best sound design and gunshot 'sounds' you can't help but flinch every time a gun is fired.
Tom Cruise and Jamie Fox lead this crime drama and under the surface a story about nihilistic beliefs and the dissection of the human subconsciousness brilliantly. The only gripe i have with the film is the unnecessary vague ending leaving many questions left about Max (not in a good way)
Other than that, this brilliant, haunting neo noir is a must watch.",9,0,5,2 April 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Meh
","Not a full review cause I don't feel like doing one.Endgame was fine. It's riddled with far too many plot holes, cringy humor and weird character choices for me to give it anything over a 5. Hulk and Thor are completely butchered here as characters imo. The 2nd act is boring and does every time travel clichÃ© you could think of, third act however, although blatant fan service is fun and exciting to watch. 3rd act basically saves the movie. The main reason I saw this was to see how Captain America's arc ends since he is one of the few characters I care about in the mcu. Unfortunately Iron Man's arc is done way better here compared to Cap's. No spoilers but Captain America's ending is shoehorned in at the last second and makes no sense. It felt completely unnatural . Oh yeah and hulk dabs, in the year 2023.",1,19,33,29 April 2019
No Country for Old Men," Amazing
","Incredible film with great performances, even better directing and writing. It's pacing was a bit slow at times but hey, nothing is perfect.",9,0,0,30 May 2019
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Jeff Goldblum!!
",It has flaws and nothing will be as good as the original masterpiece but this has Dr. Ian Malcolm played by Jeff Goldblum as the lead which is literally one of the greatest characters ever created.,8,3,35,18 July 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Best of 2019 so far
","The 9th film by Quentin Tarantino
Once upon a time in Hollywood seems to be Tarantino's most mature, laid back and easy going film. And I mean maturity as in the maturity of Tarantino as a filmmaker. This is very different than every other film of his, it doesn't rely on shock value (until the end anyway), it doesn't have super hardcore violence for the most part, it also doesn't have high tension sequences that we've come to expect from Tarantino, but that's doesn't disappoint you because that high tension galore isn't needed here. It's a comedy about two friends. A fading actor and his stuntman in the aftermath of the golden age of cinema, trying to fit in, in a rapidly changing industry. What I love about this is Tarantino's love for filmmaking, films and the experience of going to the cinema is oozing in this. You can just tell he LOVES what he does and he LOVES going to the movies. The 'quirky' kind of tone, the witty, fantastic dialogue is all still there and it is top tier Tarantino. The performances from Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio are incredible, such great chemistry, they elevate the film in every scene they are together, Margot Robbie plays Sharon Tate beautifully. And she did a great job respectfully portraying an actress who was murdered tragically. My biggest gripe with the film is that Tarantino didn't use any of his signature high tension, downright uncomfortable sequences regarding the Manson cult. I would've liked to experiences that eeriness when he introduced us to the cult in the film, but he just brushed it off. Other than that the film is incredible artistic, stylized; the soundtrack is amazing, it works incredible well while cliff booth is driving around the night time in LA. It sets the mood perfectly. This is also gonna be one of, if not THE most rewatchable film Tarantino has ever made. Just great. I loved it so much, and I suspect I'll love it even more as time goes on. It's incredible Tarantino made a film with almost no structured narrative and you still come out of it thinking 'that was fantastic' ; the last shot of the film is so beautiful, and kind of sad if you read up on the Sharon Tate murder. I loved Tarantino's twist to what happened, it made me wish that only if that had what happened in real life :(",10,188,331,27 July 2019

",Rewatched and my rating went from 9 to 10. Incredible storytelling and spin on real life events. Slowly becoming t favorite Tarantino film.,10,14,24,17 January 2020
Drive," Atmospheric cinema
","Started and ended the film with Synthwave music playing, while Ryan Gosling drives through neon lit streets. How could you not give this a 10/10.Most films that incorporate love subplots in their crime dramas fall through. But it was so effortless here. There's hardly any dialogue for driver throughout and yet you can feel all emotions. Rage, love, sadness. The underlying moral dilemma for driver lies within each frame of the film, he never enjoys doing what he does, even if he succeeds in the task, which is just a brilliant way to structure a film and character that's clearly inspired by Taxi Driver. Simply, One of the greatest modern crime dramas ever made.",10,0,1,23 November 2019
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Beautiful
","' To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, draw closer, to find each other, and to feel. That is the purpose of life '
God I loved this so much, I daydream a lot so watching this felt so personal to me. Beautifully made film, Ben Stiller is a fantastic actor and an even better director, the cinematography and the soundtrack work so well together to give you this amazing feeling while watching Walter Mitty find happiness and fulfill his dreams. Just incredible.",9,2,3,13 May 2019

A Quiet Place," Best of 2018
",Wow. Such an amazing and thrilling film. John Krasinski is such an amazing new Director . Emily Blunt's acting in this is oscar worthy. Just wow. I'm so glad this movie was a huge critical and boxoffice success. Movies like this deserve it over the generic and mediocre marvel/Dc movies. Hope this wins oscars this year,10,0,3,20 October 2018
Ex Machina," Breathtaking
","A fascinating psychological thriller about AI, about its power and what it's creators responsibility is. Another 'AI' movie sounds derivative but when the idea the idea of sexuality and manipulation is introduced, Ex Machina becomes a special one. The breathtaking Cinematography and score work together to give an eerie/tension filled atmosphere throughout the entire film making you feel isolated, which I think is the movies biggest strong point, as soon you and (Caleb) are introduced to Nathan's beautiful yet haunting estate, you're hooked. The performances are all great but Oscar Isaac as the genius- billionaire, Nathan is a stand out; brilliant, raw performance that sticks with you.
Incredible achievement considering this is also a directorial debut. Definitely in my top 10 favorite films.",10,1,3,21 May 2019

Zombieland," Greatest zombie flick
",When I want to just have a good time while watching a film. This is ultimately what I watch over and over again. Zombieland is an iconic and classic Horror/Comedy.

Joker," Masterpiece with an important message
","Joker. Where do I even begin. Never expected a comic book movie to talk about such serious issues that we face today in the world. Mental illness, social economic disparity, social service funding being cut and how mental illness should be treated and what role we play in helping mentally ill people and how they're treated. The best part about Joker is that it never takes a position on these issues, all it does is show us what it's like and holds a mirror up. And that's it. It leaves so many things open ended for the audience to perceive. It's a dark, moody psychodrama which is elevated through Joaquin's performance, Lawrence sher's cinematography and Hildur guðnadóttir's haunting score. Tod Phillips also directed and wrote the film very well. The writing did drop in quality in some scenes during the third act which was one of my only flaws I had, but I'm not getting into spoilers. Watching Joker is a surreal, out of body experience. Some scenes for example the 'bathroom dance' is like being in a hypnotic trance where you don't even wanna blink while watching. And these are just my thoughts on the film, Either way, go watch joker. Support risky films like this that have something to say.",9,21,43,8 October 2019

Signs," One of my favorite Alien invasion movies
",The movie is really good. Amazing thrilling moments and horror elements here and there. I loved everyone's performance. Even the 2 little kids had surprisingly good enough performances. The build up to the invasion is fantastic. Some people might be disappointed because it doesn't really focus on the invasion as a whole. It just focuses on the family and the basement they are in for the entire 'invasion' some of the drama with the 2 kids dragged a little. The ending also seemed rushed and ... just not fulfilling enough I guess. Those are my only few negatives. Otherwise fantastic movie.,8,2,6,5 February 2019
The Sixth Sense," Mind is blown
",To say this movie blew my mind would be an understatement. I knew there was gonna be a twist .. but the movie still managed to catch me off guard. At the end. Amazing. What an amazing psychological thriller. I love it more each time I watch it. The movie drags a bit a lot of the times. Which is why I gave it a 9. But the ending makes it all worth it.,9,2,6,9 February 2019
