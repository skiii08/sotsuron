Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Empire has no clothes.
","Overall not a bad movie, but by no means great.  It suffers the curse of being the first chapter in a story of great things to come.  There are moments of brilliance throughout and Jake Lloyd (as Anakin) is not nearly as bad as everyone says he is.  Surprisingly, Lucas chose not to use a lot of foreshadowing on Lloyd's character.  I can see both sides of the coin in that Lucas couldn't just make an evil kid because then Kenobi wouldn't train him, but I do think there should have been at least a little foreshadowing to show that this kid may be destined for bad things.  Maybe in the next episode.  See it for the duel scene between Kenobi and Darth Maul if nothing else and do your best to ignore Jar Jar.",Null,0,1,21 May 1999
American Beauty," A brilliant movie.
","About once or twice a year I see a movie that sets off alarms in my head. This is one of those movies.  It's totally unique, strangely hilarious, and tenderly heartbreaking.  I will recommend this movie to anyone who believes film is no longer art.  Spacey outshines even himself in this masterpiece about the failing of a marriage and a man's misguided attempt at redemption on a wasted life.",Null,0,0,25 September 1999
Mission: Impossible II," A major disappointment
","What a tragic mistake for this franchise.  Mission:Impossible is supposed to be about a team of spy breaking into unbreakable places and stealing unstealable things with grace and style.  The first film was true to that legacy.  But this second installment is a travesty.  It bears no resemblance to the television series or first film, sans the theme song.  Cruise works alone without help.  And worst of all, the film is completely John Woo-ified.  Super slow-mo ad nauseum.  Overall, this film flat out stinks. Considering the talent involved (Robert Towne wrote the script) I expected much, much more.  2/10",Null,0,0,25 May 2000
