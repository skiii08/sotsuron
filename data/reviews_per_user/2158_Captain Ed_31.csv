Casablanca," Although commentary is unnecessary ...
","... I simply have to weigh in on what I think may be the greatest movie ever made.  There isn't one bad performance on screen here, and most are brilliant.  Rick, maybe the original anti-hero, played by Bogart at his best.  Claude Rains as the wisecracking, corrupt, and ultimately decent Vichy police captain.  Paul Henreid as Lazlo, urbane, quiet, and unflinching.  And of course, Ingrid Bergman, Ingrid Bergman, Ingrid Bergman.Two best scenes in the movie (getting goosebumps just remembering them): 'Le Marseillaise' in the club, and Louis tossing the bottle of Vichy water in the wastebasket.  The perfect movie if you want to see love, honor, and redemption, and you haven't already seen this, quit reading this review and go rent it.  Better yet, buy it.  You'll want it around.",10,0,0,22 June 2000
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Brilliant -- the best of Python
","From concept to execution, this qualifies as the best of the Python films. It features a solid plot structure and many hilarious and memorable set pieces, such as The Stoning, The PFJ vs the JPF, etc, that previous comments have specified.  There are still some slow spots, and a ridiculous interlude with an alien ship that almost screams that they needed to pad the movie out for length; these detract slightly from the overall product, but it's a worthy addition to your DVD or video collection.Interestingly, John Cleese said in an interview that the other Python members all consider Meaning of Life to be the best Python picture; Cleese picks this one.  I'd say that you should trust the funniest man in motion pictures on that score.",9,1,4,15 March 2002
Fight Club," Thought-provoking and inventive (possible spoilers)
","It's not often that a major motion picture can be described as above -- and Fight Club is all that and more.  It's a highly stylized look at the difficulty people have in connecting to the world around them.  The Narrator suffers from insomnia, but in reality he's been asleep his entire life, lullabied by consumerism and low expectations.  All that changes when he meets Tyler Durden and a borderline psychotic named Marla.While the violence is graphic, it is not the end-all and be-all of this movie, and to that extent the title does the movie a bit of a disservice. There are a lot of punches thrown and the screen violence is realistic, but there's very little of any other kind of violence until you get to the last twenty minutes or so.  What I find refreshing about it is that the consequences of the violence are shown realistically as well.*** SPOILERS AHEAD -- BE WARNED! ***The film is ultimately nihilistic, anti-materialistic, and anti-social; did anyone else note that the initials for Fight Club (FC) were the same used by Ted Kaczynski as the Unabomber in his manifestos?  Think of the Unabomber's philosophies and you'll get an idea where Durden is going with his plans.I will note that the twist at the end (and since 'The Usual Suspects', all films have to have an identity twist, don't they?) was telegraphed by the flash appearances of Durden in several early scenes.  This may be more apparent when viewing the DVD, as I did.  I noticed what I thought was a film flaw, backed up, and ran the scene one frame at a time.  This is used in several places in the film, and there's a notable one in the last few seconds, if you're into that kind of thing.  It's also set up well in the movie.An excellent film, somewhat undone by the clumsy handling of the twist, but the performances are first-rate.  A dark, funny, and nihilistic adventure for the brave.  9 out of 10.",9,0,1,13 January 2001
Elizabeth," Terrific piece of melodramatic fiction, gets Elizabeth wrong on almost all counts (spoilers)
","First off, I must say that 'Elizabeth' is very entertaining.  I own the DVD and have watched it several times.  The dialogue and the characterizations are done very well -- as long as it's understood that this is a complete work of fiction.Cate Blanchett does great work as Elizabeth I in what must be Bizarro World: this Elizabeth doesn't want power, refuses to go against her scruples and attend Catholic Mass on her sister's orders, gets played by the men around her, falls onto the throne almost accidentally, and (sort of) fires Cecil. She is betrayed by Lord Dudley and humiliated by an effeminate Duke of Anjou.  What a load of manure, although it is interesting to see that the British can butcher their history almost as badly as we Americans do ours (and theirs, too, for that matter).In reality, Elizabeth's true story is more compelling, in that she suffered no one to pull strings except her, unless it became mortally dangerous to do so.  Elizabeth had a marvelous political instinct, one borne out of sheer necessity, and one her sister never had.  She carefully acquired estates during both her brother's and sister's reigns, leveraging them to cement loyal support from powerful families.  She played a highly dangerous game with her sister, keeping her mollified just enough with showy attendance at Chapel Royal Mass and parrying Mary's attempt to marry her off later in Mary's reign to a Habsburg.  On the verge of losing her head for treason more than once, she showed a remarkable talent for prevarication and obfuscation, all the while preparing in real terms for her own rule as Queen.From the historical record, we know that Robert Dudley had been a serious suitor for Elizabeth, who at one point -- well after she was Queen -- had made it clear that she intended to marry him.  As shown in the movie, this scandalized the nobility, not because of some treason on Dudley's part, but just because there were already many rumors about their (supposedly) disreputable behavior together.  For political reasons, she scotched the courtship, but Dudley remained a close confidant at court.  Her romance with the Duke of Anjou came much later, when Elizabeth was in her late thirties or early forties, and she was as determined to marry Anjou as she once was to marry Dudley.  However, her Council was violently torn on the question, which infuriated Elizabeth, but as always she bowed to political reality and sent Anjou home with some lovely parting gifts.  And the part about Cecil is just remarkably silly.  Cecil was her life-long partner in ruling England, and while I'm sure their relationship had its ups and downs, there is no doubt that he was not only devoted to her, he was one of Elizabeth's main props for power.Anyway, apart from a few other minor issues, such as Mary Tudor's portrayal (think Snidely Whiplash, no subtlety whatsoever), the movie is pretty entertaining, a good costume drama.  It's just annoying that the film industry can't do research when they want to make historical movies.  Is there no responsibility for at least attempting some accuracy?  Or is it their intention to promote historical illiteracy?",7,4,5,22 January 2003
Finding Nemo," Hilarious and touching
","'Finding Nemo' is a whale of a tale (to borrow from the Disney song borrowed in this movie) about fathers and sons, friends and trust, and facing your fears.Beautifully illustrated and voiced, Finding Nemo is a movie that will delight audiences of all ages.  Ellen DeGeneres had the adults and kids rocking with laughter in one of the best sequences of the movie, and both DeGeneres and Albert Brooks were able to bring real warmth and emotion to the movie.  The storyline, which I will not go into, is written well enough that it never talks down to anyone and does not rely on worn-out clichÃ©s.As far as the animation goes, it is now undeniable that Pixar leads the pack for clarity, realism, and art.  If you doubt this, check out the reef sequences, or the fish tank sequences.  I could easily have lost myself in the sheer beauty of their animation.  A definite must-see while it's still in the theaters, and it's on my DVD wish list, too.",9,0,1,4 July 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Entertaining but not great
","First off, if you are a Star Wars fan (as I am), this is a satisfying installment in the serial.  There's plenty of action, although it mostly occurs at the end, and the storylines are well developed through some exposition which may feel tedious to some.  Let's face it -- Star Wars is never going to be mistaken for Wagner's Ring cycle, or even Lord of the Rings, and it's not supposed to be ... it's supposed to be fun, and Clones is, much more so than Phantom Menace.** SPOILERS AHEAD **That said, this movie has several obvious flaws, first and foremost the dialogue.  If Lucas wrote the dialogue himself, he should hire a writer, and if he didn't, he should fire a writer.  Most of the flaws will pass below your radar screen if you're really absorbed into the film, but some lines are so bad that you will roll your eyes.  Most disturbing to me are the lines for C3PO.  In other films, C3PO got laughs for the context in which he was speaking, a natural flow from his nervous character in stressful situations.  This time, he says things like 'What a drag,' which not only have no place in a galaxy far far away, but sound like an attempt to insert humor a la Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Blech.Ewan MacGregor is given some terrible dialogue as well but he handles it well enough that it isn't too jarring.  Speaking of jarring, we were promised that Jar Jar Binks and his unbelievable quasi-Jamaican-pidgin English would be greatly reduced, and it was, but not enough.Another flaw, and in my mind a completely avoidable one, was Anakin's character.  A problem for prequels is that we all know what will happen; the suspense is finding out why and how.  However, Hayden Christenson's Anakin was a jerk from minute one in this film and it undercuts any sympathy we have for him.  It also undercuts our faith in the Jedi, because if they can't see that Anakin is a bad seed, how the heck are they supposed to be powerful and wise?  Why didn't they wait until after Anakin's great tragedy (about 2/3rds of the way through) to have his resentment and arrogance break through to the surface?  It would have made a lot more sense than his unbridled petulance being almost completely ignored.  Anakin is so unlikeable you almost wish that someone would kick his butt and when it happens, you aren't unhappy about it.  Padme's attraction to him makes no sense; she'd be better suited for Obi-Wan.But there are plenty of good things too, especially Christopher Lee as Count Dooku/Darth Tyranous (subtle name!) and Temuera Morrison as Jengo Fett. Lee is always outstanding and natural as a villain; he's certainly capping his career with two plums, the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars cycles. Morrison is quietly malevolent, a brooding presence who is one of the few in the movie who knows how to underplay for effect.  The Yoda sequence at the end is a great payoff for the audience, and his unchaining from the limitations of puppetry is a huge boost to the story.  There is also a couple of lines set up by the subplot of the Trade Federation, where orders are given to 'shoot the Federation starships'.  You can't tell me that's a coincidence -- it's a funny shot at Star Trek, which not only preceded Lucas but in terms of cultural saturation still surpasses him.  The action -- when it occurs -- is outstanding, very gripping, again a nice payoff for the audience.Attack of the Clones is a worthwhile installment but doesn't come close to the level of Empire Strikes Back, the best episode in the series. Hopefully, Lucas will wrap up the prequels in a way that gets us back there. I can't wait to find out.",7,0,1,26 May 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," Entertaining, funny, a bit predictable
","I saw BJD last night with my wife, who has been asking about this film for weeks now.  I kept putting it off, thinking it to be another clunky, formulaic romance film.  I wasn't exactly incorrect, but the film is rather inventive in how it handles some conventional situations.Renee Zellweger did a fine job as Bridget Jones, although it's difficult to see why men would find her physically unattractive, even with the modest weight gain Zellweger had for the movie.  I thought she looked terrific. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth (one of my favorite underused actors) swap their normal roles around for this film, and both are outstanding.  Grant is the sophisticated, ethically challenged Lothario, Daniel Cleaves (nary a stutter!) while Firth's character seems almost unable to break outside of himself at all.  You can feel Mark Darcy's tension, his wanting to express himself and his despair at not being able to do so.  I'd say Firth's performance is easily the best in the film.Unfortunately, but not too importantly, the crucial plot twists in the story are pretty obvious to anyone with half a brain, especially the one concerning Cleaves and Darcy.  In the meantime, there's a lot of edgy humor in watching Jones bounce from disaster to disaster, trying to exceed her own abilities and in a few instances succeeding.  Some people have commented on her lack of moderation in drink, tobacco, and sex and how that made her unsympathetic.  That seems to me to be a somewhat sexist point of view, as many films feature male characters with the same exact issues, and these manage to garner sympathetic reviews.One last note: Previous reviews have mentioned 'Someone Like You' in comparison to BJD.  My thoughts were on 'Circle of Friends', which dealt with an overweight central female character trying to break free of her own expectations and those of the people around her.  While I really enjoyed BJD, and CoF doesn't have the same edgy humor, I think CoF does a much better job of handling the central conflict of both films and treats the characters better.  (Colin Firth is also in CoF, although he is in his traditional jerk character.)  When Bridget Jones' Diary comes out on DVD, my wife will be clamoring for a copy, and then we'll put both on the same night and have a film duel!",7,0,0,24 May 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Oh, my word, this is simply the greatest spectacle on film
","One film to rule them all, One film to find them, One film to bring them all, and in the theater bind them...**POSSIBLE SPOILERS (but if you've read the books, what the heck!) **Spectacular, abso-bloody-lutely spectacular.  An excellent cast and mind-boggling special effects thrust you into the center of Tolkien's first Lord of the Rings book.  The danger, evil, and heroism are not merely portrayed, they are palpable, surrounding you at all times.  The three hours will pass as but a few moments of the day to all but the most churlish, the least imbued with a sense of wonder.As a LOTR (and Tolkien) buff, I noticed several departures from the book, notable but not major.  First, Frodo is supposed to be quite a bit older than Sam, having reached his forties or so when his adventure begins; Pippin and Merry are younger, and Sam should be the youngest.  Frodo's manner of leaving the Shire is wrong; it was well planned and Pippin, Merry, and Sam secretly plan to go with him, not as chance as the movie shows.  However, all of that would have required a much longer first installment.  I don't believe the Riders come that close to Frodo before Bree in the book, either. The Council did not behave badly in the book, and of course much less time was spent on Saruman in the book as well.So what?  It works in the film, and the most important themes are beautifully drawn.  CGI usually gums up films, with a few exceptions, but here it is put to brilliant use.  The cave troll and the Balrog look as though they were filmed right alongside the actors in the scenes.  When Frodo puts the ring on, the imagery conveys the same sense I had when reading the books.  And the scenery!  New Zealand is displayed in beauty and splendor; more than once I wondered why this spectacular scenery isn't used in more films.I've only seen this film the one time, but you can be sure I'll be heading back -- very soon -- to see it again. Go see it ... film history is calling you.",10,0,0,19 December 2001
American Beauty," Good movie but not great (spoilers!)
","I bought this on DVD, having missed it in the theaters, because I wanted to have the best possible viewing experience.  I'm glad I bought it, and I'm glad I watched it, and I'll watch it again .... but this is not the masterpiece that the hype suggests.  It's far from being the sixth-best film of all time, no matter what IMDB reviewers say.Good things first, though: the performances of Spacey and to a lesser extent Bening were terrific.  Spacey is cementing his reputation for being one of the most versatile and compelling actors of his generation.  Bening's performance here is probably her best; normally, I would consider her a passable actress, but she is simply excellent in AB.  The supporting cast delivers solid or better performances.  Peter Gallagher was quite understated.  (But what the heck was Scott Bakula doing in such a throwaway role?)**** SPOILERS AHEAD *****While the dialogue and plot were well thought-out, I was somewhat annoyed by the standard Hollowwood archetypes and scapegoats.  The talent of Bening and Spacey avoided making their characters the now-standard emasculated hubby/castrating wife stereotypes, but didn't Spacey cover some of the same ground in 'The Ref'?  It seemed to me that The Ref's satire was more biting and more true than here in AB.Isn't it time to retire the abusive-military-guy-who-hates-gays-but-secretly-is-one cliche?  Chris Cooper is an excellent actor but even Olivier couldn't rise above this characterization.  He's a seething cauldron of hate, so guess who's the bad guy at the end of the movie?  I saw that one coming a mile away.  While we're at it, let's let the BRUNETTE be a bimbo for once and let the BLONDE have more than 5 working brain cells, okay?  And can we please, please, PLEASE get rid of the 'I'm brooding, so I must be deep and philosophical' characters.The problem with this very good film is that Hollowwood considers suburban family life to be its arch-enemy (along with the military), and AB's point of view is jaundiced by this and therefore lacks true substance.  I wound up thinking that although the movie was well-made and well-acted, I didn't know any of the people, except Spacey and Bening.  There was no resonance to any other characters.  The end result is that you feel deeply involved in the action, but the characters (and ultimately, therefore, the plot) seem contrived.I'd definitely recommend it for viewing.  If you feel suburbia is greatly peopled by the above stereotypes, you may have more appreciation for American Beauty than I did.",5,0,0,4 January 2001
The Patriot," Good entertainment, muddy history ** SOME SPOILERS **
","Having read some of the reviews after seeing the movie, I would say that both the movie and the reviewers are lacking in knowledge of the American Revolution and its tactics.  Does this mean you shouldn't enjoy The Patriot? Absolutely not.  But it does mean that you should read your history to inoculate yourself from its ignorance.The main character is a blend of two real-life South Carolina heroes, Francis Marion and Daniel Morgan.  Why the filmmakers couldn't just do a movie of Marion, known as the Swamp Fox, is beyond me.  The main antagonist, Colonel Tavington, is apparently supposed to be Banastre Tarleton, a rather obscure British commander whose name is still reviled in the South for his propensity to kill surrendering opponents, among other things.  However, as far as I can tell, he never torched a church, with or without civilians inside.  He often ran afoul of Marion's militia, who were extremely effective in disrupting British communications and were better organized and commanded than Gates' Continentals throughout most of the war.Mel Gibson, as the blended Marion-Morgan figure Benjamin Martin, is effective in the role of a family man pushed into war by the maltreatment of his family (which didn't occur with either Marion or Morgan).  Mel, please, can we find some other motivation than family members being maimed or killed?  I mean, haven't you pretty much beat that to death in Mad Max, Road Warrior, Lethal Weapon 1 & 2, and Braveheart?Heath Ledger follows up his good work in 10 Things I Hate About You with an excellent performance here as Martin's son Gabriel.  Chris Cooper is also excellent as a colonel in the Continentals and an old comrade-in-arms. Most of the rest of the cast are solid but not spectacular, and political correctness abounds.  The story gets pretty manipulative at points, but I felt the level of excellence from the featured performers overcomes this. It was very entertaining and I certainly felt it was worth my time (money wasn't an issue -- my son works for the cinema and gets me in for free!).However, I will warn my British friends that they will NOT like the portrayal of British characters in this film, nor will they appreciate the attribution to them of the very real Nazi atrocity of burning a church down crowded with civilians.The sad fact is that this unnecessary Hollywood muckraking will ruin this film's ultimate impact, especially since there are plenty of moving episodes in the American Revolution to build a real epic movie on.  History is hard to squeeze into a two-hour format, but making crap up only increases the difficulty.  When you set out to make a movie to remind Americans about the sacrifices our founding fathers endured to give us freedom, showering us with lies only serves to make us feel like fools for buying into it.One wonders why Gibson wants to keep making films about historical figures that mangle the history that makes them interesting.  One also wonders what project Gibson will take on next where he can fight brutal British tyranny. Unless he decides he wants to make Gandhi II -- He's Back and He's P***ed (apologies to Weird Al), this seems to be his last opportunity.",6,0,0,1 July 2000
Spider-Man," Really good comic-book adventure
","I've just some from the theater and I have to say, the movie had me pumped. Let's face it -- Superman may be well-nigh invincible, and Batman was richer than God, but Spidey was the superhero we all wished we could be.  Peter Parker was one of US.  That sense is well presented in the film; Tobey Maguire is excellent, and hopefully he will be reprising the role in the future.  In fact, there isn't a bad performance in the film.  Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst (with a bad dye job), and Cliff Robertson and the rest of the cast do a great job.** SPOILERS **However, there are some drawbacks.  This is most definitely a formula film; some of the reviewers mention the parallels to Superman, especially Cliff Robertson/Glenn Ford, but there are also parallels to Batman, such as the parent(s)' murder prompting the crime-fighting.  The problem is that we can all see these clichés coming a mile away.  When the movie tries new material, such as the wrestling match and his first costume (hilarious!), it works so much better.  Especially good was Spidey's realization that his spiteful inaction was directly responsible for a tragic event.  On the other hand, I don't know why every one of these films has to include at least one dark-alley butt kicking, and Spider-Man has more than one.  Can't we get one in a mall once in a while?  Or doesn't crime strike the suburbs?  At least this movie was shot in a real city, instead of a Tim Burton monstrosity -- a very nice touch, since Spidey was always more about reality than Batman or Superman.The special effects are great, and in fact may be a little TOO good.  Our hero begins to look and move more like a video game -- a really GOOD video game, but it still looks fake.  Other than that small quibble, the money they spent was well used.Overall, a great popcorn movie and it certainly will fulfill moviegoer's expectations.  Maybe this one will make enough money so that the sequel can do better at moving past the clichés.  My vote is an 8 out of ten.  Spidey rules!",8,0,0,8 May 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Cool and clever dialogue makes this a guilty pleasure
","Ocean's Eleven is never going to be mistaken for Shakespeare. However, its cool and clever dialogue and typical heist hijinks makes it a good popcorn movie, especially in light of its all-star cast.While there is some truth that at some points the cast gets so cool they almost seem asleep, for the most part they fulfill their primary purpose: to deliver their well-written quips and, basically, look good.  George Clooney and Brad Pitt are terrific at this, and Andy Garcia is both menacing and cool as the casino owner that the gang targets, for multiple reasons. Scott Caan and Casey Affleck are funny as ever-quarrelling brothers.  It is delightful to see Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner in meaty supporting roles; so often, Reiner only makes cameo appearances, and I can't remember the last time Gould was fully engaged in a role -- maybe American History X, and before that who knows?  Julia Roberts operates on autopilot as she isn't given much to do here, and the normally outstanding Don Cheadle affects an atrocious Cockney accent and utters the worst pseudo-cool lines:  'We're in Barney ... Barney.  Barney Rubble. TROUBLE!!'  Oh, please.  As for his voice, think Nicolas Cage in 'Peggy Sue Got Married', and you'll get an idea how annoying it is.All that aside, the movie starts out slowly but builds momentum throughout. Soderberg uses the camera stylishly (what else is new?) and gives the heist genre a new look.  Lastly, the score is terrific and matches up with the dialog and action, but never overpowers it.  Obviously, this is lightweight material, especially for Soderberg after 'Traffic' and 'Erin Brockovich', but give the man a break -- he's allowed to do something for pure fun occasionally.  That's what this movie is, pure popcorn-munching fun.  Are you in or out?  I'm in for an 8.",8,0,0,10 January 2003
Gone with the Wind," WAY WAY WAY Overrated
","This is nothing more than a four-hour soap opera focusing on the one character who couldn't be less likable if she tried.  There seems to be an obsession among romance writers about the antebellum South; this movie (and the book that spawned it) was no exception.The film itself would be just another Hollywood big-production weepie except for the treatment of African American characters.  Any who didn't kiss the Massa's rear end are portrayed as evil and dangerous (coveting Miss Scarlett and other Flowers of Southern Womanhood, naturally), and the others are portrayed as child-like and nearly helpless, with the exception of Mammy (Hattie McDaniel).  Here's a fun fact -- Klansmen are shown as good guys here!  It all adds up to one word: repulsive.  Yeah, I know it was made in 1939.  Guess what -- it's 2000 now.  We should be embarrassed by this flick,not celebrating it, just like Birth of a Nation (1915).I remember when Roots was on TV in 1976 and the Klan protested and asked for equal time.  This movie would provide it.",4,7,22,2 June 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The saga continues ... (some spoilers)
","So I got a co-worker to go with me on Opening Day (I had to take a half-day vacation) and we watched this amazing achievement in moviemaking.  I thought that this part of the Tolkien saga would be the most difficult to realize; there is an enormous amount of action and story to get through, and I was very afraid that the Ents would get too much of the 'warm and fuzzy' treatment, a la Ewoks.  I shouldn't have worried -- Jackson has outdone his first installment by a fair piece.The Fellowship has broken, and now the main characters have split up, leading to multiple story threads. Unlike the book, Jackson has chosen to portray this in 'real time', switching back and forth, but without making it seem choppy at all.  Truly, there are too many wonderful things about this movie to prattle on about; my favorite was the battle at Helm's Deep, one of the most powerful portrayals of war on screen in recent memory.  Watching the Ents go to war would be a close second.  Gollum/Smeagol is brilliant, a CGI creation voiced by Andy Serkis who may be the most heartbreaking character of all.Go see it.  Shame on those who gave this movie a 1 -- even if fantasy isn't your cup of tea, a true film enthusiast would still appreciate the craft and talent that this film displays.",10,0,0,19 December 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Stick with it, and you will be rewarded
","This is the type of movie that I am usually predisposed to dislike -- an overhyped production that starts off as a mess, which Moulin Rouge definitely does.  While the first 15 minutes of the film are almost unintelligible, they are visually stunning, and that was enough to keep me going.  After quite a while, the actual plot appears, and while it's hardly original, it provided a good framework upon which to hang all the rest of the weirdness that follows.An ensemble cast performs magnificently and that's the real attraction of Moulin Rouge.  Nicole Kidman redeems herself here as Santine, the courtesan with a heart of gold -- she's truly stunning, both as an actress and a vocalist.  Ewan MacGregor surprises me with his earnestness, vitality, and naivete as Christian, the young writer.  Jim Broadbent deserves his Oscar nomination as Zidler, the complicated proprietor of the Moulin Rouge.  On the other end of the spectrum, the Duke is played as Snidely Whiplash by Richard Roxbourgh with no shadings whatsoever, and John Leguizamo is just ridiculous as Toulouse-Lautrec, affecting both a poor French accent and a ludicrous lisp.However, the use of contemporary music (and mostly old pop songs) bothered me throughout the entire movie.  I don't believe that an original piece of music was presented until almost an hour had gone by.  Instead, we get several riffs on Elton John, the Beatles, the disco era -- 'Voulez-vous couchez avec moi'?  Come on.  It serves to pull this viewer out of the flow of the story.  I didn't really become absorbed until much later on, when the scenery stopped being so intrusive, the quick cuts and speed-up/slow-down effects subsided, and anachronistic songs gave way to some beautiful original work that actually had something to do with the story.  The choreography got pretty silly, too, especially toward the beginning.All in all, a visual feast and a belatedly engaging story combine with mostly brilliant performances to deliver a very entertaining film.  It's not my favorite, but I give it an 8.",8,3,4,3 March 2002
Rudy," What movies are supposed to do
","** SPOILERS INSIDE **This is an excellent example of what movies are supposed to do -- uplift and inspire.  Based on the true story of Daniel 'Rudy' Reuttiger, a short, thin, talent-challenged young man who defies the odds and his family to achieve his dream of playing Notre Dame football.  Along the way, he overcomes mild dyslexia to become the first member of his family to graduate from college.The performances are very good.  Sean Astin is not necessarily associated with great performances, but he aces this one.  One of the most moving scenes in the movie is when Rudy is finally accepted into Notre Dame.  Jon Favreau is great as D-Bob. Charles Dutton almost steals the movie as Fortune, the groundskeeper who looks after Rudy and gives him some final inspiration.The beauty of this movie is that Rudy doesn't become a football star or or win the big game -- he achieves his dreams in small ways, and he never stops believing it could happen.  Along the way, he receives help from many people, not one man against the world.  This recurrent theme reaches its zenith in the final scenes, where all of his teammates conspire to get him into the game.  Football is a team sport, and life is a team pursuit.  No man makes it by himself.And one last thing, for the guy who thought that this was just a 'two-hour propaganda film for Notre Dame': if that's all you got out of this movie, it's no big surprise that you're a Trojan fan.10 out of 10",10,2,2,16 June 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," One final comment ...
","One thing I forgot to add in my earlier post is a response to the many reviewers who advise four or five viewings to understand what Kubrick is trying to say.  This is an incredibly arrogant comment and shouldn't go unchallenged.First, as an avid movie-goer, I well understand that repeated viewings of a film will sometimes give different perspectives and meanings.  Cool Hand Luke is one such film, Edward Scissorhands another, On the Waterfront, Being There, and many, many others.  However, if a director makes his film SO obtuse that it takes more than two viewings to understand it (really, more than one), then the film fails.  The point of art is to communicate, not to needlessly play mind games.Second, I *did* get the message that Kubrick intended on sending, and I still feel the movie was pointless and boring.  That's due to some very lackluster directing and below-par acting, especially by Nicole Kidman. Having interminable long shots of empty rooms and hallways may be a hallmark of Kubrick's (I'd disagree with that), but if so, it doesn't work.  It drags the pace of the film down to a crawl.  So does Kubrick's idea of delivering 'important' dialogue: stretching the words out needlessly in a monotone. Small wonder this film came in at 2:45.  Watch The Green Mile, another multi-layered movie, and see how fast the three-hour runtime passes. 
I understand that some reviewers have an emotional attachment to Kubrick, and I also really enjoyed other of his works.  Take another viewing of Dr. Strangelove and A Clockwork Orange.  Sure, you can get different subtleties and symbolisms on multiple viewings, but the main themes are communicated clearly  on the first viewing.  Both movies also were well-paced, included excellent acting, and had much more interesting (and real) conflicts, taking real chances with the material, not the half-baked and phony issues which form the crux of this movie.  In this case, sadly, the Emperor has no clothes.",6,1,2,24 October 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," A yawner
","There's nothing terribly objectionable about EWS, except that it takes almost three hours out of your life and returns nothing.  Two words come to mind after two viewings: pointless and boring.Tom Cruise was pretty good in this role, but it didn't seem like much of a stretch for him.  He's playing an Everyman type.  Nicole Kidman, though, was terrible, and I'm beginning to doubt if she has any talent at all.  The overly long dancing scene featured her wildly overacting in Drunk Mode. (The actor she was paired up with was no great shakes either; talk about a lack of chemistry.)  The toke-up scene a few minutes later was even worse. Did Kubrick *require* actors to talk veeeerrrryyy ssslllooowwwlllyyy in a monotone when delivering lines?  The 'You men have no idea' line took about thirty seconds of screen time, and reminded me of the 'I AM in a world of s**t' line from Full Metal Jacket.  Kidman wasn't the only one saddled with this direction, which made the movie seem even more ponderous and self-important.**Some SPOILERS**The story line was unimpressive at best, and seemed stolen from the plots of a hundred soft-core semi-porn films.  Everything in it was a cheat.  Talk about a lack of commitment; no one ever follows through on anything.  Cruise picks up a hooker and doesn't do anything with her.  He goes to a sex party and avoids having sex, but he thinks about it a lot.  Even the crucial motivating factor for Cruise's character is nothing -- his wife was attracted to another man the previous year.  Nothing ever happened between the two of them, but supposedly it rocks Cruise's world. 
Two scenes at the end really spell it out better than anything else.  While you're led to believe that there's a vast conspiracy, Sidney Pollack tells Cruise it was all just a fantasy.  The key visual clue which tells you it may not be is immediately revealed, eliminating all suspense in the final climactic return home for Cruise.  You see the clue, completely aware of what it means, then have to sit through two or three minutes of Cruise walking through the house before he sees it himself.Let's not forget the extremely annoying toy-piano score.  It consists of someone using a single finger to hit the same seven-note run, over and over again throughout the movie.  Ugh.  It's supposed to indicate suspense, but all it does is set your teeth on edge.I know Kubrick is a god to some people, but this movie is NOTHING like 2001 or A Clockwork Orange, or even the first half of Full Metal Jacket.  It's a waste of money, time, and talent.  If it looks appealing to you, I'd suggest waiting until it's on the movie channels.  Don't waste any more money on it.",6,0,1,20 October 2000
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Clever and intriguing first step for a formidable franchise
","I have never read the Harry Potter books, a fact that appalls my daughter-in-law, who loves the novels.  I was not inclined to rush out to the movie theaters to catch this as I was much more interested in the Lord of the Rings movie.  One thing led to another and I finally caught it on HBO a year after its release.  I was very impressed with the film, although I still believe it to be meant for a younger audience.The acting is all top-notch, not easy to do with adolescent actors, but the cast delivers well.  Many fine British adult actors appear; in fact, I'd say that absent Ian McKellen and Judi Dench, you have the best of the lot here, including the (now) late Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, John Hurt, and a cameo by one of my all-time favorites, John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick!  Robbie Coltrane is Harry's mentor of sorts, Hagrid, and he is so good I kept forgetting it was Robbie Coltrane.  Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson were marvelous as Harry and Hermione; as the series goes on and the characters grow up, I think they will be even better.While the cinematography was superb, the script was a bit simplistic and obvious, but that's because it's aimed at young children, so it's completely forgivable.  The quidditch match is, I think, a great example of both the positives and the drawbacks.  I would expect future segments to be progressively darker and more complex, but the magic in this film is undeniable.  Now I think I'll go out and see the sequel at the cinema.  I give it an 8 out of 10.And by the way, to the stunning oafs that chortle with superior glee over the title change from Philosopher's Stone to Sorcerer's Stone for American release, you are all apparently too ignorant to know that (a) the book was titled 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' for its US release and the film was titled to match it, and (b) the word 'philosopher' has no occult submeaning in American English, which would have made the title rather weak. We hear 'philosopher' and think Socrates and Kant, not Merlin, and a 'philosopher's stone' therefore sounds like either an engraved tablet or a Aristotelian kidney problem. Americans and Brits have different jargon. Get over it.",Null,0,0,30 December 2002
The Untouchables," Overrated but entertaining
","I remember seeing this on its initial release and, while realizing that the entire movie was a piece of fiction, enjoying the film for its entertainment value.  Every time I see it, I can still see why.  However, I find it hard to understand how this film could be rated as one of the top 250 films of all time, seeing how 'Untouchables' has an insurmountable flaw at its center: Kevin Costner.There are certain roles that Costner can play, mostly because they seem tailored for his personality.  Roles like the one in Tin Cup, or Field of Dreams, or even No Way Out (a better film than this one) match up better. His Elliot Ness is treacly and unengaging, and Patricia Clarkson's June Cleaver performance doesn't help at all.  Costner's entire repertoire consists of furrowing his brow; the more intense the scene, the further it is furrowed, but nowhere does he ever project any true emotion. 
Even more unfortunately, Costner is paired off between two of the best actors of the time, Robert DeNiro and Sean Connery.  Connery gives the performance of his life here, winning a well-deserved Oscar, and DeNiro is simply DeNiro.  Even Charles Martin Smith gives a more energetic performance than Costner.  Brian DePalma outdoes himself, especially in the baby-carriage scene, but also in the overall lush look of the film.  That and the brilliant performances by DeNiro and Connery make this an entertaining film, but not a great one.",7,0,1,4 July 2003
It's a Wonderful Life," An all-time classic, darker than people think for its time
","(SPOILERS - but if you haven't seen this already ...)Before finally writing a commentary on one of my favorite films, I read through a few of the preceding comments, and I was surprised to see so many nay-sayers.  Their posts were far from the usual 'this film sucks' type of puerile commentary, however; it seems this film provokes intelligent discussion even from those who dislike it (or perhaps dislike the avalanche of affection it normally receives).I won't bother to recap the entire plot blow by blow. If you've seen it, you already know it, and if you haven't there are plenty of extensive recaps already in the User Comments section.  What works for me is Jimmy Stewart as Everyman, George Bailey.  Unless you are very fortunate, most people wake up and find out that they have given up their dreams as trade-offs for other things in their lives -- family, friends, etc.  Most of us are at peace with this.  However, it's very apparent that while George has put aside his disappointment, it lurks below the surface and is the vulnerable chink in his armor.  Potter (brilliantly portrayed by Lionel Barrymore) knows this and almost successfully exploits it; George stops himself just before agreeing to be bought by Potter after Potter promises him a substantial (for its time, an enormous) salary and travel opportunities.George, having had to put his own dreams on hold or away on at least three separate occasions now, prospers modestly and builds a family, and his disappointment stays below the surface until disaster strikes.  His unreliable Uncle Billy (Capra regular Thomas Mitchell) unknowingly hands Potter the bank deposit, literally putting the means for George's destruction in Potter's hands.  Potter informs the bank examiner and the DA about the $8000 shortage at the S&L, and George faces ruin and prison for embezzlement.  He tries asking Potter for help -- crawls for it, actually -- and Potter gleefully refuses.  George, while holding onto his low-equity whole-life policy, realizes that the policies make him worth more dead than alive and plans to commit suicide.  That's when an angel steps in and shows George what his world would have been like had he never been born.Some people think that George is owed something monetary by the townspeople, but actually George has prospered modestly by helping them prosper.  In terms of money, neither really owe each other anything.  In terms of friendship, George has been what Potter is financially -- as rich a man as any other.  But George, in his plight, doesn't see this.  All he sees is financial, legal, and social ruin because he's looking through Potter's eyes; Potter has succeeded (temporarily) in ruining him spiritually.  He even turns into a low-rent Potter on his initial return home, barking at his kids and his wife, smashing things, yelling at the schoolteacher, before righting himself somewhat and trying to apologize to his terrified family. He leaves for a bar, where his friends try to find out what's wrong, and he sends up a desperate prayer to God for help in one of the most heartbreaking scenes I've ever watched.  (And then he gets punched in the nose by the husband of the schoolteacher, in one of the most wry moments ever on screen.)The look at what Bedford Falls becomes without ever having a George Bailey isn't as important, although Potterville certainly is the inspiration for Back to the Future Part II's alternate Biff-run Hill Valley.  George comes back to reality with his soul and his faith restored, running through the restored Bedford Falls with joy while heading towards certain ruin.  His faith leads him back to his wife, who has been his support and his partner through all his setbacks.  Instead of ruin, his friends -- not his debtors -- have all heard that their friend is in serious trouble and have come to help.  Their faith in their friend George never wavered (they know he didn't steal anything), even if his faith in them failed, mirroring the faith that God has in each one of us even when we don't have faith in Him or in ourselves.  Even Sam Wainwright, from whom he 'stole' Mary, sends a line of credit that guarantees George will be saved.  His brother, a Medal of Honor winner who was to make a triumphant entrance the next day, instead comes back in time to say what George finally realizes: he is indeed the richest man in town.At its core, then, this movie isn't about Christmas, it's about faith: faith tested, faith failed, faith restored.  George loses faith in himself and God and his friends and family, and is shown why their faith in him won't completely fail.  In a way, this is really more of an Easter story -- Potter crucifies George, who becomes reborn.  In order to make this work, you have to see George lose his soul, as he does in those moments after he realizes the ruin that Billy has made of their lives, and that means George has to do some unsympathetic things.  A couple of the actions he takes at home borders on emotional abuse, which is why his wife asks him to leave.  In order for the film to work, he has to hit bottom, and Stewart masterfully portrays this.At the same time, Donna Reed had to play her role as even-keeled as possible, as dependable and rock-solid against Stewart's agonizing emotional swings, in order to both highlight Stewart's work and to symbolize God's support and faith.  Reed is absolutely amazing in this role, understating while not giving an inch to Stewart in their scenes together.  Mary is a real woman, not some straw-man symbol, and without that the film would have utterly failed.And what of Potter?  Why does Potter get away with the money?  In a standard morality play, Potter would get caught and wind up ruined, but this film isn't a standard morality play.  Potter exemplifies the Scriptural warning, 'What does it profit a man to gain the world but lose his soul?'  Potter, by taking and keeping the money and later turning George in, has lost his chance for redemption.  He is dead already and nothing on Earth can save him but himself.  However, this is not a blanket indictment of all who have money, as Sam Wainwright gladly steps in to save his friend -- and Sam is certainly the nouveau-riche type of person that is easy to dislike in standard morality plays.  Potter represents himself and the greedy avarice that has consumed him.When watching this film at any time of year, we are reminded that while events can cause us to lose faith in God and in ourselves, we can still hope that those around us do not lose their faith in us.  We are not defined by how much or how little money we have; our goodness comes through in how we treat others and how we all help along the way.  All the money in the world cannot save us from death, but God (and our friends) can save us from spiritual death in times of crisis.  That's why this is one of the greatest movies ever made and why it belongs in the top 10 of anyone's movie list.",10,6,12,9 January 2003
A Hard Day's Night," Probably the best juke-box movie ever made
","'A Hard Day's Night' was the Beatles' first, and probably best, feature film of their career.  Unlike the confused and confusing 'Help!' or the incredibly simplistic and message-oriented 'Yellow Submarine' -- in which the Beatles only appeared briefly -- this film has sharp editing, good supporting characterization, and the good sense not to rely too much on the Beatles themselves for more than some good quips and great music. 
Richard Lester's compelling and innovative cinematography and editing underscores the fact that these four young Liverpool lads are going to change the world, well before they actually had begun to do so.  Rather than making a throwaway flick for the fans, Lester crafted a minor masterpiece for rock and roll movies that has never been equalled or even attempted. (The best musician-based movie is still The Buddy Holly Story, but that was a biography and really a different genre.)  The Beatles exploit their public personas to the max here -- loverboy Paul, sardonic John, quiet and naive George, and cuddly Ringo.  Wilfrid Brambell steals the show to the extent possible as Paul's grandfather, 'a real mixer' as Paul says, who seems to delight in starting fights and causing trouble.  The movie does get slow at points, and except when the Beatles are performing, the movie is surprisingly lacking of a score.  The DVD transfer I watched is terrific and the remix of the songs is especially good.  This movie is definitely worth a watch to see the Fab Four on the upward arc of their careers and Swinging London at its height.  Cool Britannia has nothing on this.",8,1,1,30 December 2002
The Green Mile," One of the best movies I've seen in a while
","The Green Mile is an outstanding movie, one that leaves you with a bittersweet feeling that moves more toward the bitter in a courageous manner.  The performances are powerful, without exception.  Some of the actors in the movie are usually used as heavies in other films, especially David Morse, but are played against type to great effect.  In fact, almost everyone in this movie is a well-known actor from featured roles in the past.  Harry Dean Stanton is as excellent as he ever is in a small, comedic role as the exceution stand-in.  I felt that Sam Rockwell (hilarious as Crewman #6 in Galaxy Quest) was outstanding as Wild Bill, a psychotic who provides both comedy and stark evil.  Hanks provides his usual wonderful, understated performance.  But Michael Clarke Duncan is a revelation.  For a man as massive as he is, he moves with a gentle grace, and for a man whose career has just started to take off, he steals the focus in every scene. Pretty darn difficult to do with these actors, and to their credit, they don't fight it -- they allow Duncan to be the focus.The story?  Well, the movie uses a framing/flashback technique to allow us to go back in time to the Depression and a Louisiana death row.  Almost all of the film takes place in a confined, brown, depressing corridor with green Linoleum and caged men on both sides.  The main story starts out when John Coffey (Duncan) is brought into the Mile, convicted of raping and murdering two little girls (and can you remember what Bruce Willis movie the father was in??).  The guards, gentlemen all with one exception, begin to sense that there's something very unusual about John.The interplay between the guards and the inmates serve to remind us that there's humanity on both sides, and the two antagonists  (one guard, one inmate) seem to be an allegory for the dehumanization that's occurred on both sides in modern times.  Make no mistake, this movie is anti-death penalty, but its points are made in measured tones, with respect to both sides (I believe).  It is no diatribe.The final scenes are so simple and powerful that they brought tears to my eyes and have haunted me for days.  This is definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time.  If possible, watch it on DVD for the best effect.",10,0,1,24 October 2000
Bring It On," A movie made by committee
","Here we have a great example of what happens when you let a committee determine how a film is to be made -- you wind up with a confused, contradictory, boring mess.Not that BIO lacked potential; it had the potential to be several different kinds of movies.  It could have been a hilarious satire on the rah-rah spirit behind the odd concept that cheerleading is a sport in itself, and there were flashes of this at times.  It could have been a serious movie about the effort and dedication it takes to become the best at something, and there were more than a few flashes of that.  It could have also been a 'Rocky' or 'Karate Kid' type movie where the underdog fights against all odds to come out on top, and it seems that was what the filmmakers were aiming for, but they picked the wrong characters for the leads for us to root for that.  Lastly, it could have been an excellent opportunity to show how black (and to a lesser extent, Hispanic) culture is stolen and exploited by the mainstream white culture.  They use it merely as a plot point and never explore it after that, almost exploitave itself if one thinks about it.So what we get is hints of all of these and no follow-through on any consistent theme.  The first thirty minutes of the film has several satirical gags about the cheerleaders but then insists that we take them seriously later on.  Hey, if you start off poking fun at them, we're not going to give a damn about them after that.  In fact, I spent the entire movie trying to see whether we should be rooting for the central characters or their rivals.The acting isn't bad and the cheer routines are done well.  They may be the most entertaining part of the entire movie.  There are several laughs, mostly in the first part of the movie.  After that it gets dull and plodding.  You never get to know any of the secondary characters at all, which wouldn't be a problem in a satire but is a problem when the movie starts taking itself seriously.I gave it a 5, a seriously mediocre movie, and the sad part is that it had the potential to be so much better if someone would have decided what the hell they wanted to do.",5,1,2,3 September 2000
Any Given Sunday," Boring, annoying, and pretentious (SPOILERS!)
","This is almost like shooting ducks in a barrel.  This football movie was made by people who don't know or understand football, and it shows.The plot -- what there is of it -- is taken from Sports Film 101: struggling team with internal dissension, aging star/hip new rookie, coach past his prime trying to reach back for just one more win, blah blah blah.  Guess who wins the big game at the end of the film?  And since this is an Oliver Stone film, it tries to be cutting edge and revelatory by showing that athletes (gasp) sometimes abuse chemicals to play!  Sometimes they use bad language too, and one or two of them treat women badly.  What a shocker.  I guess no one involved with AGS ever saw North Dallas Forty, a truly seminal film about professional sports.  Getting past the trite plots and subplots, the direction of this film was bizarre.  Stone has made the longest music video in history.  Every scene -- and I mean EVERY scene -- is jarringly presenting in quick cuts and odd camera angles.  Most of the movie uses overlays of old game films and pictures of old football players.  There are frequent times when the pictures go out of focus and the colors mutate -- I can't describe it any better than that.  The effect of all this film-school technique is for Stone to shout at you, 'LOOK AT ME!! I'M AN IMPORTANT DIRECTOR!!'  This film scales the heights of pretentiousness and self-indulgence.The direction is not the only technical aspect that's botched.  At times, the sound editing is so bad that I had to turn on the subtitles in order to understand the dialog.  (I was watching the movie on DVD with a brand-new surround-sound system.)  At times, the audio sync seemed off.  And the uniforms were atrocious, especially those of the Dallas Knights.  I've seen better uniforms on high-school teams.The acting?  Well, Pacino was okay, but he was terribly mis-cast in this role.  What normal human being looks at Pacino and says, 'Football coach'? Lela Rochon (who went to my high school) is the ONLY sympathetic woman in this movie, and I suspect that's because her character held no power.  All of the other women in this film come across as castrating bitches, especially an unintentionally hilarious performance by Lauren Holly. Ann-Margret was treated a little more kindly, but she was drunk throughout the entire movie.  Cameron Diaz got to play the Delta Burke role from HBO's 'First and Ten', which aired about fifteen years ago.  Jamie Foxx isn't bad but his character is ridiculous and his character's elevation to star status is completely unbelievable.  I will agree with one previous reviewer about Lawrence Taylor -- he's great in this film, as is Jim Brown.  James Woods is wasted in a stupid subplot that is so totally undeveloped and yet so trite that you're glad to see him go at about the two-hour mark.It's become clear that Stone is increasingly incapable of producing a coherent film, and you have to wonder why he keeps getting financing. Probably because the sheep flock to his movies and convince themselves ex post facto of his supposed brilliance.  This movie is a waste of time.  Even the pedestrian 'Replacements' is more entertaining than this.",3,0,0,16 January 2001
Speed," Some brain-dead spots, but exciting **SPOILERS**
","'Speed' features some exciting action and good acting, but it also features some scenery-chewing and script idiocy.  However, it's a good enough popcorn movie to entertain, as long as you know it's not terribly smart.First, the good: Sandra Bullock had a breakthrough role in this film and it's easy to see why.  Despite the testosterone overload of films in this genre, she comes across as both strong and vulnerable.  In fact, she's the one person in this movie besides Jeff Daniels that feels genuine and so the audience (male & female) can easily identify with her.  She does brave things but always because she has to do them, not because she's an idiot who wants to prove something.  Kudos to the writers and to Bullock, who glows onscreen here.Speaking of idiots proving something, Keanu Reeves and Dennis Hopper fall into that category.  Reeves lets it lay back, though, and that works more than Hopper's typical Snidely Whiplash-style villain, who at one point starts spewing a bunch of pseudo-philosophical nonsense about how the PD won't let the bomb 'become'.  Smack the writers and Hopper, and give Keanu credit for trying to overcome the material.The plot is laid out pretty well most of the way through, except for two glaring 'you've gotta be kidding me' moments.  First, at one point the PD direct the bus -- which has to stay above 50 MPH -- onto the 105 freeway, which at the time had not opened yet, and then they're surprised when there's a section that hasn't been built.  Second, anyone familiar with the 105 freeway knows that even complete, it's a lousy choice for what they want; why not take the 405, which connects to the 5 on either end, giving you the option (going north) to get the hell out of LA?  Why not take the 10 and do the same thing? The 105 is only 25 or so miles long.  Third, and most egregious, there is NO WAY IN HELL a bus can leap the gap shown in the freeway, and even if it could (if, say, a ramp had been placed there, which it hadn't), it would never be able to maintain a wheel speed registering 50 MPH or above.  It's a simple law of physics.The second instance is the ending.  Having handcuffed Bullock onto a support rail in a subway car, and Reeves not having the handcuff keys, and the controls being shot to hell and the brakes not working (a very contrived situation), Reeves decides to save the day by speeding up so he'll disrail and smash into most of subterranean LA.  Huh???  Wouldn't slowing down to a minimum speed work very nicely?  I mean, all you need to do at that point is come to a stop without getting killed so someone can bring in a hacksaw, right?  The resultant crash is all very fun, but ultimately stupid.Anyway, like I said, it's a pretty good popcorn movie, and it's loads better than its sequel.  I gave it a 6 for entertainment value.",6,1,2,25 February 2003
Amélie," C'est magnifique!
","Light, whimsical, funny, and touching, Amélie turned out to be a rare subtitled movie that I completely forgot was subtitled.  I was so engrossed by the story and the acting (especially the lovely, sprite-like Audrey Tautou in the eponymous role) that the subtitles bothered me not one whit. 
I won't recap the plot, but I will tell you that despite the R rating, I felt like almost anyone with the patience for the subtitles could watch this movie. I don't get too uptight about nudity -- I think violence is much more harmful to older children than nudity.  This sweet film comes from the heart, similar to Greek Wedding, but without the schmaltz and the ethnic humor (although I still loved Greek Wedding).  It gets a bit slow in spots, and it becomes a little overcontrived towards the end, but its heart is always in the right place.Le film, c'est magnifique.  8 out of 10.",8,0,2,31 December 2002
Braveheart," Good, not great, flawed by inaccuracies
","I enjoyed Braveheart and would recommend the movie as epic entertainment more than historical insight.  The fighting scenes were terrifically staged and the film captures the theme of Scottish nationalism.  (Contrary to an earlier opinion, war paint was in fact used by Celts in battle and was not added for melodramatic effect; you could argue that it was melodramatic but it was not in error.)In fact, the historical Wallace not only embodied nationalism but in large part created it, at least a century before Joan of Arc, who usually gets the credit.  Mel Gibson was good, not great, as Hollywood's Wallace, and the supporting cast is outstanding.That being said, a lot of historical facts need to be sorted out if you want to know the REAL story of William Wallace.1. Wallace was no reluctant warrior; before his girlfriend (not wife) was murdered, he had already built a fearful reputation for killing Englishmen in Scotland.  The historical record shows that Wallace loved his work and had always been very good at it.  His girlfriend's murder occurs late in his career.2. William Wallace actually co-ruled an independent Scotland for a few months (there are treaties signed by Wallace) between the battles of Stirling Bridge and Falkirk.3. Robert the Bruce was not about to be named a puppet King of Scotland on the fields of Bannockburn, as shown in the final scenes of the movie.  He had already declared himself an independent king and Edward II's army was there to engage and destroy him.  Outnumbered 2-1, Robert destroyed the English army at Bannockburn in 1314, creating a de facto independent Scotland that was confirmed by treaty in 1328.4. Edward II did not marry until after Wallace was dead, so the whole ridiculous subplot with Sophie Marceau could not possibly have been true. It doesn't even pass the laugh test.  However, apparently Edward II was a terrible king; Churchill himself refers to him as 'a perverted weakling' and 'an unworthy successor to Edward I'.  So the notion in an earlier post that this is an American propaganda slant is not true.These are not minor points and the movie is flawed by its misrepresentations.  It is still enjoyable and probably captures the essence of the cause that Wallace fought and died for.  8 out of 10",8,1,3,8 June 2000
Gladiator," Neither great nor bad -- good entertainment
","This is a much quirkier film than you would expect from a gladiator epic, and it's going to disappoint some people.First off, it is NOT history, although a few historical characters are used. In the film's defense, it really doesn't try to BE history, either, merely using historical backdrops for a morality play.  Although, having said that, the opening battle use of the longbow is an anachronism, I believe; the longbow didn't come into use until the thirteenth or fourteenth century, and its origin was Welsh and English.  Minor point, but since I have castigated other movies on similar points ...The performances were outstanding, subtle, and complex, even the sometimes over-the-top performance of Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus.  Connie Nielsen is especially effective, and for the first half of the film you're not quite sure where her character stands.  I thought Oliver Reed was breathtaking in this film.  It's the only film I've seen where I liked Reed, and what a shame he passed away during the filming.The script gets pretty conventional in the second half of the film, and therefore predictable.  However, the visual presentation is stunning, with washout coloring and inventive camera techniques.  I can understand why these might be irritating to other filmgoers, especially if they're expecting a traditional epic.  Obviously, I liked it.Overall, it's a good film, not a great one, and not one everyone will appreciate.  I think it's overall ranking is excessive, and I rated it a 7.",7,0,0,27 June 2000
Rock Star," The clichés will underwhelm you
","Some movies are good, some are bad, and the rest are mediocre.  Rock Star definitely falls into the latter group, buried under unknown-deals-with-fame clichés that are so timeworn you can almost see them unravel.Mark Wahlberg is the lead singer in a 'tribute' band in the mid-80s and Jennifer Aniston is his manager/girlfriend, and both give good performances. Wahlberg is especially good at lip-synching the vocals (provided by another heavy-metal singer, see Trivia).  Aniston is the one character I really gave a damn about; she is so much better in movies than she is in television. She has to get out of Friends.  **Mild SPOILERS**In fact, there really weren't any bad performances, and the production values looked pretty good to me.  The movie's script chokes on all of the clichés: band break-up, hard partying, fame going to the young man's head, girl leaves him because of his infidelity, disillusionment. etc.  Anyone could have written this script in about 20 minutes.  Most laughable to me was the constant reference to Seattle ... I just knew that he would wind up becoming a grunge act (most definitely a suburban version of Kurt Cobain, right down to the sweater!).  Almost Famous covers the same backstage drama but the characters are so much less two-dimensional than in Rock Star, and it rises above the clichés. Ultimately, Rock Star has no life or energy outside of the music.  5 out of 10.",5,1,2,16 August 2002
High Fidelity," On second thought, a good film
","Originally, I wrote a rather harsh critique of this film. On subsequent viewings -- and oddly, after reading the book -- I've come to appreciate High Fidelity much more.John Cusack and Iben Hjelje make an interesting mismatch of a couple, which is the fulcrum of most of the film. Cusack drives her away and then spends the entire time trying to win her back without quite understanding why. He's approaching middle age and has begun to question his choices and his lack of responsibility.In truth, most men reach Cusack's dilemma in their early twenties, but Cusack's Rob is a case of arrested development.
