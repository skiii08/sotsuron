Hereditary," Standard horror really
","Hereditary, I had high hopes for with the trailer looking really interesting, and somewhat different to most other horror /thriller films. Sure the ending messes with you to the point where you really question what happened and leaves you with the blank expression of '???Pardon me???'. Overall I wasn't a fan of this but considering I don't like horror / thrillers this one did a pretty good job of holding my attention right till the end.",6,0,1,17 December 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Must see for any comic fan
","Soundtrack I've got to mention is an absolute killer. The art and how it's shot is beautifully well crafted to add extra layers to the story without you even realising. Long standing fans of spiderman are going to be in love with this. All in all its a marvel masterpiece with a touching moment at the end of the film to give thanks to Stan and Steve for all they have done for the comic world we live in today.
And the post scene credit sequence is just.. Words can't describe that.",10,2,5,17 December 2018
Creed II," More rocky than rocky
","Gripping story, rich and beautiful cinematography with well rounded characters that make you feel as if you know them in a personal manner. The fight scenes in this are fantastically choreographed and filmed to make it look like this was a documentary of a fight that actually happened. So much so some person in front of me in the cinema got so into the fight at the end he took his shirt off and cheered it certainly was something I've never seen before but honestly I couldn't blame the dude it was intense. Perfect addition to the Rocky / Creed franchise, lives up to and exceeded my expectations.",9,0,1,17 December 2018
