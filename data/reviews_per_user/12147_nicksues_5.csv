Requiem for a Dream," Great movie that might be to realistic for some people.
","This movie is #4 on my top 10 list, and although you most likely will not smile once during the entire film, it is still phenomenal. A realistic look at what drug addiction can do to a person. I am a big fan of movies and i recommended this to a few friends, most of them said it ruined their day, but if a film makes you feel that bad it has to be good. The film is so realistic, once it sucks you in you almost feel as the characters in the movie do and thats what a good movie should do. This movie should be shown to teens when they get in high school or maybe even 8th grade. Instead of d.a.r.e class or teachers and parents preaching to their students to not take drugs they should just show this film, if i would have seen this i probably would have never even touched pot, the movie frightened me and i was 23 when i first saw it. Great job by Darren Aronofsky and cast this movie should have won some Oscar's but it may have been to real for some people.",10,2,4,16 August 2006
Cloverfield," Cloverfield is what it is ...
","The movie is what it is, a movie about a giant monster that destroys Manhattan and kills a bunch of people along the way. I thought it was pretty cool, i don't know what people were expecting but i don't see any reason to call the movie a piece of crap. It was entertaining and thats all you can ask for in movie like this. You don't need great acting you just need to be simply entertained. I thought it was a good idea to have the movie shot from the point of view of one of the charters it made you feel like you were there. Does it get Oscar nods ... no, was there great acting .... not really but thats because the movie is what it is ... BUILDING DESTROYING, PEOPLE EATING, MONSTER MOVIE ... and thats exactly what you get when you rent Cloverfield.",6,0,1,7 June 2008
The Illusionist," Worth the price of admission.
","It was either going to be Whicker Man or The Illusionist and thanks to IMDb we chose the better of the two which was The Illusionist. I read a few comments on this film and most of them were praising it. There were a few that said the acting by Jessica Biel was bad and that the ending was predictable. I didn't think Jessica put in an Oscar performance but she certainly wasn't bad - she did a fine job, i would have to say there was a part or two that were a little predictable but by no means did these two things make the movie bad in anyway. The movie keeps the viewer very much interested and Ed Norton does a great job as usual. Paul Giammati proves once again why he is one of the better actors in the business right now, he does a great job playing a chief inspector trying to discover how the mysterious magician played by Ed Norton does these very fascinating illusions. It is a little bit of a love story but it is not over done in anyway, it is suspenseful and will have you anxious to see the outcome, which I'm sure will not let you down. Definitely worth the price of admission - go see this movie.",8,2,3,2 September 2006
World Trade Center," It is your duty as an American to see this movie!
","I was on vacation from work last week but did not go out of town, my girlfriend had to work so basically it was going to be a whole week of nothing but being lazy, which is deserved considering i go to college and work. It did not take long before i found myself to be board and searching for something to do. I saw a preview for World Trade Center on the t.v. around noon and the preview did what it was supposed to do. It made me go into our kitchen and get out the newspaper, there was a 1:00 show and i really wanted to see it. I felt kind of weird about going to the movies by myself because i had never done that before and i knew my girl wanted to see it too and she would be (and was) mad that i went to see it without her. Finally i decided to go see it and for whatever reason i had to see it right that moment. I got to the theater and there was only about 12 people tops (including myself)and some other people were there by themselves so i didn't feel as dumb as i thought i would. I really wanted to see the movie because it is something that happened during my life and a day we all will never forget, i wanted to get a feel for what these two very brave men went through although i knew it was nothing nice and that the movie would be very sad and if at all happy it would be a happy sad. The movie was Phenomenal i sat by myself a 25 year old man and cried my eyes out at like 4 or 5 different parts. The movie was so good and i got so into it i basically put myself in the shoes of these characters and i cant even describe in words how great of a movie it was. All i do have to say is i think it is your duty as an American to go see this film. Obviously we all will never forget the tragic events that took place that day and sometimes we probably don't even want to think about that because of how truly sad and devastating it was, but we as Americans who are not from New York (im from Milwaukee, Wi) and were not actually there that day have to see this. Get into the film put yourself in their shoes and you will get somewhat of a better visual idea of how it may have felt to be there that day. It is sad but there is also a happy sad type moment when the two officers are pulled from the wreckage and their families become aware that they are indeed alive. Please see this movie, there is no possible way you can be disappointed the movie makes you sad, makes you cry, makes you proud to be an Amerian and that is what a good movie should make you feel. Don't go see something stupid don't waste $8.75 or whatever the cost is in your city on some movie that is not World Trade Center because if you are an American then you need to see this movie and if you don't see it at all whether at the theater or at home then shame on you.",10,1,5,24 August 2006
Black Snake Moan," Shined with originality.
","I love watching movies and i have seen many, a lot of the new movies that come out have basically the same plots as movies that have already been made, they just have different actors and minor changes. Than every once in a while a movie comes along that just shines with originality and has a story and plot line that hasn't been seen before. Black Snake Moan has just that, it's different from any other movie out there and thats what makes it a great movie, along with excellent performances by Samuel L. Jackson, Christina Ricci, and even Justin Timberlake. If you are a fan of movies and want to see something that you haven't seen before in any other movie than go see and enjoy Black Snake Moan. Six people got up and left the theater during this movie and my girlfriend and i were not shocked because people who went to see this movie probably thought they were going to see a comedy but the movie is more of a drama with some dark comedy mixed in. I loved it and it will be a part of my DVD collection when it comes out. Go see it awesome flick!",8,1,4,25 March 2007
