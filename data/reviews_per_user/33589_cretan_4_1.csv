Angels & Demons," Could be Better
","It was a good movie but nothing special.Personally i found The da vinci come more adventurous and intense. This movie has slower rate of action and agony.The party starts from the last half of the movie.everything else its just talking... So the Book is way more better and we have seen movies more precise to their books (Lord of the rings, Green mile). Although the cast is good and the characters and dialogues. Beside of that there is a chance to get bored with all these dialogues that basically has nothing to offer more than spend the time...until the action starts. Average rating for me 6/10 In a few words: Better to see it on Bluray/DVD rather than Cinema.",6,10,23,15 May 2009
