The Blair Witch Project," Overrated & Overhyped - A complete disappointment
","Never have I gone into a movie expecting so much and receiving so little. As for concepts, I'd give it a 7 out of 10 but for content the movie just stunk. People actually got up to leave the theatre 3/4 of the way through because of sheer boredom and nausea from the camera action.",Null,0,1,3 August 1999
