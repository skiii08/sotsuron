"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Marvellous!
","This is one of the most wonderful films ever made.  Never mind the gaudy, unselfconsciousness or flamboyance.  Its ultimately a film about acceptance, extremely positive, and almost everybody I know who has seen it loved it.My personal favourite moment is when Tick is playing the butch man for the benefit of his son, and realises not only that his son knows that he is a gay man and a drag performer, but that he totally accepts this as normal. Its a hugely poigniant moment.  Its probably hard to understand if you've never had something about yourself that could be tough for others to accept. The transgendered person.  The widow.  The gay man trying to solicialise with thugs in a tough town.  The gay father.  That gay man whose been married with children.  All of the characters are looking for acceptance and the reassurance for each of them is reassuring to the audience, and it speaks in particular to gay and t/g audiences.I thought this film had a lot in common with the more bittersweet 'Torch Song Trilogy', but with a more positive ending.  Firstein's early film ends on an ambiguous note, almost back where he started, with the unpredictable bisexual boyfriend and uncertain future.The whole mail-order bride thread was utterly hilarious, her desperation for attention and hyperactivity a real hoot.Also the soundtrack - very camp, slightly retero.  Funny thing about this film is how it hasn't really dated.",Null,3,7,23 April 2003
