Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I had great expectations
","I went to see the movie because it got so many great reviews and I liked the trailer. I walked into the movie theater thinking I would have a great time. It seemed to be a fun satirical movie. Well, I was very very wrong. I sat there, glancing at my watch, just wishing it would end soon. Some parts of the movie were just gross and not the least bit funny. I must admit that I did laugh, but only a few times. By the time I walked out of the movie theater I was completely disappointed. The idea of making a documentary about a foreigner that travels to America could have been done much better. Do NOT watch this movie unless there is absolutely nothing better to watch.",2,4,8,7 January 2007
