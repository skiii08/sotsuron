Mission: Impossible III," Nice action flick... Cruise still brings it
","Well, I truly didn't expect much out of this film. With all the preproduction problems and changes, I thought this would be a cluster. Also, the Bond-ish improbability of some of the stunts in MI-II were disappointing. This movie showed some heartbreak and emotion that was a pleasant surprise. Some of the fight scenes were truly well-done. But once... just once... I'd like to see someone do what they would do in real life if hit directly in the jaw... PASS OUT!!! Geeez! But MI-III is guilty as charged with the rest of Hollywierd in that crime. On the whole, this movie is well acted, filmed, and has the international flavor and feel a true spy-flick should.",7,1,1,24 January 2007
The Bourne Identity," Edgy action, international flavor
","The first time a watched this movie I was so surprised. The fighting scenes, the driving, the locations. It was glamorous, but not in a James Bond way. This type of spy movie seemed more palatable and real. I mean, did you ever see Bond disable people that efficiently? And, isn't that what spies and special ops agents are supposed to do? So, I was hooked. Even the old standby of amnesia was played out well. It was great to watch Bourne's superiors freak out about dis-associative amnesia and their super-spy 'shortcircuiting.' I also liked the fact that you never fully trusted ANYONE in this movie. That made for great tension. In the end, I wanted to go right out and get my own Sigarms 550 .223 sniper rifle, but it costs $15,000. And THAT, my friends, is why we have movies!!!",9,1,2,19 January 2007
The Departed," Twisted corruption... talented cast
","Wow... what a cast. Everyone in this movie brings it. The talent pool here is so deep the story lines could stink and the movie still may have a change to be good. Thankfully, this movie keeps you guessing as to possible outcomes until the end. Casting Bostonians like Wahlberg and Damon doesn't hurt either. No fake accents and attitudes make things more believable. The violence in this movie is grotesquely real. Gun shots wounds and brain matter are everywhere. The movie has very nice tension due to the undercover work and the havoc that plays on the life of an officer. Try to get past the violence and sit back and watch good actors do their thing in this movie... and by all means keep the kids away from this one.",8,0,0,19 January 2007
The Bourne Supremacy," Gladly more of the same-high tension and international flavor
","Again, Jason Bourne is the real super-spy. While the Bond franchise and other projects with similar influences cross way over the reality threshold, Bourne is easier to swallow. You don't walk out of the theater laughing about the improbability of some scenes. Where the first movie starts stormy and icy, this movie starts warm and cozy. This is a nice trick, because there is never a calm day for a real CIA operative. Who do you trust? Not a soul. Who could be after you? Just about anyone, including your own (ex) colleagues. The Bourne series has actually made me more aware of my surroundings. I take everything in that I can. Bourne's world is crazy, but so is ours. After watching this series, who can get 'comfortable?' Hey, it beats boredom!!!",9,3,4,19 January 2007
