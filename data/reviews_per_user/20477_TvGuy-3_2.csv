The Blair Witch Project," A cinematic 'cow chip' but a marketing coup
","This movie is the marketing coup of the century. The people who marketed the film have actually made chocolate ice cream out of excrement. As a producer, I could only strain to hold my dinner in while watching this inept excuse for film making. But the person (or people) who thought to sell the film, and I use that word with trepidation, as a 'mock-umentary' hit the marketing mother lode.My dog has more creativity in getting a whole carrot cake down from the kitchen counter than do the makers of this film. But the marketer, ah, there is a modern-day P.T. Barnum, who realizes that there are millions of suckers out there.",1,2,4,7 August 1999
Saving Private Ryan," A film to be put in a time capsule.
","As few others have done before him, Steven Spielberg depicts war as the true nightmare that it is. No glamorization here; Sherman's phrase 'war is hell' seems like a day at the beach compared to what we see in 'Saving Private Ryan.' The only other film I can recall that delineates war to be as horrific as it appears in 'Ryan' is Kubrick's 'Paths of Glory,' albeit for different reasonsThe cinematography, special effects, sets, and costumes all create a mind-boggling sense of realism. The script is haunting. Phrases just linger in one's mind, such as Captain Miller's rueful observation that every  man he kills takes him a little further away from home.Spielberg's direction is just that: direct. There is no dazzling  visual trickery here, just naturalistic movie making at it's best.  When I left the theater, I felt grateful to the men who fought the fight of WWII.",10,0,1,12 November 1999
