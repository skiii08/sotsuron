The Lobster," what the hell was this
","Man .. I don't know .. may be I don't have the wits to understand such movies or may be whatever .. I just didn't get anything except the plot.The plot was not so tough to understand to be honest. In a dystopian society any single person has 45 days to find a partner else they would be converted in to an animal of their choice.
And that is it .. that is it of the horror that 'The lobster' was.I don't care if there were hidden meanings in there or black comedy or something which I overlooked .. I don't care .. All I know that this movie is nothing but a frustrating watch.
Please do not and save yourselves.",3,1,1,15 June 2020
