The Ring," Scary beyond words
","The Ring was well filmed, well written, and had some very good acting, especially Naomi Watts.  Overall this is one of the best horror films to have come out in years.  The plot twists are very intricate, and the ending is completely unexpected.This is not a good as the Sixth Sense (as it has been compared to) but as good as horror movies of the past, such as the {original} Exorcist or the {original} Omen.This movie scared my wife so badly that she couldn't sleep that night!Watch this movie with an open mind, read the IMDB Movie Trivia section prior to watching it, hit the bathroom just before the movie starts, and pay special attention to the final scene.",7,0,0,8 November 2002
