E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," E.T. as a Christ Symbol
","I am not the most religious child, but the similarities between the biblical accounts of Jesus Christ and the story of E.T., a stranded alien, are uncanny. Think about it...E.T. comes to earth from another place, he has the ability to heal people (simply by touching them), he preaches for the children to 'Be good' and informs them that he always will be with them in mind and spirit, he dies as a result of authority (the scientists) and is then resurrected. It is through E.T. that the children learn that there is more to life. This can clearly be seen when Elliot's brother is riding the bus. While others on the bus behave in childish, sinful ways..he goes uneffected by his surroundings.  There are also Elliot's brother's friends, who doubt E.T.'s existence, they are doubters. It isn't until they see E.T., elevated in the government van (wearing a robe), that they believe and attempt to save him.  Another similarity: the only adult shown to be nurturing and pure is Elliot's mother..her name? Mary. It is no wonder this film was the highest grossing film, for it is simply a retelling of the 'greatest story ever told.'",Null,0,0,7 April 1999
