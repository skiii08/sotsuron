Resident Evil: Afterlife," Another amazing movie for the Resident Evil series
","Actually I am not sure where to start. I watched the movie in 3D and it was quite good I have to say... The return of some of the characters from the previous movie, Resident Evil: Extinction actually surprised me. The way of connecting the previous characters' stories to this movie was good, especially Claire's. I am more happy to see that some other person's fighting scene is not shown only in background. Claire's fight with the big monster (which I thought first it was Nemesis) made me concentrate on the move even more.. Besides these, I saw that zombies had some modifications :) This movie had more tense scenes comparing to previous ones, which actually made it more exciting for me... By the end, it probably gives us the signs that there will be a fifth movie of Resident Evil series is coming up. I will be happy to see Milla Jovovich again ;)",7,7,15,14 September 2010
