The Blair Witch Project," Film both mocks and provokes.
","I attended the film with my twenty-one and twenty-two-year-old sons. While the film reminded me of a horror version of Real World, it was not that scary.  I think the profanity was way overdone and if most college students need to use the f-word to fill in the gaps as many times as these actors did, then woe to the world!  There were a few frightening scenes, although the 'stick-and-rope' people was not one of them.  I found the rock piles captivating as they were slightly druidic as was the scene where Heather discovers Josh's clothing wrapped around something grotesque and bloody. The story-line was great, and the ending captivating, but all of the bickering between the actors about the map, getting lost, and needing a cigarette, ( embellished with all of that profanity I mentioned), took away most of the horror the film was meant to convey.  The best thing about the film was the dialog that followed after the return home.  My twenty-something sons actually spent time discussing something other than baseball standings and Tekken 2, and that was refreshing.  I spent $7.50 on the ticket to see the film, and if I had to do it over again, I would wait until it came out on video.  This film can be watched on small screen and lose nothing at all.",Null,0,1,4 October 1999
