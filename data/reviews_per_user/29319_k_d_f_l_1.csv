Vertigo," The Best Movie Ever!!!
","This is the best movie ever, with more depth than I have ever seen. In 2003, I flew from New York to San Francisco just to see the sights in the movie.Scottie's (Jimmy Stewart's) apartment is located at 900 Lombard Street (corner of Jones), one block downhill from the famous crooked street. The door is no longer red, but the doorbell and mailbox are still in the same place. The bushes have definitely grown! Seeing this apartment gave me chills. You would recognize it even if you didn't have the address.Coit Tower can be seen from the apartment as in the movie.Madeline's (Kim Novak's) apartment is located at 1000 Mason Street. It looks the same.The Misson San Juan Bautista is 100 miles south of San Francisco. It was creepy. There is not a bell tower there. The eucalyptus trees that Scotty and Madeline drove through (the divided highway) to get there is actually a few minutes south of San Juan Bautista. Therefore, they would not have passed through that area on their way from San Francisco to San Juan Bautista.A person at Mission Deloris showed me where the headstone was located in the movie. It was eerie.I had a picture of me taken at the Palace of the Legion of Honor, sitting on the bench where Kim Novak sat. Also, they have a great Vertigo scrapbook for visitors to look at.Scotty and Judy walked outside of the Palace of Fine Arts. It looked the same.Muir Woods looked the exact same. The sign that Madeline pointed to and said 'This is when I was born. This is when I died' is there. The steep mountain to get there is real.Fort Point does not have the steps that were shown in the movie.Ernie's restaurant is no longer there.What a trip! I took tons of photos.",10,8,11,1 January 2005
