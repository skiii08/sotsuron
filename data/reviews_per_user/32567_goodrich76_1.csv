The Avengers," Good Movie, Not As Great As People Are Saying.
","This movie was a good movie, it had a good base but it simply wasn't this game-changing movie that people seem to think it is. It's just one of those action-packed, no-intellect-required movies. For this to be #34 in the top movies of all time is shameful. I'm sure many people can think of 250 movies that're far superior to this one.The acting itself was fine, although it did seem a little awkward at times. The dialogue did get extremely cheesy, although it was good cheesy. But good cheesy doesn't cut it in a 8+ movie.Altogether, if you're looking for one of those visually striking, entertaining movies, go see this one. But DON'T expect to be awestruck when you leave. Again, good, but not amazing.",7,3,9,24 May 2012
