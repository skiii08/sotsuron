The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Incredible
",I don't normally like these kind of movies but this was different this movie is a perfect representation of being a kid who just can't fit in its a perfect story about a troubled kid who doesn't have any friends the start of freshmen year right away we can tell something's wrong with him he keeps having flashbacks of his aunt and his mind goes Black and he doesn't remember what happened he meets two seniors and they become His only friends soon he is introduced to the rest or there group he ends up making A lot of new friends and going to parties he has a crush on Sam his friend and really wants her the way this started was done very well it wasn't a love at first sight kind of thing he explains that he look into her eyes and experienced her beauty when she standing in the car this is a beautiful scene this whole movie is full of Surprises but there not crammed in they feel natural and Make the movie better this movie makes you reflect on life and How you lived it it also makes you reflect on you as a person this movie left me with a very warm feeling that wasn't forgotten until the next day also this movie really relates to a lot of people it tells the story of the girl of your dreams that you wanted so badly but just couldn't get all the characters are done beautifully and I couldn't think of a better cast each one plays there role like they are them also the music is great it really creates the mood of the movie you should definitely go see this movie it is amazing and Among my favorites,10,2,4,6 November 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," great movie really explains original
",Finally a good newer remake that can actually relate to the original when i saw the previews i thought the movie looked okay but after seeing it my thoughts have changed the graphics were great they actually looked like real apes with a great storyline it still relates to the original but with some differences this movie really did a good job at sticking to its story and you could really relate to the apes and you felt bad for them the characters have great personality's and good stories for them all overall this movie was very good only at some parts it got boring other than that it is definitely going into my movie collection,7,3,8,5 August 2011
Psycho," great movie a favorite
",this movie is one of Hitchcock's best if anyone says Alfred Hitchcock you should think psycho the reason why this is is because it is a true masterpiece when i saw this in 2011 i loved it the black and white gave a classic feel to it that you don't get anymore all scenes are executed perfectly especially the shower scene this is my favorite scene of all time when Alfred gives a good movie changing experience through a simple stabbing scene this scene really pops out to me because it isn't just like other stabbing sequences it really gives you great camera angles great shots and perfect execution of a great scene and the whole movie is like this not once was i bored because it keeps throwing you surprises this is my favorite movie and so far nothing has made it close except the godfather,10,1,1,5 August 2011
