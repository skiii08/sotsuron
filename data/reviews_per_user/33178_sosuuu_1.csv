Requiem for a Dream," concurrently depressing and amazing
","I rated this film with 10/10 Stars and I personally think it really deserves this high rating. I really saw a depressing and interesting movie like this. It get's never boring and I really loved the Cinematography and the way it is shot. The acting is pretty good and I liked the totally different stories and characters. This film is probably so depressing because of the realness, everything that happened in this movie could happen in real life, too. The idea of this movie is great, these different addictions and the different ages of the protagonists are so sad and pitiable that you'll be so shocked and full with compassion for the victims. I really loved this film. And the music was amazing! I love the soundtrack. yeah that's actually everything, it's totally worth checking out. And sorry for my bad English.",10,0,1,25 November 2013
