Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Almost Didn't watch it, glad that I did!
","This is Abe Lincoln with a twist! Wonderful special effects! I am surprised how many historic facts that they worked into this movie. In fact, I think that the movie might have been a little better if they hadn't tried so hard to work in the historic facts. Great story line, I hadn't rooted for a presidential candidate so much! So glad that Corrupt Hillary Clinton wasn't in this movie! Slavery would still be around if she had her way, not to mention open lesbian relationships.Love the passion and the conviction that Abe has for his fellow man, both black and white, and who knows, maybe even brown!",8,1,2,20 July 2016
Logan," When did Wolverine become a drama??
","This was a very different and much cheaper movie. Basically it was a cross country trip, fleeing to Canada. Family seems to be the basic theme. X Men growing old and dying out without anything to show for it. They lived their lives on the run and didn't have anything to show for it in the end. You would think that the world would gradually have more and more mutants. There are more and more pesticides and chemicals everyday. This was not the case. Mutants weren't born any more and the living were hunted down and killed. Since I consider Logan to be a action movie, I wish that it had more action. The reviews I read claim that this is the best Logan movie. While I am glad that I watched it, it's 3rd in my mind.",7,1,7,25 March 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," Really good have been better!
","I like Keanu Reeves! There is just something about him. Perhaps it's spiritual, I don't quite know how to describe it. Without saying anything, I was taking in and was rooting for this guy, but I don't understand why. His presence somehow took me in.My rating is largely because I don't think that it was well written. Perhaps that is wrong to say about a movie like this! Since this movie has very little dialogue. Instead, it's a testosterone filled movie, with grunting, fighting, shooting, and kicking ass! Somehow they created bigger players in the world bad guy company. They claim that they were always there, but I don't remember them in the first movie. There are a handful of players that set at the table and they control the world's crime syndicate. Keanu is tasked with killing one of the players so that someone else can take their seat. Then he kills them because they double crossed Keanu. Personally, I think that Keanu should be able to take the seat now. Instead of taking the seat, he has the whole world out for him now & they all want the bounty!",6,0,3,28 March 2017
