The Ring," One of the scariest movies ever
","The Ring is the best horror movie and that has to say something since i've seen about every good horror movie ever made. This is so unlike what the media presents as horror:blood,gore,sex, and alot of screaming but sure that's good every once and a while but not all the time. Let it be known that The Ring contains everything that I found makes a movie riveting,spellbinding, and scary as hell. This movie plays with your mind it freaks you out in ways you never thought possible, it brings out those nightmares in the back of your mind that scare you senseless. As you watch the movie it starts off scaring you right from the beginning and the fright fest never halts. The vagueness of the movie on specific subjects is what scares like for instance the actual tape that kills; it never shows how the ladder is standing up by itself or how the girl's image is in the mirror but no-one is actually there. As you play these images through your head you come up with things that force you to the edge of horror and that's what makes this movie excellent. It lets you scare yourself while it terrifies you.10/10  It makes your blood run cold with fear!!!!!!!",10,0,0,5 November 2002
