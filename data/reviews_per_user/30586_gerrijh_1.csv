The New World," just saw it
","While the movie put my date to sleep, even to the point of snoring!, I thought it was interesting. I never heard 'Rebecca' being called 'Pocahontas' at any time during the movie, but I was told this movie was based on her. I originally thought that Pocahontas was kidnapped, but rather it appears she was simply tossed aside by her father and was free to run into the 'whiteman's' arm, who alas, 'dumped her' and made her available to be courted by yet another 'whiteman'. The film therefore,made Native woman appear vulnerable and cheap. Her mother was no help, didn't even offer her guidance, which I thought was very inappropriate especially with the time-frame (1600's). Native people taught their women to be strong, not cheap, is what I always thought. Oh well, no film will every surpass 'Dances with Wolves', now that's a love story and showed and depicted Native American people as a proud people.",Null,0,6,8 February 2006
