First Man," The Right Stuff Part 2
",I read 'The Right Stuff' and thought the movie was one of the best of the 1980's. I decided to ignore the negative publicity about not showing the American flag being planted on the moon and I'm glad I did as I thought this was a pretty good telling of the first trip to the moon.I thought Ryan Gosling did a great job as Neil Armstrong. These guys must have ice water in their veins. Getting bounced off the Earth's atmosphere they would tell Mission Control that they were just hitting a bit of turbulence and that there was nothing to worry about.I have always admired Jason Clarke's work and he didn't disappoint here.I'm glad the story placed some importance to Gus Grissom who was truly a tragic figure in our space program.The only criticism I have was the dull color tone of the movie and the feeling that some of the scenes seemed to be filmed with a hand held camera.I am amazed today that we went to the moon with a fraction of the technology we have now.,8,0,1,1 November 2018
The Hunger Games," Future Gladiators
","It's hard to be objective as I enjoyed this movie so much after hearing how good it was from several of my grandchildren. It is set in some kind of an alternative universe showing what a reality TV show would look like if the Nazis had won WWII. It was a salute to every outlandish wardrobe choice and bad hairdo ever imagined. It had everything, heroes, villains, chivalry, loyalty, suffering, victory, and explosions, not to mention a love story. Stanley Tucci and Woody Harrelson couldn't have been better in supporting roles. Jennifer Lawrence was outstanding. She is a beautiful young woman that looked the part as a warrior. I guess that I will probably read the books now, as I am really looking forward to the next installment of this series.",9,1,6,1 May 2012
Apocalypse Now," What A Ride !
","One of my favorite novellas is Joseph Conrad's ' Heart of Darkness'. I am sure it will likely be banned in the future.I was drafted late in 1965, but by God's grace was spared Viet Nam. I did loose a couple of close friends there, one childhood friend on a swift boat. I saw the movie when it first came out and thought it was pretty good.The war was fought by kids and some seasoned veterans and the movie seemed to capture this. 
Robert Duvall stole the movie. His performance was over the top.",9,1,3,6 December 2018
