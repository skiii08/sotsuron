Iron Man 3," Monster parade
","The movie first of all was unnecessary because there was already a good first one, and a bad sequel. This makes you think that they did it just for the money, and not because they had something to say. You get 100% sure about that after watching the movie. As for the villains of the movie, like in all superhero movies or comics, they have superhuman powers. It is so ridiculous, all these exaggerations, with people who fly, who walk through walls, and now, people with flash-lights -lol! Also, the good woman of the story, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, becomes a monster that flashes! I thought the meaning of Ironman is the triumph of man's intelligence,with which he/she can create machines capable of anything. In the Ironman 3 man is capable only of punching around and making noise! We shouldn't forget the dance of the uniforms in the end. Ironman jumps in the air from the one uniform to the other. The uniforms fly in the air above his head, and Ironman leaves the one uniform, jumps from the terrace down, falls inside an empty uniform, flies up to the top again, leaves the uniform, and jumps again to catch another uniform. And again, and again. It may look well as a picture, but what's the possibility of this ridiculous exaggeration to happen in reality? And it's not even a first! We have seen similar scenes in James Bond (jumps and catches airplane), in Star Wars, even in the 5th Element with Bruce Willis! Art is the prototype, the cheap impromptu imitation isn't! The film also contains provocative propaganda: the president of the US wears the uniform of Ironman and saves people. The president was about 80 years old, and all this would be fun, if it wasn't subliminal brain-wash targeting the minds of the viewers! Overall, a joke, not a movie at all...",1,0,0,17 September 2017

","I really suffered with this film! I felt bleeding from my eyes! Why Sergio, seriously now, why?
The whole idea of the film is that when you have given everything you had to offer to the westerns, you invent a new era. So, Sergio Leone remembers the Revolution of Mexico. And because he has used every rediculous idea with shooting in his previous films, he now finds... explosives! But, what western can it be, when you explode innocent people crossing by? So, the Revolution gave the context, that the exploded people may in the end be 'not so good'. Well, I think he failed even in that! I sympathized the victims, I hated Leone and his arrogant, amoralist protagonists!..
I didn't really manage to watch the whole film, to be true. But believe me, I watched more than I could stand. The scenery and the explosions look so fake. The miniature of the bridge is so obvious it is a model in scale. The visual effects are worse than those in the adult films of Gousgounis, if you know! Also, the film is even more amoralistic. The one protagonist is a bandit, ok, but also a crazy killer, who enjoys slaying innocent people. In the train, one guy begs him to spare him, 'I have children', he says. The protagonist throws him off the train right away! Then he says the outrageous: 'I have children too'!?
The other protagonist is an Irish explosives expert. He enjoys doublecrossing his best friends! First, he doublecrossed IRA and his own counrty, and got found in Mexico as fugitive. Then he doublecrossed Mexicans, preparing robberies with the worst killers. Then he doublecrossed the killers, and then all from the beginning again! I wonder, what teaches us a film like this? To be a piece of crap?",3,0,2,17 February 2020
