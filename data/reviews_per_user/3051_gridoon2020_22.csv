Love and Death," Transitional Woody Allen film
","If you ever wondered about the missing link between Woody Allen's early slapstick comedies and his later, heavier stuff, this is it. While it's still very much a comedy, 'Love And Death' is noticeably mellower, slower, more mature than Woody's earlier films, with more attention paid to the story and to the general production. It's also more philosophical and theological, as Woody constantly questions the existence of God ('I wouldn't want to blow my brains out and THEN learn that they found something up there!'). It does get too verbose for its own good at times, and some parts just don't come off (his monologue about Socrates, for example). But 'Love And Death' also contains some of the most unforgettable visual gags (his military training) and classic punchlines ('You are the greatest lover I've ever had' - 'I practice a lot when I'm alone!') of Allen's career. And Diane Keaton, besides being great to look at, proves once again that her contribution to Allen's movies is invaluable - Woody himself once again, to an even larger extent than in 'Sleeper', trusts her with some comic scenes without his presence, which she pulls off fantastically ('I could have made love to you more often....once even'!!). And Woody's music selections (this time it's Prokofiev) continue to be excellent. *** out of 4.",7,1,1,18 October 2012
Skyfall," Arguably the best PTS and the worst climax of the entire series in the same movie....
","'Skyfall''s pre-title sequence ranks right up there with the series' very best ('Octopussy', 'GoldenEye', 'The World Is Not Enough', etc.): it's an exhilarating action mini-movie, expertly directed by Sam Mendes, that instantly washes away the memories of the terrible editing of the action scenes in the series' previous entry, 'Quantum Of Solace' (unlike Marc Forster, Mendes understands the importance of establishing shots, so that we know who is where and what he or she is trying to do). After this PTS gets you pumped, there is Adele's very beautiful title song (easily the best Bond song since the underrated 'The World Is Not Enough'), coupled with some unique and fascinating images during the opening credits. The movie seems to be on the right track, and then....we get a 'Rocky'-type 'comeback' story about an (initially) out-of-shape, weathered, almost resigned Bond; isn't that the same Bond that JUST started his career as a 00-agent two films back, in 'Casino Royale'? How can he be getting sick and tired of his job already? Daniel Craig himself gives his most confident performance as Bond so far, and 'Skyfall' also re-introduces some classic series characters: their appearance may not be what you expect, but they all have good chemistry with Craig and they look like they will make a solid team in the following Bond film. However, the villain of 'Skyfall' is such a patchwork of previous Bond (and non-Bond) villains (Max Zorin for the hair and the crazy laugh, Alec Trevelyan for his MI6 past and betrayal, and that's just the Bond ripoffs) that even Bardem can't create a new fresh character out of that recipe. And the entire climax of the movie, where Bond devises a mind-bogglingly stupid plan to 'trap' the villain, is an almost total misfire, apart from two outstanding moments: Albert Finney's 'Welcome to Scotland' (which is also probably the best line in the movie), and Bond's seriously angry look when the bad guys destroy his beloved Aston Martin! One more good sequence: the London tube chase - during rush hour, no less! It's funny and exciting. And one more bad: Severin's cruel death. It's crass and distasteful. **1/2 out of 4.",6,3,9,2 November 2012
Spartacus," A near-masterpiece
","'Spartacus' is one of the greatest of all the historical epics - chiefly because it has a lot of humanity and intelligence to go along with its grand spectacle. More than 'just' an account of a slave rebellion, it is also a love story for the ages, and a look into the political power play of 70 BC Rome. Dalton Trumbo's savvy script has a lot of remarkable lines ('We buy everything else these days, no reason why we shouldn't be charged for patriotism' or 'I'm even more of a civilian than most civilians'). Kirk Douglas heads a distinguished cast and gives one of the finest performances of his career; I cannot picture anyone else in the title role. His love story with Jean Simmons has a passion and a purity that are rarely equalled in Hollywood. Peter Ustinov steals every scene he's in as a groveling slave trader, and Woody Strode is unforgettable as a huge, taciturn gladiator. The production values are top-notch, from Saul Bass' imposing title sequence and Alex North's superb score to the incredible crowd scenes and the painful-looking stunts. It's one of my all-time favorite films; it holds up beautifully in repeat viewings, and I never fail to cry with Tony Curtis' song. ***1/2 out of 4.",9,5,7,26 February 2017
Balls of Fury," Has its moments
","A comic take on both the 'Karate Kid' and the 'Enter the Dragon' formulas (replacing kung fu with ping pong), 'Balls of Fury' is not a great comedy but it has its moments. If I had to single out the one actor who gets the most laughs, it would be James Hong, who spoofs many of the 'wise old master' clichés ('I need your advice, Master' - 'I'm afraid I can't help you. The game is not in the paddle, the game is in YOU; that's usually my big finish'). Maggie Q wears some tight & skimpy outfits and has 2 crisp, well-edited fight scenes - this film turned me more into a believer than 'Die Hard 4' did. Christopher Walken is actually kind of disappointing here - not for his performance, but for the fact that the script gives him little juicy dialogue to work with (Max Zorin is still my favorite Bond villain!). The main lead, Dan Fogler, is on-and-off, just like the film: some jokes hit the target, some fall flat (the spoofy Matrix-type bullet-time effects have gotten pretty tired by the year 2007). Helped by quite a few familiar faces in the supporting cast, 'Balls of Fury' is colorful, undemanding fun. (**)",5,1,1,28 April 2008
The Hateful Eight," Gratuitous violence and gratuitous overlength
","What's the matter with Tarantino? There's no denying the man's talent, but in his latest film he seems to have lost control, or maybe he just doesn't know when to quit. This film has been referred to as a 'return', of sorts, to his debut feature 'Reservoir Dogs', but whereas 'Dogs' was tightly and economically constructed, with nary a wasted moment, 'The Hateful Eight' is overblown and ridiculously overlong; it should have been half as long. And Tarantino seems to revel so much in violence, ugliness, nihilism and misanthropy (not to mention misogyny) that the film leaves you with a 'bleccch' feeling. Even the mystery turns out not to matter much, since everyone is guilty anyway! Or maybe we are supposed to take this as a very black, over-the-top comedy. But the dialogue is rarely as witty or as memorable as expected, and when the few laughs do come, the audience's senses are pretty much numbed already. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is super, but the film is little more than an exercise in killing off characters for shock value only. * out of 4.",3,36,70,12 January 2016
Full Metal Jacket," Nothing new, but well done
","'Full Metal Jacket' offers no new insights on the Vietnam war. Stanley Kubrick tells us nothing in this film that Oliver Stone hadn't already told us just a year before, in 'Platoon'. But it's still a memorable movie experience. The first third is both a clichéd 'Marines-in-training' story with an expected tragic ending, and a profanely funny satire on militarism (Lee Ermey as the commanding drill instructor is the life of the movie). The middle section is shapeless and doesn't seem to be going anywhere, but the final segment, about a group of marines ambushed by an unseen sniper, is extremely well done: you feel as if you are there with them. It's an uneven, often obvious, but still powerful film. *** out of 4.",7,1,2,3 June 2017
Top Secret!," ðŸŽµ How silly can you get?ðŸŽµ
","Val Kilmer scores a bull's eye in his star-making film debut as an Elvis-like rock star in this sporadic but frequently inspired spy spoof, with many memorable gags (my single favorite: the priest reading Kilmer his last rites). Not quite in the league of 'Naked Gun', but a minor classic of its kind in its own right. **1/2 out of 4.",6,0,0,24 February 2019
Rocky IV," 'Rocky' for the MTV age
","Virtually the same movie as 'Rocky III', with a better (and longer) climactic fight, but Dolph Lundgren, although physically intimidating, is a wooden log in terms of personality in comparison to Mr.T. Stallone's screenplay is formulaic to the extreme, and often ridiculous (how can anyone last 15 rounds with a man who supposedly has three times the punching power of the average heavyweight? As for the Russian crowd chanting 'Rocky! Rocky!', yeah, sure...), but as a director he keeps the film speeding like a runaway locomotive, and the editing is sometimes exhilaratingly masterful. Killer - and timeless - 1980s soundtrack. **1/2 out of 4.",6,0,0,5 December 2017
Resident Evil," Well made but derivative
","'Resident Evil' is notable today mainly for launching the longest and most commercially successful so far action-heroine franchise of the new century. Milla Jovovich, in her now-iconic red dress, looks amazing and acts naturally (as opposed to Michelle Rodriguez's forced performance). The film does not have an ending - just a setup for the next chapter. It's well made, with an impressive production design and some moments of effective tension; but it's also very derivative, and the mediocre digital effects may make you nostalgic for the good ol' days of practical gore. Trivia question: how much did that extra who got his neck snapped between Milla's powerful thighs got paid? Because I would have done the part for free....**1/2 out of 4.",6,0,0,14 February 2015
Quantum of Solace," A mixed bag; the actors and the character bits deliver, but the action sequences (mostly) do not
","'Quantum Of Solace' opens rather poorly: a potentially great car chase in Italy is undermined by the lack of establishing shots, the jerky, rapid editing and the ultra-tight close-ups. Sadly, (after an uninspired song & titles sequence), this pattern continues for the rest of the action sequences: the stunts are great and the special effects convincing, but when you can't see who is doing what to whom, they feel like a bit of a waste. And the first half of QOS seems to follow the globe-trotting minimal-dialogue action-action-action pattern of 'Tomorrow Never Dies'. Thankfully, after Marc Forster gets this initial bombardment of action out of his system, he settles down a little and the film becomes more balanced. Forster is considered a character director, not an action director, and he proves that here: the small character moments are handled much better than the big slam-bang action sequences.Daniel Craig forms, along with George Lazenby, the duo of the most physical Bond actors to date. One stunt in particular, jumping from one building to the top of a moving bus to another building, is straight out of a Jackie Chan movie ('Police Story 2', I believe). He is also good in the serious dramatic moments, but he still needs some work on how to milk his comic dialogue. Olga Kurylenko is a very good Bond girl. She is beautiful, tough but not superhumanly so, and shares many common traits with Bond (a dark past, an angry mood, guns expertise, not to mention a knack for coming out of a battle with a lot of cuts!). I actually felt a stronger connection at the end between her and Bond than between Bond and Vesper. The scene where she is surrounded by flames and scared and Bond tries to comfort her works better than the similar 'shower scene' with Bond and Vesper in CR. Gemma Arterton is a wonderful secondary Bond girl, but severely underused; in any case, every minute she is on the screen represents the strongest link of QOS to the past Bond movies. Mathieu Amalric is a major upgrade on the completely unthreatening Le Chiffre; Amalric has the perfect accent and facial features for his slimy role, and he's not afraid to go one-on-one against Bond when the circumstances demand it. Jesper Christensen steals the film with only 2 scenes, just like he did in CR; he also has the best line in the film: 'Tosca is not for everyone!'. More of Mr. White, please. To say that Judi Dench and Giancarlo Giannini are as solid as ever would be redundant - so let me just add that Jeffrey Wright makes unquestionably the deepest Felix Leiter that has ever appeared in the series. Probably the only disappointment in the cast is Anatole Taubman as Elvis, who is only memorable for his laughable wig (I've seen the film twice now and I honestly don't even remember what happens to him!).Is it better than Casino Royale? In my opinion it has a better girl, a better villain and better dialogue (no 'I have no armor left' or 'little fingers' here), but Martin Campbell's direction was smoother and less pretentious, and the poker game was terrific. I give them both a 6/10. Let's hope Craig's third Bond film finds the ideal balance between all the necessary Bond ingredients - the balance that no Bond movie after GoldenEye has quite achieved.",6,0,2,9 November 2008
The Butterfly Effect," Director's cut version - what an ending!
","For most of its running length, 'The Butterfly Effect' is a well-made, gripping, but standard mind-bender. Anyone who has seen 'Back To The Future' or 'Doctor Who' or any other number of time-traveling movies and shows will be in more or less familiar territory. It's the ending that elevates this movie to the sphere of greatness. Oh, by the way, I'm talking about the director's cut ending. It's one of the most powerful endings I've seen, both emotionally (it gave me shivers), and intellectually (the way it ties in to the seemingly 'throwaway' revelation of the previous stillbirths is so simple and yet so ingenious). Apparently there are multiple different endings out there, including the theatrical one. Which does make sense, as the director's cut ending is extremely bold and un-Hollywood-like, though the movie would be so much less without it. My *** out of 4 rating applies only to the director's cut version.",7,1,2,13 October 2015
To Rome With Love," A disappointment from Woody Allen
","The opening sequence of this film filled me with hope....Rome, probably my favorite city in the world, seen through the awestruck eyes of Woody Allen....unfortunately, until the equally magnificent closing scene, he doesn't really make Rome an integral part of his stories....of course there are a few token references to the Collosseum and the Vatican, but also a few too many interior shots. Woody himself, at age 77, is still the funniest performer in the film, AND of course he gives himself most of the best lines as well ('He does it for pleasure, not for money' - 'Well, there is a lot of pleasure IN money'!). But while his segment is pretty funny, it's also basically one-joke. The segment with the Italian couple moving to the big city begins well and the couple is appealing, but it goes astray when it turns into a story of double infidelity; this could have been handled either as an all-out farce or as a serious drama, but Allen seems, rather disagreeably, to imply that the whole incident was beneficial to the couple! Nevertheless, this segment includes the three loveliest women in the film, the adorable up-and-coming Alessandra Mastronardi, the getting-hotter-every-year Penelope Cruz, and a cameo by the ageless Ornella Muti! (she should have had a bigger part). The segment with the American couple who find their relationship tested by the arrival of the girl's uninhibited best female friend feels mostly artificial and unconvincing - perhaps because Ellen Page never quite succeeds in looking like a strong enough temptation for Jesse Eisenberg to abandon Gret Gerwig. As for the Roberto Benigni segment, it's pointless, unfunny and repetitive. When I saw 'Il Mostro' at the theater in the mid-1990s, the audience was roaring with laughter; during 90% of Benigni's scenes in 'To Rome With Love' the audience was dead quiet. Overall, a lightweight disappointment from Woody, though not without moments of pleasure for his fans. ** out of 4.",5,17,27,26 September 2012
Quiz Show," Lively, enormously entertaining period piece
","The mere fact that the discovery of a TV quiz show as being 'rigged' caused such a nationwide scandal in 1950s America is enough to speak volumes about the lost innocence of an era (a similar event today would barely raise an eyebrow). Robert Redford understands that, so he makes his points without hammering them across. 'Quiz Show' is, above all, great entertainment: handsome production, terrific recreation of the period, attention to detail, pacey and unstuffy direction, and quite a bit of humor. Redford's handling of his subject is remarkably even-handed (with no clear-cut 'good guys and bad guys'), and the acting is exceptional in every role, big or small (it's hard to choose a favorite performance). My biggest objection would have to be Ron Morrow's sometimes overdone accent - which is hardly a major complaint! *** out of 4.",7,1,1,4 February 2016
Total Recall," Schwarznegger's most intellectual movie; also a crowd-pleaser
","This is probably my second-favorite Arnold movie, after the first 'Terminator'. It has non-stop (and well-staged) action, splattery violence, pitch-black humor, classic one-liners, impressive special and makeup effects....but also a well-constructed, puzzle-like story that plays with concepts of memory, identity and reality, a pointed political allegory, and a perfect pace with virtually no lulls. Whenever I watch this movie I always feel like this IS Mars (and not Mexico!); I also think Sharon Stone was sexier here than in 'Basic Instinct'. A crowd-pleaser which also gets you thinking - you don't get that very often. *** out of 4.",7,3,4,21 September 2017
Rocky III," Thoroughly predictable but very entertaining
","If awards were given for entertaining surface and not artistic depth, then surely Mr.T would win many for his awesomely over-the-top performance here ('Don't turn your back on me, sucka!'). And his punches (especially in the first match) look like they have the force of one ton each. Stallone's script is thoroughly predictable and by-the-numbers, but his direction is energized and he keeps the film going at a relentless pace. In some ways, from Hulk Hogan in a redundant but fun sequence to the all-time-classic 'Eye Of The Tiger', 'Rocky III' is one of the quintessential 1980s films. And the slow-motion bouncing and hugging at the beach between Stallone and Weathers belongs in the annals of camp! **1/2 out of 4.",6,3,4,23 September 2017
The Untouchables," Immensely entertaining
","For a director who has built his reputation mostly on Hitchcockian thrillers, Brian De Palma has actually made some of his best (and most famous) films in the gangster genre: 'Scarface' (fun on a trashy, guilty-pleasure level), 'Carlito's Way' (both visually and emotionally compelling, and perhaps his greatest all-around achievement), and 'The Untouchables'. This film is shallow in content, but it shows De Palma at the peak of his powers; it has one unforgettable scene after another. Kevin Costner, or maybe Eliot Ness himself, is too stiff and too square, but that doesn't seem to matter, because Sean Connery is so commanding, and because Robert De Niro steals every scene he is in as the flamboyant, sardonic Al Capone (how he never even got an Oscar nomination I'll never understand). The production design is spectacular and Ennio Morriccone's pulsating score is fantastic - among his greatest. This movie is a modern classic. ***1/2 out of 4.",8,7,10,18 December 2016
Murder on the Orient Express," Enjoyable up to a point, but cannot touch the 1974 version
","I have watched the 1974 'Murder On The Orient Express' at least 7 times, and although not my favorite Hercule Poirot film, it is one with great replay value. The 2010 episode of the David Suchet series suffers by comparison, and so does this latest remake. As a director, Kenneth Brannagh has some visual ideas (a shot near the end deliberately recalls The Last Supper) and orchestrates some impressively fluid camera movements, but he botches the most iconic sequence of the original (the ritualistic re-construction of the crime), and he adds unnecessary 'modernisms' (Poirot in physical action). As Poirot, he is rather unconvincing, but you get used to him; none of the other cast members stand out the way, for example, John Gielgud and Wendy Hiller stood out in the original (Daisy Ridley comes closest). The film has sweeping production values, but is short on atmosphere and detective work. I enjoyed parts of it, and will probably add it to my Agatha Christie collection, but it really is a runner-up. **1/2 out of 4.",6,6,13,16 November 2017
The Cannonball Run," A big hit, but very disappointing
","Literally half the movie is over before we even get to the race; most of the comedy is dreadful, if not depressing (the Dean Martin scenes), and there is surprisingly little action as well. You could take some admittedly nice stunts (but as I said, way too few for this kind of picture when they are the main reason for its existence), the jaw-dropping cleavage of Adrienne Barbeau & Tara Buckman (bonus: Vickie Reigle as a drive thru girl), a brief display of agile martial arts by Jackie Chan, and Roger Moore parodying his Bond persona, and make a decent 10-minute action reel out of this movie. *1/2 out of 4.",4,0,0,11 May 2020
Centurion," Visceral (anti-)war epic
","All guts, no glory: that seems to be the message of Neil Marshall's 'Centurion'. Although the splattery battle scenes are its main selling point, it is also one of the most uncompromisingly anti-war films I have ever seen. It doesn't just say that war is futile; it says that was is death. You are asked to leave your humanity behind and become a killing machine, and then you most likely end up dead anyway, one more anonymous 'number' for the history books. There are no 'good' or 'bad' sides, either; the story is mostly told from the perspective of the Romans, of course, but both they and the Picts are trapped in an endless cycle of violence (the parallels with contemporary wars are so obvious that they don't even need to be stated). The battle scenes are not entirely free of the trendy quick-cutting/blurry-editing syndrome, however Marshall is to be commended for avoiding CGI and using old-school, practical effects instead. The big battle where the Ninth Legion gets nearly annihilated is a bit too chaotic (yes, I realize that a real battle during that era would be pretty much exactly like that), but the 'last stand' fight at the abandoned fort near the end is genuinely exciting - it has a definite 'Do or Die' feel to it. Add points for some eye-filling panoramic shots of hills, valleys, forests and rivers; subtract points for the sometimes too-contemporary dialogue ('Your mother must have had a great sense of humor' - 'She was a f*****g comedian!'). Although the frenetic pacing (especially in the first half) doesn't allow for much character development (beyond a few 'bonding' scenes), Michael Fassbender gives a very strong performance as the lead. Olga Kurylenko is fixating (with 'Centurion', 'Quantum of Solace' and her still-unreleased female assassin film 'Kirot', she is becoming quite the dedicated action actress; her skill with the spear in particular in this movie is very impressive); Ulrich Thomsen is powerful as the leader of the Picts; Imogen Poots is extremely lovely as perhaps the only ray of hope in this world; Dominic West, despite his second billing, has very little to do. **1/2 out of 4.",6,7,16,28 April 2010
Carrie," Unsurprising but sensational thriller
","Even if you have never read Stephen King's book or seen any of the sequels / remakes, 'Carrie' holds few surprises. Basically, if you've seen the 3-minute trailer, you've seen most of the film. Even if you don't see the trailer, the movie itself telegraphs early on approximately what is going to happen. But the movie is still worth seeing, primarily for three reasons: Brian De Palma's direction (he is a genius with the camera), and the performances of Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie (Amy Irving is also terrific in one of her earliest roles): Spacek should have won the Oscar for her extraordinary, sensitive, chameleonic, scary interpretation, and Laurie makes one of the most terrifying villains in movie history - maybe because she is so single-minded and devoted to her 'cause'. There are some inexplicably poor scenes (those with John Travolta and Nancy Allen - a far cry from their work in De Palma's later 'Blow Out'), but the prom climax is worth the wait, the confrontation between Carrie and her mother is unnerving, and the shock ending is effective. *** out of 4.",7,0,2,17 April 2016
Cloud Atlas," Riveting for nearly three hours
","In an era where most films released in the theaters are sequels, remakes, or involve superheros and teenagers, a cosmic epic like 'Cloud Atlas' is a massive undertaking and a wonderful folly. It's an uneven journey, but also a fascinating, challenging, intelligent, imaginative one. The filmmakers incorporate many different genres (nautical adventure, period drama, spy thriller, comedy, futuristic sci-fi, etc.) and the film is alternately funny, sad, heartwarming, violent and exciting. It's also a triumph of production design and makeup (only a few of the digital special effects look fake), and a great showcase for the versatility of several actors who play multiple characters. *** out of 4.",7,2,3,7 August 2016
Spectre," Not a classic, but my favorite of the Craig Bonds
","I haven't been the biggest fan of the Daniel Craig James Bond films, but 'Spectre', while flawed, is my favorite of his four on the whole. It's the first one that pits Bond against a villain of his own stature and a henchman of superior strength, the first one that makes him look vulnerable or like he's in any danger. It's also more jam-packed with action and less heavy on the psychodrama than the overrated 'Skyfall'; psychoanalysis is still there, but done in a more discreet way (like in the scene where Bond is 'interrogating' a mouse). There are flaws: an atrocious title song, an underdeveloped love story, some illogical moments. But there are also some great scenes, like Bond landing on a couch, the train fight, or the final three minutes which really do bring Craig's Bond full-circle and send you out of the theater with a big grin on your face. The cast is terrific (Craig is rather blasè in this one, but also more relaxed than usual), and I wouldn't mind seeing some key players of this film return in Bond 25. All in all, an entertaining Bond epic. *** out of 4.",7,7,12,18 November 2015
