The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Worth watching!
","Not your average coming-of-age teen movie!Stephen Chbosky's novel 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' marks malls and search engine results even before it was released. The trailer alone is already making a buzz in and around the media. Emma Watson's face caught my attention at first glance on it aside from the apple green background.Since it is an adaptation, I find it quite rare to hear good reviews from people who have read the novel. It is about 15-year-old Charlie, an endearing and naive outsider, coping with first love Sam, the suicide of his best friend, and his own mental illness while struggling to find a group of people with whom he belongs. The introvert freshman is taken under the wings of two seniors, Sam and her step-brother Patrick who welcome him to the real world â€“new experiences, new friends, music, and drugs.",9,1,2,27 July 2016
