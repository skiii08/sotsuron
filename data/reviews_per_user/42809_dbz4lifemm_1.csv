United 93," very REAL, emotional, intense... WELL DONE!
","OK, first off let's get one thing straight here... When Americans do something stupid (which under the Bush administration seems to be more often than not it seems - and YES I can blame the average American for Bush's actions... YOU VOTED HIM IN A SECOND TIME DARNIT!!!, although I KNOW, I KNOW it was a close election... but still!), I am readily glad to blast them on whatever stupid thing they've done this time. But this movie was profoundly REAL and moving and immensely well done, and is NOT AT ALL portrayed as some macho-American patriotic garbage. IF IT WAS, BELIEVE ME I WOULD BE ONE OF THE FIRST TO BLAST THE CRAP OUT OF IT!!! *I believe this movie stayed true and tried to portray (and DID portray) as accurately as possible (with the knowledge and evidence we know and have today) the events of that day as they unfolded... It was scary, intense, emotional, and VERY REAL!!! One of the most interesting scenes i think is when you see the passengers on the plane praying the 'hail marry' and 'our father' prayers (christianity) because they are scared they might die, while AT THE SAME TIME the hijackers (Muslims) are saying their prayers to Allah because they think they are doing righteous work (or whatever). I thought this was VERY poignant. The things humans do, say, and act upon (ON ALL SIDES!) all in the name of 'THIER GOD' I think is total bullshit period!!! Allah doesn't want Muslims to commit murder and blow themselves and innocent bystanders up, and Jesus doesn't want Catholics to go on crusades and try and convert the world!!! Give me a *$%^ing break!!! Get a life everyone!!! Anyways, in terms of the movie... WELL DONE! 5 *'s Peace.",7,3,8,7 May 2006
