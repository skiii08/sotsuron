Walk the Line," great movie
",I Love this movie...great acting...great singing...I did not want it to end....Academy Award caliber performance..!!!!!!! I will buy this DVD..!!!!The acting was sensational as was the singing...What a love story... I always liked J. Phoenix but I like him even more now...Reese Witherspoon did such a fine job too and I understand they did their own singing....I got the chills every time He said ' Hi I'am Johhny Cash'...I was very impressed how he won his battle with drugs and alcohol and stayed clean for the next 35 years...This is truly a love story and a true story of Love and devotion..I can't wait to see it again!!,10,0,1,25 November 2005
