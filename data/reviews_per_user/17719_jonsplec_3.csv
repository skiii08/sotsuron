Kill Bill: Vol. 2," What a film!
","You know the story by now and this part two of Tarrantinos Kill Bill Series.I loved this film not quite as much as Volume 1 due to the fact the final chapter with Bill drags on a little too much for my liking.Another great soundtrack,this films oozes cool and stands up there with Pulp Fiction in my view.Micheal Madsen delivers another great performance as does Gordon Liu who plays Pei Mei,possibly my favourite character from Kill Bill.If you have not seen this film,go and see it.......NOW!",9,1,2,11 May 2004
The Football Factory," Gritty,grim but enjoyable
","This film follows a group of the Chelsea football hooligan squad andfocuses on main character Tommy Johnson(danny dyer)as he starts to have second thoughts about whether he still wants to continue this 'hobby'.I must admit i have not read the book so i didn't really know what to expect,the first 5 minutes loud banging music and people getting beat up and dialogue filled with c words and f words,i wasn't impressed.Then the film took turn for the better,you started to learn about the characters,their backrounds and the storyline started to take shape.Frank Harper(plays the Dog in Lockstock)plays a superb and very convincing support to Dyer and leaves you actually scared of him. From then on the film was a joy to watch and I would highly recommend those who love ID,Snatch,Lock Stock et al to go and see it.The violence is my opinion wasn't that bad,it was grim but i have seen worse on CCTV cameras across Britain.If your fans on the above films it ain't worse than them.Coupled with a great soundtrack,the Streets,the Jam,the Libertines all feature here and a great ending,this film gets a big fat 8!",8,0,1,19 May 2004
The Shawshank Redemption," Like Bernard Matthews Turkey Drummers--Bootiful!
","I had heard this film was good and saw it sat at number 2 in the top 250 and appears in many all time great films top five list.You could say myexpectations were a little high.This sort of thing can spoil a film,you expect a lot and it doesn't deliver,mainly due to the fact you listened to the word on the street and were let down.It Shawshanks case,however,this was NOT the case.I have been putting off watching this film for years,don't know why, just one of those films I never got round to watching,what i didn't know was a 'classic','epic' was gathering dust on my shelf and i didn't know it.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are superb and not many films get me choked at the end,didn't quite get me but it was sure close!This film is a feel good film,an unlikely one maybe and tinged with sadness but all the more reason to watch,i'll be watching it again I can assure you that.",10,0,0,26 May 2004
