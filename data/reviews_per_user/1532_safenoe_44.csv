The Rock," The Rock rocks
","What an incredible ending The Rock had. You had a mutiny within a mutiny, and the action scenes at the end were incredible big time. The rocket man scene was something, and I wonder if North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has this in his DVD collection, given reports in 2015 that he executed a sleepy official with an anti-aircraft gun.The ending had a racist character, a soldier from the mutiny who made a disparaging remark against Sean Connery's character who is English. The soldier's father was Irish, but really Sean Connery's character was Scottish, so really there is a difference between the Scots and English folk. The Rock was made about 20 years before Nicolas Cage's starring role in Left Behind.",9,2,2,22 October 2016
The Equalizer," Amazing in its prescience of Russian meddling
","Odds against you? Need help? Indeed, the Hillary Clinton campaign could have called upon the Equalizer to battle against the Russian- led fake news in the 2016 presidential campaign. Just in case you're wondering, Miriam Webster defines prescience as 'foreknowledge of events' and it seemed this 2014 blockbuster really seemed to have its finger on the pulse when it came to the Russian gangsters who are infecting the American social fabric.I'm a huge fan of The Equalizer TV series, and this movie carries on the fine tradition that's for sure. No messing around by McCall. He gets the job done, delivers justice and rails against police corruption. Perhaps in the sequel he can also rail against the TSA agents who like to pick on minorities, and maybe McCall deliver his own kind of justice to them.Melissa Leo and Bill Pullman play former CIA operatives, and it's good to know Melissa's character can beat rush hour traffic by getting a lift home in a helicopter. It beats having to encounter the TSA brutes at the airport.",9,0,4,10 October 2017
Skyfall," Love the Tube scenes
","Whenever going through the Tube I fantasized about sliding down the long and steep escalator and taking satisfaction in the masses envying me. Here James Bond (Daniel Craig in this third outing as 007) and the evil Silva (Javier Bardem) achieve this in the Tube, and it's one of the most impressive stunts in Skyfall.I would have achieved greater satisfaction if the movie (even in the DVD outtakes) had a scene where Bardem, channeling Anton Chigurh from No Country For Old Men, swiftly despatches the arrogant commuters who attempt to push him aside to reach their platform on time, e.g. the suited people who think they can push their way through (I guess their Jaguars are being serviced) or the grumpy old guy who gets angry because he missed his train, even though the next one will arrive in 3.01 minutes.The Scottish highland scenes are stunning, although I was surprised to learn Bond's mansion was actually constructed in Surrey, in the neighboring country of England!Gareth Mallory MP, the Chairman of the House of Commons Intelligence and Security Committee, becomes the new M. I wonder if the by- election caused by Gareth's resignation from Parliament was won by the Opposition or a third party? Political intrigue at its finest. Anyway Ralph Fiennes plays Gareth, and in 2007 he made huge news when it was reported he had a mile high tryst with Qantas Flight Attendant Lisa Robertson.",8,3,5,28 July 2017
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The gold standard
","It's hard to believe Raiders was released nearly four decades ago, and it certainly doesn't age. It's one of Spielberg's best (in my humble opinion I think Duel was excellent and 1941 was grossly underrated). Anyway, buckle yourself in when you watch Raiders and be prepared to be enthralled big time. John Williams' score does the movie proud. What's fascinating is Raiders deals with themes of God and the ten commandments vs. the Nazis. Interestingly, I don't think any Germans played the Nazis, a similar pattern to Hogan's Heroes and Valkyrie, where Americans played the Nazis, and in Allo' Allo' where British actors played the Nazis. Raiders is quite riveting and suspenseful at the end.",10,0,0,5 October 2017
United 93," So suspenseful even though we know the tragic ending
","I happened to see United 93 when visiting family in a London rental apartment and given we know the tragic ending, I must admit I didn't think I could be so gripped by United 93. Maybe it's because the director and writer Paul Greengrass is British, we get a non-gung-ho but moving account of this terrorist attack. The cast doesn't have any big Hollywood names, but we still really want them to overpower the terrorists.Even in the final, gripping and horrific scene, I was hoping against hope that the brave passengers managed to land the plane. That's how convincing I thought the acting was. I mean, when I watched the Titanic (the Kate Winslet one), I just felt it was inevitable that the iceberg would prevail, but in United 93 I really thought that just maybe in an alternative universe where Gore won the Miami recount in 2000, the terrorists would be overcome by the heroic Americans.",9,0,1,9 September 2016
Memento," This deserves more than one viewing
","I am a huge fan of Memento, and I loved going through the DVD specials! Memento requires much thought and concentration. If you're into fast and furious cars, or transformer toys or police academy flicks, then please vacate your cinema seat now. Please.Each time I watch Memento I usually learn something new, and even if I don't, I'm transfixed by Christopher Nolan's directing, and the acting is outstanding. Guy Pearce (an Australian actor who puts on a convincing US accent) is spot-on in his role, and also Carrie-Anne Moss, who got her break in TV in Dark Justice.I can imagine a bold visionary coming up with a Memento TV series, but maybe the movie stands alone had and shoulders above most others.",10,1,3,7 November 2016
Home Alone," One of the best Christmas movies (a close second to Die Hard).
","Angels with Filthy Souls...when I first saw Home Alone I thought this black and white gangster movie that inspires Kevin was a real movie!! But I recently found out it wasn't, and much effort into making the clip as authentic as possible. Vanity Fair did a great write-up of the making of Angels of Filthy Souls in the article 'Inside the Making of ​ Home Alone​'s Fake Gangster Movie' by Darryn King, which was published online on 22 Dec '15.Sure, Home Alone may not fit into the traditional canon (no girl wistfully wishing for a house on 34th Street) but it's one of my favorite Christmas movies next to Die Hard of course. In a way, Home Alone and Die Hard share similar themes of survival against the vicious criminals, with the hero using his wits and ingenuity to fight back and ensure the crooks get their just desserts.",10,13,16,18 December 2016
Lost in Translation," It is what it is
","A lot has been written about the alleged cultural insensitivity or even racism towards Japanese in Lost in Translation, but really, Lost in Translation is what it is. Lost in Translation was written and directed by Italian-American Sofia 'The Godfather Part III' Coppola (who is related to Nic Cage). Sofia has every right to write and direct her movie how she sees fit for better or worse, even if she perpetuates stereotypes and so on.If say a Japanese filmmaker wrote and directed a movie about a Japanese actor taking up a lucrative advertising job in the USA, the filmmaker can be forgiven if there are stereotypes about obese and loud Americans. Or if the film was set in the UK, there would be stereotypes about Brits with bad teeth and so on if you know what i mean.",6,0,1,10 January 2017
Lion," Dev Patel's Indian trilogy
","I was just thinking Lion is the final in the Indian trilogy movie for Dev Patel. The first was Slumdog Millionaire, and the second was the Exotic Marigold movies (1 and 2) and the third is Lion. Lion is an incredibly moving movie sans Bollywood dancing, and the film making really conveys the themes in an emotional manner.Sure, some naysayers may think this movie is an ad. for Google Earth, and yes Saroo (sic) really did use Google Earth to track down his mother, but Google Earth wasn't a focus of this fine movie. One thing I learned is that people in Tasmania have access to Google.The atmosphere in India is amazing, and kudos to the director of cinematography for capturing the daily life and grind of India.",9,0,0,14 July 2017
The Bourne Ultimatum," Waterloo, the Guardian, and Bourne...just as Facebook became a presence, and Twitter was invented
","When Bourne I was released, there was no Facebook an Twitter. With Bourne III, Facebook became a world presence, and Twitter was one year old believe it or not, and the junior senator from Illinois was about to boldly declare his nomination to be the Democratic Party in the 2008 presidential election. Still, the CIA could still track Bourne without Twitter.The London Waterloo scenes are impressively shot, and I wondered how it was done. You can read about it in The Independent article 'Paul Greengrass admits tricking commuters during Bourne Ultimatum filming'. During the filming I saw some bystanders pointing to Bourne. It's Matt Damon!!!Also impressive were the scenes in New York City. THe Big Apple comes alive with Jason Bourne. One poignant scene was where Julia Stiles' Nicky Parsons has a hairdo while on the run, that painfully reminds Bourne of his murdered German girlfriend (Franka Potente), who appears in a flashback in this movie.Who would have thought that Bourne would return a decade later in Jason Bourne?",10,0,0,2 August 2017
The Bourne Identity," Two years before Facebook and so on...welcome Jason Bourne
","It's interesting to reflect on Bourne I and how social media was in its infancy, and then full blown by the time Jason Bourne was released in 2016. Here there are no CIA close-up shots of Jason running through the streets of beautiful Paris, getting dressed, utilizing his mobile, and so on. It's sort of gumshoe surveillance for the times, 2002.There's full blown plot and action in Bourne I, and I was impressed big time. If you need Bourne to sort out a dispute for you, he won't let you down.Bourne I was released in the era of Bush II and Blair, and by the time we get to Jason Bourne in 2016, Trump is on the brink of being elected to the White House.",9,1,1,18 July 2017
21," It is what it is...the book was better
","If I watch a movie based on a book, I prefer to see it before reading. Here's a movie I watched after reading Ben Mezrich's Bringing Down the House, and I wish it was vice-versa. The book was compelling but the movie was sort of okay, and I guess it tried to be a piece of art on its own.Much has been made about the 'whitewashing' of the cast, as some of the real life college students in Ben's book are of Chinese descent. The accusations of whitewashing are fair enough, and it's a shame the cast wasn't more reflective of the real life characters. But hey, Hollywood is unfortunately replete with such whitewashing type examples. Valkyrie I don't think had any Germans in the cast. It was pretty much Americans and Brits playing Germans. The director wasn't German! Also in Schindler's List, same deal, no Germans in the lead roles. Similarly, Hogan's Heroes didn't have any Germans in the cast - in fact quite ironically some of the Nazis were played by Jewish actors. Also in in 'Allo 'Allo, no Germans were featured - all Brits played the Germans. Nary a German actor in Raiders of the Lost Ark. So unfortunately Germans are being whitewashed out of casting roles sadly.",5,0,0,1 October 2016
Apocalypse Now," The Sympathizer (by Viet Thanh Nguyen) is the antidote to Apocalypse Now
","Francis Ford Coppola is a distinguished director and a man of letters, and I'd be interested to see if The Sympathizer, the Pulitzer Prize winning book by Viet Thanh Nguyen, features prominently on his bookshelf. The book, published in 2015, was a reposte to Apocalypse Now, which in itself is an impressive movie in many respects.Anyone who said that history is written by the victors has never watched Apocalypse Now or any other movie in the 'Vietnam' genre from our great shores. Funny that no WWI movies pumped out from the USA are called 'Germany' movies.Anyway, one of my favorite scenes is the restored scene where Captain Willard broke bread with a French family running a plantation in Vietnam, representing the vestiges of French colonialism (who did well to teach the Vietnamese to do decent bakery).",6,0,4,6 November 2016
In the Name of the Father," I wonder what the Irish perspective is...
","I found In the name of the Father very moving and it made you wonder about how many miscarriages of justice there were in the war on the IRA. I remember mentioning how much I liked this movie to an Irish guy and he really had harsh words to say about ITNOTF. I don't know if the Irish guy was Irish Republic Irish or Northern Ireland Irish. But on first glance I wonder how to tell them apart? Also how do you tell apart the Protestants and Catholics? The New York Times reviewer of the theater performance 'Quietly', which deals with the troubles, wondered 'how did the enemies tell one another apart?'Good question indeed, and I guess they were able to unite and form a unity/coalition government in Northern Ireland after all. Maybe the troubles are less troublesome, so that's a good outcome after watching ITNOTF.Corin Redgrave was impressive in the role of UK police officer Robert Dixon, who I believe is a composite of police officers. Robert really was politically incorrect when it came to his service to the public.",7,1,1,24 September 2016
Gandhi," The South African part
","I would have liked to have seen more of the movie focus on Mahatma Gandhi's attempt to fight for the rights of native blacks in South Africa. I know much has been written about Gandhi's alleged lack of empathy towards native blacks in South Africa, but maybe a prequel can be made to address these concerns. Given Gandhi's fight for justice for all, I just cannot imagine he would have disregarded the human rights of black natives in South Africa.Anyway, kudos to Ben Kingsley (who was excellent in Sneakers) and also of course to the director. It would be interesting to know how the movie was received in India. I know that Slumdog Millionaire, a British movie, wasn't exactly well received in India.",7,0,0,4 November 2016
Zulu," The unsung heroes...and it reminds me of...
","I couldn't but help be reminded of Starship Troopers when I saw Zulu, with the protagonists defending themselves against the enemy attempting to swarm their headquarters. This movie was Michael Caine's breakout movie, well before he was Albert in the Dark Knight trilogy several decades later.I wish there was another movie about the unsung heroes of Zulu. I'm thinking of the support staff who kept the British uniforms clean and crisp amidst the daily battle of war, the chefs who keep up the soldiers' appetites after a hard day defending the fort, the doctors, so many people who play a role behind the scenes. How did the regular food supply get replenished? What did the British soldiers eat for breakfast? A Full English breakfast?",8,1,2,9 September 2016
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Magnificent splendor
","One of my friends saw this at a university film club and at the end everyone gave the movie a standing ovation. It's one of those films, and makes you appreciate the quality of film making amidst the flotsam and jetsam and supposedly constitutes films today (looking at you Fast and the Furious).I was captivated by this, and loved the director's commentary, which is worth the price admission alone. With today's anti-Chinese hysteria in the 2016 US presidential election, you wonder how Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon would play out in the multiplexes, but this movie will endure longer than any presidency gone wrong.",8,0,0,29 September 2016
Schindler's List," This ain't Hogan's Heroes...
","...nor is it Allo' Allo' or The Producers. Schindler's List deserves viewing especially in light of the 2016 election, and it's an antidote to the light-hearted and even jocular view of Nazis and their role in the Holocaust. If you're expecting Hogan's Heroes, then please give up your seat for someone else.This movie should be on any school curriculum but I'm afraid the politically correct forces will oppose it.",10,42,75,12 October 2017
Gran Torino," This is going to sound politically incorrect...
","I'm sorry if this sounds politically incorrect, but I cannot get on the merry-go-round and give this movie the acclamation it has received. If this was a made-for-TV movie then I'd give this a higher rating. And I'm not giving this a low rating because of Clint's talking chair rant at the 2012 GOP Convention that nominated Mitt Romney.I can think of numerous Eastwood movies that contained more insight but Gran Torino was pretty much by the numbers, and rather grossly stereotypical. Walt was stereotypical, the Hmong community stereotypical. I even read that the Hmong cast weren't even invited to a cast and crew baseball match, because it was assumed they wouldn't be interested in baseball even though all were born in the USA to paraphrase Bruce Springsteen. Really, does Walt hate all Asians because of his Korean War experience? Following that chilling line of thought, if Walt had fought the Germans in World War 2, he'd end up hating every European person he came across!!!!",4,4,8,26 November 2016
Donnie Brasco," The first of the Donnie series
","Donnie Brasco kicked off the Donnie series in 1997, with Donnie Darko following four years later. One morbid scene was the much-discussed Japanese restaurant where Donnie and his cronies beat up the maitre'd because he insisted Donnie remove his shoes. I wonder what the casting call was for this, an actor of Asian appearance, preferably nerdy and flabby looking, willing to take a few blows for verisimilitude. I mean really, thankfully Donnie and his cronies didn't take their anger to a McDonald's lest Ronald be beaten up in the presence of Mayor McCheese and the rest of the McDonald's gang. Really, can you imagine if this incident had taken place in a German beerhouse? I don't think so...I imagine the beefy ultra-nationalists in the beerhouse wouldn't take any crap from Brasco et al.",1,1,15,20 July 2017
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Jonah Hill 2, Jim Carrey 0
","If Jonah Hill had Jim Carrey's role in this fine movie, you can imagine the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences would have fallen over themselves to bestow on him an acting nomination, and it would have been Jonah Hill 3, Jim Carrey 0.Why Mr Carrey did not get an Oscar nomination for his impressive performance in this fine movie is a mystery for the ages. Why oh why? I believe Mr Carrey was denied a nomination for his outstanding performance in The Truman Show. Oh dear. Anyway, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is in incredibly movie that really gets emotional at times, and makes you think about the nature of memories and the nature of love.",10,0,1,26 November 2016
Taken," Helicopter parenting to the extreme...loved it!
","Wow, what a visceral feeling this movie provoked. There was a sense of foreboding when Kim Mills and her friend decided to head off to France, and you know her father Bryan (Liam Neeson rebooted big time) would be getting on the next plane to Paris to sort things out and find Kim.Sure, the movie was violent, but it had a meaning and you knew the bad guys deserved it big time, and Bryan deals it out in spades without any moral reservations. I read that when Liam signed on for this role, he thought it would be a straight to video/DVD release, but he took it on to spend time in Paris and brush up on his mixed martial arts. He does not disappoint, and the box office numbers did not disappoint.Holly Valance plays a key role in the intro and conclusion, and it's good she's doing well in her career. I don't think Holly is related to the late and great Jack Valance.",10,1,1,10 September 2016
Victory," Inspiring, especially for football fans
","Victory is unique in that star football players pretty much play themselves in a World War 2 setting, up against the ruthless efficiency of the Nazi football machine. Pele is for me one of the recognizable superstars, and you see others from Western Europe (sans Germany of course) that constitute the Allies.One stomach churning scene was when one of the players allowed his arm to be broken by his fellow teammates, so Sylvester 'Rocky' Stallone's character could return to the team. The sound effect for the arm breaking scene is something I'll never forget.If Victory is remade, they've got a whole suite of stars from Europe and Asia to join a stellar cast. As for the German/Nazi team, if the German football players aren't available (for fear of offending their fan base I guess), then they can get the British and American actors who portrayed the Nazis in Valkyrie.",6,0,0,18 December 2016
Total Recall," 'I'll see you at the party!!'
","Wow, so many visceral moments in this movie that somehow was robbed of an Oscar for best motion picture.One scene that really stands out big time is when Michael Ironside loses his hands on the lift, you see Arnie's character grasping onto Michael's hands, and then they get sliced off, and Michael falling to his death. Arnie says deadpan, 'I'll see you at the party!!'Talking about the party, I wonder what was the fate of Ronny Cox's character after his face got all mangled? Did he actually survive and repent? Or what?Sharon Stone makes a supporting role appearance. This was before she hit it big time in Basic Instinct.",8,0,1,18 September 2016
Shine," Incredible performances from all the cast - especially Chris Haywood
","Much has been said about Geoffrey Rush's incredible performance as David Helfgott, which launched him in the Hollywood stratosphere, but special mention must go to Chris Haywood as Sam, the owner of the Moby's, the restaurant where David really shines big time with his Rachmaninov. Noah Taylor as the adolescent David is a standout, and it's good to see him make it big in Hollywood. I must admit I sometimes get Noah mixed up with Ben Mendelsohn, a fellow Australian actor, and they do share some resemblance.Good to see Lynn Redgrave as David's wife. Lynn was excellent in the TV series House Calls co-starring with Wayne Rogers.",9,0,0,10 January 2017
Pretty Woman," Serenity now!! Serenity now!!!
","I'd like to think Pretty Movie launched Jason Alexander's career, but at the very least it rebooted Richard Gere as a Hollywood megastar, and introduced us to Eric Robert's sister Julia. Anyway, Jason will forever be associated with Seinfeld, which came on the heels of Jason's star turn as the sycophantic corporate lawyer who tried to do awful things to Julia Robert's character.Anyway, it's time for a sequel, where Jason's character evolves into a high profile alt-right leader, bitter about events almost three decades earlier, playing a prominent role in the 2016 presidential election and beyond.",8,0,1,23 August 2017
The Untouchables," Powerful, moving, compelling
","Whilst I don't agree with all of David Mamet's politics, but he wrote an excellent movie. I love The Untouchables and David Manet's poetry underscores the lines throughout the movie.Sure there was violence, but it was operatic nonetheless and in the context of good vs. evil in the prohibition era.The pram scene on the railway station tracks was amazing and suspenseful. You wondered if the baby would survive. I know it was based on Battleship Potemkin, and wow, it was well shot. I'd love to see on the DVD extras the technical aspects of this filming. All credit to the editor also.",9,2,3,11 March 2016
Die Hard," Die Hard is the original and the best:)
","Die Hard is the one. Sure it may not be a traditional date movie, but if you want to be perked up in the midst of injustice in the world, then Die Hard is for you. It's more than an action movie. It's a movie with heart and a dose of humor. Also it had engaging African- American actors in key roles, so kind of ahead of its time in a way. Alan Rickman should have won an Oscar for his role as Hans, and his German accent is impressive even though he's English.",10,1,1,19 September 2017
Zero Dark Thirty," Drawn out...could have been more compelling
","One of my relatives raved on about Zero Dark Thirty so I thought it would be a 9/11 movie worth watching. Paul Greengrass's United 93 was absolutely compelling, so in a way Zero Dark Thirty would represent the bookend with (spoiler alert) the death of Osama bin Laden.I thought I was the only viewer who thought this, but it really was drawn out big time. Okay, the movie had a decade to cover before the assassination of bin Laden in Pakistan (near a West Point-type military base believe it or not), but maybe the movie needed Jason Bourne or Brad Cooper to move things along to the denouement.One thing Zero Dark Thirty glossed over was the bigotry and prejudice unleashed after 9/11...the racial/religious profiling at airports for one thing, flight attendants getting all edgy and alert just because they see a passenger (who looks different if you know what I mean) reading a book about Syria. Unfortunately it continues to this day, the Indian Ambassador to the USA being given special screening treatment by the geniuses the TSA employ to keep our airports 'safe'.",4,0,2,19 August 2016
Whiplash," Worth pondering, but I wonder about the agenda...
","I Googled 'movie about drummer abused' an the top search was the IMDb listing of Whiplash. I know, I know, proponents of the tough love approach will accuse me of being soft, politically correct (the ultimate putdown) and mushy and so on. Yes, the movie was taut, tightly directed, tense and visceral, but I do wonder what agenda (if any) underlied Whiplash. Was it a sneer against the so-called 'trophy kid syndrome' which is such a tiresome cliché by the way. Or was it a movie that 'left the viewer to decide?' which is a tad sly if you ask me in my humble opinion.Sure, proponents of Whiplash will say that the movie reflects the real-life wimpiness of softies, but no way could Fletcher have gotten away with his abuse the way he did. Not real life.I wonder if there was a replacement drummer at the end after Fletcher humiliated Andrew? Also, I'm pleased JK Simmons won an Oscar for his role (when will the Academy acknowledge Jim Carrey by the way?). I'm also pleased JK Simmons is in good health, because earlier this year I was concerned that he was suffering a physical illness, with the headlines screaming about his 'sick arms'. Then upon closer reading I realised JK was pumping the iron to get very muscular arms for an upcoming role. Phew, what a relief. In this day and age of gloom, it's uplifting to hear these stories of inspiration. When innocent children are having their arms blown off in Aleppo, Syria and Cambodia, we need more updates about Mr Simmons's sick arms to distract us from news that bring us down.",7,1,3,24 September 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Birdman demands several viewings
","I happened to see Birdman on an overseas flight, and thankfully I saw it more than once on the journey, because it does require several viewings. I originally thought the movie would be a satirical look (like The Player) of the behind-the-scenes of a Broadway play, but it was more than that.I loved the cinematography and wow, I wonder how on earth the production team managed to get through some of the unbelievable scenes.I know, I know, some people may think it prudish that I'm critical of the voluminous amount of swearing in this movie, but still, the massive amounts of swearing really got in the way of a fine movie. Anyway, I never knew of anyone who left a cinema complaining, 'Gee, I wish this movie had more swearing.' The Dark Knight trilogy hardly had any swearing, and its box office didn't suffer.It's a shame Michael 'Batman' Keaton didn't win an Oscar but maybe his time will come with his role as Ray Kroc in The Founder.",8,0,1,25 November 2016
Halloween," This changed trick or treating forever
","This movie doesn't let go from the get-go, and Halloween is one of the best of the horror genre, and I'd say one of the best movies ever, alongside Remains of the Day, Sneakers, and Shakespeare in Love. Anyway, Halloween really grips you and is incredibly terrifying as Michael Myers is haunting and hunted at the same time.Donald Pleasence really rocks big time and he should have had a spin- off movie.",9,1,2,10 October 2017
Ben-Hur," Claude Heater (who played Jesus Christ) - one of the last surviving main actors of Ben-Hur
","Along with Haya Harareet, I think Claude Heater is one of the last of the surviving main cast members from Ben-Hur (1959). Quite symbolic in a way given Mr Heater's moving performance as Jesus Christ in the movie. When I saw Ben-Hur at a church gathering night a few years ago, the Pastor(who was quite conservative) told us that even though Ben-Hur is a 'Hollywood' movie, it's the one that probably came closest to honoring and glorifying the Son of God. In Ben-Hur you never see the face of Jesus Christ, and that was a deliberate choice by the director. But Claude Heater gives the emotional gravitas required for the role.Ben-Hur is a movie that stands the test of time. No wonder we say 'It's bigger than Ben-Hur' to describe something spectacular. Ben-Hur is an epic, it's spectacular, and it's moving.",10,9,12,19 March 2016
Speed," One of the best!
","Speed is one of the few movies I've seen in a cinema twice, and I'd be happy to pay to see it again.It's more than an action movie, although the action was amazing. The chemistry between Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock was crackling and so was the interplay with the rest of the bus passengers. I loved it.Dennis Hopper was incredible as the villain who had many excellent one liners, 'pop quiz!!!'. The denouement with Keanu and Dennis was something - I guess he lost his head!!I think a sequel was unnecessary and I haven't seen it. I have no plans to. Speed stands on its own.",10,1,2,11 March 2016
The Sixth Sense," Bruce Willis matures
","Bruce Willis was fantastic in Moonlighting and Die Hard, and he was excellent in The Sixth Sense, and it's interesting he recently progressed to Eli Roth's Death Wish, so I guess it's continuing in the theme of death.Yes, the twist really was something I never expected, although some viewers probably picked it from the first scene. The cast and crew were delightfully multicultural...Bruce and Haley are American, Toni Collette is Australian, Olivia Williams is British, and M Night is Indian (not native American Indian but Indian).",8,0,0,10 October 2017
Rear Window," Somewhat a precursor to the Bourne movies
","Alfred Hitchcock was way ahead of his time with this classic. Jeff Jeffries (James Stewart) plays an injured professional photographer who is housebound, leg in a cast and stuck in his wheelchair. Jeff wiles the days away being thankful he has a beautiful and elegant girlfriend who resembles Grace Kelly, and nurse Stella (played by Stella Ritter, no relation to John Ritter). Jeff also gets his telephoto lense and observes the activities of his neighbors in the apartment block and it appears he's stumbled upon a murder.When I watch Rear Window I seriously think about the Jason Bourne movies (I, II, III and V, sorry with due respect to Jeremy Renner I'm not counting IV) and how a powerful organ of government can watch every move thanks to uber-technology and mobile phones. It's like Rear Window wherever you are in the world.",8,0,2,11 August 2016
Munich," München: Two Aussies headline this gripping Spielberg drama
","Eric Bana (real name Eric Banadinovic) and Geoffrey Rush headline this emotional and gripping feature from Steven 'E.T.' Spielberg. Eric started his career in Australia as a comedian, and Geoffrey was a dramatic actor before hitting it big with Shine.All credit to the production team for recreating the 70s look in this drama, based on real events it must be said. It seemed no expense was spared in getting the 70s look. I wonder though if Munich was a German production (it would be called München) what tone it would take.Daniel Craig (pre-Bond) is a standout in this compelling movie, and it's as though Munich primed Mr Craig to be 007, who wouldn't be afraid to go to Tripoli to achieve his goals on behalf of the Government.Sure there are a duplicity of complex moral issues in Munich (Germans know it as München). Interestingly, the title of the movie, the name of the city that hosted the 1972 Summer Olympics resonates to the point that the title of the movie is just that, Munich, not something like a verb.The end scene where Avner (Eric Bana) has sex with his wife, intercut with scenes of the gruesome deaths of the Israeli hostages on the Munich air strip at the hands of the terrorists, was I'm afraid ludicrous and tacky in my humble opinion. I'm surprised no- one exercised any veto on this. I mean really, it would be akin to John and Laura being the beast with two backs in Don't Look Now, intercut with whatever gruesome occurs in the movie, or Nick Curran banging Catherine Tramell in Basic Instinct, intercut with scenes of Johnny Boz being ice-picked to death. I can only wonder what the relatives of the Israeli hostages thought when they saw this scene. If aliens, well more specifically E.T. were to land on earth and watch the Munich sex scene for the first time, they would get a rather grossly distorted view of sex amongst humans I guess.Sadly this fine movie airbrushed the very insignificant event of Mossad's revenge going tragically too far by murdering the wrong person, a Moroccan-born waiter named Ahmed Bouchiki, who had no part at all in the events at Munich.",8,0,2,4 November 2016
Heat," One of Michael Mann's best
","I've seen a few of Michael Mann's movies...Manhunter (the original Silence of the Lambs), The Insider, Collateral. Heat has to be one of the best. A lot's been said about Heat, but there are a few standouts. Dennis Haybert plays Donald Breedon, out on parole and is hired by a crooked diner owner (Bud Cort - good to see him acting). When Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) recruits Breedon to be the getaway driver, you feel a sense of foreboding. But good to see Dennis end up playing the President of the USA a few years later.The final scene between Val Kilmer's character and Ashley Judd's character was very moving even though no words are exchanged. Their facial expressions alone are enough, and it's quite moving.The shootout scene has to be one of the best ever in movie history. With all the death, damage and destruction done, I can only wonder the headache this caused to the insurers in the storyline.",9,3,5,16 September 2016
Cube," Alderson was the man
","I'm very impressed that Cube has 700 user reviews on IMDb (I guess mine will be no. 701). It's one of those movies that elicits much reaction, and it's one of those movies that sticks in your mind well after you see it.Alderson unfortunately didn't get enough screen time, being 'cubed' in the opening scene which was terrifying and really got you off your cinema seat. Alderson didn't know what hit him, and I wonder if even for a few seconds he was alive after being sliced and diced unexpectedly? Anyway, maybe there should be a prequel which deals with the Alderson backstory. Kind of like Cube: Rogue One or something like that.",8,0,2,17 December 2016
Slumdog Millionaire," It ain't a family movie, but still compelling - jai ho. But Shankar/Ehsaan/Loy missing
","Some people may think Slumdog Millionaire is an uplifting family movie based on some of the marketing. Yes it's uplifting in some ways, but hardly a family movie. If you're thinking of taking your kids to see Slumdog Millionaire, beware.The opening interrogation scene was in Hindi but the language was full of expletives unbeknownst to viewers who don't understand Hindi.The song Jai Ho was amazing. But I was surprised that the famous Indian film composer trio Shankar/Ehsaan/Loy weren't invited to contribute to the soundtrack. I've always wondered where the hotel scene was filmed.The ending was actually uplifting despite all the death and drama. The dancing at Mumbai central railway station was uplifting - Jai Ho!",8,0,2,11 March 2016
The Social Network," Should have been a contender
","The King's Speech rode the crest of a sentimental wave at the Oscars, and I wonder if the presenter read the wrong winner. Well, at the very least The Social Network should have won Best Picture but I guess it was too gritty and politically incorrect compared to the politically correct and soft King's Speech if you know what I mean.The performances were incredibly powerful and insightful, and very operatic in a Sorkin kind of way which we expect from the master of the written word.Perhaps there should be motion pictures based on the rise and fall of MySpace, Flickr (!), del.icio.us, Google+, Digg, Google Wave.",9,0,0,31 August 2017
The Wedding Singer," Lays on the 80s thick...and I love it!
","I love The Wedding Singer and Adam Sandler plays such a sweet lead role who is incredibly lovable, and I guess this movie constituted Drew Barrymore's comeback again, shedding her E.T. stereotype once and for all. The 80s references come thick and fast, and Billy Idol's appearance was a classic big time. I wonder if there will be a remake of The Wedding Singer and whether it brings it forward to the 90s or the 00s even?",8,1,3,11 September 2017
The Bourne Supremacy," Top notch Bourne (Webb)...just as Facebook was launched
","In tech years, the Bourne Supremacy was ages ago, in fact it was released the same year Facebook was launched believe it or not. Here Jason had no access to Google maps, smartphones (not even a Blackberry lol!!) and so on. Yet he managed to use his brains, braun and IT skills to amazing effect in this blockbuster.I loved the scenes in Russia and India. I wish the DVD had deleted scenes of how Bourne and Marie got used to using the Indian toilet if you know what I mean. Anyway, Goa is a beautiful spot although there are too many Western tourists, so kind of like Bali if you know what I mean. Danny Zorn gets knifed sadly, just as he uncovered Abbott's scheming ways to frame Bourne.",10,0,0,24 July 2017
All the President's Men," More relevant than ever
","With the 2016 presidential election over (pending the Electoral College vote of course), All the President's Men is more relevant than ever. Let the media stand up to the power.The freedom of the press is something that rubs our elected (and non- elected) officials up the wrong way, but we should be thankful for Woodward and Bernstein for their integrity in the face of an electoral landslide from 1972. This movie is gripping even though there's no car chases and Basic Instinct sex scenes. Anyway, if you're into Fast and/or the Furious, then please move on. This movie is not for you I'm afraid.",10,4,5,25 November 2016
