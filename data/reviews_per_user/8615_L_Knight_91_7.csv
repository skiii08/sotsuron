Resident Evil: Afterlife," Plot less and useless...
","Resident Evil: Afterlife was something i looked forward to see because the previous movies were bad so i decided to give this one a chance, o boy, was i wrong! this movie does not have any plot it just zombie killing spree with no story or plot.Acting is just average, nothing special but at least they got the courtesy to put characters form the video game, but still that won't save this movie it's just plot less and doesn't have any connection with the video game franchise(most movies based on a video game are like this but at least they got a plot to back it up).The CGI was amazing specially the 3D effects if you're sitting in the front row i guarantee you will get blown away, the slow motion might been overused but hey it's Resident Evil for you.Overall just wait till it's out on DVD or just rent it, you will waste your money on this movie.",3,4,9,30 September 2010
The Expendables," Great action with a little story
","The Expendables are a gun for hire team that will do your dangerous work that none other can for money. ------------------------------------------------- The story is a bit dull, not much story there it's your average overthrow-a-dictator plot, acting could use some improvement, I felt that all the actors were a bit afraid to act with all their power, the action is superb, not a dull moment in the movie every time you see a gun get ready for loud noise, blood splashing and total and utter annihilation of any building in sight. ------------------------------------------------- This was a good Stallone work, it might not be Rocky or Rambo, but it's still worth it.",8,1,5,12 September 2010
Megamind," Some villains are born to be heroes.
","Megamind, the big-headed alien always picked the last and took for granted while his rival Metroman was the school popular and the handsome boy who everyone wanted to be his friend are always in a conflict and everyone favoring Metroman, Megamind takes this chance to be a villain and extract revenge upon his rival.Seeing the cast was quite the surprise seeing Will Farrell, Brad Pitt and Tina Fey, while i'm a huge fan of Farrell i went to this movie and it was really good, voice acting is top notch, the comedy stands out and i really liked the soundtrack since most of the songs are old-school.This movie is recommended for everyone you will laugh and Will Farrell will draw smiles on the audience, if you get the chance to see it in 3D then go for it since the action scenes are powerful and breathtaking.",10,52,78,13 November 2010
The Town," Thank you Ben Affleck, thank you...
","A friend told me about this movie...well in fact we entered it on a hurry, and let me tell you this: this movie is a must see!It's about a group of professional bank robbers who get the job done perfectly but one of their hits ended up taking a hostage, but seemingly Doug McRay(Affleck) has taken an interest in her, he wants out but his friend's won't take no as an answer.The bank robbery scenes are perfectly done, it's like real action in front of you and the acting is really powerful, the action and the shooting scenes will get that Adrinalin rushing and the plot just keeps evolving and evolving until it reaches the finale.It's a movie that you will feel satisfied after seeing it, actually i never mind seeing it again, highly recommendable.",8,0,2,4 November 2010
Toy Story 3," One Adventure ends...Another begins
","It's been 11 years since the last Toy Story was created, when i knew there was a 3rd installment i immediately told my friends and went to it. and when i finished it regretted it, because i want to wipe my memory clean and watch it again and again! it was that good way better than TS1 and TS2.the story revolves and Andy's toys whose days are over because Andy grew up and goes to collage(Toy Story 3 got the time line right which i liked)and because of a big misunderstanding they end up at a day care,they thought it was heaven to be played with again...but they had another thing coming,meeting Lotsa Hugs they knew where they are and what this place is,eventually they find out that Lotsa has a dark past,that's when they going to bust out with woody's help.Toy Story 3 has it shares of recurring nostalgia,comedy sappy moments(i'm 18 and still sniffed and a certain last scene)this movie targets all genres weather kids,adults,teenager,parents or even grandpas! this movie worth every penny.",10,3,4,29 June 2010
Fast Five," Great action+powerful performance= Fast Five
","I love Fast And Furious movies, all of them had action,story,characters and plots that are interesting to watch, and in my opinion this Fn'F is the best in it's series.The crew is back with Diesel and and Walker with a surprise touch from Dwayne Johnson, O'Connor(Walker) and Toretto(Diesel) find themselves on the other side of the wanted poster and tries to make one last hit as a revenge, not only that they have enough trouble already, now Hobbs(Johnson) a relentless,determined,incorrigible tough nut federal agent who swore that will catch them no matter the cost.The acting is great just what you expect from great names, they blend well together and mesh like a perfect machine. The plot takes it time to build to it's finale and the pace is great. and you will have a couple of moments where your jaws will drop unintentionally from the action scenes in the movie.All in all a great movie that is a must see, you will enjoy it and you friends will enjoy it too, i guarantee that.",10,0,2,8 May 2011
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Twilight Eclipse: in a nutshell
","Gruaduation is fast approaching with Bella's choice still hangs whether to choose between Edward or Jacob, this plot line extends throughout the whole movie with some action in between. seeing this movie made me wonder what's the use of this installment;you can see the hesitation in Bella,you can see the past of certain Cullen family members and i felt hollow after watching this movie. Despite all of it's hype this one stands out in disappointment the acting was a little bit iffy,the plot was slow to improve and the scriptwriting was not done that well. If i were a Twilight fan i might have liked this installment,but this one doesn't cut it i gave it a 4 just because it at least got the plot correct but the other things like acting,scriptwriting,editing...etc was lousy i hope they correct their mistake so we can enjoy the last part.",4,4,6,9 July 2010
