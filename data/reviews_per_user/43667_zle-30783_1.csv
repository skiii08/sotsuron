Blade Runner 2049," Great film
","That helped me catch up on some much needed sleep.Otherwise, what is the point of this film? That the villain is still alive, at large and in control? The old Blade Runner lives and the new one dies? The world is post apocalyptic, but beautiful flakes of snow fall on the ground? The girls are sexy, the hookers are available and one can buy holographic girlfriends in short skirts that make men's mouths water? Is that a grim future?? In other words, this film doesn't make sense. It is not as boring as stupid flicks like the new Star Wars or whatever, but despite the praised effects this film was nonsense and definitely too long. Thank goodness for beautiful women eye candy.",3,18,35,3 November 2017
