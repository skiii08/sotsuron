The Devil's Advocate," Well, well...
","...not such a bad movie. Until the end. I don't want to spoil anything, but the ending of the film is really silly. Therefore, the effect of the whole production is minimized, which is sad because the film has very strong moment which I cannot tell because they, too, would spoil everything.Let us say that there are some subtle story twists that really make the movie worth watching. Period.",6,1,3,23 February 2000
Unbreakable," Good idea, but too slow
","Unbreakable really has a nice story to tell. But M. Nights new movie lacks the intensity of 'The Sixth Sense' and therefore, many scenes just drag along and you have already grown tired of the movie when the final big surprise hits you.Also, the comic book feeling just does not seem to work. As an avid comic book reader, I was quite open to the basic idea of the movie, but by giving the film a very realistic approach, the director lost the opportunity to use the comic genre as he could have. Some of the actions and dialogues of the Willis and Jackson characters therefore simply seem silly instead of fitting into the flow of the story.So all in all though this was an interesting movie, it was way too long and too slow to reach the great quality of its predecessor.",6,0,0,8 January 2001
Fight Club," Civilization sucks? Not in my book...
","Okay, so here it is, the ultimate 'Anarchy rules' movie of the late 90s. I had heard a lot about the film and was very eager to finally see it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in nearly every bit - I thought the movie was sometimes boring, sometimes way to violent and sometimes plain silly.But first for the good parts: Great cinematography and a really surprising point at the end when Edward Norton learn something about himself... it was this final change of pace that kept me from giving this movie a '1 out of 10' rating...But now for the worst parts:Incredibly idiotic monologue sequences. Edward Norton keeps on babbling about whatever you do not want to hear. Meaningless chatter which really starts getting on your nerves after a short while.Gratuitous violence. Excessive portrayals of men beating on other men already lying helpless on the floor. Now, this might have been one important point the film wanted to show, that people tend to be cruel to each other once the barriers in the mind have fallen down - but well, I found out that I just was appalled by this and could see no point in repeatedly seeing bloody people being delivered to a hospital...Unbelievable story developments. Suddenly, practically everybody seems to be a member of the Fight Club. They are not only everywhere, they are getting more and more aggressive in their attempts of destroying society. Things are getting out of hand - I had a hard time swallowing what the director wanted us to believe here...All in all, as I said in the beginning, a very disappointing movie with a splendid basic idea - the point I was talking about that changed the whole perception of what happened before. This point somehow reminded me of the 'Sixth Sense', but it was not administered in such a brilliant fashion, though some scenes of the film made more sense in the aftermath. Still, as a whole I did not like it, the good parts came to late to save it.",3,1,4,25 May 2001
The English Patient," Extremely overrated...
","Not so much to say about this flick than to ask why the hell it got so many Oscars. It is an okay-ish movie with an okay-ish story, but much too long and not that brilliant that it will stay in anyone's memory for very long.I don't like Juliette Binoche, so this might add to my disappointment about the movie. And I can't understand how you can get so hot for Kristin Scott Thomas as well. So sue me... but the movie is just average Hollywood Level.",4,6,13,8 April 1999
The Mummy," Quatermain is back!
","Hey yo, a genre thought dead has returned to the kind of glory it had when Indiana Jones and Quatermain were big - the fantasy adventure genre!Glory of course is a relative term - this movie is all in all just plain silly and has no emotionally deep moment at all - but the film does not fail to entertain in its own very simple approach: Mummy bad, kill mummy!When I was a kid, I liked movies like this. As an adult who still does have fun watching the occasional James Bond movie, I think the Mummy is too much of everything: Too many too simple cliches, too many too one-dimensional characters and too many too foreseeable slapstick gags. Indiana Jones is still in a league of its own, and the Mummy may have been a huge surprise success in theaters, but will be forgotten very quickly.",6,1,1,6 December 2000
The Others," Creepy and surprising...
","I wanted to this this movie because when I saw the trailer, I was impressed about how creepy these small tidbits of the film already were.
The movie did not disappoint me. The atmosphere was really spooky all over and the sound directors and editors did a great job with the surround sound - it really was quite unusual to suddenly hear some noise *above* you! Splendid work in this part!The surprise end really was a great idea, suddenly everything made sense. And I really love it when movies still manage to surprise me, so Kudos to the makers of 'The Others'!",9,1,1,12 January 2002
Ed Wood," Lovable...
","This is a movie with a wonderful story and absolutely lovable characters. I don't know if the real Ed Wood was like Johnny Depp portrayed him, but the character Depp is playing is so wonderfully idealistic, naive and still headstrong that you just have to like him.The bizarre supporting cast, crowned by Martin Landaus brilliant performance as Bela Lugosi, is another element which makes this film so... realistic in a way. I can just imagine walking down the street and meeting those guys, desperately trying to make movie history again.The pure kindness of these characters is it which makes this film work for me. And it nearly made me cry to read the credits and to learn about the end of Ed Wood, the faithfulness of his wife and the fate of the other guys. Excellent work, Tim Burton!",Null,0,0,8 June 1999
The Day After Tomorrow," Have you understood anything at all?
","There is a movie in which the (possible) dramatic consequences of Global Warming are displayed. The message is simple: If we, and that is especially the U.S., keep on destroying our environment, there is the terrible danger that someday, nature will strike back. In Emmerichs movie, this 'strike' is a new Ice Age.End of message, end of movie.But: All people here seem to be caring about is how dull the plot was and how insolent it is to bother Americans with such a topic after 9/11.
I really feel for the victims of this tragedy, but the essence of the movie is lost is these complaints. Because if some kind of weather crisis would actually someday be happening, it would be far worse than a hundred 9/11s together. It is always simple to escape into dream worlds - but the truth remains out there, and it is not about a quarrel between Liberals and Republicans, but about our future. Let's hope Emmerichs vision will never come true. But don't look away from the reality of pollution, wasting our natural resources and Global Warming. That would be an insult to your intelligence...",10,2,3,27 May 2004
X-Men," Splendid comic adaption!
","I really was positively surprised about the much talked about X-Men movie.The characters have been brought on screen in a wonderful way - especially Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Halle Berry as Storm were fantastic in roles as super-heroes. The whole atmosphere is very dark and gritty, which fits the movie very well in its attempt to show a society scared of mutants.
The way in which many small tidbits from the comic books were thrown into the movie was really a joy to see - characters like Kitty Pryde and Iceman or Rogues famous white hair as well as Cyclops remark about yellow latex costumes were just perfect to make this movie a real experience...",9,0,0,8 September 2000
Lost in Translation," Way overrated
","So what's so special about this flick?Two people meet far away from home and do some exploring of japanese culture. The movie drags on and on and on, it's neither boring nor exciting - it just is. One thing the movie certainly is NOT is thought-provoking. I would go as far as saying that I had forgotten it already the moment I left the theater - yes, I thought a lot more about 'X-Men 2' than I did about 'Lost in translation'...Could not make out the splendid direction, could not make out the wonderful screenplay... all I could detect were two excellent actors doing their best while doing nothing special at all.",5,0,1,8 March 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better than expected - worse than it could have been...
","So here it is the new Star Wars movie. I really didn't have any high hopes after the Jar Jar Binks disaster (and insult) which Episode I was. So I could not get disappointed too hard this time, and could enjoy the positive elements of Episode II which were:<ul><li>JarJar Binks playing only a marginal (but still unendurable) role</li></ul><ul><li>No word of Midichlorians (thanks George for no further un-mystifying your lifework)</li></ul><ul><li>Family Fett</li></ul><ul><li>First signs of Anakin becoming evil</li></ul><ul><li>Lots of Jedi Knights in action</li></ul><ul><li>Yoda</li></ul><ul><li>C3PO getting into shape (verbally and physically)</li></ul><ul><li>The music used like in an opera, applying well known Leitmotifs for Anakin (Darth Vader), the Emperor or the Imperial army</li></ul><ul><li>The finale, which was done a little bit like the whole movie should have been done: Bad tidings for the righteous, a great evil unraveling, a dark and frightening atmosphere and the first appearance of the dreaded Imperial war machinery.</li></ul>There were major let-downs as well:<ul><li>The love scenes between Anakin and Amidala (terribly cheesy like out of a Jane Austen movie gone bad)</li></ul><ul><li>The German voice of Hayden Christensen is terrible!!!!</li></ul><ul><li>Too many action scenes, some of them way too long (robot factory for example - this one looked more like out of Monsters Inc. than out of a serious SciFi movie)</li></ul><ul><li>Story development - is there any? - going veeeeery slow, at least half of the movie people are just going from one planet to another following other persons who are themselves following still other persons - this is NOT enough for a decent Science Fiction movie. The evil plot of Darth Sidious stays a little too much in the background. </li></ul>All in all this one is better than Episode I, due to the lack of utter silliness which made Episode I so hard too swallow. There are some very nice touches and some really well done passages, the Jedi Knights are finally shown in there full grandeur - this is good. But the love story really fails to get the viewers interest and makes the movie very slow in the first 60 minutes. All in all: More story, fewer Disney-like action scenes and a love story done right would have made this a really great movie.",5,1,2,20 May 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," Nice movie in the tradition of 'Four Weddings'
","...but not that good.As a Single watching this movie is certainly kind of painful on the one hand, but on the other hand you recognize a lot of yourself in Bridget (even as a man) and therefore you get some delight in knowing that you are not alone with your fate.Especially not when a beautiful girl is sitting next to you in the theater ;-)The movie is light and funny, a nice piece of work but missing the absolute grandeur of 'Four Weddings and a funeral', still better than 'Notting Hill'. Hugh Grant being a bad guy is hard to swallow - even when he behaves like a total a**hole, he still seems to be nice and funny and therefore he just does not fit into his role - but Renee Zellweger really has done a great job. Recommended to watch any time - you can't do anything wrong with this one!",8,0,0,6 September 2001
10 Things I Hate About You," Chemistry is not working
","Though I really love teenage high school comedy, this film just didn't work for me. The characters seemed two-dimensional and often acted totally without any motivation, without any heart. Julia Stiles does not work with Heath Ledger, and the Baywatch boy certainly did not work at all as junior casanova. Some of the actors seemed too young, some too old, and the plot was often so cheesy that it was not only hard to swallow, but also hard to bear.So all in all, we watched three teenage movies that evening and this one was the worst. Unlike American Pie, Mallrats, Road Trip or Ferris Bueller, there is just no good chemistry going in this one. Forget it and get one of the genres jewels mentioned above.",3,1,2,13 April 2001
Notting Hill," Nice, but...
","...nowhere as nice and wonderful as 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' was. Okay, the movie certainly had a hard life from the beginning, always being compared to Hugh Grants splendid Top Ten Ever Romantic Comedy. But even with a lot of good will, Notting Hills just pales in front of its great predecessor.The characters are often blunt, one-dimensional and sometimes boring. Hugh Grant gives his clumsy nice guy routine. Julia Roberts gives her frog smile. And the friends of the Grant character try to achieve the level of sheer beauty and real life feeling that Grants peer group in 'Four Weddings' had, but fail to reach it - they are just some british stereotypes, most of them that is.So this is a nice movie, but far from big. Nice happy ending though. Very unrealistic...",6,1,2,15 January 2001
Bohemian Rhapsody," An emotional 10 for an ode to the greatest singer of all time
","At first I refused to go. As a Queen fan since 1986, born a little too late to ever see them perform live, I was scared that a movie about my life long idol Freddie Mercury was bound to disappoint me. Today, exactly 27 years after him dying way too early, I went to see the movie after many fans talked positively about it where critics didn't. And yes, as you can see I was not disappointed at all.I can see that as a biopic, the movie might be too far away from the facts too often. But what fans tend to understand better than critics is that that's not what this movie was all about. In the end, this movie celebrates, in an entertaining and condensed way, the life of the greatest singer that ever existed. A rock star, an incredible performer, an enfant terrible. His personal tragedy is shown, but while there are some scenes and many allusions converning his lifestyle and sexuality, the main focus is on the music, his grand opus and also, the band. Mercury needed Deacon, Taylor and May, and they needed him.
And that is what fans want to see. There is a whole generation of Queen fans that 'grew up proud in the shadow of the mushroom cloud', and the movie manages to reach us on an emotional level, where we can for a moment forget that those are actors instead of the real band playing at Live Aid. And we can grieve again - one more time - for the musical genius Freddie Mercury, whose light burnt out so long before its time. We grieve for all the songs that we will never hear because Freddie Mercury is dead.
So in my eyes, the eyes of a fan, they managed to pull it off. What a pleasant surprise this movie was!",10,4,5,24 November 2018
American Pie," Surprisingly original!
","I am a fan of teenie movies, I always love to watch them. Mostly, the stories are pretty similar, but somehow this genre has a certain appeal to me. Maybe because I never did something crazy in my teens? Who knows.Anyway, American Pie is really a good movie, a splendid proof that the teenie movie genre is not dead but alive and kicking, and that to portray teenagers in a entertaining way, you don't have to kill them all off (Scream, I know what you did last summer) or let them talk like old men and women (Dawsons Creek) - you simply have to let them act like what they are: Young people looking for the right way to do things, searching for their identity and - off course the focus of this movie - for their sexuality.
While the story is certainly not all new, the way in which it is shown is really hilarious. There are some extremely well placed very crude, but all the more funny jokes, and the characters are simply likeable in their desperate attempts to loose their virginity. Highlights like the 'rendez-vous' with Nadja or the blow-job scene with the not so politically correct disposal of the seminal fluid are simply too funny to resist.All in all an extremely well done teenager comedy which I recommend to every one who has stayed young at heart. Best to watch together with a bunch of friends to start a party! Laughs guaranteed!!!",8,1,2,9 February 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Cinema was invented for this INTENSE kind of experience!!!!
","Breathtaking!Pete Jackson did it! This movie is so extraordinary that it is hard to describe with words alone. It is thrilling, frightening, spine-chilling and exciting from the first moment on.This was the most intense movie experience since I went to see 'Return of the Jedi' in 1983, then being a 11-year old boy. 'The fellowship' simply blew me away, drove me to the edge of my seat more than once. My girl-friend was totally exhausted, saying that she felt like she herself would have walked with the fellowship over the mountains and through the mines - and the last half hour, she only wanted to say 'stop, I cannot walk any further, I'm totally worn out!!!'. For me, knowing the book, the film still was physically strenuous, but I just could not stop adoring the wonderful pictures and the sensational cinematography.Everybody will have his favorite moments in this movie. Mine were the escape from the black riders in the first part and Boromirs fate in the second. No spoilers here, but Sean Bean was fantastic! And I had to calm down my girl-friend during the Troll sequences at Moria - and many more times during the spectacular end...I am very glad that the movie, unlike many others, more than lived up to the hype.Those hours were among the most exciting movie hours I ever had, and I can't wait to see the next two parts. Hard to wait til Christmas 2002!!!",10,1,1,21 December 2001
Armageddon," Crappiest Action Movie I've ever seen
","See, I love Science Fiction, and I don't have problems watching a well made Action Film every now and then.But Armageddon really was a punch in my kidneys. The absolutely unrealistic story and the slimy characters with their more than slimy behaviour really made me want to leave the theatre.The only funny thing were the psychological diagnostics before the mission. The embarrassing portrayal of Russian MIR and the more than embarrassing landing scene ('You are the daughter of the bravest man of the world', baaaaaah) are just two examples which make this movie worth forgetting very quickly...",1,1,3,30 March 1999
American Psycho," Unnecessary brutality
","I'm still a little bit unsure about what exactly this movie wants to express.Does it simply want to shock us with the evil which 'lurks inside the hearts of men' (to quote 'The Shadow')?Does it want to show the inner demons of a mentally departed, totally insane man?Does it want to portray the incredible fact that in a faceless society, murder goes unpunished?To be true, the last suggestion seems a little bit hard to swallow. Neither do I believe that even superficial Yuppies are so unable to tell apart the faces of their colleagues (having myself an extremely well memory of faces, this strikes me as even more impossible), nor do I believe that such a murder spree would not be noticed by anybody. Of course, the story does not want to portray the whole murder spree realistically - it wants to speak to us in metaphorical ways and you know what? It fails.The movie left me confused in the end and disgusted in the middle. I believe that there is enough brutality in this world, it does not need films like this or 'Natural born killers' or any others which portray serial killers.Though the movie was sometimes good, especially in the first 30 minutes showing life and decadence of Bateman, it turned into a piece of gore the longer it took.The actors did great jobs - especially Christian Bale, whose face became a mask of insanity - but still, it failed to deliver a decent message.",4,0,1,30 October 2000
American Beauty," Good, but not that excellent...
","All the enthusiasm about this movie made me very excited to see it.I was a little bit disappointed.Though sometimes interesting and well-done, the movie still seemed to be far from that extraordinary experience which was promised. Many characters were not normal enough to attack the 'American dream' at all - and the story was sometimes stressed and quite unrealistic. Though the actors play well and some new talents have shown their abilities, this movie is just not that special that it earns all the hype.And the dialogues are sometimes boring, sometimes dull. And many character twists are too foreseeable.Still, it is worth watching. But as a European, it just did not strike me as that new and thought-provoking...",8,0,0,29 January 2000
The Patriot," For a true heros epic, rather watch Braveheart!
","The Patriot might be a movie worth watching, but it has a major flaw: Every single 'good' scene has been there before - in Braveheart!!!This movie is far away from Braveheart quality. The characters are one-dimensional, the story is much too simple and the ending is very foreseeable. In many scenes, you know exactly what will happen next, for instance the (very, very, very) bad guy not being dead but only faking it to start a counter attack. This is just one example of way too many movie cliches that are used to make this film very, very, very long and certainly NOT well-dosed as far as strikes of fate that hit the main character go. When in Braveheart, Mel Gibson was taking revenge for the murder of his wife, in the Patriot there are way too many reasons to take revenge for to longer care for the Main Characters pain. Way too many. Not well-dosed. Overexposure to Pathos. That's what stays in mind after watching the Patriot.",4,0,1,21 February 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Beautiful
","I had heard so much praise about 'Crouching Tiger' that I was afraid that I was expecting too much when I finally found a theater which was showing it.But I was not disappointed: The film is a masterpiece in its celebration of everything that's beautiful and it cherishes high ideals like honor, love and honesty. I really liked the story which was starting very slowly and suddenly exploded when the first flying around martial arts sequence came along - what a surprise to see these superhero-like fighters battle in the air, walking up the walls and hovering over the rooftops!From this moment on, the film never fails to get the viewers interest, be it in soft, well orchestrated emotional moments or in fierce, extremely quick fighting sequences.What really got me though was the grand finale: It was heart-wrenching and still so very calm and true, and having a secret love myself I really could feel the emotions of Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien. But while this was already wonderful, the very final scene was even more fantastic - a splendid climax to a splendid movie which made me sit there during the credits totally stunned just thinking: 'What a beautiful ending...'",9,0,0,19 March 2001
Good Will Hunting," Thought provoking
","This movie will always have a special place in my heart.Maybe it is because it was the last movie I saw together with my seven year long girl-friend before we split...Maybe it is because I am on my way of becoming a psychotherapist for children and adolescents just like Robin Williams is in this movie...Or maybe it is just because it is a damn good movie with brilliant actors Williams, Damon and Affleck.I loved nearly every minute of it. The characters were complex and very realistic, and the inner conflict of Matt Damon was so strongly played you could actually see it in the air.I especially loved the scene where Affleck shouts at Damon who wants to carry on being a construction worker instead of using his incredible talent...One of the most splendid movies of the 90s.",10,4,9,30 March 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," I could go on watching forever...
","This second part of the trilogy starts right in the middle of the action and goes on for over three hours without ever lowering the excitement. It ends a little bit sooner than the second book does - probably to offer Christopher Lee a chance to appear in the third part as well - and left me with only one notion: 'What? Is it over already???'I watched the movie at midnight on opening day, and at three o'clock at night I was not one little bit tired. All I wanted was the movie to continue right now - but I guess we'll have to wait another year...Compared to 'The Fellowship', this movie has fewer epic moments (as Boromirs death, the Hobbits being hunted by the Nazgul or the forming of the fellowship) but is somehow told faster without focusing too much on action scenes alone. The shifting between the three different storylines (Rohan (Aragorn), Rohan (Merry/Pippin) and Mordor) makes the movie much more interesting than the book with its very rigid way of telling the story. This way, not a hint of boredom comes up, and the huge cast of characters has a chance to be shown in equal parts. Certainly, the story in Mordor was somehow kept shorter than it could have been, but Jackson had to cut somewhere and he did right by rather highlighting the events happening in Rohan.As for Gollum: I would never have imagined that technology was thus far advanced! The facial impressions of Gollum were tremendous, at first I really was appalled about how ugly he was, but Jackson really captured the essence of Gollum and made him one of the most sophisticatedly portrayed characters of the film. An Oscar for Gollum? It's an opportunity!Many of the other characters were developed further like Aragorn, Sam or Gimli whose comic relief elements were just right: Not too much, but certainly right on the mark! The only thing I cannot really fathom right now is the way the Arwen character goes, how Eowyn fits in the picture compared to the books and why the Rohan storyline ended right after the Helms Deep battle instead of in Isengard. Oh yes: And the attack on Helms Deep was great in the beginning and in the middle, but in the end - after the Rohirrim showed up - it seemed rather hastened, it ended too suddenly for my taste.Not to mention the reality check when Aragorn and Gimli are fighting alone against hundreds of Orcs - but well, they are heroes after all, so who am I to criticize :-) ?",10,1,1,19 December 2002
Ghostbusters," This movie defined 'funny'...
","There is so much to say about Ghostbusters... but I think the most important part is of course the brilliant humor. This film is so full of legendary jokes, I could watch it over and over and over again. The spectacular talent of actors like Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd adds to this in a manner that I think that this movie will still be an evergreen even when we all have grown old and gray...'Are you the gatekeeper?' 'Not that I know of...'For those who have not seen it... WATCH IT!",10,4,6,13 April 1999
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Pathetic excuse for a movie
","I've seen Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown and Pulp Fiction. There was a lot of blood and gore in these movies, but they had a story - something 'Kill Bill' is totally lacking.I was rather appalled to see this movie so many people are mad about - and to see that it's nothing else but a meaningless bunch of fight scenes, full of blood and bad taste.Has Tarantino finally lost his mind? Violence for the sake of violence? No plot whatsoever? Fight scenes ten minutes long that make Matrix 2 look like Citizen Kane? What has happened that our society embraces a movie like this which has nothing to show but blood and chopped of arms and feet?",2,19,35,17 May 2005
Major League," My first contact with Baseball...
","As you might know, Baseball is not big in Germany. Hardly anybody knows or understands the rules. People watch soccer here. Basketball gets bigger. But Baseball? No.So this movie, which many of my friends watched as well, was my first contact with this interesting sport. Of course, it is a fairy tale. Of course, the underdog won't get that big that it will beat everybody and win the championship. Or will it? Sports history tells us different. The story is the same in every sport. Just two years ago, a team just promoted from second division won the German soccer championship! This movie depicts the glorious story of a bunch of outsiders and underachievers who finally win some games. And it is told in such a wonderful manner that you can't but root for them on their way out of the slumps. Yes! It is a simple story! But the characters are wonderful, the wisecracking Harry Doyle incredibly funny and the finals... well... no spoilers here.My most favorite moment is when oldtimer pitcher Harris is replaced by Charlie Sheens character in the finals. In the first games of the season, some die-hard fans had given Sheen the nickname 'Wild thing' and sang the famous song. Now, the whole crowd is chanting this song as Sheen steps onto the field to pitch his largest enemy. This scene always gives me goosebumps. It is splendid.Many great moments, excellent humor and a fate you would wish for your favorite sports team as well - unless you are one of those boring Yankees, Bulls or Bayern Muenchen fans...",9,58,73,23 November 2000
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Kind of nice, but...
","... I really don't understand what all the fuss is about.Well, I have to confess: I have never ever read a book of the Harry Potter series. So this movie was my first contact with the phenomenon Potter.And though the movie was aptly made and mostly painless to watch, it certainly did not give me an idea of how a story so full of stereotypes and borrowed ideas from traditional fantasy stories could ever develop into such a mass hysteria media spectacle. Yes, it might be a nice story for children. That's okay. But what do all the adults find in this story??? The characters are so unendurably good and evil that I could not find the key to the 'magic' behind it.
So well, this is as far as Harry Potter will ever go for me. Certainly did not get interested into reading one of those books. Certainly won't buy ANY of the terrible merchandize available EVERYWHERE. But probably will watch the second movie too, if only to do my girlfriend a favor...",5,0,1,26 November 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," Heaven help me...
","...for Gods sake it's over.I really was never a big Matrix fan from the beginning. The first movie was kind of cool, but the story was by far not that new - to be honest, reality not being reality has been a well known Science Fiction concept for over 50 years.But there had to be a sequel - big money was waiting. So no matter how thin the story was in the first installment of this series - the Wachowski Brothers succeeded in providing even less story and putting together a movie which consists of two main 'devices':<ul><li>Endless (and after a while incredibly boring) Kung Fu fighting scenes</li></ul><ul><li>Tons of utterly meaningless monologues by nearly every character but Neo.</li></ul>
While the action sequences in spite of their seeming endlessness sometimes had an entertaining element in them, the monologues really made me (and many viewers around me as I could hear) yawning. I still can hardly believe what a huge amount of total gibberish the Wachowskis expect us to swallow in Matrix: Reloaded. It seemed that every time they did not know how to explain what was going on, they chose to say: 'It's destiny'.  But when you sit in a movie theatre and have to listen to ridiculous characters from Jacques Chirac to Sigmund Freud talking about nothing but destiny - then that particular story device is certainly overused... and the Rocky Horror Picture Show comes to mind: 'Booooooring!'All in all I was very disappointed and totally unnerved. Do I believe in destiny? Well, I believe in entertainment, and this movie certainly is not entertaining - at all!",2,0,0,2 June 2003
When Harry Met Sally...," Maybe the best love story ever made...
","'When Harry met Sally' is full of truths about life. It shows us why men and women can't live with each other, but it also shows how much they need each other.The wisdoms of Harry (Billy Chrystal) have certainly influenced a whole generation. And Sally's (Meg Ryan) faked orgasm in a restaurant is a magic movie moment.Though I still don't believe Billy's basic message (men and women can't be friends, the sex part always gets in the way), I deeply love this movie for all its unforgettable moments. At least part of this is very real. And that's the reason the film's happy end is so very moving...",10,1,2,8 April 1999
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Powerful
","This film is a good example that some stories can be re-vamped without loosing their touch.In the case of Dracula, a myth I never really cared much for, an old story has been taken and been transformed into a brilliant adventure which does, unlike most other vampire flicks, not only rely on horror effects, but does rather focus on the characters and their relationships. The mild erotic touch of this Dracula version adds to the new flavour of this film, and I have to confess that I was really stunned by the visual power Coppola was able to create. Finally, the actors played great, especially Hopkins as Abraham van Helsing, always on the brink of madness. Excellent!Though die-hard vampire fans probably cried out loud about this one, I think the average audience gets a total package here. The main message ('love never dies') may sound a little bit too 'Hollywood', but the movie has so many strong moments which are both moving and exciting that I always enjoy watching it again.",9,1,2,4 May 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Deeply moving
","I have to confess that I cried at the end of 'Shawshank redemption' - I cried for the first time since my grandmother died. Why was this?The movie is a flamboyant plea for hope in our lives. It shows us that it's never really over, and that you can redeem for you mistakes and find happiness in your days.Of course the final passage might be a bit unrealistic. I just say: Poster. But I really can't blame anybody for doing the story as they did it - it works perfectly and this final passage somehow liberates the viewer after nearly two hours of living in prison. The cinematography is simply splendid, the feeling of being incarcerated is very subtly generated and you only realize it when you finally 'get out' of it. The pictures vary from frightening to simply beautiful, and the dialogue and the comments of Morgan Freeman from the Off are really a joy to listen to.But this is just a very rational analysis of a film that stirs very strong emotions. It is futile to try  to explain this phenomenon in these few lines, and therefore I won't try to do so. I only can highly recommend this movie to everybody who is willing to get into a 2 1/2 hour prison movie which in the end proves to be much more. 10 of 10 even it is a bit long in the middle. 10 of 10 because I somehow felt a bit liberated after it.",10,0,0,25 April 2001
Before Sunrise," Somehow I don't know...
","This movie is really strange. Julie Delpy looks sweet, Vienna is a wonderful city. Ethan Hawke is one of my favorite actors. But the plot is a little bit lame. I somehow have this feeling that all the Hawke character wants to do is to have sex with Julie. Of course he tries to hide this fact, but hey, guys, we know what we're talking about here, huh? I've seen the movie once, I won't watch it a second time.",5,2,9,26 April 1999
Amélie," Too long too long too long too long!!!!!!
","Or at least it SEEMED like hours...Oh my god, here goes my hope for French movies... I usually don't like them. I watch one every two years or so. Afterwards, I always know WHY I don't like them...Everybody was full of praise about this movie. I went to see it with good hopes, but as always I was disappointed: The movie starts out fresh and funny, but after the first half hour or so, it is dragging on and on and on and on and after 90 minutes, I was sure that it was at least a 150 minutes movie. I was terribly bored by Amelies endless chase for this guy and was only happy when the movie was finally over.A movie for women? Maybe, definitely no movie for people who like characters acting straightforward...",3,7,15,15 September 2001
The Truman Show," Splendid idea, great movie
","The Truman Show was certainly one of the best movies that I have  recently seen.The basic idea is very weird, but it is great fun to watch the efforts director and Truman Show staff go through to keep Truman from suspecting he is watched. I especially liked the idea to start with the fictional Truman Show titles instead of the official titles. The illusion is perfect even for the viewer in the theatre.I wonder when this story will come true...",10,0,0,8 April 1999
Thirteen Days," Impressive
","This movie is a  wild ride through 13 crucial days of modern history. Though over two hours long, it does not get boring for a single minute and though you know how everything will turn out in the end, you can't avoid sweating because of all the incredible tension.This is an excellent portrayal of diplomatic finesse and big international politics. The end was near, and it was due to some bright people on both sides that we can still live happily in our world today.
After somehow failing in  the Science Fiction genre, Kevin Costner has returned to glory with this masterful history lesson. All I can say is thank you for this thrilling experience and may your next project be  just as right on target again - history has lots of thrilling episodes, you should find one that suits you just as well!",10,0,0,11 April 2001
The Thin Red Line," I expected more
","This movie I was looking forward to for a long time. When it was finally aired on German Pay TV, I could at last watch it and I was slightly disappointed.Though there are many strong passages in the film which make it a worthwhile experience, there are too many lame or over-ambitioned sequences to compare this one to the big genre masterworks like Platoon.In my eyes, it was the metaphysical dream sequences which spoiled the experience. The director tried too hard to get philosophical, and in some passages the monologues of the characters are plain silly.The war sequences though, supported by splendid actors such as John Cusack, were very intense and there was a lot of suspense and anxiety when the soldiers were simply WAITING for something to happen, knowing that every second they could hear the death bell.Another bad fact was that two of the main actors, James Caviezal and Ben Chaplin, looked so much alike that it was hard to tell them apart in the chaos of war, both wearing the same clothing and a dirty face. Though both did a decent job, it would have been the responsibility of the casting agent to avoid such a problem.All in all a decent war movie, but far from the genres leaders.",6,4,7,30 October 2000
Annihilation," Far worse than the book
","Having finished the book trilogy recently, I was curious how this little known movie was doing in adapting the first book to the screen.Well it was not doing well.The hypnotic quality of especially the first book has not been well translated to the screen. Whereas some major elements of the book are totally left out, the director is adding gratuitous violence, blood and gore. Thank you very much that's exactly NOT how to do it. Also the focus is wrong. Annihilation the book is nearly completely about a team of scientists meandering through a nightmare landscape, but the nightmare is in your head, the book is not using cheap effects to create it. The movie puts to much focus on Lena and her husband - just short flashbacks in the book - on shock effects and on putting aliens in a story where they never actually show in the book.So all in all this is rather disappointing for someone familiar with the books. This could have been a psychodelic experience but the director wasted too much time in focusing on blood, gore and aliens. Maybe they realized that they were not up to something great - that would explain how they rushed the ending to be final instead of speculating on a sequel...",4,1,3,19 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Wonderful, exciting, a masterwork...
","This film is the living example that there can be sequels which are even better than the original.While Star Wars A New Hope was a great movie, the saga was transported to a new level with this second part.The secret of this film's success might be the incredibly dark atmosphere, which is hardly ever interrupted. The movie starts bad for the Rebellion, turns for the worse and ends in an absolute disaster... and the heroes barely make it out alive.Aside from the story, the evil Darth Vader is at his best in this movie. Never again was he allowed to be so mean-spirited. 'Apology accepted, Captain Needa' he snares as his failing officer lies dying on the floor.And we started to get an insight in this magic thing called 'the force'. Jedi Master Yoda has some splendid moments, and the essence of Luke Skywalkers Jedi training will always remain in my heart.Finally: The love scenes between Han and Leia... I am still awestruck when I see them again. I love the sequence on Bespin, the tragic farewell... in my eyes, this is one of the strongest moments of movie history. The music, the cinematography, the editing... and all this crowned by Hans Solos 'I know' when Leia  utters that she loves him. Fantastic.If the second prequel can accomplish to be just half as good as this one, it will be really great! I demand a dark atmosphere film after the light (but enjoyable) 'Phantom Menace'.",10,0,0,28 June 1999
Sin City," Splendid adaption - but disturbing brutality
","You can't blame a movie for being close to the original, can you? Having read most of the Sin City comic books just recently, I sometimes thought that some of the most disturbing portrayals of extreme violence and bloodshed should have been left out in the movie. It is something different if you have a black and white panel in a comic book or if you have moving pictures which make the experience much more alive.Still, apart from the blood and gore criticism, the film is a very exact rendition of what the comics are about. Harldy ever has any form of book been transferred to the big screen in such an unbiased form - certainly due to Frank Miller being the co-director of the movie.The movie is fast-paced, the characters are strong and the visual adaption of the comic is breath taking. If you close your eyes during some of the most violent scenes, you have a perfect example of a comic book movie here.Still, I thought that some of the elements left out in the Hardigan storyline were diminishing the personal drama the character is going through. Maybe it would have been better to show these elements - scenes in which Hardigan talks to his wife or is confronted with Senator Roark in court - and to leave out one or two severed limbs instead?",8,0,1,19 August 2005
Braveheart," An epic about heroism and the value of freedom
","When I first saw Braveheart, I was awestruck by its sheer visual power. Never has the desire for freedom been portrayed in such a splendid manner.When I traveled to Scotland a year later, I could feel this desire still burning in the proud souls of the scottish people. And even though the movie is historically flawed, it still captures the spirit of what the life of William Wallace was all about.Some of the scenes I could watch over and over again. It still makes me shiver to see how a man sacrifices himself for the freedom of his people. This is true heroism...",10,1,2,30 March 1999
The Wedding Singer," Great homage to the 80s
","Oh my, what a surprisingly good movie.I watched this one with friends, and we were laughing so hard that the neighbors must have thought we had gone mad.This is one of the first movies to play, but not being produced in the 80s. To see the clothes and the haircuts, to hear the music again is really an interesting experience. But the wonderful story with the romantic happy ending is what really makes this film so special. I loved it. But I am a child of the 80s...",10,1,1,8 April 1999
Back to the Future," Perfect!
","There are few movies where I can't find any negative element in. This is one of them.The basic idea of time-travel is of course not new, but never has it been shown in such a wonderful manner. The puns ('Get used to the bars, Joey'), the storyline and the extremely thrilling finale make this movie very special.And of course we have brilliant actors who play absolutely lovable characters. I am certain that I was not the only boy in puberty who would have given everything to be as cool as Marty McFly...Though the sequels have not been bad as well, this movie is the ultimate Science Fiction comedy of the 80s. It's a pity films like this or 'Ghostbusters' are no longer made.",10,2,4,13 April 1999
