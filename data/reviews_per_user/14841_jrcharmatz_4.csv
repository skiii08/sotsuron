Skyfall," A Let Down
","First off, I would like to explain myself before people get angry. This was not the best Bond and this was not the worst bond. The movie had some good scenes, do not get me wrong. The thing that really made me dislike it was how it wasn't like the 'old-style' Bond. He really didn't do anything that made me jump out of my seat.Let's go to the opening scene where Bond was in the building trying to save his operative. No one wants that. If anything he could have made a better exit.Now here are some things I liked. The villain was probably the best one out of all the bond movies. Furthermore, the abandoned city was also interesting. It is crazy how Bond gets out of that with not much trying involved. He makes it look easy, that is what I like about him.To end on a good note, Quantum of Solace was definitely the worst and will always be the worst. Bottom line: Go see it because it is not a waste of money.",7,1,4,9 January 2013
Django Unchained," Quentin Tarantino's Best Movie
","Even though in the movie there were some 'hard-to-watch' scenes, it is definitely a movie you should see. The plot was perfectly constructed and I am glad they stuck with Jamiee Foxx for the main actor.I am going to give this movie an 8 due to the fact of the director making it as real as possible. Sure, the word that no one likes to hear in a movie was used, but, nonetheless, it added to the effect.I also likes the idea of the Westerny time period. Also, the movie was about 3 hours long, but that didn't stop me or anyone else in the theater to stop watching. Some parts were funny like when there was the Ku Klux Klan raid and they couldn't see out of their masks.I would love to see this movie again and I hope the next movies that Tarantino makes are as good as this one!",8,1,4,8 January 2013
Taken 2," Bottom Line: Don't go see it.
","I actually feel like I wasted and hour and a half of my life. Taken 2 has let me down.The first reason is the screenplay. The cameras switched off people too quickly. Yes, I understand they tried to make it a fast-paced movie, but you really could not keep up.The second reason is the plot. Why is it that there weren't any 'I can't believe that happened' type scenes where it just blew you away? They all sort of got taken throughout the movie, but it was only for a short period of time.The only applause I give to this terrible movie was somewhat of the creativity. When they showed Liam Neeson tracing his steps and listening to the sounds around him and calculating the turns, that was pretty cool. Also where he told his daughter how to coordinate that back to him.Bottom line: I wish they could have done better and this is nothing compared to what Taken 1 was. Don't buy it on DVD because honestly it is a money waster.",3,0,1,8 January 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," A Great Batman
","Let's make one thing clear: The Dark Knight was officially the best batman. This comes to a close second.Sure, Bane had a 'talk-in-a-cup' voice, but I thought it sounded cool. The airplane scene was especially good because you would not think he would have made it out of there. Furthermore, it is crazy on how the true villain was inside the police. Bane was just the missionary.So, to sum things up, buy the movie and watch it. The whole batman series still has not let me down and the mysteries keep on going.I hope you all enjoy this movie as much as I did.Go see it.",8,3,7,8 January 2013
