The Sound of Music," A classic
","I'm just writing this review to finish my profile. But this is a classic movie. Get rid of that annoying scene with the puppets and you've got yourself a solid 8. I need five lines of text so allow me to continue. One of my favorite quotes is by a man named W.E.B. Du Bois. He wrote of double consciousness: 'It is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. One ever feels his two-ness, an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.' I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did!",7,0,2,19 August 2017
