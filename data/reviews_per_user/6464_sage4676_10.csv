First Man," Not a smash boom bang film, but well told story
","So many people have lambasted this film because they expected lots of rockets, planes, explosions etc. That is not what this film is totally about. A few great moments are highlighted during the film but basically it tells more of what it took socially, psychologically and intellectually to get through the training and eventually succeed in the mission. Yes, so much emphasis on the family life can be a bit long and slow, but understanding more of what it was like to do it makes it worth seeing. It would help if one has the knowledge of what it took to be a test pilot in an X-15 getting dropped from the wing of a B-52. That, and some basic knowledge of the timeframe of NASA and the strive for the moon.",7,3,7,21 October 2018
Salt," somewhat 'an action film' but fantasy
","This has plenty of action if you want to see fighting, shooting, crashes filled with many basically impossible stunts a human would never survive. The character 'Salt' might as well be a creation from Marvel when she can pretty much do anything she wants and still be human. If you look at it as just an action flick, then fine. If you want it to be a mare realistic action flick then no, this gets pretty silly fast",4,0,3,20 April 2019
Now You See Me," A very good, well shot movie
","The movie has lots of twists and turns like any magic show so you can keep on guessing right up until the end. All of the acting is done very well and you can see how many illusions can possibly be done. It definitely keeps you wondering all along they way so I wont' give any hints right here. Things happen in Vegas, Paris, NYC and more. All kinds of fun places to visit. Pay close attention as it goes along and keep trying to guess the ending, you will be surprised.Not a great movie but very entertaining to see. I doubt there will be any sequels or prequels like so many others. I am trying to get to ten lines, so I will keep on rambling.",7,0,2,3 June 2013
Captain America: Civil War," Marvel films are usually pretty good. This gets only a 6 from me.
","I always loved Marvel films with all of the comic book characters coming to life. The action and special effects are always great and they are here too. Tough to beat what they had in Deadpool though. This is is little too long and had silly cross stories to fulfill the Civil War prerequisite. They want to fight each other and it gets a little silly through most of the film. If you are into explosions and such, this is fine. But to work your mind and follow what is happening, not so much. I guess I need to write more so I will to get his review in. I really don't have that much to day about the film since none of really sticks to my brain. Great films do that. This one didn't The great part of all these Marvel films is the cameo role of Stan Lee in every film. This one is very late in the film. Also, there is great info about a new Spiderman movie coming in the future with Marissa Tomei as his aunt. She has more lines in the but after al the credits roll than in the film.",6,2,9,12 May 2016
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," I didn't see in 'till Blu-Ray but a GREAT FILM!
","I was not available to see films in 2011 to 2012 but when I got it on BRD, this is one of the better films I have seen in a very long time. The best part was a repeat of the line that originated with Charlton Heston with, 'Take your stinking paws off me you damn dirty ape!' The ape gave use the word human substituted or ape. The storyline is great, the effects are top notch. I like to buy and get the digital version right with it. Just make sure your digital version hasn't expired. I made that error in the past so if you insist on both copies, make sure you are purchasing and receive what it advertised. I don't work for anyone that sells discs but get what you pay for. I always do.Buy it, watch it, and you will enjoy it.",8,2,3,11 July 2014
Gone Girl," I very long film that doesn't do much for men except say what idiots we can be.
","It is way too long and has gotten so many great reviews. My main question is 'why great reviews?' I don't know why since it is to long and slow paced to pay close attention to it. The best part is as Rosamund Pike does her character she is a total psycho. The ending is not with waiting for. I was hoping for great trailers but there is nothing there. My understanding is the person that wrote the book stuck straight to here story in the screenplay and that reminds me why I read so few books. This is not 'Oscar worthy' in any fashion. The only award it should get is a raspberry award for a really crappy film. Other than that, I would see Maze Runner, Dracula Untold, The Judge, or anything else other than this. Not worth any money to sit for three hours to get through this.",3,23,53,12 October 2014
I Am Legend," The Alternate Story Version is way better
","The alternate version is way better and absolutely has a much better ending. That includes several, short additional scenes that all add up to a much better and ,much more realistic ending. If you have become a fan of the film from the original version the alternate will have you happy line and sinker.Traveling way back to to Charlton Heston version of the story entitled, 'The Omega Man' it still follows pretty much the same story but with better timing techniques I am legend is so much better.Don't just buy the streaming version if you love this film. Get the Blu-ray Disc. Maybe it will come out in 4k eventually or even better, a completely new remake. Viruses always lead to great stories and great movies.",9,0,0,15 April 2019
Burlesque," Great music decent story
",Christina Aguilera and Cher signing tunes in the same film has to be tough to top. The tunes are all pretty great and the storyline is pretty good too. Anyone a fan of Christina's and musicals will love this.,7,1,1,17 November 2018
The Big Short," The truth hurts and isn't actually funny
","Why this is considered a 'comedy' has me wondering. Was 'Too Big to Fail' considered a comedy because it was about the same timeline and events. There were many funny moments to me but neither of these are comedies. A comedy is where I go and expect to laugh out loud, roar and tell stories about the jokes. Not chuckle a few times and remember the events and dread of the years in that business. 'The Big Short' wasn't meant to be a comedy but more like a serious look a foolishness and greed that gets into everyone. There are many funny moments but not meant to be considered a comedy movie like 'Trainwreck' or 'Sisters'. Comparing those movies in the same category is like saying 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is a musical competing with 'Pitch Perfect 2'. Both are fun but alike at all. Why some get put into certain categories is silly.At any rate. ' The Big Short' is a great film. I know it because I was a serious money manager way back when all this happened.",8,1,1,8 January 2016
Deadpool," A very fun movie that has lots of bad language and funny scenes and jokes
","This is not one to bring a youngster along with or for anyone that is offended by offensive language. It is funny and quite adventurous and like all Marvel films, Stan Lee has a short cameo. It It is worth watching the credits cuz there are many cartoon like items while they run, and like so many films these days, there is a short scene after all the credits end. They just want to keep you there but it is very cute. Ryan Reynolds and Morena Baccarat are great in it, (they all are), But I especially liked her. I watched her in so much in Homeland that it's tough to lose when she is in the film. I also really like the quick reference to one of the short little mutants as Ripley in 'Alien 3'. When you see it you will know what I mean. Work the time and money to see and enjoy and laugh at.",9,6,18,14 February 2016
