The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," For the first time in the series I felt I'd seen a real movie.
","For the first time in the series I felt I'd seen an amazing twilight movie. Eclipse is not the best one , Breaking Dawn pt 1 is the best one yet everything is amazing in this movie ! very impressive and very realistic , i fell asleep during twilight , New Moon and eclipse unlike Breaking Dawn. BD was really masterful , i can say this one deserves at least one Oscar its has everything suspense , romance , battles , action .. the wedding was emotional . the birth was phenomenal and realistic ,you can relate to the characters and you can understand how they feel ,BD has a real romance ,The villains have reasons to kill ,the actors and actresses are attached to their character and love them and you can see that clearly in Breaking Dawn , my whole thinking about the twilight saga changed after watching breaking dawn actually i almost cried at the end but there's so much sex and kisses and so much blood so i don't recommend it for the teenagers.",10,55,116,1 November 2011
