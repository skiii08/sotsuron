Marie Antoinette," Strongly visual and dramatic piece of cake (historical spoilers, folks)
","Kirsten Dunst is a lovable Marie Antoinette. Her face expression when they take away her dog will set the tone for her ways throughout this film by Sofia Coppola. This is a girls' candy world, and as those sort of worlds are, it is not without sadness and despair. I totally agree with Roger Ebert on this one (I do most of the times): the fact that we know her true fate is only the fatal frame to this bloodless visual feast. Marie is surrounded by strict manners and rituals, is forced to give birth in front of a superficial crowd, is taken away from her family at 14, is given the power of monarchy. Â¡She was a teenager, for God's sake! Though there's no tragedy in Coppola's film, you can feel the eerie atmosphere of the pompuous against a doomed political time. Modern music sounds so fresh in this kind of movie. It reminded me of Jesus Christ Superstar, where the anachronic was just a way of tying our world with the past. It serves as a link between what we think we know of that time, and the way we feel emotions today. Marie Antoinette is so beautifully crafted, you almost taste every cherry and dessert. You are living inside this impressive palace, and witness her fragility through Dunst's persona. It is a film about emotions, not facts. And it works so much. It's one of those films you experience, not watch.",7,1,3,9 February 2007
Hostel," Scream+bad makeup+nudity+lame ending=Hostel
","After I read all the comments in this site about how graphic and brutal Hostel was, I was expecting at least something in the vein of Audition a movie with far better make up and way more perverse than this one, but instead all I've got is something like a Scooby Doo film with some gore and to be honest, lame gore. Cabin Fever was neat because at first you thought it was a slasher flick and it turned out to be something different. It was a fun trip. But Hostel seems like a video game. An absurd montage of gory scenes with no purpose at all, and it's not even disturbing or exciting. It's just stupid. There was some nice humor, like the Pulp Fiction part. I was laughing at that. Oh, and by the way I really don't understand why you people complain about all the nudity. That's a human body with no clothes on and that's it. Why do you find it so offensive? Maybe because there was almost no male nudity, but it's not something to be offended about. But it gets dull. Yeah, that I will give you. The eye part was the worst. I couldn't stop thinking about how fake it looked. Roth did a great job in Cabin Fever with special make up. But this is terrible. You can't get fooled by it.The ending was far convenient for Paxton. I mean, I was waiting for a scene where the T -1000 would show up to help him through. It's not realistic, nor even suspenseful. You just know it's almost the end and can't wait for the titles to show up.If you think this is real 'horror' and 'gore', you haven't seen a lot of flicks.",5,1,2,23 January 2006
Spider-Man 2," Thwipp 4 ever!!!
","Spidey rocks!!! I don't see how you can call this movie boring, I've seen it 3 times already, and find it totally amazing, full of heart and fun. I never get the sensation that a certain scene must pass right away, but enjoy every single one of them. Spidey 2 is what every summer flick should be.Yeah, the dialogue is not Ghost World, and it was never intended to be that way!!! Gee, have you ever read a Spider-Man comic? The dialogue is not that deep, but it's the facts and the movement of the whole concept that counts, and this movie has every single aspect of the comic book Â–with it's minor changes to make it into cinema. Sam Raimi got a great kick a** movie, and we do care about everyone on Spidey 2. I really can't wait to see how the try to top this. If the don't succeed, at least there's Spider-Man 2. Best comic book movie ever.Boring??? Yeah, right.",10,0,0,5 July 2004
Cloverfield," This is not the way it was meant to be
","Cloverfield goes for the found-civilian-documentary approach, and then violates it's own rules by adding lame acting and stupid out-of-a-video game situations. The Blair Witch Project stuck with it's documentary style all the way up to the end. That's not the case with Cloverfield, and all those stupid decisions (keep the camera taping while on desperate situations, for example) just destroy the concept of 'reality' it's trying to imply. We end up with a boring story and some glimpses of what could really be a devastating attack on New York City. Lets face it: this thing wants you to feel it did happen. The problem is that it sticks so many regular narrative vehicles it doesn't feel real. Then the pace and ideas start to repeat over and over, until everything feels exahusted. There's one point where you stop getting amazed and just begin to wonder when the hell it's going to end. It's no better than Emmerich's Godzilla.",4,9,22,1 February 2008
Hotel Rwanda," Emotionally gripping
","What is it that makes a story worth telling? Yeah, what happened in Rwanda was one of the most horrible (and unnoticed) things in recent history, but how would you tell that story without focusing just on the horror? Hotel Rwanda delivers the task so mercilessly it will leave you breathless. This is a story about priorities, about survival in the most horrific circumstances, about pride and intelligence. Paul (Don Cheadle) is an amazing character. He makes you feel ashamed of yourself. Could you face this sort of thing in the same fashion as he did? I kept asking myself that question the whole time. To be reminded of this atrocities is one thing, but to confront them and still keep a straight and gentle face is another thing. Paul is such an amazing character he's beyond human, and Don Cheadle portrayed this man with such dignity and charisma it left me biting my nails every moment. I also loved Joaquin Phoenix's character. You always wonder what the feelings of journalists would be given the chance to cover a story like this, and I think he hits the mark very close. This is not an entertainment movie, it's a wake-up call for mankind.",9,1,1,15 August 2005
The Hills Have Eyes," Aja tones down for American remake
","Yeah, this film's first 45 minutes are a bore. I think Aja tried to introduce the audience to the characters and the mood of the film the same way some flicks from the seventies (TCM, Dawn of the Dead, the original Hills Have Eyes, I Spit on your Grave) did, but in this case it really drags and feels like an empty attempt. If you loved Aja's Haute Tension, I think you will be expecting the same realistic impact from the violence, but don't be fooled, THHE doesn't feature anything like that. It's gorier, but the tone of the violence is your typical American tone, instead of the European wild-and-insane- as-hell violence present in Haute Tension. So this movie seems more like that a movie. One of the things that really made an impact on the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, was the way it was filmed. Like a documentary. Haute Tension had a small dose of that, and it worked, but this one is filmed in such a neat way it feels artificial. Don't get me wrong. There's plenty of violence, but I wasn't really moved by it. The miners look good, but not particularly disturbing. If you have seen Chris Cunningham's 'Rubber Johnny', you'll find nothing disturbing about THHE's mutants there's one that resembles Rubber Johnny too much. The death's aren't that violent either. They are pretty repetitive. After everything I read here, I was expecting something with more impact.You will have fun. But that's as far as it goes.",7,0,0,13 April 2006
Ratatouille," Ratatouille must get a Best Picture nomination (in a fair world)
","Brad Bird really moved me when I saw The Iron Giant, a film I didn't want to see at the time. That little animated feature is simply beautiful and touching. Ratatouille takes that level of emotion to another point. Way higher. Don't think kids won't get it. They're not stupid. I remember going to the movies with my parents (they took me to Abel Gance's Napoleon) and being fascinated by the whole thing, even if I didn't understand the whole idea. This is not a comedy. There are some laughs and everything, but it's something more intelligent and dramatic. It's an astounding and complex film about longing for a different life and trying your own talents. About not to be content with the way things are and to go and challenge everything. Even if you end up empty-handed. Gorgeous animation, great script, wonderful characters. This is how things must be done.",10,5,7,23 July 2007
Saw II," What the hell are critics and audiences talking about???
","Gee This movie is a total letdown. I got bored in some parts, and the 'horror' bits of Saw II are totally forgettable. The twist at the end of the first flick was awesome, despite the awful acting, it was worth the ride. But this What is this? Some things I really didn't like about it:¿No MTV editing? Are you blind? This looks like a Francis Lawrence video from start to finish.Gory/disgusting/unbearable? Damn!!! You guys are really numb from watching Scream and thinking that was hardcore horror. I was waiting for the 'gory' and 'disgusting' parts to start and then the movie ended. What a letdown. Smart killing devices my arse. The only good trap was the needle trap, and it wasn't that great either. Just amusing and that's it.And that 'twist' at the end. OMG, it was the worst thing ever. What is this? Star Wars? Everything said by Jigsaw was pure trash. Compare that to John Doe's words from Seven when he confronts Mills. Now that was intense and I suffered through it.Saw was a good excuse to eat some popcorn and hug my girlfriend, and that was it. If you're into your typical American-horror-film, this is it. I found Haute Tension more gory and satisfying, despite the stupid twist at the end.Cheers!!!",5,3,6,17 January 2006
The Descent," Neil Marshall kicks major butt
","I had already seen Dog Soldiers, and though it has its mistakes and lowdowns, it still manages to be a pretty decent horror/action flick. Way better than a lot of stuff out of the American and Japanese market. With The Descent, Neil Marshall is on my Top 5 Horror Movie Directors list. This one is claustrophobic, has strong female characters, the scary parts are truly scary, and you actually feel so into the film you can't escape its grip. People are always looking for a frightening horror film, and this one delivers on that department. It's almost like you're inside the caverns with all those girls. You've got the resulting tension from being trapped inside the cave. You've got the drama from Sarah's tragedy. You've got that awesome use of light where you can clearly see what's going on but still feel you're surrounded by complete darkness. And you've got the intense mutant sequences, with lots of blood and clever camera movement. The way Marshall portrays the mutants is incredible. The first time you get a glimpse of one them reminded me of the moment when you first see the aliens in Signs at the children party. Truly frightening. Another added value is that the copies showing in Mexico City are the UK copies, with the complete ending, and not the happy thing they're showing in the States. That was a clever move from the distribution company.This movie is not as gory as everyone has made it out to be. It's gory, but not unbearable or anything. At least is way gorier than Hostel.See this one at the theater. The use of light is impressive, and it adds so much to the whole experience.",8,4,9,13 February 2006
Sin City," 2005 will be remembered as the year of Sin City
","What can I say? Beautiful film. Those who can't see art in the form of comic book language are truly blind idiots. I wasn't a fan of Frank Miller's Sin City novels, I was just a casual reader back in my comic- book buying days, but I clearly remember a lot of panels and moments that I read, and still have them fresh in my mind. Having witnessed Robert Rodriguez's Sin City I am just speechless. It's a beautiful film encapsulated in a very violent for a mainstream film package. This is the way this material was to be done. All of the characters are like a trash can where you can reach into and find something beautiful inside. I have these clear images of Marv's story from the comics in my head, and the way it's done here Gee, it's astonishing. Everything's been said about this movie, and I'm thankful Rodriguez could capture all of it's violence and humanity in just two hours. Great indeed.",8,1,3,25 July 2005
