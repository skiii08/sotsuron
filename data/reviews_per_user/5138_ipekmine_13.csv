3:10 to Yuma," 3:10 to Yuma from a Russell Crowe fan's perspective
","3:10 Yuma is one of my favorite movies, and that's pretty cool considering that I'm not a big fan of Westerns. However, with this movie, it seems impossible to be disappointed –from the cast to the director, from the plot to costumes and music, it's altogether a fruit of quality work. Apart from the motion picture itself, I'd been pretty surprised and further impressed with the behind the scenes features and interviews, as the making of the movie turns out to be just as impressive as what we see on big screen. Especially the 'town' that was built and the train brought to the area were really cool, and it's amazing how the crew managed to give us a dusty, dry Arizona scenery out of what was actually covered in snow. In terms of acting, I think the whole cast was simply good, each and every character was portrayed properly, fitting their role and the overall story -as expected from a team led by the Christian Bale-Russell Crowe duo. The two, in my opinion, had excellent chemistry, in a way that it makes you like both characters equally and understand where they come from, what they do and why. Then again, if I were to choose, I'd go for Ben Wade in a heart-beat, owing to the magnificent portrayal by the talented Russell Crowe. For starters, Crowe once again gives us a brilliant accent, adds a dose of 'Russell' to his role, and adds Ben Wade to the long list of 'unforgettable characters Russell Crowe played'. Ben is not just some outlaw with a fast trigger, nor your usual villain. He's smart, extremely charismatic, and a damn good leader –wait for it– with conscience! He's not purely bad (as Pearly Soames was in Winter's Tale), but is the kind of bad guy that the young look up to (as Dan's son, William does), ladies admire and ordinary men envy. In other words, he's probably 'made bad', as hinted by the scene where he tells Dan the story of his mum leaving him at the station with a Bible (speaking of mum, just gotta love the scene 'even bad men love their mamas'). All in all, whatever life's done to him, it seems to have made Ben Wade a brilliant leader who earned absolute loyalty of his gang (his words as they drink for Tommy at the bar shows what a determined and focused leader he is, one of the many cool quotes of the movie: 'Tommy was weak. Tommy was stupid. Tommy is dead.') Furthermore, I simply loved Ben's wittiness and was a pleasure to see a good many excellent Russell Crowe smirks on screen (e.g. the scene where Wade is detained and told that he's going to end up hanged; the part in the hotel room when he asks Dan 'You mean we're still not friends?' and the whole dinner scene at Dan's place). The only two scenes I am not a big fan of are –as expected– where Byron gives Ben a rough time after we say goodbye to Tucker (Kevin Durand's part is small but brilliant nonetheless, by the way!) and the scene when the Dan and the rest catch up with Ben in the tunnel, in the hands of some old enemies, if I may say so (ouch! do not hurt Ben Wade or you'll regret it, peeps!). And only one thing in the entire movie I don't really understand, why and how, seriously, does the girl (Emma) not runaway with someone so absolutely hot and amazing and breath-taking as Rus.. I mean, Ben Wade?! :) Taken altogether, Russell Crowe fan or not, I see no reason why one wouldn't like this movie. Do give it a shot if you haven't already – you're not gonna regret. **walks away singing 'they'll hang me in the morning, and I'll never see the sun '**",8,0,0,7 June 2014
Source Code," Gives you all you'd expect from this sort of science fiction
","Before people brutally criticize this The Source Code, they'd better consider that it's a sci-fi movie, not a quantum physics lecture. It may have flaws, the 'theory' behind the plot might not be 100% solid, but so what? Still a damn good movie! Its got the flavor of previous successful movies such as 12 Monkeys, Inception, Deja Vu, Surrogates, The Butterfly Effect, Matrix etc. but it's not a boring repeat at all. This movie gives you good acting combined with a good screenplay, there are a few clichés but there are some cool twists as well. Long story mad short, The Source Code is pretty much all you ask for in this kinda movie. All in all, I really, really liked it.",7,0,1,14 June 2012
Se7en," One of the most successful movies of its kind
","David Fincher, Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey: You can't go wrong with this team, can you? This is why Se7en is 9 out of 10 for me. Almost perfect among the films categorized in the group of thriller/crime movies. With a very solid plot which does not allow the film to turn into a cliché about cops chasing a serial killer, Se7en stands out as a successful thriller. It's a good crime/mystery story delivered by exceptionally good acting, very good directing and a flawless screenplay. While Morgan Freeman steals the show, Brad Pitt proves that he's a promising actor, and not just one of the most handsome men in Hollywood. Needless to say, Kevin Spacey's performance as John Doe leads to one of the unforgettable villains on big screen. All in all, it's a must-see and definitely one of the best of its kind.",9,2,3,15 June 2012
500 Days of Summer," Super boring
","I decided to watch this movie having heard good comments from others, accompanied by awards and nominations as well as good reviews from critics. Last, but not least, an IMDb rating of 7.9 was more than impressive to give it a shot. And, what did I find in 500 Days of Summer? Nothing. Absolutely nothing! I honestly can't believe people rated this movie as 6, 7 or 8! The plot is super slow and boring, full of meaningless, unnecessarily repeated flashbacks without a solid story in the background. A guy likes the girl, she doesn't want any commitment,and bam! she marries someone else just like that. So? what's the point? what's the whole purpose behind this movie, apart from wasting 95 minutes of life? This is not even a cliché, it's an epic fail and I can't help but wonder why it's categorized as comedy in addition to drama and romance. What's the comedy aspect in this over-estimated, empty movie?!",4,1,3,15 June 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," At World's End did not disappoint me
","Having seen the first two Pirates of the Caribbean movies, and having liked them both a lot, I'd been looking forward to seeing At World's End. Now that I did, I can say that it did not disappoint me at all so guess it'd be fair to say that the POTC team did great a job again. I for one am not that impressed with the way the trilogy's been wrapped up, though. Coulda been a more unexpected, somehow different ending to this big series, but well, maybe my expectations have gone too far. But it ain't me to blame for that 'cause the first two movies were so great that I could only hope for more, you know? All in all, the third movie is really, really good (8 out of 10 for me) but part of me says the first of the trilogy was the best of all.",7,3,5,2 June 2007
Zodiac," Definitely recommendable for those interested in the genre
","Zodiac is a typical David Fincher movie, a good crime drama based on real events with enough tension to include the film in the thriller category as well. The cast is well chosen and everyone's performance is equally great, leading to an overall good quality in terms of acting. One may argue that the film's a bit longer than it should have been, which I agree, but it still isn't boring, because the questions add up and tension grows, so you don't really notice how much time's passed. At different time points you may end up suspecting different characters to be involved in the Zodiac killings, and this certainly makes it a better movie, and makes you want to watch till the end and find out what actually is happening and who's done what. The ending is my least favorite part, not satisfactory enough, but it seems there's not much to do about it as the ending is also based on real events. Obviously, real life isn't as interesting as movie world. All in all, for those who like these kind of movies, Zodiac is highly recommendable. For instance, those who liked Fincher's Se7en would most probably enjoy this film as well.",6,1,2,18 June 2012
Les Misérables," Certainly meets the expectations!
","Apart from a few epic exceptions, I'm not into musicals, which may be the reason it took me so long to check out Les Miserables, but I finally watched it, and honestly found more than what I expected. The promising cast surely meets the high expectations from such a story and production, resulting in a very, very good musical in my opinion. Anne Hathaway was brilliant, hats off to her, yes, but no one's performance was disappointing anyway! Almost every scene was bursting with feeling (various feelings, that is), successfully reflected thanks to the director as well as the cast. Every actor obviously put a lot of effort and made their talents talk, and so it's been a pleasure to watch this version of Les Miserables. The second half was exceptionally emotional and there were quite a few scenes that blew me away. One of them certainly Gavroche, Javert and the medal (*gulps*). The flow was, however, rather slow t certain parts of the movie, but can't thinks of any other major problems with Les Miserables. All in all, I'm glad I checked it out. A goodie of the genre for sure. A 7/10 for me, only because I can't do 7.5 on IMDb.",8,1,1,24 August 2013
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Harry's Wondrous World
","I'm a big fan of Harry Potter; the books AND the movies. I can easily say that the first movie of the series is my favourite among all 8 HP movies, and it's also one of the most successful adaptations among films based on books. It must have been a huge challenge to reflect J.K. Rowling's amazing world to the big screen, and equally challenging to do so with three main characters who happen to be only kids at the very start of their acting career. However, everything's done so professionally that the magic in the book is transferred into a movie which is interesting for almost any age group in my opinion. The glory of the unique adventure of Harry Potter is nicely put in the screenplay and every little detail from costumes to locations are blended into a movie which is only the beginning of a legendary saga.",10,1,3,15 June 2012
The Holiday," One of the sweetest, nicest ChickFlicks
","I didn't have high expectations about The Holiday, I'd assumed it was a typical chickflick with a good cast; however, it turned out way better than just that. The plot is as full & satisfactory as it can be for this kind of movie, the characters are nicely reflected, and the film brings you a smile, brightening your mood in one way or another. One of the main problems with this genre is trying to add funny bits and ending up in a ridiculous scenario, but thankfully, this does not happen in The Holiday - there's no exaggeration regarding the comedy aspect. There's also a bonus in this film, the character, 'Arthur Abbott', played by Eli Wallach, who pretty much steals the show. I loved his parts and Kate Winslet surely did not disappoint, either. All in all, I can recommend The Holiday for those into sweet, heart-warming movies.",7,0,2,30 June 2012
The Water Diviner," A beautiful, heart-wrenching journey to all those that love the art of cinema.
","One does not have to be Turkish or an ANZAC descendant to be interested and touched by this film.. doesn't need to be necessarily interested in history, either. The Water Diviner offers something for everyone who carries a heart and soul. It offers a beautiful yet heart-wrenching journey to all those that love the art of cinema.If I were asked 'what is this movie about?' I'd say it's an epic tale of love and hope, a beautifully crafted story inspired by real life, and a breath-taking masterpiece that makes you forget where you are, or what time/day/year it is. It really is a captivating film. The story itself may sound rather simple to some, but in my opinion it's a spectacular mix of reality and art. Hats off to Andrew Anastasios and Andrew Knight for their great work, the Water Diviner tells a magical tale and reminds us what wars do to people, to families.. and to our humanity. I cannot imagine anyone who won't be touched by this film, touched very deep inside, that is. Whoever that ever loved somebody or lost a beloved one –sibling, parent, child, significant other, or friend, you name it– may have their heart shattered during certain scenes of the Water Diviner.Apart from the story, the characters too felt so 'real', and the cast performances were nothing short of what one would expect from such brilliant names. Russell Crowe, as always, seemed to 'live' the role, not 'just act' it.. and I'm so very glad that Cem Yilmaz has been in such a special project. In an attempt to keep my review as short as possible, and choosing to comment on acting after I see the movie more than once, I won't go into detail of each and every name. But.. I have to say that Ryan Corr's performance was outstanding! He and James Fraser certainly nailed it, causing a flood of tears among the audience –during a certain scene of this duo, I could hear sniffles and see shoulders shaking among the audience.. and I'm not exaggerating one bit. Speaking of the scenes that certainly leave a mark on the viewer, I'd like to say that certain scenes from the battle field were spectacular – both technically and artistically. The scenes are so 'real' that they take you from your seat and put you on Lone Pine battlefield , feeling scared.. helpless.. angry.. and questioning what a war is.. and if it's even worth it. And then, there is a specific scene which reflect how a war can make people lose their humanity and surface the ferocity of human nature. As my favorite scene from the epic Noah, the creation scene, reminded us all: 'Brother against brother. Nation against nation. Man against the creation. We murdered each other. We broke the world, we did this. Man did this.'The fascinating art is not limited to battle scenes, though. Andrew Lesnie simply works miracles, turning the movie into a feast for the eyes –from the dust storm in Australia to the breath-taking views of Istanbul, the Water Diviner presents top-quality cinematography *thumbs up* Before I wrap up my words on this beautiful piece of art, I'd like to mention two of the many special scenes which may well be extra-touching for the Turkish: i) The scene where Jemal (portrayed by Cem Yilmaz) raises a toast to Mustafa Kemal: During the screening at the Istanbul premiere, the audience responded to this by loud and clear applause, and it certainly will remain an unforgettable scene for many, many Turks. ii) Another special part of the movie that I really loved is the old Turkish folk song Jemal sings –an old song called 'hey fifteen year olds', telling the story of 15 year old boys leaving home to join the battle of Gallipoli.Taken together, the Water Diviner tells a tale of love mingled with adventure, delivers a sea of emotions from grief to hope, and works the magic of cinema, reaching the viewers' heart and mind in a way that crosses all barriers of language, different cultures, politics, and history.PS: the Water Diviner was rewarded standing ovation, and I believe this was not only because it's a great movie, it was also a heart-felt 'thank you' to the director for such an honest story which the Turkish audience isn't used to seeing in foreign films about Turkey and its history.Kudos and hats off to Russell Crowe & the entire cast and crew. The Water Diviner (Turkish title: Son Umut, i.e. 'the Last Hope') is a spectacular movie, a must-see, a masterpiece.",9,220,309,27 December 2014
The Woman in Black," Successfully Creepy
","My expectations for 'The Woman In Black' were neither high nor low, and I was curious about Radcliffe's first non-Potter performance. He surely did a good job, might not be the best actor out there, but he did well in this movie. In addition to trying to keep us back from thinking about Harry, the role itself was another challenge for Daniel as it was mainly focused on his character and he handled it well, even during the several minutes when the film flows without one single word. His moves and expressions did the talking through those parts, if I may say so. Sadly, not many 'new' actors manage to use body language these days, therefore hats off to Harry -oops, Daniel, I meant. As for the movie, it's good. It doesn't necessarily make you sh!t in your pants, but keeps you concentrated and tense through the whole time. For a story adapted from a play, it has a perfect flow and makes sense overall, something that doesn't always happen with these kind of thrillers. It's creepy in a good way, contains almost all of the classical aspects without making it too cliché or boring. Most importantly, from first moment on it makes you feel like you're gonna flinch any given moment and this is done professionally, with the background music, the very successful movie-set and good directing. The ending is also good, and does not disappoint. All in all, The Woman In Black reminds us that ghost stories can be much more attractive than the recent blood-full, poor plotted so-called horror movies.",6,0,1,11 March 2012
The Ugly Truth," Witty, funny, fun!
","The Ugly Truth is a fun movie with a very good flow, a well-chosen pair to reflect the leading characters successfully and many funny (even hilarious) parts that make you laugh out loud. It lasts about 1 and a half hour only, and still manages to deliver the plot in its entirety, make sense and certainly entertain you. Almost each and every dialogue between Abby (Katherine Heigl) and Mike (Gerard Butler) is filled with adult jokes or implies sexual content, but it achieves to keep it at a good quality and does not go down to a cheap level or end up in boring clichés. I for one would recommend it to all those looking for a light, fun movie anyday, just to have a good laugh (or two).",6,3,6,2 July 2012
Gladiator," Epic
","I've seen this movie countless times and am pretty sure I'll re-watch it many more times. Needless to say, it's one of my all time favorite movies, and I believe it deserves all the popularity, awards and positive comments. Gladiator brings you all that you can possibly expect from its genre. It takes you to a different time and place and tells an epic fairy tale of a true hero. Director does justice to the plot and characters make the story proud. Russell Crowe is exceptionally great in this film with pure talent and amazing chemistry with his character, and in fact the whole cast seems perfect. All in all, this is a movie I'd gladly recommend to anyone without a doubt. It really is a classic of our time.",10,1,2,24 August 2013
