Alien 3," Great film (may contain some spoilers)
","Though it doesn't have the Intense suspense of the original or the dazzling visuals of the second. Alien 3 Delivers something of it's own and is a strong installment to the series. First of all, the best moments of the film are in fact not the one's with the title character but instead the character development areas.This film has an incredible soundtrack, and focuses less on the frightening areas of the beast but instead on the disturbing parts.The director may not be as experienced or mainly as good as Ridley Scott or James Cameron, but He really knows how to make these scenes exciting. One of my favorite moments in film of all time was when the alien goes up to ripley and does nothing. Or when the Alien First attacks and boggs get covered with blood. Or when Ripley asks to be killed and that moment with one high note for music, It really works.",Null,0,2,20 September 2003
Fight Club," A club over the head
","This is a shocking film. Brad Pitt is perfect as a cool, psycotic rebell. A movie with awesome fight scenes, a perfect cast, philosophy that makes sense for once, a non-predictably gripping storyline, awesome graphics and a relation to the audience that is not hard to see, but not to open either. Fight Club is by far the best movie I have ever seen. I think it was under credited at awards. Any one who thinks it is too brutal doesn't see the beauty of this film. A perfect 10!!",Null,0,1,8 February 2003
Armageddon," I love this show
","I read some of the comments made on this movie, and I don't know what is wrong with a person who would say negative things about this movie. It is awesome. It has action, amazing acting, a sweet soundtrack, tension, excellent visuals, great charcter depth, comedy, and above all powerful triumphant moments. This is one of my personal favorite movies. On my top 3 list. I like moving movies, and this is qualifies.",10,1,2,2 February 2003
Pitch Black," Good, but not great may have spoilers
","Although this movie has some great visuals, awesome acting (especially Vin Diesel) and a pretty sweet plot, it has a tendency to drag on. The Action is spread out immensly. Most of the movie is a feud between character traits. One man being religious, the other a crack doing cop who would sacrifice other lives just to bring in a murder convict. I'm not complaining about the characters because I love them, but this movie is tedious in many parts. You should go see it but do not expect to much from it or you might be a little dissapointed.",8,0,0,11 February 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," review of THE TWO TOWERS spoiler
","First of all if you haven't seen the movie (or the commercials) here is how it goes. Frodo and Sam are off to mordor when they get lost and are found by gollem. (Andy Serkis; does an awesome job! worth the time and the money!) He shows them the way. At the same time Aragorn and company are getting ready for an attack from 10,000 orcs, and the other hobbits are trying to get the ents to go to war. put it all together you get a sweet movie. The most asked question about this movie, for me anyways, is it better then the first one. Well yes and no. There just different which makes all that much better. Personally I think that the battles in the first one were alot more suspensful, but the ones in TTT are alot more visually taking. The music in TTT is alot better. The fellowship sticks alot more to the books. The fellowship sort of drags on a little bit more, while TTT is more fast paced. The only thing I really don't like in TTT is the acting of the hobbits. Thier characters changed way to quickly. Sam went from friendly to a pain. Frodo wasn't supposed to go psycho till the next movie. Merry and pippin aren't even funny, but thats made up for by Gimli (john ryse davies), and there is a little humor from gollem.(but not much) The best parts of the movie were the ones with gollem or Gandalf, because gollem was just a sweet acting job, and gandalf does some cool stuff.",10,0,0,1 February 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Best Film of the New Millenium (spoilers?)
","Kill Bill, A film with a simple plot taken to new heights. Making you get into the film from the very first black and white shot Of Uma Thurman bloody and dying on the floor followed by a gunshot and the well placed song 'Bang Bang.' My comment on it being the best film of the new millenium is true. Over the past four years the market has been invaded with horribly made preteen flicks and movies that wouldn't hold you on the edge of your seat if your life depended on it. Even the Academy Awards has sunk to nominations of depressingly bad films. But this is a breakthrough. With some of the greatest cinematography scince The Shawshank Redemption or even citizen kane, and characters, that in any other film would be cartoony and unbelieved, are believable because of Tarantino's genius.Even the chief opposing characters are somewhat cared for in this movie. Plus an actual good cliffhanger, unlike the horribly written ending of the Matrix Reloaded(To be Concluded)!!! But then again its not for everyone. Don't bring your kids to it! And if your looking for another pulp fiction well you might be dissapointed. Not saying that its bad just its not the same style. A 10 and possibly even 11.",10,2,5,29 October 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," perfection
","This is movie making at it's best. This movie has no flaws. Unlike other movies in it's category this is niether slow moving nor boring. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. It has excellent characters, a moving theme, and subplots that are more intense then some movies alone. Morgan Freeman has the best narration of all narrations. The music is inspiring. I especially like the opening of the movie. Starting with his conviction then going on to Morgan Freemans character, and conecting the two with the line 'when andy dufrain asked me to get him rita haywrith, I said fine.' Then the splendid shot of the prison. (personally my favorite cinematographic achievment ever)",10,1,1,2 February 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Emotionally Grabbing.....(spoilers i guess)
","My @$$.This movie sucked big time. Yes there were graphics. Yes there were themes. Yes Sean Astin knows how to cry like a pansy. No, there was absolutely no good acting whatsoever. Everybody sucked. Elijah Wood is the best one. Why? because he did the Kubrick stare. Best part of the whole movie was just him staring at the ring before he went crazy and started to put it on. Everything else was terrible. No suspense at all. Yes a huge army is attacking. Did it effect anyone? Were their hearts beating any faster? If so, you need to see a REAL movie. Like Pulp Fiction, or The Shawshank Redemption, or American Beauty, or A Clockwork Orange, or basically any Stanley Kubrick Movie Ever. The fact that Peter Jackson is even nominated for Best Director is god damn insulting. While Quentin Tarantino and Tim Burton are left out in the cold. Not to mention poor Stanley Kubrick, who never got a single directing award from the damn Academy. If Jackson wins, I will never watch Oscars again.",Null,0,1,11 February 2004
Princess Mononoke," Touching
","(May contain spoilers) This is not one of your typical cartoons. This is a movie about a young man named Ashitaka. In the early parts of the movie a demon boar attacks his village. He fights off the demon but is touched by it causing him to have a curse. He finds that the curse will spread like a disease and kill him. At the same time the curse gives him superhuman strength and agility. (Shown by him pushing open a huge door, that would take ten men to open normally, Inspite of a bullet wound) He tries to find a way to cure himself or at least do some good before he dies. Now that is one of the plots. The others include a man looking for a God's head in order to gain eternal life, a woman running an iron making town who is constantly being opposed by other men and the very forces of nature, and a girl raised by a wolf god who tries to protect the forest from the miners. Put Ashitaka in the middle to try and make peace and you've got one of the most excellent animated films ever made. Although the fantasy and bloody violence the movie has a background message that everyone deserves to live no matter how intent they are on destroying their antagonists. The film has an excellent score, incredible animation (especially considering the scenery), very rounded characters, and a wonderful theme to top it off. The only part that is disappointing is the dialogue in the last few minutes of the film is cheesy. Inspite of the small flaw near the end i give this movie an 8.5 /10.",10,0,1,17 February 2003
