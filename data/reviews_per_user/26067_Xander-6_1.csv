Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Kill Jar Jar
","I liked this movie a lot. But please kill Jar Jar. I liked the fighting scenes a great deal. They were much more complex and exciting than the first trilogy. The choreography was excellent and I enjoyed the new score. Most of the actors did an excellent job, even the young Anakin, although he was cheesy from time to time. Natalie Portman is a cutie. I thought the whole 'Anakin is a messianic figure' stuff was a load of donkey puss. Darth Maul was so damn cool. He was an evil cat ready to pounce on those wussy Jedi and open up a can of whoop ass. Unfortunately, he only had a few lines, and was not developed enough. I look forward to more of the Sith race showing up. They are sooooo damn cool. Again, kill Jar Jar. Kill him, and use his stupid amphibious carcass as a throw rug for another Sith lord for his cabin in Aspen. Again, kill Jar Jar. Thank you. Did I mention you should kill Jar Jar?",Null,0,1,20 May 1999
