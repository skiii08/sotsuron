The Blair Witch Project," Excellent Flick
","This movie was a breath of fresh air into the whole genre of Horror Film. Not only did it prove that you dont need blood, gore and a overly predictable bad guy, but it also showed that not every idea has been thought of in film. I really enjoyed it and didnt mind that the movie left with me with more questions than answers.",10,1,2,18 July 1999
