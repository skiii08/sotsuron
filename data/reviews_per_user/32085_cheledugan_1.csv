Kill Bill: Vol. 2," True Blue QT
","Saw both V1 & V2 in the same day and loved it that way.  QT is a visionary and his work here in this film is true to form.  The Chapters, the witty dialogue...the constant need to prove to everyone that he has ADHD.  How can you not, at the very least, be entertained?V2 was certainly slower than the first and a bit condescending to the audience.  The 'lessons' learned - it was an action packed psycho love story if you will.  Casting was superb - I haven't a clue as to how Uma Thurman pulled this off being that she is so tall and lanky - but she did - and she did it better than anyone.  The music complimented the film - a soundtrack to be purchased.My money is still on QT - I think his best is yet to come.",8,0,1,18 April 2004
