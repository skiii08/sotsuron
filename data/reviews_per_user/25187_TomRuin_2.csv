Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," UNDERATED
","I cannot tell you how many times I've watched this movie, i would restart it as soon as it finishes. This movie is the definition of Star Wars. The planets, the scrip, characters & aliens are so unique. The story is amazing but for many hard to understand. Almost everything from this movie is iconic. The scenery and aesthetic of it is one of the best from all the episodes. A great start to the saga !",10,2,3,5 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," LOL
","This movie is honestly laughable, Thank you Disney for this amazing comedy movie ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ i walked out the theatre's after 30 minutes. I miss George Lucas but honestly Star Wars fans deserve this.. you didn't like the prequels well now this is what you get",1,21,36,5 April 2020
