Sucker Punch," Do not wright this off for a couple of days.
","I read a review just now and i thought i would add to it. One reviewer said that after they thought about this film there initial Luke warm reception to this movie was wrong , i agree completetly. The action scenes in this film are breathtaking yes , tense, no i am afraid. And the story is kind of wayward while you watch the film so when you come out of the cinema you feel a bit washed out , a bit like you could have made it a bit better. By the time you get home you start thinking about the story a bit more and you cannot get those lovely ladies out of your head , also one particular action scene on a train is just cinematography porn ,its gorgeous and you just want it to go on forever. It is generally four action scenes split up , but they are fantastic and need to be seen and heard on the big screen , if your waiting for the DVD , even on a good home theatre system , you will miss out heavily. Its very rare i want to go and see a movie at the cinema twice but yes , i want suckerpunch heaven again.",8,4,9,9 April 2011
Cloverfield," fantastic, fantastic,fantastic.
","Hats off to the makers of this film,I love a good monster movie and am a bit of a sucker for a disaster film , and boy! does this film deliver on both attempts. I was looking forward to this film and have been following it for the past six months so it could only have been a let down if it was not perfect , and i LOVED it. From the opening scenes you know this is not the usual Hollywood fodder and you are drawn into the characters world as you live and breath there experience. I do not wish to spoil anything that this film dishes out so just go and enjoy this genius of a film , but a word to the warning , if you did not like the blair witch project and hated that style of storytelling and cinematography then you might not get on with this film as its very similar. Whether its a happy or sad ending your looking for then this film will keep you guessing , please,please try to avoid any script or plot that you may want to see , keep yourself guessing?",10,4,8,3 February 2008
Silent Hill," fantastic vision of a great game!
","Silent hill is possibly the greatest game to movie tie in that i have ever witnessed. The plot covers the games 1 and 2 very well and the character is very similar to the woman in no.3 , ms mitchell is cast very well as the mom trying find her little girl cast away in the creepy ghost town of silent hill. Thank goodness uwe boll did not get his hands on this title , otherwise it would have been a travesty , Christopher ganz's vision of this video game is of the highest quality and he has obviously seen and probably played theses games as there are so many nods to the actual games that you loose count , one BIG nod i noticed was the camera angle as Rhona first steps down into hell , exactly the same , brilliant!! Please forget the haters and watch this film , creepy , well acted and a lovely fluffy ending (not!!) , enjoy!.",8,0,1,21 August 2006
Spirited Away," a charming and fantastical cult classic
","This very simply (argueably)is one of the finest movies ever made.!!!Because this film is a 'cartoon' it is discarded by most cinema\movie goers and is a real travesty because it is a touching and memorable story that invlolves a little girl that stumbles into a world of magic and fantastical surroundings who has to find and free her parents that has been turned into pigs by an evil dictator(witch). Her adventure is helped by a boy that can turn into a dragon and various other strange and wonderful creatures. The story whips along at a great pace and everyone that i manage to persuade to watch this film always are confused by the fact that they have never heard of it or studio ghibli(the studio that produces this and many other great classics).Why are great classics like this not rewarded with the publicity they deserve and require here in the west? , i am quite sure that in its native country these films are greatly loved. I suggest to you that spirited away should be watched by everyone ,as a story as good as this one should NEVER be missed , this is a definite ten out of ten. Watch, enjoy and be spirited away to a place that you will want to come back to again and again.",10,1,2,25 June 2006
The Descent," best horror in years?
","this film is of the highest quality and comes from the same director as dog soldiers (overated guff?) , it is one of the most edge of seat horrors you will EVER see and the cast do a very good job of looking panicky and confused most of the film , it is a film of two halves , the first being a great claustrophobic build up to a more standard horror monster film at the end (although this is very well done). I do not wish to give any more of this film away so just go see it , PLEASE go see it, as i think this has many avenues for a good sequel , and if it does well in the states.................who knows!!!?? (You must,must,must see this on the big screen)",10,0,2,25 June 2006
