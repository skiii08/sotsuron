Deja Vu," Unfortunate choice for DW's CV
",Seems like Denzel is bored while making this film. The idea behind the story is very weak and very naive. The cast is not really playing any important role. The bad guy is not developed as a character. Kilmer is not axistent. The plot has many huge Wholes! The girl is not attractive enough. All in all a very average outcome for what Washington is able to do.,4,0,3,6 April 2019
