Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The sun's still shining in Tarantino, USA...
","I've never been a big fan of Tarantino films. I watched 'Jackie Brown' a few years back, heard good things about 'Reservoir Dogs' and watched the first half hour or so of 'Pulp Fiction'. Enough said.I came to 'Kill Bill Vol. 1' primarily as an outsider. I had sort of an idea who was in it, what the tone was and that it was meant to be a homage to '70s Hong Kong martial art flicks. And as an outsider I thought it was really good; it was enjoyable. So, I'm expecting the same for 'Vol. 2'. Because I figure 'Terminator 2' wasn't a 120 minute talkie, and in fact built upon the action and the violence of the first, and 'Vol. 2' will be the same. How wrong I was. As a non-Tarantino fan, you can enjoy the first film. As a non-Tarantino fan, you'll be falling asleep in front of 'Vol. 2'. There's 30 minutes of talk...just talk, mind you...and Bill is dispatched very easily at the end (I'm glad that actually happened, otherwise I would have given the film a 0). I'm willing to give the first film an 8 (yes, I'm that generous. Though I don't think I can give the second more than a 3. It was a waste of time, and nothing like I thought it would be.But, apparently, this is how Tarantino makes movies. He makes Tarantino movies for Tarantino fans. He's a great filmmaker, I'll give him that and the first film was spectacular. But the second film felt more like an episode of 'Days of Our Lives' with one decent fight scene. Don't waste your time, I say. Fortunately for Tarantino though, he can do no wrong, and unlike Uwe Boll fans will continue to flock to his movies and praise him. Non-fans, however, will probably be tuned out for good after 'Vol. 2'. What a waste...",3,0,3,24 August 2006
Mission: Impossible III," Mission: Failed...
","I suppose (continuing on the whole humorless pun thing) it's not 'Mission: Interesting III' or 'Mission: Exciting III' or even 'Mission: Enjoyable III'. No, it's 'Mission: Impossible III', a film - like its predecessors - with enough star power to sink 'Titanic' and a budget greater than that of the GDP of most second-world nations.And it's not really interesting. Or enjoyable. It's like a less interesting version of Arnold Schwarzenegger's 'Eraser', or a Steven Seagal film without Steven Seagal. We have a WMD (I suppose it's a WMD...it could be a very flash martini shaker for all I we're told...), a kidnapped fiancé (the staple of a few Jean-Claude van Damme films funnily enough, apart from the, '...they killed his family...now he's OUT FOR REVENGE!!!' which is the staple of all the other JCVD films...), crooks in the agency (wasn't that in 'xXx: State of the Union'?) and all sort of useless, boring action scenes and gloss special effect that are...amazingly...used as FILLER between the even more useless, uninteresting character building scenes. And the worse part is, after plodding along for all this amount of time, it seems as if the directed check his watch and though, 'Ooh, better rap this up!' and thought up some gimmicky way of ending it all (and THANK GOD it's not longer than two hours like 'M:I 2').Overall: A B-grade script (Seagal would probably jump at it, actually), A-grade 'talent' (Oxymoron #1,156) and some of the most boring, 'seen-it-a-hundred-times-before' action sequences ever filmed.If you're looking for an engaging, exciting and CLEVER (as CLEVER as action/thrillers are in this day and age) piece of entertainment, forget this - and rent Keifer Sutherland's '24'. You'll thank me later...",3,1,2,1 March 2007
50 First Dates," Worst Romantic Comedy. Ever.
","Yes, I know this is just one person's opinion, and I'm sure you'll disagree and radda radda, yadda yadda etc. But hear me out.I was a fan of Adam Sandler's earlier movies. 'Billy Madison' and 'Happy Gilmour' were funny films, and you weren't expected to take them too seriously. '50 First Dates' is different though.Let's have a run down of what I didn't like (it's my prerogative, after all). Adam Sandler isn't really suited to the part. He's a bit of a goof, and I find it hard to take him seriously (in 'Anger Management', okay, but I was rooting for Jack Nicholson the whole time :P). Same goes for Will Ferrell and 'Bewitched'. Secondly, the script is uninspired. Mundane. Average. There's nothing special about it and it sort of teeters between the outrageous, over-the-top comedies like 'Billy Madison' and 'Happy Gilmour' that I liked Adam Sandler in and the more serious romantic comedies. It's like it can't decide what it wants to be. Drew Barymore is Drew Barymore. She's just a character, and her role could be filled by anyone, really (ie. Sandra Bullock, Cameron Diaz, Tea Leoni etc.). Rob Scheider is really, really bad comedy relief. He's like Adam Sandler's on-screen stand-in, and it gets old really fast. The concept is, half the time, taken far too seriously and the other half not seriously enough.'50 First Dates' wants to be like 'Blind Date' (one of Bruce Willis' first films, and also featured Kim Bassinger). In fact, they are very similar films. But in the end, '50 First Dates' comes off more like 1) a TV soap (it's mushy, it's clichéd and we've seen it all before) and 2) like 'Scary Movie' (it's all tongue-in-cheek, we're not supposed to take it seriously etc.). And it just can't make it work. I like Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, but even their presence can't save this movie. It's too muddled, too divided to be enjoyable.",3,3,8,27 October 2006
United 93," Maybe too soon, but certainly gripping...
","Is it too soon for a film about September 11? Maybe. One thing's for sure, though, 'United 93' is definitely a good thing.The film is, among other things, interesting, gripping, physically and mentally draining and frighteningly realistic. Though it lacks the emotional impact I expected (with the exception of the film's sudden and quite subdued ending), it certainly provides a great insight into at least one part of the September 11 tragedy. The acting is consistently good and convincing, and the whole film is very believable. So believable, in fact, that it often feels more like a documentary than a movie.Not wanting to be overly critical (as this is a sensitive subject), I couldn't help but feel, as I watched the film, that I was watching a group of extras. Not because there are no 'big name' stars or because the actors are unconvincing; quite the opposite in fact. The problem is, I felt as if I was watching 'background actors'. It's very hard to associate with any of the characters (or rather people) because of this, and as such a lot of the emotional impact is dulled.The film is not so much enjoyable as interesting, and with its high production values, believable characters and shocking realism should satisfy those who believe it is not too soon. For me, personally, the most shocking and emotionally devestating part of this movie is the footage of the Twin Towers burning. That affects me more deeply that any Hollywood film ever could, no matter how good.Six Stars.",6,1,2,11 September 2006
Being John Malkovich," A pathetic, confusing and above all disturbing mess...
","Ugh. What an absolutely overrated film. Firstly, it's strange. And secondly, it's not funny...except one scene where a motorist throws an empty beer can at John Malkovich's head (that got me laughing).It's the sort of film that critics rant and rave about, though really I can't see why. A man discovers a 'portal' (it's more like a tunnel really) into John Malkovich's head and uses him as a puppet to, among other things, have sex with this co-worker of his. But it turns out that a group of body-jumping Scientology-types need his body to continue living, and the man may be forced to give it all up...Or something. Who cares. The plot to this movie was possibly lost in the before-mentioned tunnel. Because, really, there's nothing that memorable about this film. John Malkovich as John Malkovich is rather humdrum (except for the fact he's fun to watch and has a handful of good lines). John Cusack and Catherine Keener are both average actors, and neither of them turns in a particularly likable performance. Charlie Kaufman is a talented writer and did wonders with 'Adaptation', but this film just isn't worth the hype. Original, yes, but funny? No. Rewatchability? Zero. It feels like a porno, and probably wouldn't of even got a mention if it had been, say, 'Being Ice Cube'.What a waste...",2,8,15,9 August 2006
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Somewhat disappointing
","I thought that the original Resident Evil was quite good, and have seen what the games have to offer. If the producers, directors etc. had put more of what's in the games into the film then Apocalypse would have been halfway decent. Instead, we get much of what we had in the first - but no where as good. The zombies play a minor part in the film, the Lickers appear for a very, very short time and we have the dogs: again. The film may have been okay if it had included some of the suspense, isolation and gore that the original had but the sequel lacks a lot of this. I would have rather watched a film that had yet another group of hapless victims entering the Hive and getting slaughtered...",3,9,15,18 March 2005
