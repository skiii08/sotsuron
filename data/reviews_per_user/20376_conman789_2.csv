Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Tarantino's Brilliant Homage to the Classics Overlooked by the Fatuous Academy
","Kill Bill Volume 2 is brilliant, although you really do have to have a vast knowledge of films to appreciate it for what it is - a great homage to cult cinema/filmmaking.  The references are everywhere - the whole master/disciple relationship of Pai Mei (Gordan Liu) and the Bride (reminiscent of Liu's 1978 36th Chamber of Shaolin - probably the best martial arts film ever made).  Also, the Leone-esque narrative construct with long, drawn out takes.  All the close-ups of feet (similar to De Palma's infatuation with hands).  Even the whole buried alive sequence and rising from the grave conjures up images of De Palma's Body Double/Carrie. This film is true brilliance, and is a great end to an epic revenge saga. The only problem I had with it, was that I was so disappointed that it was over.",10,1,2,17 April 2004
Hustle & Flow," Whoop That Trick GET EM Whoop That Trick GET EM......
","This little gem was one of the few surprises of the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, and was certainly the best film in American Dramatic Competition (along with 'Brick' and 'Thumbsucker').Yes, the plot is riddled with clich√©s - but the film manages to transcend these shortcomings due to the slick camera-work of cinematographer Amy Vincent (who won the cinematography award at Sundance), the powerful and poignant performances by Terrence Dashon Howard in the title role (Djay), Taraji P. Henson (Shug), and, of all people, Anthony Anderson (Key).The film follows a down-and-out Memphis pimp/hustler named Djay (Howard), who, along with his 'primary investor' ho Nola (Taryn Manning), run tricks out of his beat-up Caddie in a back alley.Djay is then swept up in the crunk-rap game, with the emerging success of hometown Memphis product Skinny Black (Ludacris). Djay was once a DJ/freestyle MC during his formative years, and, in his opinion, was on a par with Skinny. So Djay, frustrated by life as a pimp/hustler/dirt-weed dealer, decides to break into the rap game. He's aided by an old friend Key (Anderson), who's still kept his rap-dream alive by recording gospel music at the local church, and his sidekick Shelby (DJ Qualls), who's got some ill crunk beats.Djay's pregnant 'first lady' Shug (Henson) provides the hook to their second single ('You know it's hard out here for a pimp / when you trying to get the money for the rent / all the Cadillac and gas money spent / will have a whole lot of b*tches jumpin ship'), as well as some much-needed tenderness that helps ground Djay's rough, pimp-slappin character.This film won the Audience Award at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival and rightfully so - it's very engaging and a lot of fun. Even when the sparks fly in the 3rd Act, and filmmaker Craig Brewer throws a left-hook featuring delicate material, the film is redeemed by its close.I enjoyed this film much more than Curtis Hanson's '8 Mile', and must thus crown 'Hustle and Flow' as the greatest rap film ever made.(The title of this post is a reference to Djay's first, catchy single)",9,9,21,6 February 2005
