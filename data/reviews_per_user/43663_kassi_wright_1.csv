It," Loved
","It was a lot better than I imagined it would turn out. The graphics were great and looked very realistic in most parts. This is definitely a family movie to get the laughs and little scares here and there. One thing I would change would to have it slightly more scary, I believe it was the right amount of funny I just would have liked to be scared a little more with this type of movie due to my love for horror movies. Overall I would say they knocked it out the park with this remake and I would recommend this to everyone.",8,1,1,22 December 2017
