Ali," When watching this film, remember that it is an autobiography
","'Ali' was long and a little slow, but just remember that it is an autobiography of Ali.  He went through some slow times in his life that we had to capture as an audience.  With this being said there is a downside that I did not like.  The movie was 2.5 hours long and they still managed to leave years of his life out that was important.  I hated when the words came up and said how Ali managed to loose his title and regain it again in the following 10 years.  Its like they left us hanging for a part 2.  I wanted to see why he retired and what about his family and what he did after boxing.  At least in words at the end if anything.  We all sat through the credits to see if they would show Ali, etc. but they didn't.",7,0,0,27 December 2001
