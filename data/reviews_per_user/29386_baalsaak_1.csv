Love and Death," The Best Ever
","I'm a huge Woody Allen's fan, I may not like everything he does, but for this one I bowed to you, sir.I remember seeing a clip of this movie a really long time ago. back then I had no idea which movie it was, later on came Internet and the world shrank and opened.My only reference was that it was Woody's, developed in Russia, and his character's name: Boris.A few years now, I found it, and had the chance to enjoy, (for me), the best movie I've ever seen. Remembering that I even seen this twice in a row, and it was totally worth it.This movie is for all of us who enjoy really good jokes or just like to see quality films.",10,2,2,9 August 2012
