Hereditary," Hyped up garbage?
","Yes, the acting was great but that's not what I went to the theater for. I wanted some emotion rattled, fear shivering down my spine, and maybe jitters from jump scares. What I got instead was constant laughter from the ridiculousness of how the plot unfolded scene after scene, while constantly wishing inside there will be an amazing plot twist at the end only to be left disappointed.Honestly I still wonder where the ratings on this movie came from. Save your money and your time, go pick an old classic horror and you're bound to have a much greater time.",1,143,297,9 June 2018
