Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," 'Jackass' meets 'Easy Rider'
","This movie works on two levels. It is a Jackass-meets-Easy-Rider for adolescent minds who love crudeness. It may also appeal to more open-minded people who try to find social satire within it and test contemporary limits of decency. Sasha Baron Cohen and his writers don't explore the satire any further than having Borat cluelessly utter and do the most offensive things and showing how Americans react. If repulsive is funny, this movie should be hilarious.Some people on his southern route from New York to L.A. exceed his unassuming crassness, ultra-nationalism, racism, anti-Jewish prejudice, and sexism. Because these Americans are clued in, they are just plain mean. Others show their better natures and either try to assist this bumpkin or draw the line on decency. As bad as the movie makes Kazakhstan look, it sometimes makes the United States look worse. When Borat is at a Pentacostal prayer meeting, watching prominent American citizens in suits, including a judge and members of Congress, speak in tongues and swoon in religious ecstasy, we wonder who is stranger.Yes, you will probably laugh, but there are different reasons for laughter. Sometimes it covers a sense of discomfort from breaking social taboos. Borat just can't get the hang of what to do with a toilet and how it works. Despite intense study with an etiquette coach, he presents a little white plastic bag to the dinner party hostess at the table in front of guests. There's not just nudity, but hairy and obese nudity and fellatio. There is a lot of that kind of laughter in this movie. It makes Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor look mild.That said, the hand-held camera work and editing are very effective for the candid scenes with apparently unsuspecting 'ordinary people.' The 90 minutes passed quickly as I followed with interest to see how many taboos of political correctness Borat would break. I lost count. It began with incest, rape, bestiality, anti-Semitism, male chauvinism and sexism, double fellatio, planning to kill and killing pets, and much more. How this movie got nothing more restrictive than a PG 17 is unbelievable.",5,2,5,4 November 2006
Black Book," Sex and violence aren't enough for a film without meaning
","No question, this is one gripping film. It was hard to believe 2:25 hours had passed, in contrast to the several glances of the watch in about the same amount of time during Spiderman, wishing it would be over.There are high production values. Many millions of Euros or dollars went into blowing up things and make-up for bullet wounds, not to mention the large hanging vat of human feces. Now why would they have suspended it to the ceiling other than for the dramatic value in the script? The suspended scheisse is a metaphor for the plausibility of most of the movie. Good fiction makes sense. Having a strong cast won't carry a shaky script. Director/screenwriter Paul Verhoeven has good command for the sensational, potboiler (Robocop, Showgirls, Basic Instinct), but he is out of his element when he tries to make a definitive statement on the cooperation of Holland's citizens with the Nazis. The reality in Holland as in France as is in the U.S. when power changes from one major political party to the other, some people can land on their feet and get along and go along.We think that of Rachel/Ellis a few times, but she shows her true feelings at least twice: when she throws up in the beginning of her deception and later when she threatens to quit the Resistance if a betraying Dutch police inspector isn't removed from his office. Carice van Houten is eye-grabbing as the endangered Jewish gamine, Rachel Weiss, who later gives herself an all-over hair bleaching to look Teutonic. She has wonderful chemistry with the affable local Gestapo chief Sebastian Koch, who doesn't even raise his voice. The two live together in real life. The double and triple crosses are worthy of Hitchcock, but near the end there are several accusations made, and they are not all resolved, particularly one against the Resistance leader Gerben Kuiypers, whose son Timothy was captured.So many plot points were not worthy of belief: How could a bullet coming from the front just graze Rachel/Ellis forehead and then heal so quickly without a scar? How did Rachel/Ellis get so good a command of German? There are several good incidents of plot foreshadowing, but this isn't one of them. If Muntze is that suspicious of Ellis why doesn't he have her followed when she goes 'home' to get clothes? How could so great a guy as Muntze rise to head to Gestapo in Holland after operations in Poland and France? How could Resistance member and doctor Hans Akkermans (Thom Hoffman)survive so many fire fights even though he shoots without cover, certainly rank-and-file Gestapo couldn't have been trusted with the knowledge? How could Muntze after presumably hearing a full confession from Ellis trust her to continue to work in a sensitive position in Gestapo headquarters? How could Hans have become so silent so quickly when he had been so forceful, heart attack for a man presumably in his late 30s to 40? Whose side was Ronnie on in arranging the final jail break, of Muntze and Ellis? How does Ronnie keep from getting her head shaved by the mob as a Nazi whore? Why would attorney Smaal keep such detailed records in his black book, which could have been a ticket to execution for him and his wife if it had fallen in Nazi hands? And why doesn't Verhoeven ever put a gun in Ellis'/Rachel's hand when she is in mortal danger? Sex and violence makes the time of the movie go quickly, but leave the viewer unsatisfied after its over. There needs to be meaning, too.",7,11,17,7 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," Special FX 10, acting 5 = Eye Candy
","We're not supposed to take this movie seriously. It is comic strip with live actors. I told myself that after each implausible occurrence, contrivance, and camp acting. But the special effects are amazing. It was eye candy, tasty at first, but 2:20 will make you diabetic.Rosemary Harris was wasted as Peter Parker's Aunt May, his mother figure. Her acting brought gravitas and pathos as the aging widow deeply devoted to her nephew. She thought she was in a drama rather than a comic book.Toby Maguire is engaging, if not an expert actor. His moves during his personality change showed a fascinating side of him.Bruce Campbell, who has had cameos in the previous two Spidey flicks, stands out with this shtick as a snooty French maitre d'.The set of Manhattan with apparently some bogus street names is quite realistic.If you're 10 years old, chronologically or otherwise, you're gonna love it!",Null,0,2,4 May 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," Cinematography a delight for the eye
","The cinematography is beautiful both of The City and the fashions. Manhattan hasn't been so lovingly displayed since Woody Allen.Meryle Streep turns Miranda Priestly into a three-dimensioned and complex character, not the flat evil persona of the original novel. Streep has never looked more elegant with small waist and arched back. She gets some inspired lines of dialog. It's hard to believe this is the same woman who played a frumpy housewife 11 years ago in Bridges of Madison County. Miranda Priestly will become a classic character of the cinema like Cruella de Ville long after the movie.Anne Hathaway plays Andy Sachs, the bright and eager journalism-school graduate in preppy sweaters skirts who wants to be a journalist, but takes a coveted assistant's job fetching Starbucks to her icon boss, whom she hadn't even known before the interview. That's the easy part of the job, balancing four grandes in a cardboard holder. To Andy falls several Herculean tasks as well. Hathaway's conversational style, wardrobe and body language changes, but she tries to be in that rarefied fashion world, not part of it. Occasionally Miranda lets her know she is pleased, but Andy loses her personal friends, who don't see the distinction. (She's already experienced indulging the whims of her self-absorbed boyfriend who sulks if he feels he's not getting enough attention. Miranda is only a few notches above him.) In the end Andy has to decide whether she is willing to let herself be absorbed by a way of life that sacrifices people for the cause of art and ambition.Stanley Tucci as Nigel, one of Miranda's deputies, is serves as a mentor to Andy. Adrian Grenier,Simon Baker, and Daniel Sunjata are some very eye-catching hunks in contrast to the estrogenic environment.",8,1,2,4 July 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," Shows the edgy and sweet side of family life
","The first third of the film is very difficult to watch. The Hoover family is a Norman Rockwell tableau from Bizarro-land. Each member of the family in Albuquerque, NM, is wildly idiosyncratic. There is fun in the dysfunction with a lot of black humor.The father is the creator of a 'Nine-Point Plan' for success where there are only winners and losers. He's waiting manically for a call from an agent at a convention in Scottdale who is pitching the plan.His father is a sex-obsessed, heroin-snorting senior who seems to say whatever comes to mind.Their teenage son refuses to speak, but says much in short, heavy-handed writing like 'I hate everyone' and 'Welcome to hell.' He has his nose in Nietchze's 'Thus Spake Zarathustra' for most of the movie.The mother's brother is an unemployed Proust scholar with bandages on his wrists from a recent suicide attempt after being spurned by a male graduate student who hooked up with a rival. Steve Carell is outstanding.The mother is an enabler who pretends everything is okay and tries to keep the family functioning. The only light comes from the unsinkable bespectacled,precocious daughter whose optimism and love doesn't quit. She brings out the best in her cynical grandfather and everyone else. Abagail Breslin, a newcomer, gives a memorable performance.Somehow Olive manages to come in as first runner-up in a girls' beauty contest while visiting her mother's sister. She's been spending a lot of time with Grandpa working on a new number for a future contest. Then the fateful call comes: the first-place winner has been disqualified, and Olive is being invited to compete in the finals in Redondo Beach, CA. After weighing the options, the parents decide that the only way they are going to go there is to drive. Dad's old yellow VW bus (without head rests or seat belts) is pressed into service on I-10 for the 700-mile trip. Despite their own personal agendas, they are devoted to Olive and her dream.The trip is also a voyage into the psyche of each of them. The brother and the father are thrown into despair, but Olive in her unassuming way helps them hold on with her innocent love.They make it five minutes late to the pageant. After falling on his knees, the father manages to get the ice-queen director to let the daughter register. The story builds to a climax in this world of preternatural sex kittens. The brother and uncle beg the mother to keep Olive from competing, but the decision falls to Olive.In the end, it is love and loyalty that redeems this family. They committed to be part of this yellow VW Noah's Ark out of devotion to Olive. By the end of the first leg of the trip, they have been transformed. The return trip should be at lot more peaceful.There are some real shortcomings in the premises that take a lot of suspension of belief. As a former VW bus owner, I know the mechanical details are not plausible. The VW bus' transmission fails, so the father is advised to get the bus rolling up to 20 mph so he can shift into 3rd gear. There are many laughs as the family members run and push and then jump into the side opening, but clearly the van is not moving faster than 5 mph. Then the script departs from verisimilitude when the father has to deal with a funeral home in California that is nothing close to reality. It couldn't have happened in one afternoon to make a report, get clearance of the medical examiner, and complete a cremation and have the ashes returned. I'm not carping, tho, the depth of human interactions makes up for these shortcomings.",Null,1,4,20 August 2006
Dreamgirls," Overwhelming, spectacular and gritty!
","This is one of the best adaptions of a Broadway musical I've ever seen. The chiefly African-American audience I watched the movie with was equally blown away. We laughed, gasped, sniffled and applauded--even applauded a celluloid image--in the same places. Why not? This is a story of how black music was whitened.The screenplay employs an interesting technique of starting a song as part of the plot with the characters are in regular clothes and then continuing it with full production values with glitzy costumes, wigs, lighting and audience on stage.Dreamgirls is like Ray with big production numbers. It shows the gritty side as well as the glamor of show business as daring performers attempted to break through beyond race music to the chiefly white audience of pop, where the money is. The performers are currently advised to 'lighten it' (that is less racy with less lust and less pelvic writhing) to be commercial. Still, their original songs are covered by even lighter artists, not just more pop black stars, but even whites.The script, by director, Bill Condon, and book, by Tom Eyen, make the point, who introduced the song 'Hound Dog', written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, both white? No, it wasn't Elvis, but Big Momma Thornton, in 1953.We soon see that it isn't even enough to have a catchy song, but how much the promoter pays to have the record played on the radio. These are the days before Congress outlawed payola.With all the wonderful accolades given to the Dreamgirls, all well deserved, Eddie Murphy emerges as did Jaimie Foxx in Ray, as very musical and a superb performer. While Ray stayed close to his piano, Murphy as the composite character James 'Thunder' Early, with a cap to cover the space between his front teeth, struts in satin pants and runs the gamut from rhythm & blues of Curtis Mayfield and Smokey Robinson, boogie, and finally to raucous soul of James Brown. He skips over the social-commentary stage of Marvin Gaye because he and the 'girls' can't sell it to their agent. Who knew Murphy could pull this off, we can assume with Condon's direction? Early is a tragic figure who tries hard to crossover and appeal to 'the kids' as the popular sounds change quickly from the mid-1960s into the next decade.The score by Henry Krieger and lyrics by Tom Eyen takes the Dreamettes through local Detroit R & B for what was then called Negro race music to audiences to a lighter Motown sound to appeal to the white kids, who buy records and show tickets, and then through the flower-child era of the late 1960s to definitely Caucasian disco in the 1970s. There is a very realistic scene in what looks very much like the Fontainebleau Hotel's night club in Miami Beach where the Dreamgirls get their big break in front of a white, mainly Jewish audience, which accepts them as it did in the late 1960s for the Supremes and Diana Ross.There are many glances and nonverbal reactions that make the film quite clever. The director, in this case Condon, is usually responsible. These glances sometimes, but not always, can be seen on the Broadway stage. Condon translated into the big screen the direction and choreography of the late Michael Bennett.Unlike Murphy, Jamie Foxx puts away his musical chops for the role of suave Cadillac dealer and then agent for the Dreamettes and soon Early, Curtis Taylor Jr. He renames them the Dreamgirls, makes them sound less black and, and breaks through to white venues soon after the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which abolished segregation in public accommodations. He's the closest thing to Berry Gordy, Jr., who created the Motown sound.Songwriter and composer 'C.C.' (Clarence Conrad) White, younger brother to big-voiced Effie White of the Dreamettes, is memorably played by Keith Robinson. He is a composite of the teams of Holland-Dozier-Holland and Leiber-Stoller, cranking out those hits. He can lighten the boogie, but draws a line at disco.Not enough can be said about the women. Effie as the largest Dreamgirl with the biggest voice and most attitude is played by American-Idol reject Jennifer Hudson, who should win many awards for her work. First Taylor replaces her for the slimmer and blander Deena (Beyonce' Knowles) so that Effie, who can do the runs and the belting, must sing backup with the youngest, Lorrell (Anika Noni Rose). Then she is told that her absenteeism and lateness is causing her to be bounced from the group for not being professional (we later learn that she had a good reason). Since Effie loves him Taylor and they have a relationship, she realizes that she is being forced to give up both ties. She registers her protest in the show stopping number which ends act one of the play.The previews of 'And I'm Telling You, I'm Not Going,' gave the impression that she screams her head off in the number. Not so, at least not right away. She takes a long time to build to the climax. She arrives shortly before the Dreamettes open in Miami Beach to learn that she has been replaced by a slim, curvaceous black singer. Michelle (Sharon Leal). Effie starts the song quietly and hurtfully. Taylor stops and listens, and a dolly camera makes rings around her. He finally turns and leaves, and Effie (Hudson) sings a musical tantrum. When she's done, our audience, seemingly emotionally spent, broke out into strong applause for the screen. I couldn't have been the only one with goosebumps.There's plenty of laughter, too, from Early and from the looks. Most of us left 2 hours 11 minutes later emotionally drained.",10,1,4,26 December 2006
Inside Man," A rare, intelligent movie
","It is like 'Do the Right Thing' meets 'Dog Day Afternoon' meets 'Mission Impossible' meets Alfred Hitchcock. Unlike MI, however, the many fast-paced plot twists and turns make sense. There are pauses for social lessons as Spike Lee can deliver them. The cinematographer takes our eyes on an architecture tour of exteriors and interiors. Denzel Washington is superb as a underpaid, middle-level detective with enough sense to know that he is being conned all the way around, by his city as well as the 'perps.' Clive Owen is fascinating as the cool and cerebral mastermind. Memorable performances by Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer, too, as steely cool aristocrats. The plot structure is made more complex with flash-forwards, but they can be followed. We never find out how this plot came to be hatched, but we can surmise when we discover all the conspirators. By all rights, this film should be rewarded next year as Crash was rewarded for teaching about race relations. We'll see.",9,2,3,9 April 2006
The Da Vinci Code," This movie is definitely not boring, just bogus
","New York Times critic A. O. Scott filed one of the first reviews of this movie, from the Cannes Film Festival on Thursday the day before opening. The film was not released ahead of time to reviewers, which, by conventional wisdom, signals a turkey. Scott kvetched about how boring it was. There is no ennui. The film kept me jumping with ambushes, chases and plot twists to keep my adrenalin level high. The contrasting scenes between 21st century Europe and medieval Europe in flashbacks are eye-catching. Hanks is low key, but he's usually low key, whether he's a high school teacher turned captain overwhelmed by battle and responsibility or a lone castaway on a Pacific island using assorted washed-up cargo items like a deflated basketball to keep his sanity.If you want to see how bogus Dan Brown's story is, check out the History Channel this week for programs on Opus Dei, Leonardo DaVinci and other topics suggested by the story. How much more powerful this story would have been if it were more grounded in fact! And certainly a case can be made from facts in the Gnostic gospels and other sources for all that is suggested. There has to be worldwide hunger for a better understanding of the Christian mythic monopoly given how a book with such awkward writing could sell some 65 million copies.",Null,1,5,22 May 2006
The Good Shepherd," Confusing and intriguing
","The movie jumps back and forth in time periods. Sometimes we're lucky enough to get a TV image of President Kennedy in the Cuban Missle Crisis to know that we've suddenly entered the time-warp from the 1940s to 1961. Other times, there is no such clue such as a jump of probably a few hours or days such as when a perfidious German woman assistant gets her just reward. We don't know whether to dispatch those assassins with silencers on their pistols after the screenplay writer or the film editor.The scope of the film, while seeming grand at first as it sweeps quarter century, turns out to be rather microcosmic with a series of vignettes instead of a unified story line. The focus remains mainly on the effect of the cloak and dagger on one man, Edward Wilson Sr., and his wife and son and the conflict of loyalties to country and family. Since the account is fictionalized history, we're not sure what to accept as biography and history as we watch the homo-erotic, cross-dressing elite WASPy Yale camaraderie turn into boys playing with big toys and geopolitics. Wilson, apparently pattered after James Jesus Angleton, is bred to elitism and public service from childhood and matriculates to Yale in the late 1930s to make the necessary career connections.The good shepherd lays down his life for his flock, according to a parable of Jesus. After Allies win World War II, wartime intelligence, among them the fictional Wilson and his classmates, continue their work as shepherds to keep the Free World free, or at least a reasonable facsimile.'Central Intelligence Agency' consumes their lives as did their Yale secret society 'Skull and Bones,' which reportedly has the loyalties of Presidents Bush 41 and 43 and Sen. John Kerry, among other government and business leaders. Why isn't 'the' used with the name of the agency? We're told it is because 'the' isn't used for God either.The film is nonetheless interesting for its strong acting by the studied taciturnity of Matt Damon and the effete professor Michael Gambon with a secret life. The ethnic portrayals add some color to the white bread. Director Robert DeNiro mugs in a role reminiscent of 'Wild Bill' Donovan, a lone Catholic wary of recruiting others for agency. Joe Pesci is, what else?, the Italian mobster in Florida. John Tuturro is the street-smart Italian army sergeant Ray Brocco, who follows Wilson to the CIA to bruise his knuckles as an interrogator. Angela Jolie transforms from a lusty patrician daughter looking for husband material among her brother's Yalie classmates to a long-suffering wife in pearls. Alec Baldwin is the ubiquitous G-man in trench-cost.There are a number of lesser-known actors in the ensemble who were superb like Laura (Tammy Blanchard), the deaf woman at Yale who is the only one who brings out love from Edward Wilson Sr. Mark Ivanir and John Sessions as dueling defectors were especially memorable as was Oleg Stefan as Wilson's Soviet counterpart.",8,34,48,26 December 2006
The Queen," The Queen rules
","Helen Mirren delivers an overwhelmingly nuanced performance of the ruling monarch, HM Queen Elizabeth II, an institution of more than half a century. The actress may have earned a footnote in acting history as the only actress to play Elizabeth I and II in one year for different productions.Michael Sheen s Tony Blair as a twitchy, adoring green prime minister who seems to get a headache every time he telephones the queen. He makes it easy to understand how the real Blair could have become 'Bush's Poodle' in supporting the Iraqi invasion.James Cromwell as the dull Consort Prince Phillip and Alex Jennings as the tearful ex-husband and prince, heir to the throne. who seeks to smash tradition, round out an excellent cast.Director Stephen Frears and Writer Peter Morgan make us feel we are really flies on the wall in Buckingham and Balmoral palaces and at 10 Downing Street. They create a British West Wing. As a Yankee, I don't know how accurate they are, but I'd like to believe that Her Majesty as a mechanic during The War can really diagnose front-end damage to her Land Rover after she wrecks it crossing a stream.",9,0,1,18 December 2006
La Vie En Rose," This movie is worth seeing for the leading actress
","Marion Cottillard as the 'The Little Sparrow' (La Mome) is the main reason to see this film about the short and tempestuous life of Edith Piaf.The movie is not as dramatic as Piaf's life. Born in December 19, 1915, She sang in the streets of Belleville district of Paris, following the footsteps of her mother. She married at 17 and had a daughter, who succumbed to meningitis two years later. Accounts portrayed her as a dutiful mother despite her trying to build a singing career on the streets. Soon Louis Leple'e discovered her strong voice as she sang on the street in the Pigalle district and booked her in an elegant cabaret on the Champs Elysee Boulevard, La Gerny. He gave her the nickname of La Mome. Then Leple'e was murdered.A new agent, Raymond Asso, and other husbands and lovers followed. She attracted talented singers, actors and songwriters. She was a devoted friend who put her own career on hold to mentor young singers like Yves Montand, her lover, and Charles Azvanour. Marlene Dietrich was a close friend. Piaf called world boxing champion Marcel Cerdant the love of her life, although they could not marry because he had a wife and three children. He perished in a plane crash in October, 1949. She investigated spiritualism and mediums to communicate with him.Despite her addiction to morphine for pain and alcohol, liver disease, and severe arthritis compounded by two car crashes, Piaf returned to the stage in 1955 at the Olympia in Paris and Carnegie Hall in New York, where she was the first variety singer to appear at the classic-music venue.It is not the script that is melodramatic, but Piaf's life. Nonetheless she remained positive with her lifelong love and generosity for people, her religious faith, and her devotion to music. She passed at 47, leaving a very worn body.Cotilliard portrays a shy, gamine singer to a severely debilitated woman who can barely walk, shaving her hairline and her eyebrows. Her lip-synching is very realistic. She dominated the movie. The story line zig zags with way too many flashbacks. Fortunately dates in supra titles help.",Null,3,4,25 June 2007
