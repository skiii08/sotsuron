Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Most Impressed with the Destroyer Droids!
","I've seen it three times already and plan to see it again.  I'm glad to see Lucas isn't holding back on the use of technology that is going to make watching a 6-episode marathon like traveling back in time between episode 3 and 4.I love reading the reviews that have knocked the movie's plot and how SLOOOOOOOW it is at times.  I agree that the movie has slow moments, but those are the scenes that build up the intensity of the action scenes!! If all you want is action scenes without plot, go watch Starship Troopers.Jar Jar was a bit annoying.  Loved the cameo appearances by two of my favorite Star Wars creatures.  The sound during the Pod Races was unlike anything I've ever heard!  But the most impressive part of the movie were the Destroyer Droids!!!  I hope to see more of them in episodes 2 and 3!Anyone else thinking that Spielberg will complete the saga since Lucas isn't continuing after episode 6?  Pay close attention to the Senate scenes.",Null,0,0,25 May 1999
