Blade Runner 2049," I want to love this so badly but it was painfully boring
","To start off, this is a genuine review from a longtime fan of the original Blade Runner; Granted the original version (the Final Cut) had its slow moments, but by God, this made that 1982 version seem a lot faster. I will give you the bottomline first: It should NOT have been allowed to go on for 2hours and 45 mins, that killed it. Here are some thoughts after coming out of the cinema: 1. They forgot pacing, excitement and making a movie overall enjoyable. In fact it felt like a bunch of sci-fi hardcores made the movie for themselves without a care whether audiences would love it. And yes it runs almost 3 hours long (imagine the director's cut). I was struggling to stay awake within the first 30 minutes. 2. Yes it is filled with beautiful futuristic scenes and cutting edge special effects, but after the first hour of the same self-indulgent cinematography and no increase in the speed of suspense/excitement you'll be going 'for God's sake can you pick up the pace? Yes we know you love to show us your cyberpunk-whatever landscape, but enough already' 3. This actually happened in the theatre: there were only 5 of us in the cinema. All five fell asleep! It became an impromptu slumber party. There was multiple snoring 4. Ryan Gosling is suitable for this role, because the bulk of the time he just stands or walks around veeeery slowly with a smug-sulk. In fact most of the characters seem to be either brooding for long periods at the camera or walking really slowly to fit the moody music. Must be difficult to walk fast in the future perhaps, gravity? The storyline is mildly decent, i won't reveal anything but it wont blow your mind either. Pity they had such a good thing but they got too self-carried away and let it drone endlessly like the barren landscapes in the movie. And this is coming from a Blade Runner die-hard",5,22,49,6 October 2017
