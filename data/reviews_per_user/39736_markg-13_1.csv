Alien 3," One of the most disappointing sequels of all time
","(Spoilers ahead)
The only film I can think of that I knew I hated before the opening credits even finished.  Aliens was by far my favorite of all the movies in this series and before the opening credits are even done, they kill off all the characters which survived from #2--making Ripley's heroic rescue of Newt totally pointless.  One of the things I liked about Aliens is that they didn't pull the typical horror movie plot about killing everyone but the main character and then they totally ruin it in this one.  If they couldn't get the other actors, okay, but don't kill them off for crying out loud.Other things I hated about this movie: no likeable or memorable characters (strictly monster fodder here), lousy dialog, boring backdrop, a putrid plot with gaping holes and even Ripley is so depressing and lame you are actually glad when she dies.  This is one time you would have loved for them to end with the entire movie just being a bad dream Ripley had while sleeping in the cryogenic chamber.  Then we could have dumped her and made a movie about Hicks and Bishop fighting aliens.I give this movie a rating of 1.  It rates right up there with Highlander 2 in my opinion as one of the worst movie sequels of all time.",Null,738,855,23 April 2000
