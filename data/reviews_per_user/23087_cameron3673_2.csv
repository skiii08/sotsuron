Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Fun to watch but very ridiculous.
","Despite the negative reviews this movie is actually not that bad. It is disappointing that the movie is rated so highly as the target audience would be far better suited at 15 year old boys.There are some negative aspects such as some poor acting and some unusual editing choices such as some badly cut sequences where we have a strange flashback and you only know we are flashing back due to some makeup cues. Another aspect is that you need to know a little bit of Abe's history to make sense of some of the story. Thank goodness for the Simpsons so that non-Americans have some idea of what is going on.The action sequences are entertaining while bordering on the completely ridiculous and occasionally cause a laugh at the completely unbelievable nature of how characters can survive being thrown across a room and smash walls to pieces and still walk away or keep fighting.One major annoying aspect of this film is that Abe can suddenly be this amazing fighting hunter with only ten minutes of training in the woods. A little more training than telling yourself the truth would have been a great addition to the film. This training is one of the negative aspects of the film.This movie is worth seeing and a lot of fun but you need to take into mind that the movie is ridiculous, the action scenes over rely on CG with no practical performances and it has very limited historical accuracy.",7,2,5,5 August 2012
Dark Shadows," Dark Shadows would be better without a globe in the projector!
",Unfortunately for fans of Johnny Depp and Chloe Moretz this would have to be one of the worst pieces that they have made. Hopefully fans will forget quickly. The film had me wishing that I had bought a bigger popcorn. That way after about the first ten minutes I would have something to do. The scenery was excellent and gave the film a great Gothic feel that it needed. The ruins of the mansion looked spectacular. Unfortunately the wooden acting and the manner in which each sub plot was written and resolved like a weekly TV drama made it difficult to have any real reaction when something happened. The comedy aspects that this film is supposed to have must have been playing in the cinema next door. I didn't find any comedy in this film except for the abysmal performance of Eva Green. Yet again another movie where the ending is so obvious and embarrassing when it is finally revealed you sit cringing in your chair hoping that they really don't make the second movie. If you want to see this film wait for it to be on TV so you don't have to pay for it.,1,13,27,12 May 2012
