First Man," Didnt get the Buzz surrounding this film.
",This is a good film but sadly not s great film. The space scenes were visually and audibly stunning. You hear every rivet creak and every panel of the hull groan under the intense pressure. The anxiety of the missions are palpable. However the emotional centre of Armstrong's life at home was rather uningaging. Despite this iys worth watching at the cinema for the space scenes.,6,0,0,25 October 2018
