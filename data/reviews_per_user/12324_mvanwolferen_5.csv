Requiem for a Dream," Just a quiky
","Just want to say that, although some people may find the story gruesome, the pure beauty of each frame of film, each picture as it were, makes this film worth viewing. As I also liked the story and I just always enjoy Christopher 'Rex' McDonald I give it a solid 9 (even when an 8 may be more realistic)",9,0,1,19 October 2002
Requiem for a Dream," Blow My Mind
",Just a short comment as I don't really know why I loved it. It just overloads your senses with impressions and emotions. Flashy camera work makes you high and great acting makes you snif a tear at the end.,9,0,1,3 December 2001
Armageddon," Hate it
","Well, I liked the bit where Paris is in ashes. And as I need 4 lines for approval I will also tell everyone that I really HATED the rest of the picture, ok ok, the special effect where nice, and I'm a big Aerosmith fan but there it ends. The plot is thin, the shot's where all wrong, I just hated it, sorry!",6,0,2,19 October 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," I always get goosebumps.
","While 'the Godfather' is the current number 1, I have to say that, although I love the Godfather, it never gives me the same feeling as 'The Shawshank Redemption'. It gives me goosebumps everytime I see it. You actually pitty the inmates, even when you know what they did. But the best part of the experience is the way the story let's you be Red and look at the terribly strange new inmate and watch him give everyone a better life.",10,0,0,17 October 2002
Am√©lie," Feel Good is not the word, Feel GREAT movie!!!
","As Luc Besson is the only French Director that made it big time, it's very easy to forget what gems lie in the sea that is France. But I can see without a doubt that this movie is one of the most clever written comedies (if you can call it that) I've ever seen. That in combination with the most excellent shots of Paris in the summer and the bright use of colour, makes you fall instantly in love with Amelie and her surroundings. I can only say one thing, I can't wait to get to Paris again.",10,1,3,3 December 2001
