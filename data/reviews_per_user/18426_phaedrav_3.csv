Sucker Punch," Sucker Punch is for Suckers
","Sucker Punch is a pathetic attempt by over the hill producers at a cash grab by throwing every clich√© that hooked them as kids into a random hodgepodge with no pretence of connecting them to make any sense or reason. They even throw in a gratuitous steam punk reference, because they think that's still cool. It could have been another Heavy Metal for the Zoomer generation if they'd bothered to pay for a soundtrack. Instead they throw in covers of tired old hits, like K-Tel records did to squeeze every penny out. They don't even budget a costume change for each number.They get everything wrong, not by trying, just from not even caring. Admittedly this makes it one of the good kind of bad movies. A few of the ideas they steal could have been cute on their own, like flint and steel in a dragon's throat. And the monorail to Jupiter could have been funny except they put regular tracks on what was otherwise an obvious monorail, and the planet didn't work.Clearly set in 1950's New York, no wait 1800s Paris, or is it 1970s Germany? When did flappers use photocopiers and Japanese Gundams to fight dragons to escape polyester suited pimps? Dream sequences aren't sufficient excuse for this. At least there's no way to pick on continuity errors when the whole movie is one big continuity error.It's wrong that it's socially acceptable to go out in public to see a movie based on a comic book when you wouldn't be caught dead reading a comic book on the bus. Only watch this movie at home, secretly, with a riftrax MST3k style running commentary. Better, re-read Tank Girl while watching it again instead.",1,30,65,26 March 2011
Source Code," Groundhog Day Without the Funny
","Source code is not bad enough to be funny, it's just pointless. I'm sure the script looked good to somebody's rich uncle looking for a tax write off. It could have been worth half watching over the Internet except Russell Peters ruins it. It could have been improved with some cowboys on spaceships with lots of slave girls. But Source Code is no The Purge. Visually it's dark and unappealing. Nothing to titillate or arouse here. The music is overly dramatic to no apparent purpose. The blatant product placements are great, but the ads before the movie have more of those, framed better, without the annoying people playing amateur actor in between. Source Code tries hard to trick and mislead you, like Agatha Cristie could. Sadly it fails, and given the rest of the elements, you don't even care that it fails. I really did watch this all the way to the end, just in case it turned into a different movie half way, or the protagonist started claiming 'I see dead people.' There are plenty of Philip K. Dick stories that haven't been remade into movies often enough yet, so no excuse not to have a decent story to work from, even for giving such a shoddy treatment as this. Buy this one from the delete bin, as a present for some relative you don't like. But make sure to get it in some old format you know they can't play.",3,0,6,10 June 2013
Iron Man 2," Not even for masochistic bad film fans.
","Iron Man 2 is the worst waste of digital film I've seen all year. I enjoy bad movies, but nobody should have standards this low. I actually walked out of it. Three times. Atomic Twister wasn't this bad. Don't waste your money seeing it in the theatre. If you must, see it secretly at home, after the Rifftrax is out.This is what happens when property holders know people will see a movie anyway, so they don't need to irresponsibly spend investor money on things like a script, soundtrack, or special effects. You might as well see Escape From New York again instead, it has better special effects and more thought and story in it.That chick who was in all the ads, Scarlett Johansson, isn't even in the movie in any significant way. That was just a PR plot to gauge interest in a potential perpetually put-off ripoff spin off. This movie does not contain boobies, and even the curse words are beeped out, gratuitously. It's like watching a low rent Transformers with all the sexy stuff stripped off.They didn't bother trying to make Moscow look authentic. They did keep Mickey Rourke looking authentic. Mickey Rourke is the only good thing in the film, and he's supposed to be the bad thing! If you're a fan of Mickey Rourke, or any other actors in this film, go see any of their other movies again instead of this one.",2,10,24,7 May 2010
