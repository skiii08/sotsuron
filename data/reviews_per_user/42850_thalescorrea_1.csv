Come and See," The terrible reality exposed
","I basically can not say anything new to add to the praise already said here about 'Come and See'. The movie is very shocking and at the same time very realistic. It's the kind of movie that makes you want to disappear, and never have discovered about this reality. But in the same time makes us realize that we should not be as coward to not want to see what the real world is.The film is shot in a very interesting cinematic techniques. The set up of the cameras helps to tell stories, and acting of the children are astonishing.",8,1,1,2 June 2012
