Hereditary," So awful it has to be on purpose !
","Some movies are bad because the script is bad, or the actors are bad, or the director doesn't know his job.
That's not the case here.
The director must have on purpose decided to bore us to death. I can't see any other explanation.
Some critics mention 'slow burn horror'. Slow burn yes, but horror ? where ? was anything scary in this movie ?
You could delete half the scenes without having any impact on the story, and you could shorten the remaining scenes by two thirds without missing anything.
This was soooooo boring ! I can't understand how a great actress like Toni Collette ended in this mess.",2,1,1,8 May 2020
