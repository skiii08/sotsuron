Walk the Line," At least one Academy Award Performance
","This movie was a very pleasant surprise. Although it got good reviews, it was only the lack of something better when my wife and I decided to catch a matinée before going for dinner that got me into the theater to see it.I was never much of a fan of Johnny Cash, who I often described as having a range of half an octave in an unpleasant key. Furthermore, I just did not believe Joaquin Phoenix was the right man for the role. I believe you had to see Cash to appreciate his unique style. 'The man in black' looked big and powerful on stage as he held his guitar to his shoulder like a rifle, and when lyrics like, 'I killed a man just to watch him die' passed his curled lip while his eyes seemed to dart about the room he could appear somewhat menacing. I didn't think Phoenix could convey that image.I was wrong. In the Folsom Prison scene, when Phoenix yanked the guitar to his shoulder and curled his lip as he poured forth the lyrics, the darting eyes had a look of madness in them. I felt a chill run down my spine  it was as if Cash himself had taken over the actor's body. I actually felt as if I were watching the real Johnny Cash. I have never seen an actor actually become the real-life character he was playing the way Phoenix did. It was an Academy Award performance.Reese Witherspoon handled the June Carter role quite well. She conveyed the spirit quite well, although I don't think anyone ever had the energy and warmth in her comedy that Ms. Carter did. Think Minnie Pearl on speed.Cash is not portrayed as a sympathetic character. He was a self-centered man who could be downright mean. Of course, those characteristics are not exactly rare among big-time entertainers. What makes the story interesting is June Carter's unwillingness to marry him, in spite of her obvious love for him. She made him wait until he knew she could live without him if could not return that love and be faithful to her. Possibly, for the first time in his life he came to value someone else as much as he valued himself. It seemed to work and Cash, along with June Carter Cash, went on to a great career, and reportedly, a good life with the woman he loved.",9,2,4,31 December 2005
The Hunger Games," Missed the book almost entirely
","If one had not read the book(s), I think he might find this to be an enjoyable, if not outstanding, movie. However, anyone who has read the trilogy knows that the movie did not even address the theme that made the trilogy so outstanding. The trilogy is primarily a character study of at least four of the trilogy's characters: Peeta, Gale, Haymitch and most importantly Katniss. Katniss is a girl who seems to stand for honorable ideas, but who finds insult and deceit in almost everything anyone tells her; especially Peeta. She finds comfort in his arms when she is fearful, but then refuses to admit to anyone, including herself, that she has any need for such care. Rather than being the hero, she is more the anti-hero of the story.In the movie, she is brave and bold and smart. In the original she is bold, but not really so brave and certainly not smart. She operates entirely on emotion, saying and doing things without paying the slightest attention to logic. Time and again she is convinced that everything bad that has happened was caused by her. In this view she is only somewhat wrong. But after all of her agonizing and vows of repentance, she continues to do the same self-serving and illogical things that lead to more suffering of herself and others. In book 2, Haymitch tells Katniss, 'See, this is why no one lets you make the plans.' Later, she recalls Haymitch's statement and says,'That's true, no one in their right mind would let me make the plans. Because I can't tell a friend from an enemy.' Here, she is exactly correct, but that does not prevent her from making that mistake time and again with her most loyal friend, Peeta.Nonetheless, Katniss is a very appealing character, and that is what kept me going for three volumes. I got a feeling about Katniss very much like the feeling I had for Scarlett O'Hara in 'Gone With The Wind.'This, not her skill with the bow, is what makes 'The Hunger Games' a great story.",5,2,4,25 April 2012
The Prestige," A great story, but not a great movie
","As I sat in the theater, engrossed in the kind of story I love  complex, intriguing, and mysterious, I wondered why I wasn't enjoying it more. I found myself trying harder to tie the action on the screen to Nikola Tesla's real work than to tie together the many seemingly loose ends of the story.It was a good movie, no doubt, but it seemed a shame not to do more with a story that had so much potential. The problem, I finally realized, was this: there were a number of key events: dramatic, exciting, and violent events that were underplayed to the point of being almost lost in the background. After lingering over a rather dull conversation, the cameras would speed past an amazing and startling event, leaving me to visualize the event in my head long after the camera had gone on to another long conversation. Furthermore, I found it impossible to gain any rapport with any of the main characters other than Cutter, played superbly by Michael Caine, which prevented me from investing myself in any hoped-for outcome. Eventually, the movie just seemed too long. Perhaps, the reason for the rather strange approach, emphasizing words over actions, was that the clues are in the events, not the words, and the filmmakers wanted to promote the film as a suspenseful story full of twists and turns  a movie that would challenge the audience. The problem is that there is nothing really very challenging about the movie. Anyone who follows the events will understand what is going on.Considering the dearth of quality in the Hollywood product, 'The Prestige' is definitely worth going to see, especially for anyone who is interested in the art of illusion. But, a story this good should provide a lot more.",8,2,6,24 October 2006
The Devil Wears Prada," Much better than I had been led to believe
","I had been told that Merryl Streep is great in this movie but the movie isn't really very good, so I went in with very low expectations. Maybe that was good: I really liked 'The Devil Wears Prada' a lot.Maybe I liked it because of two things I had in common with Andy: first, I have had the experience of starting a new job with only the vaguest idea of what I was supposed to do (and how to do it) and finding that everyone expected me to perform competently, without any training or help, right away. Second, I have had a boss (female) who was so difficult to please and so willing to tell her underlings how stupid they were that several quit without even waiting until they could find other jobs. In other words, I could really relate to Andy's situation. Stuff like that actually does happen in the real world. Perhaps, that is the reason that I was possibly the only person in the theater who was hoping Andy would not make the choice she made.One thing that Miranda Priestley (Merryl Streep) had going that my Boss From Hell did not was class. It would have been very easy to create Miranda as a monster, but, wisely and skillfully, Merryl Streep allowed her to have a dignity and intelligence that made her seem to be demanding but not sadistic.Stanley Tucci is superb as Nigel, the ambitious, hard working man who dreams of having a position of power like Miranda's some day.'The Devil Wears Prada' is a very funny movie that is not as far divorced from the real world as, I believe, the producers of this movie may have thought.",9,89,117,5 March 2007
The Aviator," A movie about a man's OCD. Period
","Suppose Martin Scorsese made a biography of Franklin D. Roosevelt which consisted of three hours of discussion of his affair with Lucy Mercer and his Polio induced disability with only slight attention paid to the Great Depression or WWII. Better yet, suppose the movie ended just after FDR's third inauguration with a Republican foe, played by Alec Baldwin, rising and in two or three sentences, acknowledging defeat and predicting that FDR would end the depression and rid Europe of Nazism and Fascism, making it safe for Socialism.Substitute Howard Hughes for FDR and change paralysis to OCD and you have, 'The Aviator.' Scorsese's thesis is that everything Hughes did was the result of an obsession or compulsion. Hughes compulsively chases (and catches) every beautiful Hollywood actress in the 1930's and 40's. Meanwhile, his obsession with airplanes and perfection drives him to design innovative aircraft that enable him to be the first man to circumnavigate the globe in four days and set new air speed records. We are shown a seemingly endless scene (one of many) in which he is trapped in a men's room because he is so obsessed with germs that he is afraid to touch the doorknob. Strangely, this fear of germs doesn't seem to prevent him from touching the private parts of female movie stars. (It should be noted that Hughes's biographers rarely if ever mention his disorder as occurring prior to the late 1950's.) As if in answer to my most fervent prayers, the movie finally concludes in a 1947 scene (after Hughes has defeated the U. S. Senate and several couples have left the theater, but before he has established his business empire) by having Alec Baldwin, as the head of Pan Am, predict Hughes's accomplishments in the 50's and 60's (which should have been shown in scenes replacing those of catch me, catch me with starlets and Hughes suffering from the OCD he had not yet acquired).Cate Blanchett, currently the best actress in Hollywood, is outstanding as Kate Hepburne. Leo DeCaprio is not credible as a giant like Howard Hughes. He isn't helped by having to spend the duration of the movie displaying a facial expression which seems to say, 'I have to find a men's room, fast.' For this atrocity, Scorsese should be exiled to movie hell in Northern Minnesota making movies about female iron workers filing sexual harassment law suits.",1,32,63,15 February 2005
Little Miss Sunshine," Can a million viewers all be wrong?
","Joel Morgenstern, The Wall Street Journal movie reviewer, suggested that 'Little Miss Sunshine' might win the Oscar because it was the only nominee no one disliked. That was the feeling I had going in - it was a movie no one disliked.Well, I am not about to tell you that I'm right and everyone else is wrong: there's an old saying about there being no accounting for taste. But, I will tell you why I didn't like it very much.Actually, I found each of the characters to be quite likable -- at the end of the movie. But, for the first half-hour or so I felt as if I were trapped in a room full of unruly children. I just wanted to get outside and take a deep breath. I guess it's just me, but I don't find humor in people being mean to other people. Nor am I comfortable being present where people seem to be unable to resist describing the flaws in the character of everyone else.Everyone was right about Abigail Breslin - she was charming throughout the movie. Her presence was all that kept me in the theater long enough for the rest of the characters to become civilized.There are some very funny moments in the film. There are some mildly touching scenes, as well. The theme of the movie about what differentiates a winner from a loser is good. Grandpa (Alan Arkin) could have been quoting me when he told Olive why she was not going to be a loser.So, if you like the things I dislike, or if you can avoid becoming irretrievably bummed out long enough to get to like the characters, you may very well like this movie. It seems that almost everyone except me (and the several hundred IMDb reviewers who hated it) liked it a lot.",5,6,11,5 March 2007
The Illusionist," So good I watched it over again.
","Sometimes, when a movie (on DVD) is particularly interesting and thought provoking, I watch parts of it over with director's comments turned on. In the case of 'The Illusionist' my wife and I watched the entire movie over to hear the director's comments. Clearly, as some critics complain, some of the illusions could not be done as shown in the movie (and certainly not in 1900) and the director admits he took some illusions that actually were done during the movie's time period and added to them to provide an enhanced movie effect. But, that is really picking nits in this case because the basic illusions themselves would have been adequate, in the real world, to provoke a similar response. In fact, many illusionists throughout history have done exactly that.Some reviewers compare this movie to 'The Prestige' because they are both about illusions. That is like comparing 'Saving Private Ryan' with 'Apocalypse Now' because they are both about war. In 'The Illusionist' illusions are the means to an end. In 'The Prestige' the illusions are the end. The theme of this movie is that in the minds of most people, there is a fine line between illusion and reality  one need only hear discussions (such as they are) of renewable energy, nuclear power, or global warming to verify the truth in that  and writer/director Neil Burger uses a story of star-crossed lovers (a relationship which, interestingly enough, is not in the original story on which this movie is based) and Eisenheim's (Edward Norton) determination to be with his love, if only in death, as the framework for that theme. At one point in the movie (no spoiler here) the question of whether the visions Eisenheim has produced are illusion or reality is being discussed when Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) states that it doesn't matter  the result is the same. Such, according to Burger, is the nature of the mind. It is often stated - and, incredibly, many people seem to be believe - that perception is reality.Edward Norton is the perfect actor for this role. Norton may have no peer when it comes to using nothing but facial expressions (or lack of same) to convey thoughts and feelings, and that is all-important in this film. It is politically, and legally, necessary that Eisenheim not make claims that could be used against him, so he conveys his thoughts with body (mostly facial) language that is so strong that one feels that words have been said that, in fact, were never spoken. Similarly, he can disclaim, with strong words, any special powers knowing that the people who hear those words will continue to believe the powers exist. I did not think Paul Giamatti was right for the role of the police chief, but he handles it adequately, which is all that is necessary. Similarly, the much-maligned Jessica Biel handles her undemanding role quite well. I was surprised to hear the director say in the commentary that there was some concern about using her in the film since neither Norton nor Giamatti 'suffer fools' very well. He said it in praise, however, because he thought Norton and Giamatti accorded her the respect they would only give to a competent performer. But, this is Norton's movie. He is great in it and makes it a great movie.",10,5,9,13 January 2007
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Like a long lecture by a very boring professor
","Perhaps George Clooney did about as much as he could with a story that really did not have a lot of depth. I suspect that Clooney set out to make an 'All the President's Men' sort of movie featuring Murrow as the crusading journalist. Murrow was a very competent and very popular journalist - one of the first of the TV editorialists - but in the McCarthy case he did not really have to crusade. Like many of today's journalists, he used his show to voice his opinion about a very controversial man who was on a very controversial committee investigating reports of Communists in high government positions. In 1980, this might have been an interesting and informative movie, but much more has been learned since then. We now know that the agents of the Soviet Union McCarthy was searching for did exist, as information from the Venona files has verified. Actually, had Clooney chosen to include the Venona Project he might have made a truly historic movie.The Venona Project was carried out during and after World War II. American military intelligence officers secretly recorded transmissions between Washington and the Kremlin. (You can find information about it on many web sites, including an article entitled 'Significance of Venona' on Wikipedia.) The transcripts were sealed until Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynahan sued under the Freedom of Information Act in the mid-90's to have them released. It would make a great movie. Hollywood has not chosen to tell the Venona story, just as they have not chosen to make movies about the Soviet gulags or China's Cultural Revolution. So, Murrow was no hero, he was doing what Sixty Minutes (or, perhaps, The O'Reilly Factor) does now, although in a manner more suited to the dignified 1950's. McCarthy's popularity faded as a stream of witnesses 'took the fifth' (as they said back then) and the investigation produced very little. McCarthy was indeed very heavy-handed and overly zealous in his approach and his treatment of witnesses (as was Richard Ben Veniste of the 9/11 commission). He was not really responsible for the 'black-listing' of some of the people who were called before the committee, nor was he responsible for the apparent suicide of Don Hollenbeck. It was movie producers and publishers who decided (often as a result of investigations by the House Un-American Activities Committee rather than the Senate's Tydings committee) who they would and would not use, just as they do today, and it was other reporters who attacked Hollenbeck, who chose (as the movie indicated) to involve himself.Ultimately, McCarthy's 'crusade' lost its popularity and he was demonized and driven from his position in disgrace. Anyone who reads the papers or watches the news has seen this happen to numerous senators and congressmen in the past fifteen years or so. It is what is called 'hardball politics.' Even if McCarthy was as bad as he is portrayed, his effect was minor. The Tydings committee (on which McCarthy served) was active for only one month and led nowhere.So, that's the story. It could be told very well in 30 minutes. McCarthy's story has been kept alive by Hollywood and book publishers. Much better movies such as 'The Crucible' (ostensibly telling of the Salem witch trials) have been based on these investigations and, as fiction, have had interesting stories woven into them.People who cannot remember back to that period find it hard to understand our concern with Communism, which is now viewed by many as a benign alternate form of government. I think the people who risked their lives to escape Cuba, East Germany, Stalin's USSR or Mao's China could probably explain it.",1,20,43,25 April 2006
Vanilla Sky," Not Nearly As Good As Open Your Eyes
","I saw Vanilla Sky when it was first released in 2001 and then again on DVD about a month ago. In reading reviews on IMDb I discovered that it was a remake of a Spanish movie, Open You Eyes, and so I ordered it from Netflix as well. Penelope Cruz is the only cast member in both versions. She plays the role of Sofia and does a masterful job. The story is almost exactly the same scene by scene and even in dialogue. But, the ALMOST is significant. When I saw Vanilla Sky, I thought it was pretty good. I did think that it left too much unresolved and an extra scene (which I didn't know was extra at the time), further clouded the resolution with no apparent value to the movie. Ambiguity isn't always bad in a story, but I felt that the resolution in Open Your Eyes was exactly what was appropriate for the movie. I also felt that the scenery-chewing that Tom Cruise did in several scenes of the American version actually detracted from the feel of the story line.There is a bar scene that is almost identical, word for word, in the two films. The only difference is the tone and body language of the main character and the bartender, which makes the Vanilla Sky version quite confrontational while in the Spanish version the scene plays as a simple faux pas on the part of the bartender that is quickly resolved. Again, I thought the confrontation was unnecessary and, I would hope, unrealistic.In general, I think the American version suffers from inferior direction and poorer acting. Penelope Cruz is excellent in both. Cruise and Kurt Russell seem to have decided that their roles needed to big bigger and more emotional. They were wrong.If you are really interested in film making, I suggest you watch both and see how seemingly small changes can change the 'feel' of a movie. Otherwise, I recommend Open Your Eyes.",7,0,0,7 August 2009
Atonement," I will tell you exactly why this movie is painfully bad...
","I will not say that this is a really bad movie because a lot of people think it is really good and, unlike some others, I am not arrogant enough to think that my taste should set the standard for everyone else. There is no accounting for taste, even bad taste.However, I thought it was a painfully bad movie and I will tell you very specifically why.First, some specific things that prevented a knowledgeable viewer from sympathizing with the characters.1. In the promo they say that a young girl sees something she doesn't understand and mistakenly tells a story that that has tragic consequences. That entire sentence isn't a quote, but 'something she doesn't understand' is. In fact, she sees several things and she does understand enough to know what is going on. The specific event that tops off the sequence of events that ruin lives is one she knowingly lies about whether or not she fully understands it, and she clearly has set out to destroy a man's life (apparently motivated by jealousy). Even before the 'main event,' she says that he should be put away where he can hurt no one. 2. It is said in one of the promo trailers (no spoiler here) that Robbie had the choice between prison and going to war. Well, this was a part of WWII that most Americans don't know about because America hadn't entered it at that time, but all able-bodied men in the UK went to war. 3. The scene in the library was absurd. To disrespect one's family by doing something like that in a library with a horde of people wandering around would have been the height of disrespect and stupidity. 4. In the 1930's in Britain (or America for that matter), if a father caught his daughter engaged in (or learned of) the acts that actually did occur the boy would find going to prison to be one of the nicer things that might happen to him.Now, about the structure of the movie:The story has a beginning and an end. Most of the story should have taken place in a middle that does not exist in the movie. There are events with major consequences for all involved: the girl (Briony), Cecelia, Robbie, the Tallis, Quincy, and Turner families, as well as others. These events take place in the beginning of the story: And the consequences? We learn nothing of what happened except a little of Briony, that Robbie chose war, and that Cecelia stayed around, possibly waiting for Robbie  or possibly not, as we learn near the end of the film. The middle of the story is related in a few sentences.The end of the film is supposed to show the 'atonement'. Presumably, this is Briony's atonement for ruining a few lives  we don't know how many because that would have occurred in the middle of the story. Atonement is 'satisfaction given for wrongdoing.' Unless one includes satisfaction obtained by the wrongdoer, which I don't think counts, there is no atonement.So, what does one have? Some very unlikable characters, some of whom have bad things happen to them because of bad things done by other unlikable characters. The few likable characters disappear during the non-existent middle of the story.If you choose to see this movie you may very well find something to like, but I don't think it will be anything that is a part of the story.",1,87,161,25 April 2008
