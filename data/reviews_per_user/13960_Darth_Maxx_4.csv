Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I good start to build on
","I have been a Star Wars fan since birth and I was always interested in seeing a new installment. When I heard about George Lucas started plans for Episode 1 back in 1995, I was exited about it. In 1998 i've seen the trailers and red articles and i really wasn't expecting the greatest movie ever, but i was expecting unique eye candy, great action scenes, cool characters and also a little more depth into the Jedi mythology.I didnt see it in theaters but i did here the negative reviews, And when I first saw it I totally accept the film. It was on that same level with Matrix but the depth of Episode 1 was what hindered it. My biggest problems were with the little developement of Characters and the many childish humour. The childish humour just didn't  fit in with a movie about Trade Federations and Republics and all this heavy story. Obi-Wan and Darth Maul were the coolest characters but very under used. Most of the time Obi-Wan is just standing around in the background and Darth Maul had just 2 lines before his FINAL CUT (sorry, bad pun).The movie had many of the feelings that made Episode 4 great but the feeling is sadly brief. But really is there any way that Lucas could have prevented this film from being scrutinized with all that hype created by many fans and the Media. I doubt anybody could. Under the circumstances, Phantom Menace was done very prefessionally and creatively. The only thing missing was the wit, which had most of it's impact on Empire.One other dissapointment was that the story was a bit confused. It wasn't clear bout where it was going or which audience it was for. However that happens to many movies. Compared to the usual Brainless Summer flicks, The Phantom Menace was a visual classic. I loved the epic landscape, the pod race, the Jedi/sith 3 way battle, the droid vs. Gungan battle (The first part any way) and the dogfight with the droids. Phantom Menace had some really good ideas but many of them didn't come of as well. Jar Jar for example. A CGI character as part of a live action cast is really cool idea but Jar Jar is just to silly for adults or kids to take seriously.But hey I still loved this film for what it is, the only other blockbusters i'd put over it is Matrix, Star wars Episode 4 and 5, Crouching Tiger and Gladiator. And Episode 2 should do better since the fans are now doubting George Lucas' ability to surpass the first trilogy. I'm going to see it regardless because Star Wars is the type of movies i like to see. and not many movies these days have that Unique original edge.",6,0,1,18 May 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," One of the greatest movies this millenium
","Spoiler warningI do agree that Episode 1 was a disappointment but in my Honest opinion, I think Episode ii was a overall success. George Lucas' directing abilities had definatly made a significant improvement over the first. Although Lucas doesn't capture the same magic as A New Hope (and he or anyone else never will, so get over it) he did creat a film just as entertaining and imaginative as his original epic. I really fell in love with the story so much that dialogue and acting flaws in some scenes were minor.What worked in the film: Villains- Dooku, Zam Wessel, Jango, Boba, They were all great. especially Dooku. Jango is just as cool as Maul. Eventhough both villiains had early finishes, Jango was atleast mourned. Action scenes- The Corucant chase to the Asteroid Dogfight to the Arena Battle, all were top notch. Acting- The first 30 minutes had lacked emotion, by the end of the movie I felt sorry for the characters, even Jar Jar. The Adult Mood- I dont mind the light moments but the dark feeling helps. The Politics- didn't bother me in Ep I. Don't bother me here. The Pace- Not as slow as Ep I. The slow parts were actually entertaining. The Love Story- What in f***ing hell is so appalling about it. Compared to Han and Leia, This love story is just as good. It's epic like even. The Fights- OOOOOOOOOOOOh! Revealing Wardrobe of Padme- AAAAAAAAAAAAh! Comedic Relief- Each character had their funny momments but it's good to see R2 and 3p0 are back in that department. Jar Jar toned down- He acually seems less than a cartoon and more as an actual character. I hated when he was manipulated by Palpatine though.What didn't work- Many cool scenes were cut and Some scenes seemed rush. Also a few compositing shots didn't work as well. As for the acting, I don't Care!! I wasn't good nor awful. Most of the time it felt beleivable.Bottom line, I loved the movie despite the critizism. Even more than Spider-ManAttack Of The Clones (9.5/10) A New Hope (9/10) Empire Strikes Back (9/10) Return Of The Jedi (8.5/10) The Phantom Menace (7/10)",7,0,0,17 May 2002
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Decent Enough
","The first time I saw this movie I had a blast in theaters. But honestly the script did had flaws that are just unexplainable. How did the crew on the T-rex transport ship get mutilated? why are Tim and Lex there for only 10 seconds? Why did Vince Vaughn's character take the bullets from the Tembo's shotgun, even though he was a hunter, he was in a situation where he needed them? Is it possible for a little girl who knows gymnastics can 'kick' a RAPTOR out a window?(It did look cool though when i saw it the first time.)And why can't the death scenes be more unpredictable.Spielberg and Co. did do a goood job making this one a darker and more gritty than the first, And most of the cast did their characters well, but the script just did not do the film justice. The Special FX did top the first and the action scenes were great. The T-rex in San Diego was an idea that i always wanted to see, so im not completely dissatisfied. It would never replace the first and mabye people was hoping for that.And John Williams is the best. I heard he wont be on 4 JP3. Now thats a dissapointment already. JP3 might suck or they might supprise us with something new (I hope) Imma watch it anyway.",Null,0,1,21 April 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," Stylish, Inventive but Dry and Emotionless (Minor SPOILERS)
","The most anticipated sequel of the new millienium has been released, and 2003 is deemed the 'Year of the Matrix'. I saw it today and I was puzzled, but not about the plot, it was if I liked it or not. It is significantly weaker than the first, FOR SURE. Matrix 1 was a grand, exciting and smart movie that was well put together. I just cannot say that about the second.
Reloaded did have brilliant and funny momments, however bogged down with uneccesary and worthless fighting, cgi and crashes. The Supporting characters are cool as hell (Niobi, Persephone, That guy who likes french, etc.) even if many of them had one emotion right throughout the film. Trinity was the heart and soul of the film. Morpheus is strong here as well. A dissapointing detail was that Neo was flat, not that it's Keanu's fault.
Dramatic things happen to NEO but there is no drama there to feel. Also, if Neo could do god-like things in the matrix, WHY DIDN'T HE? And that's besides flying (which he can't do without forcing himself). I mean really! What god-like man, fights kung-fu when he can just push adversaries away like bullets.Speaking of kung-fu, the fights have improved but aren't as memorable as the first. In Matrix 1 the fights had purpose. The fights, in Reloaded, seem out of place.The most disturbing detail of the movie has to be the CG. A fully CG Neo seems pointless, looks stupid and adds NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!! Even the Twins weren't that special. The CGI in this movie couldn't even hold up to Harry Potter at its best!Months ago, the special FX advisor, of the Matrix, made a statement about the people behind the Star Wars prequels are so focused with the technology than the plot suffers. What does he think happened here? And CG characters mimicing real people CAN be easily spotted, especially during (gasp) slow motion, uh oh!The Wachowski bros. do have great, inventive, intelligent ideas though, I can't say otherwise. However, the public would probably get a better blockbuster movie experience elsewhere, considering that the Hulk promises REAL EMOTION WITH IT'S SPECIAL EFFECTS. And If Revolutions don't Revolve, then mabye T3 would be the 'Man-against-machine' movie we've been waiting for.
Reloaded may turn out to be the weakest in the series (that is if the third one kicks). If I was asked if Reloaded was better than X2, I'd wouldn't even anwser. A well executed film, but the flaws are too huge to ignore, I wasn't even this picky about The Phantom Menace.5.5/10",5,0,0,17 May 2003
