Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat --- Destined to have a short shelf life
","Look --I like to Christian bash just as much as the next fellow. And as far as mocking pretentious southern Republicans -- the kind who inhabit Seccession Drive in the movie .....well I am usually as game as I can be. Same goes with showing up drunken frat boys. I have built up a great deal of eager animosity against all of these groups. But watching Borat skewer these same people somehow caused me a bit of discomfort. Sure, it was an uneasiness punctuated by laughter --- but still the whole process left me a little queasy. It has been said that this movie is holding a mirror up to America --but I think that the makers of the movie (Cohen, Charles et al) really say a lot more about themselves than about the U.S. ---- The same goes for those who have posted review after review on IMDb (and other places) that herald this as as the 'funniest movie ever made.' There are a lot of laughs to be found here --- but they are easy laughs - the moral equivalent of shooting fish in a barrel. Where does the comedy stop and the ugliness begin?The inspired comedic moments in this film are there but they are few and far between. Borat addressing the crowd before the Rodeo and then mangling the National Anthem. The highlight of this sequence is a cowgirl bearing the stars and stripes taking a tumble - a fortuitous accident that greatly benefited the filmmakers. Then we have the infamous nude wrestling sequence involving Borat and his morbidly obese producer (Azamat). It's funny the first time you see it--but I would bet heavy money that subsequent viewings are rather less hilarious.The upshot of all of this is that the stars danced just right in the sky for Borat to be the huge success that it has been -- but don't tell me that there is anything truly groundbreaking here -- and certainly not anything socially relevant. Borat is just not in that class. And the mass of humanoids will probably figure that out sooner rather than later. I have to believe that the number of people who buy the DVD for Borat and whip it out once a year (like I do with Dr. Strangelove) to get a few laughs -will, in the end be, quite disappointed. It's going be like eating a stale sandwich. In that respect, Borat is easily the 'Titanic' of the comedy genre.",6,8,17,14 November 2006
Gettysburg," 'Well sah.......they wouldn't leave!'
","'Gettysburg' was first conceived as a miniseries. The original intent is easily discerned in the sometimes choppy flow of the story. At 4 hours the movie is long and the script is rendered anemic at times. Still, it is a decent effort to put real American history on the screen. The first segment concerns Buford's brave stand on the first day of the battle. Sam Elliot is good as the Union cavalry commander who risked his unit to buy a few hours for the Army of the Potomac to come up and occupy the high ground outside of Gettysburg. It was a gamble that paid off. The second part of the film centers on J.L. Chamberlain's 20th Maine throwing back the Confederates who were trying to turn the Union flank at Little Round Top on the second day. This action received much acclaim more than 125 years after the fact when it was featured in Ken Burn's Civil War (1990). In that series it was described as a feat that 'saved the Union army........ and maybe even the Union itself.'. Jeff Daniels bears a striking resemblance to Chamberlain and does a fine job with the role. Unfortunately, the script gives him some lame lines at times. ('Here they come again boys!'). He is especially badly used by keeping his character around after the moment of glory to just duck Confederate shells in the back of the Union center during Pickett's Charge on the third day. Chamberlain's brother is dizzily played by C. Thomas Howell. His is the only character in the film that really got on my nerves---I kept hoping that he would collapse from heat stroke or get hit in the head and knocked unconscious by a spent minnie ball. The scene where Howells' character talks to the rebel prisoners, at the end of the first day of the battle, is supposedly based on a famous Civil War painting. But John Huston must have had the exact same idea when he made 'The Red Badge of Courage ' (1951) --- The scene in 'Gettysburg' almost exactly matches the one in 'Red Badge of Courage' even down to some of the dialogue. Only John Huston had the good fortune of having his lines uttered by Arthur Hunnicutt and not C. Thomas Howell.Another part of the picture follows the course of all three days of the battle as seen from the perspective of the Confederate commanders. Tom Berenger is very charismatic as Longstreet. However, like Daniels, he has got to spout some rather insipid lines at times. And he has to stand there like a dummy while his junior officers engage in a flip discussion on the pros and cons of Darwinism. Berenger's southern accent is overdone at times and on a couple occasions it seems to disappear altogether. Still - all in all - a creditable performance. Longstreet spends a great deal of the movie trying to convince General Lee (Martin Sheen) to disengage the rebel army and find a strong defensive position somewhere between the Union army and Washington. It's ironic then that he is left to plan and execute (against his own strong judgment) the futile Confederate assault on the Union center on the last day of the battle.I see in the trivia section of IMDb that Sheen was only the 4th or 5th choice to play Robert E. Lee. Sheen does not match Lee's physical type. Lee being relatively tall and angular while Sheen is a smaller man. I think Sheen would make a wonderful General Grant - he bears a remarkable likeness to the Union General. However--taking all of that into account -it is a tribute to Sheen's acting ability that he does succeed to a large degree in this role. He shows Lee's fighting spirit, his dignity and humility. The scene where Lee rides among his cheering troops just before Pickett's charge is the most moving of the film---and apparently completely unplanned. More is revealed in the faces of the re-enactors in this scene- about the caliber of the men of the Army of Northern Virginia -than could be discovered in any other ten Civil War movies.The conventional view is that Pickett's Charge was a horrendous blunder by Lee -- his only major mis-step of the war. I tend to hold with those who dissent from this view. Lee certainly knew that the final assault was a long shot. However, he also knew that it was imperative that a decisive defeat be inflicted on the Union Army somewhere north of Washington. He was determined to seize the day and the hour to attack the Union Army wherever he could and not let the campaign be deflected by stalemate or the uncertainty of further maneuvering. The battle of Gettysburg had a now or never quality for Lee. He rolled the dice and lost.Stephen Lang is unmatched in theatrical flair as Pickett. If you want to see real life courage though- you had better watch Richard Jordan's performance as Armistead. A dying man in real life playing a man fated to die in the movie. The friendship motif that is played out between Jordan's Armistead and Brian Mallon's Union General Hancock doesn't work. The emotional connection is not made---but it is not from a lack of emotional sincerity or intensity on Jordan's part. While this movie only succeeds modestly where it does succeed - it can at least be said that- where it fails--it doesn't miss by much. I have a real appreciation for the effort that I can see was made here to put American history on the screen. The commitment is made visible by the acting performances, in the use of re-enactors -- in the camera work on location at the Gettysburg battlefield--in the beautiful musical score. This is a movie worth owning.",7,3,6,9 February 2005
Lost in Translation," Much better the second time........................................................
","I would have to agree with others on this site that 'Lost In Translation' is often better appreciated on a second viewing. I wasn't much impressed with the movie the first time I saw it. Initially, the'Charlotte' character seemed to be much too self-interested. She came across (as acted by Scarlett Johansson) as nothing much more than an awkward if precocious child. I also thought that the relationship between Charlotte and the Bill Murray character (Bob Harris) was a little too cute and contrived. The Tokyo presented in the movie seemed a weary and confusing way-station on a journey to nowhere. My attention continually flagged on the first viewing.When I viewed L.I.T.again (six months later) I came away with a much better opinion. The movie is very effective- after all -in telling the story of an unlikely friendship between two people drawn together completely by chance but both engaged in a common struggle to come to terms with their lives. Coppola has to be given credit for the clarity and thoroughness of how the story is told. There are few if any purely incidental scenes that I can find--every step is set out with a purpose (often with a dual purpose). As an example -the scene with Bob Harris and the Japanese 'premium fantasy girl' is,at first glance, done just for laughs --and it is funny. However, coming as early in the movie as it does, it was designed to show that the Bill Murray character is not a pig (not all of the time at least). When offered a prostitute --he sends her back. This idea is reinforced later as Bob and Charlotte form a bond which doesn't quite reach the level of sex. The movie does have a clear 'women's sensibility' in that respect.The idea of intimacy without sex intruding is not something that many male directors have explored. It isn't till late in the film that we see that Murray's character is indeed interested in sex.... He does sleep with the hotel lounge singer for the express purpose of showing the audience that he does have the impulse.The relationship between Bob and Charlotte is cloudy in some respects. It remains platonic however there are hints of the 'sex thing' lurking out there. Curiously enough Coppola goes to the trouble of offering some 'cover' for Bob and Charlotte to have sex by letting us glimpse their marital frustrations. This is especially true in the case of Charlotte as we are shown her husband's mild infatuation with a Hollywood bimbo. In the case of Bob we are allowed to glimpse the cold nature of his marriage by comments his wife makes (or doesn't make) as they talk over the phone. But --in the end--this 'cover' is only used to justify the intimacy of Bob and Charlotte's friendship.The Tokyo of the movie, for me anyway, comes to represent life. Life is sometimes like being a foreigner in Tokyo --with all its excitement(and dreary boredom), confusion--the feeling of being lost and adrift - and the seeking.One aspect of the movie that I have not seen discussed in the IMDb reviews is the effect of Bob's celebrity on Charlotte. He is described as being 'washed up' -however everything is relative. He is still making $2 million dollars for a couple of Tokyo photo shoots --he is still an easily recognizable celebrity. One wonders if Charlotte would have approached and sought a relationship with Bob if he was just a 53 year old businessman visiting Tokyo. In 'real life' Bob's celebrity would have been the crux of the relationship--but In the movie it seems almost incidental to the story. It is interesting to speculate as to what the movie would have been like if they had chosen to dispense with Bob's celebrity status.I usually don't like 'women's movies'--romances etc.......I think everyone can agree that the saving grace of the film is that the two main characters don't sleep together---It gives the movie a sweet tilt....... O.K.-I must be getting soft or having a mid-life crisis. It does however give me a warm and fuzzy feeling to think that there must be some girl out there--fresh out of college -who might adore me for all of my sensitivity and vulnerability--..well...I hope my wife doesn't read this review.",8,1,2,25 January 2005
It's a Wonderful Life," A Walk On The Wild Side With Frank Capra
","A glance at the calendar tells me that we are now safely into February - Christmas and New Years have retreated back to wherever it is that they go to.... and the large balance of the year lies before us until they will intrude again. The smell of holiday ham and homemade pumpkin pie has been extinguished like a used up candle and the strains of Yule melodies have fled the air. Just the perfect time to take a look at 'It's A Wonderful Life' from a different perspective and at an angle which is free from the traditional Christmas messages of redemption and human charity that the movie is usually seen to offer. What I am talking about here is...lechery.....lechery and lasciviousness pure and simple. I am referring to sexual degradation not only in the speculative chimera of Pottersville but also in that great American expository small-town oasis of Bedford Falls. If Frank Capra bothered to read the reviews of 'It's A Wonderful Life' at the time the picture was first released at Christmastime in 1946--there is little doubt in my mind that he would have been at least slightly disturbed by the assessments made that his new movie was nothing more than just a slight variation from his past efforts. His penchant for fashioning heartwarming films that championed the individualism and strong character of the 'little man' against the vagaries and injustice of the 'system' had, after all, given rise to the pejorative term 'Capra-corn'. By 1946, however, it appears that Capra was working hard, if not to change his modus operandi, then to at least 'spice it up a bit'. That is part of the reason he gave us a view into the 'dark side' of American society by highlighting the filth and sordidness of Pottersville. What few people remark on, however, is that dribs and drabbles of the parallel universe represented by the cesspool of Pottersville can be whiffed every now and then in Bedford Falls itself. You don't believe me? Well let me give you an example.Do you remember the scene in the movie where George Bailey is standing on a street corner shooting the breeze with his pals, Ernie the cab driver and Bert the cop? Yes --another nice sunny day in Bedford Falls. Then Violet Bick strolls by. She is accosted by George who has the impertinence to remark: 'Say Vi that is some dress you got on there.' Violet puts her hand on hip and protests: 'This old thing--I only wear this when I don't care what I look like.' She then shimmies across the street.... the camera following her receding wiggle for almost a good half block. Capra provides some cover for this ogling by having a middle aged bank clerk type pass by and then crank his head around to closely inspect her saunter. He, in turn, is almost flattened by an automobile that is crossing the intersection in the other direction (the sex as death ethos). But this exercise in venality is not finished. The camera then switches back to George and the boys still staring at Violet....... who at this point must be nearing the edge of the horizon. Ernie pipes up: 'How would you like to.....?' George cuts him off by blurting, 'Yes!' The trance is broken and Bert stumbles away commenting that he has to go home and see what his wife is doing. Sly and sick Ernie then sarcastically cracks 'family man'. This is a scene fraught with sexual tension, voyeurism with masochistic tendencies and it is occurring in real time in broad daylight on a street corner in Bedford Falls. O.K.--want another example? One without that sexpot Violet Bick---who some reviewers have painted as the 'Mary Magdalene' to George Bailey's suffering 'Jesus'. Well how about that virgins of virgins--little eighteen year old Mary Hatch? Everyone has witnessed the famous high school dance/pool scene where George and Mary end up soaking wet. The next scene shows them walking home in the dark--George is wearing an over-sized football uniform in lieu of his wet duds and Mary sports nothing more than a robe. This sweet couple gets right down to business by breaking out the windows in a neighborhood house. Then George tries to put a move on Mary at the instigation of a peeping-tom yelling from a nearby porch. Mary jumps out of her robe in the ensuing mêlée and is left shaking and naked in a nearby hydrangea bush. The use of the hydrangea represents, of course, only the most demented form of erotic symbolism. I always send my kids out of the room in anticipation of this scene.I could go on and give more examples --but I think you get the point. Even 'old Annie' the house-maid is not immune from this carnival of lust and immorality.Please don't misunderstand me- here. I am not condemning the whole picture. I do indeed accept that 'It's A Wonderful Life' is the 'American Christmas Carol'. It echoes the central idea of the Dicken's tale that we are all responsible for each other and it also adds to that idea the very American conception that 'no man is a failure who has friends.' Wonderful stuff really. But be aware when admiring the glitter of this holiday gold that it also contains the base alloy of sex and sin. Or put another way--it's o.k. to enjoy the rustic pleasures of walking across a beautiful, green farm pasture ----- just be careful to hold your nose and watch your step along the way.",8,4,13,8 February 2005
Paths of Glory," Holds up well enough
","I don't mean to beat up on BusterLA regarding the previous critical post ( Not what it used to be)--but I have to disagree with the assertion that 'Paths Of Glory' is a dated and too simplistic film. The whole question about how movies hold up over time seems to always be a ripe subject for discussion (and I think misunderstandings). 'Paths Of Glory' was released in 1957 and I suppose was slightly ahead of its time--Of course within the next 15 years movies like Catch-22 and M*A*S*H would bring their own anti-war messages -'Paths of Glory' was banned in France until 1975--otherwise I don't think it upset or offended many others at the time. It's a bit more candid than 'All Quiet on the Wesern Front' --however that movie was released back in 1930 (do the math). 'Paths Of Glory' holds up well not because the theme or particulars are that new or outrageous---but only because it is so well and clearly told (thank you Mr. Kubrick). Please don't confuse clarity for a failure of imagination or creativity.It's a given in this movie that the officers (except for Dax) represent the dark and cynical side -however- they are not morally bankrupt without explanation--they have a logical agenda of tradition and self interest based on the real (and sometimes mistaken) necessities of war. That everything accrues to their personal ambitions is nothing less than a reflection of 'the way it was'.The condemned soldiers are also not just cardboard cutouts given victim status. One soldier is a 'social misfit'---one other assaults a priest the night before the execution and another one struggles to maintain his courage and falters more than once.I am not a big Kirk Douglas fan--however I think he does a fine job here--perhaps a little bit too forcefully heroic--however you will note that there is no attempt to separate him out -- He is- in the end-- just another cog in the machinery of the war---His defiance to the system has real limits.Finally, I guess I will have to defend the final scene of the movie where French soldiers choose not to humiliate a young German woman. I note that some critics think this scene is jarringly out of place or pointless--however I think it is very effective and speaks well to the subject at hand. Look into the soldiers eyes in that last scene --you can see then that they see themselves in that young girl -they understand her situation only too well. The last scene is put there I think to show that humanity is not automatically and by default cruel and ruthless and corrupt all of the time. The soldiers in the final scene choose to exercise mercy-when given the chance -even against the backdrop of a time and place where the execution of three innocent men is really only incidental trivia in the face of hundreds of others dying in the trenches daily.",8,0,0,11 January 2005
