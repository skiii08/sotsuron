It," Too much jokes, but i'll give an 7.
","In my opinion It (2017) was a pretty nice movie, counting on that the movie promised a really scary movie that would be disturbing. Well, that doesn't happen, actually. It turned out to be more a funny than a scary movie to be honest but this doesn't let out the scenes that may cause you some discomfort, like the scene where Henry kills his father,the scene where Patrick Hockstetter watches the dead kids in the sewer or even the scene where Henry carves his name with a knife on Ben's stomach. Either Scary or Funny movies can be good and entertaining and putting together both of these movies styles you form IT (2017), even tough it's a good movie and will make you laugh, will make you scared and sometimes discomfortable as I said in the beggining, but believe me, It (2017) is worth watching.",7,0,0,11 August 2019
Toy Story 4," Unnecessary,didn't like the ending, but a good story.
","Toy Story's brand ends here (probably), I expected another ending, but telling the truth it was awful. To be honest, if Pixar wants to ruin our childhood, do something else, but not Toy Story. Complete useless ending for the movie, but the story of it saves everything.",8,0,4,26 August 2019
It Chapter Two," Not good compared to the first.
","Jesus, this was a total mess! The same problem they're doing is too much marketing. Ugh this was a total dissapointment for me, the first one was much better, this one has too many cheap jumpscares and it's too long!! The only thing that saved was the book scenes, like the chinese bar scene and Mrs. Kersh's scene too.",6,1,2,7 September 2019
