Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Overrated and Over-hyped
","I'll be brief. I saw this movie 2 days ago with expectations of a hilarious and satisfying movie. It was hilarious, but totally disappointing...and the humor was all crude and stupid humor. It was so outrageous at some scenes that I simply wanted to leave and get out. Long story short, this movie fell way short of my expectations and I believe this movie has been over-hyped before its release to make moviegoers anticipate this garbage. Everything hilarious you want to see can be seen on www.youtube.com. After seeing how movie critics praised this movie, I have begun losing trust in their judgment and opinion. Borat...you suck.",1,263,528,11 November 2006
Forrest Gump," a great film
","I just REALLY saw this film for the 1st time in my US History Class (technically my 2nd time, I saw it when it first came out in 1994 and had no clue what it was about) and I must say it is the greatest movie I've ever seen. Once the viewer has a full understanding of the historical context of the movie, he/she can appreciate the ingenious plot of this story, told through the eyes of a simplistic yet at the same time complex individual. His relationship with Jenny as they part ways and are then re-united is a love story that is emotionally touching and moving. Everything about this movie deserves praise. It's a shame IMDb only allows for 10/10 ratings.",10,1,4,13 May 2006
American History X," An excellent film
","I took the liberty of watching this movie out of boredom and curiosity last week. Although I had heard about it, I knew little more than the premise of the movie and expected a clich√©d story of reform and self-discovery. This movie is...incredible. The acting is superb, with Edward Norton's performance as the despicable, yet highly intelligent and convincing Derek Vinyard who ultimately undergoes a transformation that is so realistically and emotionally portrayed. Other cast members such as Edward Furlong gave great performances as well. This is one of those movies that really gets inside of your skin and stirs you up with emotion, as you are presented with two sides of the battle between racism and acceptance in all its gory detail, with heated debate and physical violence that captures the spirit of this film. Not much more I can say but to recommend it to all viewers mature enough to handle it (the R rating was given for a very good reason).",10,0,2,14 May 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," A good culmination of the X-Men Trilogy
","I saw this movie on opening day with a friend of mine, and I thought for such a short movie (1hr 30min) it managed to keep me and the rest of the moviegoers interested and despite minimized roles for certain usual cast members it went smoothly. The action is fast-paced and visually stunning. Brett Ratner did a good job considering he took the helm in the middle of production, and there were no obvious inconsistencies with Bryan Singer's X-Men and X2. And that little YouTube snippet near the end of the film had me rolling with laughter. Not to mention the suspenseful cliffhanger at the end.Overall, great action thriller.My only complaint: 'Where's Gambit?!'",9,0,1,29 May 2006
The Dark Knight," Amazing on so many levels
","Considering all the hype leading up to this movie's release, such as WB's marketing campaign and the publicity surrounding Heath Ledger's death, it was possible that we could all be underwhelmed come release day with a movie like Spiderman 3 that was maybe good on its own but worse than its predecessors. Well, The Dark Knight did not disappoint. Not only is it better than its predecessor, Batman Begins, it is better than any comic-based movie ever made. I have yet to see all of them but I am still confident they are not as good as this movie. I would even go as far as to say this is one of the best movies ever made, as the ratings on IMDb will speak for themselves. Christopher Nolan strikes the perfect balance between preserving the authenticity of the Batman mythos with his own realistic, dark approach to the series. His characters are believable and well developed. The Joker is truly the highlight of the film, as Heath Ledger creates a character that is less comical and 'funny' than his previous incarnations as he is sinister; he is the pure essence of evil and his desire to witness chaos and suffering drives the riveting plot. Harvey Dent, Gotham's City DA is another character whom I thought was well portrayed by Aaron Eckhart, and his battle with Joker for Gotham's sake is a beautiful tragedy that not only takes a toll on the city but his life as well. And of course you have Christian Bale's Batman, who is as good as ever. He's dark, mysterious, vigilant, but he's also Bruce Wayne, and his human side is tested to the fullest when the Joker wreaks havoc upon Gotham City. As if the mature and dark nature of the film weren't enough, Nolan has outdone himself with the creation of action scenes that are well-choreographed and stunning. Batman Begins, being an origin story, was a bit slow and heavy on the dialogue but The Dark Knight lets viewers see Batman in full-fledged action in his quest to save Gotham City. This movie is long (about 2 1/2 hours) but there is no filler; it cuts to the chase. It is a well-crafted, gripping, suspenseful movie that will leave some sort of impression on you, but a good one I promise. It's only been out for a few days but I'm already waiting for a sequel that will kick as much, if not more. The Dark Knight is an excellent movie, bar none and if you haven't already, do yourself a favor and watch it.",10,1,3,20 July 2008
Grindhouse," Over-hyped and Overrated
","I think I used this same title for a review I wrote for Borat last year. I am not a big fan of Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez is okay, but their efforts combined came out to be, in my opinion, a disaster. Planet Terror had its moments but it was really just gross and had little 'value.' The trailers in between were just...stupid. And Deathproof was even worse; it just makes you go WTF? the whole time and follows around a dull plot that is made even duller with all the excessive and useless dialogue which almost makes you forget what you're watching and ultimately deters from the experience. With that said, I would not recommend this film(s) unless you have a fetish for gore, mindless violence, and long, windy dialogue that gets you nowhere.",3,21,59,8 April 2007
300," Best Greco/Roman Film since Gladiator
","Not since Russell Crowe delivered a knockout performance in 2000 as Maximus in Gladiator has a movie that takes us back thousands of years in history been so fascinating. This movie has stunning visuals; it almost seems surreal with the shading/lighting and special effects but regardless it looks great. Gerard Butler has catapulted himself into the higher echelon of Hollywood actors with his great and forceful portrayal of King Leonidas. Although it was a great movie with some epic battle scenes that keep you tuned in all the way, I thought it was a bit slow going at points but other than that it was awesome and should not be overlooked. (which would be nearly impossible with all the hype it has been getting for a good reason)",9,0,6,10 March 2007
