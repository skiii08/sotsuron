Lucky Number Slevin," flawed thriller
","An article with director Paul McGuigan on the casting of the movie told me the stars were won over by the script. That's hard to see.It's a game of two halves; the set-up and the execution of a complex plan, with each half bringing it's own problems.The opening hour concerns Slevins mistaken identity and his subsequent meetings with the two rival crime bosses. Slevin's 'witty' nonchalence during these meetings lends an air of predictability to the film's 2nd half. The final 40 minutes of which become an agonisingly patronising walk through of events.Yet for it's faults, the movie has it's charm. The script ties up well, and Lucy Lui gives a surprisingly great performance as the love interest. She is a shining light above some awfully mediocre turns from the other stars (I can never buy Morgan Freeman as a bad guy).In the end though i think it is Paul McGuigan's direction, which at times shows real class, that raises lucky number slevin over other movies in this genre.",6,0,1,14 July 2007
The Village," too many holes
",1. ERRR why exactly didn't one of the elders just go and get the medicine thus not risking the secret of the village? What a ridiculous oversight.2. why didn't the guy whos son died at the beginning just take him to a doctor outside would he really risk his sons life for an 'Oath'.3. How is the village so populated exactly? yet only 12 elders know the secret..........dubious.I dunno about anyone else but one of the reasons i didn't forsee the ending was because it was so lame id Just totally lost interest after i found out the creatures weren't real.plus The brotherhood of the wolf did a better job of tackling the paranoia of beasts in the woods,Null,0,0,1 September 2004
