First Man," Outstanding!
","A nice fit among 'The Right Stuff', 'Apollo 13', & 'From The Earth To The Moon'. It doesn't attempt to compete, but rather augments them on a more personal experience level. You feel the sense of loss, risks, and even dread involved in the moment, before the outcome is decided and known. You meet Armstrong before the glow of triumph and mission success, when everything was still unproven and in doubt. Also, it captures the home-front extraordinarily well. More melancholy than I expected, but life for any 'hero' is not all roses and well lit paths. Armstrong is an engineer/pilot and compartmentalized personal and professional events at an extraordinary level, as one in his profession should. Gosling executes well, making the viewer feel the weight of the story and events instead of the actor merely displaying the emotions, which would've been a discredit to Armstrong's understated personality and quiet exercise of character. Well done and a must see, a wonderful tribute to our nation's best at one of her finest hours.",10,2,4,15 October 2018
