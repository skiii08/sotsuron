Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Everything I wanted, and so much more
","When I was 2 years old, my parents took me to go see Return of the Jedi.  I saw these images that stuck in my head of lightsaber duels and attacking ships.  I've been waiting for this movie ever since.  When the opening came, a tear almost came to my eye, I couldn't believe that after 16 years of waiting it was finally here.  And I loved it.  Everything about it gave me a feeling of awe.  The pod race is the most exciting 10 minutes of film ever seen, until the last half hour.  All at the same time, a ground war was being fought, and exciting space war was being fought, with Anakin Skywalker, and the best lightsaber duel to ever be seen between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Darth Maul is fought.  This is that one movie I'll tell my grandkids about, and tell them how the old days were like, because this is it.",10,0,0,22 May 1999
Face_Off," The Best
","The Best Movie of the decade.  Period.  Nothing can beat this.  Great performances (especially by Joan Allen), awesome action scenes, and real emotion.  You can actually believe the characters are doing what they're doing.  The Best.",10,1,2,16 April 1999
Meet Joe Black," Not What I Suspected
","I never expected myself to like it as much as I did.  Ok, Brad Pitt did seem rigid sometimes, but who cares.  This movie is so good.  Anthony Hopkins is great as the dying billionaire, and Claire Forlani is an actress I hope to see more of.  Go see this film right now.  It's one of the best romantic movies in a long time.",10,1,2,18 April 1999
The Matrix," Oh My God
","I went into this movie thinking it would be just a movie to pass the time. But was I wrong.  From the moment it starts it captures you into its web of twists and turns.  It has the best special effects I've seen in a long time, and the best action sequences since Face/Off.  Go see this movie RIGHT NOW.",10,0,0,16 April 1999
Tarzan," Ahhhhhhhh!!
","This Tarzan is really good for the whole family.  Really digged how he 'surfed' through the trees, really cool.  Minnie Driver as Jane stole the show, but everyone did a good job, with the exception of a certain loud-mouthed New York talk show host. See this movie!!",9,1,1,19 June 1999
