Changeling," Fantastic!
","I saw this film today, and after much excitement to see it i was overcome by how good it actually was! Im not a fan of these sort of period dramas but true story's are usually some of the best and seeing Angelina Jolie taking the main role...The films set in the 20's where a young mother Christine Collins returns home from work to find her son missing, when the police reunite her with whom they think is her son, Christine takes all action necessary to get her real son back.There's a lot more to this film than i expected, it was pretty horrible and some points but most of all it was really sad.I advise anyone to watch it!",10,6,10,29 November 2008
The Others," Chilling!
","This original period horror is set during World War II where a mother of two make home to an enormous house. Not long into their stay, the mother believes the house is haunted by a family, however a much needed truth is pretty much twisted in a bundle of suspense and mystery...This film is great for anyone who loves to sit on the edge of their seat although you don't want to sit next to anyone who talks a lot either. The Others is one of those films where you need to concentrate otherwise you'll miss vital bits, it also ruins the hole mood if somebody's talking. Just make sure you have a pillow in front of you abd something to dig your nails in...",8,4,5,1 December 2008
Juno," Overrated...
","I didn't really want to see this film but since its Valentines day, i thought id' go with the flow and see it with a few mates. I had no clue what it was about and expected it to be pretty boring.At first the film seemed unsurprising and cheesy but then there was more of a story-line to it. The film consists of romance, pressure, guilt and a typical school American teens which basically makes it entertaining. I wouldn't say its amazing but there's quite a few different story-lines going on which are pretty funny. I would say its overrated though, i didn't expect it to be in the top 250# but its a unique film i guess.",6,7,18,14 February 2008
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Better than the book?
","After the 3rd Harry Potter film I found it hard to tell the difference between the latest 3, they all seemed a bit confusing, yet that hasn't stopped me from being first in the line for every Potter film that comes out and this was no exception...I read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows three times, I absolutely loved it! I was prepared to point out loads of missing parts from the new film, and I was wrong. This was utterly fantastic!! They've definitely gone up a notch in terms of quality and acting. As you probably know, the series is drawing to a close which means everything and anything is happening. I'm not going to spoil it but its definitely my favourite so far, every scene in the film was what I imagined in the book which in my case made the film arguably better.I also want to warn everyone that it is quite scary and there are a few jumpy bits! I'm surprised this isn't rated a 12. (Lady next to me screamed about a hundred times, I wanted to pour my popcorn over her head)",9,0,4,20 November 2010
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," I enjoyed it
","As a 17 year old boy, I knew this would be the sort of thing girls would talk about for the rest of the school year but I had to see it for myself as a really enjoyed Twilight and in my school its kind of compulsory to like this...After 2 and a half hours, I left feeling satsified with this film, if not more. Since I haven't read the book there were parts when I didn't know what the hell was going on, but I usually just guessed what happened really as most of the time its pretty obvious.I've never been so annoyed with a character in all my life, I wanted to slap Kirsten at some points of the film! I was really annoyed they chucked in way too much of Bella's depression, it was really boring but I guess it really paid off in the long run. Robert Pattison was a slight outcast in the film with the main story set on Bella and Jacobs relationship. we see ourselves forcing to choose sides between the Vampires and the Werewolves! (Werewolves for me, I find the Vampires are way too stiff and spend a lot of the time pouting).Aside from some obvious make-up used in the film this really beats some of the Harry Potter films by miles...Oh & what a treat to see Dakota Fanning!",8,5,12,20 November 2009
Halloween," A great slasher movie!
","This is a classic horror movie which fills all the areas of satisfactory for horror fans! Michael Myers is probably the best killer in the history of films! But its a shame they continued the franchise, i guess you could say the first 4 are classics and perhaps Halloween H20. When i think of Halloween now i cant help watching the rest after the first and thats a bad thing because the rest are crap! The only problem of the first is really the violence... as you don't expect, there's not enough!!!! hardly any compared to Friday the 13th Its a shame too since the first was such a great movie, and still is!Just make sure you watch the right Halloween.",7,0,1,26 August 2008
