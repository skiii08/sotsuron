Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars and the Phantom Storyline
","'Star Wars' gave us powerful icons; 'The Empire Strikes Back' turned them into meaningful characters; 'Return of the Jedi' turned them into action figures.  'The Phantom Menace' flattens them even further, giving us a 2-D world where even the human actors are treated like CGI effects.  Those who glibly state that 'Menace' is wonderful because the visuals are impressive and story doesn't matter seem to have forgotten why we all anxiously awaited this movie for so long, namely, to see how the STORY began.  Lucas was aware enough of this to include it in the film's marketing - 'Every saga has a beginning', etc. - but neglected to include it in the film itself.  Who is Qui-Gon?  Where's he from?  We leave the theatre knowing nothing of consequence about him, or Obi-Wan, or any other character (with the possible exceptions of Shmi Skywalker and R2-D2).  Plot points from the other movies are simply referred to, without being elaborated or enriched in any way. We watch impressive things happen without any real understanding of the people that are doing them.  You rooted for Luke and Han because of who they were, not because they were buried in a sea of CGI images.  Lucas forgot that what has sustained 'Star Wars' for so long is the strength of the story, and has expanded his 'epic' about as well as 'Tomorrow Never Dies' continues the story of 'Dr. No'.",6,0,1,9 August 1999
The Iron Giant," The Best of Two Worlds: Adult and Kid
","All too often, 'family films' are only infantile, simplistic formulas with a few self-referential and pop-culture jokes thrown in to try and keep adults awake.  But then along comes  something like 'The Iron Giant', which is sophisticated enough to demand respect while maintaining a mythic and pure-hearted tone that actually does appeal to the kid in everybody.'The Iron Giant' is refreshingly non-Disney in no end of ways.  Characters seem real and chosen to fit the story, instead of being a superficial reshuffling of an old formula.  The animation definitely has its eye-popping moments, but there are also scenes of great wonderment, pathos, and humour that only top-drawer animation can convey.  The Giant itself is a great character, who only becomes MORE interesting as the film continues (another huge break from Disney).  No scene is wasted in this film, either; every set piece, even the really funny ones, helps either to establish the 'world' of the movie, or to advance the plot.  At no time do you feel that you are merely waiting for the story to crank up again.'The Iron Giant' is funny, exhilarating, and touching as well.  It's sad to see it failing at the box office, as a blunt reminder that the success of films is often in direct proportion to their publicity budget.  Hopefully, though, word-of-mouth will come to its rescue.  Go see it!  Tell your friends!  Then go again!  (Repeat as necessary.)P.S.  I find myself comparing the Iron Giant character to Martin Donovan's character in 'Amateur'.  If there is anyone else on earth who has seen both films you may wish to entertain the notion yourself.",10,161,180,9 August 1999
