Alien 3," The Alien becomes a lapdog
","After the unsettling »Alien« (1979) and the bomastic »Aliens« (1986), »Alien 3« (1992) with its grim tone and slow pace initially looked like a huge dissapointment. It was David Fincher's directorial debut. Nowadays he has to be considered one of the masters of contemporary cinema. But this movie certainly didn't make a good first impression. There are some glaring flaws. First of all, it's unbelievably boring. The first half is slow, predictable and lifeless. It isn't even directed all that well. Today, Fincher is the king of suspense. But in »Alien 3« he works with some of the most tedious jumpscares I've ever seen on screen. It's embarrassing, really. No wonder Fincher himself doesn't like this movie.The alien itself is laughable. The special effects show their age, but not in a good way. »Alien 3« is CGI city. And this CGI makes the alien look like a lapdog, literally. It's just not frightening, and the whole movie feels like inflated trash. In recent years though, people seem to appreciate »Alien 3« more and more. Myself included. Some aspects of the movie work. The brooding atmosphere is well done, even if it makes the movie far less spectacular than its first two installments. The story has some nice themes, even if the overall arc is hamfisted and trivial. Fincher touches some difficult topics: rape, religion and gender. But the execution just isn't there. At the end of the day, »Alien 3« is a strange hybrid, stuck between shlock and arthouse.Because of that, it's one of a kind. If you want to watch a flawed yet interesting movie, »Alien 3« might be worth your time. But overall I'd say Fincher was right to expel his first feature film.",4,1,4,28 April 2018
Alien: Resurrection," Trashy? Yes. Bad? No.
","Scolded by many as a cinematic catastrophe, 'Alien Resurrection' isn't as bad as its reputation. In the fourth installment of the Alien franchise, French Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet revels in B-Movie flavour. It's exaggerated, silly, gory, and (as far as I'm concerned) really entertaining. By the time this movie premiered, many people had a preconceived notion about what an Alien movie ought to be. Jeunet didn't give a s*it about that. I kinda respect that.Of course, there's moments that are plain stupid and overacted as all hell. But try watching this movie from a trash angle; maybe you'll be pleasantly surprised. As a side note, some of the more sexual moments reminded me of HR Giger's style, which is nice touch in my book.",7,0,1,9 February 2019
Knives Out," A delightful throwback to classic whodunnits
","In »Knives Out«, the seemlingly clumsy private investigator Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is hell-bent on illuminating the mysterious suicide of Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), a famous crime novelist. Blanc teams up with Thrombey's shy nurse Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas). But of course, nothing is as it seems; the Thrombey family is as colorful as it is shady.Oh, I love these classy crime movies! You know how it works: An old patriarch dies and his whole family wants to inherit the fortune he leaves behind. And of course, you gotta have a creepy mansion with secret passageways as well as an eccentric private eye. Director Rian Johnson (»The Brothers Bloom«, »The Last Jedi«) follows the tried and true formula to a tee, his love for the genre is apparent. There are some ironic moments and references (»Clue«; »Murder, She Wrote«), but most of the time, Johnson plays it straight.The pacing is fast and entertaining, Benoit Blanc and Marta Cabrera are likeable main characters. Craig apparently had a lot of fun with his portrayal of the strangely clueless Blanc. You always wonder what's the deal with this guy. I personally would have loved to see some kind of backstory for him, but I guess the mystery surrounding him is fascinating as well. De Arma's nervous and kind-harted Marta is very endearing; when you watch this movie, you really want her to get out of this mess unscathed. And yeah, the fact that she has to puke whenever she lies is bloody brilliant.»Knives Out« works very well as an audience flick. The movie theatre was cram-full when I watched it and everyone had a great time figuring out the twists and turns. Of course this movie doesn't reinvent the wheel; a weakness with most of these stories is the fact that the plot tends to become a bit too convoluted at the end. This happens here, too. But regardless, »Knives Out« is a charismatic update to a familiar genre, political undertones and a dumb yet thrilling car chase included. I'm already looking forward to the announced sequel.",8,1,4,19 January 2020
Alien," Edgy and Slick: A Masterpiece of Sci-Fi Horror
","In terms of sci-fi horror, Ridley Scott's »Alien« is as good as it gets. As many people have pointed out, the story is basically B-movie stuff: a spooky monster haunts some hapless people, only this time they're in space. Scott stages the rather simple plot like an arthouse flick, beginning with the slick and lifeless introduction to the space ship Nostromo. The atmosphere is unbelievably tense throughout the movie: from the industrial Nostromo, the stormy planet V-426 to the phallic Alien designed by H. R. Giger. In many ways, »Alien« is the antithesis to Stanley Kubrick's »2001: A Space Odyssey«, the most megalomaniac movie ever conceived. Ridley Scott shows us that space travel won't be about philosophical self-discovery. It will be about dirty, senseless work. Of course, there are also some gender issues at stake here. Sigourney Weaever as Ellen Ripley might be most badass last girl in movie history - and maybe the first female action star that is not reduced to her womanhood. If »Alien« has one problem, it's the fact that it betrays its B-movie roots. There is a wannabe-deep scene near the end of the movie that feels affixed, as if Ridley Scott wanted to reconcile the intellectuals in the movie theater. That wasn't necessary at all. Still, if you're into stylish and evocative sci-fi, horror or sci-fi horror, you need to watch »Alien«. Man, what am I talking about? If you're into movies at all, you need to watch this flick.",9,5,8,8 March 2018
Aliens," A Spectacular Sequel Betraying its Roots
","»Aliens« is a pretty solid sequel to the sci-fi nightmare that was Ridley Scott's »Alien«, but I can't help but feel that James Cameron's effort is overrated. True, »Aliens« rocks as a grade A hollywood actioner. There are some amazing set pieces. Come to think of it, the whole movie is one gigantic set piece. It's entertaining and suspensful as hell.And ... that's about all I can say about it. »Aliens« doesn't give me much to think about, although it has so much more plot than the original. This movie is the definition of a blockbuster: well made and engaging, but ultimatively empty and calculated. What escpecially bugs me is the new character Newt. This sweet little girls serves one purpose and one purpose only: Making Ellen Ripley into a mother. Throughout the whole movie Cameron tries to give Ripley a new family. That's interesting enough (altough it may rise some feministic concerns), but it's handled in a painfully heavy-handed way.Gone is the artful agitation of »Alien«, gone its originality and openness. It's clear that a lot of effort went into »Aliens«, but its emotional core is lacking. It's a worthwhile watch anyway, I'd be a fool to deny the raw power this movie has. It just doesn't feel like an »Alien« flick. Even less so than the much-maligned fourth installment by Jean-Pierre Jeunet.",7,0,4,9 March 2018
Gone Girl," A Cynical, Masterful Caricature of Modern Relationships
","Amy and Nick Dunne are young, stylish and charming. The immaculate dream couple? It seems so, at least on the face of it. But infidelity and financial troubles let the glamorous façade crumble. One morning, Amy disappears without a trace, and Nick becomes suspect. Did he kill his wife? The media depict him as an uncaring husband, and he's trying desperately to correct that image. But what if he really is the murderer everyone believes him to be?'Gone Girl', based on the Gillian Flynn novel of the same name, is a masterful thriller, a sharp-sighted media satire and a cynical analysis of modern marriage. Flynn herself wrote the screenplay for the movie adaptation, and David Fincher turns the already disturbing story into something even darker. 'Gone Girl' is a perfect fit for Fincher, as it is concerned with two of his favorite themes: gender issues and modern media. The main topic here is how the media are shaping our own identities. Nick Dunne has to adapt to the expectations of the public in order to survive. As his lawyer Tanner Bolt puts it: 'This case is about what people think of you.'Amy and Nick both just play a character. They pretend to be a perfect couple. The movie suggests that pretending and being are not as far apart as we tend to think. When everyone plays along, the shallow masks are going to work. The much-maligned ending underlines this insight perfidiously. It's the point where 'Gone Girl' becomes a pitch-black social satire. The last act isn't a thriller anymore, it's a grotesque caricature of modern relationships. I've never seen anything like it, and I can't praise Fincher enough for the risk he took with the last half an hour of this movie. Ben Affleck is great as the insipid husband Nick. You love to hate him. Rosamund Pike is simply mind-blowing. You'll also see Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry in unusual roles. My personal favorite is Carrie Coon as Nick's caring yet foul-mouthed sister Margo. She's the heart of this movie, because unlike everyone else, she genuinely speaks her mind. Kim Dickens as the clever detective Rhonda Boney is pretty approachable, too.'Gone Girl' might be Fincher's most splendid masterpiece yet. This movie is so unsettling and cynical, it feels like it was directed by the love child of Alfred Hitchcock and Lars von Trier. If that's not awesome, I don't know what is.",10,2,2,1 August 2017
1917," Epic in visual scope, but emotionally narrow
","First World War. Blake and Schofield, two British soldiers, have to deliver a message to an isolated regiment. If the message doesn't reach them, 1600 men are going to die. It's going to be a near impossible task for the two young men, but nevertheless they dare to cross the enemy line.Frankly, Sam Mendes' 1917 is a big disappointment. It looks amazing, that much is true, but everything else is severely lacking. Yes, the camera by the always amazing Roger Deakins is a highlight: The scope is unbelievably wide, yet it feels like Deakins is teasing and daring the audience to look beyond the movie screen. Fantastic stuff! But visuals alone don't make a movie.There's rarely a theme in 1917 that feels fresh and daring. It's a textbook war movie: There's a tragic death, a big shootout and a forced moment of tenderness and love. It's so predictable it's almost painful. The set piece at the end is truly breathtaking, but the ending itself is downright sappy.At the end of the day, 1917 doesn't bring many new ideas to the table. It tries to wow the audience with grandiose landscapes, but the two soldiers and their quest keep strangely one-dimensional.",4,6,14,12 February 2020
Evil Dead," Works well enough for a silly, bloody demon flick
","Did we really need a remake of Sam Raimi's iconic horror flick The Evil Dead? Probably not. But you won't hear me complaining. To be honest, I kinda like what I saw. The only thing I truly dislike is the the fact that the main characters are teenagers in the woods. Again. I know that the original also followed this trope, but come on, try something new once in a while! How boring is that? And I didn't need so much backstory for the two main characters Mia and Dave. It felt underdeveloped and overly dramatic at the same time. The script was trying way too hard to be deep. Give me a break. This is a silly demon romp after all. All that being said, if you get past the sappy stuff and take The Evil Dead 2013 for what it wants to be, you'll have a lot of fun.The characters aren't too annoying, pretty likeable actually. There's plenty of gore, some effective jump scares (a bit too many probably) and passable acting. I'm not a big fan of the special effects, they don't always look convincing. Some scenes were downright silly, I wasn't even sure if intentionally or not. By the way, why does every demon look and even sound like Regan from The Exorcist? That threw me off. The ending is a jaw-dropping, epic bloodfest. Very, very cool. Director Fede Alvarez goes crazy with the camera angles in true Raimi style. I felt the whole thing could have been even crazier, but oh well, for a modern ramake this one isn't bad at all. Give it a chance.",7,0,1,16 December 2019
Prometheus," Ridley Scott disenchants the Alien
","When 'Alien' (1979) hit the scene, it was the antithesis of overblown sci-fi with deep questions. It was slick and edgy horror. With 'Prometheus', director Ridley Scott betrays this idea; he's in Kubrick mode. There is no reason to explain what the Alien is, but Scott feels the need to do so anyway. I just don't get it. Some of the ideas are pretty interesting, but the plot is full of stupidity and banalities.Michael Fassbender as the android David is fascinating and Noomi Rapace delivers a heartfelt performance. But other than that, this movie's a pretentious mess; too excessive and cramped. What a waste of talent and money.",4,0,1,10 February 2019
