The Ring," Good, not GREAT
","Just came back from seeing The Ring with my 12 y/o son. We both thought it was entertaining, not the best horror film we've ever seen, but definitely creepy enough to linger in your head. I just had to post because I kept reading others post and ask 'How did the images get on the videotape?'. Well, we inferred that when the kids were there, trying to tape a football game on the tv, as they were directly *over* where Samara was, she magnetically transferred them with her mind. They were her memories! Duh!(Ok, she's a ghost, but she had that power when she was alive.... remember the xray -looking things in her file, and when she was talking to the psychologist? That was the same stuff that videotape is made of, folks!) Rachael was a horrible mother, I really felt very little for her.All in all, since it didn't end when I thought it would, I give it credit for not going the cheesy, happy Hollywood ending route. 7 out of 10.",Null,0,0,24 October 2002
