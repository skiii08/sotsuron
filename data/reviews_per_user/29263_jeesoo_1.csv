Captain Phillips," Really good movie broken by cinematographers ...
","'I haven't been this impressed with the work of Tom Hanks in years. Putting every ounce of his charm to good use but digging deep into a character with such raw and emotional fervency. Hanks' dedication and abilities utilized are the same tools used in his first Oscar-winning performance in 'Philadelphia' I assure you. It's a turn that could make him this year's Daniel Day-Lewis. As his wife, the beautiful Catherine Keener is regulated to one single scene, at the beginning of our film, where Hanks dominates the conversation. Still a cherry on top if you ask me but not something that many will notice nor remember..' Someone wrote this and he was right. But he rated this movie with big 10. And i simple disagree.Everything about this movie is fine. Except one thing : cinematography. Camera work is terrible. Shaking, awful, making people dizzy. It;s not the firs movie like that. It's happening more often nowadays. Let's just rate this movie with 1 ! Let's just let makers to know that we don't want to see Parkinson's movies anymore. We don't want to feel sick after 30 minutes anymore. I wish to see skillful cinematographers and admire their work - because in this case it's just rubbish ...1 from me. You destroyed really nice movie.",1,18,43,8 January 2014
