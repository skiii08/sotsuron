Casablanca," Lighting provides light into the character's pasts...
","The lighting in this movie is phenomenal and very expressive. Rick's Caf√© Americain provided the perfect scene in which to express various lighting techniques that foreshadowed the pasts and the futures of the characters that found refuge there. Particular attention was paid to Ingrid Bergman's character where the light dazzled in her eyes, caught the top of her hair, and shadowed her face in the reflection of a mysterious woman with pain and sorrow as much as happiness and joy. The bars that shadowed the walls in the scenes that peaked into Rick's office, as if we were spying or stumbling onto something forbidden, portrayed the secret lives of Rick and Ilsa and the cage that not only they, but others caught in the net set by the Nazi's, lived in.",Null,0,1,16 March 2011
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head
","Having never watched 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' (1969) before, I must admit that a lot more references in other works that I never used to quite get, make sense now. More specifically, I can now say that after many years of watching 'Spy Hard' (1996), I finally understand the significance of the bicycle scene over which 'Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head' plays.'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' (1969), besides being loosely based on actual events (which I found interesting), brought a new aspect to filming. This aspect was the way it used the glorifying of violence to portray the violence in a thought provoking manner. I feel previous films neglected to use strong and very visible violence because it was inappropriate to do so, but for this film it worked, and we have witnessed violence grow more persistent in films ever since.",Null,0,1,13 May 2011
The Grapes of Wrath," Appreciated the Cinematography!
","The Grapes of Wrath (1940) is definitely a well put together film that reflects a wide range of emotions including sadness and anger, which were commonly expressed during the Great Drepression, as well as hope. The camera seemed able to capture all of these emotions in the empty surroundings that showed the barren land, and in the haunted looks of the characters as they faced a hardship that too many real people faced in the Great Depression. I liked how the cinematography showed the empty spaces in several shots while also focusing on the individual silhouettes outlined in between the empty space. I thought this technique showed people as dark 'shadows' on the screen, pointing out the fact that they were shadows of who they used to be.",Null,0,0,10 May 2011
The Graduate," New vs. Old
","The Graduate (1967) is not just about an unsure young man seduced by his dad's business partner's wife, and then somehow along the way happens to fall in love with her daughter, but a movie about the juxtaposition between the new generation and the old, 'the establishment' and the generation gap between them. It also was about the shaking off the old establishment, or the Hayes Code, by introducing topics that hadn't been touched since the Cencorship Code was instated in 1934. The Graduate (1967) explores content dealing with nudity, sexual relationships and affairs, showing a man and woman in the same bed, a strip-club scene, and even a scene involving the main character 'defiling' a cross (which no doubt was another slap to the establishment).",Null,0,0,11 May 2011
Singin' in the Rain," Deserves your applause...
","What I really liked about this film was the variety of dance and music sequences that appeared in it, making it the musical it became. The songs paired with dances were vibrant and full of life adding to the experience of this well rounded story depicting the difficult transitions studios and actors had going from silent films to sound films. The film is very well put together and seamlessly moves from one scene to the next.Perhaps the best scene, was when Cosmo set out to make Don laugh in the song and dance number, 'Make Him Laugh'. As the scene unfolds, you see the true comedy is in the accidental funny moments (although fully on purpose on behalf of the cast) as Cosmo uses improvisation to whip up some complex moves, such as running up the side of a wall and flipping off of it, and of course, some much welcomed laughs too.",Null,0,1,11 May 2011
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Revealing
","I remember when I first watched this movie as a kid, at my friend's house, how much it revealed to me about mental health facilities and the inhuman treatments and abuse many patients used to face.Now, rewatching it I am able to grasp some of the more subtle points that I may have missed as a child, such as chaos versus order, and inside (inside the hospital) versus outside (outside the hospital). These themes are shown throughout the film, specifically pertaining to showing chaos vs. order. One specific scene pits the chaos within the facility against the order of the facility, the nurses, using classical music to create order among the chaos. Of course, as it happens, the classical music fails to create order, instead it plays loudly over top the chaos adding to it.",Null,0,2,10 May 2011
