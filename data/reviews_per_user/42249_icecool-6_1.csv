The Longest Yard," Longest Yard Review from Premiere
","Going into see 'The Longest Yard' thinking I was going to see a good movie. Turned out to be that I went to see a great movie. Diffently the top comedy of the summer, may be the top comedy of the year. When teaming up Columbia, Paramount, and MTV and with association of course with Happy-Madison Productions there's a good start. Throw in Adam Sandlar and Chris Rock and you have a new comedy duo never thought imagined. This movie had the whole audience rolling. Not an unhappy face left the theater of thousand. Clapping and applauding at the end, laughing, and smiles for a movie that can be seen with all generations. Good humor, good flow, and there isn't any long drawn out scenes to lose you attention. Diffently recommended two thumbs up. Cameron E Grimm, The Entertainment World",10,4,16,21 May 2005
