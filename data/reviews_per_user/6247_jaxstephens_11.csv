The Ring," Very well done modern scary movie.
","I went into this movie with it being hyped up a little too much, so I don't think it was as scary as it could be, but it was still a wonderful example of how scary movies *should* be done. _The Shining_ and _The Exorcist_ are boring snoozefests and don't even scare my easy-to-frighten wife. _The Ring_, on the other hand, is a stylist, creepy, and highly entertaining film. I would recommend it *highly* to anyone.*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ***The only gripe I have with the movie is that it should have ended a few scenes earlier. Instead, it felt as if the filmmakers had to wring out the last bit of energy possible for no good reason at all. The result was that the overall spookiness was diminished, and the plot lost some of its momentum and power.",10,0,0,14 December 2002
Citizen Kane," A major disappointment.
","I saw this movie for the hype--'best movie ever'! Or so say a bunch of dusty ol' critics. Perhaps this movie was much better in its time, but today it is just boring and slow going. Watch it if you're interested in seeing a piece of history, but don't expect too much *entertainment*.",4,2,7,14 December 2002
Memento," One of the best movies ever!
","From both an artistic and entertainment standpoint, this is by far one of the best films ever made. It lacks big stars, big budget, and big effects, but it is so masterfully crafted and the story is so excellently told. I will not give away more than is necessary, but the chronology of the story--that is, the scenes--unfolds backwards. It's a little disorienting at first, but then the experience completely engages you. _Memento_ is unlike any film or television show I have ever seen--a true original. Go out and see it today! You will not be disappointed.",10,0,2,14 December 2002
Constantine," Overburdened by Religious Elements
","While the film includes some interesting visuals, it is bogged down by rather heavy-handed Catholic theology. If you don't subscribe to such beliefs, like me, you find yourself unable to care about the plot or see it as worth your effort to understand. All in all, I was rather bored by the end and found myself looking at the clock. It felt like I was watching the Catholic equivalent of the cheesy Protestant _Left Behind_ series.Let's see, what else? Keanu Reeves' acting isn't so hot, even for his usual style, and certain elements of the storyline don't make much sense. I kept wondering if this was better watched after having read the comic book or something. I'm betting that is the case.The overall verdict: not worth watching if you aren't Catholic.",4,0,1,7 December 2008
Final Destination 2," Entertaining, but not as effective as the original.
","Okay, so sequels are rarely as good as the originals, and this is yet another case that confirms this. However, the film was still somewhat entertaining to watch, so it wasn't a total loss. The original was a very well-told story that simply creeped you out. It had a dark, foreboding feeling to it, which is exactly what this type of movie should have. Also, it didn't attempt to explain very much, instead leaving much to the viewer's imagination, which is often the most effective way to approach these topics.Final Destination 2 lacks all of the characteristics I just mentioned. The acting is so absolutely horrible, and the dialogue is lame, too. While I enjoyed how the writers tried to tie this movie to the first, the overall story was simply idiotic and flawed, mainly due to explaining more than we need to know. (And what was that crap about 'a new life' clearing the list? Please!) Most unforgivingly of all, though, this movie lacks that creepy feeling the first one had. Instead, Final Destination 2 is mainly concerned with delivering the strangest and goriest deaths possible. If that is fun enough for you, then this is the movie for you.To sum things up, here are some helpful recommendations: * If you haven't seen the original, go see it first. * If you really, really liked the original, then see the sequel. * If you didn't like or only mildly enjoyed the original, then stay away from the sequel. * If you like gore flicks, see this one. It's a little more explicitly bloody than most mainstream American films.",7,0,0,2 February 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," A Horrible Disappointment
","I loved the first movie. I even liked the second in the hope that its ideas would be delivered on. But the third movie was a convoluted, ugly, violent, and confusing heap of trash. I left the movie so disappointed and depressed that I wondered why I even liked The Matrix in the first place. It was just that bad. I'm sorry, I just can't say much of anything that is redeeming about the film.Much of the signature Matrix action is gone, and what there is of it (Smith vs. Neo) is laughable. The dialogue is horrible. So many characters are never developed. The ending is nonsense. And the gory scenes, missing from the previous two movies, gave the third installment a dark and unpleasant feeling. (Normally I don't mind that, but it felt out of place for series.) Once again, a complete disappointment. The best concept of the series (man vs. machine) is completely forgotten about in a messy shift toward pseudo-spiritual, philosophic drivel and a lame plot that make Agent Smith an independent bad guy from the other machines.Rating: 4/10",4,0,0,12 January 2004
The Shining," Extremely boring and not scary at all.
","Ah, they sure don't make 'em like they used to--and thank goodness for that. This movie is not scary by today's standards, and it is so absolutely boring that I wanted to turn it off after 20 minutes. Do not listen to the hype! This is your standard lame and uninteresting Stanley Kubrick film. Why people call him a genius is beyond me, because I find most of his films unbearable. If you want a better scary film, see _The Ring_.",4,12,27,14 December 2002
The Exorcist," Horribly boring and awful 'classic.'
","I set out to watch this movie since many rate is as the scariest of all time. Boy, was I ever disappointed. My wife is scared of *everything*, but we watched this snoozefest in a dark bedroom, and she barely blinked (except during the spider-walk scene). I was so bored after 30 minutes that I wanted to turn the thing off, but no, I had to keep going to see if it got better. I want those two hours of my life back! 1970s scary does not equal 2002 scary.",2,7,29,14 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Not as great as the hype.
","I saw this movie earlier than I usually see movies because of the hype surrounding it, and I must say that it doesn't live up to its potential. Despite what most people say, I think the first movie was more solid and well done than this one. The Two Towers is too choppy and disjointed, and many scenes are just unbelievable and ridiculous. Also, I feel that many boring scenes could have been removed without affecting the narrative too much. Finally, many effects are simply laughable. Don't get me wrong--this was a good movie compared to most--but it is not excellent, nor is it better than The Fellowship of the Ring. I give it an 8/10. The first one was a 9.5.",8,0,0,27 December 2002
Final Destination," A unique and absolutely entertaining thrill ride.
","Okay, I'm not going to be naive and say this is the best movie ever or that its artistic qualities are the highest, but I will tell you this much: This is a fun movie to watch. And in the end, don't we see movies to be entertained? If that is the case, I give this film a 10 out of 10. The concept is great and well executed, and even though the movie isn't necessarily very scary, it does sometimes give you the chills. Just think how you'd feel if Death were coming after you! This is an excellent movie, and I would highly recommend it to everyone. Just don't over-analyze it; sit back and be entertained.",9,0,2,24 January 2003
Cube," Unique and interesting movie--worth seeing.
","My wife and I stumbled across this movie while channel surfing one night. It was right at the beginning, and let's just say that the opening scene kept us watching. (Ever see a person 'cubed' before? :-) Anyway, this film is very unique and suspenseful. It's not perfect, and the story loses some of its mystique as details are revealed, but ultimately this is an entertaining movie that I would recommend to anyone. I give it a 9/10.",9,0,1,29 December 2002
