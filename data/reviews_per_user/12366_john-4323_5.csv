National Treasure: Book of Secrets," National Disgrace
","OK so the first instalment was hardly rocket science but this is just plain awful. If you can get past the unbelievable plot line and excuse the cardboard acting from most of the cast then you have the Scooby doo script to deal with. This City has been missing for over 1000 years... Oh wait there it is.. but wait we cant get in, hang on it says if you see a pig playing a banjo while there is a full moon then the door will open... hang on I have such a pig, how convenient. This is totally crap for mindless idiots and I like mindless films. If you value the time known as life then save yourself 2 hours of it and miss this garbage out.",1,10,16,2 October 2008
The Equalizer," More average than equal
","Saw this on DVD and to be fair it starts off well but the plot line is paper thin and predicable down to the script. It has plenty of action and is a good film for Denzel as i like most of his past work. Near to the end of the film it seems the writers were asked to take a hike and a producer took over as it turns from a nice, action movie to a mushy 'gee ma can we be American too?' type situation, which is not required, wanted or enjoyed. More mush and gush than Tom Cruise talking about himself, ugh. For me this ruined what was an enjoyable experience and the last action sequences are stupidly ridiculous which also ruins then film. Only watch if there is nothing better on.",6,2,3,7 April 2015
John Wick," A REAL action movie!
","Saw this on DVD thinking that it would be another dull movie staring Keanu, Boy was i wrong. This has got to be up there with Point Break and Matrix for his best films to date. He stars as the typical action hero / anti-hero and unlike all the usual crap talk about how hard the main character is in all of Tom Cruise's films this one actually measures up. Its not stop action all the way and there isn't any stupid CGI to take over the screen or unbelievable action sequences that defy the laws of physics or gravity which is a major bonus in my book. If you want a flash to past when action hero's were tall, mean and shot lots of people then this is the movie for you.",10,2,7,7 April 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," Team America **** Yer!
","The epitome of bad taste wrapped up in an advert to the world of the all American hero is once again pushing sickly sweet crap down the throats of consumers. If you thought independence day was a load of rubbish then you're going to hate this garbage also. Having wasted the hour or so watching this film I have to say, I want my life back and yes it is that awful. The star of the fantastic four is dressed in a leotard and prancing around and single handedly taking on a large army of superior armed soldiers and winning. Yes he can simply walk undetected into highly secret bases unnoticed while wearing his unconvincing garish costume for all to see. Somehow everyone who shoots at him aims for a small shield and without any noticeable super powers takes on the might of the Nazi power. 'Enemy at the gates' this is not, nor is it a fun or family film, in fact i would go as far to say that this is nothing more than propaganda of the most ridiculous kind as the world will always be a better place with the good ol' US of A involved. On a scale of 1 to 100 i would vote this marginally above a Tom Cruise film but below any sanitary or worth your while to watch. Avoid at all cost, Pass me the bucket i think I'm going to puke",1,40,82,6 March 2012
Casino Royale," Daniel is no monkey
","First and foremost this is a really good film, only one thing prevented it from being a GREAT film, still watch it at the cinema! The pre-opening sequences reminded me of Agent 47 from the game Hit-man, cool stylish, well designed, thought about and stunning. Next the opening sequences, gone are the dancing girls behind crappy lights; even as an avid bond fan I was glad to see them make a complete refreshing change. The action is jaw dropping and on from the get go, Daniel's acting and stylish personal touches make Pierce Brosnan look like a monkey that could talk. Gone are the cheesy one liners and 19 year old girls for an ageing lesario, For your eyes only... ugh! Gone are the chest wigs and the unbearable idea of women finding Bond irresistible, as well as the carry-on style names like 'IVona Humpalot'. Gone are the old rubbish jokes there are new ones which are actually funny! Gone are the stupid women (Denise Richards) and really crappy gadgets (invisible Aston). Daniel comes out of the sea like Ursula Andress and all the women in the cinema were as wet as October. People get shot, stabbed and bond gets hurt, when did Roger Moore ever put a hair out of place when fighting the giant Jaws? This film relied on brilliant acting and great plot lines. Forget the negative reviews from people who said they couldn't follow it; a trained monkey could follow it. The downsides include little things missing, like no air bags in the smashed Â£250,000 Aston Martin, no acting ability in Eva Green and no one shouting stop when Bond says 'I love you'... STOP!!! Yes people Bond falls in love. Now up until the start of this sequence you had me in awe and I was giving this film 10, then some dumb schmuck thought it would be great to not only introduce some love scenes but a marriage proposal as well.... UH? This is James Bond for god sake, take two lovelies into the shower? No I just shag and go! This monstrosity not only destroyed the illusion you get from being engrossed in a fantastic film but board me sh*tless because like Monty Python I wanted to say 'GET ON WITH IT!' after what seemed an eternity. It was like watching Pride and Prejudice and half expected Jeremy Beadle to enter the cinema telling me it was a joke! When that rubbish was out the way the film tried to get us back into the mood but the moment had gone. Some good stunts and rubbish CGI of a falling building and as an evil person would you really have two, yes 2!, henchmen with dodgy eyes because low and behold we met the 2nd one... what are the chances of that happening? The one bit that ruined this film - the last twenty minutes, such a let down. Good but so close to being great.",8,0,1,6 December 2006
