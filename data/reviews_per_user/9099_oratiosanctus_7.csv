The Incredible Hulk," Far better than it gets credit for
","At the time this film was released, audiences still had a sour taste in their mouths from Ang Lee's ill-fated 2003 Hulk movie. I remember seeing this one in a small theatre to hardly anyone there in attendance. That aside, what The Incredible Hulk does well and what no other Hulk film has managed quite as successfully since is to truly show the duality between the Bruce Banner and Hulk personalities.There is a real sense of urgency throughout this entire film, even long before its main villain pops up -- a rarity in MCU movies, where much of the drama is centered around the rise of the film's supervillain. How the movie does this is through its clever use of exposition in the movie's ingenious opening sequence along with the fugitive storyline that has been at the core of many classic Hulk comic books.Director Louis Leterrier shoots some gorgeous sequences throughout this film: from the lush evergreens of Brazil to Culver University and onwards, the film always feels open and brings something visually interesting to the screen. The best sequence, however, goes to our first on-screen introduction to the Green Goliath within a bottle factory. Shot like a horror film, Hulk is painted as the monstrous force of nature that he is. I still remember smiling widely throughout that whole sequence the first time I saw it, and it still has that effect on me now.Where the film falters is sometimes in the CGI, especially in the final act and confrontation between Hulk and the Abomination. Some moments script-wise are also predictable. Where it succeeds is in its sharp wit instead of by a need for slapstick like later MCU flicks.The cast are all top-notch, with Edward Norton's Banner convincing throughout. Tim Roth's Blonsky/Abomination is a highlight and poses a real threat to Hulk and others, bringing Hulk to his knees on a number of occasions. This is a solid superhero movie.",7,0,2,7 October 2018
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," The sequel we deserved following the stakes of The Avengers
","~Review originally posted via Instagram (at '@oratiosanctus') on May 20th, 2018.***In a post-Infinity War world, does a film like The Winter Soldier still hold its place in the Marvel ranks as one of its best? The simple answer, yes. When the task came to create a Captain America sequel that followed on from the events of The Avengers (2012), the task fell to the Russo Brothers (then newcomers to Marvel Studios) to create a film where the stakes felt higher than ever. How do you do that? By writing an espionage thriller that compromises the very agency the heroes always thought they could rely on, S.H.I.E.L.D.Watching this film again after a fair few years past, I was delighted by how well it still holds up; not only as a superhero flick but as a riveting and hard-edged drama. At its core, this is essentially a film that is a story of brothers: both new and old; one's gained and those lost. It's there The Winter Soldier finds its heart. Even if you remove the excellent action set-pieces that drive a huge part of this movie or the gorgeous cinematography that fill its almost every frame, the performances by each member of the cast - from Chris Evans' Steve Rogers/Captain America to Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, to Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury and Cobie Smulder's Maria Hill - is the movie's real strength. The actor's performances are carried home by these threatened notions of family and the comfort that had once come with that.Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson/Falcon gives a wonderful turn in this movie, breathing life into the picture as a likeable ally to Cap, but it's with Sebastian Stan's phenomenal turn as the mysterious Winter Soldier that the film finds its true standout. No longer the Bucky we knew, he is every bit as shocking and threatening as he needed to be and Stan's performance is one driven by tragedy and emotional loss. He is utterly convincing in the role.Captain America: The Winter Soldier holds its place as one of the MCU's most consistent films to date, and is a must-watch for all Marvel fans.",9,0,0,21 May 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," The event we've all waited a decade for was worth the hype!
","Review originally posted via Instagram ('@oratiosanctus') on April 29, 2018:~Avengers: Infinity War was a film I was eagerly anticipating for not just months, but years. Ever since Iron Man took first flight in 2008 and Thanos turned to smile at the audience in the mid-credits scene of the first Avengers movie in 2012. A decade in the making. The Russo Brothers do an amazing job of making this film come across like that. Infinity War had the monumental task of bringing together plot threads from 18 previous films in Marvel's Cinematic Universe, but also to live up to the enormous ambition it had set for itself. Does it? Let's talk about it.This film is an event, an action blockbuster that carries itself with real stakes and a truly mesmerising performance from Josh Brolin as the Mad Titan himself, Thanos. Here is a villain who is layered, menacing, and emotionally resonant. It is not hyperbole to state that for the first time in the MCU, the villain of this picture is its true star. The CGI work on Thanos is impeccable and Brolin's motion capture is jaw-dropping. This sits on the level of Andy Serkis' Gollum and Caesar.One of the biggest fears going into this was how would it balance such a huge cast of characters? It does so admirably. Most are given their time to shine, and characters like Scarlet Witch and Vision are given their all to by their respective actors. This isn't a movie of one-liner cameos. Infinity War is undoubtedly Marvel's darkest and most daring film to date, and it tackles this with respect for what's come before it and to the pursuit of its own enormity.However, like all of Marvel's movies, it is not without its flaws. The Children of Thanos (or The Black Order) are entertaining, if not at times, disposable. Ebony Maw is the clear standout and he steals every scene he's in. Proxima Midnight, Corvus Glaive, and Cull Obsidian are less interesting. The CG work is, at times, also lacking. While some characters you love will not get as much screen-time as others, the movie does a surprisingly effective job of making it appear they do.This is one film guaranteed as best experienced on the big screen.",9,1,2,9 May 2018
A Quiet Place," One of the most surprising and effective films of the year!
","*Review originally posted via Instagram ('@oratiosanctus') on April 15, 2018*~I can't remember the last time I was in a theatre and felt this genuinely engrossed in the viewing experience and on the edge of my seat for the entirety of the film as I was with this one. For a film that's silent for the majority of its run-time, I was completely captivated.This is an intelligent and tense thriller, with likeable, relatable characters who make logical choices and are capable of things that make sense in the setting that's been set up for them and the nature of who they are as characters. It also features a concept that while not wholly originally (consider 1989's Tremors) does feel remarkably fresh and different and tackles ideas in a way that is fascinating and exciting to watch. It also has you care for this family and the new way of living they're forced to adopt when up against an almost insurmountable enemy.I cannot recommend A Quiet Place enough. Along with Netflix's Annihilation, these two movies are currently at the top of my list for 2018 so far. Bravo to director/actor John Krasinski, actors Emily Blunt, Millicent Simmonds, and Noah Jupe, and everyone else involved in the making of this picture. Hollywood needs more films like this one.",10,3,5,11 May 2018
The Witch," A slow-burner that will work for some, but not all
","I recently watched The VVitch for the first time, after having heard great things about it for some time. Albeit, this was a very unusual film, and one that I grappled with for a little while to reach a conclusive idea of my final thoughts towards it. As the directorial debut of Robert Eggers, The VVitch (as it is stylised in the promotional material) is a film that germinates in your mind and leaves a stronger lasting impression days after watching more than it leaves an immediate one.There is a great deal of subtlety that is utilised in this movie, and it is from the age-old concept of the 'fear of the unknown' that the film finds its niche. However, where the film has and will likely continue to divide some audiences is in its presentation. This was a remarkably bleak looking film, full of greys and darker tones; with not a skerric of any real colour to be found. By design, it is a washed-out looking movie. Set in the 17th century with a recently banished lone Puritan family at its centre, the movie is meant to present the hardships and blandness of that era and it does so by its choice of colour palette. The use of Early Modern English in the dialogue is another talking point. The use of this style of language will be jarring to some but it works effectively enough in the context of the film's setting, and apparently, at times was plucked word-for-word from local journals recovered from that period. While each member of the cast does a great job making it feel genuine, there are moments where it feels as if the archaic dialogue gets in the way of plot and character progression.This movie is the definition of a slow burn, having more in common with The Babadook than The Conjuring. Anya Taylor-Joy turns out a wonderful performance and is convincing in her role as the family's eldest child, who questions her existence as the family question their faith. This is a difficult film to recommend and is an atypical horror film, designed to creep under your skin than to shock outright. It is one more in line with those from the turn of the century.",7,1,3,7 October 2018
Iron Man," When Iron Man took flight, so did our hearts
","It's wild to think that a whole decade has already passed since Iron Man was released. I still remember sitting in the theatre and looking over at my dad and smiling when the opening notes of AC/DC's Back In Black introduced us to the cocky but loveable industrialist Tony Stark, portrayed to perfection by Robert Downey, Jr. Few actors have ever felt as born to play a particular role as this one. The only other that comes to mind is Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool.This is one of those rare films that doesn't feel dated and I feel that much of that can be accredited to how it was shot and the casting. Virtually all of the cast fill their roles in this movie exceptionally well, with only really Terrence Howard's Rhodey coming off as slightly weaker in areas. Jeff Bridges was an inspired choice for Obadiah Stane who later becomes our main villain, Iron Monger. He steals almost every scene he's in and portrays Stane with a measured level of sinister discretion and outright despicable action. It's sad he doesn't make it out of this one as no Iron Man villain since has had his level of intrigue. That being said, his best moments are definitely when out of the suit. When he actually becomes the Iron Monger, oddly enough, the film feels like it actually loses a bit of grit.Back on the topic of Downey, Jr. and individuals who steal scenes, even ten years down the road, every nuance and line of dialogue he delivers -- either earnestly or sarcastically -- is a thing of beauty. He nails the dual aspects of Stark's egotism and Iron Man's heroism. This is a top-tier film from beginning to end, and although not as nuanced as its other competitor of that year, Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, Iron Man is a film that embraces its own sense of fun and seriousness with complete conviction.",9,0,0,7 October 2018
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A film that rightfully defined a generation, but also hasn't aged as well in other areas
","*Review originally posted via Instagram ('@oratiosanctus') on April 27, 2018*~Considered by many (myself, included) as Wes Craven's masterpiece, A Nightmare on Elm Street is one that utilises what it is, and still remains to this day, one of the more ingenious and original ideas for a horror movie villain to date. A supernatural killer who stalks teenagers in their dreams, the one place none of us can escape. The concept alone is cinematic gold. Robert Englund - who plays the villainous Freddy Krueger - turns out a marvelous performance, offering just the right amount of restraint and menace to be both disturbing and compelling to watch. His constant presence (even when not on screen or only heard by distinct sounds, such as the unnerving screech of his iconic bladed glove) holds the film. His hostile, predatory nature is always felt, and his capabilities as a modern-day bogeyman brings out that primal and scared inner child within who was afraid of the thing lurking under his bed.It is, however, a movie not without its flaws. In fact, a few are quite glaring. Aside from Heather Langenkamp, who delivers a strong performance as the heroine Nancy, the other actors are very hit-and-miss; with the parents characters (Nancy's excluded) being largely forgettable. The special effects also have not aged well in most areas. That aside, the imagination and visual style of this picture is one that stays with you long after the credits roll and features a death scene early in the film that remains one of the most chilling and well executed you will find in any horror film. This movie is one that is made by its atmosphere.For a film made in 1984 on a very modest budget, A Nightmare on Elm Street remains a diamond in the rough for a slasher movement that, at that time, was only starting to gain real traction. The movie's legacy as it stands today speaks for itself.",8,0,0,11 May 2018
