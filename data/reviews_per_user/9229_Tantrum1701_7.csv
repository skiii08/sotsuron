Deja Vu," Thriller extraordinaire
","One of the best movies with Denzel Washington, in my opinion. A terrorist blows up a ferry with a lot of sailors and family on liberty. After reporting about several leads an ATF agent is invited to join a special investigation team. It soon becomes clear that this is about time travel. The story is set in the aftermath of Katrina, which is clearly visible throughout the movie. In fact in the credits the makers have dedicated this movie to the rescuers, helpers and victims of Katrina. Although the story is physically impossible, it is totally believable. Mostly because of the good acting and depth of the characters. Normally I have four or five breaks for coffee or a smoke or I skip parts of the movie, but this one had me glued to the screen. It will most certainly be on my personal top 10. So enjoy.P.S. How about the terrorist's motives? In the end he says: It was not supposed to happen like this. Like what?",8,1,2,12 March 2014
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," This is a pretty good 'How to....'
","In this movie men can recognize the, sometimes horrible, female logic and women see men stumbling through a relationship trying to understand and please their woman. The lead characters have the necessary chemistry, the story is good and so is the acting. Although somewhat predictable, a lot of situations made me really laugh, particularly where Andie leaves and Ben goes after her, suggesting the couples therapy. I enjoyed the movie, surprisingly. It definitely deserves to be called a romantic comedy. And a must see for people who want a funny little insight into a man/woman relationship. I sure want to recommend it.",8,2,3,9 March 2014
Justice League," A $300,000,000 movie with serious flaws.
","For an estimated $300,000,000 movie I expect a certain level of quality. As I was watching the movie I thought Cavill was replaced in some shots by a stand-in, and a bad one at that, but, as I found out later, it was a very bad cgi job. Just to remove Cavill's upper lip facial hair. About the movie I can be short: The attempt at humor was not very successful en acting was just above average. The action scenes were good and I liked the story, but as a whole a bit disappointing. 
Superheroes are superheroes, not comedians.If this is the direction these movies are headed, I see a rather bleak future.",5,2,7,15 February 2018
Ender's Game," Eye candy, but something's missing
","Having never read the book, it's hard to compare the two. But still I got the feeling something was missing.All through the first three quarters of the movie, I found myself wondering what happened from scene to scene. It all seemed so disconnected, so like the jagged edge of a saw and although the special effects were spectacular at times, it could not capture my full attention.After reading some of the reviews, I understood why. There was indeed something missing. Only those parts of the book that could be converted to movie were used, the rest was skipped or deleted, and that was exactly what I experienced watching the movie.That doesn't mean, however, that this was a bad movie. On the contrary, a great performance of Asa Butterfield and the last quarter of the movie made more than up for it. On the whole it was barely satisfactory, so 5.5 out of 10.",6,0,1,1 April 2014
The Lego Movie," Lego movie, yeah right
","I haven't seen it and I will probably never see it, given my immense dislike for these 'things' sprung from the darkest regions of someones mind. Not every comic or toy is suited to make a movie about. I cannot, for the love of god, imagine Lego building blocks being interesting enough for that. Don't get me wrong, it is a great toy for stimulating children's' fantasy and enjoyed by many, but a movie, come on.The fact that so many people rated so high is disturbing and tells us a lot about the expectations of the public and if they are so easily satisfied I truly wonder what awful monsters will be created in the name of the almighty dollar. I sure hope that some of the old 'tinseltown' magic will return and let the studios and production-companies come to their senses. Among todays movies are real gems, real must see movies, but there are far to few to my standards.",Null,0,3,23 February 2014
No Strings Attached," Can it get any worse?
","No really, i've seen overcooked vegetables do a better job.It's flat, not funny, but most of all disappointing. The plot in IMDb was not convincing, but the cast looked promising so I thought, let's watch. Although each of the lead actors have already proved they can act, this was an awful performance by all of them. No sparkling, no chemistry, nothing. I tried to watch, but after some twenty minutes of hoping, I gave up and zapped through the rest in a few minutes and that was even to much.And about the 6.1, the only excuse I can think of is that a lot of people with absolutely no idea how a romcom should be made, have rated this movie. If only I could rate it negative.",1,1,3,28 April 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Assassination of Star Wars
","My expectations were high in anticipation of the new Star Wars episode. The raving reviews and huge success at the box office made me believe this was the best ever Star Wars movie.But how times have changed.My guess is, J.J. Abrams will not be invited to direct a new movie anytime soon. He succeeded in hugely disappointing many fans with this dismal performance. With the flimsy story, the two-dimensional characters, the same desert planet and ice planet, the huge 'gun', it's a bad remake of Episode IV: A New Hope, but then with everything much larger. The only positive aspect is the imagery.In my opinion this team has effectively killed the Star Wars saga. And when reading between the lines in the George Lucas interview about this episode, although he retracted it later: Disappointment!!I sincerely regret my decision to watch it in the cinema and not to wait for DVD or blue ray or free download. In fact, I think I would have been better off not having seen it at all.",1,43,55,5 January 2016
