The Avengers," This movie was everything I wanted and more!!!!!!!!
","So if your wanting an awesome movie for the summer this is so far the number one to go see. It starts off with a bang and doesn't ever leave you wanting much more. Even if you have never seen any of the Solo Avenger(Superhero films in the past 2 years)movies it doesn't matter. Starts off with awesome plot and builds the entire time until the climax of the film happens and you will not even know when it's going to start or finish. If you like the other super hero movies this one will not let you down unless of course you see it after you watch the only other movie worth seeing this summer, 'The Dark Knight Rises'. Only seen teasers for it but know it will be the number one movie, because easily topping it's predecessor, The Dark Knight. I suggest only two movies to watch in theaters this summer are The Avengers, and The Dark Knight Rises. Mr Nolan will absolutely kill the competition with the best Batman movies to date.......(except Jack Nickolson as the joker) Strong 8 out of 10 just because it's a must see film this summer!!! (Only film I have ever given a 10 out of 10 is True Romance because it gives you exactly what you want from a film in every way you could think of)",8,1,8,24 May 2012
