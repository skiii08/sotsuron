The Blair Witch Project," Scary, even if it don't make sense *Spoilers Ahead*
","(Forgive any spelling mistake I made. I am a Chinese and my English is not that good) Let me start off by saying that this is a great movie. It is scary and really gives you something to think about the next time you go camping. The good thing about this movie is the feeling of uneasy stays with you, much like after watching Jaws you will think twice about swimming at the sea. I really really loves it.However, there are times when this movie make no sense. While the way the movie is made and the acting really makes it looks like a 'Real Time, Real Life' feel, the Heather do a lot of things that you wouldn't do if you are in that situation.  For example, after Heather opened the 'Package' and we later saw her filming herself while washing her hand!! While you panicked and want to wash away the blood as soon as you can, you will never think about filming! The scene will make more sense if it was Mike who is filming Heather and ask what SHE is doing.  I understand they want to get back to the car so they won't follow the steam (which they should), however since the tent isn't much of a protection anyway why don't they climb a tree and stay there for a night? It is not a great idea but it least you will see if someone go near you and left a surpise at your door step (or tent step, whatever). Also, at the last part. While you are going into a house and try to save your friend, do you really have time to hold a camera to shoot a film? Anyone who had used a camera knows that it is very hard to search for anything if you are shooting.If turning on a camera is just for using the light, shouldn't it be held on the hand like a tourch, instead of a shooting position? I think the last scene will be better it there is only on cam. shooting.If you could ingor what YOU would do in their situation, the movie is actually very good. I say go watch it!!",Null,0,1,19 October 1999
Alien vs. Predator," To the people who didn' like the movie.
","For all you who think the movie have a lot of pot holes, please read this:If you are a fan of BOTH Aliens and Predators, you should know that for the past 10 years, there are a lot of comic books (Dark Horse comics) and Novels wrote about the cross over of these creatures. Not to mention Two computer games. They have highlighted the relationship between them and also set some background. Because of that, this movie have to follow not only the rules set by the movies but also on the comics and books. The relationship between a Predator and Human female, how Predator may not really have too much advantage when fighting the Aliens( Someone thinks the Predator is not as tough as the frist two movies, but you have to remember, in the first two movies, Predator is fighting Human, which is weaker than Aliens).As for why the Predator have different vision. According to the computer game. Aliens do not have heat signature like humans. The Red/Green they use in pyramid was due to the fact that were set to hunt Aliens. They didn't count on humans to be there!Anyway, before you trush the movie, please do your homework and read all the books. If you think Predator should b tougher. Please the computer game and you will see why even as a predator, you can still get creamed by a fast moving, super strong, attack from all angle Aliens.Perrier",Null,0,0,25 August 2004
