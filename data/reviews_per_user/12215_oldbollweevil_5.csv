Alien 3," Who misses Hicks?
","**contains spoilers**I am very interested in those reviewers who hint at what this moviecould have been with different editing.  I think some of theconcepts are great--the prison planet with the strange religiousmovement could really work, but I felt like not enough was donewith it.  I got the feeling that the director, the writer, or somebodywanted to make a really weird movie, but was told to cut to thechase.  As usual, weirder would have been better.The movie starts with a shock:  the deaths of Hicks and Newt. Yes, it's totally left unexplained how the alien managed to lay eggson the ship before getting kicked off at the end of the secondmovie, but then again, are we so sure that everything about thiscreature's physiology has been completely revealed in the first twofilms?  In other words, it doesn't make much sense, but itshouldn't really bother us.  As for the deaths, I didn't miss Hicks at all.  He was just anotherone of those annoying commandos in Aliens.  Newt, on the otherhand...after all the effort Ripley put into saving her in the previousmovie, to have her killed was really depressing.  But I think it reallyworks for Ripley's character--as the series goes on she gets moreand more existential, and more and more she realizes her fate isintertwined with that of the alien.  I don't think her decision to throwherself into the furnace at the end would have been as easy, or asconvincing, had Newt still been around to need her.Clement was a great character, and what a change to allow Ripleya romantic interest.  His death, so early in the movie, was a bigshock, but in retrospect I think it was timed just about right.  If hehad died at the end, after he and Ripley had fallen completely inlove, it would have made her sacrifice look like a love suicide;  asis, they weren't yet in love--she was just beginning to trust him, andbang, he's gone.  The tragedy is perhaps even greater becausethe potential in their relationship had not yet been fulfilled.That said, I think the movie does go downhill from there.  None ofthe other characters are developed enough to make you careabout them.  If the cult story had been developed more, Dillon'scharacter could have really been something (and the strangereligious elements of the first and fourth movies might have mademore sense), but as was he was basically just another commando type.The ending is spectacular, though:  not only Ripley's memorabledeath, but her confrontation with the Company's men, who areeven more evil than the aliens.  Like a lot of the action sequencesin the second half, this confrontation comes out pretty confused,though (I always found myself wondering in this movie who'd shotwho and why, who was running where and why).As usual the best thing about the movie is Weaver's performance. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I have no trouble believing thatRipley would refuse to be confined to the infirmary and take herchances around the prisoners.  By this time, she's faced the alienstwice--what has she got to fear from some puny double-y's?  Eachfilm in the series sees her get tougher and tougher, but it's abelievable transformation.  In the first two movies she was scaredbut smart;  here she's lost so much that she has no energy to bescared. All in all, it's not a perfect film, but it's not bad, either.",7,0,2,28 July 2001
Alien: Resurrection," Was it everything you'd hoped for?
","**includes spoilers**I disagree with those of my fellow reviewers who say that this filmwas just a gratuitous cash-in with no logical basis in the earlierfilms.  It may indeed have been just a gratuitous cash-in, just like 2& 3 were cash-ins on the first one, and the first one was a cash-inon the post-Star Wars sci-fi boom.  But I found the premise notonly believable, but inevitable in the same way as the first three.That is, if the scientific developments of the last few years (secretcloning projects, creating embryos for the express purpose ofharvesting stem  cells, etc.) have taught us anything, it's that ifscience can do something, it will.  Given the Company's scientists'determination to get a specimen of the alien in the first threemovies, you have to know that if there was any way to reconstituteRipley and get the queen from inside her, they would.  You knowthis would happen.  You know that somewhere, some scientist(some government) would do this, no matter the consequences.
That's what the whole series had been about, so in a sense it wasinevitable that at some point the series would have to show thescientists actually trying to breed the alien.  In a sense, the wholeseries has been building to this.You can see it in Ripley's eyes.  Sigourney Weaver gives astunning performance in this film, showing us not only the effectsof the alien genes she now carries, but an utter disgust anddespair at what humanity has done.  Early on, you can tell thatRipley has just given up on humanity--the coldness she displaystoward the victims of the alien could stem from her alien half, orsimply from this disgust.  Certainly the soldiers and scientistsdeserved what they got.It's this odd mixture of feelings, I think, that makes the scene withRipleys 1-7 so powerful.  Ripley 8, and the viewer, is filled withhorror at the degradations human inquisitiveness is capable ofproducing, and pity for the victims of that inquisitiveness.  Ripleyherself is perhaps the greatest victim.That doesn't make it a perfect movie.  I agree with the reviewer whosaid that it hews closest to the formula of the second movie, whichin this case means lots of action and virtually no characterdevelopment.  Like Aliens, everybody in this movie except Ripleybasically exists either to kill or get killed;  and whereas Aliens atleast had the little girl to inject some real pathos into theproceedings, in this movie there's nobody to care about except forRipley herself.  We're supposed to care about Winona Ryder'scharacter, the robot girl, but somehow the character doesn't quitework.  Ryder just doesn't have the screen presence, the intensity,to make herself felt over the explosions.  (I tend to think she'soverrated as an actress anyway.)I also agree that in showing so much gore, the movie diminishesthe impact of the creatures.  The key to the first one was that youonly saw the aliens for seconds at a time, and you never got areally good view--they were always hiding behind something, or ina dim corner.  That's why they were so scary.  In this movie, yousee absolutely everything, and the result isn't so much scary asjust gross.  The newborn is a cool design--a misshapen human/ alien cross--but we just see too much of it.  The first one was ahorror movie;  this is a splatter movie.So I give this one high marks for concept and for Weaver (andmaybe for the look), and low marks for just about everything else.",7,1,1,28 July 2001
The Godfather: Part III," not a sequel
","**Warning:  contains spoilers.**I don't consider Godfather 3 to be a sequel except in the strict, literal sense of the word:  it came after the earlier movie.  In the pejorative sense in which the word is usually used of movies--i.e., something that was thought up later to cash in on the success of the first one--this is definitely not a sequel.Godfather 3 is, instead, just what it says it is:  part three of a single, unified story.I see the Godfather trilogy--stay with me now, stop rolling your eyes--as a tragedy along Greek or Elizabethan lines.  Remember how they taught you in high school about the structure of the Elizabethan 5-act tragedy?  The climax was in the third act, in the sense that in the middle the tragic hero did something that sealed his fate, and everything after that was just the relentless playing out of the consequences of that single deed.Looked at in this way, Michael Corleone is the tragic hero of the Godfather movies.  And as a tragic hero he's up there with the best of them--just as archetypal in his own way as Oedipus or Hamlet.Michael is the man who can't live down his heritage, the man who can't escape his upbringing, or, ultimately, himself.  Like all good tragic heroes, he has enough potential for good to make him a sympathetic figure--he wanted so badly to get out;  even in part three, decades into a life of crime, Michael can make you believe he has always wanted out.  But it's his own weaknesses, his own ambition--his own virtue, in a way--that ruins him.His tragic act, the one which sealed his fate, was (SPOILER) ordering Fredo's death at the end of part two.  One might say that it came earlier, with the kiss of death he gave Fredo in Havana ('I know it was you, Fredo'), but still, up until the point that he actually ordered the execution, Michael could have turned back.  But after that point, his own fate was sealed.  He had destroyed, symbolically, the very thing that he had been fighting to protect all his life:  his family.So why make part three?  Isn't this all understood at the end of part two?Coppola had to make part three for the same reason the Elizabethans had to write the last two acts of their tragedies:  the cathartic, morally instructive, and dramatically satisfying part was in watching what came after the turning point.  You know, in act three, that the hero is doomed, but you have to watch his doom played out.  That's emotionally satisfying, it's morally necessary, it's artistically beautiful.And that's what Godfather Part III is all about.  You know, if you paid attention to part two, that Michael is not going to live happily ever after. He can't: in the moral universe of the movie, but more importantly in the moral universe he has created for himself, he has committed an unforgivable sin, and he must pay.  But he doesn't know it yet:  being human, he can always convince himself that he'll be able to escape culpability for his actions--until, that is, his guilt is driven home to him.Thus, when critics complain that Godfather 3 is anticlimactic, they're more right than they realize--it's not the climax of the trilogy.  It's the long, tragically necessary playing-out of Michael's doom.We know how it will end, thematically at least:  but there's great beauty and pathos in watching Michael be utterly destroyed.  We watch his grandiose plans to save the Church!), knowing all the time that his hopes are in vain. He cannot be forgiven.  Just like the cardinal his confessor says (SPOILER): he could be forgiven, but he himself does not believe it.  This is great tragedy, folks.  It's entirely appropriate that the last third of the movie be acted out to the backdrop of an opera, because that's what this is.And this is how the movie's climactic scene should be seen.(SPOILER)  When Michael's daughter is killed, he suddenly loses that which is most precious to him--and he realizes, you can see it in his eyes, that it's all his fault.  This is a divine retribution upon him for killing Fredo.  He wanted to protect his family, and only ended up ensuring their destruction.  Michael's scream on the steps of the opera house is one of the great cathartic moments in movie history--moves me to tears every time I see it.  You can just see the man's whole life melt there into one sustained cry of anguish.  (A brilliant stroke of Coppola's directorial brush, the decision to make the first breath of his scream silent, only music-- it makes it that much more intense, and private.)Performances:  uniformly excellent.  Pacino's style, in the intervening fifteen years, had become much more demonstrative, but it fits the character, as the steely control of the young Michael Corleone relaxes into the benign self-confidence of the older man.Diane Keaton, as she did before, gives unbelievable depth to what is still a fairly minor role--somehow managing to conjure up the entire non-Sicilian world in the single character of Kaye.  Andy Garcia is fantastic as Sonny's son.  Everybody, in fact, gives perfectly nuanced performances, except, of course, poor Sophia, and hers is the most important role!Perfect conclusion to the best movie ever made.  10/10",10,1,2,2 July 2001
Bram Stoker's Dracula," It's a Coppola film.
","Perhaps Coppola's true genius lies in his ability to totally mold his style to his subject matter.  With some directors, no matter what the film you always know you're watching a film by that director-- Woody Allen comes to mind, or even Martin Scorsese, most of the time.  Quentin Tarantino or Oliver Stone, definitely.  With Coppola, and it's going to sound strange to say this about a director with such an outsize personality--Coppola always submerges his personal style in the story he's telling.  Maybe a better way to put it is that his personal style consists in reinventing his approach with every story.That's why, for me, even his less popular movies are interesting: each film, from One From The Heart to Rumble Fish to Gardens of Stone, creates a completely unique mood, extending to every detail of set design and cinematography.  The man has perhaps the greatest range of any modern director--and exhibit A would have to be this:  that the same man that gave us the incredibly subdued, tight Rainmaker a few years ago had only five or six years before that made Dracula, as over-the-top a film as you can imagine. And it works.  Brilliantly.  The lavish sets and costumes (courtesy of Eiko Ishioka) are only the most visible of the effects Coppola creates in this movie.  Just as important is the way he puts together the narrative--all those elaborate transitions, the image overlays, the diary and letter readings.  They all contribute to creating a slightly stilted, starched-collar, almost operatic atmosphere that perfectly suits the material.  In this respect, I find Keanu Reeves's limitations as an actor working in the interests of the material for once:  his stiffness actually contributes to his character's believability.  It's easy to see why Mina would prefer Vlad to him.Coppola's respect for the material manifests itself in the technological subtext.  To a modern reader, 1897 feels like the ancient past, but Stoker's London audience was on the cutting edge of modernity--they must have felt just as much in control of their environment, on track to conquer the last mysteries of existence, as we do.  Coppola brilliantly succeeds in making new 'wonders' of the period such as the cinematograph and the typewriter seem thrillingly up-to-date, which just emphasizes the horror of this unnatural, unexplainable thing that has swept in from beyond the pale of civilization.  Note the heroes' pride when they believe that they can outrace the Count by taking the train, a recent innovation--and of course they fail.  Perfidy can always trump technology.Another master stroke is the way Coppola suggests a repressed erotic undercurrent to the straitlaced culture of the Victorian age.The briefly-glimpsed kiss between Lucy and Mina is a wonderful touch--is it erotic or completely innocent?  They probably don't know themselves.  Sadie Frost is fantastic in her role, managing to maintain this balance between innocence and wantonness all the way through, even as her character descends into horrifying depths.Performances:  uniformly excellent.  Anthony Hopkins is a hoot as Van Helsing--almost as creepy as Vlad himself, and a joy to watch.Winona Ryder gives perhaps her best performance as a woman who embodies the repressions of her age--she really doesn't seem to know which she wants, Vlad or Jonathan.  Rather, she seems to sincerely want both, alternately.And Gary Oldman is transcendant.  His performance is the romantic core that makes the movie work--we fully believe that he is evil and must be stopped, but at the same time we can truly sympathize with him.  Oldman makes us believe that Vlad's condition is a result of his love--he takes that motif from a mere plot enabler to the central, supporting element of the film.  A great performance (even if we can't understand what he's saying half the time!).The only reservation I have about the film is kind of hard to put my finger on.  It has something to do with the fact that _everything_ is there on screen--there aren't enough shadows, there isn't very much left unseen or unsaid.  In a sense that feels true to the conception of the film, a sort of old-fashioned aesthetic in which light and dark are clearly delineated, just as there's no confusion in Van Helsing's mind between his admiration for Vlad the man and his hatred of Dracula the monster.  A noir approach would have injected too much irony, too much cynicism in what is, finally, a very old-school sentimental, romantic story.  But having the monster waltz across the center of the screen in all his red-caped, white-bouffanted glory is a bit of a departure from the conventional image of evil lurking in shadows. Maybe a little disconcerting.Still, I give it 8 of 10.",8,0,1,1 July 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," I'm right here.
","First off, if you haven't seen the old movie Sullivan's Travels, try toscare up a copy before watching this.  There's a real connection,and being aware of it just makes your appreciation of this moviethat much deeper.This should have gotten the Oscar for Best Picture last year.  Andafter giving it to this film, they should have stopped giving it forabout ten years.  It's that good.I love everything the Coen brothers have done, but this filmtranscends.  It's the best film I've seen in years.  It just may be theGreat American Novel.  High school English teachers say HuckFinn is, but it was too early:  America hadn't happened yet.  Highschool English teachers say Huck Finn was based on theOdyssey just like this film is.It's very easy for me to wax mystical about this film.  It's a mysticalfilm.  By setting it in a mythical version of Mississippi--a land thatexists in its purest form in old country blues and protobluegrasssongs--the Coens have tapped into the motherlode, the jugularvein of American myth.  This is the real America--the absurdity, thecruelty, the violence, the beauty, the deceit, the Dapper Dan.  Thisis the best America--the America that gave birth to Robert Johnsonand the Carter family.  Critics used to say that the Coen brothers were technically brilliantand emotionally cold filmmakers.  I never understood that and I getit even less now:  this movie has more heart, more passion andlove and spirit, than just about anything else I can think of. 
Perfect performances (George Clooney gives us the ride of hislife), breathtakingly beautiful cinematography, and the bestsoundtrack maybe ever.  Mark Twain would be proud.  10/10",10,1,2,3 July 2001
