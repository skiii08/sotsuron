The Ring," A Scary, and INCREDIBLE movie
","I walked into this movie without even knowing what is was about, and about 5 minutes into it, I was in tears. This movie was so scary that it made me cry; however, unlike other scary movies form my days, this one was brilliantly written and directed.The story was so well-thought out and portrayed that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, it was so catchy. Everything wrapped up beautifully in the end, and I left the theater, and was terrifyed for 7 days.",Null,1,2,15 June 2003
