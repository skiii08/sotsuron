Walk the Line," Amazing
",Before I saw this movie I hardly knew who Johnny Cash was and now I am a Johnny Cash fanatic. Joaquin and Reese both deliver excellent performances and are believable as John and June. I have watched this movie about a dozen times and I have to say that every time I watch it I find that it seems to get better each time. Not only is the acting fabulous but the music adds to the believability of Joaquin and Reese as John and June. When I found out that Joaquin and Reese were going to sing I felt a little apprehensive about it but I think they have pretty good voices and I actually listen to the soundtrack regularly. If you haven't seen it I highly recommend it.,Null,1,2,29 June 2006
