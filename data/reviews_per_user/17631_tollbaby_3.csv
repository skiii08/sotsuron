Marie Antoinette," What the heck was Coppola doing???
","It amazes me that Sofia Coppola continues to have a career, despite her ineptitude. The historical inaccuracies are bad enough, but the bizarrely placed rock music makes this movie a farce. The film ends very abruptly, almost as if they had run out of film, and then the idiotic music starts up again. I honestly felt as though I had wasted two hours of my life watching this film. Kirsten Dunst is as wooden as ever, and Jason Schwartzman, although handsome, is completely wasted in this dud. Someone should take away Sofia Coppola's camera. Her daddy didn't teach her well enough, and she has no business making movies.",2,0,1,8 May 2015
Seven Years in Tibet," Very good, but extremely long movie!!
","I think the editors were afraid to cut on this one - as far as I'm concerned, the film did not justify the budget... way too long, many scenes and side-tracking plot lines could have been done without. Brad Pitt was okay - by no means fantastic, but not bad either. His accent was a little uneven and at times he lost it completely. The only really incredible performance in the film was by the young Dalai Lama - just fantastic!
By the end of the film, I felt sort of cheated, but there were some really good moments - obviously a Brad Pitt vehicle though. Disappointing.",Null,0,1,27 August 2002
Mission: Impossible II," Better than the first
","I read the previous (scathing) review, and I felt that it was unfair.  I thought that MI2 was much better than the first movie, and didn't make you come out of it saying 'what the hell was THAT?' the way the first one did (with me at least).  Nice action sequences by John Woo (but the car crash sequence was a TAD overdone - I got so confused).  Thandie Newton seems to have been added to provide her sexy smile (which is about all she did). Her acting skills were severely underused in this role, but hey, it's an action flick! Cruise and Scott (Dougray Scott, the villain) gave really good performances (not the best of either career).  I think it's interesting that no one has noticed William Mapother yet (some relative of Cruise's) - he's worked in and on many of Cruise's films, and I think it would be worth finding out just what the relation is :) All in all, I'd buy a copy and I'm sorry we missed it on the big screen!  Great soundtrack, toned-down Woo, good action :) I liked it (and I started the movie thinking I'd hate it!)",Null,0,0,1 January 2001
