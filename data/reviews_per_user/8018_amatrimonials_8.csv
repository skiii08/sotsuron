Source Code," Excellent premise, irritating execution
","The underlying premise is really interesting, but the materialization is at a few points in the movie annoying to the point of being excruciating.We have a soldier in the U.S.A.F. who finds himself in an inexplicable and highly perturbing situation. Yet, it is explained to him in no uncertain terms the critical nature of his mission. Hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands of lives depend on him efficiently and methodically finding a bomber and possibly thwarting his/her nefarious designs.Instead, the guy goes off-track on silly 'side-missions' (finding out what had happened to his real self, or Frenching his leggy companion on the train), and engages in interminable dialogs with mission control.Nevertheless, the beginning and especially the end are superbly done. It is poignant without being schmaltzy and cheap. This is the first movie in quite a while I can gladly recommend.For those of us interested in quantum physics, watching this was a boon. For the rest, look up the Schroedinger's cat story; it will give you a new perspective on this picture.",8,0,0,30 December 2013
Deja Vu," The most apposite movie title EVER!
","Deja vu indeed. Already seen. Over. And over. And over.And over.It was a pretty interesting flick until around the middle: the point at which the indomitable Denzel decides to go back in time. It had to happen though. I mean, without his going back in time, we'd have had a movie where he didn't French a broad, and that just simply wouldn't do!So, notwithstanding a solid first half, how is this movie idiotic? Let me count the ways:* Though sending living organisms through the 'wormhole' had been tried before with disastrous, yea lethal, consequences, Denzel pulls it off with nary a cardiac arrest.* Denzel then strolls out of the hospital a few hours after said cardiac arrest (I'd like to see the fittest of patients do that in real life!) and proceeds to perform high-speed driving stunts to boot.* The obligatory damsel in distress had been kidnapped, blindfolded, had gasoline poured all over her, witnessed a massive close-proximity explosion and a gun battle. That would permanently traumatize to the point of delirium all but the most stoic and hardened of soldiers, never mind an innocent yuppie. Yet, literally 10-15 minutes later she's pulling a gun on Denzel, in total control of the situation, and then joins him in hatching up a daring and cunning plan.* We get to see Denzel's chiseled torso. Yay.* We get to witness a spark between Denzel and the damsel, set to schmaltzy muzak. (All the while, remember, the bomb is ticking away!) I guess it was meant to be a poignant 'Aaaawww' moment, but it was so contrived and jaded that I just laughed. Such drek has the effect of lowering my impression of a movie by 20% right there. Here's a clue for ya, Hollywood: Real people don't fall in love while cleaning each other's gunshot wounds barely a half hour after they first meet. Take a few lessons from Bollywood about how to present a believable and moving romance.* The terrorist's motivation is never really discovered or disclosed, nor are his cause and affiliations. Yet, he - a lone, homegrown, wolf - manages to drive an S.U.V. without license plates and with a bomb the size of a barrel onto a ferry with hundreds of military personnel on board. Yeah. Right.* Upon realizing something was amiss with her beau's original plan, the heroine jumps onto the ferry from the shore. Nobody, apparently, detects that. One wonders why anyone bothers buying a ticket to go on a ferry if it's that easy to get on board for free.* The terrorist DOES make her though, but - whaddaya know - does NOT kill her! Instead, he tapes her mouth and locks her in a car. In the driver's seat. *double facepalm** The terrorist does, however, kill without a how do you do at least a half dozen heavily-armed servicemen wearing flak jackets, in addition to a few guards.* With bullets flying nineteen to a dozen on the lower deck, the seamen and other personnel crowd the upper decks, literally falling over themselves, to observe the spectacle.* The heroine starts up the vehicle whose steering wheel she was conveniently placed behind, and at the pivotal moment drives into the terrorist.* Several armed agents empty their magazines into the runaway vehicle with a massive bomb in it. But. Do. Not. Hit. The. Bomb.* Denzel dies. *bawl* But two minutes later another Denzel comes along. *whoop* The two ride off into the sunset... - or some such. *a tear*Give me a fracking break.And I don't mean 'fracking.'The thing is, Denzel Washington is actually a good actor, and I like him a lot. He is one of the few able to deliver his lines in a way that sounds totally spontaneous, almost as if ad libbing. This guano was beneath him; if I was him, I'd keep it off my Resume.",4,0,2,24 March 2014
Lone Survivor," Accurate, schmaccurate
","Some have cast doubts on the verisimilitude of parts of this picture. Of course, those who impugn whether some events really happened or whether they happened the way they are depicted in the movie neither underwent the kind of training Navy S.E.A.Ls do nor did they ever find themselves in circumstances remotely approaching those of the four comrades. We do not know what punishment the human body is truly capable of withstanding until we are put to an extreme test, gods forbid.All I can say is that, regardless of whether this movie is accurate 100%, 0% or anything in between, it brought me to tears. I can honestly not remember the last time a Hollywood movie did that.Very moving, very poignant, very touching. For that alone, as well as for keeping me riveted for the whole of two hours (which is quite a feat given my cynical and jaded nature), it deserves unalloyed plaudits.",10,93,166,29 March 2014
The Day After Tomorrow," Painfully clichéd, annoyingly predictable
","The premise of the movie is somewhat interesting if totally unrealistic. It showcases some sweet special effects. It... - hm, no, that's about it as far as the positive.The negative? It's deja vu to the point of pathetic and beyond.An everyday Joe-turned-superhero? Check.Joe's dysfunctional family brought to reconciliation thru a disaster? Check.Joe's precocious multitalented kid? Check.Joe's kid's cute floozy, also boasting nigh-on preternatural abilities (except when she has to play the damsel in distress for Joe's kid to save)? Check.Politically correct side-characters (e.g. the African American hobo with the intellect of an Ivy League chaired professor)? Check.Intransigent, maladroit, aggressively stubborn politicians (American, of course)? Check.Barely 20 minutes into the movie I was rooting for them to perish. Now, THAT, would have been a movie!",3,0,3,13 February 2011
2012," Special effects - great; everything else - should carry a serious health warning
","*sigh* Painful. Excruciatingly painful. Stupid, trite, clichéd, cheesy, corny, predictable, platitudinous, illogical, shallow. Other than some awesome special effects and computer-generated scenes of apocalyptic devastation, this movie is a two-and-a-half-hour abomination. An abortion of talent, intellect, mental stimulation... It's so dumb that it cannot even constitute mindless (literally!) entertainment. You know those movies that are so pathetically fatuous that you end up cheering for the bad guy (or, in this case, willing the 'good guys' to all be obliterated)? This is one such instance, par excellence.It was only the cuddly company off whom I could bounce my searingly cynical comments that prevented me incurring brain hemorrhage about a half hour into it.If you have the slightest temptation to watch it, don't. Give it a WIIIIIIIIDE berth.",1,6,8,3 July 2010
Friends with Benefits," H-A-T-E the 'music'
","Aight, the picture itself is not too bad. It's clichéd, shallow, crude, predictable. It's replete with impossibly talented non-entities cracking wise left and right. Both women and men, gay and straight, are portrayed as annoying jerks, without any old-school values or integrity. If the human race ever devolves to the specimens as depicted in this movie, I'm getting a one-way ticket off the planet.All that, however, can be glossed over.What REALLY got to me, and which got me to write this feedback is the supremely irritating muzak. I mean, literally EVERY SINGLE scene concludes with a score, and each and every score is basically some schmuck banging on a guitar and intoning nondescript, forgettable words. It's the kind of thing that passes for 'profound' in a hippie commune with everyone stoned and half-comatose. I don't know what genre it officially is... - 'indie,' is it? I know the said 'music' is meant to give pause for thought, reflection, to make us pensive... - but it's just imbecilic and bland. It totally lacks any character. Jeez Alou, you could literally replace all the so-called lyrics with 'nya nya nya' in the style of someone who takes a break from drooling into a cup, and the effect would be identical.Anyway, so the O.S.T. entirely ruined for me what would otherwise have been a 5/10 feature.",1,17,31,19 June 2012
Invictus," 'Predictable,' 'forgettable,' 'inaccurate'...
","Those are some of the criticisms leveled at the movie.Forgettable? I don't think so. I rewatched this picture three times in the space of eight or so months, and am sure to do so again. I love politics and anthropology, and this movie goes a decent way toward depicting the transition-South-African psyche and events.Inaccurate? Maybe. But, then, this is not supposed to be a documentary. For dead-on accurate features one usually goes to the History Channel.Predictable. Aside from a few tense moments, yes.However, none of the above detracts in any way from this movie. It is interesting, fast-moving, does not contain gratuitous violence or sex or C.G.I. It is thoughtful and thought-provoking. It is also very poignant. Though not a fan of the A.N.C. and having reservations about Mr. Mandela himself, I have no shame in admitting I was moved to tears a number of times. Pres. Mandela is rightly portrayed as a statesman and a mensch who averted disaster and bloodshed upon the dismantling of the reprehensible Apartheid regime.The message conveyed through this picture gives hope, particularly to those of us in the Middle East. If the bitter enemies of decades of turbulent strife can get along, there might be hope for us yet, too!P.S. The musical score is also excellent!",10,2,3,10 December 2012
Law Abiding Citizen," Yes, the ending sucks, but...
","...I'd rather have 90 minutes of great movie and 13 minutes of a disappointing conclusion than vice-versa.The introduction and body of the movie are fantastic, full of drama, suspense, and a continuous emotional roller-coaster.As many, I wasn't happy with the ending. But, then, how was it ever going to end anyway? The protagonist could either have met his death or he'd have been sentenced to multiple, consecutive life sentences. He was never going to be released, that's for sure. So, given those choices, the first wasn't such a bad one.More disappointing is that the protagonist is turned into the 'bad guy' toward the end, even though I personally didn't buy it. He may have gotten a bit carried away with his attempt to blow up the mayoral conference, but I'd say his heart was in the right place.In any event, the movie, including the finale, got us all talking. Isn't that a hallmark of a good picture?",9,1,2,27 October 2012
