Catch Me If You Can," Witty, entertaining and hilarious
","Right from the opening credits, I knew that this was going to be an entertaining movie, and it was. This movie was witty and hilarious at times, and with sharp writing and non-stop action, it really delivers this story, which is inspired by one in real life, well.The story is about Frank Abagnale Jr., played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who is a very intelligent 16-year-old who runs away from home and starts pretending to be a co-pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, and succeeds in the meantime to steal millions of dollars using payroll checks. All this is, of course, not without consequences, and he soon has an FBI agent, Carl Hanratty, played by Tom Hanks, on his tail. And even though the two characters are rivals, you see throughout the movie a growing relationship between the two during the scenes they share together.The director of this movie, Steven Spielberg, is known for his epic Hollywood films, but this one feels a bit different and is a lot more lightweight, but still very interesting and at times powerful. There are scenes where Frank and his father, played by Christopher Walken, get pretty tense while they have conversations. The father-son relationship really made this movie a lot more interesting for me.All the actors did really great jobs here, DiCaprio was perfect for the role, Walken delivered a moving performance, and Tom Hanks was unsurprisingly terrific. Amy Adams, who I haven't mentioned was in this, was also great. As I said, all the actors were just great, and there's not much more to add to that.All in all, a solid, entertaining movie. If you're looking for something easy to watch, something funny, I could definitely recommend this one.",8,2,3,1 November 2019
The Revenant," Brutally beautiful
","'The Revenant' is directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu, and it is a true story set in the 1820s about a man named Hugh Glass, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. The movie is about how Glass gets abandoned by his partners in the middle of the woods, severely injured, and how he throughout the entire movie, seeks revenge on the people who were responsible for abandoning him. That's about as much as I can say without spoiling too much.This movie was absolutely brutal, there were fight scenes that got me clenching to my seat in suspense, especially the climax of the movie. This movie was also extremely harrowing and emotional, and even more so when you know that it is based on a true story. There were rarely any happy moments or nicer moments where you could pause and relax because Glass' journey was not an easy one, it felt like nature was almost constantly against him.The acting in this movie was incredible, and it is also the movie where DiCaprio finally wins an Oscar, and he truly deserves it. His character is a man with few words, but the acting really shines with his body movement and facial expressions. Tom Hardy plays the antagonist, John Fitzgerald, and, though this isn't the best performance he has given, he does a great job here.Now let's talk about the cinematography. I'm immensely impressed by how beautiful this movie is. There were shots from this movie that I couldn't stop staring at, I was perplexed by how amazing everything looked. And the score for this movie also really emphasized the brilliance of the visuals. The moving camera and long shots that were frequently used were also impressive, and it really makes you feel like your running around with everybody else during the battle scenes. The CGI used in this movie was also incredible, at one point the movie features a bear, and it looks absolutely photorealistic.The only problem that I have with this movie is that the flashback scenes feel a bit confusing and messy, and sometimes the movie can feel a little boring, also due to its long runtime. But otherwise, this movie was superb and definitely worth the watch.",9,1,1,10 February 2020
The Shining," A timeless masterpiece.
","An unforgettable cinematic delight that puts you on the edge of your seat and haunts you with it's ominous music. Superb acting from Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall, and incredible directing from Kubrick, this is truly one of the best horror movies of all time.",10,5,8,31 May 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Underwhelmed, but not bad at all
","Going into this movie, I had high expectations. The amount of hype this movie got upon release, the positive critic reviews, and my friends praises towards it already made me wonder how good this movie could really be, and then I saw that it won an Oscar, a Golden Globe, and a BAFTA award. So yeah, as I said, I had high expectations. And I'm not gonna lie, I was slightly underwhelmed.From what I saw in the trailer, movie posters, and from what I heard from friends, I knew that this was going to be a really visually stunning movie. And it was. The visuals were easily the best thing about this movie, they were not only masterfully created, but set the perfect theme for the movie. They really made me feel like I was watching a comic book that was magically turned into a movie, and I'm so glad that this isn't just another boring 3D animated movie.Now for the story. It's essentially about a handful of differently themed Spider-Mans, who have to get back to their own dimensions, except for one of them, our main character. Their obstacle, the movie's antagonist, is a giant man, called Kingpin, who lost his family in a car accident. Kingpin wants to get his family back using a huge machine, which will doom the entire planet if he uses it. And I don't want to say more, otherwise I'll spoil it, but I'll still talk about my opinions. I think the introduction of new Spider-Men, or Spider-People, is really fun and creative, and I think that Kingpin is a fantastic, honestly scary, villain. But what I don't like is the way they have to stop Kingpin: they just have to press a button on the machine, then they save the world. It's awfully simple, I don't think I have to explain how silly it is, and why I dislike it. If there was a more complex goal, this movie would've probably been a lot better.Now that the most important topics are out of the way, I'm gonna address the comedy in this movie. There are a few laughs, some flat jokes, but what I'm happy with is how the comedy isn't distracting at all, except for one time, with Spider-Ham, in the climax of the movie, but that was a pretty good joke, not gonna lie.The music is pretty solid, using hip-hop was a good choice, as it really gave the movie a good flow and tempo. There's not much else to be said about it, other than my opinion, which is that some of the songs were fairly good.I'm gonna finish this review by saying that I hoped to watch a movie I could at least give a 9/10, but was a little disappointed. Nevertheless, it was still a solid, good movie, and I didn't waste my time at all. Would recommend to people who ask.",8,2,2,28 September 2019
Joker," Disturbing and different, in the best possible way
","I tried to lower my expectations before watching this movie, with little success. But when I left the cinemas this evening, I was still in awe at how good this movie was. 'Joker' was one of the most anticipated movies of this year, and it certainly lives up to the hype, and exceeds my expectations by miles.As good as this movie was, 'Joker' was a tough movie to sit through. It was very disturbing at times, because you never knew when the main character, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), was going to...break. Right from the start, it is made perfectly clear that this guy is not normal at all, in fact we are told that he was a psychopath, and that he used to be locked up because of that. And as we see Arthur do his everyday routine, we also see how weird, abnormal, and sometimes even frightening, he is. And so that puts you on the edge of your seat, waiting for him to go fully berserk, and that made this movie an extremely intense and rough watch.Despite this movie being about a superhero franchise villain, it doesn't really feel like that. For one reason, that is because this Joker doesn't look like any Joker we've seen before, because this is an original take on the Joker's backstory. But for another reason, it is because it's really just a movie about a guy who doesn't fit into social norms, and how he gets treated terribly because of that. 'Joker' isn't a typical blockbuster movie, it's a lot deeper and meaningful than that.The movie's soundtrack is great, it really makes us feel like we're trapped in this psychotic box with the main character, and it gives you an uneasy feeling. The acting from everyone is great, and Joaquin Phoenix delivers yet another Oscar-worthy performance. The cinematography and editing both suit this movie extremely well, they give it depth and, as I said, doesn't make the movie feel like yet another blockbuster superhero movie. Todd Philips proves himself to be a talented director after all, and I'm looking forward to seeing what more he can do in the future.Watch this movie in the cinemas while you can, it's really the best movie-watching experience you can get, and 'Joker' really deserves that, and you do too.",9,1,1,6 October 2019
The Matrix," 20 years later, still one of the best movies ever made
","What can be said about The Matrix that hasn't already been said? If you haven't watched this movie yet, you've probably heard a lot of people praise it before, and every bit of that praise is well deserved. This movie is one of my all-time favorites, and each time I watch it, it only gets better.You've probably also heard that this movie is mind-blowing, or mind-bending, or mind-boggling, or other words used to describe something crazy that starts with 'mind', and it is. This movie still makes me think days after I've watched it, and whenever it comes to mind I try to wrap my head around it, not because it's confusing, but because it's complex. After watching this movie you'll find yourself questioning reality and life as we know it, and what it really is.This movie one of my all-time favorites because...well just because it's top-notch filmmaking. The story, if I haven't made it clear yet, is amazing. The action and fight scenes are as flawless as flawless gets, not to mention the influential CGI usage (the bullet-time scenes). The acting is superb, Keanu Reeves did a wonderful performance, likewise Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and the rest of the cast. And the list goes on of the great things I could say about this movie, but I am not a fan of super long reviews, so I'm gonna end this before it becomes one, but not before I mention how good the soundtrack is...the soundtrack is really good.If you haven't watched this movie already, do yourself a favor and do so. Yes, I know that 'do yourself a favor' phrase is overused, but I'm gonna make an exception for The Matrix.",10,1,1,21 September 2019
