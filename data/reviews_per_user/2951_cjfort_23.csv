Alien 3," The Review Pt. III: Alien 3
","This is the movie that jumps so far from the original two movies that you wonder if it is the same movie.The movie begins pretty well (and a little disturbing), but turns into an action movie without a lot of action. But, then ends perfectly. The middle isn't as bad as it sounds. Don't listen to the others. It's a good movie, just not really an alien movie. It sorta fits, but the first two movies were connected by memories of the planet and stuff, but this one is connected with Bishop, the alien, and the people in the beginning.Good movie, but not classic good like the other two. Fourth i haven't seen...yet...THE JOURNEY CONTINUES! --J.AchE-- o0smile",5,0,3,28 June 2006
X-Men," The Beginning of All the Comic Book Movies of the 2000's
","This is the first movie based on a comic book in the 2000's. After this movie, movies such as Spiderman, The Hulk, Hellboy, and other movies based on comic books came out...oh, about three times a year. But, the good thing is that at least the whole obsession was started with such a great movie.This is a great movie full of action, and drama at every turn. Less action than you'd expect, it is a well made and scripted film. Only after seeing the second film will you notice how gray it feels. It is sorta 'one-track' if you know what i mean. But it is still a great movie.",9,0,0,16 June 2006
Cloverfield," The Review: Cloverfield
","Cloverfield could probably best be summed up as a breath of fresh air.Walking into Cloverfield, I had known about some of the hype, and had know about it for awhile (A relative was heavily into it), and I am happy to say it is as good, if not better than hoped.I do believe the hype has helped how good it is. If you followed everything, the film is much more real to you than someone knowing there was an explosion in the commercial. But if you didn't follow the hype, you can be sure it will still be a good movie.I would like to mention, though before I get into the hardcore part of my review, that A). I will not spoil the monster many have wandered about and B). Be weary of negative reviews, because after asking people, I've noticed, quite ironically, that the people who don't like it the most, are all in school, aka the people who are most hardcore about YouTube.Now, this movie has been most popularly called a mix between The Blaire Witch Project and Godzilla. Though there are heavy elements between Cloverfield and these films, that comparison isn't quite right.This movie is not a rip-off. It is more like an original movie made out of Unoriginal parts. The film does do the hand-held, first person point of view like Blaire Witch (which was the reason for many negative reviews, and for me warning you that if you have motion sickness, don't watch the film), but this movie doesn't screw up the premise. It uses it very well, and doesn't over do it, and puts our very funny comic relief behind the camera.The film is very intense throughout, and doesn't disappoint on it's monster. The monster is used like Jaws is used, only with a little more seeing, and this ends my talk of the monster.Another warning, is that you must know that this isn't played like a movie, or a documentary. It's played like a tape found after the incident nicknamed 'Cloverfield'.This movie won't have a formulaic (for the most part) story, so don't expect Hollywood endings or development, but more like real people in real situations. That is the main reason overall why people didn't like it, because they expected a Hollywood picture or '98 Godzilla. DON'T. THIS IS NOT THAT KIND OF FILM.Overall, the film was very exciting, realistic, and the characters aren't character's, but real people (to creep you out more, go to their Myspaces).I highly enjoyed this film, and protect it from haters. See it with a fresh mind.Rating: *** (of 4) Entertainment: PERFECT 5 (of 5)",10,2,5,23 January 2008
Alien," The Review: Alien
","Alien is a famous movie. Almost everyone has heard of it. Most of those who have seen it do not like it. It is a slow movie amplified by the lack of music. It is a good movie full of suspense and, yes, gore. It is a gory movie (though not compared to todays movies).A good movie, just for a different generation. Many from the generation we all know think Aliens is better; the sequel. That's because this one is the horror, that one's the action movie. It's still a good movie, but I like this one better.The first and second movies are the only movies that are classics, though three is good...ish. More like fun. I haven't seen the fourth yet, but i've seen vs. Predator, and it sucks. Stick with this one.",9,0,1,28 June 2006
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," The Review: Sweeney Todd: the Demon Barber of Fleet Street
","A dark and very bloody film by the entertaining Tim Burton, 'Sweeney Todd' not only delivers the goods story, acting, and direction/cinematography - wise, but also musically, like all good musicals should.'Sweeney Todd' isn't for everyone by a long shot, but it does have a lot for people to like. It has dark, or what surprisingly shows up in a moment that's dark, humor that always hits it's mark. It also has dazzling Gothic sets (even though Tim Burton has abused them heavily in his films, this time it just fit too well), and a dark story reminiscent of an Edgar Allen Poe novella, with great songs that any Musical lover could enjoy on one degree or another. Surprisingly, this fits well as a great musical, even next many classics.That's something to get to, also. There is more singing in this movie than most any other musical you'll see. with a whopping 95% of the movie sung, if you don't like musicals, chances are you'll dislike this pic, to say the least. But if you can get past that, you will thoroughly enjoy this film.One more thing to hit on is the gore. This is an extreme amount of gore, but it is colored in a bright red so it isn't realistic, but it serves its more metaphorical purpose.Over all, this film is musically epic, dramatically tragic, and well executed and highly recommended to anyone for at least on try, even if it doesn't look like your kind of film.Rating: ***1/2 (out of 4) Entertainment: ***** (out of 5)",10,1,3,7 January 2008
Nacho Libre," VERY Napoleon Dynamite
","In this film starring the brilliant Jack Black, a Mexican monk wants to be a luchador, but knows it's a sin, and plus he sucks.Funny movie with independent-movie-like-direction/cinematography is well done and has a good plan, but it was mostly done in Napoleon Dynamite.I didn't like Napoleon Dynamite, but still think it is a good movie. This movie was good, and I did like it, but not a whole lot. It was good, but all too familiar.(My cousin said the funniest part of the movie was the commercial for Cartoon Network with cheese from Foster's say he was a horse and say he pooted.) --J.AchE--",7,0,2,18 June 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," The Review: The Hills have Eyes
","Well.....it's a gory horror...okay review over.Well? Okay, here's your review.....IT's a gory, graphic movie, full of people getting things shoved into their heads, limbs, and (unfortanatley, and most disturbingly) a teenage girl's vagina. The direction was good and the music....but the writing and the things in it....too disturbing for me to put into words. Not a fan of this movie at all. Who rapes a teenager? For entertainment even! Avoid by all costs.(Review Based on Unrated Version....A Definite NC-17)",1,7,14,3 August 2006
Aliens," The Review Pt. II: Aliens
","(Part one is Alien)Aliens is the sequel to the classic by Ridley Scott. This movie is made by the great James Cameron. Though great, it doesn't mean he needs to. This case, he did great. This movie is a great classic, though a little far from the horror genre. It is more of an action movie with horrific moments. Every movie feels different though. Every movie in the series is a little different (the third took a giant leap), but for the most part they are good. This one is good, and probably the closest to feeling like it's a sequel to the first film. All the rest are completely out there (though good...ish.)J.AchE. o0",9,1,2,28 June 2006
Saw III," The Review: Saw III
","Here we go again: Jigsaw is back, does more torture.....and bores us to death with it.Dull story meets an even duller twist that was less a twist, but more a side note.The first was good, but that's where it should of ended. Now, we have sequels and rip-offs (not to mention a horrible new genre of horror)that do nothing but suffocate theaters with crap in place for real film.This heap of sh*t can go right back up the dog's ass it came from.Rating: * (of 4) Entertainment: negative ***** (of 5)",3,1,2,7 January 2008
The Usual Suspects," POOF! He's gone...
","Brilliantly made, directed, and written movie about criminals who meet in a line-up and decide to go on a crime spree for money. Very well scripted, and direction is very well done. Director Bryan Singer (X-men 1&2, Apt Pupil) has earned respect as a filmmaker by leading you into so many places only to put it all together to make one.One of my new favorite movies of all time is done so well, once you get into it, everyone around you won't matter. You won't even notice they are there. It is a must see, though slow at the beginning (for me, anyway; I was a little lost) and then like a roller-coaster of clues the next. I great mystery/thriller done to the fullest extent imaginable.Though, the R rating left out a few things: a scene of rape (very mild...ish) and for mild gore and drugs. Thge rest of the rating says language and violence. Lots of language said in colorful ways, and violence off and on. A must see overall.",8,3,6,16 June 2006
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," The Review: The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford
","This film was ignored. Don't get me wrong; I think the Academy picked some great picks for their nominations, but they screwed this picture. How did this not win Best Cinematography? How did this not get a Nom for anything else? How did Juno get a damn Nom over this? (Not that Juno is bad).'The Assassination of Jesse James' was a very exciting and moving film with beautiful cinematography, great acting, great script, and so much more. When the film starts out, it sets the tone immediately. The coloring; the music; everything about this film is all very well crafted to carry the movie to viewing bliss.The color of the movie is constantly a blue/gray, like an overcast; no sun showing through the clouds. To boost the look, a heavy yet light score is added with rumbling bass hitting in beat. The best example of this is the scene when they rob a train. Jesse feels the tracks for vibrations, and as the train comes into the view, and we see the light peaking in through the trees, all sound dies, and all we hear is the score.This film is great, and though it might not deserve winning Best Picture, it certainly deserved a nomination. Casey Affleck thoroughly deserved his nomination. He was very unsettling, and yet we felt bad for him, as we did with Jesse.The movie doesn't make you choose who the 'Good Guy' is to root for, because in a sense, no one is good, but no one is bad.This movie is highly recommended from me.Rating: ***1/2 (of 4) Entertainment: ***** (of 5)",10,3,8,15 March 2008
X-Men: The Last Stand," X1-9/10 X2-9/10 X3-8/10 and here's why...
","Though the movie was great, it still had it's little things that made it not as good as the other two.First of all, it didn't have as much character analysis as the others did. The first movie talked about all the main characters, the second more background on Wolverine and analysis on Nightcrawler, but this one had a lack of description on any of the new characters.Second, the movie didn't do well carrying all the character's. Some character's would go and do something and then you'd forget they where even in the movie at all before they ever got back into the film.But, this is still a great movie and worth watching. You won't regret the buying the ticket. It may still be different, but it is still worthy to be grouped with the other X-Men movies.",8,0,1,11 June 2006
Saw II," Torture could be better...
","I love the first film a lot, but the second didn't do it for me. I loved the background covered through the cops about Jigsaw, but the torture moments didn't thrill me as much as the first.The first one had me thinking and wondering about what should happen, what did happen, and what the characters should do about it. This one had a bunch of tricks that where creative and thrilling, but overall not as mentally interesting. They had basic bodies for the creation, with interesting aspects, but it was all very 'ooh, look at that! I think i'll puke now!' instead of in the first. You see, this one was 'trap, get out/die, move on to next trap'. the first was 'trap, try and find another way out, fail, take a step forward into getting out, etc.' This movie is worth watching, just not RE-watching.",4,2,3,11 June 2006
Saw," My Dad Screamed...
","My friend let me borrow this movie and the second one saying it was freaky and all that jazz, but he has a VERY different view on movies than I do. So, I was reluctant at first, but then my uncle also recommended it to me, and so me and my dad watched. My dad screamed and he hated the movie.If you didn't read the summary, this movie is about a killer who traps people in rooms or cellars and gives them a task in witch they have to do something that will cause them to inflict pain upon themselves. well, ruffly.I loved it. There are a lot of slasher-crap movies out there, but this is not one. It is a gruesome and disturbing movie, but it has a puzzle there that you think you know, but then find to be proved wrong. MOst people will not like it, like people with queasy stomaches, or if they like lot's of suspense (this movie does, just not a lot). It is well crafted and you should watch the movie AND watch it with commentary to find out how they came up with the idea.",7,0,1,7 June 2006
There Will Be Blood," The Review: There Will Be Blood
","There Will Be Blood is a very unusual film, be it the first thirty minutes with not a word spoken, or the twisted corruption of an oil man. This movie is less a popcorn movie and more an artistic piece of work that seems to express much more than you had first braced yourself for. My friends and fellow critics, this is a work of art.The beautiful cinematography is just one of the many feats this film has. Others include the amazing acting from Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano (Paul is absolutely frightening) to the intensity and language the script brings to the characters.This isn't going to be an easy film to sit through. This film is a journey into one man's soul, and watch it decay from the inside. Greed is the main subject for this film, and it expresses it with perfection.The name is a bit of a misnomer. There isn't much blood in this film. As a matter of fact, the film is a PG rating in Canada, so don't expect to see a graphically violent film.As I said before, the cinematography is beautiful. You'll hold your breath at the sight of 50 men running toward inflamed oil spurting out of the pump and into the air, making mid-day look like deep, moon-less night. This scene is just one of many.This was a very good contender for Best Pic. Only the masterpiece that is No Country for Old Men could have beaten this brutal, and yet poetic film about Greed, Hate, and self-destruction.Rating: **** (of 4)Entertainment: ***** (of 5)",10,4,8,3 May 2008
American Gangster," The Review: American Gangster
","The always brilliant Ridley Scott has given us yet another gem, but not a diamond.'American Gangster' starts out with a man being burned alive, and it goes well from there. That may sound like a bizarre way to start a review, but what I mean is that it starts very exiting.The movie delves deep into two parallel stories beautifully woven together , if not slightly overlengthed. Denzel Washington is great as usual, but he is even better as a bad guy. He has that great blend of bad guy and family man, while Russel Crow gives a great (but, not as good as good as Denzel's) performance to counter him.The film goes great throughout but never builds any emotion in you for the characters, so when emotion is called in for, the film kind of flattens a bit, but the film is still one of the best of the year.Rating: ***1/2 (of 4) Entertaining: ***** (of 5)",9,0,3,7 January 2008
The Shawshank Redemption," Get busy living, or get busy dying...
","This is one of my all time favorite movies. It's about a man who is sent to prison for killing his wife, only he claims he didn't do it. He then makes friends with the inmates.It is a long movie, but watching it, you wouldn't know. It feels like it was a few minutes long. As a plus, it doesn't even feel like a movie. The characters are so well played, you think someone was filming them for some reality show or something (cthe camera angles are amazing, no reality show-like parts like on Law and Order). This is a great movie, though not for all. It is a prison movie and has the cliché moments like the guards being cruel and things like that (everyone claiming to be innocent saying 'The lawyer F***ed me!') It has actually convinced millions all over the place not to commit suicide or to stop cutting themselves and even leaving violent husbands/wives. This is a movie Everyone should TRY and watch.Recommendations: The Green MileRoad to Perditon",9,0,0,12 June 2006
Scream," The Review: Scream
","This is another slasher flick, just like before, only this one has a twist: the killer is obsessed with horror movies. It is a horror, just not scary. Gory, just not scary. It is a fun movie, just not the best movie. I enjoy it, but don't expect a horror movie. Expect a fun movie. I now own the movie and watch it constantly. The Killer was done well. You think you know who it is, but once you get certain of who it is, the movie will violently prove you wrong. Wes Craven hasn't made another horror classic or anything, but it is a nice cult classic.WARNING: The second movie is 'ok' but not worth it. fun for a few viewings.The third isn't even worth looking at. Keep away from the cover. It is trying to seduce you! RUN! This has been my two scents. Thank you.",8,0,1,12 June 2006
X2: X-Men United," Surrpassing the First one cleanly
","The second installment in the X-men movies jumps ahead of the first and, in my opinion, all of the comic-based movies in the 2000's (see my review for X-men 1 for more details User:cjfort). This a fantastic movie introducing Nightcrawler, a blue man who can teleport. Great story meets great effects and writing. Direction is fantastic and so is the clear use of color. The first one is sorta gray if you compare it to this one. This one has more background than the first and is overall a better movie.I recommend this one, but you have to see the first one first, because this movie contains someone of the mentionings in the first, but gone farther. After seeing this one, go back and watch the first and try and catch all they talk about.(In every movie, Kittie (girl who walks through walls) is a different age in every movie and actress: X1-15, X2-12, X3-16)",9,0,0,16 June 2006
300," The Review: 300
","Yes, we know, it looks amazing. Yes, we want to see it.The commercials were, duh, dazzling, and so I finally gave in to them and saw it.OK, the movie was pretty good. It looked great, but there was a stupid and useless sex scene, predictable outcomes, and a couple clichÃ©s to add to the mix.But, by the end of the movie you feel real satisfaction. But I lost all respect for the Queen when she sold herself like a whore for politics. I wanted her dead, but my wish didn't come true.Overall, I guess I like it, but it could have been a hell of a lot better.",8,3,7,17 March 2007
Sin City," The Review: Sin City
","Sin City is based on the Graphic novel by Frank Miller and directed masterfully by Robert Rodriguez. The film twists different story lines together all in this horribly sin infested city where everything is full of the nastiest things imaginable.The film is, as I said, masterfully directed, but everything else doesn't live up to those standards. The film suffers from violence that goes extremely violent when it doesn't need to to make it's point, and the same goes for the sexual themes. The 'Sin' in 'Sin City' is just a tad bit over the top (that being said, it's over the top for an over the top movie). Also the dialog is reminiscent of old crime movies (kinda corny), but it works well for the movie...most of the time. Sometimes it feels right, sometimes it's very awkward.The acting and just about everything else is good (though, the stories sometimes get too dark). Overall, it's it's over the top style mixed with either OVER over the top material or unfitting dialog that seems to pull this movie down from the ranks of being really great, but is still a good film.Rating: *** (of 4) Entertainment: **** (of 5)",8,0,2,8 January 2008
Donnie Darko," The Review: Donnie Darko: a cult phenomenon
","This is an amazing movie filled with a unique script with even more unique ideas. The whole movie is about a boy who is going through therapy, having to take pills and such. One night, he's awoken by a six -foot tall bunny, who tells him the world will end unless Donnie decides to do what he says. Besides, the bunny saved his life. The whole movie is a little confusing, unless you see it as everything having a meaning. It makes you wonder how God feels. The movie is amazing, thought provoking, and makes you wonder about what matters. Not for all tastes, but for many. Before you judge it, pretend it's a good movie and watch again, you'll notice things you didn't before.Rating: *** (of 4)Entertainment: ***** (of 5)",8,1,3,12 July 2006
Goodfellas," The Review: Goodfellas
","An incredible movie by none other than Martin Scorsese is, as you would have to have guessed, this one. Though, not as good as the first two parts of the Godfather, still in that are. With amazing cast, story (based on true events), and direction makes a wonderful viewing experience.Though I do have a little bit of a thing for the string violence and intense situations, that doesn't necessarily mean this isn't enjoyable for everyone else. By the contrary! No, this can be enjoyed by anyone who doesn't mind:A). Violence (against wife, and others, resulting half the time in death). B). Drugs (in the last hour, but still...). C). language (and LOTS of it; the Trivia says the 'F' word is used 246 times).Other than THAT, it's not too bad. One of the best movies I've ever seen.Rating: **** (of 4)Entertainment: ***** (of 5)",10,0,0,3 October 2006
