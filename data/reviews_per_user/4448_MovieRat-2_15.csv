The Lobster," Intriguing premise.....depressingly disappointing
","(Very minor spoilers)Sometime late 2016, I happened across a trailer for this strange looking film starring Colin Farrell. At its very basic, it is the story of a guy who goes to a hotel and he must find love in 45 days or he will be transformed into the animal of his choice...in this case, a lobster. It was very strange and the trailer implied that it would be comedy of sorts (Dark humor, maybe?) set in a world similar to ours but yet very different. I missed it when it came out in theaters and I have only just watched it via Red Box.There was one glaring question as I watched this film and after it was done: how did this film get all this praise (3rd place at Cannes, and nominated for Best Screenplay at the Academy Awards)? To hear/read the accolades and to listen to the cast and crew reminisce on how beautiful and thought provoking this film was...made me wonder if I am just not in tune with 'true art'. Maybe my rational brain is incapable of absorbing the nuances of the director's soft yet firm take on the love story. Yes, this supposedly a love story set to a dystopian dark comedy. A dark comedy it is not, not even the slightest snicker even dared to pass my lips the entire film. What did pass my lips was either a yawn or a demand for the film to 'get on with it!' and stop dragging it's feet.Here is the main problem: the majority of the film possessed absolutely zero emotion. The only time anyone even gave a hint of human emotion was when something painful/traumatizing occurred to a character. The rest of the time they spoke like Ben Stien after taking too many depressants. The actors said that if they gave any emotion it would detract from the beauty of the script...I'm sorry, when Shyamalan characters have more natural sounding dialogue than you then there is a serious problem. It also doesn't help that the majority of the cast don't speak English as a primary language...or that this is the first English language film by this director!And what about the love story? It is more a story about what is love or how you know you are in love. In this film and the setting...love is finding someone who has a similar distinguishing characteristic to you regardless of true feelings. You have a limp, I have a limp...we are a perfect match! Yes, the 'love' in this film is that absurd (not funny absurd, just depressingly sad absurd). And then you have the two societies in this film: the couples and the loners. The couples are the general population that forces everyone to strive toward partnership regardless of actual feelings. Concepts like individualism are oppressed and family is simply a product to help combat partner conflict. The loners are the ones living free in the woods to be individuals.....individuals that must live by the group's rules or suffer terrifying punishment on par with what the couples do. The film is absurd to the core. The characters are not at all realistic. The absurd dystopian society exists without rhyme or reason. The plot aimlessly drags on forever. And the ambiguously sudden ending left me shouting 'Thank God It's Over!' rather than 'No! I want to know what happened!' If you must see it, rent it for find a free copy. Spend as little money as you can on this 'film.'I give this film one steaming red lobster....straight into the trash can.",2,11,16,28 January 2017
The Ring," What the **** is this ****?
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I should have realized that this wasn't going to be a good filming experiance when I saw the Ring...the entire theater was filled to the brim with high school students with the front half of the theater being nothing but teenage girls.  Word of advice for all movie goers: NEVER SEE A HORROR MOVIE IN THIS CONDITION! I probably wouldn't have been so frightened by this film if the audiance didn't screem at the top of their lungs at every single little thing that happened on the screen.  But enough of that.The film itself was, unfortunately, was a typical mordern Hollywood horror film in that it relied on shock value to scare you. Fortunately, there was little to no gore involved in this shock treatment which was a plus.  What ever happened to the old days of horror films where building an atmosphere of terror was more important than shocking the audiance (like in this film when we are shown the end product of the Samara's wrath which is done suddenly without warning and is on screen for only a second).  And as I said before, if it weren't for the audiance (mostly highschool girls) screeming at every little thing the shocks in this film wouldn't have been so scary.**WARNING - SPOILERS AHEAD**But the worst and absolutely devistating thing about this film was the ending. I mean, the film would have been decent it actually stopped after they found the girls body and buried her. BUT NO! They had to go on, they had to have the girl coming out of the TV. They had to give the pointless solution to the curse by making a copy of the tape. I mean, this has to be the most pointless and idiotic ending I've ever seen in a horror film.Don't waste your time with this film! Go see something of more redeeming quality than this...like JACKASS: THE MOVIE. (yes, THE RING was that bad).",5,0,0,13 December 2002
Shakespeare in Love," Doubts at first, but....
","When I heard that Shakespeare in Love recieved the Oscar for Best Picture, I couldn't believe it.  How can something be better than Saving Private Ryan? But seeing that I never saw Shakespeare until just recently, I took it upon myself to find out if Skakespeare was truly better than Ryan.  By the end of the film, I was well assured that the Oscar went to the better film.  I loved Shakespeare. I laughed, I cried, and I found myself giving a little applause at the end.  Who ever did the casting did a superb job.  Not only could these people act in a film, but they could also do Shakespeare (which mind you is not very easy).  Not only was the film excellent but the performances of Romeo and Juliet that appeared throughout the film were the best that I have seen and probably will see.  Sadly, I could only give this film a 10 because the voting scale won't go high enough.  In my opinion the film deserves an 11.",10,6,12,17 April 1999
Public Enemies," Decent yet uninspired
","Sadly, the hype generated for this film and the chance to have Depp and Bale go at each other in a deadly game of cat and mouse fell short of the mark. Three things kept this film on a short leash, teasing the audience but never fully delivering.1) Camera work. I have noticed a trend in the film industry to film action with shaky, quick-cutting camera work. I understand it is intended to give the audience the same sense of chaos that the characters are feeling, but I find it distracting and just pure sloppiness. What was worse was that the 'shaky camera' was use throughout the film even when there was no action to speak of. I absolutely despise this 'style' (I use the term loosely) of camera work. Couldn't the studio have spent a few dollars more for a still camera set a vastly improve the quality of the film? Speaking of quality of film: 2) 'Digital film quality.' A film that is supposed to be set in the 1930's certainly lost its appeal when it feels like it was filmed with a digital camcorder. The 'digital' quality of the film made the movie feel unrealistic and out of place with the gritty world of the Great Depression.3) Lack of connection to characters. Given the last two problems I've discussed and adding to it the style of story telling, you feel absolutely no connection or sympathy for either Dillinger or Purvis. Its almost as if the director said, 'Here is Dillinger...here is Purvis...this happened...this happened....the end.' And this unemotional story is dragged out for over 2 hours.Sadly, it has the potential of being a great film but will ultimately become just another one of the hundreds of films that are released each year and will disappear into film history.",7,2,4,26 July 2009
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Have they gone 'too' far?
","I will grant you, this film is hillarious, but at the expense of making fun of every kind person imaginable (which is fair, no one is left out) and subjecting the audiance to a constant barrage of gratuitous language and extremely lude depictions of the human anatimy.  But by God this movie had everyone rolling in the aisles.But afte the film was done, I was left wondering...have Parker and Stone gone too far?I was an advid viewer of South Park before the film and when I found out that there was going to be movie I was hoping to find all the things that made South Park great...only more. Boy was I in for the biggest shock in my life.  My reaction to alot of scenes was basically the same as little Stan when he is confronted by a totally off the wall experiance, 'Dudes, this totally fu(beep)ed up.'If they took out the constant showing of certain parts of the male anatomy and gone a little bit easier on the language, I wouldn't have any problems with the film.  But for some reason I was left with almost the same feeling as I did when Stone and Parker made that South Park episode  totally devoted to Terrance and Phillip....it caused me to avoid South Park for a while. But now this movie has made me go on a sort of boycott of the show now.
It is funny, but it is a film that you would want to see.....only once (at most).But be forwarned: Very Very Strong language, repeated showing of nudity (both female...and male), extreme violence, and no-holds-barred, anything goes, racists jokes targeted at everyone (and I mean everyone, even white people).",7,1,2,6 October 1999
District 9," A 'documentary' sci-fi/horror film that works
","Films that follow the 'documentary' style of story telling, with its crude camera work and choppy editing, tend to fail miserably in creating a believable story (films like Cloverfield, which was supposed to be this great horror film but was pure trash and laughable)...District 9, thankfully, achieved and even surpassed the 'believability test.' For those who haven't seen it, over a million aliens have 'crashed landed' on earth in South Africa and are being 'isolated' in an area known as District 9. The 'documentary' follows a civilian NGO (non-goverment organization) member who is supervising the transfer of these aliens from District 9 to the up-to-date District 10. Needless to say, things do not go smoothly. Produced by Peter Jackson (who directed horror films before his Lord of the Rings fame) if this gives you any indication to the creepiness of the film...believe me, this film gets down right disturbing 1/4 of the way through and doesn't stop till the end.",9,0,2,26 September 2009
Zulu," (Singing) Men of Harlech....
","The Battle of Rorke's Drift...the mere name sends a ping of pride within the soul of every Englishman.  A battle where a mere 104 soldiers of the English 24 Regiment of Foot stood up against an incredible 4000 Zulu warriors at the mission station of Rorke's Drift in South Africa during the Zulu war. Throughout the film you are on the edge of your seat wondering: will the red coats be able to survive against this overwhelming force, or will they go down in a blaze of Glory as the Texans did at the Alamo.  You have plenty of time to wonder since 3/4 (or more) of this film is devoted to the battle itself.Now those who have seen the film often complain about the lack of realism concerning the way people died in this film. An example they would give would be when a soldier would only touch a Zulu with his bayonet and then the Zulu would fall over dead.  You must remember that this film was made during the 1960's, a time when the film industry frowned upon blood and guts flying everywhere during a war flick.  Films like Saving Private Ryan would never had made it to the theaters because of the realism.But one problem that I found with the film was the amount of historic liscense Hollywood took in the making of this film.  Many scenes which are depicted in the film never transpired in real life (based on my limited knowledge of studying the Battle itself).  But unless you have actually studied the battle you would have never guessed that parts of the film are fiction, they did that good of a job making the film.All and all, I loved the film and would reccomend it to anyone who enjoys a good war flick...or a good film.",8,1,3,25 April 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," CRY HAVOK! AND LET SLIP THE DOGS OF WAR!
","The war for Middle Earth has begun, and we are given just a glimpse of what is to come. You read that right, a glimpse. What you will see in The Two Towers is only a hint at the epic grandure of next year's film, Return of the King. But I'm not here to talk about what is to come, I am here to tell you about what is now...and that, my dear friends, is The Two Towers.Everything that was good about Fellowship of the Ring and everything that made it one of the best films of all time is right here in The Two Towers. Epic battle scenes...fantastic creatures/characters...internal and external conflict on multiple fronts...treachery...magic...comedy...love...there is so much about The Two Towers that can not be confined within the limits of this Commentary.  The Two Towers, like its predecessor, is very faithful to the written work of J.R.R. Tolkien; however, like Fellowship, this film does take a bit of artistic license to keep the audiance informed of what's happening in Middle Earth that Tolkien didn't mention in his Novel, and to keep the audiance engrossed and entertained for the near 3 hour film.  Yes, the 3 hour (actually 2 hrs and 59 min) seems a bit daunting, but believe me that by the time the film is over you will be wishing for more.  You will not be bored a single minute of the film. There is always something happening that will make you either cry, laugh (humor abounds in this film), or simply sit in you seat in complete and total awe.10 out of 10.  This film is definate Best Picture contender....gollum....",10,5,10,18 December 2002
The Da Vinci Code," Is this even the same story?
","I read the book a week before the movie and, despite serious objections to the falsely claimed 'facts' given by Dan Brown, I was drawn in by the engaging cat-and-mouse/treasure hunt story and wanted to see how this story can be adapted to the big screen. Despite the film's keeping to the basic storyline (search for the holy grail and its true meaning while evading multiple opposing forces) I left with the overwhelming sensation of 'what the heck did I just see?' Granted, one can never transfer all the minute details, exposition, dialog, or action that the book contains into a 2 hour film; however, there is a fine line between editing out certain parts and adding new parts that have absolutely no relevance or relationship to the original story. In the film version of 'The DaVinci Code', director Ron Howard not only crosses this line but leaps over it with reckless abandon. The pacing was all wrong, far too fast to develop any sense of tension (except the scenes where Silas physically attacks his adversaries). Character interaction in some cases were so different from the book that you are looking at a completely different person (see spoilers below). The ending was for the most part completely different (again see spoilers below). But despite all these changes, the overall film (standing on its own) was a serious let down in the entertainment factor. Bad pacing (as stated before), motivation of major characters changed unreasonably or were never explained, dialog seemed forced by some of the characters (Sofie and Langdon), and the ending just reeked of cheese.6 out of 10. Definitely no where near the quality of film that Howard or Hanks usually produce.********************************** SPOILERS **********************************This is mostly for those who have read the book. As I watched the film I couldn't help but cringe or scream (internally, wouldn't actually do it in the theater) 'HOWARD YOU *******' based on these blatant changes:1) Silas's eyes are blue in the film, not red as the book states.2) 'The Sacred Feminine' theory that is so blatant in the book is not as aggressively 'preached' in the film. A change that I actually found relieving. 3) Bishop Aringarosa, to put it bluntly, is not the same person. The book portrays him as a righteous priest duped by to find the Holy Grail in hopes of saving Opus Dei from being excommunicated and is horrified at what was done in the name of God. The movie, however, portrays him as a zealous member of a inner circle within the Vatican (no where mentioned in the book) who will do anything to destroy the Holy Grail including lying and murdering. 4)Fache's motivation for thinking Langdon is guilty is different. It starts off like the book, Sauniere left Langdon's name at the crime scene thus, in Fache's mind, Langdon is identified as the killer; however, later in the film we are told that Fache is after Langdon cause Aringarosa lied (as later revealed) that Langdon told the bishop he committed the murders in confession. 5) Fache and Aringarosa's relationship. The movie portrays Aringarosa as a manipulator like 'The Teacher' and pulls the strings of Fache's sense of faith and duty by framing Langdon. When the truth is revealed in the end, Aringarosa is unrepentant and still hell bent on his mission. The book is nothing like this. Why Howard decided to make a blatant change to the story is beyond me.6) Only one cryptex, the smaller one with the Issac Newton riddle, is kept in the film. Any reference to the larger (heavier) cryptex and the 'Sofie' riddle are completely gone.7) Langdon is approached by Collet at the lecture and not at his hotel room. Minor point, I know.8) Langdon and Sophie's trip to the Swiss Bank is on foot instead of by Taxi (they even added a scene of Sophie paying a guy to not take drugs). 9) Rosalyn Church is completely different than described in the book. Don't know if the movie shows the actual church or not. Furthermore, Langdon and Sophie actually go beneath the church and find Priory documents and evidence at the sarcophagus was present. No such event was in the book. 10) Major changes concerning Sophie's family: Sauniere was not her grandfather but acted as one after Sophie's family died to protect her; Sophie and her brother were in the car wreck and only she survived; as stated before, her brother is really dead; it was her parents that took her to Rosalyn church not her grandfather; she was scolded (rather harshly) by Sauniere because she was trying to find out what happened to her family (not because she snuck into his room and found the key). 11) Langdon figures out the rose line riddle all on his own with absolutely no help from Sophie's grandmother. 12) Sophie confronts Silas in the airplane. This scene didn't make any sense. Not the way Sophie acted, but how Silas talked to her which I felt was totally out of character.",6,0,3,20 May 2006
The Departed," A modern day Shakespearian tragedy
","If you didn't know any better, you would have thought that this story was written by Shakespeare. I mean it has everything: complex characters, heavy accents (Bostonian) that are near incomprehensible, plenty of language (oh yes, Shakespeare was quite vulgar for his time), sex, witty comedy relief, and an extremely high body count (along with gallons of blood). What starts as a simple undercover job turns into a deadly cat and mouse chase between the two rats (DiCaprio and Damon) to discover the identity of each other without getting killed in the process. Jack Nicholson is, as always, superb and delightfully evil as the vicious mob boss who, like everyone else in the film, has something big to hide other than the fact that he is a mobster. Minor roles of Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen almost steal the show with their off beat humor and sheer presence (respectively). Fair warning, this film has some very rough cursing and very graphic mob violence and is definitely not for anyone below 17. No nudity, surprising for a Scorsese film, but he makes it up with plenty of graphic sex talk (mostly from Nicholson). An excellent film.",9,0,0,14 October 2006
Psycho," True 'Horror'
","Just saw Psycho for the first time and I thought it was an excellent horror film.  Now those of you who haven't seen the original don't be confused or misled by the word 'horror.'  Most people today when they hear the word horror think of the likes of Jason or Freddy or Dracula hacking and biting people to a bloody pulp and leaving us with a very gross looking corpse on the the screen and a sick twisting feeling in our stomachs.  Horror, according to the dictionary, means a state of suspense or tension; unfortunately, today one can't call a movie a horror film without gore. When people today for the first time see Psycho think that this movie isn't scary enough or gory enough to be considered horror.   I must admit that I was at first trapped into that state of mind, but then I soon realized that Psycho is not a horror in the sense of gore or fright factor, but a horror in the sense that you are on the edge of your seat wanting to know what is going to happen and when it does happen you are shocked and sometimes disturbed by what has just occurred.What adds to the mystery, suspense, and yes horror to it all is the fact that you don't know how the movie is going to end; unfortunately, I found out what the ending was going to be before seeing the movie.  So I beg you all, don't tell others who haven't seen this film what the ending is going to be, because that is where I was the most scared in the entire movie. Just imagine what it would have been like if I, or anyone else, didn't know what the ending was.We miss you Alfred.",8,0,0,22 April 1999
The Sixth Sense," A true horror story
","In a time when horror films are steriotypically seen as gratuitous displays of gore and of monsters who repeatedly mutilate 'innocent' characters for no reason what-so-ever, The Sixth Sense decides to break the mold and return to the 'good old days' of the horror genre.This movie doesn't use gore or overused violence to play on the audiance's fear...instead it goes back to way horror films were done in the old days. The days when  Hitchkock was the master of horror.  This movie, beside the ghost who are depicted with their death wounds, is at heart one big mind game.  This movie is very very believable...which adds to the suspense that is already present.  This movie, unlike other horror movies, doesn't treat the audiance as mindless movie goers who are only interested in violence and blood; instead, it treats you as intelligent person and often makes you think about what is going on.  The acting was superb, the music well done (although at some points it did harken to the current horror style of increase intensity of music means something is about to happen), an excelent story, and of course the best ending ever to be shone on the silver screen.  The ending comes at you out of nowhere and you find yourself with your mouth dropping to the floor.
If you see the movie don't tell anyone who hasn't see it how the movie ends. Trust me.   Hitchkock had the right idea about telling people not to tell others about the ending of Psycho but when people started to tell others...the 'magic' so to speak died from the film.",10,0,0,4 October 1999
Heat," Complex, drawn out story with some action thrown in
","Technically the film was superb: realistic make-up; excellent use of lighting and filters; smooth and realistic sound...an A+ for the technical guru's behind this film. If you can stand the 3 hours long film just to bask in the glorious visuals and audios, you will have no regrets.The action in this film can only be described as a don't-blink-hold-your-breath-till-its-done tour de force. Each action sequence begins with a bang (literally) and ends with a bang. They are violent, terrifying, and yet beautiful to observe at the same time. A+ for the choreographers, stunt-men, and actors for giving us high octane action scenes that, without any doubt, stole the show.So why only a 7 out of 10? Two words....story and pacing. The story, in premise, has potential for being a great classic film of cat-and-mouse between a hardcore cop against a cold and determined crook. And yet we, the audience, are subjected to 3 hours of long, drawn out scenes mostly involving the mediocre lives of the two main characters. There are scenes in this film which in the grand scheme of things have absolutely no point what-so-ever in being in this film. Plot points that would have been taken care of in probably 5 minutes are drawn out in complex detail to the point of monotony. Now, in some cases, this approach works; however, for the vast majority of the film they are unnecessary and ruin the overall pace of the film. Mann, a veteran film-maker, should have known better. C for effort, but even that is generous in my book.I also felt the ambiguous morality of the film to be questionable. When the film nears its climax, you are still divided over who to cheer for: the cop or the crook. In a film that clearly shows that the cop, although flawed, is good and the crook, with 'some' redeeming qualities, is evil, the audience is left with an ambivalent attitude toward the fate of both. Once again, pacing is at fault. After 3 hours of feet dragging, you simply don't care about either of them anymore.",7,0,2,26 February 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Empire Strikes Back, And They Strike Back Hard
","Out of the four Star Wars films (Only Episodes 1,4,5,and 6 existed when this was written) I feel that this is the most philosophical of the group.  The scenes with Yoda and Luke remind me of those old kung fu movies with the wise, old master teaching the Art (or in this case the Ways of the Force) to his young and inexperienced disciple.   Those scenes and the battle between Luke and Darth Vader are pure classics.Despite this, I did not place this part at the top of my list of 'Best Star Wars Movie.'  After seeing Episode 4, where the underdog Rebels rise up against incredible odds to defeat the all powerful Empire in a beautifully done space battle, Episode 5 seemed to be sharp turn towards the opposite direction.  Han gets captured, frozen in carbonite, and transported to Jabba; the Empire beats the crap out of the Rebels time and time again; Luke gets his hand hacked off; and Darth Vader reveals that he is Luke's father. Totally different than the episode before it.Those who have seen the first one (Episode IV for those who don't know) and haven't seen the second one (Episode V) then I have just this to say...SHAME ON YOU!  But seriously, be wary.  It is not called, The Empire Strikes Back for nothing.",8,0,0,3 August 2000
Sin City," Masterpiece
","Films based on comic books (aka graphic novels) are often a hit or miss situation. There have been some great hits: Spider-Man, Batman, X-Men...and some notorious misses: The Punisher, Daredevil. Sin City, based off of Frank Miller's series of graphic novels, is not just a hit, it is without a doubt the best film adaptation of a comic ever. The story (or actually 4 different stories that are loosely connected by their shared setting) is captivating from the very start, filled with indomitable heroes, sympathetic anti-heroes, despicable villains, and one down right freaky Elijah Wood. The casting for this film employs a long list a stars and 'little' stars which, to my pleasant surprise, emboldens an already spectacular film. Visually, the film is so sleek, so unconventional, so comic bookish it is down right beautiful. You feel like you are actually inside the graphic novel and almost forget that this is a live-action film. More films should be done in black and white (with a little bit of spot-coloring for intensity).Bewarned, Sin City is not for the faint of heart. The film is filled with lots and lots of violence: a broken bone here, a decapitated head here, a dismembered victim here, an impaled head here, a guy punching another's face to a bloody pulp here...you get the idea. But, despite this, the violence is not 'gratuitous' but completely necessary for the film. There are also nudity in this film along with one sex scene. The language for the most part is imperceivable, you are so engulfed by the story and the violence that the language just doesn't register. The film also deals with issues that are completely not appropriate for young kids: cannibalism, vengeance by any means necessary (see the explanation on violence), molesting serial killers, and torture to name a few.The film is rated R for the above reasons mention and that warning should be heeded.A masterpiece through and through, an instant classic.",10,1,5,4 April 2005
