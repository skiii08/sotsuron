It," Impressed, better than original
",I'm really really surprised that I loved this adaptation more than the original movie. I've never read the book but I grew up on the 90s movie. This movie delivers.... it is a masterpiece of a horror movie. Wow. and it's not easy to creep me out or make me jump or just be scared. This movie did that and that is the definitive Pennywise,10,7,16,7 September 2017

","Why was this made, what was the point ? i feel like this is a movie they'd show to torture you at a POW camp",1,5,7,2 June 2019
