It," Not a worthy remake
","Not everything new is better. This isn't as scary as the old one, it's just 'flashier' with better CGI, etc. I can't say I enjoyed this for more than 10 minutes, whereas the original is still a good, faithful romp which more properly depicts the events in the book. Can no-one stand movies where suspense is implied instead of outright pointed out to you any more? This is a poor-man's, dumb-movie version of something that's been done better. Tim Curry does a far better job as Pennywise too... like there's any other thing that needs to matter in the movie.The acting is fine, but the direction and everything else is pointless; just like this remake. I seriously can't believe people think this movie is even worth 5 stars; it's rubbish.",3,1,2,27 November 2018
Jurassic World," Rubbish, rubbish, rubbish
","How low is the bar these days? How does something so derivative and uninspiring still manage to garner 7 stars on a large review database?Acting wasn't the problem, which is a nice change in terrible movies, but this story... Wow. THAT is a story? It's basically the original Jurassic Park, but far, far worse, but following the exact same series of events.Dinosaurs? Check. Two children (one of whom is obsessed by dinosaurs)? Check. Bad guys looking to exploit dinosaur research? Check. Obvious plot as to how dinosaurs are more intelligent than expected? Check. OTT action that is beyond the scope of physical possibility? Check. Actors always being in the wrong place at the wrong time, but able to 'somehow' get through it? Check.This was terrible. Shyte in fact. This says far too much about the state of the audience than I'd care to speculate on if they're enjoying this. The fact that a new one has been green-lit says a lot too.I clearly have nothing in common with the low-expectation audience that passes as a movie critic (not that these exist any more) these days.",3,4,5,26 July 2017
