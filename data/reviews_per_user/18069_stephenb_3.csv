Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great fun, the critics are full of it
","We waited two weeks to see it because of all the hype about long lines but saw it in a house that was only half full. It was gripping from beginning to end, after which there was a loud long ovation.  My wife and I enjoyed thoroughly, and have seen it again with great enjoyment, though we're both in our 50's.  Our teenage son pointed out a subtlety we hadn't appreciated, that the Senator who is elected to lead the senate, is the same character (and actor) who becomes the evil emperor in the later installments.  We can't wait for episodes II and III (and VII, VIII, and IX for that matter).",9,0,0,29 June 1999
Ocean's Eleven," formulaic
","An over-rated, formulaic glorification of crime with high production values, offering young movie hunks but with only marginal acting or plot.  Poor Julia Roberts gets an abyssmal part and but fails to redeem it with an uninspired uninteresting performance as the only woman in the film.  The highlights were Carl Reiner, the chinese acrobat, and an interesting twist at the end.",6,0,1,11 July 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Quite a ride, but not for everyone.
","The Two Towers will thrill you and drain you, don't plan on doing anthing too ambitious afterword. The computer animated Gollum, Ents and hordes of orcs are perfect or near to it. Don't look for a beginning or an end as it is the middle installment of a trilogy but it moves you there so intensely from the opening flicker you barely notice that this is the first major sequel with no reprise of the first installment to bring you up to date. Peter Jackson and crew take a few liberties with Tolkien's masterpiece but none too objectionable for all but the most extreme purists, and there are some welcome surprises as well.  The Two Towers is dark and bloody with one of the longest battle scenes since The Longest Day with little relief from the intensity. Not for children and for those looking for women with large heroic roles.  The first and third installments have more of that. The three hours fly by, though be sure not to drink too many fluids or you may have to get up and miss much in the middle!  Another masterpiece of film magic, I can't believe I have to wait another year for the last installment!",10,0,1,18 December 2002
