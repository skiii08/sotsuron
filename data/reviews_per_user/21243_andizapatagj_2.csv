Requiem for a Dream," dramatically amazing
","this is one of the best movies ever made with the best performances. Ellen Burstyn is just incredible in her role as sarah and jared leto and jennyfer conelly are also very good. I think the clear message of this movie is anti-drugs but also found many elements important of this movie as how dreams can fall to pieces, people can be naive and loneliness can make you desperate and even can drive you to destruction in the case of sara. I felt also so depressed for the characters of conelly and leto that were in love in such a pure way and then became depraved and destructed by their addictions. Addictions destroy everything but not only addiction for drugs but also for people, for feeling right and loved or even happy. The last scene had me crying till the credits ended and i just couldn't stop. Its so heartbreaking to watch how this characters that seemed full of dreams, happiness and hopes at the beginning could end up becoming so pathetic and dark. When letos character lost his arm i was impressed and also when conelly was selling her body for drugs and sara was in the siquiatric hospital, those were painful scenes to watch. But i think one scene that also got me crumble was the part when conelly and leto talk on the phone and by then you just know nothing will be the same again for them. The photography and effects were just excellent and managed to drive you crazy but also to know what characters were feeling when they were high. This movie must be watched because as hard as it is important for everyone to realize how dangerous drugs really are and how addictions and extremes can destroy your life no matter how old or smart you think you are.",10,0,0,4 February 2008
Forrest Gump," if we all were like forrest gump
","I was reading some critics of people that didn't like this movie and i thought how could someone in this world not enjoy a film like this? its true thats very long and sometimes slow but tom hanks manages to keep you interested the whole film. Forrest Gump is a character we would all like to become, someone innocent that cant understand why things happen around him. Why he can walk, why the girl e loves cant love him back or is always running away form him, why his best friend died in war or why the character of gary siniese cant enjoy his life. Until the end of the film he cant even understand if we make up or destiny or its written for us. This is a beautiful movie with many things to tell. The character i liked the most after forrest was jenny, she never knew what she wanted and she was escaping from happiness into a world that only wanted to deprave her living aside the only man that really loved her in a pure and sincere way. This is other important fact of the 60s as it describes the history of the USA in that time seen by the eyes of a man that wanted to make everyone happy and live in his own Innocent world away from wars, racism, drugs and problems the society faced back then. He is just one of the characters of a movie you never forget and teach you so much about life and yourself at the same time. I think it could be describe as one of forrest phrases 'life is like a box of chocolates. you never know which one you're gonna get'",10,1,3,4 February 2008
