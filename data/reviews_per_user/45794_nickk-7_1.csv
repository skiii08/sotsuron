Skyfall," Terrible Bond Film
","There are so many issues with this film it isn't funny. First, on the train when Bond is shot; why doesn't the agent empty the rifle on the enemy she missed? Silly. In the casino, Bond loses his gun, but after getting back to the top of the bridge, walks away without picking up the pistol. How could the antagonist escape from his glass enclosed prison? The scene at 'M's' hearing with the shootout was silly. The antagonist couldn't escape that. The showdown at Skyfall was equally silly. Good effects, but stupid. Even if 'M' could escape to the chapel, she would obviously hide and the grounds keeper would get several shots off. The antagonist would have killed 'M' upon site without the drama. And Bond's killing him was silly. This movie is at best a 'B' movie with effects. A truly terrible Bond film!",1,11,20,22 February 2013
