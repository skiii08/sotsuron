Sucker Punch," I felt sucker punched after watching this movie
","I'd been excitedly awaiting Sucker Punch since I first saw the movie trailer in theaters quite some while ago. I don't think there are any spoilers in this review, other than perhaps some mentions of the movies character.Being a fan of anything extraordinary/fantasy-like and loving Zack Snyders 300, i was sure this would be a hit for me. But no...I find the storyline totally incomplete and shallow, no matter which (in lack of a better word) 'parallelle mind-universe' Babydoll enters. The movie would have been much better if there had been more of a story to it. And there could easily have been so many great stories in this movie.Both the musical and visual effects are to my taste, and I like the way Sucker Punch was filmed. The visual ideas and effects are why I ended on giving Sucker Punch rating of 3 stars. That being said, It seems to me that Sucker Punch pretends to be a much deeper movie than it really is, and that it uses it's 'mind-games' as an excuse not to give us more of a story. When really, it is poorly thought out, and no think-it-through-yourself can replace what should have been a better movie.Yes, I had to think about the whole movie for a minute afterward to sort it out in my head, but after that my impression of this film was a disappointing one. It is OK to watch, just don't expect an impressive storyline, as I did.",3,1,8,29 June 2011
