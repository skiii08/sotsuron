Black Swan," Decidedly the most excellent film of 2010
","This film is about an artist's quest for perfection and the glass caged hell she creates, while striving for the impossible goal of that fleeting perfection. It would be far better, this film says, for the artist(dancer) to find some piece of imperfection which she can hold on to, and claim as her own personal and unique stamp on the world.As Winonna's character says, 'I am not perfect' This acknowledgment is perhaps her key, her path to her own redemption. Sorry to say Nina never finds her own path!Also this film pays major tribute to the 1948 hit 'The Red Shoes' which sent generations of ballerinas back to the dance floor... I can only imagine that this film will do much the same! They are both equally spectacular.This film is very modern, and asks a lot of its viewers, but if you are willing and able, it will pay you handsomely for your suspension of disbelief!BRAVO!",10,3,7,19 December 2010
Gravity," An excellent, well written, designed and executed movie
","Many other fine people have used many words to say why they loved this film, and I pretty much agree with all of these reviewers, so rather than recover old ground, let me just say a few words about why I disagree completely with so many of the very low reviews this movie received, and leave it at that.I think i can best sum up my feelings towards these negative reviewers, all of whom I can count on for getting almost every film that i like completely wrong, (and who are all males,) by relating a question one such person asked, at the beginning of his review, 'What am I missing here?' The movie, is my least stinging response to that question :) - Also one of the main complaints about the Physics of this film, IE why would the safety line between the two main characters be tight, is easy enough to answer... it has to do with viewpoint... IE, if the camera is moving in the same way that the objects around it are rotating, nothing appears to be moving... or as Einstein said, all objects are relative to all other objects.<ul><li>I would also like to note that the members of the Academy are really a bunch of tight-assed little wimps... such that when they can see that a particular movie is going to win a bunch of Oscars they will yank the Oscar for the leading lady in the film... This never seems to happen to leading men. A good example of the same exact thing happened to 'The Piano', the last film that I really agreed with the academy on their choice of best film-director etc., except here again they yanked the obvious choice for best leading female role solely so as not to appear too partial to one particular film!</li></ul>Stupid choice then, stupid choice now!",10,4,7,27 February 2014
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Why I can never erase any of my memories
","look I rated this movie a ten, and deservedly, but it does bother me just a little that the main characters would be quite so willing to trust someone fairly unknown with erasing their brains... I don't get enough info in the film, as to why this organization is so trustworthy in the eyes of the main characters.... and after you get into the film... well things seem even more... you knowi don't want to give the story away, so I can't say more...but watch it, don't you agree?other than that, I really enjoyed the film, and would recommend it to anyone who has an open mind and a romantic heart... some things harder to find nowadays!",10,0,1,29 September 2004
Edge of Tomorrow," great film
","OK - so I haven't actually seen the film yet.. I am here simply to complain about the abysmal quality of the grammar used in the reviews! People seem unable to complete a real sentence without falling into false stops and stuttering's along the way Can you please learn the basics of sentence structure and grammar before you start writing film reviews, as I have nothing but contempt for people who can't write worth a damn, and thereby I will likely ignore or have complete contempt for your comments! thank you very much!PS -I will actually write a real review once I have seen the movie! Have a nice day! :)Oh and the rest of this is just fill so I can get this damn thing in!",10,7,21,29 May 2014
Inception," A great wind signifying absolutely nothing
","This film has everything that you would want for in a film this complex and mind bending... everything except an ending that makes sense of it all! After spending over 2 hours falling through levels, and bending my mind around levels within levels withing levels, and still not knowing what the hell any of this is about, i simply concluded that the film was one big piece of slightly boring eye candy that made, and was supposed to make, absolutely no sense what so ever! And as a giant piece of eye fluff it does pretty well... but it could have been so much more! You might ask what more? but to be honest i can really say... and really it doesn't matter any way - because it's not my film! I am so tired of telling other people how to fix their films... after they are already in the can! Figure it out yourself!",5,7,11,28 September 2011
Step Up," Kicks way higher than Flash DAnce & I like that movie!
","Yeah yeah... we have seen it before.... bla bla bla...Well I got a clue for ya! Try to write a GREAT dance-movie script, and when I see it on the screen, and if I think you did a much better job than the folk that wrote this one... I will Shake your hand... until then, stuff it, with your low review comments! This was a very credible movie, with some great story to it... and the acting was actually not fantastic, but pretty good! I liked it!!! And the part where the car gets stolen, etc... and finally the brother actually starts to question what he has been doing with his life!!! that went right to my heart!!! so, maybe a 9.5, but I gave it a 10 just to make up for all you winning low lifers!",10,0,3,21 August 2006
