Source Code," If you thought Inception was Greek,you will instantly fall in love with this one!
","21st Century's movies have become more sophisticated to watch and even more to understand.Every filmmaker has his own way of telling a story.But,when it comes to sci-fi,using some of the basic science concepts an weaving it to a movie's storyline is just amazing. Having said that,Source Code relies upon Quantum Mechanics in its storyline.Now Quantum Mechanics,as most people know,is one of the most complicated branches of Science ever.So naturally,the movie goer expects a twisted screenplay. But the biggest factor acting in the movie's favor is its lucid style of storytelling,that keeps the audience hooked to the screens from the first minute of the movie till the end. The movie reminds you of Deja Vu and Vantage Point at places.Especially,the Vantage Point's way of story telling,by replaying the some of the same scenes again and again,and at the same time,revealing some important twists along the way. Although an intense action/sci-fi/mystery thriller,the movie will be loved by men and women,movie buffs and non-movie buffs alike. Although the movie boasts of many plus-points,I was quite disappointed with the visual effects in this movie.Blame me,but my eyes have only begun to accept High Definition and filter everything out! On the acting front,I think this is a landmark movie for Jake Gyllenhaal,and he will be popularly known the world over as the 'Source Code' star. Although,I expected more of Vera Farmiga on screen. OK,let me stop here now,on thing though,don't read the synopsis until you watch the movie on big-screen! Trust me,this is one of those movies,where you should blindly go by what the Movie Critic says....!",8,0,1,3 May 2011
About Time," This was Unexpected.
","The welding of a concept of time-travel to a rom-com,well,that,is indeed really unexpected.Time travel and rom-com are in the two opposite sides of the movie-genre spectrum and Richard Curtis does a quite impeccable job of bringing them together,and well,the end result is magnificent.The movie,although is a romantic comedy,explores the relationship of a father with his son.The central theme of the story is that,Tim Hall,the protagonist of the film,inherits the ability to travel back in time from his father,and how he uses it to his advantage.Although the movie is a different take on love stories,its like what a good love story should be,i.e. funny and interesting.The movie showcases the trials and tribulations of Tim,right from 21 years of age till he has his fourth child.Overall,Tim Hall leads a near perfect life,barring a few moments.Having said that,well,the cons are,the movie gets a bit too dragged at times,and could have been shortened a bit.Also,the movie is a little bit too happy.But that's expected,since,the protagonist uses his gift very well to his advantage,to an extent,he can't. The performances are beautiful,especially from Bill Nighy. As for Richard Curtis,in my opinion,I still feel his directorial debut,the love anthology film,Love Actually better than this one.To conclude, this is a adorable,fun movie,one that is better,when watched with a loved one.",7,2,3,4 January 2014
Cast Away," Loneliness definitely haunts........
","Imagine being in a island alone for four long years,with no company,no shelter,surrounded by saline water all over.How would you feel?Only Tom Hanks can make such good movies.I absolutely loved Forrest Gump,Apollo 13,and now this!I just watched it a few days ago and six years later and every part of the movie remains etched in my memory. The story is simple,it is about how Chuck Noland(Tom Hanks),a FedEx employee becomes a castaway in a island after a terrible plane crash in the ocean,is left to fend for himself. The rest is how he survives the island and finally comes out of it.The locations are exotic and the story is wonderfully executed. As for the Special Effects,it's amazing.The movie,like Forrest Gump,The Shawshank Redemption,Its A Wonderful Life speaks about hope,courage,survival and in short about the strange twist and turns of fate.Frame by Frame,the movie reminds you of Robinson Crusoe but, then you realize that even a common man can become a Crusoe,if he wants to get back to his world,his family,his love.On the acting front,the movies,in its entirety belongs to Tom Hanks,Helen Hunt does her part well,but the rest of the cast come only for a while in the beginning and in the end.Its a Tom Hanks show all the way.While I can't call it a masterpiece,the movie is definitely worth to be watched a few times.Thank You for reading",8,2,3,8 July 2010
