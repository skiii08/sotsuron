Black Swan," Major Disappointment
","I rarely stop movies before they're over. Black swan got ejected a little over half way through. I had to make myself watch it that far.Yes, there will be some spoilers following...The concept? Awesome... the execution? Lacking.I understand that dancing is a serious business and that there will be conflicts, accusations of sleeping around to get roles, etc. HOWEVER ... the director seems to be intent on taking the sexual aspect to the extreme and focuses on masturbation and girl on girl oral sex to make a statement. Not sure what statement that is...The mother was so clich√©, there isn't much need to complain about her, but here goes. She is way too overbearing, and obviously wants to live through her daughter. She cages her up and tries to rule all aspects of her life while she (the mother) has no life of her own.The director is supposed to be some sort of playboy, but he is a)too old and b) too unconvincing. 'Go home and touch yourself, Nina.' Oh, please. He is just saying that so he won't have to sleep with her, even though we are supposed to believe he really wants to. Not saying the man may not like the ladies, but it's painfully obvious he isn't that interested in Nina sexually.I have no interest in ever finishing Black Swan.This film has flimsy dialogue, long moments of awkward silence and flat imagery. It could have been brilliant, but what I saw was lackluster and disgusting.",1,8,15,16 June 2011
