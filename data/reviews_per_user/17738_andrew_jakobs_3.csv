Ali," Worst movie EVER!!!
","I have seen this movie, but I cannot recommend it to anyone... It's the worst movie I've seen in about 10 years, Poor acting, No story whatsoever, much too long, wrong use of camera for the time it takes place (My god they used Video in an movie that takes place in 1960-70). The movie is just a bunch of scenes which are put together with no real coherent story, You never know how much time has passed, at one time they say something like 'He finally got his title back which was taken from him in 1967' but it's not clear in which year he got his title back (Maybe unless you are a ali/boxing fan), it wasn't even really clear in what year his title got taken.. Some scenes are much too long and have no real relation to the movie (Like Malcom X being shot, you see a whole 5 minute or so on him being shot, but you only see 10 seconds of ali in mourn about his 'friend'.. BS.. a radio message was more than enough to portrait MX being shot) And there are far more examples of MX throughout the movie...If you think 'The Insider' was boring, don't go to ALI...Micheal Mann had some good movies, but his last good one was HEAT....",1,11,23,27 February 2002
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," what the hell was this boring no story movie?
","This was really one of the most boring movies I've seen in a long while. There really isn't a real story and a lot of scenes are just dragging..
It's not a real coherend story, with only a few separate scenes spliced together. Friends of Tarantino show up on cue.. No real spicy dialogs as we're used to..
Sorry but people putting a 10 on this have been smoking what Pitt smoked near the end of the movie...
The acting itself is good, but sadly the story goes nowhere.. I had more fun watching an Uwe Boll movie than watching this Tarantino movie...",4,2,6,23 November 2019
The Thin Red Line," boring and pretentious monologues
","This one starts sooo slow, and goes really nowhere... The most annoying thing about the whole movie is that you just don't care about any of the characters (at least I didn't) as the story just hops from one to another and back without you really getting to know the character. The other most annoying thing is the pretentious overwritten dialog, a lot of times it is spoken with such an slow overacted southern tone just to make you think the monologue is any good and deep (the 'narration' or what the character is thinking). The regular spoken dialogs between characters is also not that interesting.. And how about overacting of some actors who hoped to get an Oscar with it.. The movie runtime is about 170minutes, but most time is wasted on useless pan's and slow dialogs/monologues.. Also some scenes where so overly 'look at this' and really had nothing really to add to the story.If they had tightened the script, concentrated the amount of characters to follow it could have been one hell of a movie..The war-action is well done, but because of the slow pace of the rest it really makes you not care anymore or really excited..It's nothing like 'apocalypse now', 'saving private ryan', 'Full metal jacket' or any other kind of war-movie I have seen, it's just a 170 minutes long boring movie...",3,1,5,17 February 2010
