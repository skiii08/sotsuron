Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The good, the bad, and the ugly
","THE GOOD:1. Natalie Portman as the Queen. She's unbearably cute and very regal.2. The story. Who says it was boring and difficult to understand? Not for me. Its the story of how evil Senator Palpatine rose to power on the back of the attack on Naboo. It's also the story of the Jedi and the prophecy of Anakin bringing balance to the force.3. The pod race.4. The Darth Maul fight.5. The special effects.6. John William's 'choral' soundtrack.7. The development of Palpatine, Obi-Wan, and Anakin.THE BAD1. The lack of development of Qui-Gon. Consequently, one does not seem to care much what happens to him, unlike, say, the way the viewer cares about Anakin leaving his mother.2. The total, complete, sad lack of development of Mr. Bad 'A' Darth Maul. Did he say a single word in the entire movie?3. Who is Darth Sidious? Is he really Senator Palpatine? Is he Palpatine's brother or his friend? Does he have anything to do with Palpatine at all?4. The 'oh, I'll guess I'll hide in this spaceship no one's using. Oh, I guess I'll try to find its blaster switch. Oops, I turned it on. Oh, no. Here we go into space. Wow, I turned off the autopilot system somehow. Oops, I crashed perfectly in the middle of the enemy ship. Oh, no, my ship's broken. Wow, It's back online all of a sudden, thats nice. Hehe, I'm gonna sit and blast troops for a while with my big gun. Oops, I hit the reactor core. Fiddle dee dee, clumsy ol' me. Wow, the big enemy ship blew up. Did I do that?' thing that happens to Anakin. If Anakin is to be a powerful warrior, it should have been: 'Ha, I'll 'hide' in this spaceship. Im escaping. I'm destroying enemy ships. I found my way to the main reactor using my skill and the force. Boom, I blew it up all by myself.'5. Why do some Jedis (Yoda, Ben) disappear when they die and some (Qui Gon, Vader) don't? And why is QuiGon the trainer of Obi Wan when Obi Wan said in the Trilogy that Yoda was his trainer? I'm getting picky now.6. The variety of cliffhangers and loose strings that make the viewer say quite tragically, 'Geez, its gonna be six more years. I hope China doesn't decide to nuke us before then.'7. The problem with prequels is you know what happens to the characters from the later movies. Anakin turns real bad, Senator Palpatine turns even worse, Yoda and Ben go into hiding, the rest of the Jedi will be destroyed, and Anakin and the Queen will have Luke and Leia. But getting from one to four involves so much more than just that, and TPM was a good set up for the next two.THE UGLYWell, I couldn't imagine anything more annoying than the Ewoks, at least until now. When I watch the movie for the next umpteen million times I will want to kill this Jar-Jar whatever and all of his Jamaican talking fishy race.I hope you saw the Trilogy before viewing this flick, or you may not get too excited about the mention of Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan, Yoda, and Jabba the Hut.All in all, a great movie, better than Return but worse than Hope and Empire.9.5/10",9,0,0,19 May 1999
The Sixth Sense," Not quite as good as I thought it would be
","With all of the good commentaries I read about 'TSS' I expected much more out of the film than I got.The main problem with the film is its persistent slowness and confusing development. Some of the supernatural the child 'sees' is given without any explanation, like the 'ghosts' in the story have no other purpose but to frighten the viewer. The film suffers from a short attention span, jumping from one storyline right to the other with no explanation. The film also focuses too heavily on the score; there is a point where Willis and the boy are sitting in a room by themselves for about a half minute, not saying a word, while the film's music is playing at full forte. Had there been an important plot revelation at the time it would have seemed sensible, but the attitude was more like, 'we spent x number of dollars on this score, so we darn better well use it anywhere we can.'The ending of the movie is genius (which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of one) but by the time I reached it I was so bored and disappointed that it did not have much of an effect on me. It seemed like the writer dreamed up of a perfect ending to a movie but could not put anything worthwile as filler. If the movie was more like an hour-long 'Amazing Stories' episode, it would have been perfect; but as is it was a little too drawn out for me.***/out of ten",3,1,1,10 August 1999
