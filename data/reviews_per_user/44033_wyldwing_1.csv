The Blair Witch Project," Wow....
","This movie is what horror and terror is all about.First let me comment on the bad reviews that I've read...some people say that the Blair Witch Project wasn't scary at all and some were bored by the experience.  These are the people that have no imagination and go in with the attitude 'this movie is all fake and pretends to be real...how dumb...'OF COURSE IT'S FAKE!Friday the 13th movies aren't scary for the same reason....they are totally fake.  What Blair Witch has that most horror films don't is an incredible feeling of suspense and wonderment.  You FEEL for these kids as they trek through the forest and lose their minds!Maybe I'm too hard in the above comments, but when I was watching this movie, I (with use of my imagination) felt like I was on the trip too...everthing FELT so real...and the apology...and the final house sequence...That IS TERROR.I go to movies to enjoy them and be totally immersed in them...not to criticize them and not enjoy myself..In short this movie is THE HORROR film of the year!!  SEE IT!",10,1,2,30 September 1999
