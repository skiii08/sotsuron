Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Most overrated movie in IMDb?
","It's quite funny movie, besides that all jokes are really stupid, and probably the only reason why it's funny is because it's made documentary like, so you think that it's 'real'. Actually I'm pretty sure that other side (people who meets Borat) were prepared, otherwise they won't be able to film it. So this movie is quite descent (besides that it can offend a lot of people) but having a rating 8.2 at this time when I'm writing, and taking #179 place in all time movie top??... Come on... Is it really better than 'Walk the line' (#197), 'Snatch' (#209), 'Scarface' (1983)? In my opinion it's a very mediocre movie, which won't even be funny after few years.",5,6,12,18 November 2006
