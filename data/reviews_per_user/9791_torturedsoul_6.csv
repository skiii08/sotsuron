Scarface," A legendary actor at his peak
","Scarface was a great movie. It featured Al Pacino as Tony Montana, a greedy and jealous drug kingpin. He gets in the business with his buddy, Manny. His old boss, attempts to kill Montana with a hit man. Montana escapes killing them in the process. He catches up to his boss in the end and murders him, also. The story goes on with a bad hit attempt and Montana being hunted down at the end by the biggest gangster of them all, Sosa. Montana goes from a fresh-faced Cuban immigrant to a leader in the drug business. On that path, he ruins the life of his family, his friends, his associates, and ultimately himself. This movie shows how being on top like that in a terrible industry like that will get you killed and will cause a big downfall. A great movie that is very realistic. I give it an A.",10,0,0,20 June 2001
Forrest Gump," One of the best of the 90's
","I have seen Forrest Gump about 15 times, and every time it drives me to tears. It shows how a man who is not exactly 'right' can be very successful and lead a full life. I hear people all the time criticize this movie, but why? How can't you love this movie? Forrest is so likeable and the filmmakers even succeed in making some humorous parts which is not normal in most dramas. Tom Hanks pulls in a great acting performance as Forrest and their are other great performances, also. Too many of them to name. It deserved that Oscar. I feel that wholeheartedly. I give it an A+.",10,1,2,21 June 2001
Pulp Fiction," A movie that will leave you breathless
","I love Pulp Fiction. There are no two ways about it. From Samuel L. Jackson's hip, but stuck in the 70's gangster to Ving Vhames' big and mean head gangster, this movie provides no shortages of great acting. This movie goes into several parts all kind of coming together in some way or another. John Travola plays, in my opinion, the role of his career as Vincent Vega. He takes out out the head gangster's wife on an almost-fatal date. She snorts herion, and I'll leave it to that. I especially enjoyed Bruce Willis as the boxer. I thought this was a great role for him. He and the head ganster get in a massive fight and the gun-store owner and the sheriff do some repulsive things to the two of them. Christopher Walken has a humorous cameo as the young boxer's father's army buddy. When they kill a man inside their car, Jackson and Travolta go to Quinton Tarantino, who obviously feels a need for acting in his own movies, who in turn calls a 'lets get to business' type in Harvey Keitel. Keitel does a good job in this role as he does in every role he ever does. The ending is very good, also.

The Shawshank Redemption," The greatest movie I have ever seen!
","I LOVE the Shawshank Redemption. It gives the story of a prison inmate in his many years at an institution. This movie is so great, I cried in the middle of it! When Brooks dies has got to be the saddest moment in movie history. I cried for a good 10 minutes. He let his bird go, and he took his life. Very sad stuff. It's great how they start up a library helping the illiterate inmates. It shows some of the atrocites that inmates go through even if they are innocent. A VERY GREAT movie and probably the best of all time. I give it an A++++++.",10,0,0,21 June 2001
The Silence of the Lambs," Disturbing but exciting
","Silence of the Lambs has got to be the greatest Thriller ever made. Hands down. It is so good. The acting is perfect, the camerawork is perfect, and the story is perfect. Can a movie be better than this? Yes, but very rarely is a movie better than this. Hannibal Lector is one of my favorite movie characters ever created. He is brilliant and he is psychotic. He is what every person has nightmares about in their dreadful dreams. He is what wakes people in the middle of the night and physically forces them out of bed to take a cold shower. Hannibal Lector is the epitomy of everything that is evil. Lector is the type of man that would make you vomit and make you smile at the same time. If you listen to every word he says, you will see the definition of 'genious' spill out all over your mind. I think Hopkins deserved more than an Oscar for his perfect acting as Lector. That is how well he acted in that role. Of course Jodie Foster was great as Clarice Starling, but Hopkins steals the show. If you want to see a movie that will stand the test of time, watch Silence of the Lambs.I give it an A+++++++++++",10,0,0,21 June 2001
Goodfellas," absolutely classic
","I love this movie. I think this is the ultimate gangster movie. The acting is absolutely fantastic. Pesci, Liotta, and DeNiro all pull in great performances. I think this movie will live to be one of the classic movies of all time. Pesci won Best Supporting Actor for this movie, and it's very well-deserved. He stole the show with his crazy, cowboy-like character, Tommy. His cussing and killing is so convincing, it makes Pesci look like the type of guy that would really blow a guy's head off in real life. Liotta showed that he has the talent to lead a movie, and do it sucessfully. DeNiro shows once again why he is considered to be one of the greatest actors of all time. Lorraine Bracco is very good as Karen Hill. I think the camerawork is spectacular providing great shots from all angles. This movie shows everyone what gangster movies are supposed to be like. I give it an A++++++++++++",10,0,0,25 June 2001
