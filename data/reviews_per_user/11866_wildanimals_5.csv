One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Falls a little flat sometimes, but still a favourite
","Although it falls flat at some points, 101 Dalmatians has always been a favourite of mine. Maybe it is the scratchy style of the artwork that does it, maybe the delightful personalities of the characters, or maybe the entertaining villains. Who knows? Based on the brilliant book by Dodie Smith, it's the familiar tale of the cute little dalmatian puppies escape across the wild and snowy countryside, in a desperate race against time.Full of imagination, humour, and just plain charm, this is a must see for all Disney fans. No, it's not Walt's most thought-provoking effort, but it's way better than what modern Disney can think of nowadays.",8,5,7,2 July 2007
Ratatouille," Pure delight
","Rats, face it, are not the most popular creature on Earth, even if they are one the most numerous. Look at the vile creature that sneaks into the baby's room in Lady and the Tramp and you'll get a good idea of Man's perception on these little creatures.But Pixar transforms these 'vile little beasties' into something completely adorable and lovable. And so, we get Remy. Remy's dream is to become a chef and eat real food instead of the rubbish that rats usually feast upon. After being separated from his family in an 'American Tail'-esquire way, he goes on a crazy ride through the sewers (in the style of 'Fievel goes West') and ends up under Paris. Meanwhile, a young man named Linguinie, on the wishes of his dead mother, is given a job at the three (formely five) star restaurant Gusteau's. When the two finally meet after a near-miss with some soup, the talent-less Linguinie realises his cooking potential in the little animal...Sure, it might seem a bit far fetched with the whole 'rat knows how to cook' theme, but Ratatouille is just such a funny, sweet and charming film that you'll forget all about it. It's touching without getting too overly sentimental and it's funny without becoming too juvenile and forced (that one too often sees in todays numerous CGI flicks). The food in the film looks very delicious. It doesn't look like plastic at all. I know this is going to sound weird, but even the cake in the rubbish heap looked tasty. Ratatouille will not only evoke emotions, it''ll evoke your stomach too! The rendering and imagery is just fantastic.The plot is fun and more importantly, unpredictable - which was a real problem in Pixar's previous films. The characters are memorable too. If I had to sum up Ratatouille in one word, it would be 'sweet.' Linguinie's somewhat odd friendship with Remy is sweet, all of the rats look sweet, just the entire film is sweet and funny. Go see Ratatouille - it's a delightful offering in today's animated wasteland.",9,2,5,28 October 2007
The Little Mermaid," Excellent Disney Classic
","I was never a fan of The Little Mermaid when I was a child, but after re-watching it, I find it to be a very funny, sweet and charming Disney film. It has everything that's typical of a good Disney movie - great music, a cool villain, likable protagonists, amusing sidekicks and a gripping plot.I like Ariel's headstrong nature. She's rebellious and passionate without being 'bratty' like the 'adolescents' we see in cheap direct-to-video sequels. There is not a single sidekick that I found annoying. They all had their fair share in the story, and weren't just there for the sake of it. Ursula is one of Disney's best villains. She has a fabulous song and believable motives. I think she's pretty much the standard that many Disney villains are judged by.The music is fun to listen to. The songs are unforgettable (if a bit too numerous for my liking). 'under the Sea' is especially catchy, but my favourite would have to be 'Kiss the Girl.' It's atmospheric without being over the top.The animation is a little dated, but aside from that this is a must see Disney movie. It brought Disney back up to the top and revived animation. Too bad Disney made a crappy sequel (and a third one is coming soon).",10,1,1,27 December 2007
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," So weird but so hilarious
","This is one of the best, but most bizarre comedies you'll ever see. The Monty Python team take you back 900 years to ancient Britain. We embark on a quest with King Arthur and his Knights to find the legendary Holy Grail. What follows is a hilarious adventure involving spoilt stuck-up princes, gory sword fights, wild untamed monsters and shrubberies.Is the plot the most complicated and thought provoking you'll ever see? No. Do the special effects blow you away? No. Could a dead fly have written a better plot line? Yes. So you're probably thinking, why am I giving this ten stars after typing all that? It's because the special effects are low-budget because they're meant to be - I mean, they could have used at least one horse. But it wouldn't be as funny if they did. The plot is so bizarre and ridiculous because if it wasn't, it wouldn't make Monty Python and The Holy Grail the masterpiece it is today. Not many British films get so much attention as this one. And boy, it deserves it. If you find this unfunny, there must be something wrong with your brain.",10,1,2,26 August 2007
The Simpsons Movie," Inferior to the TV show, but not bad on its own merits
","While it is no masterpiece, The Simpsons Movie is one of those few TV-show-turned movies that didn't want to make me gag and kick the TV screen (think Tom and Jerry: The Movie.) I feel that The Simpsons has gone down in quality in the last few years, so this movie pleasantly surprised me. It won't win any awards, but as a long time Simpsons fan, I was not disappointed.The plot is a simple one which involves Homer indirectly causing Springfield to be enclosed in a giant dome. It is up to America's favourite yellow family to save the day. The plot plays out like a regular episode, but it is slightly more surreal. Obviously, there is quite a bit of filler, but it is entertaining filler so I can forgive the film for that.My only real major quibble with this film is that it is simply too odd at times. I remember The Simpsons as being a down-to-earth show, and there are sequences here that look like they have jumped right out of Balto II: Wolf Quest. They are funny sequences, but unnecessary.What I like most about The Simpsons Movie is that it knows that it is nothing groundbreaking or spectacular, and it doesn't try to be anything different. If you are a fan, this is definitely worth checking out, because it has more than enough replay value.",7,2,4,9 April 2008
