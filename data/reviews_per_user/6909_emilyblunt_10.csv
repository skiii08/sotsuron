The Legend of Bagger Vance," Snor-a-rama!
","I just didn't like it. I can not stand when a director, in this case Robert Redford, thinks by giving me emotional music and a huge helping of gosh golly characters , I'm gonna feel for the movie. It was about GOLF, not characters!The cinematography was well done- but they cheesed out and used about four sets to give the period piece a look of a low budget network miniseries.
The paper mache characters were a snore. Wafer thin and grating on the nerves with there buck-tooth behaviours.LOBV story goes... Randolf Junuh (Demon, er, Damon), the local Savanian big wig waspy golf pro/champion is back from the war (WW1). He's a bit bug house in the head and poor devil just can't seem to get his golf swing back. Sniff.However, when his city of Savannah calls on him to defend their honor in a high stakes golf tournament- held by his ex-love Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron)- he normals hisself right up.The quintessential mad man's beard is shaved, his hobo hat traded for a Harvard Buzz, and his paupers pants chucked for Argyles and wools. Okay, he's not entirely normal Norman again. He wanes back and forth 'tween golf player and life loser.Even with the mysterious stranger, Baggar Vance (Will Smith) by his side giving him golfing tips and Buddism- metaphysical-motivational-lectures Randy may just lose the game. Heaven forbid!The characters are not 3D enough for us to give two hearty hoots. The subject- is more about a golf game than anything else- gets old nano-fast. I am happy to say I have not seen this much golf in my entire young life. Nor did I ever intend to.Damon plays Randy with his usual nonchalant style to perfection. He seems so dull, no? His work never has any zing. Admittedly, Matt's getting to be quite the breedable stallion in the stable. However there's that one snaffu, his colossal teeth are still simply frightening in a 'are the dang things gonna leap outta the boy's mouth and start biting folk?' way. But the choppers aside, this mansteak looks quite edible in his 1920's wardrobe. Yep, my- tea--fine. Got to love a man in British wools. Yummy.Poor Will Smith on the other hand, is reduced to an Uncle Tomish sort of duh-ha, well that's just malarkey thar missus, and yessin' sir boss man. He's that all 'knowing' without tellin' style of guardian angel. Snore.Charlene Tiltawhirlaron was good. In fact all the actors were good even the boy J Michael Moncrief. But he's no Haley Joel Osment. It's just BV' s subject/plot was so dang dull. I mean Peter Frampton Live with Poison as an opening act dull. Pass.Even double Dutch chocolate treat Will Smith couldn't keep the sand man from sneaking about my seat and side swiping me into a comatose state. I snored as loud as a 515 train pulling into boogaloo Station a few times.Dixie cup review? LOBV didn't keep this gal's interest. I was hoping it would end so I could get home and rewatch Sid And Nancy.It tries so hard to be an artsy beautiful film, but for all it's pomp and stance Redford's produced a snor-a-rama with dead dull dialog. Justin' aint all that interesting- no how.Snack recommendation: Muffins with warm butter.",Null,2,3,10 November 2000
Meet the Parents," Oivay! This is one funny movie folks!
","A kind of screwball comedy for the new millennium! We all know Ben Stiller is a fantastic comedian, and Robert DeNiro would be good reciting a shopping list, ad to this director Jay Roach and bingo- a funny night at the movies.Story goes...Greg Focker (Ben 'pearly whites' Stiller) is meeting his girlfriend Pam's (Teri Polo) parents at her sister's wedding this weekend. He's hoping they'll accept and like him- he's a likable guy...Hey, if they have kids will Pam be known as Mother Focker? That's all I'm asking.Off they go for a fun filled stress free weekend at the old folk's house. Scary huh?The mother is milk toast. The father, one Jack Byrnes however, well, he's played by Bob DeNiro- what do you think he's like? Three men boyfriend's don't want to hear your related to; Tommy Lee Jones, James Caan, and Robert DeNiro.DeNiro plays his Jack Byrnes as he always does- intelligent, believable and-if you were to cross him- wicked scary . Which of course poor Greg is bound to do. It's a comedy.Byrnes' ways are mean and gruff. He's highly suspicious of Greg's motives in general. So much so he makes him; under go a lie detector test (though in itself not too odd-doesn't everyone have one of those hanging around?), has his 'friends' do a background check on dear Greg and let's the lad know he's got his eye on him. That should make Greg feel right at home...Well, it doesn't, and one thingy after another starts to turn this weekend into a kind of surreal Rosie O'Donnell- eating crackers- naked -on your couch nightmare for poor Greg.This is one hell of a funny movie folks. Stiller who you may recall from Your Friends and Neighbors as being a hirsute little chap, shaved his chest and sported a Speedo for one scene. I laughed so hard, about the Speedos, not him shaving.DeNiro is acting perfection. Isn't he always? We're used to his humorous side after that wonderful Analyze This. Talent to the tenth power.Owen Wilson from that suc-o-rama Shanghai Noon is in here too. I haven't enjoyed anything he's done till now. His acting is fine but his career choices are, well, stinky poo-poo. Poor guy. I mean he went from second fiddle to bit part. Not good. He's talented if a bit homely. Maybe this will put him back on casting lists.
Get out and see this. You can bring the whole family-it's offensive free. For a comedy that is funny, That's something. Enjoy.Starring: Robert DeNiro, Ben Stiller, Nicole DeHuff , Blythe Danner,Teri Polo, Jon Abrahams and Owen WilsonSnack recommendation: Bacon and english muffins.",Null,0,0,10 November 2000
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Could have been 4 stars!
","i Nicholas Cage è un uomo bello! Shame on Captain Corelli's Mandolin for taking away a four star rating from itself! What am I talking about? Well, CCM is one of the most romantic wartime films since English Patient, but, unlike the English Patient with its dramatic heart wrenching- mind-altering ending, Corelli goes past possible perfection and heads into 'enough already' territory. A film afraid to let down any part of an audience (here the Hollywood ending portion of you), often alienates the audience that would have embraced it; this is Captain Corelli's Mandolin.It's a terrible shame, because Nicholas Cage was excellent- once you got over his accent and desperately stopped imagining his other less, shall we say, moviestar roles that sit in your memory caves making you smirk with each uttered 'bello bambino' he presents from his adorable lips. Face it no one takes him serious and Captain Corelli could have changed that...The sexy sleepy eyed mankabab can act. Imagine that! But his filmmakers ruined his glory by foregoing a dialect coach, and leaving a rancid taste of week old mozzarella by way of the unnecessary, ongoing ending which muddied up the awe and left the audience bitter, once again. Think Artificial Intelligence, positively brilliant till Spielberg had to ad that last 30 minutes...Capt. Corelli takes place on picture postcard beautiful (thanks to cinematographer John Toll) Cephalonia (Kefallonia), Greece right as the Greeks have had a small victory in WW2 over in Albania. Hitler doesn't take to well to this small defeat and orders the allied Italians to 'move in' on the Greeks. It's war stuff I won't bore you.On this small, but strategically placed island we meet a beautiful (I, personally, think she looks like a chicken) girl Pelagia (Penelope ' I don't even have to change my last name if we marry momma' Cruz) and her father, the island doctor (a brilliant John Hurt). Pelagia has agreed to marry her studly Greek boyfriend, MANdras (studly Christian Bale) when he returns from the war.They are young and in love, or is it just lust? He's off and she is left alone to worry and wonder as to his faith because Mr. Sensitive, Mandras, never so much as etches his 'X' into a letter and she fears he is gone forever.Meanwhile her father, in dire need of medical supplies, agrees to house a captain from the Italian army that's been sent by the allies to secure Cephalonia. More war stuffThe captain, named Antonio Corelli (Nick - remember to call Emily Blunt-Cage) is a life-loving, free spirit caught up in a war with his childhood friends not hell-bent on killing anyone, as, I imagine many young men are in a war. Capt Corelli will only shoot you if your opera preference is Verdi, then he has no mercy, and will not be held responsible for his troop's reaction. It's a little joke, as his men are all singers or musicians and part of an opera club back home. He and his bellowing Italians almost make war look fun.Pelagia and Capt. Corelli get off to a bad start. She thinks he's an ass for being so happy while war is all around them. He thinks she's adorable when she yells. So you know love is sneaking in through the goat's cheese poop of circumstances surrounding them. Naturally Mandras, her betrothed love, returns just as her heart and head is filled will wild Rhesus monkey sex thoughts of the charming Capt. and herself alone on one the many romantic island beaches partaking in some mixing of two ancient cultures under the Grecian moon.But, before the two men can battle each other the war takes a turn and Hitler is no longer cozy with the Italians. He's sending other Italian squads north to concentration camps and Capt. Corelli must make a decision involving trust and his future.As they say in Italian as the last drop of Chianti Classico Castello di Volpaia is sipped from the roman goblet, 'il partito è sopra'
Sure, I'm biased about Cage- I adore this fellow. Admittedly, I'd like to wrap his tilapia in tzatziki and slowly undress him like the fine-layered moussaka he is. I also think he's become easy pickin's for the meaner-spirited press. Yes, he's the chairman of the board at the Nicholas Cage School of Acting where the motto is: 'one expression equals all expressions,' but he really did a good job in Corelli and it will go unnoticed and ridiculed. He's no Benicio del Toro or Gary Oldman in the impeccable dialect/accent department. It seemed Nicky's education on Italian accent pronunciation probably involved simply popping in couple of Coppola's scenes involving a Godfather movie or two, while he slurped down an espresso. Next time he'll invest a little time. But still, he was, as always, enjoyable to watch and a helluva lot better than expected!
Christian Bale looked his usual dangerous sexy self. I think I need a fix of American Psycho. He's a talented fellow who commands his screen.
John Hurt, what can I say that hasn't been said in his long career? He's an ever-morphing actor who, no doubt, hires a dialect coach when on call for a 'foreign' role. Ahem.Penelope Cruz didn't suck. I admit I don't understand the Hollywood hubbub around her. I think she resembles Ringo Starr in drag quite frankly but, I'm not a clam diggin' gal or a red-blooded man so, I'll leave it at that. She tries to be all pouty a little too much here or her performance would have been much better. I have liked a couple of her works so I'll spare her the verbal ballet.Snack Recommendation: Ouzo and Chianti, served with Porcini Pasta, Pancini Risotto, Patissada di Polenta, dolmades, for dessert, La Nociata and Baklava (walnut kind!)

Snatch," Is genius too bold a statement? Don't think so...
","Is genius too strong an adjective to describe Snatch? I don't think so. What an intelligent piece of collaborative work. The audience is catapulted through this masterpiece relentlessly. Lightning quick shifts, ominous underlying violence and many hearty giggles from the beginning straight to the end await you. British maestro, writer/director, Guy Ritchie ( his first feature was that super Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) is an immense talent who has, once again, has brought to our shores one of the most original and refreshing films of our time.Snatch's story goes...There's been a heist of an eighty-six carat diamond...Franky Four Fingers (Benicio 'Come on man! Don't three freakin' movies out at once mean I can at least smoke in here? Christ!' Del Toro) is the lead bad- guy- robber man. Now he's in charge of bringing the multiple carats to the Jewish launderette. But before he heads to the the stolen goods wash-n-sell, he needs to make a quick pit stop in London...London's well informed of FFF's arrival and the web is strung. Boris the Blade is ready for the sharp- dressed- digit- missing-mutli lingual chap. Boris' mission? Get that diamond from Franky! Hmm. Franky's tough. Franky's mean. Franky's not going down easy. What's his weakness? Fine clothes? A good cigar? Chit chat on precious stones of the Aztecs? Noop. But Boris knows.Now we start to understand the plights of our narrator, a man named Turkish (Jason Statham-yes, he played Bacon in director Rictchie's other masterpiece Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels). He's a pretty straight arrow in the boomerang business of promotions and gamblings. His partner Tommy is about to make a faux pas so terrible, their days of roasting sausages happily in a grill next to their filthy boxing ring may come crashing to an end. A smelly pig pen of an end...Meet the rooter of all Turkish's troubles, a man named Brick Top (Alan 'Austin Powers chompers' Ford). Bricky wants a favor...Brick's running an illegal boxing match and wants to use one of Turk's guys. You don't want to be mixed up with this Black Top, er, Brick Top guy. Think dying at the hands of rabid pigs starved till human meat looks like banana sundaes with extra fudge..A fantastic villain.Enter a few guys (Robbie Gee, Lennie James, and Ade) just eeking by. Till Boris strikes up a deal with them. All they have to do is get the briefcase Franky Four Fingers has bolted to his arm...bring it to Boris and they get their dough...With me so far? Okay, next let's just say Turkish's fore mentioned partner loses the boxer evil psycho Brick Top's counting (and betting heavy bacon bits) on...Enter a 'Piker' named Mickey. Piker appears to be the Queen's Land's slang for white- trash- trailer- park-folk- that live like gypsy's and speak in a brogue meant to daze and confuse their prey.What's this? Where's Franky? Franky's been seen at the jewelers. He was seen at the tailor's (and let me just aside a moment with what fun it is watching actor Del Toro get fitted for several outfits-it was like a virgin's dirty dream- that man can wear clothes- she said wiping the droplets of sweat from her forehead). That's it! New Yorker, cousin Avi's (a hysterical Dennis Farina), jumping the pond- he's very concerned about Franky and his briefcase, er, health.Still cousin Avi can not locate FFF. He calls in a friend, Bullet Tooth (Vinnie -nice and tall. A true manyumsicle- Jones). Bullet's got a bone to pick with just about everyone. If Franky's alive he'll find 'im.You getting the gist? Snatch is a wholly different, fast paced manfest extravaganza. It's a fun frolicking gangster movie..if you will.Brad Pitt's body is even buffer than in Fight Club. How can that be? This guy is a baker's dozen of Krispy Kreme sensations. Yum-o-rama. He's such a phenomenal, exciting actor. You never know what he's going to bring to the screen!Benicio Del Toro finally shows his studmuffin physique again- feared to be a distant memory after the recent rotunda role of Javier .( A friend thought I needed therapy when I insisted he truly was an attractive, intelligent, literate guy) You'll be seeing a lot more of this guy. He's an intense talent who's time has finally come.All the boys were polished and exact. A real treat at the movies! On the way out I asked if I could please pay again so they'd keep bringing in movies this good-they just stared...Get out and see this one. Maybe twice!",Null,0,0,7 February 2001
Pearl Harbor," Four thousand, Navy, Marines and Army boys just looking to dance...
","My blood is red white and blue to begin with, so I think you know the kind of review you'll be reading here.We all know the plot before we even head to the theater. But, I think they did a great job in bringing that day to life, for those of us too young to remember what a shock this attack really was.Plus, Pearl Harbor is a manfest extravaganza to the tenth power. As one of the lovely starlets of the film explained, Pearl Harbor has 'four thousand, Navy, Marines and Army boys just looking to dance...' Whew, she wasn't kidding.All of us remember, or were taught to remember Pearl Harbor. It's always so far away from a reality though. Even the movie 1941, with John Belushi, kept us happily oblivious to the suffering our grandparents or friend's grandparents went through. 3000 men and women lost their lives, 1177 men on the ship the Arizona, alone. Not this one. You go through about a half an hour of non-stop war. Watching helplessly. Be ready.This Pearl Harbor is also a wartime love story. Rafe (an adorable almost Gene Kelly-esque all-American hero looking Ben- humma humma- Affleck) is ready to take on the Nazis but America is not involved in the war 'over there' None the less he's an army pilot hell-bent on being a hero for the flag. At his physical he meets the girl of his dreams, Evelyn ( Kate Beckinsale). But he follows his dreams and agrees to a special assignment with the Royal Air Force. Off he goes.His gal Eve, also in the service, is sent off to Hawaii, Pearl harbor along with his closest friend Danny and some others from his squad.Then the news of the feared and dreaded kind comes to his friends; the poor gunner's a goner.Ralph's friend and childhood pal, Danny consoles the grief stricken Eve...and....well...These things happen. Yeah, didn't see this love snaffu coming. But they had to have something besides the bombings...What's this...a telegram has arrived on base...Meanwhile, we watch the dates moving slowly toward December 7, as our hearts ease up our throats. The date we now know that lives in infamy. Gulp.Pearl Harbor is bombed. Lives are changed forever. Some lives are reborn...But enough about the sadness. Let's talk about Ben's affect. Ben Affleck is simply gorgeous. What is it that makes him so handsome in this? What's the smitt-bug trying to tell me? Ah-ha! It's the old-time clothes. Manly form fitting 100% man cloth. Not big baggy icky jeans and tee shirts that bring even the cutest of men down to a twelve-year-old level. No loud sneakers with logos emblazoned across them. No, he was in manly knickers with a belt to boot. For those of you too young to remember a belt is an ancient device used by men of yesteryear to hold there pants up, against the fear of their underwear being -heaven forbid -exposed. Well, this look works for young chuck steak Affleck in the strongest of ways. His acting was impressive too. Not that they gave him much...But, he lost his signature smirk and stayed concentrated on his character. How'd they get the lad to do that?This other lamb chop, Josh Harnett (Danny) grew on you like those fig newton things tend to... At first he was 'okay' but as the frames flowed into the next his smile got sexier, his arms dreamier, until you were ready to nosh on the whole damn man plate. Josh has certainly come along way in his career. Let's keep an eye on him shall we...Now, thank you Hollywood for casting this gal Kate Beckinsale. She's the daughter of British comic Richard, who had quite a loyal following -over there. Kate did a wonderful job and is simply lovely. She really looked the part of the 1940's American pinup beauty. LOVED her clothes too. Too bad that style wouldn't come back. Somebody call Madonna, she can make it so.The rest of the cast, too numerous to spotlight, are also well cast. Cuba Gooding Jr. has almost a bit part, but it's an important one. Join Voight almost made me laugh outloud at his John Barrymore a' la Dr. Gillespie, President Roosevelt scenes.This is definitely an epic action blockbuster. It's trying to be with out shame. Why is the buzz comparing it to Titanic? Probably because they are both real-life tragedies that intertwine those overly dramatic heart tugging scores and collasal special effects along with a mix-a-blockbuster director that practically puts us front row center for these terrible. They are also both also had huge casualties that could have been avoided if not for the infamous 'missed message.'If Hollywood could get a working script from Cameron Crowe, involving the Hindenburgh Zeppelin in a love -story between a British super agent with a secret passion for pro-wrestling and an American debutante run away from her arranged marriage to a wall street meany of course, starring Russell Crowe and Julia Roberts directed by Steven Soderbergh, they'd try that too! Okay, maybe not. But they are different films.And don't worry if this is just a love story. The action is there, Jerry Bruckheimer, directs it. So, even with it's heavy subject matter, there's almost a Madtv mock movie flair to it at times...Like the extreme close-ups of Affleck and Beckinsale's nose and mouth as they speak in low tones, passionately in love. All we see are six foot flaring nostrils and pouty lips.Then you have that nonstop piping of sad- story- 'epic' music, which goes to work on your emotional psyche from the very first frame. You'll want to weep immediately at it's commencement, but won't be sure why! Oh, and the patented BruckheimerÂ® slow motion action scenes. Those all wrenching running scenes as the tough guy banter and one liners bombard you as fast as the bazillion bullets fly around picking off extra after extra.This film puts it in perspective for us. We were ambushed plain and simple. It's a war thing. We've even done it. Also it was 1941, not the high tech world we live in, a 300 plane air attack coming in undetected? Not gonna happen now buckaroo.Pearl Harbor, it seemed, tried to be honest. Especially in it's portrayal of the leaders and their lack of information that ultimately may have prevented the loss of so many people. They were honest about some of the not so up-and-up tactics the Empire of Japan. They skirt around the issue of life threatening oil blockades a neutral America had set upon Japan. They mention it but, briefly. We are the 'good guys' after all. War is hate. People do things unimaginable to each other. And remember, please, no one is guilt free! That's the beauty of war, it's an equal opportunity ass*%$ maker. Before you go storming into your favorite sushi parlor proclaiming- 'you Jap' this, or 'you Jap' that, remember it was war, a long time ago, and according to not only history but the blurb in the film, we 'left them no choice but to attack.'Just try and remember the folks who did fight these wars on both sides without judgment. Oh, and enjoy Ben and Josh's happening looks.",Null,0,0,26 May 2001
The Mummy Returns," This ain't your mommy's Mummy movie!
","The Mummy Returns relentlessly spews special effects at you like a double barrel assault weapon right from the start. The special effects are almost overwhelming as they ricochet across the screen. At the end of it all you're almost physically dizzy from the continual flurry of clever, if not 'been there, done that' style, of computer generated mummies, goblins, bugs and fight scenes. Scenes that always began with the Hollywood- Raider's- of- the- Lost- Ark- action-movie-music, triumphant yet foreboding, blasting through the Dolby system. It seemed as if they were trying desperately to recreate the magic the 1st Mummy / Brendan Fraser smash hit had with this bombardment of effects and music. Perhaps they thought by confusing us with lots of visual treats we wouldn't notice the gaping plot holes. Don't get me wrong. TMR deserves three stars for it's special effects movie-making techniques alone. The action is great, the scenery is great, the story, in theory, is great. But the (predominantly) returning cast is just blasÃ©, delivering corny jokes and boring dialog. Otherwise, it would have been perfect! Even the extremely evil Imhotep, played by silky smooth Arnold Vasloo, seemed all mellowed out and less hell-bent on evil deeding and mayhem than in The Mummy one. Vasloo's Immie needs a strong shot of attitude as with his first encounter with the meddling Rick O'Connell (Brendan Frasor) and his treasure seeking band of misfits. But, who's looking for Oscar material here? It's Action Flick 101 with sexy actors, actresses and a cute kid thrown in. And, as stupid as TMR gets at times, it's worth it's weight in Egyptian artifacts of pure gold!Then there's what I call it's Sinbad Effect (The storybook sailor, not the comedian). Those wonderfully campy, velveeta cheesy characters just too fake to believe. Even with the state of the art computer gizmos of our era attempting to make it all look real, it doesn't work. Which makes it all the more endearing. The best example is the Scorpion King himself with his colossal Sindbad-esque, 1/2 man 1/2 scorpion body, that willl have the slightest of arachnaphobes sweating profusely in their theater seats. Shudder. The Mummy Returns story goes... The O'Connells, an archaeologist (Rachel Weitz) and ex-bandit (Brendan -steaming hot- Frasor) , who met in the last movie, have bred. They now include an adorable, precociuos 8 year old son, named Alex (Fred Boath). The happy family is excavating at a site, in deepest Egypt, thought to hold the long deceased Scorpion King's golden bracelet, which in turn commands the underworld Army of Anubis. The bracelet is extremely gaudy, in a WWF accessory looking way, but, he who possesses the trinket can call uon these minions and overtake the world. Armageddon.Why not just let it be? Stay buried in it's sandy grave for the next 5000 years? Ah, well, Mrs. Evi O' Connell has been obsessed, suddenly, with finding it. She's been riddled in her dreams. Fed vivid images of a past life and an insider's knowledge of the evil bracelet's hiding place.Now, the O'Connells are quite awake and just centimeters from that hiding place.Just down the road, in the Valley of the Dead, we find shady characters unearthing everyone's favorite evil priest, Imhotep from his grave (Well, from an Alien prop the producers got at cost at the Universal auction, at least!). Hollywood, never ones to let popular characters go, has managed to resurrect the menacing half-fleshed- twice dead-already-original- movie-mummy, Mr. Imhotep (sexy, smoky, South African Arnold Vasloo). He appears, as do many familiar returning characters, as we weave and scurry like a wounded scorpion ourselves toward the entangled plot.Imhotep is greeted by another old cast member, Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Velazquez). She is his soulmate mistress and his Pharaoh's murderous wife. Ankie has been reincarnated to serve him. Immie whines immediately. Seems she's Anck-Su-Namun Aramalamadingdong in body, but not in soul, and he will pull her soul from hell so their love can once again rule the world....Isn't it romantic?Of course, Imhotep needs that Scorpion King's bracelet to lead him to The Scorpion King's Golden Pyramid, and awaken / rule the Army of Darkness, oops, I mean Army of Anubis! So, off he, and his merry band of cutthroat followers, go. They head straight to the O'Connell's, who just happen to have returned to London with the infamous bracelet, and, even though they've been pretty much in this very scene before, are dumbfounded as to what it all means.Their young son Alex, playing arround in the antiquities, accidentally gets the bracelet stuck on his arm. The bracelet wastes no time in showing it's magical powers to the lad. It begins by pointing out various Egyptian landmarks like some beyond- the-grave holographic viewmaster.Whoops! The child and his golden trinket have been grabbed by Mrs. Imhotep and the assisting bad guys! The chase is on!Their old, holy friend, Ardeth Bay (Oded - handsome in a manly, swarthy way - Fehr), joins in the pursuit, and we travel from ruin to ruin with the O'Connell clan always one step behind the kidnappers and Imhotep's world domination!We are never explained why we have to make this bizarre multi-ruin excursion across Egypt. First to Karnac then to Hamunaptra. For some reason the Scorpion's all-telling bracelet will only show one stop at a time. Can you say plot stretching? Who cares, it's fun!Did I forget to mention the young O'Connell, Alex, has been informed by the helpful Imhotep that the pretty gold bracelet on his arm plans on sucking the life out of his little body if he doesn't get into the SK's Golden Pyramid by sun up on the 7th day? Ultimately, both parties, nearly simultanously, arrive at the Oasis of Pygmies upon the 6th day at dusk. Here they find the illusive Scorpion King's Golden Pyramid. Ah, but getting throught the Oasis isn't going to be so easy. There's these creepy pygmy guards that attack in a bloody frenzy to deal with first!Tension's on... Will Alex make it into the pyramid by sun up? Can the O'Connells stop Imhotep and the army of darkness, er, Anubis from overtaking the Earth? Is the Scorpion King even in this? Will Imhotep and Anck-Su-Namun settle in a small westside pyramid for two and have a little mummy of their own? And, most importantly, Will Brendan Fraser keep aging this beautifully?Some of TMR's scenes actually had me laughing out loud - not where the screenwriter had planned, I'm sure! For one, the evil Scorpion King's army, resurrected from the grave, looked like rabid greyhounds. Even at seven feet tall they looked high-strung and wimpy. Reminiscent of the silly feminine storm troopers in Star Wars Episode One. Just hysterical!And those horrid little Muppet-esque 'guards' of the Scorpion King's Golden Pyramid - the pygmies. They were just stoopid! It's not humiliating enough to this would-be world dominator, The Scorpion King, that he's half arachnid, but he's got to have these bazillion evil Muppets guarding his tomb? I bet he's got 'Imhotep Evil Army' envy! TMR is what it is. One of those great summer movies filled with a swashbuckling leading man, a sassy gal pal, a precocious offspring and a barrage of really mean bad guys that you can cheer on as they are inevitably crushed in brilliantly, if redundant, choreographed fight scenes by our heroes.Just be ready, there are so many leading characters and such a deeply woven storyline, intermingled with fancy Egyptian words, that, at times, you'll be lead so far off the camel trail, you may forget why you had to stop in Hamunaptra or Karnac enroute to the Pigmy Oasis.This ain't your mommy's Mummy movie! It's nice to sit back and be transported to a world of make believe once in a while. The Mummy Returns did just that. This is not a serious FILM; it is a movie and a darned good one at that. Walk like an Egyptian and go see it. Yah-la!",Null,0,0,3 May 2001
Enemy at the Gates," The story, while entertaining at times, is long and just not intriguing enough to keep you enthralled.
","Right from the get go Enemy had a few flaws...First and fore most is the way the cast speaks. Pure and proper British. Sure the two leads are British (Law and Fiennes) but, um, they play Russians...Fighting Germans...Very distracting. Compounded by the fact the Russian uniforms (though I am certainly no scholar on war fashions) were this kucka brown/green similar to the Brits. So quite often you were put in a mind twist when they suddenly showed newspapers, graffiti etc. in Russian..' Your mind would quickly check its self-'Oh, yeah, it's Stalingrad, not London, right.'What the actors couldn't manage a few lessons with an accent specialist? Can you even imagine Schindler's List with proper British accents? No. Of course not.EATG's story goes...It's WW2. The Russian moral is low. They are losing thousands to the Germans daily. What they need is an all-Ruskie-common-man hero.Soviet yuppie, and journalist, Danilov (Joe ' Please leave Ralph out of this!' Fiennes) thinks his friend sniper Vassili (Jude ' Cherub faced' Law) would be just the comrade for the troupes and people of the Soviet to adore.They begin a campaign. Real propaganda filled pro-Russian hype. The Germans get quite annoyed as this hero-sniper offs more and more Germans to the glee of the Russian people. They decide to send in their top sniper to wipe out their top sniper. A real hard ball game of Risk.The Nazi they send is Mjr. Koenig (Ed - looking quite sharp all nazied up- Harris).Meanwhile, love's sniper, mythical Cupid hits both Danilov and Vassili's heart with a sharp arrow pointed straight at local peasant turned soldier, Tania ( Rachel Weisz). Will this be the ruin of the two? Can their friendship sustain the interference of penis envy? Will Mjr. Koening get his man?EATG tries so hard to pull at your heartstrings.The acting is absolutely the draw here. Rock solid. But the story, while entertaining at times, is long and just not intriguing enough to keep you enthralled.The Fiennes family is a talented lot. You've got ultra handsome tenderloin of manbeef Ralph, sister Martha a film director, another brother a musician, yet another a gamekeeper, etc...And the matriarch was (as she's sadly passed) a free spirited soul and author, Jini. Then there's little Joey. He's not as swell on the retina as Bro. Ralphie but he's holding his own. He's as intense as his grossly thespian sibling, granted, and proving he too can titillate with theatrical orations worthy of your movie ticket fee.His costar, Jude Law, is such a manfest powerhouse it only strengthens Fiennes' performance. Even in a light hearted casually elegant little role like The Talented Mr. Ripley, or as a trashy and quickly disposed of manboytoy, as in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Law manages to steal a bit of his better known costars glimmer and momentarily take some of the glow for himself. His flawless job as lead here in Enemy at the Gates may just catch him his own well-deserved little shooting star.
If your a fan of any the cast, see this just for the stellar performances they cast onto celluloid with albeit moronic accent that repeatedly throws your suspension of disbelief. But don't expect another wartime epic worthy of multiple viewing...Say an English Patient or Saving Private Ryan period piece with soul and girth. It's the two handsome leads alone that even makes this watchable, once.Girly Note: You may want to pack your MPK (movie puke bag) if you decide to see this...the 'love' scene is filthy-literally. You are less interested in their lovemaking techniques, than you are worried about the kind of infections those dirty exploring fingers could cause. Yech. Hardly erotic.Snack recommendation: sturgeon, caviar and vodka-natchStarring: Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes, Ed Harris, Rachel Weisz and a sore infested Bob Hoskins.",Null,0,0,17 March 2001
A Beautiful Mind," There's no mathematical equation that can produce the number of stars this film deserves; it's infinite.
","A Beautiful Mind is as complex as its subject, Nobel Prize winner Dr. John Nash; it's a funny romantic thriller, high in drama. Russell Crowe is mesmerizing (per usual) and disappears into the role as he does each time he graces his screen.It's a new year at Princeton 1947 and all the young minds of the future are chomping at the bit to be the next Einstein. There we find a fun group of genius' and one smarty pants is even 'more' genius than the rest, John Nash (Russell-TOFOG- Crowe). Nash is a bit of an oddball and doesn't mince words with frilly superfluous adjectives. In fact he says precisely what ever his mind calculates as fact without editing. Hence he comes off a tad rude and uncaring and he's no hit with the gals, guys, or common types that wander in and out of his life. He's as socially defunct as he is brilliant.His Princeton nemesis, Hansen (Josh Lucas), is nearly as 'good' as him, and is headed for the position Nash had favored himself. Unless he can come up with something totally new, and hit the world upside the head with his astute theories. He does it is now known (and utilized) as equilibria in the theory of non-cooperative games. There's no layman's terms to that, really, just think games without set rules and you'll be close. With his simple idea, he revolutionized economics,globally, and refutes the long accepted ideas of economic genius Adam Smith. Professional success is his.Then the government comes to him and asks if he can help them decode some ominous codes they've intercepted. He does. His mind, which is cracker jack fast, is able to crack the code fast as an eggshell cracks- and that's pretty fast- Jack. This attracts a secret agent type, Mr. Parcher (Ed ' I played POLLOCK the artist not Pollack the fish!- Harris) who solicits even more secret assistance from the volatile Mr. Nash.Nash is given top-secret clearance and put to work, finding secret messages the commies have planted in our magazines.As his governmental extra curriculum begins so does a new phenomenon for the platonic genius. He meets a smart and beautiful gal named Alicia (Jennifer -classic beauty-Connelly) and as quickly as mercury is drawn up with temperature Nash falls head over quantum physics in love.Meanwhile his government contact, Mr. Parcher, informs him the soviets may be on to him and there may be repercussions for he and his new bride. When Nash is shot at while meeting with Mr. Parcher the mental pressure, which is tremendous, starts to take effect. Nash is breaking down faster than an equation in a room full of mathematicians!I don't want to give away the storyThat's all you get. GO SEE THIS!
It appears director Ron Howard has started a traditioneach year right before the holidays he brings us an exceptional gift of a wonderful film. Last year's Grinch, and this year he tops that tenfold with this sensation, A Beautiful Mind. Bravo! His direction takes a sterling cast, and a brilliantly clever script and creates a masterpiece. Scenes are elegantly stitched together like an Armani suit draped upon an Oscar bound actorBeautiful Jennifer Connelly lit up the scenes she shared with her star, and not just held her own, but also stole a bit of Crowe's glow. What a talented actor she is. Jennifer is no new comer though folks! Her stunningly realistic portrayal of a junkie in Requiem For A Dream got her a coveted nomination for the prestigious Spirit Award. She was also in the hit sleeper Pollock.. Speaking of Pollock, its star and director Ed Harris plays his shady government agent Mr. Parcher, with the slither he's so famous for; smooth as a properly crusted Crème Brule.Paul Bettany ( who basically carried any frame of savable celluloid from that god-awful A Knight's Tale fiasco last summer on his broad lanky shoulders) is wonderful as Nash's best friend, roommate and confidant Charles Herman. I've loved this guy the first time I had the pleasure of seeing him perform. Though we know him here for his continuing comic roles, he's actually Mr. Shakespeare back in the Queen's land.
When you see and hear Russell Crowe (see n.male adj.manly v.to drool in the dictionary) as Nash complete with a quirky West Virginia accent, an odd over-bite and a goofydoodle haircut, you'll almost forgets this manly actor sexed up the screen as a macho hard bodied pheromone projecting studmuffin in Gladiator- almost. Those familiar with Crowe's works know he loves a role that gives him a challenge. It seems to be a kind of Rugby match 'tween the screen with him. Whether he's adding pounds and years to fight evil cigarette companies (The Insider) or leading clueless neo-Nazis to battle against erroneous enemies (Romper Stomper), he devours a role and spits out perfection. He's more than a beautiful body, he's a brilliant mind. I've told Santa I'm not a greedy little girl all I want for Christmas this year is a little Crowe. A 195 pound one named Russell! Gosh is this man gorgeous! I'd like to dip his entire naked being in strawberry whip cream and well, er, umsorry.A Beautiful Mind is by far the best thing I've seen in a year. The Shipping News, with mega-talented cuteyufalagus Kevin Spacey opens in a couple weeks as well as Ali with chocolate sensation Wil Smith, and of course Mr. Ego (Tom Cruise) opens with Vanilla Sky, but for now, the Best Actor Oscar at the 74th annual Academy Awards may as well be cast with Crowe's name in it - it's his!Snack Recommendation: Slow roasted Kiwi Crowe dipped in Strawberry flavored whip cream ...",Null,0,1,13 December 2001
Shrek," Shrek is by far the cutest and smartest animated film since Pixar
","Shrek is by far the cutest and smartest animated film since Pixar made their name with A Bug's Life and The Toy Stories. The characters are so 3 dimensional you forget you're watching painted digital creatures thought up by animation wizards.The celebrity cast, here just voices behind the delightful celluloid images, are perfect reflections of their cartoon counterparts. Each character is continually witty without being overtly cynical. The punch lines, that number in the thousands, are often unpredictable and slap- your- knee clever. Finally, a movie for the whole family.Shrek's rating is PG but this treasure is pretty much a free for all. The PG rating is given for it's teensy bit of gross humor; eyeball eating, the slurping of a slug or two and a bit of clean-ish sexual innuendos meant for the 'knowing' adults that will fly right over the kid's little cartoon admiring heads. Don't worry, unless you're a card-carrying neurotic that thinks TV or Brittany Spears is the route of all evil yadda, yadda, yadda ...Shrek's just fine.Shrek's story goes...Shrek (Mike Myers' voice is an ogre. You remember from the fairytales? Those big unruly fiends with Troll-like appendages, always hell-bent on mischievous mayhem and excessive drooling while devouring the poor innocent village folks? Yeah. This ogre's a little different. He lives in a peaceful swamp and minds his own beeswax, far from the village troublemaker.Until the ruler of his land, Prince Farquard orders all the fairytale characters residing in his hamlet be banished to his (Shrek's) humble, quiet, swamp.This will not do! Normally a social shut-in, Shrek finds himself besieged with unwanted overly happy- singing- rhyming guests. None more annoying then a talkative donkey who had originally escaped the prince's demands and had found Shrek along the road, and kind of juststayed.Shrek's a wreck. People, er, fairy tale creatures, and fairy tale animals are everywhere. The wolf from Little Red Riding Hood is in his bed smoking a cigar, the Seven Dwarfs store Snowy's casket-like perma-a-porta-boudoir on Shrek's dinner table, the Three Blind Mice run about breaking things with their guide sticks and chomping on his ear while the rest of the bedtime gang is gathered- camped- right in his front yard!There's nothing else to do. Shrek must go forth and make the prince reverse his orders and remove the cast of delinquent misfits that list like the usual suspects in a Grimm's tale or Old Mother Hubbard.Shrek doesn't know where the nasty prince lives. He needs help. Hmm. That annoying little donkey that won't leave knows where the prince is. Shrek grudgingly agrees to him playing escort.The little donkey is a handful for Shrek, who is use to no-one. The donkey is a jabber jaw, a rapid-fire conversationalist that babbles on endlessly about next to nothing.- Lucky for us he's given his vocal orations by Eddy Murphy, one of our finest living comedians. Eddie's just brilliant as the wisecracking, phobia-filled, intruding little mule.Together, Shrek and the little donkey, get an audience with his lord, with the prince.Prince Farquaad (John Lithgow who's voice naturally sounds a bit snobby--he's the leader from Third Rock From the Sun) is far from receptive. However, he sees a use for the odd duo, which serves his wants and needs. He agrees to return the land to the ogre, imp free, if he'll take on a brief mission. Faquuad wants them to fetch his queen to be. The woman whom he has chosen to be his bride, thusly catapulting the idiot to king status by way of marriage. DinkOff, again, Shrek and the little Donkey go. Their adventures to and from the bride's land are very entertaining. The tale refreshing even if we (adults) all know whom, what, and when within a half of an hour. This fairy tale is more like those old Fractured Fairy Tales of days past. Just off enough to keep adults hooting and just innocent enough and chock full of righteous morals to keep the kiddies mesmerized for a couple of cry-freehours.The bi-partisan cast keeps us giddy with giggles and happy as hobbitts right to its ending. Enjoy!",Null,6,15,26 May 2001
Rock Star," So you wanna be a rock star? Who doesn't?
","So you wanna be a rock star? Who doesn't? Cool clothes, hot babes (or mansteaks depending upon your preference) and world travel. These days one barely needs talent...The cast within Rocks Star both the musicians and the actors playing musicians just don't have any oomph. It's hard for me not to love Mark Wahlberg, though.Marky Wahlberg is not only one of the cutest croissants in the bakery of man, but he's a wonderful actor. His soft-spoken, near bookish demeanor and hard crusty bits mix in a large portion of talent perfection cocktail. Sure, I'm smitten, but it's the truth. This is one of his most humorous roles yet.Jennifer Aniston is still trying to break out of her Friend's mold. She hasn't done it here, unfortunately. Her role, as Chris (Izzy)'s girlfriend could have been played by just about any starlet wondering the lot. Maybe next time she'll get some meat and dumplings to sink her perfectly shaped teeth into? It's hard to get out of the whole must see TV stuff.
Rock Star is a comedy, not a brilliant comedy, that follows the rise of Chris Cole. He's a lead singer for a cover/tribute band, Blood Pollution that drives the locals into frenzy while they emulate a real, famous, rock band Steel Dragon ; like all those tribute bands of the Grateful Dead or the Doors do even now at local dive venues to a screaming B class groupies yellin' over a quazi-karaoke night.The year is 1985, big hair, tacky clothes and cucumber bulges rule, and so does metal. Chris is very much a part of the scene. He's a semi loser during the day, drives a beat up Dart, and lives at home- 'nough said?
When Christopher's unceremoniously booted from the band he lives for he's thinking life's pretty much a big old bag of rag weed you paid a premium for. That is until his phone rings and fate steps up to his microphone. He's asked to step-in for the Steel Dragon's singer, Bobby Beers (Jason Flemyng), ala the real life switch-a-roo Judas Priest pulled with leather boy, Rob Halford...Chris has suddenly become the icon people in bands around the world look to be. Neat huh? But he wants more. Snore. Chris, now known as Izzy, does the whole Mick Jagger-Bowie-Poison gig and is livin the generic rock star life of legends...all while as his gal, who was always his strongest supporter, (sniff) Emily (Jennifer ' I see Brad Pitt naked -anytime I want' Aniston) is starting to be lost in the fog machine of life.He's rude, crude, whoring around and into drug food. She's gotta dump the creep. Oh, how quickly people forget who was there when they were beggin' for change to fill up their gas tank...He gets his ego bruised a little to though... hehehe (<-evil cackle)Rock Star's problem? There's a lack of edge, no real energy of the 'time' is present, and few belly laughs await you, dare I say it's a Spinal Tap lite? Granted Rock Star has some great scenes, some decent acting and lots of young hot bucks in tight clothing wriggling about a stage and scantly clad felines for all the audience to enjoy. Remember Mark 'the actor' Wahlberg was once an underwear exposing hip-hop artist ricocheting around a stage in his Calvins, grabbing his crotch to sound of screaming girls simultaneously in prayer that his stylin' oversized jeans would plummet to the floor and reveal his winky. While Rock Star's music is other end of the jukebox different, Wahlberg's had the rock star experience and he does a great (I just think it could have been even better) job of bring Chris up to a quazi-believable star. Mark did provide less of a lypsyncing-local-talent-show impersonation and managed to capture an essence of what schmoo turned icon would be reacting like. The movie itself just didn't grab you.The band Steel Dragons actually boasts real musicians with a bit of a name for themselves; the drummer is the real Jason Bonham (son of Led Zeppelin's John Bonham -second only to Moon in talent), the bassist is Dokken's guitarist Jeff Pilson, and Third Eye Blind's lead singer, Stephan Jenkins plays a rival bands lead singer. So there's tasty treats for the diehard music folks sprinkled in the audience.Often I thought of Spinal Tap, the quintessential rock star mock and wishes for Nigel (Christopher Guest) to pop up backstage arguing about finger sandwiches and the evils of bread crust...it never happened.In the end , Rock Star is a big old metaphor for how important it is to be yourself. To find your own voice. Sure Chris/Izzy's made it big, filling the shoes of Steel Dragon's ex-singer. Somebody who already paved the road, so the fans aren't really gushing over Chris at all. That's gonna effect your psyche eventually huh? He's an artist after all...Rock Star is also a chance for some rock and roll nostalgia. Not just for the fond memory of the ridiculously made-up boys of the eighties, but for those shapely men in their super tight custom leather performing a kind of bare chested ballet to screaming guitars and half hour long drum riffs. If your one of them rush and see this...if not wait for rental.Snack recommendation: Beer and donuts, while reviewing Boogie Nights just one more time...",Null,1,2,5 September 2001
