The Ring," A thrill ride....no fantastic
","The Ring is ultimately one of the greatest movies of all time. Or ultimateley one of the greatest horro movies of all time. Although there could've been things that could be better there was in fact nothing that could've been better about this film other than the fact that the Japanese original is fantastically much more horrorifying, although American adaptions generally are terrible, this was quite close to the original and was good.Although many may not agree, the most terrifying part was in fact the bit where Sadako, no I mean Samara came out of the television. It was extremely well shot and to be honest with you. the make up on Samara was better than when Sadako came out of the television.It was excellent, and it is my movie now!",Null,0,0,17 November 2002
