Sucker Punch," Get Sucker Punched! You'll Awaken Anew! =D =)
","The first movie of the year for me indeed was nothing short of superb! =D Feel upon this movie on a whim as I happened to see an advertisement on YouTube showcasing 'Now Playing!' just yesterday what I was calling 'Something Saturday!' Indeed, Alice In Wonderland (2010) meets Hero (2002) interlocking with cousin ties in-theme of The Shawshank Redemption (1994) mixing pleasantly with Foxfire (1996) in order to create a cinematic masterpiece with body that would convert an army of anguish to pacifist promising monks. Sexy; Stunning; Cunning and honest to potentially understanding better the unseen purpose beyond what eyes see--this love-life-even-in-the-realms-of-fantasy-becomes-sanity truly has an air and aura that does share the best lessons and ideals of both Seven Pounds (2008) and Braveheart (1995)--but you will want to 'look for it' to 'find it'--that is... 'The Fifth Element.' (1997)It is You. ^_^ Or at least UP to You. =3For those simply seeing 'Sexy School Girls,' 'Dancing Temptresses' and 'Battle-Babe-Female-Fatales' in this fabulous flick are sincerely victim of this film's title TOTALLY... Sucker Punch(ed). =3 For those who realize and recognize that in order for our initial protagonist to deal with the insanity of her reality--she turns to the sanity of her fantasies in a true Pan's Labyrinth (2006) or Bridge To Terabithia (2007) fashion. =3 Certainly not half-as-child-or-youth friendly as Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion The Witch & The Wardrobe (2005) nor quite the cinematic renditions of Harry Potter--this seriously themed film portraying a love that may not easily be understood by those seeking quick answers -- is a thrill ride WELL worth getting a ticket to experience! Not only is the cast (female and male characters alike) absolutely gorgeous and well portrayed--but the allegory of what the cast stands for in a series of realities (an allegory ala'mode not unlike The Fountain (2005)) involving a 'Through The Looking Glass' (1841) perspective for in-looking spectators in the outside realm. Indeed, the complexity in my humble opinion is truly where this film remains strong in keeping an idea essentially simplistic. The protagonist, we simply know as 'Baby' truly to me is well portrayed as are her thoughts as a 'Living Fantasy.' It is made clear early on that what we are going to see is the 'Feelings' of our protagonist shared through her 'Series of Worlds' which will take on forms that in my humble opinion the modern 'Digital Native' or 'Millennium/Dotcom' should be able to relate. man and woman. (Certainly a film that is homage to the 'Rumiko Takahashi' 'Stan Lee' 'J.K. Rowling' 'J.R. Tolkien' 'Walt Disney,' 'Spike + Stan Lee' types of our world. I personally and instantly thought, 'This is Baby's version of my Angel Arc Universe.' ^_^)Indeed even though there are those in the crowd of existence who may view this movie and wonder 'where is this GOING!?' or even as one young lady put it after completing this film, 'So it's like 90 percent of the movie didn't even happen.' Such shallow views will indeed keep one from drawing in the full and soul-enriching message of this film. The world is essentially what we make it. Although a far cry from being even remotely as humorous or upbeat and lighthearted as the awesome Mike Judge film and story shared in The Invention of Lying (2009) or as sci-fi of similes a James Cameron's Avatar (2009) -- Snyder's & Shibuya's Sucker Punch answers a potential reason to do, shape, create, craft or share anything: Love.The Jesus Christ Superstar (1973) style of character does seem to get a great deal of 'Story Play' in our world it would seem. From Joan of Arc (1999) to Socrates (1971) to Gandhi (1982) to Martin Luther King, Jr. (1929-1968) and John F. Kennedy (1917-1963) this side of Reality. From 'Earth-Saving-Mecha-Pilots Takaya and Amano' in the Hideki Anno anime Aim For The Top! Gunbuster to 'Human-Eating-Monster-Fighter-and-Driver Francis Lawrence in I Am Legend (2007) to 'Space-Traveling-Daddy Harry Stamper' in the film Armageddon (1998)... there just seems to be a magnetic attraction to those who are capable of caring beyond the self for a larger cause. This film's theme ends no different. And although there are those who may dislike the closing 'Progressive End' made from a decision of 'Love In The Purest Form' (honest platonic care about a 'Purpose' which includes a scope and understanding beyond the self) -- to me... there certainly is no less a fitting end to such a tragic story. Essentially -- the end is fitting. Things get better. Things get worse. Things balance out. Things fall out of balance (towards positive or negative). Things return to balance and change... remains the only true constant or 'same.'Indeed how such change affects each individual is up to the individual. Indeed wherever we intrinsically reside is 'where we are' at any given Point-In-Time.Change takes place and form according to the individual viewing 'Through The Looking Glass.' Perspective Per Person defines Purpose. Purpose is found within one person and that person is...You.Forever In Love With All That Which Exists (That Which Is Seen & Unseen, Known & Unknown), -Tiger M. Gales (Maybe!
