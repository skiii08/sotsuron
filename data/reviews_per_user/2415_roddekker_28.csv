Vertigo," Alfred Hitchcock's Pre-'Psycho' Psycho
","Vertigo has got to be one of the most absurd and disturbing movies about men and their 'modern-day' mental illnesses that I have ever seen. It's true.The mental illness that I'm talking about here is, of course - Men's totally twisted and fanatical obsession about having complete and absolute control over women.You know, I'd say that when it comes to one of Hitchcock's most psychotic 'movie-psychos' of all-time - Scottie Ferguson here in Vertigo makes Norman Bates from Psycho look, by comparison, as if he were 'normal', yes, NORMAL. I mean, Scottie was one really whacked-out maniac, that's for sure! Personally, I think that director Alfred Hitchcock went way too far out on a shaky limb with this one. And, being way out there, he ended up losing his balance and, literally, getting 'vertigo', himself. This film is nothing but a bird's eye view of a supremely grotesque freak show with Scottie (representing the average American psycho, I mean, the average American male) as the main monster of attraction.At a running time of 130 minutes, Vertigo really only begins to pick up steam in the last 30 minutes. The first 100 minutes of it is just endlessly drawn out 'build-up', extremely drab, most of it.",4,20,33,23 May 2015
Sucker Punch," A Scuzzy, Whorehouse Mentality Prevails Throughout
","With its scuzzy, whorehouse mentality (which prevails throughout) and its headache-inducing, CG, fantasy sequences - I'm completely convinced that Sucker Punch is nothing more than a heap of empty-headed trash that could only appeal to those who are.... (how you say?).... 'mentally-unhinged'.Given a title that never explains itself - Sucker Punch certainly proved to me what a low, rock-bottom opinion director Zack Snyder holds for the intelligence of his audience. Yeah. Snyder must truly loathe his audience something fierce to offer up this crock of 'you-know-what' as his idea of worthwhile entertainment.And - If that wasn't annoying enough as it is - I can't seem to recall any other movie that I've seen in the past that has shown more disdainful contempt and outright derision, for both men and women, as does the likes of Sucker Punch.All-in-all - This $82 million fiasco production repeatedly scraped the absolute bottom of the barrel on all counts.",1,6,17,13 February 2016
The Ring," You Die In 7 Days!
","Though I haven't yet seen 1998's 'Ringu' (from Japan) - I certainly thought that 2002's 'The Ring' (which was its American remake) was (as far as modern-day ghost stories go) a satisfyingly eerie tale of the supernatural. This film actually produced some very real and powerful chills without having to resort to grinding excessive, bloody gore into my face.Featuring plenty of ghostly images to frighten the viewer, royally - Along with a mellow flow of hypnotically haunting music (composed by Hans Zimmer) to set the mood - 'The Ring' certainly didn't let me down at all as its story went deep into an investigation into the deaths of those who had viewed a mysterious video tape.Impressively directed by Gore Verbinski - There was definitely no question in my mind that this talented movie-maker understood the genre of film that he was working with, completely.For me, 'The Ring' was a real 'gem-of-a-fright-flick' whose spooky images and scary story-line actually stayed with me long after the whole horror-show was over.",7,4,5,9 October 2016
Kung Fu Panda," Gimme Winnie The Pooh, Any Day
","OK. I shall keep this short, and sweet (?).There's no 'Ifs', 'Ands', or 'Buts' about it - Kung Fu Panda stank.I hated, absolutely hated, Po the Panda. (It should have been 'Poop' the Panda!) It really figures that Po's voice belonged to that totally unfunny nincompoop, Jack Black.As far as 'so-called' light-hearted, family entertainment goes - Kung Fu Panda, on a whole, was flat, uninspired, predictable, empty-headed, and utterly stupid.Yes - You, of course, may not agree with what I've said here. And, hey, that's OK. But do keep in mind, this movie really irked me off, especially for the time that I wasted watching it. And, at this point, I think that I've made myself quite clear and I shouldn't feel the need to explain the 'why' of every single statement that I've made.",1,3,15,22 May 2015
The Hunger Games," Anorexia Nervosa Joins The Hunger Games
","The only thing good about this movie was that it finally ended.Welcome to The Hunger Games where a selected group of completely innocent children (one of which was only about 10) are literally forced to fight each other right to the very death.The ruling class is totally thrilled by these games, while the poor families watch the live, televised broadcast in hopes that their child will come out of this horrible ordeal alive.As the audience we are thoughtlessly thrown into the middle of this confused scenario without any explanation as to just how a human society managed to degrade itself to such a pathetic level as this, which clearly makes the ancient gladiator games look almost innocent by comparison.All we know is that there was a war and in order to maintain peace The Hunger Games were introduced to serve mainly as intimidation by the arrogant ruling class, but, also, sadly enough, they serve as a form of 'American Idol'-type entertainment, as well.Over-hyped.... Over-long..... Over nothing!",2,5,7,3 January 2015
Taxi Driver," Beep! Beep! Honk! Honk!
","I don't get it. I really don't. (And, I guess I never will) Why does this dreary, dead-end movie from the dreary, dead-end 1970s seem to rate so high with so many people? I can't, for the life of me, see how these people would give this certified dud 8 & 10-star ratings.I mean, Taxi Driver's story was less than interesting. There wasn't a single likable character in the whole lot of these NYC losers. The directing was, for the most part, very amateurish and inconsistent. And the violence was, at times, almost laughable.This, to me, was not in any way a satisfying movie-experience, yet people seem to, literally, fall all over themselves, heaping unwarranted praise on it.Personally, I think that most of these people who love Taxi Driver to pieces are probably now in their 50s and 60s.These people saw this film when it was first released in movie theaters back in 1976. And due to a sense of blind-nostalgia they continue to perceive this movie through rose-colored glasses. And, with that, there's absolutely nothing anyone can say that can shake that almost-senile sentimentality out of their little heads.",1,72,121,2 May 2015
Romeo + Juliet," Shakespeare Must Be Turning In His Grave
","I've just finished watching this film and I can't believe what a terrible Juliet that Claire Danes made. Not only could Danes not act the part, but she also didn't look the part, either.For me, Juliet was supposed to be an exceptionally attractive girl, who was literally brimming over with charm, intelligence and sexual appeal. Well, Claire Danes possessed none of these qualities. In fact, I found her to be so ugly and repulsive (both in looks and manner), that every time she made a screen appearance I would find myself laughing out loud at the downright absurdity of her being cast in a role that was so far out of her league.And to think that Romeo (who really wasn't that much better in the looks department, either) would be so blind as to fall head-over-heels in love with such a dull and dog-faced girl as this, and that he was actually willing to die for her, too. Ridiculous!",4,3,5,29 January 2017
Nightcrawler," Creepy Nightcrawler, Lou Bloom, Made My Skin Crawl (Yech!)
","Nightcrawler has got to be one of the most callous and black-hearted stories about finding employment that I have ever seen.Was this movie's story really encouraging the unemployed viewer to go after the job of their dreams regardless of how many others had to be hurt (and even killed) for them to obtain it? What inevitably made Nightcrawler even worse than I had ever imagined it could be was that this particular, snot-nosed 'nightcrawler' (who was just 34 years old) was actually lusting after a 60-year-old woman (which made her old enough to be his mother).And, I guess that's what little, boy Bloom needed the most - A mother.I do not understand why so many people are raving about and giving Nightcrawler such high praise and 8-star ratings.Could it be possible that they actually find themselves identifying with the Lou Bloom character?..... If this is so then, I, for one, think that is an utterly pathetic statement about this new, lost generation of today.",1,10,38,30 August 2015
Oblivion," I Was Left Oblivious To 'Oblivion'
","Of course, with a $120 million budget to its credit, how could Oblivion not look all pretty and sparkling for the viewer? I mean, Oblivion certainly was a dazzling sight for the eyes.So, if you watch Oblivion solely for its multi-million dollar visual effects, then I'm certain that you won't be in the least bit disappointed.But if you are hoping and expecting to be impressed with an intelligent storyline, then, face it, you are definitely in for a major let-down. Oblivion's story, pretty much, came down to being nothing more than poorly recycled nonsense that's been ripped off from just about every other Sci-Fi/Action film from the last 30 years, or so.And speaking about the likes of Tom Cruise - I think it's about time for this talentless, little pretty-boy to retire from show biz and go join all of his self-righteous brethren in Scientology heaven.",3,0,1,28 April 2015
28 Weeks Later," Bite-Bite-Bite-Bite-Bite-Bite-Bite-Bite!
","OK. This 2007, big-budget, zombie movie certainly did have its fair share of good points, as well as its share of bad points, too.On the plus side - I thought that the 'run-for-your-life' panic which prevailed (when the 'Rage-Virus' zombies were literally biting everyone and anyone that they could during the all-out zombie attack) was handled very well. The heart-pounding terror (as it escalated into a frenzied 'Code Red' situation) really progressed quite nicely and became a very satisfying adrenaline rush.And, on top of that - The excellent, rapid-fire editing, along with the often-haunting soundtrack music, all added up to a number of very riveting horror-movie moments.But, on the down side - Not only did I get pretty fed up with the entire combat unit (who were all just a bunch of predictable, garden-variety jocks) - But when Tammy and Andy Doyle deliberately sneaked away from 'District One' and entered into the restricted zone (where all hell suddenly broke loose), I thought that this whole business weakened 28 Weeks Later's story-line considerably and lost it some significant points.And, finally - The one thing that really puzzled me about 'Rage-Virus' was - Why were the infected ones not biting other animals (and then these creatures, in turn, would become infected biters, as well)?",5,3,5,26 June 2015
The Shining," One Of The Dullest 'Shinings' Ever
","Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining' has got to be one of the all-time worst big-budget horror films ever made. Everything about The Shining said 'expensive', but nothing about it said 'scary'.It truly baffles me that such an impressive director as Stanley Kubrick would ever consider tackling the mess of a typical Stephen King horror novel and try to adapt it to the screen.All-in-all - The Shining was a dud. There was only one murder in it, which, in my opinion, was a completely unforgivable body-count when it comes to any horror film.Two of the biggest strikes against this film were the casting of that goofus, Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance and having that pudding-faced kid, Danny Lloyd, as Torrance's brat son, Danny.",3,5,15,1 March 2015
The Exorcist," An Unconvincing Demon Possession
","Aside from the intentionally disturbing nature of this film, I find this story about a 'possessed' girl to be somewhat confused and half-baked. Well, what could I expect? The makers of The Exorcist certainly weren't aiming for plausibility here. No. Their goal was to gross the audience out like it had never been grossed out before and make a huge pile of money doing it. I'm sure we'd all agree that they succeeded very well on both counts.As far as Reagan's 'possession' goes, I think it was a really screwy one and kinda wimpy, too.To begin with, since she seemed to be fortified with an incredible amount of physical power, this left me wondering why the hell she would allow herself to be confined, like a prisoner, to her own bedroom. I would think that whatever it was that was possessing her would be itching to go out on the town and, you know, turn a few heads around on Main Street, or something wickedly-fun like that. But none of this kinda thing happened. There were no aborted escape attempts, either.All-in-all, it was a kind of stupid 'demon'. Boring and unadventurous, if you ask me. But apparently Reagan did get out once (or did she?) to desecrate the virgin Mary icon in the church. And her desecration was so artistically done, too. It was an amazing piece of art work for a mere 12 year old whose previous examples of clay figures were lumpy turtles and the likes.",5,10,21,10 May 2015
Alice in Wonderland," How To Ruin A Classic Fairy Tale
","Why-Oh-Why did Director Tim Burton have to go and get his grubby, little (Edward Scissor) hands on the story of Alice In Wonderland? The way I see it, Burton almost single-handedly succeeded in totally trashing this unique and unusual fairy tale by turning it into yet another one of his typically terrible, little freak shows.Unlike the 1951 animated version of this same story, where the characters were basically charming, likable and memorable, Burton's offering gives us characters that are really quite the opposite.In my opinion, Burton's remaking of Alice In Wonderland is about the same thing as if Rob Zombie were to go ahead and remake Burton's 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure', or something to that effect.Johnny Depp is another reason for my disliking Alice In Wonderland. Am I the only one who's sick to death of seeing this guy in yet another Burton film? I admit that Depp is a decent enough actor, in a generic sort of way, but the truth is, he is far too over-rated for my liking. And I think it's about time that Burton quit recycling him as if he were a dishrag.",4,3,5,4 January 2015
Super 8," Super 8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1-0-Blast Off!
","I don't much like films where it takes a phenomenally catastrophic event, like the one in Super 8, to get parents to finally realize the value of their kids. This sort of thing seems to be something of a recurring theme in a number of Steven Spielberg movies that I've seen.I also don't like films that show an overwhelming military presence in its story. Again, another somewhat common element in a Spielberg movie.In Super 8, with the military presence being that of the US military gathering in troops in its own country, I found it very odd how reluctant these members of the armed forces were at actually leveling with their own citizens about the reality of the present emergency situation. I think this is a very strange approach for the military to take, especially when you consider that a large portion of the taxes that Americans pay go to these guys' wages.Generally speaking, I found Super 8 to be one of those borderline alien invasion movies. In other words, its story left a lot to be desired. But, as always, with any Spielberg film, one really can't complain too much about the outstanding visuals.",5,2,4,10 May 2015
It's a Wonderful Life," Meet Clarence - An Angel With A Personal Agenda
","You know, at first I thought that this 1947 picture was a heart-felt story about good, old George Bailey and how he was driven (through certain escalating circumstance) to the absolute brink of desperation on Xmas eve.But, I now realize that this film's Christian-driven story-line was actually all about a calculating angel named Clarence who wanted to earn his wings. And so - With that agenda in mind - Clarence is sent down from heaven in order to assist George Bailey. And if he does so this will put him in favour with god and allow him to earn his wings.So, in other words - Clarence helping George has nothing to do with any apparent kindness, charity, or good will towards man - No. It doesn't - It's all just a selfish, self-serving act on Clarence's part to earn those wings that he covets so much.And so - With that in mind - I think that this covetous scenario reduces this manipulative, little tear-jerker to the slimy level of showing us all just how hypocritical and pretentious angels really are.",4,5,11,11 December 2016
Rosemary's Baby," Too Bad Rosemary Didn't Have Twins
","Believe me - The sinister scares that took place in this grossly over-rated Horror/Thriller from 1968 were so few, and far between, that they were almost non-existent.Basically, all that this movie ended up being is just one long, drawn-out build-up to a totally disappointing finale where, after sitting through well-over 2 hours of nonsense, we never even got a single glimpse of the demon-baby, anyways.When people speak about Rosemary's Baby, the word 'atmospheric' is how I've often heard many of them enthusiastically gush and rave over it. But about the only 'atmosphere' that I detected while watching this over-long movie was that of claustrophobia and boredom.Rosemary's Baby was yet another modern-day tale of Satanism. This time the inanity was set in New York City.I really wouldn't waste my time with this one. All the great stuff that people told me about it certainly wasn't the least bit true.",5,6,13,10 May 2015
Jaws," A 'Less-Than-Convincing' Eating Machine
","For me - The only times that the movie 'Jaws' ever came to life and became somewhat worthwhile to watch were only during the scenes that showcased the shark's attacks.And since these attacks happened so few and far between, that about rendered the remainder of this ultra-silly monster movie as being nothing more than one big, long yawn, for the most part.And another thing - Yes. Of course, I do fully realize that 'Jaws' was 'just-a-movie' - But, all the same, I'm hardly convinced that a shark (especially one of this predator's apparent cunning) would ever behave as this one inevitably did in its hot pursuit of Quint and his 2-man crew on-board the Orca.If you ask me - This great white rogue of the ocean was just too obviously dumb for words. Believe me, this blood-thirsty beast was just asking to be killed. (And, yep, in the end, its wish came true) In conclusion - From where I was sitting - 1975's 'Jaws' was yet another one of those ridiculous, big-budget movies that (now 40 years old) still manages to be grossly over-rated for reasons that I'd say are, for the most part, quite unfounded.",4,8,23,9 May 2015
Scream," And It All Began With A Scream Over 9-1-1!
","Using every slasher-movie clichÃ© in the book, Scream's deadly, blood-drenched story of vengeance and madness worked, for the most part, because it took the time to actually laugh at itself.Featuring a very strong opening sequence ('Hello? Who's calling?') that literally sent shivers of terror running up & down this viewer's spine (seriously), Scream certainly delivered the horrific goods in the course of its adrenaline-rush story.Competently directed by Wes Craven, I'd say that Scream and A Nightmare On Elm Street are 2 of this dude's best horror-movie offerings, to date. I can't believe that this movie actually spawned 3 inferior sequels.My 2 beefs about this film are - (1) The final sequence (which revealed who was behind these ghastly murders) was too dragged out and this seriously weakened the story's fever-pitch momentum.(2) Product placement of Chex cereal and Jiffy Pop popcorn lost this film some significant points.",6,2,4,21 January 2015
Blade Runner," Like A Replicant's Tears In The Rain
","Hey! Get this straight. If you don't like Blade Runner, you don't understand it. Why? Because you don't. You're not allowed to dislike it.Over the years Blade Runner has gathered around itself such a huge fan-base (that's so out of whack) that anyone who says they dislike it is instantly discredited and dismissed as an idiot. So, you better like Blade Runner, or you're an idiot, got it? Blade Runner is a completely brain-dead, wannabe, intellectual, Sci-Fi film that spends 2 hours delivering a careless and poorly managed love story and then 'Wham! Bam!' at the end it's suddenly a statement about the meaning of life. (Sorry, but the last 10 minutes don't make up for the first 2 hours.)And the question was raised - 'Was Deckard really a replicant?' Who cares! Harrison Ford's portrayal was about as realistic as that of a robot. And about half the time he walked around looking like he'd just been punched in the nuts.Is Blade Runner a finely sculpted masterpiece of cinematic excellence? No, it is not!! If this film is really Ridley Scott's idea of poignant commentary, then it sure makes me glad to know that he doesn't have an ego.",1,69,136,3 January 2015
Identity," Eeny-Meeny-Miny-Moe - One Personality Left To Go!
","Identity has got to be one of screwiest flicks that I have seen to date. Identity deliberately misleads the audience (which I don't mind). Identity purposely confuses and tricks one into thinking they're actually watching 2 separate movies at the same time, but, in reality they're not.It seems that these 2 flicks have been inexplicably spliced together. But the truth is it's just one tangled and intertwined story that, literally, takes reaching the end of the film before the logical side of things get ironed out. (Well, sort of) Identity's story is so convoluted and incoherent, at times, that if we were all schizos ourselves to begin with, then we might be able to appreciate this flick to its fullest.Identity's story revolves around 10 'so-called' strangers who, during a dark and violently stormy night, all end up congregating at some rundown, rinky-dink motel set out in No-Mans-Land in the middle of the Arizona Desert.Just like the movie Ten Little Indians the characters all start to get bumped off, one by one. Who's behind these brutal murders, and why this is happening, is a movie plot-twist that, I suppose, is intended to end all movie plot-twists. You judge for yourself and then tell me that Hollywood doesn't overplay mental-disorder, and such, to the point of being downright ridiculous far too often.The cast of Identity is headed by the talents of, none other than, Mr. Leave-It-To-Beaver, John Cusack, and Mr. Damage-Face, Ray Liotta.",5,2,6,23 May 2015
Cinderella," So, This Is Love (?)....
","'Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo!' Yeah. Yeah. I know full-well that the story of Cinderella was, pretty much, just an empty-headed, little fairy tale about wishful thinking, and such - But, all the same, I found that there was definitely some really peculiar problems with this tale (as a whole) that prevented me, as an adult, from giving it more than an average rating of 5 stars.I mean, not only was Prince Charming just another pretty face with no personality to speak of at all, and his father, the king, a blustering idiot of the highest order - But I also seriously thought that the Cinderella character was clearly missing some of her marbles and even teetering on the edge of insanity by having real conversations with a bunch of mice and actually fashioning clothes for them.Another thing that caused me to doubt Cinderella as being a rational-thinking person was the fact that she allowed herself to be locked up in a tower and treated like pure garbage by her wicked stepmother and stepsisters. Like, wasn't there such things as 'Human Rights' back in those days? Surely Cinderella could've found a reasonable out from having to endure the torment from these decidedly wretched people.I also found it rather odd that this animated film's most entertaining moments had little at all to do with Cinderella and more to do with the slapstick shenanigans that went on between the non-human characters, like Lucifer, the cat, and the colony of smartly dressed mice.",5,5,11,18 June 2015
Rear Window," Are You Ready For Some Home-Spun Philosophy?
","I don't know about where you live - But in the 14-storey building that faces the building where I live in Vancouver, BC - I'd say that less than 20% of its tenants actually keep their curtains wide-opened all the time.And, of course, this was not at all like it was in 'Rear Window' where, literally, everyone was, pretty much, parading around in front of their windows (except for the bashful newlyweds) without any care, or concern, in the world that the guy across the courtyard was not only using binoculars (but a telescope, as well) to observe their private activities Anyway - With that said - I thought that this 1954, Alfred Hitchcock thriller was fairly entertaining. Its story did build quite nicely to its adrenaline-charged climatic finale.",6,5,8,8 January 2017
The Matrix," Reeves Seriously Miscast As 'Neo'
","You know, each time I view The Matrix, once again, I find that I'm liking the thing less and less. It's true. In fact, it's actually gotten to the point here where I literally find myself about a hair's breadth away from totally hating this flick, big time. Yep. I figure that with just a few more viewings and I should, most definitely, be there, sure enough.It's so true that The Matrix' story is so riddled full of holes, and rife with inconsistencies, that it makes a piece of Swiss Cheese look like a solid brick of Cheddar.It doesn't help matters much (when I'm trying to enjoy this film) that I detest Keanu Reeves as much as I do. I really think that he makes a damn-lousy Neo. I mean - Let's face it - Reeves just isn't a very convincing bright-boy. And he makes a truly terrible lover for Trinity, too.What more can I say?",4,3,7,10 May 2015
Her," Him Meets 'Her'
","Can you just imagine what sort of a world this would be if more and more people suddenly began to fall in love with their computer's operating system? I mean, talk about a revealing statement when it comes to the likes of loneliness and the apparent aversion to physical intimacy.If this sort of computer-age love affair (as depicted in 'Her') became the latest trend, can you imagine how drastically that would affect human pregnancies (unwanted, or not), as well as the transmission of STDs? And, of course, on a really positive note - The expectation of buying one's sweetheart presents (when you're romancing your computer's operating system) would be just about nil.Anyway - I thought Her's story was very poorly conceived and really unsatisfactory as far as entertainment goes. And, not only that, but, in all of its shallowness and pretentiousness, I inevitably felt nothing but total contempt for the slimy Theodore Twombly character.",2,3,6,19 August 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Yawn-City To The 'Max'!
","And, $150 million later....Mad Max is yet another one of those painfully predictable 'set-in-the-future' action films where (even though it's been given a 'Restricted' rating) its brain-dead story completely caters to a juvenile mentality.Within less than 30 minutes - Mad Max's over-the-top action sequences (of one vehicle crash after another) got so annoyingly repetitive that, in no time flat, it all became too tiresome for words.This is definitely one of those pictures where you could easily watch a good part of it in 'fast-forward' mode and you know that you're not gonna miss a damn thing of any importance.And, yes - As I figured - This picture's story ended on a note that (unfortunately) had 'sequel-to-follow' written all over it.... Yawn-city to the max!",4,5,7,13 December 2016
Warm Bodies," A Zombie Movie With A Sesame Street Mentality
","Warm Bodies was, without question, one of those infuriating 'zombie-turned-love-story' movies that only excelled in earning my complete contempt for it and all of its utter preposterousness.If you ask me - Warm Bodies was so brain-dead and moronic (on all counts) that it only ended up completely disgracing the movie sub-genre of zombies like no other picture I've ever seen before, or since.And, as far as zombie movies go - Warm Bodies contained so many glaring flaws and equally cringe-worthy moments that, at this point, I don't know where the heck to start voicing and venting my total disgust for this reeking heap of idiotic asininity.So, in conclusion - I will bring my angry commentary to its abrupt end by simply saying that I sure hope that this sort of 'zombie-turned-love-story' movie isn't going to become the latest trend.Sheesh! Spare me that ultimate torture!",2,1,2,11 February 2016
The Birds," Birds Of A Feather?
","OK. Here's the sound of the birds in The Birds... Caw! Caw! Caw!... Tweet! Tweet! Tweet!... Cackle! Cackle! Cackle!... Chirp! Chirp! Chirp! (Ad nauseum) Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, The Birds was the film that followed next after Psycho. And, when it came to the element of horror, I think this film was clearly a giant step down the ladder.This film's preposterous story about common birds, like crows, seagulls and finches, flocking together and deliberately attacking the residents in the town of Bodega Bay (with the intent to kill them) made no sense at all.And the focus on the hot/cold relationship that got underway between Mitch and Melanie only served to turn the whole story into a sappy, 2nd-rate soap opera.",5,5,10,23 May 2015

","Psssst!.... You wanna know a secret??..... Now, this is strictly 'hush-hush' stuff - So, don't tell anyone - OK!? 'Cause what I'm gonna tell you here is vitally important. It sure is. And, it goes like this....After watching 'The Martian' - I seriously think that director Ridley Scott (who is now 80 years old) should retire (like - ASAP!!) from film-making - Permanently!.... He really should.... Yeah. His Sci-Fi movie-making days are clearly over-the-rainbow, as far as I'm concerned. (Like - Hasn't he made enough money, already?) Now, remember - This is our little secret.... So - (shhhh!) Please, don't tell anyone.... OK? Thanks so much!",3,2,4,8 September 2016
