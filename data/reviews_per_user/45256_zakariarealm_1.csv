The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Great.
","This will easily be one of the greatest and the most well made movies of this decade. The cast is very good and the acting is wonderful, especially the main characters, which we can hardly imagine another actors instead of them. The story is great and the scenario too. Without any heavy parts, without lame drama scenes and gentle progression. I got surprised several time, by things I was predicting happening in a different way of the one I had in mind or by not happening at all. The main emotion I got during and at the end of the film is a unusual mixture of joy and sadness, which is kindly sweet and not bitter. We can easily understand and feel a little of what the characters feel, without necessarily having anything in common with them and not sharing their personality aspects.",7,2,4,20 May 2013
