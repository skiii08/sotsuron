Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," YOU MUST READ THIS REVIEW
","The following words are my personal thoughts on Star Wars Episode One The Phantom Menace. It is in no way out to insult or offend anyone or anything. If you haven't seen the film then I would advise you not to read the following as it may give away plot lines, etc.I enjoyed the film but didn't think it was deep enough. It relied too much on presuming you'd seen Star Wars (A New Hope). There wasn't enough mystic content (i.e. stuff on the force). Liam Neeson was good, as ever but you never really got any massive Force vibe from him. So, he can make a dice land on a certain side. That does not quite cut it for me. It didn't go into detail about the force as much as I would've hoped. At that time there were Jedis all over the place, the 'Force' should've been a massive factor in the film. On that subject,  felt confused as this film is supposed to be set only 30years before episode 4. So how, in 30 years, does 'The Force' go from something that everyone knows about and seems to take for granted, to some ancient mystical thing that allot of people are sceptical even exists? Maybe we find out in episodes 2 and 3.Qui-Gon Jinn & Obi-Wan Kenobi were not as Jedi-like as they could or rather should have been. There were more just adventures/savours.However, Liam Neeson's character was the best thing in the film and was closest to the Star Wars I know & love.Darth Maul, was in no way evil enough. His script was poor if at all there. He was in fact the Phantom Menace was he not? So why did George Lucas not go deeper into Maul's character? He could've been a fantastic character, a real evil, mystical, powerful presence......but alas no.Anakin Skywalker actually had some depth to his character, he had a story you could follow and was not as annoying as I'd expected. Two poor points however, when he says goodbye to his Mum there seems to be no  real emotion unlike when Luke discovers his Aunt & Uncle dead. He's only a little boy so he would want to go off and play in the stars and become a Jedi, who wouldn't?..However he just couldn't walk away from his Mother in that manner and she took it pretty well too...I realise it is a difficult scene to write/do but something didn't work for me. It just seemed rushed and read through in a 'okay lets get on to the next scene now' way. In fact, for me, much like most of the film and the feel of the film itself. The other poor point about Anakin's character. The scene when he's in the Space-Ship, within the Space Station near the end of the film. Skywalker's character suddenly becomes like something out of a bad American Science Fiction movie. He should've been at least scared, (especially as we'd touched on the fear factor earlier in the film) and trying to control his emotions; like a true young potential Jedi (as he's supposed to be!) Not messing about pressing buttons in a 'I'm really not bothered at all that I could easily die here and at the same time am being cute & amusing' way. It didn't work with the Ewoks and it didn't work with the young Darth Vader.However the Pod race definitely worked for me. Exciting and powerful. Enjoyable stuff! Apart of course from the other giant American influence, that two headed American commentator. Very annoying,  this was supposed to be a galaxy far, far away not (as in my case) across the water. For me, George Lucas was always heading that way, all you have to do is compare A New Hope to Return of the Jedi.One more Anakin point, actually it's not really an Anakin point, it just happened to be one of his lines. What I've grown up loving and one of the factors that always made Star Wars unique was the trusty 'Light Sabre' not a LASER SWORD!!!! as it was referred to in The Phantom Menace. Not once was 'Light Sabre' mentioned or even 'Force Beam'. I call a pen a pen cause that's what it is and always was, its a word that always worked fine, not an ink stick! If its not broke, then don't fix it! My final point. Years ago George Lucas created, if you like almost a new religion called the Force. This has become so famous that it almost exists. You go up to anyone and say, 'The force' and they will know exactly what you're talking about. That on its own, is impressive and amazing enough, let alone the world of Star Wars with it. Â‘The Force' is explained it well in the 3 original films, I personally particularly watch with great interest as Yoda trains Luke in Empire. So this said, I have to comment on how disappointed that Episode 1 changes something that has always worked better than just well by adding a new side to it. What I'm referring to is the symbiotic life form thing - just completely unnecessary - if Qui Gon' senses that the boy is special that's good enough for me. The force is a mysterious energy field that surrounds us, penetrates us, and binds the Galaxy together. Its not something you can measure with a machine. That was my most disappointing moment in the entire film. We were taught that the force is more than just moving objects around and is definitely not lifeforms within cells. Once again, if its not broke, then don't fix it! I have not mentioned yet what is to most people the worst character in the film. If  Jar Jar Binks was the only thing wrong with the Film then I'd be a happy man. There has always been characters like that in the Star Wars films. C3PO & R2D2 for example. So basically I can put up with Jar Jar, yes his voice was annoying and yes, he was an unnecessary character....I did like it when Obe wan said something along the lines of 'have we picked up another pointless being' Nice one. The pointless character isn't the point, its the entire film, the fact that the Force was not concentrated on disappointed me and most importantly the changes to the aspects not needing a change. Having said all I have it may seem I don't like this Film. Well I don't think that is entirely true. Overall I enjoyed it - the trade dispute story was just in the background but involving enough, Binks was just there for the Kids and the action was at least all I expected.
