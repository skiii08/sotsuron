Antz," Good in it's own right..
","Okay, as almost everyone already knows, Antz is part of the film battle list including films of similar style and story released during the same year. IE Antz/A Bugs Life. I think both films are very good, but most would probably say A Bugs Life takes the cake. Yeah, that's only because Disney, one of the biggest film companies in the world was backing it, along with every other Pixar movie for that matter. I thought A Bugs Life was good, but was too much like a kids movie for me. I think personally Antz appealed to a wider audience. Maybe not for little kids, but a wider audience none the less. I guess it's the mild level of vulgarity in Dreamworks animated movies that I like. They are a little more lenient with swearing and such, and 'cruder' humor. Where as Disney has a threshold on making sure all dialogue is pretty much censored. So, in my opinion Antz is the winner. Just as funny as A Bugs Life, and actually it was a little more 'real'. Umm...no blue ants.",8,0,0,15 December 2009
Captain Phillips," Makes a Better Yahoo News Story Than a Movie
","I first saw this movie a few weeks ago out of pure interest. The high ratings and rave reviews intrigued me enough to give it a look see. I knew nothing about this film apart from it being based on 'actual events'. Now, like any film based on real life events, there's always two sides of the story being told. What those who experienced it say, and what we see on the big screen. Nevertheless, I went into this film with an open mind. Tom Hanks once again proves his range as an actor, although for this film it wasn't as extended as in other roles he's portrayed. The reason I'm giving this movie a 6 out of 10 has nothing to do with any of the performances in this film. Everyone was excellent, including Barkad Abdi, who does incredibly well for his first time on screen ever. The reason for the low score, the story is bland. I understand that not every film needs to have guns blazing, cars exploding, or CGI in every scene to be a good film, this movie is just bland. There are a remote few times where your heart gets racing about how a scene will play out, then you get dragged on for extended periods of time where nothing happens. I mean no disrespect to anyone in this film, nor those who went through this ordeal, but this is just not the type of story you turn into a major motion picture. This is something you read about in 5 paragraphs on a headline article on Yahoo News.",5,7,14,19 January 2014
Burn After Reading," Remember, it's a Coen Brothers Movie
","First off, before you go an watch this movie and jump straight to giving this movie a 4/10. Stop and remember, it's a Coen Brothers Movie. So in that being said you have to look at the comedy from the perspective of watching another Coen movie. I knew when I read that the Coen brothers made this movie and picked up on it being a comedy I knew it was gonna be good. Another thing, its nice to see Clooney and Pitt playing characters that are far from their typical styled roles in movies. I mean come on, Brad Pitt as an athletic instructor at a health and fitness gym, and George Clooney as an everyday man pretty much. So overall I give this movie about an 8.5 or 9 outta 10. A high rating I know, but this is grade A Coen Brothers at their comedic best. Give it a chance and watch it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",9,2,8,10 November 2009
District 9," Wilkus is Brundle Fly...
","I thought I might start off with a bit of a joke. For those of you that have seen District 9 already and The Fly with Jeff Goldblum, you got my joke. Or at least I hope you did. Anyway, I was very surprised by District 9. It took a very interesting approach and not one I expected at all. It's nice to see a change of pace with these alien Sci Fi movies. The story is a little unusual and is a little difficult to understand and follow with the semi-documentary style of filming they do. But none the less, a great film. A pretty graphic movie at times so hope you have a strong stomach. But if you can get past that, you're in for a treat with this movie. Not bad for a 'first' time actor and director if you ask me.",8,0,4,16 October 2009
Mad Max: Fury Road," George Miller's Intended Vision Finally Realized
","Some 36 years ago completely unknown director George Miller released what went on to be one the biggest cult action films in history, Mad Max. Starring the also unknown at the time, Mel Gibson. Who much like Harrison Ford in Star Wars released only 2 years earlier, was the lone star of the film to make it big in Hollywood. Mel would go onto become on the biggest names in Hollywood throughout the 80's and 90's while director George Miller fell into obscurity, maintaining a presence as a working Director, but releasing radically different films like the animated hit children's film Happy Feet. I didn't have the highest hopes for Mad Max: Fury Road when I first got wind of it some 4+ years ago. I grew up as big fan of the original Mad Max trilogy as my dad is a huge fan of Mel Gibson. I knew that Fury Road was going through production hell and always was scrapped entirely with how long the process was taking, some 10+ years with changing stories, actors, etc. When I finally heard that they were in pre-production and had a set cast in Charlize Theron, and Nicholas Hoult, I anxiously waited word on who the new Mad Max was going to be. My original bet and hope was for Terminator Salvation / Avatar actor Sam Worthington, when they announced Tom Hardy, I thought to myself...okay, okay. After seeing the first full length trailer, I was jaw dropped. I knew that George finally achieved in making the film he envisioned making some 36 years ago. Mad Max, the way he saw it in his head. Everyone delivers an amazing performance. Including the unknown Hugh Keays-Byrne, who is only well known for his role as Toecutter in the original Mad Max film.I think what baffles me the most is how in the world this movie gets made. Honestly? How does a director at the age of 70! Who is only known primarily for a film series with a mere cult following at best, get granted a $150 million dollar budget!? Unlike Star Wars which established a massive following in it's time before releasing it's newest trilogy. George Lucas also maintained a heavy industry presence in writing films (Indiana Jones) before the new Star Wars trilogy was announced. That was also a mere 16 year difference between the release of Return of the Jedi and The Phantom Menace. I think what helped this film was the nature of the story, it's even more relative today than 30+ years ago, it follows a central 'post apocalyptic' theme that is also very popular now. It appeals to adults young and old, admirers of the original 'Mad Max' story, and those looking for a good action film. I'm so excited that this movie was able to get made. I'm still mind boggled by it, but still very happy that this movie got made. I saw it a month ago and I'm still geeking out about it. To put it simply, this is to the original Mad Max Trilogy, to that of what George Lucas hoped for with the Star Wars prequels.",10,1,10,29 June 2015
