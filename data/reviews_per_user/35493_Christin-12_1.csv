The Blair Witch Project," Scared me to death
","I had never heard of this movie, never saw a preview for it or heard any type of hype. When my husband mentioned it to me, I thought it sounded kind of creepy, but I was interested because it was supposed to be live footage and based on a true story. All I can say is that I went into that movie thinking I was watching something that had really happened to those people, and I have never been more terrified in my life then when I was sitting in my movie theatre seat. I could not sleep that night and all I could do was replay the movie in my head. I went to work the next day and could not stop talking about it.  Not that I would ever wish death on anybody, but that is how real it was to me. I am so happy that I did not read any of the articles, reviews or hype because it truly would not have been as intense for me.Excellent, excellent movie.",Null,1,2,19 July 1999
