Frost_Nixon," Clever entertainment, with one of those wonderful, political non-apologetic apologies for a climax
","Entertainment, it is; history, it's not. David Frost, if he doesn't hate Michael Sheen's amusing parody of himself, should. Sheen's Frost is a young man in love with the excitement and high life of being a television celebrity, as eager and quick as a chipmunk and as shallow as a plate. The portrayal of Richard Nixon, however, is misleading. For the purposes of a cathartic audience conclusion, Ron Howard (the director), Peter Morgan (the playwright) and Frank Langella, (the actor, in an amazing performance) lead us up to an emotional climax which is played for something that looks like Shakespearean tragedy...a great man, torn by internal conflicts, finally brought down (on television yet) by the recognition of his own deep flaws. Well, come on. This certainly makes a surprisingly effective movie, but Richard Nixon is a more suitable study for students of morbid psychology and for those who appreciate the hypocrisy of self-serving politicians. Nixon was no Greek protagonist, just a hard-working, deeply insecure, ferociously ambitious man who was willing to do whatever was needed to defeat those he thought of as his enemies and to prove to the world he was a worthy man. This is the mediocrity of loveless ambition matched with lots of Scotch, not the tragedy of self-inflicted wounds in a noble cause. Howard and Morgan allow one of those political non-apologies to pass as revelation. 'I let down the American people,' not 'I created the climate that led to the crime of a burglary, and then I initiated and took part in the cover-up...and I was wrong.' As much to the point as anything, Howard and Morgan give us such an old-fox portrayal of slyness and one-upmanship, which confounds Frost's young puppy, that most of us probably wind up routing for Nixon. All this works dramatically, of course, when the puppy finally grows some teeth...but then we're merely left with that masterful non-apology and a moment of supremely effective acting by Frank Langella. The only part of Frost/Nixon that brings into focus the real-life ruthless danger of a man like Nixon in the presidency is the moment when Frost teases out of Nixon the ex-president's belief that whatever a president does is always legal because it is the president who does it. We know (and should be scared to death) that there are political lawyers and ambitious political hacks who agree. That moment, for anyone who values the Constitution and those strangely effective concepts of the separation of power and the rule of law, was, in my view, passed over too lightly. Frost/Nixon is a fascinating and enjoyable bit of movie entertainment based on a fascinating and enjoyable stage play. It's expecting too much to think it would be more than that. For those who might be interested in another portrayal of Nixon, this time alone in his study, deep in Scotch and self-pity, talking into a recorder while he justifies his life, watch Robert Altman's, Donald Freed's and Arnold Stone's Secret Honor. Philip Baker Hall as Nixon is mesmerizing.",8,1,3,4 January 2009
3:10 to Yuma," 1957: Great story and fine craftsmanship. 2007: Thirty minutes of angst are added and the story suffers
","My take on 2007's 3:10 to Yuma? Ninety-two minutes for the 1957 original versus 122 minutes. Thirty-two listed actors of which 11 are credited (according to IMDb) versus 43 listed actors of which 32 are credited. Taut craftsmanship with few obvious lessons versus morality Hollywood-style. No angst, just a great Western story versus so much angst (morality, redemption, failure, father/son, husband/wife, and so on) that I thought I'd never get the angst out of my clothes. A tension-filled duel of wits and stubbornness between Van Heflin and Glenn Ford which ties them closer and closer together versus odd and unnecessary (except by Hollywood standards) hints of an attachment that dare not speak its name featuring Wade's psycho sidekick, Great character acting versus great character acting. Two fine lead performances versus two fine lead performances...but for Dan Evans I'll take Heflin's straightforward doggedness over Christian Bale's modern-day intensity. While I like Ford's and Russell Crowe's performances as Ben Wade, just as a matter of personal preference I like Ford's particular style of slyness and charisma as Wade a little better than Crowe's. An ending that is tidy and quite satisfying versus an ending that tries to carry too much meaning. Is it fair to judge a contemporary remake against the original? I think it probably is when the remake suffers (in my view) from contemporary Hollywood bloat. The original was a tight, small story put together by Hollywood craftsmen who knew how to tell and present a story on film. There just isn't, in my opinion, 30 minutes of better movie in the remake. I've watched the Ford/Heflin version a couple of times. I doubt that I'll revisit the Crowe/Bale version. For those who like movies, whichever version you wind up liking, watching both might be a worthwhile way to spend three-and-a-half hours.",8,0,1,10 August 2009
Milk," One extraordinary performance in one fine movie, which has the usual Hollywood self-congratulatory blemishes
","Milk is Sean Penn's best-sustained performance since Fast Times at Ridgemont High. I'm not joking and I mean it as high praise. Penn, at least in those movies of his I've seen, starts strongly and then dives into that famous Penn intensity that some consider acting with a capital 'A.' In Milk, Penn early establishes Milk as smart, empathetic, self-aware, even gentle, playful and lovable. Penn doesn't lose those qualities, and adds to them sadness, commitment and shrewdness. Penn doesn't give in to what must have been a great temptation to turn Milk and Milk's issues into a Hollywood-style, self-congratulatory showboat performance. Unfortunately, Gus Van Sant does that. The first half or so of Milk is an outstanding movie that combines acting, issues and characterization in a just about seamless manner. We get to know and like Harvey Milk. We understand where he's coming from. His authenticity as a gay man isn't played for kiss-on- the-lips shock value, just for who Milk is. His growth as a gay rights activist -- and a shrewd one -- is not presented with rants and melodrama. His defeats and then success in San Francisco politics is given to us understandably and with wit. But then we get to Proposition 6. For me, Gus Van Sant caricatures the struggle, throwing up the proponents as oily monsters, setting up Milk as the sole voice of humor and reason, who scores points while all those coiffured PTA moms register disapproval. (This isn't to minimize the importance of the issues, how loathsome many of the advocates for Proposition 6 were or the role of Milk in winning a great victory for basic human rights.) The last third of Milk, for me, changes from an intensely sympathetic story of an interesting man and the issues he fought for to the kind of brave screed for human rights and justice that the Hollywood establishment latches on to only when the danger has past and it's safe for them to take a stand. Not only does Van Sant seem to forget Milk as a human being, but we also find ourselves in the Hollywood version of processing Milk for sainthood. It seems to me that homosexuality in Hollywood films has for a long time been played either for easy laughs or for tawdry or vicious melodrama. Then Hollywood entered it's brave phase of gay love, with young men metaphorically running across the fields to each other in slow motion (sometimes on horse back), or whispering dreamily to each other of their hopes and plans while wondering why people can't just let them alone. Milk gets it right in my view. Harvey Milk flirts, gets horny, kisses right on the smacker, laughs, loves to jump in bed with someone he either loves or who just turns him on, has love problems, believes in issues that are important to him, makes good choices and bad choices. Well, gay or straight, male or female, don't most of us? Sean Penn makes Milk not just believable but matter of fact. It's a terrific performance.",8,2,6,28 December 2008
Pan's Labyrinth," An extraordinary, major film...marred a little by three lapses into the genre of teen horror yuckiness
","Pan's Labyrinth is a marvelous, serious movie full of allegory, the easiest being fascism and freedom, nightmares and dreams. This is a film that people who like movies about ideas and implications will chew over and come back to. And I hope Sergi Lopez is doing things other than bad guys. He's a first-class actor. Those who've seen Dirty Pretty Things will recall him. As Harry in the French psycho movie, With a Friend Like Harry, he's exactly not the kind of friend to have. I have one caveat. I wish first-class directors (and second-class directors, too) could resist indulging in the brutality 'wow' factor some of their fans seem to love so much. I could see no purpose except to have the audience go 'yuck' when the Captain's cheek is slit, when he sews it up himself and when he uses a bottle to smash in a captive's face. All are shown in close-up and in loving detail. Pan's Labyrinth is so good a movie that the three yuck moments aren't needed, in my view, except for pandering to a segment of the audience. But doesn't the face-smashing truly and quickly establish the really brutal and vicious nature of the man, particularly as an allegory for fascism? Perhaps, but did it need to be shown in close-up? The whole scene was threatening because of the way Lopez played it. His brutal character, for me, was quickly set through Lopez' performance and the fright of the two peasants...there was no doubt, from my point of view, about the Captain's character. That was established to my satisfaction by the Captain matter-of-factly personally shooting the father more than once, then turning to put bullets into the son...more bullets than were needed, and by doing it himself. Then following that by the discovery of the rabbits in the knapsack and the...what? just irritation toward his subordinate for not thoroughly searching the two peasants. I'll offer this as something to think about: If the three incidents I mentioned 1) had not been shot in close-up, but had been shown in medium shots or 2) with the bottle scene, the Captain starts to smash the bottle into the face but there was a cut-away so the direct smashing impacts weren't seen, and 3) if the cheek slitting had been shown in a different angle and the sewing had been seen from a different, non-close-up angle...would the impact of the story or the film be significantly changed in any important emotional or visual way? For me, the answer is 'no.' The cheek sewing, for me, established that the Captain really was an evil not of this world, worse than anything Ofelia had encountered in her world...but the director, from a practical, visual, emotional level, did not have to use close-ups of the needle going in and out of the flesh to establish that point. When I saw the movie the theater was packed. Believe me, when those three scenes came up all I could hear was 'Yuck' from the audience with undertones of either delight or revulsion. It seemed to me people were caught up in the bloody close-up moment, just as they would be in some gory teen horror flick, and not in any expanded meaning about the characters or the story. The movie, itself, despite this directorial indulgence, remains a fascinating and thoughtful film that will most likely be remembered and watched years from now.",8,0,4,6 February 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Grand guignol at its best...meaning razors, slit throats, dripping red stuff and enough black humor to fill a cemetery
","'They all deserve to die. Tell you why, Mrs. Lovett, tell you why. Because in all of the whole human race, Mrs. Lovett, there are two kinds of men and only two. There's the one staying put in his proper place and one with his foot in the other one's face. Look at me, Mrs Lovett! Look at you! No, we all deserve to die. Even you, Mrs Lovett, even I!' If you had any doubt, that's Sweeney Todd, and he puts his philosophy to work. Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street, is Stephen Sondheim's re-telling of a barber driven mad. His wife and child were taken from him by a corrupt judge, who used and destroyed the wife and kept the child, who now is a young woman. Sweeney was transported, but he managed years later to return to London. While he plans his revenge on the judge he takes his revenge on humanity. He slits the throats of those he shaves. He's fortunate in meeting Mrs. Lovett, who makes a poor living making and selling awful meat pies, the main ingredient of which is pussycat. Now with Sweeney providing a constant source of fresh meat, her pies become best sellers. Sweeney finds his daughter, but retribution is inevitable. Now, twenty- eight years after Sweeney's Broadway debut, Tim Burton, with Sondheim's encouragement, has made a movie of the show. A tragedy of revenge, as some critics have said? I'm not so sure about that...there's too much lip-smacking by Burton and Sondheim, as well as by the audience (at least the audience I was a part of) over the gore. But Sweeney Todd certainly is tops as a superb example of an engrossing, cynically humorous, fast-paced, wonderfully acted piece of flinch-inducing Grand Guignol. I enjoyed every minute of it, even while I was squinting my eyes to avoid most of the neck slitting. Even as graphic as the slicing and blood spurting was, there was something so over the top about those scenes that perhaps I'm just a softy. (But note how Sondheim mixes together the beautiful song of longing, 'Johanna,' with the impersonal series of throats being slit. It's startling to hear and see, and the beauty of the song nearly makes us complicit in Sweeney's on-camera blood-letting. On the stage it was even more riveting. It's a brilliant, lengthy set piece.) All the actors, I thought, did a fine job doing their own singing. Sondheim said recently in the NYTimes that he agreed completely with the decision to cast the actors first for their acting abilities and then for their singing skills, not the other way. Bonham Carter has taken some criticism, but I think she does a perfectly fine job. She has a light voice without much power behind it...but she certainly did an excellent job with her meat pies song and her by the sea song. Her characterization of the character was excellent, I thought. Fortunately, playing Mrs. Lovett isn't a zero sum gain; I think it's perfectly reasonable to enjoy what Bonham Carter does with the role while loving the ghastly comic turn Angela Lansbury gave Mrs. Lovett on stage. It would hard to think of better actors for doing such revolting jobs as degenerates than Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin and Timothy Spall as the beadle. For me, where the movie starts to slacken a bit is toward the end, when Sondheim tries to bring a sense of real tragedy to the story. That has been a problem, as far as I'm concerned, with the stage production as well as the movie. Too obvious, too 'sincere' for me. Still, without the final revelations there wouldn't be a story at all. I saw the stage show shortly after it opened on Broadway, then again when a touring company brought it to St. Louis. My reaction then was the same as with nearly all Sondheim shows I've seen...too mannered, too overly intellectual, too clever. Then I listen to the recordings of the songs from his shows and I change my mind. Burton's movie (over which Sondheim had control over how the songs would be presented and over any cuts) seems to me to have resulted in a much more affective presentation, due to the style, the cuts and the trims, than the stage show. And it seems to me that Johnny Depp has established himself as the most interesting and versatile American actor of his generation, probably the most talented, too. I cannot conceive of Di Caprio, Cruise, Pitt, etc., etc., being able to carry this part, much less even taking the chance and agreeing to play it.",8,1,3,27 January 2008
Gone Baby Gone," Amy Ryan shines and there are some fine piece parts...but there also are a lot of 'acting' moments and sermonizing
","Gone Baby Gone drops more F-bombs than dogs in a public park drop pooch poop. That's only part of the problem with this movie that contains within a lot of wrapping a clever, complicated mystery. Scattered throughout the movie also are what seem to be endless 'acting' moments for every featured actor, a style of self-aware directing that spills over onto some of the actors' performances, and enough social sermonizing to keep even Sean Penn happy. Some of my impatience with this movie is because the mystery depends on so much well- planned sleight of hand that it raised my expectations for a solid, complicated mystery drama. The structure and presentation of the drama is well managed by director Ben Affleck. So is any number of individual scenes (when the acting doesn't start getting impassioned). And Amy Ryan as the cokehead mother simply walks away with the acting honors. She does it by making us believe she's what she's acting as, something a number of the other actors, in my opinion, don't quite pull off. Casey Affleck is just fine as the young private investigator who at first believes what he sees and then begins to figure things out. Ed Harris, on the other hand, and made up to look for some reason like Patrick McGoohan on Columbo, chews the scenery as if he were breaking in a new set of false teeth. Morgan Freeman plays yet another variation on his wise, humanistic, aging gentleman. Freeman needs to find a role where he can kick a reporter to death or humiliate a young pair of lovers. Somewhere along the way he has misplaced his real ability to be vicious. Just watch him as Fast Black in Street Smart. As the story develops there are more and more twists. At first, and putting aside the feeling of the movie being too sincere for its own good, this led to a lot of tricky fun. By the time we reached the conclusion and all became clear, all also became stretched out with a series of mini-dramas that seemed to have difficulty finding a way to stop. Even Gone Baby Gone's basic argument -- isn't saving a child from almost certain degradation worth bending the rules, even if really bad scumbags pay a price -- is compromised by the naivety implicit in the question. Do we really want to live in a world where the police get to play God and make those decisions? Or maybe we should let the police play God only when it comes to little kids. Or only when it comes to little kids but no more often than once a month. Is there an answer to this apparently weighty question? The movie implies that there isn't. Come on. Sure there is. There's quite a bit to enjoy in Gone Baby Gone, just not enough, in my opinion, to make a fully professional, satisfying story. But I'll give it this: The movie isn't mediocre and it isn't dull.",7,0,1,10 June 2008
Burn After Reading," A throw-away effort by the Coen Brothers, but Tilda Swinton takes the prize for seriously unlikable funniness
","If you enjoy sour shaggy dog stories told for the enjoyment of clever, sour people, you might like Burn After Reading...a shaggy dog story if there ever was one. It takes the easy target of Washington's shallow denizens and mixes them into the equally easy targets of CIA paranoia and serial infidelities. And all these denizens, with one possible exception, are either numbskull boobs or nasty boobs. The Coens have given us not only a sour shaggy dog story, designed to pull the rug from under the audience, but they've populated their tale with characters that are interchangeable cardboard cutouts. The characters may look different and sound different, and may even appeal a little because of the cleverness of their unlikability, but they all dance to the same tune...the Coen Brothers patented polka that can be mighty engaging at times, but can also become as condescending as a Saturday Night Live skit. If a director and a writer have any respect for their audience, they don't behave as if the audience is just part of the joke...the dumb patsy everyone else will snigger at for being taken in by that shaggy dog. If Marge Gunderson had turned out to be the shallow, constant butt-of-a-joke that Linda Litzke is, Fargo would never have been a great movie, just a show- off film filled with nothing but black humor and technique. With Burn After Reading there's no one likable except a guy who gets his with an axe. Even the Coen Brothers' technique seems to fail them. Burn After Reading, for me, just lurches from one set piece to the next. Half way through we realize nothing is going to get better, nothing is going to change, and the deaths, body disposal issues, black humor and CIA insouciance are going to be tiresome and predictable. Brad Pitt has gotten a lot of press for his performance, and why not? But I'll give my award to Tilda Swinton. For my money she was the only person who managed to be both true to her character (e.g., a boob or unlikable, and in Swinton's case, unlikable) and yet very amusing in her unlikability. She's first rate. Wish the movie had been. To see Swinton at her most sympathetic, watch her in Young Adam and The Deep End.",6,8,18,6 October 2008
The Orphanage," 'When something terrible happens sometimes it leaves a trace. It's like an echo repeated over and over, waiting to be heard...'
","The old, old stone mansion that once was an orphanage sits isolated within its ill-kempt gardens and grounds. The abandoned lighthouse on the cliff not far away no longer shines a beacon. The cave below and the sandy beach still receive the incoming tide. Be wary. Laura Sanchez grew up in the orphanage. When she was about seven she was adopted and left. Now she is 37, married to Carlos, and they are parents to a little boy, Simon, about seven. They adopted Simon, who doesn't know this, and who is deadly ill with a disease only pills can keep at bay. Now Laura and Carlos have just bought the abandoned orphanage and are moving in. It is a large building of many rooms and hallways, with dark oak paneling, old fire places and frosted, etched glass. They hope to make it a home for children with special needs. There are no children yet, just Simon. Simon makes friends, make-believe friends. They tell him things, he says. 'I won't grow old. I'm not going to grow up,' he tells his mother. 'Will you be like Peter Pan?' Laura asks. 'Like my new friends,' Simon says. 'There's more than one?' 'Six.' 'They won't grow up either?' Laura asks. Simon looks at her. 'They can't,' he says Simon leads Laura in a game to discover clues, a game he and his friends have invented. Suddenly the game is foreboding. 'You're not my mother!' Simon screams at Laura. 'Who told you that?' she asks, stricken that this little boy, her son, is facing something she and her husband were waiting to tell him when he was older. 'My friend told me,' Simon says. 'What friend?' 'Tomas,' Simon yells, crying and defiant. 'Tomas told me the truth, that I'm just like them.... I have no mother or father and I'm going to die.' Days later, Simon disappears, apparently kidnapped. The parents, with Laura increasingly frantic, try everything to find him. In time, there will only be Laura and this moldering stone mansion where she was raised as an orphan with other orphans. We begin to learn what happened there when Laura as a child left. So...whose imagination, whose story are we inhabiting? 'Horror' is a term that has been debased in the movies over the last thirty years or so. Technology and computers have eliminated most of the need for imagination and the kind of dread we make for ourselves out of little things. Market research drives so many creative decisions into the dead end of splatter and special effects. The Orphanage is just slightly a horror movie. It is lonely, deliberative, sad, thoughtful, even quiet, even, surprisingly, with a degree of contentment at the conclusion. All the actors do fine jobs, and there is a notably quiet and intense performance by Geraldine Chaplin as a psychic whose own death is near. It is Belen Rueda as Laura who helps make this movie something special. There are so many opportunities for intense 'acting,' distraught 'acting,' tearful 'acting.' Rueda does nothing of this. We believe her as Laura because she doesn't try to over-dramatize Laura. Laura is often intense and sometimes distraught. She also puzzles through this mystery, is determined to find her son and can take action. But Rueda never overacts. Thanks to Rueda's performance and fine directing and screen writing, I think The Orphanage establishes itself as an unusual and intriguing movie.",9,2,5,7 February 2009
The Lives of Others," A sad, thoughtful and redemptive film
","The Lives of Others (Das Leben der Anderen) is one of the best films I've seen in a long, long time. It's sad, thoughtful and redemptive, and it deals with major themes. We're in East Germany a few years before the fall of the Berlin wall. The Stasi are everywhere, watching everyone and punishing in brutal or subtle ways anyone who might be even an implied threat to the government. Their greatest tool is the system of informers that reaches everywhere, people who may relay indiscretions to the Stasi because they believe in what they are doing, but more often are compromised into doing so. People are given terrible choices to either work with the Stasi as informers or see their careers or their children's futures destroyed. One-third of the East German population is kept under Stasi surveillance. Everyone, it seems, is being watched by someone. Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) is a playwright who has made his accommodations with the regime, has won awards and has learned not to go too far. The mere fact that he is seen as reliable makes him a subject of Stasi interest. That, and because his lover, the actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), is coveted by a powerful official who wants Dreyman ruined. Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe), a dedicated, colorless Stasi officer, noted for his reliability and interrogation skills, is assigned the job of monitoring Dreyman. This means installing bugs in Dreyman's apartment where Dreyman lives with Sieland, setting up 24 hour monitoring, recording everything and preparing reports. Wiesler takes his share of listening in. Wiesler seems to have no purpose but his dedication to the ideals of the East German system, but even he can see the corruption of those ideals. He has no friends to speak of except his boss, who knows which way the wind can shift. Dreyman, on the other hand, is a handsome man of talent who loves Christa and who has seen a close friend and talented director banned from the theater for speaking too clearly. Dreyman gradually finds the conscience he had put on hold in order to be successful. Wiesler gradually finds himself, through listening in, drawn to an awareness of the compromises and corruption he knows has seeped into a system he once believed in. Even more subtly, he finds himself drawn into the lives of Dreyman and Christa-Maria. Slowly, cautiously and anonymously, Wiesler begins to protect Dreyman. All the while we are witness to the pervasive spying on people, the pettiness, the corruption of authority, the use of subtle threats to keep people in line, the almost comic meticulousness of the Stasi and their obsessive record keeping on everyone. The conclusion of the film brings us well past the fall of the Berlin wall, when the full evidence of Stasi spying and the corruption of so many to be informers became evident. We see what happened to both Dreyman and Wiesler. I found the ending to be very, very emotional. This was director von Donnersmarck's first feature film. He also was the writer. The acting is just as good as the film, particularly Muhe, Koch and Gedeck. Muhe has perhaps the toughest job. He has to show us this dedicated functionary first relentlessly breaking a suspect through calm, psychological questioning, then gradually, gradually letting us see Wiesler's doubts and humanity as he listens into to the lives of Dreyman and Sieland. Muhe makes us aware of Wiesler's changing outlook no faster than Weisler becomes aware of them himself. It's a subtle, strong performance.",10,4,5,6 February 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Get to know Harry Potter, his friends and teachers, first in the books, then enjoy the movies. This movie is fine
","If Harry Potter at the conclusion of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix feels sorry for Voldemort because the dark lord can never know love or friendship, I feel almost equally sorry for those who don't read J. K. Rowling's novels and just rely on the films. As good as the movies are, including this one, they are scarcely more than sketches compared to the books. Why should this be important? Because Rowling has created a classic epic with the books, and stuffed them full of mature ideas, boundless ingenuity and clever humor, life lessons that aren't preachy or icky and with characters we come to really like or detest. No, this isn't Dickens, but as a literary tour de force, the story of Harry Potter and his growth into adulthood is unusually vivid and satisfying. The Order of the Phoenix isn't simply the exciting adventure, tinged with a bit of mystery and dread, that the other books and films were. With this one, the angst, worry and danger move front and center. The movie still works as entertainment, however, because it's not a stand- alone film. Those who may try to judge the relative worth of any one of the books or films needs to take into account that Harry Potter is one story, and each story in each book or movie builds on all the others before it. For me, trying to figure which is the 'best' book or film would be like trying to determine which bite of pumpkin pie was most satisfying, the third bite, the fourth bite or the first bite. The movies, especially this one, do provide one satisfaction that the books can't. Before our eyes, literally, Harry Potter and his friends are growing up, changing from children to young men and women. We see it happen because all the original young actors, who must have signed long-term contracts or are getting a great deal of money to sign up picture by picture, also are growing up before our eyes. Harry Potter is now a young man because Daniel Radcliffe is becoming a young man. Hermione Granger's growing maturity is because Emma Watson is growing in maturity. It's odd in a pleasurable way to see small Neville Longbottom now towering over Harry, just as Mathew Lewis now towers over Radcliffe. Rowling's books are so good, and the movies are so accomplished as good cinema, that the 'Oh, no, I'd never read those Potter stories' reaction set in sometime ago and is still prevalent among some. There is a category of individuals who automatically react condescendingly to anything which achieves great popular success. This isn't intellectual prejudice. Those who enjoy things of the mind - intellectuals - are driven as much by curiosity as by an appreciation of what rigorous things a mind can deliver. Those, however, who shiver in delight at Sondheim and only smile indulgently at Berlin, who swoon over Updike but find Dickens just adequate, who condescend to Rowling but preen over Goddard, miss the point: A good mind, a fine intellect, a curious person can find pleasure and value in all of the above. Why? Because they're all good at what they do. Intellectual appreciation of good work isn't a zero sum game. See the Potter movies, including this one, and be touched and entertained. Read the Potter books, including this one, and be touched and taught.",8,0,2,27 January 2008
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," A brutal, sad, powerful film of the Irish rebellion against the British, and the civil war that followed
","Ireland in the early Twenties exploded into armed rebellion against the British. Two brothers at first made opposite decisions. A group of Black and Tan British soldiers arrive at a farm where the brothers and a group of other young men are resting after a field hockey game. The British terrorize everyone there, the men, the women, the aged and the young. They beat and kill one man for refusing to give his name in English. When they roar off, one brother, Teddy (Padraic Delaney), immediately helps form the men into armed resistors. Damien (Cillian Murphy), a medical student, decides to go on to London to a prestigious medical school where he is enrolled to finish his studies. At the train station he witnesses another group of soldiers attack and beat the train's conductor and engineer. The attacks are filled with screams and rifle butts. Damien returns to the village and joins the armed resistors. From then on we're in the middle of a rag-tag guerilla war, driven by a stern sense of justice and a determination to force the British out of Ireland. The British use wide-spread intimidation, brutality, imprisonment and executions by courts martial. Some of the men we've met die, British soldiers die, hostages die, traitors die, a young friend of Damien's who gave information is executed by Damien. He slowly moves from a reluctant fighter to a man who has become single-minded in what he does. When a truce is declared and a peace treaty is finally agreed upon in 1922 between the British Government and Sinn Fein, the stark reality of compromise splits the fighters. On the one hand, there will be an Irish Free State with British troops withdrawn. On the other hand, it will be a member of the British Commonwealth, an oath of allegiance to the British crown will be required and Northern Ireland will remain an integral part of Britain. Is this what we fought for...to give allegiance to the British, many ask? What we fought for was independence and in most regards we have it, say others. Ireland must be whole, say some. If we don't agree the British will flood the island with their troops, say others. We watch a civil war begin, with Irishmen taking up arms and killing each other. For the brothers, who once fought the British together, it means a crucial split. One fights to put down the rebellion against the newly independent Irish state, the other vows to fight until all Ireland is completely free. One critic of the film said that 'there isn't much nuance to either side.' That's probably because, nurtured by terrible actions and long memories, there wasn't much nuance in real life. The Wind That Shapes the Barley is a sad, powerful and emotional film. It doesn't shy away from the brutality and torture by British soldiers or the ruthlessness of the armed response. Most of all, we come face to face with both the courage and the grime needed by the Irish to finally, after centuries of ruthless, condescending oppression, rid most of the island of the British. The acting is uniformly persuasive, especially by Murphy and Delaney as the two brothers. Cillian Murphy, in particular gives a subtle and mesmerizing performance. The brothers' fate may not be tragic but it is so sad it makes you reflect on what you've seen. That's not a bad thing. Each brother in his own way pays for the choices he makes.And the title? It's from a 19th Century poem that tells of a young Irish boy who soon will leave his sweetheart to join others fighting the English in the 1798 rebellion. They would carry barley in their pockets as provisions on the march. When they were slain and their bodies pitched into unmarked mass graves by the English, from their bodies the sprouting barley came to symbolise that Irish resistance to the British would never die. I sat within the valley green, I sat me with my true love My sad heart strove the two between, the old love and the new love The old for her, the new that made me think on Ireland dearly While soft the wind blew down the glen and shook the golden barley 'Twas hard the woeful words to frame to break the ties that bound us But harder still to bear the shame of foreign chains around us And so I said, 'The mountain glen I'll seek at morning early And join the bold united men,' while soft winds shake the barleyWhile sad I kissed away her tears, my fond arms round her flingingA yeoman's shot burst on our ears from out the wildwood ringingA bullet pierced my true love's side in life's young spring so early And on my breast in blood she died while soft winds shook the barley I bore her to some mountain stream, and many's the summer blossom I placed with branches soft and green about her gore-stained bosomI wept and kissed her clay-cold corpse then rushed o'er vale and valley My vengeance on the foe to wreak while soft wind shook the barley But blood for blood without remorse I've taken at Oulart Hollow And laid my true love's clay cold corpse where I full soon may follow As round her grave I wander drear, noon, night and morning early With breaking heart when e'er I hear the wind that shakes the barley.",9,1,7,3 February 2008
The Good Shepherd," A good effort by director De Niro, but not, in my opinion, particularly successful
","It's always a disappointment when a movie that tries as hard as this one does, and is as well- crafted, doesn't quite make it. The Good Shepherd is not a failure, yet in my opinion it tries to do so much that it loses focus. Ostensibly, the movie is the tale of Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), a serious and honorable Yale graduate who is recruited into the OSS at the start of WWII, learns his way around counter-intelligence, moves on to the CIA when it is formed and eventually becomes a single-minded CIA executive. The Bay of Pigs fiasco serves as a framing device for Wilson's story. Wilson, De Niro wants to show us, was a thoughtful, sensitive young man, deeply affected by his father's suicide, drawn to poetry, who through the years loses his soul, his family and his conscience to the pursuit of America's enemies. In the well-over two hours running time, the movie gives us episode after episode from Wilson's life...the Skull and Bones rigamarole for Yale's superior people, the betrayal of a poetry professor not once, but twice, young love and young love that ends in pregnancy and a marriage, the recruiting and protection of ex-Nazis, the disintegration of his family life, ruthless activities by our side and by the other side, expedient murders, interrogation by simulating drowning and intra-agency maneuvering. Through it all Matt Damon does a fine job of portraying Wilson as a man increasingly shut off from everything but his suspicions, his own definition of honor and his patriotism. What are we to make of all this? Are we to think that some of the things the CIA does are awful? Or that defense of the country can lead to paranoia? Or that some people can be corrupted by the rationalization needed to do bad things? De Niro, I think, wanted to make all these themes a part of his movie, but he was unable to clearly define what he felt. The movie itself has been given a first-rate production. It features all sorts of well-known actors, perhaps too many for its own good. Popping up in various roles are Angelina Jolie, Alec Baldwin, Billy Crudup, Joe Pesci, Michael Gambon, William Hurt, John Turturro, Keir Dullea and Robert Hutton. Some, such as Jolie, Pesci and Baldwin, are good in their parts but their star recognition factor, for me, was distracting. Some, such as Hurt and Crudup, give excellent performances. And one, Michael Gambon, practically gives lessons to the others on what great, subtle acting is all about. He dominates the scenes he is in, and this doesn't serve Damon (or Wilson well) as Gambon's scenes all involve Damon. De Niro, for me, also falls into that old Hollywood trap of being all to ready to sacrifice narrative coherence in order to achieve a 'wow' effect or to protect his stars. There are two or three murders, one suicide and one graphic scene of torture. In each case, the effect is to make us jump unexpectedly with the 'wow' factor. But in each case, a reasonable person could say to themselves, why did they kill that person that way? Wouldn't it have been easier and more in keeping with the themes of the movie to do it more quietly? And in each case the answer is, 'Yes,' but then we'd have missed the 'wow.' After awhile, this desire for the 'wow' keeps reminding us we're watching another big, Hollywood movie. At another level, there is almost no character development. We're supposed to see Edward Wilson as initially young, sensitive and honorable. But we don't. We're simply told he is. From the minute we see Wilson as a poetry major at Yale, Damon plays him as a closed-in personality. That's the way he starts and that's the way he finishes. He may or may not long for a young woman he meets, but he marries (the honorable thing to do) another young woman when she becomes pregnant. But is he the least bit passionate about the first? Who knows? Is it such a sacrifice to marry the second? Who knows? During WWII we meet John Turturro as a smart-mouthed enlisted man, fairly contemptuous of authority, assigned to a young Edward Wilson. Twenty years later we watch as he does the Sixties equivalent of water-boarding a man who may be a Soviet double agent. What happened in between to turn Turturro's character from a rebel to a torturer? Who knows? Just as disconcerting is that none of the characters age over nearly thirty years. Jolie gets a little dark shadow under her eyes, but that's about it. Damon, Hurt, Baldwin and all the others don't gain any weight, lose any hair, earn any wrinkles or have their jaw lines blur. This is Hollywood, and after a while De Niro allows this to undermine the seriousness he was aiming for. For me, The Good Shepherd tries to do too much and tries too hard, and isn't able to cast off those tell-tale Hollywood star habits. Still, it's by no means a failure. Many will probably find it more meaningful and enjoyable than I did.",7,1,2,18 February 2008
The Queen," A stunning and complex portrayal of Elizabeth II by the incomparable Helen Mirren
","What an incredible comedy of manners and position this is. Yet it manages a conclusion which is touching. Diana dies. The British public (and many elsewhere) go into a genuine spasm of grief. The Queen (Helen Mirren) and the royals completely misread the situation and are determined to keep things private with no undignified displays of emotion. They are such a conventional, mundane family. Plus, of course, they detested Diana. Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), newly in as Prime Minister, reads the situation correctly but has to find a way to bring the Queen to understand the seriousness of how the public is beginning to react to her remoteness. And it's all inside stuff. The Queen is portrayed as absolutely clueless at first, a product of her upbringing, a captive of what she feels 'duty' is. Emotionally, she is so closed in...so 'English'...that one can realize what a repressed childhood Charles must have had with a bully for a father and a mother unable to express love easily. Philip is not just a bully, he is full of blustering royal certitude. Charles is well-intentioned, more intuitive than you'd think and weak. Blair is irritatingly ingratiating but right. Cherie Blair, his wife, is an anti-monarchist with sharp teeth, an unpleasant piece of work. It's a lot of fun.",8,0,1,3 March 2008
La Vie En Rose," An extraordinary performance by Marion Cotillard in an extraordinary film about the life of Edith Piaf
","I wouldn't be comfortable calling La Vie en Rose (La Mome), the life of Edith Piaf, one of the great biographical films until I have a chance to see it once or twice more. What I'm sure of is that Marion Cotillard's portrayal of Piaf from Piaf's early teens until Piaf died at 47 is one of the most extraordinary performances I've ever seen on a movie screen. Piaf had an extraordinary life, was an extraordinary personality as well as being perhaps France's greatest singer. Cotillard simply remakes herself into this willful, self-destructive, selfish, generous, melodramatic, tiny creature -- Piaf was only 4' 8' tall -- of dramatic vocal genius. Piaf grew up on the streets of Paris. Her life was one crises after another, some of her making, some not. We meet her as a child, when her mother abandoned her. Her father, a soldier in WWI and a contortionist in small traveling circuses, disappeared for long period of time. At one point before puberty she lived for quite a while with her paternal grandmother, who ran a brothel. She helped her father work at one of those circuses. They survived as street entertainers in Paris. She finally had enough and struck out on her own, making a little money singing on the streets, giving much of it to a local pimp for protection. She had a child who died of meningitis. When she was 20 she was discovered by an 'impresario' who ran a nightclub. Louis Leplee renamed her Piaf. When he was murdered in what seemed to be a gang hit, she was put through the public wringer by the police and the French press. Her fame grew. During WWII she agreed to sing at POW camps so the French prisoners could be photographed with Piaf by the Germans as evidence of how happy the prisoners were. Piaf was a member of the Resistance. She took copies of the photographs and arranged for the Resistance to make false passports for 150 prisoners. She returned to the camps with the passports and managed to have them distributed to the prisoners under the eyes of the Germans. She was either fearless or willfully fatalistic. The Germans never seemed to realize what this tiny, internationally known singer was doing. After the war, she was acclaimed. She had famous love affairs, including Yves Montand and French middleweight boxer Marcel Cerdan. Cerdan, whom she loved, was killed in a plane crash. She drank heavily, took drugs, and her health continued to deteriorate. She suffered from rheumatism, severe arthritis, a liver that barely functioned. She became addicted to morphine and continued to drink heavily. And she sang and sang and sang. She could make a child's jump-rope song sound like an obsession to lost love. Piaf had a big voice and she knew how to use it. She preferred simple black dresses and a spotlight when she performed, creating a highly dramatic image of this small, sad face and her two expressive hands. Her songs were about love, loss, death, memories, hope that was glimmering and hope that had died. She had a vibrato that seemed to throb in the heart. When she died at 47, the drink and the drugs, the losses and tragedies, the self-destructive willfulness and the arthritis had turned her into the ruined shell of the teen-ager who sang on Paris streets. Not a life I would have wanted, even if I'd traded for her talent, but it was her life and it became a huge melodrama powered by her unique voice. For Americans, perhaps her most familiar song is La Vie En Rose. With Mack David's soppy lyrics, there was a time when it couldn't be avoided, including Piaf's French version. But the song that evokes the most memories, and the one that closes the movie and summarizes her life, is the song Piaf first sang just three years before her death, 'Non, je ne regrette rien.' The song roughly translates as 'I don't regret a thing. What has happened has happened and has been paid for. Neither the good done to me, nor the bad: To me, they're all the same. No, I regret nothing. Because my life, because my joys, today, begin with you.' The movie La Vie en Rose is dramatically and almost lushly photographed. We don't have a simple linear story line; we keep moving back and forth among the times of her life. The juxtapositions between the child, the girl, the young woman, the star, the prematurely aged force of talent and willfulness, makes us need to pay attention but it also gives us some idea of the chaos of her life. Marion Cotillard is incredible as she makes us believe in this self- destructive and fascinating person. We really forget about Cotillard and can only focus on this tiny body, big voice and an odd, appealing face made up of huge eyes, blood red lips, and plucked, thin-lined eye-brows. Personally, self-destruction after awhile makes me impatient and irritated. There are too many things to do to waste one's life on a diet of willfulness and selfishness, even if one is gifted with huge talent. I was mesmerized by Piaf, her life and her songs, but at times I felt like telling her to ease up on the drama. I suppose, given her life, much should be forgiven or at least understood. As Roger Ebert has said, 'Nothing in her early life taught her to count on permanence or loyalty. What she counted on was singing, champagne, infatuation and morphine.' La Vie en Rose is a movie well worth seeing.",8,1,3,31 January 2008
Saboteur," Not bad, but let's play make believe: James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan and Claude Raines
","Saboteur might be less than prime Hitchcock, but it has its moments; in fact, quite a few of them, in my opinion. Where it falls apart, however, is in an essential part of any movie...the leads, including the villain. Hitchcock usually was able to come up with interesting villains. Just think of James Mason, Robert Walker, Joseph Cotton, the never seen Rebecca, Paul Lukas, Ray Milland, Herbert Marshall or Claude Raines. In his best films, if he didn't have a charismatic villain he had such charismatic leads - Grant, Olivier, Donat, Bergman, Stewart, for example, that it didn't make much difference With Saboteur, we have as the male lead Robert Cummings, a pleasant actor, a fine light comedian but, in drama, just earnest, bland and conscientious. His partner here is Priscilla Lane, long forgotten but reasonably popular back then. She's a nice young woman, an adequate actor and not very interesting. Neither of them has any spark of self-irony and there's not bit of measurable sexual voltage. As a villain we have the always reliable Otto Kruger, mister smoothie himself. I've always enjoyed watching Kruger. He was predictable but completely professional. Put the three of them together and we have a film where we really don't care what happens to anybody. It's the set-ups and some of the set pieces that had better hold our interest. In other words, we have Saboteur. Try to imagine an alternate universe where Saboteur, with the same script (maybe without the talky and corny bits) and same scenes, now starred James Stewart or Robert Donat, Margaret Sullavan or Madeleine Carroll (Hitchcock evidently wanted Sullavan) and Claude Raines or Godfrey Tearle. Now that might be one of Hitchcock's classics, or at least something on the charming, dangerous level as Foreign Correspondent. But back to reality. Barry Kane (Cummings), just a guy from Glendale, California, gets involved in a horrendous fire at the aircraft factory where he works, a fire caused by a traitor and where his best friend is killed. It looks to the police that Barry is responsible. He takes off to save himself and find out what really is going on. All he has to go on is the address on a letter he saw at work when he handed it back to a man he thought was another plant worker, a man named Frank Fry (Norman Lloyd). In short order Barry is on the road to Springville, California, and the home of the rich and gracious Charles Tobin (Otto Kruger), then, after a perilous escape while wearing handcuffs, to a house in the woods. There he meets Pat Martin (Lane), who doesn't believe his story, and her blind uncle, who does. Then it's off to desolate Soda City (with Pat; she changed her mind), then to New York City and to a grand ball filled with traitors mixed in with the rich and patriotic. Finally we arrive at the high point of the movie... a tense ship launching, a shootout in a crowded movie house (with Veda Ann Borg on the screen) and a dangerous, high tension scramble up the Statue of Liberty, a tearing coat and a backward, face up, fall. Even with the weaknesses of the leads, Hitchcock gives us some entertaining moments...a leap off a high bridge and a struggle in a river torrent, a nighttime meeting with circus folks of all shapes, sizes, weights and degrees of hairiness, the desolate ghost town that's Soda City, Alma Kruger and her white tie society ball and, of course, the Statue of Liberty. Stewart, Sullavan and Raines would have been terrific. So would be watching again The 39 Steps.",6,1,2,30 June 2008
