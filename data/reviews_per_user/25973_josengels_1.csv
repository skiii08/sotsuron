Black Swan," Good movie until 20 minutes before the end..
","The build-up of the story is reasonable, but is spoiled when the insanity of the ballerina is not filmed properly. The audience sees her as a black swan with wings etc, but this was only in her own mind, and should have been filmed from her eye-view only. The audience should see her as a normally dressed dancer. The ending, where she is supposed to have danced the whole scene with a self-inflicted wound in her stomach, which only starts bleeding after she takes the fall onto the mattress, is ridiculous. It is disappointing to sit through the whole movie, expecting an emotional climax towards the end, only to walk out of the cinema wondering how the reputation of Oscar-nominee was built up..",5,3,5,28 February 2011
