The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," A good slow burn
","I've read the books and I was prepared to see this movie as a slow burn because splitting the third book in two parts wasn't the best idea.Mockingjay was my least favourite book and it's also very slow at the beginning but it doesn't mean the movie sucked. In fact, I was pretty much amazed by how they made it entertaining compared to the book. The writing is great, the acting is perfect and it is even better than the book. The problem is that the people who didn't read the book won't really like this movie because of what they were expecting after seeing the second movie.",10,7,16,24 March 2015
The Hunger Games," Really good movie
","Okay let make things clear. First of all, I really enjoyed this movie it was so well done! Everything that was important was here. But there were also things that made me a little bit sad but I totally understand why they changed things.Second, after seeing this movie, I have to say to those people who didn't read the books, it will be a little bit hard to understand. I don't think I would of understand it clearly if I didn't read the book seriously. And I also have to admit that the shaky camera was a little bit annoying in the beginning but then it was less shaky. Still, they did a wonderful job and stayed true to the books.Then, even if there were changes, I don't think there would be any better way to do it. If you really didn't like the changes, than tell me how would you do this? It's not that easy at all. Plus, since the book is written in Katniss' point of view it is harder to 'convert' it into a movie. So, they made it perfectly and there were scenes that I imagined the way they did it.Finally, The Hunger Games movie is an amazing movie, it has a little bit of all. Even if this movie doesn't look like a funny movie, they did have a little bit funny scenes with Haymitch. And there is also violence but they tried to not put too much blood in it. Well, I really enjoyed this movie and even wish it was a longer...",10,7,23,23 March 2012
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Exciting, surprising and overwhelming.
","To be honest, I knew this movie was going to be better than the first one which disappointed me. The change of the director definitely made a difference and we all can see it. It was a good change though. Many good fans who read the trilogy loved the second book and this movie did a really good job at it. They've put every important scenes and even a slice of modification on specific things that Gary Ross didn't do correctly (I am talking about Buttercup the cat and even Madge). I was impressed by the CGI which was way better than the first one and of course there was no more shaky-cam. The story overall is as rich in content as the book and is absolutely amazing. The actors are incredible and yes I knew Jennifer Lawrence would be terrific but the actor who surprised me was Jena Malone because she made her character look more bad-ass than the book. I couldn't find any problem with the movie except maybe they cut off some parts of the book but I can totally understand that. I just hope Mockingjay will be as good as this one or even better if they can! Thank you Francis Lawrence for bringing back The Hunger Games into something serious and real.",10,2,22,5 December 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," Weird movie?....
","I don't really understand why it has a good rate...8,2? Really? I went to see this movie and I didn't read any reviews or anything I just watched the trailer. The beginning was good, the dialogue are funny and all but...I was so disappointed by the end... it's not a horror movie at all. So I have read some reviews here and still don't understand why it is a good horror movie???!? Maybe it was a funny movie, okay, I admit that, but no a good horror movie... It wasn't that scary and I'm a pussy when I watch a horror movie! Plus, at the end I got so confused. What's the thing with the gods? That was a little bit weird... It looked like they didn't know what to put in the end and that's what they got...gods ending the world. Entertaining and funny yes! But not horror at all and disappointing ending. At least, Joss Whedon will convince me that he is a good director when I will watch The Avengers, because I'm pretty sure that this one will be good.",5,5,14,20 April 2012
