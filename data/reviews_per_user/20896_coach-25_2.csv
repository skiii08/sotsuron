Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not so Menacing
","After you saw the original starwars in 1977, you left the theater with a good feeling. After seeing Phantom Menace, you left the theater asking yourself many questions. Why didn't Qui Gonn disappear after his death? Who were the trade federation and why was it so important to takeover the planet of Naboo? Why couldn't Yoda and the Jedi council detect the presence of a sith? What's the story with Senator Palpatine and his secret identity (darth sidious), where did he come from, and what are his intentions? I'm sure some of these questions will be answered in episode 2, but why make us wait? Obviously  this film was more of a setup to the rest of the episodes, rather an all-time classic the media built it up to be. Here are some more questions: Why bring back JarJar Binks in episode 2, if he was hated so much in ep1? Almost everybody who saw Ep1 couldn't stand him, he was so annoying. Another question: Is it really necessary to include so much digital effects in a movie, if the whole point to a movie is to tell a story? George obviously got carried away with the power of ILM.Here's my final question: How did George manage to screw up this movie when he had so much time to write a script, and he had ILM at his disposal?  You just know at the end of episode 2, there will be more unanswered questions.I just hope the next two episodes will be better.",10,0,1,12 January 2001
Mission: Impossible II," John Woo must think we're stupid
","I haven't seen all of John Woo's movies, but I've seen enough (Hard Boiled, FaceOff, Broken Arrow, MI2). In all his movies, there seems to be the same old stuff: good guy vs bad guy, guns, explosions, stunts...). All that is nice, but we've seen it all before. Enter Mission: Impossible 2. I was hoping for something new from John Woo, boy was I wrong. Same old stuff: heavy on action, weak on plot, characters. If this is the best John Woo can come up with, tell him not to waste our time or money again. We've seen this all before, lets see something with some heart, instead of the same old thing. A good action movie must have more besides just action.",Null,0,0,21 June 2000
