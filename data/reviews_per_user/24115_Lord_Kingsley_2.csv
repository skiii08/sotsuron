The Benchwarmers," Typical...
","I suffered through this movie at the behest of a couple friends of mine. I had to because I never would have seen this movie on my own. It was one of the stupidest films I've ever seen. It was your typically retarded gross-out comedy (and I use the term loosely, as I laughed, I think, a total of three times). They certainly didn't waste any time getting to the fart jokes, the first one coming within two minutes of the start of the film. John Heder reprised his 'Napoleon Dynamite' role which is something I think he'll be doing for the rest of his career. Rob Schnider's character is surprisingly tame. The only laughs came from David Spade's usual dry sense of humor, but even those laughs were few and far between. Even with Adam Sandler as executive producer, I think I expected too much. A waste of money even at the dollar theater.",2,0,1,4 June 2006
Ghost Rider," Worse Than Batman and Robin...
","I saw this movie (as with 'The Benchwarmers') at the behest of my best friend who usually has pretty good cinematic tastes. These tastes have gone downhill in recent years and this concerns me. We may have to have a movie intervention for him, but that's another story.I suppose if you're into movies where the dialog consists of 'I'm gonna kick your butt' / 'I don't think so' for about two hours, you won't be disappointed in 'Ghost Rider.' The script, which sounds like a fanfic written by a seventh grader, is simplistic enough to hold the attentions of even the most ADD-riddled viewer. So much so, that it seems implausible that Cage's Johnny Blaze (a well thought out name if ever there was one) would have the knowledge necessary to understand the theology books that are central to the plot. Maybe he just saw the bitchin' pictures and pieced it together in his head.While the script is the movie's biggest problem, there are several others that make a bad situation even worse. Such as the terribly long pacing, the XBox-worthy CGI effects and the wooden performances of all actors involved. Particularly those of the comely love interest Roxanne Simpson, a roving reporter who seemingly got through Journalism School by her cleavage alone. Sam Elliot makes a cameo in an attempt to bring a bit of dignity to the film, but all he does is spout some faux-religious bunk about the Ghost Rider being the Devil's gofer. You'd think by now, somebody would have just challenged him to a fiddle contest by now. It would have been more interesting to watch.Also of note is the movie's anti-smoking message, which is more heavy-handed than anything truth.com could have come up with. Young Johnny's father smokes Marlboros and is dead five minutes later. However, in a later scene, many of Blaze's friends are seen playing poker and smoking Lucky Strikes. The moral of the story: smoking Marlboros will kill you. So will this movie. Especially if you payed to see it. Wait for it to come out on DVD and play 'Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Home Game' with it.",1,3,11,17 February 2007
