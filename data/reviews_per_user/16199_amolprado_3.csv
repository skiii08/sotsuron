Men in Black 3," New Wine in A Old Bottle But Overall Entertaining.....!
","Finally A Gap of 10 Years MIB 3 is come n Actor Will Smith Also Coming on Screen after 4 Years.. His Last Movie i Seen in 2008 'Seven Punds'.. b4 going i Was Having Great Expectations From 'MIB3', n After Seen Somehow m Totally Entertain, Watching Specially Visual Effects in 3D. Absolutely Fantastic.First Half is Simply Superb. But in the second Half there is few moments You'll Feel bored specially in Last Moments. Movie starts with a Bang Action Scenes. Not Very Interesting Story this time Because Story Zooms 40 Year Back in Past. Chemistry Between Will Smith As Agent J n Tommy Lee Jones As Agent K Is Awesome, With Together They Both r Very Funny. You Can't Compare Josh Brolin As Young Agent K with Tommy Lee Jones. He is A Fine Actor n He Delivered Good Performance.Director Barry Sonnenfeld Did a Decent Job This time. His Direction is Outstanding. Because Story is Not Very Great But Still He Manages Audience Movie Watchable Through Comedy n Action Scenes Specially in 3D. Movies Length also Very Good With 1 Hour 45 Minute Movie. From the Whole Cast 'Will Smith' as Agent J is Top Class. He is a Brilliant Actor n Very Funny in Movie, n Watching Him on Screen After a Long time is Very Fabulous Experience. 'Tommy Lee Jones As Agent K' is Also Very Good but His Role is Very Small. 'Josh Brolin As Young Agent K' Also Delivered Good Performance. But The Real Funny Character in the MIB3 is the Villain 'Jemaine Clement As Boris the Animal' He is d Best in the Movie. His Performance also Spectacular. But Ending is Very Difficult to Understand. Director Confuses us in d Ending by showing Repeated Scenes. Finally My Rating is For MIB 3 is 7 Out of 10.. it's Funny, Action n Simply d Best. Highly Recommended ...! Don't Miss... !",7,1,4,26 May 2012
The Hunger Games," This is Very Slow n Steady Drama Which Longer 142 Minutes.With Few Action Scenes.
","I was Having Great Expectations for this Movie, but After Seen m Totally disappointed. Let me Tell u Frankly This is not an Action Movie, This is Very Slow n Steady Drama Which Longer 142 Minutes With Few Action Scenes. If u Thinking This is Action Thriller Like Movies 'The Condemned 2007' n 'The Tournament 2009' then u Must Stay out of it. in fact this Two Movies will give u Good Entertainment than this. Jennifer Lawrence Delivered Good performance. in First Half U'll feel Bored due to it's Screenplay. in Gaming Action Thrillers Japanese Movie 'Battle Royale 2000' is My Favourite Movie. A Very Good Opportunity is Wasted by Director Gary Ross. I think Critics Just Overrated This Movie. My Rating For This Movie 1 Out of 10.Avoid it. Still Lots of Good Movies in Summer is Yet to Come.",1,21,35,28 March 2012
