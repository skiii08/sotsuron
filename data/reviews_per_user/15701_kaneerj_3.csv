The Longest Yard," my favorite movie of all time
","this was my favorite movie of all time, it was really funny, really entertaining, has a great story, it kept me entertained the whole way, I loved watching him recruit the players and put the team together, I like football but watched it with some friends who hate football or know nothing about football and they loved this movie also",10,0,1,28 October 2017
Passengers," i wish i was in the situation
","great unique movie, if i was in chris pratts situation in reall life it would have been a dream come, i would have just awaken all the girls and turned it into my own playboy party mansion but with a ship, 2500 girls and just me at the one guy, i could live my remaining years living the ultimate dream, but as for the movie itself,.i thought it was great just at the end i thought it should have shown great flashbacks of all their life and years together before they died, probably also should have had a kid together, but he would been without a partner so better they did not. but anyways it kept me entertained the whole way.",8,12,23,28 December 2016
Thor: Ragnarok," really entertaining movie
","this movie was nearly perfect, we all know it is really good with good fight scenes and good jokes so ill point out some of the things did made it a 9 instead of a 10, I think the wolf caused more terror before dying as he didn't even kill 1 person the whole movie and the wolf and hulk fight was way to short and ended very effortlessly with the wolf just falling off the waterfall, I think it should have been more intense and they could have had the hulk kill him in a much more gruesome legit way like ripping his jaw off or something, the ending fight with hella was pretty good but could have been a lot better, they could have had hulk and thor and loki team up to push or throw hela into the sword strike of the giant demon surtur to show a much more sure gruesome death rather then a supposed death of hela where the big surtur did pretty much all the work besides needing loki and thor to bring him back to life. but overall no movie can be perfect and this movie was close enough.",9,1,11,4 November 2017
