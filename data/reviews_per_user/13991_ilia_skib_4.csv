Requiem for a Dream," Words can not express...
","Words can not express... I have just finished watching this film and can't shake of the shock it caused. I have stared at an empty screen for 5 minutes, not able even to cry... This is one (if not THE) of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. And believe me I am very picky. Never had been inhumanity towards human weaknesses displayed in such a brutal honest and shocking way. On the one hand shattered dreams that brought into your mind and soul almost physically. And on the other had the sadness for one of the most painful problems in the world : drugs and the way people deal with drug addicts.First the acting: UNBELIEVABLE!!!The characters, which are so complex and yet so simple, are brought by the actors absolutely brilliantly. Ellen Burstyn is shocking! Her portrait of a lonely aging lady is genius! So intolerably sad. Jared Leto is great showing a plain guy and goodness that can be betrayed and corrupted buy drugs from the inside and also from the world outside. Jeniffer Connely as a proud uncompromising strong character who becomes the absolute opposite is amazing. The weakest performance is in my opinion by Marlon Wayans who doesn't seem to live his character in a convincing way. But then again, his character doesn't have to offer much.The filming was very original and recreated visually, complex physical and emotional feelings in a way that I haven't yet seen on screen.The soundtrack is also brilliantly selected and with unordinary sound editing adds much to the movie. To sum up: Highly recommended, but be advised - it is one of the most difficult pictures to cope with, mentally.p.s I apologize for any spelling/grammar mistakes",Null,0,1,8 December 2004
Guardians of the Galaxy," Utter boredom
","I wish Hollywood would donate the tremendous amount of money they spent on this film to one village in Africa. Complete and utter mediocre garbage. Even the special effects, which are supposed to be driving movies like that are mediocre. The landscapes, fight scenes are okay, but the CGI characters? Is it so hard to give some detail to expressions in this day and age?This looked like a cartoon (in a bad way) Boring, one dimensional characters and a bunch of people running around in crazy makeup and painted faces. Terrible, just terrible...",1,16,32,10 December 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Generic trash
","The entire plot of this movie could be executed in 20 min. I don't know where to begin. Spoilers ahead...though it doesn't really matter. There is no surprise, no twist.Unimaginative, boring dialogue, rigid acting, no climax. Nothing. The aliens are copies of copies from other movies. The weapons that the human forces use are ridiculous. Nothing like extremely slow moving refrigerator like suits to fight extremely fast moving objects. The main character repeats one single day and in that day he manages to find out all childhood secrets of the soldiers in his squad who meet him for the first time in their lives...But the last 20 min were the 'best'. Our hero apparently develops super human powers without even wearing the metal suit. He can be thrown 50 meters through glass and keeps going like nothing...later he falls into a pit banging repeatedly against rocks, oh yes we should add the signature Tom Cruise scratch on the eyebrow, but otherwise he is fine...Stupid, mindless flick...",1,66,192,3 June 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," Is this a movie or a 2 hour long scene?
","OK...I would give this movie 5 stars, because it deserves it for its cinematography, but the super high ratings have to be balanced...Where do I begin. This is not a movie, this one elongated scene, a visual art clip perhaps. I have seen more substance in 3 min MTV music videos. NO BACKGROUND whatsoever on the history of the tribe depicted in the movie....no character development for the villain whatsoever and there could be SOOOO much. No explanation about any other characters. Main hero is not a main hero ...feels more like a supporting character at best. That, coupled with a completely ridiculously bad acting makes me wonder why the movie even called Mad Max? Dialogue - what dialog? There are probably more words in this review than in the movie. The good - really cool costumes, cars, special effects (though some of them seem cartoonish)... I left the theater feeling like my brain was emptied of thought...this is how dull in terms of story this movie felt. Not even dull...just nothing...emptiness...like the post apocalyptic desert shown in the movie. My advise? Wait for the DVD if you must...not worth spending money on cinema tickets for this and definitely not on IMAX...Unless of course you just like to see stuff blow up and machinery parts flying around.",1,23,56,17 May 2015
