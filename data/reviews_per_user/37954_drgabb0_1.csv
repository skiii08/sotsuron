Sucker Punch," Ridiculous, Incompetent
","So dumb it compelled me to make an IMDb account to write this review...I figured that a fantasy/action movie where schoolgirl babes fight dragons and reanimated Nazis would be light, mindless entertainment. But this flick is straight up boring. There was no pacing, it was (I think a few have pointed this out before) just like a video game. On each level, the girls have to steal some object. Each time, Baby Doll distracts the bad guys with a burlesque dance so the other chicks can grab the it. Each time, the dance takes them one level deeper in the dream, where a dude first briefs them on their mission, which each time is an ultra-saturated slow-mo action sequence fighting some magical enemy. (Besides dragons and Nazis, I think they also fight giant samurais.) They go back to the top-level dream, of course having succeeded. Repeat four times. Wake from the original dream, something something, done. There isn't even any suspense or dramatic irony about the characters' relation to the dream world.I kind of like the Watchowski-brothers-meets-tom-of-Finland, fetish-light motif of Zack Snyder's movies. But in the end they are all just garbage. Totally cynical, lazy and disappointing.",1,3,7,21 July 2011
