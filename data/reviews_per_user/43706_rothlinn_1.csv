Hereditary," Unappreciated by my audience
","Although I felt that the movie was brilliantly acted, twisty and fully engaging, several members of my matinee audience ruined the last fifteen minutes for me. I won't hint what was happening on the screen, but, in the audience, several people were laughing out loud, talking or teeheeing over several segments. To say I was furious would be an understatement. Has anyone else had this experience? How rude and, in my humble opinion, how ignorant and unappreciative of a fine horror film.",Null,1,5,13 June 2018
