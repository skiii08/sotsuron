Mission: Impossible III," Out with a disappointment
","I went to see the movie last night, and I left the theatre with a bad taste in my stomach. Some other commenters were gooshy about the great acting and the romantic plot. Well. I for one just didn't believe it. This is partly because of poor acting, partly bad writing, but in the end is was just mister and miss pretty face.I had the same with the action sequences. One moment a gun seems to have a 500 yard range to shoot down an airplane, while the other our hero has to jump over a large gap to shoot down a heli at 50 yards (and promptly runs out of amno of course).Somewhere in the movie Cruise has to break into a building and it is impossible yada yada and guess what! We don't even see the break-in. If you ask me that is just betrayal of the whole MI franchise.Of course action needs fast pacing, but if you ask me the timing was completely off. Already in the opening sequence the names came too fast, and it didn't get better after that. There were too many distractions for me to enjoy the roller-coaster ride it was meant to be.I am almost done, I promise. There are just some things I want to give a kick at. I really hated the fact that it advertised random violence even when fighting it and the ill-flavoured sauce of Christian family values.The whole movie can be wrapped up in two words: Too Easy",4,8,18,3 May 2006
