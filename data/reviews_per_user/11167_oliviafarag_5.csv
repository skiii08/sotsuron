Raiders of the Lost Ark," Good for its time but lost its charm
","My ex insisted on making me watch this before I went to Cairo because he wanted me to 'relate' to it. Firstly, I'm a girl and I don't think Harrison Ford's antics or his looks or anything else are much to be excited about. The storyline is adventurous but very cliched in a cartoony kind of way and not my cup of tea. Wasn't charmed by the scenes and depiction of Cairo locals.",5,5,9,6 May 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Was Freddie Mercury really this creepy?
","I know very little about Queen so I'm not fussed about the 'inaccuracies in timelines'. I'm just a little disturbed that Freddie Mercury is portrayed as a completely self-obsessed, selfish, self-destructive person while the other 3 band members literally stand by for the first half of the movie smirking / giving hammy reaction shots. We get it, the casting director did a good job of picking actors who look a lot like the band members (except Mercury himself, which is a pity, but Malek tries super hard to embody him). Anyway, this film gave me a better appreciation for their music experimentation and passion for creativity, and that I can respect.",6,1,4,18 March 2019
Aladdin," Will makes the movie worth watching
","Will's energy is infectious and wonderful. I had no probs with the CGI, to me it all blended in perfectly in this action packed movie directed by Guy Ritchie (who also directed Sherlock Holmes which I also love).
I'm not familiar with the actors playing Aladdin and Jasmine, and while they certainly looked the part, their acting was quite stilted and upstaged by the Genie.
I felt like this movie should have been called 'Genie' instead of Aladdin (actually that would a pretty neat idea for a spin-off).",6,3,8,13 June 2019
A Beautiful Mind," A Dirty Mind
","This movie definitely pulls all the punches to be Oscar worthy - a prestigious cast, setting and Director to help give it an air of sophistication. If we are meant to feel compassion towards Russell Crowe's character because 'oh look he is a genius with a mental illness' then unfortunately I did not feel any empathy at all. The script is totally embellished which takes away its credibility. Also, most of what comes out of his mouth hardly warrants a title of 'A Beautiful Mind'. More like A Dirty Mind, a guy who just wants to get laid like everyone else. I didn't see the character doing anything special or significant that seemed 'beautiful' other than scrawling on his windowsill.",5,1,3,21 October 2019
Speed," This is not about the acting but the chemistry
","I rewatched Speed yesterday and still really enjoyed it even though quite a few things sounded dated or cheesy. At the time it came out it was a huge hit because the main leads had really good chemistry, so it didn't matter if the acting or dialogue was cheesy. Adding the civilians to it and getting them involved in the drama made it feel more suspenseful and the tension never wavers in this film, so it goes by surprisingly quick. Don't watch it if you're expecting Oscar worthy performances, just a good action flick to keep you entertained for rainy Sat.",7,2,2,2 December 2019
