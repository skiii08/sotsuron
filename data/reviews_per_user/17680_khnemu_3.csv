Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What's up with the special effects and Jar Jar Binks?
","The 2 things that made my stomach turn in Episode 1 was : 1. There was to much computer made effects, and this is a bad thing because you can clearly see when computerized characters make their appearance. At the end where Jar Jar's people and the trade droids fight it all felt like a very good video game.2. What's up with Jar Jar Binks? Maybe if his voice hadn't been so loud he wouldn't had have ruined half the movie. But the other half of the movie was pretty good, the jedi fights were quite exciting, maybe they shouldn't have stayed on that desert planet for over 40 minutes but anyway. And oh I almost forgot that Anakin kid really sucked (Lucas had 3000 children to pick from and still couldn't find a good one) I mean look at the kids in Kundun those kids could act.",7,0,1,6 September 1999
Alien," Alien it speaks for itself.
","Alien is the perfect science fiction ending of the 70:s. No one has gotten close to that lonely feeling of eternal space and claustophobic panic mix ever since. (well maybe Event Horizon) Superb classic soundtrack and for you guys out there that have not seen it yet, it should serve as a good substitute for you people that thought Star Wars was too childish.",Null,0,1,7 September 1999
Event Horizon," WOW!! One of the best films of the 90:s
","When me and my homies rented this movie I had no expectations what so ever, and when it was done we were speechless!This movie is unlike any other scifi horror film I have ever seen, it mixes the thrilling parts of 'alien' with the same lonely feeling of infinitive space you have in '2001 a space odyssey'. It's very psychological and surprises you several times with it's bizzare twists. The acting is mostly done by Laurence Fishbourne (Apocalypse Now, Matrix) and Sam Elliot (Jurrasic Park, The Hunt For The Red October). Together they make THE best science fiction flick I've seen since Star Wars. And I know I'm not the only one that thinks this movie is superb every person I've asked has said the exact same thing. And therefore I'm having a hard time looking at the grade it got here at IMDB, it should at least scale up to a 7.8. All I can say is this one is goin on my top 100.",9,0,1,12 June 1999
