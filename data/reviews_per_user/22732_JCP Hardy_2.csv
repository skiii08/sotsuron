Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack Of The Awesome!
","Quite a few people were disappointed with The Phantom Menace, but they will not be disappointed with AOTC! Most people back in 1999 when The Phantom Menace came out said it was a disappointment, Me being a HUGE Star Wars fan I loved Phantom Menace I thought it was great! When AOTC came out I Grabbed my ticket,ran into that cinema, sat down in that seat... Then the most amazing thing happened (The screen turned on!!!!) As soon as the lights went out and those memorable 'a long time ago in a galaxy far far away' words came up on that big screen and the good ol' Star Wars music starts playing I felt a chill in my spine a chill of excitement! When I came out of that cinema I just thought it was the coolest movie ever, an that no matter what there will always be a place in my heart for Star Wars Episode II Attack Of The Clones!Excellent!!!I CAN'T WAIT FOR EPISODE III!",10,0,0,26 May 2002
