Despicable Me 2," This movie was way to hyped up
","I think this has to be the worst kids film ever made, It stinks, It's boring, It's not funny at all. Despicable me Is good but this sequel is full of absolute crap. I mean I hated it, do yourself a favor the writer of this film shoot yourself in the face and never ever write another film like this. Also Steve Carrel's voice acting is flipping terrible the German or something of an accent get's annoying and I feel anyone who gave this movie a good review please don't ever write another review again.But I guess it's just me, I found this movie lackluster and by far the worst kids movie for quite a few years. Thanks for wasting my time.",3,15,28,13 July 2013
World War Z," This movie Is awesome!
","World War Z is an action packed movie that tends to get your heart racing on more than one occasion. The writers and directors want people to think it is a zombie movie, but there is not gore and decapitation like all good zombie movies should have hence it doesn't get past the M rating. There are some funny moments in the movie in which I do not think the director intended. This Movie has the features of a fantastic action movie. Yes the director puts hardly any effort into the emotional side of things but you don't seem to mind for there is just action and more action. there are only a few moment in the film where you can actually relax. I loved this movie and I would recommend it for action/thriller lovers.",7,3,8,24 June 2013
