The Rock," The best movie ever
","When this movie came to the cinema I thought: 'The Rock. What a boring title for an action movie. I don`t bother go and see this. About four years later, when I saw this movie on video, I regret awfully that I didn`t saw it at the cinema. After that first time, I can bet that I`ve seen it at least ten times. From the first second I was thrilled by the great actors, the wonderful scenes, and most of all; the music. Hans Zimmer did a great job when he put together this masterpiece of a soundtrack. And when I see Gladiator, the score always reminds me of San Francisco and Alcatraz.I just love Sean Connery. Enough said?",10,1,1,12 January 2001
