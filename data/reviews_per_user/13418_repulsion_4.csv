Requiem for a Dream," A Dreamy Trip Through the Hell of Addiction
","One of my favorite moments in cinema occurred when Cocteau's hero in Blood of the Poet desperately tries to rub off a pair of lips from the palm of one of his hands. Having rubbed the lips from the a portrait he has painted, the artist is told by the living statue in his studio that a scar like that is not that easy to remove. From there, the hero is thrust into a Kafkaesque dreamscape where he realizes that `sleeping or dreaming, the dreamer must accept his dreams.' There is such a sensibility in the new Aronofsky film, as characters seem to float between a harsh realities and dreamscapes.If Darren Aronofsky is remembered for anything in the annals of filmmaking it will be for staging the definitive `drug movie.' It is a masterwork of cinema that manages to stage the act of drug use as a cacophonous act of self-destruction where the individual will scale the ends of a their seemingly shallow existence in order to further dissociate themselves from their self-imposed, pathetic lives.Aronofsky goes for the jugular as he bombards the viewer with a dirty, lyrical pathos that is instantly reminiscent of the seemingly masochistic fashion that Paul Thomas Anderson greets his characters in the climax of both Magnolia and Boogie Nights. Take the final image of Lars Von Trier's Dancer in the Dark and stretch that for nearly two hours and you have the gut-wrenching and harrowing effect of this film.Manipulation is a word that is too easily thrown around when talking about films like this. Those who have suffered or have seen others suffer from the effects of addiction will no doubt find a very confrontational truth to this film. Aronofsky, whether personally familiar with the chaos of drug use, knows the desperation of the addict who seeks out the next fix like a vulture scavenging on a rotting corpse.Eugene O'Neill's maternal figure in `Long Days Journey Into Night' was a sad, pill-popping woman who was hopelessly stuck in the past. Her only link to her drug-free past was a wedding dress lying quietly in her closet. Ellen Burstyn is that woman. Slowly wilting away in her Brooklyn apartment, her husband in his grave and her son catering to his growing heroine addiction, Sara Goldfarb finds herself compelled by the simple pleasures provided by a TV game show that promises self-actualization to its viewers in the form of fortune-cookie wisdom. One phone call later and the promise of being on the TV show has Sara shockingly falling into a vortex of self-imposed hatred as she desperately tries to fit into the red dress she wore to her son's high school graduation.This is no dream that is being lived, but a self-imposed reality, and Aronofsky stages the descent into hell as an act of mourning. Clint Mansell, who orchestrated a phenomenal music for Aronofsky's Pi, creates some of the more dramatically effective crescendos imaginable; beautifully complimenting the journey these characters take into nothingness.The final images of the film, focusing on the winter of the characters' lives, is admittedly extreme, but only in the sense that it spares the viewer nothing in showing them the degrading lengths people will go to, and the degrading end results that welcome them, at the hands of addiction. And when teachers instruct their students as to how to master the fine art of drama, let it be known that Ellen Burstyn will be remembered for having given one of the finest and most revelatory performances to have ever graced an image of celluloid.",10,0,0,9 October 2000
American Psycho," Mary Harron one-ups Bret Easton Ellis
","Patrick Bateman, the yuppie serial killer du jour created by Bret Easton Ellis, is obsessed with all things superficial. Ellis' written world is full of super-attractive young men with secret killer ways. He wallows in his protagonist's masochistic behavior and only occasionally manages to step back and comment on his behavior on a larger scale. Patrick Bateman is intended to be the metaphor for Reaganism on the kill but somehow this message is muddled amidst the non-stop name-dropping and unending detail that Ellis gives to Bateman's ritualistic killings. Mary Harron (I Shot Andy Warhol) one-ups Ellis in just about every department with her screen adaptation. The fact that many designers did not grant Harron the permission to use their names in the film could have been a Godsend because it forces Harron to focus on the more relevant nuances of her character. Harron brilliantly establishes Bateman's attraction for all things narcissistic in a scene where he describes his daily facial rejuvenating process while standing in front of his bathroom mirror. If you combine that moment with Bateman's non-stop exercise regime and his desire to dine at the fanciest of restaurants, you have a Bateman that is concerned with nothing more than his own beautification.The infamous threesome scene that slapped the film with an NC-17 rating is a great one because it shows Bateman, played with astonishing madness by Christian Bale, completely detached from the act of sex. Much like Ellis' portrait of Bateman, he is a man more concerned with performance than with the actual act of sex. While having sex with the women he looks at himself in the mirror. He is making love to himself, enjoying his muscular body as it masochistically berates the women.Although Patrick Bateman is a completely loathsome soul, Harron appropriately adds a certain human element to her psycho killer. Even though Bateman admits over voice-over that he is devoid of any emotion there is a scene in the movie where we get a sense that he is seeking some sort of salvation from the world he has created for himself. After bringing his secretary (Chloe Sevigny) to his apartment, he has her leave after telling her that if she doesn't he might do something horrible to her.Bateman's sadistic ways are certainly a product of some twisted childhood or adult experiences but Harron does not choose to focus on this. There is a tongue-in-cheek moment where Bateman apologizes to a dinner-date for being late by saying that he is a `product of divorce' but this is about the only glimpse we get into the character's pre-killer days. It's as if Harron is flippantly teasing us with the comment, knowing that we are itching for some sort of Freudian psychoanalysis of her character. The gore is at a significantly lesser scale than one would be expected considering source material. Aside from one astonishingly executed sequence where a prostitute (Cara Seymour) flees from Patrick down some stairs, the killings in the film are handled in a comedic, albeit disturbing, way. The women in the film do not get much characterization but this is an appropriate thing when you consider that the film is shot through Bateman's eyes, a man that is little concerned with the motivations of his victims.There is a moment at the end of Psycho's wonderful finale where the characters are watching a presidential address by Reagan. They blankly comment on the program and we basically learn that their lives will continue as is. I wish there were more of these moments because so much of Psycho's substance lies in the way that these men are seen as products of the society that was created under Reagan's America. Bateman's soul is one that is consumed by greed and it seems that he has been given a second chance by film's end. Whether he will take this exit or continue this masquerade is open to interpretation and perhaps dependent on whatever political shift should sway the nation.",Null,0,0,17 December 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," An accomplished film by Ang Lee
","The story begins when a renowned swordsman named Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) travels to the palace of a peaceful king named Sir Te, whose security is maintained by his friend Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh). Mu Bai has just returned from a meditative excursion to a mountain that has left him spiritually unsound. Although his non-enlightenment was something that has left him in a state of unease, and at odds with the promise made to him by his dead master, Mu Bai still decides to renounce his famed sword, the Green Destiny, to the protective hands of Sir Te.Ang Lee quickly establishes the social order of his characters when Shu Lien meets Sir Te's daughter Jen (Zhang Ziyi), a seemingly quiet girl whose secretly rebellious nature lies at the center of the film. A mysterious figure steals the Green Destiny and Mu Bai believes that the perpetrator is Jade Fox (Cheng Pei Pei), a female martial arts legend who was responsible for the death of his mater. The three women at the heart of Crouching Tiger all represent the vastly different paths the female can choose to follow in a world dominated by the fighting male. It's a world that these three women have longed for but one so inherently uninviting to the woman that it is very easy for these women to choose the path towards evil. Jen, arguably the film's center, is caught in the middle; needing to decide whether to follow the teachings of Jade Fox or bow before the open arms of Mu Bai and Shu Lien.The Wuxia Pien, a category of the kung fu drama relying heavily on the presence of warriors with magical warriors, is something inherently melodramatic and ridden with archetypes and cliches. This is in full effect in Crouching Tiger, but Lee manages to stage the proceedings with such a gorgeous glow and pristine understanding of his characters pathos that their journeys toward self-actualization is something that is always within the realm of complete believability.Take one scene in the desert, where Jen becomes romantically linked with the bandit Lo (Chen Chang). The flashback to the much younger Jen shows her pursuing Lo across the desert in an attempt to retrieve a comb. Her pursuit of the girly item (albeit a family heirloom) is at first troubling, considering how fiercely independent she is, but her journey becomes rooted in a mutual exchange of power between herself and Lo. Her love for Lo, erotically charged in ways that makes Minghella's The English Patient look like the cheap burlesque story that it is, becomes the source of primal strength that will drive Jen throughout the duration of her life.Lee and Peter Pau, his cinematographer, stage their characters within their settings in such a way that their relationship to their environment becomes something from which the characters draw spiritual strength. Mu Bai and Jen's dance atop a forest's treetops, the film's visual centerpiece, could have been saddled with spectacle but Lee turns the choreographed bout into something much more urgent. It is a battle between a man completely at ease with his relationship to nature and a woman so driven to prove a point that she has failed to notice that her impulsiveness has not gained her the spiritual peace of mind that will make her a true master.Many have singled out Michelle Yeoh as the centerpiece of the film. One would be hard-pressed to find an actress who can express so much with so little and even though Yeoh's tragic beauty seems to hint at a legacy of pain, Lee fails in truly center Yeoh's Shu Lien within the confines of a solid and three-dimensional narrative. It's always clear that she and Mu Bai gave up on love because of the respect she still harbors for her dead lover, but there is nothing to their relationship aside from a couple of longing stares. It's subtle, but too subdued to register as much of a passionately resonating impulse as the relationship between Jen and Lo.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon belongs entirely to Zhang Ziyi, a fierce creature that teeter-totters between the inviting force of good and evil. Her journey, which ends in a glorious display of spiritual self-sacrifice, is engaging because we never know at any given point in the film whether she will fall into the welcoming arms of Mu Bai or Jade Fox. She is to Crouching Tiger what Luke Skywalker was to Star Wars, and I'm sure many will find the mythos that is so deeply-rooted in the Lee film to be reminiscent of the world that Lucas created in his 1977 space saga.The world of Crouching Tiger could very well be the world of China itself. It is a world of magic and intrigue, where men and women are bound by the ethos of honor and dignity. It is a land rich with the intricate history of all it's people, slowly enveloping its arms around the females of the land, long relegated to the role of servant and obedient wife. Many will no doubt flippantly brush Lee's film away as a mere post-feminist diatribe, catering to the Camille Paglias of the world who long for female empowerment in otherwise testosterone-laden tales. But let's not trivialize a film that is obviously grasping for something entirely more complex.Crouching Tiger isn't a film about women beating each other up for two hours. Granted, there is plenty of woman-to-woman battle sequences, and they are all ferociously fierce of behold, but the film's quieter moments suggest that this is not merely a film about female empowerment but female solidarity. One of the film's least energized scenes allows us to feel sympathy for the otherwise loathsome Jade Fox because we understand that her chosen path was one that was necessary for her to take. It was a decision that was in direct opposition to the status quo but it was her only apparent means for self-expression. Her intended revenge on one of the main characters is nothing more than a misguided, although understandable, attack on a fellow woman who used thievery to impose above her the proverbial glass ceiling that is usually constructed by the male.",Null,0,0,17 December 2000
Gladiator," Ridley Scott's lame take on a WWF bout
","The denizens of the Roman Empire were a particularly bloodthirsty lot, and apparently not that far off in mentality from our own culture. The vox populi, bored to the heavens with the multitudinous burdens inflicted on them by their government, seek escape in the mind-numbingly bland entertainment provided within the Colosseum. Gladiators fend for their lives against a series of uniquely dressed foes and beasts, all in the hope of winning their freedom. Everything about this testosterone-toned epic is meant to cater to a population who likes their filmed landscapes served to them WWF-style.Maximus (Russell Crowe) is a top army general in the army of Marcus Auerlius (Richard Harris), a dying patriarch who (in predictable fashion) unwittingly causes trouble within the family ranks by offering his throne to Maximus instead of to his son Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix). Auerlius' son is the kind of whinny, pussy-whipped boy that your audience likes to hate because the character's moral fiber makes the character so easily expendable. Commodus' temper tantrums lead to patricide and the film turns into an interminably messy three-hour affair simply centering on the standard theme of revenge.Maximus is sent to die in the woods but manages to get the upper hand and kill Commodus' henchmen. He returns to his homestead only to find his wife and son lynched from trees. Poor Maximus is denied the throne of Rome and is now being fueled to wage a one-man war against the sissy who wiped away his entire family. As Maximus works his way back to Rome, unbeknownst to the new king Commodus, our foppish king swishes around the kingdom ridiculously hitting on his sister Lucilla (Connie Nielson) and hovering inappropriately over his nephew Lucius (Spencer Treat Clark).In the first hour Ridley Scott has expertly painted his archetypal figures, forcing us to love the brave Maximus, wifeless and sonless, and hate the creepy teenager with the thirst for forbidden fruit. Maximus, once back in Rome, manages to enter a gladiator troop manned by one Proximo, the late Oliver Reed. This little group of circus freaks will provide Maximus with the proper cover through which he can maneuver himself into the hearts of Rome's people. Not only is the man driven by revenge but he is also cocky enough to believe that he has what it takes to accomplish the sort of feats no other gladiator has been able to accomplish. By his side is Juba (Djimon Hounsou), the proverbial Black voice of wisdom. If not for Will Smith's more unfortunately stereotypical role in Legend of Bagger Vance, this would have been the kind of role that would have garnered the deserved scorn of people like Spike Lee.For two hours, Scott inundates us with endless arena fireworks that would serve the acrobatics of the Rock and Hulk Hogan to a much better effect. The characterization of Crowe's character amounts to nothing more than a cocksure man, full of false bravado, whose only apparent skill is to raise his arm into the air and scream for his men to surge into battle. He is the kind of screen character who wages war against hundreds of foes within the course of a movie and manages to dispose of all of them with relative ease. He is also the kind of superhero archetype that garners the admiration of young boys like Lucius, something which causes our dear Commodus to go even further over the edge.Scott is to be admired in the end for at least not being a hypocrite, as he practices what he preaches. Since the citizens of Rome seem only to live for bloodlust, Scott manages to paint Gladiator as nothing else than that: entertainment geared for audiences whose sole interest is seeing men and tigers beat the s**t out of each other for three hours. But if this is all there was to the film then one would see little complaints from my person but Scott makes the mistake of filling his film with arty flourishes.The film opens with Maximus walking across a field, his hands slowly caressing tall blades of grass. These flashbacks, along with various cutaways to fast-moving skyscapes, amount to nothing more than pretentious attempts to add artistic credibility to an otherwise sophomoric film. Its as if he is aware of the fact that his film is devoid of any three-dimensional resonance that he tries to quickly interject soft touches of humanity into the proceedings. The end result is nothing less than visual illiteracy, ringing completely false and cowardly.When it comes to epics none come better than Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev or Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky, two masterworks from Russia's greatest directors that fully captured the three-dimensional scope of war. The bad guys in these films, unlike the one played by Phoenix in Gladiator, are the kinds of foes whose selfishly malicious journeys are never cartoonishly drawn. The landscapes created by the Russian masters were poetic and grand, full of visual and emotional urgency. Scott's film is amounts to nothing more than being beat over the head by a club for three hours.",1,48,115,17 December 2000
