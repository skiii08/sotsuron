Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat-the worst movie I ever saw!
","I just came back from the cinema,so my memories are really fresh!'Borat...' is the worst movie I ever saw and now I regret I even paid the ticket!!If I could describe it (but it's difficult since it would imply it had substance) I would say that it's a mix of xenophobia,antisemitism, obscenity and lack of respect for any human value! I wonder how is it that this movie was not banned from being seen, especially since everybody in the movie is played for a fool and the real characters are framed into participating to so-called documentaries! It is a disgrace for the film industry and an offense to everything moral and commonsensical!",1,168,334,19 November 2006
