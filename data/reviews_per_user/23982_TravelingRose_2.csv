The Perks of Being a Wallflower," One of the Best Movies of the Year
","I loved so much about this movie its hard to know where to begin. High-school students are frequently portrayed as either nasty (like those who would lock someone in a locker or strip them of their clothes so they have to walk home naked), or they're simply portrayed as so stupid you can't figure out how they ever advanced to high school. But NOT IN THIS MOVIE. This came across as real life high-school to me - a mother of two: One a high school kid; one a high-school graduate. These are young adults (not young idiots like in most high-school themed movies). They have real life events going on, and real-life feelings and reactions to them. The writing was outstanding and believable in every respect. Outstanding job by Stephen Chbosky. The acting - particularly that of the primary 2 characters was of such a calibre that I truly hope they both continue to get lots of acting roles in the future. And a special shout-out to Emma Watson who did an American accent flawlessly.Everyone I recommended the movie to thought it was excellent. Another Mom saw it with her husband, and then went back later that week with her two children.My only beef: I feel as this movie either lacked adequate promotion, or was simply snubbed at every awards show for no apparent reason. Something of an injustice for such an outstanding movie.",9,0,1,30 August 2013
The Flowers of War," Good history lesson
","Very touching, well-done film. Several very graphic/disturbing scenes, but likely necessary to capture the feel of the time. A piece of history I knew virtually nothing about, so glad to have received my education in this manner.Might have been nice to have sub-titles, though without speaking a word of Chinese or Japanese I could almost always get the essence of the many conversations that took place in other-than-English. I agree with another reviewer who commented that a romantic scene amidst all the carnage and atrocities in the movie seemed somewhat out-of-place. I think I'd have given more points if the screen-writer had seen fit to figure out a reasonable way to avoid going the obvious route in that scene. Kudos in particular to the girl (can't recall her name), who felt her father was a traitor. Outstanding performance from beginning to end!The movie is quite long and I felt it could have been shortened a bit by culling some of the war footage in the early part of the movie. As a result, it took us a bit longer to 'commit' to the movie. Overall, an excellent movie.",8,0,0,30 August 2013
