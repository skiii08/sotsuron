United 93," the concrete of history is forming before our very eyes
","what scares me more than anything else is when i can see fictional accounts of supposedly historical events being formed and solidified before my very eyes.This movie is based on pure speculation. Everybody on the plane died.. but somehow we have this extremely detailed account of what happened to make Us feel good like we 'beat' the terrorists? This movie creeps me out BIG TIME. Ranks as one of the most scary movies I've seen since the Shining, but for totally different reasons.Paul Greengrass should be ashamed for being part of such blatant propaganda. Evertyhing about this movie seems like a joke. Maybe its because i didn't buy into the Jessica Lynch or Pat Tilman stories? I don't really know, but what i do know is that many people will believe the events in this film, which deeply scares me.",1,116,282,22 April 2006
Batman Begins," most faithful to the comic of the entire film franchise
","I honestly expected to like this movie much more than i did. Part of it was the amount of time I'd been following the development of begins. I never expected the movie to actually come out...So when it did i was extremely surprised It took many liberties with the Batman origin story from the comic books, but was able to capture the feel of the the comic better than any of the previous 5 Batman pictures (including the Adam west 70's movie).semi-spoiler warning - some of the stuff below reveals specifics about the movie but stuff that in my opinion wont truly spoil anything. any ways I'm going to give some bizarre comments on aspects of the movie which other people may not find important. <ul><li>Music - One of my big worries was what will the new Batman theme sound like? Danny Elfman's batman theme for 1 &amp; 2 was some of the best music ever written IMO. The theme and music composed in a similar style was used throughout Batman: the animated series, which is by far my favorite screen adaptation of Batman thus far. The opening title music from Batman Begins was very dark and ambient, had some electronic elements but was mostly just acoustic sounding drones over slow taiko-like drums. A very drastic change from all previous batman films. Not a theme song really, but it was a good atmospheric opening to the film. Later the score reminded me of the eerie but emotional piano music from 'Unbreakable' or 'The Sixth Sense'. This was mostly played during the flashback sequences from Bruce Wayne's childhood. Some of the action oriented symphony music was good but not too memorable during Wayne's training. Later in the film when you actually see Batman fighting for the first time the music turned very cheesy Jerry Bruckhiemer-like. I'm not sure if this where Hanz Zimmer stepped in, but whoever is responsible for this atrocious cookie-cutter music should resign. Sorry for sounding so angry but when these regurgitated 'time is running out' Vin Deisal themes start i get a little pulled out of my suspension of disbelief. Other than the 10 minutes of this awful music spread out over the last 45 minutes of the movie, the soundtrack was pretty-pretty-pretty-pretty-pretty-pretty-pretty-pretty good (Larry David voice).If i had to choose I'd sadly pick the Batman Forever soundtrack over Batman Begins. </li></ul><ul><li>Scarecrow psychedelic weapon - this was definitely the best aspect of Begins for me. They portrayed the Scarecrow as a realistic and almost likable guy, aside from the fact that he caused hallucinogenic waking nightmares upon unsuspecting people. The visual effects team did such a wonderful job that i was sad we didn't see more of the Scarecrow's Datura-like gassings. </li></ul><ul><li>Batman - Christian Bale was great as Bruce Wayne, but as Batman i still think Keaton was better. The horse scary voice whisper Bale does in the close-up Batman dialog makes him seem less intimidating than even Val Kilmer. When Batman first appears on screen it is a very scary moment. Bale still does a great job (when not speaking) of making batman seem like a frightening and almost evil man in many scenes. This is what makes up for his sometimes sheepish batman character interaction. </li></ul>overall i give the movie a 7 out of 10, i felt the ending was unfulfilling, some stuff ruined the great atmosphere at times, but it is definitely a breath of fresh air in the batman movie franchise.",7,5,10,15 June 2005
