The Hangover," What happens in Vegas does not stay in Vegas unfortunately
","After seeing the movie I was so unimpressed I felt like writing an ironic review praising the fine acting and exquisite plot in this film. However, since it's currently in the IMDb top 250 and number one in the US box office, being a bit more serious seems like a better choice since I think the irony probably would be lost on most people.The Hangover is about four guys who go to Las Vegas to attend one of the guy's bachelor party. They have a wild night and wake up the next morning not being able to remember a single thing from the previous night. This setup could possibly make for a somewhat entertaining film, however they have failed on this one. Out of the running time I think I laughed about two times. It's a very excruciating thing to watch a film where even one joke falls flat, in this one which is supposed to be a comedy they turn into string combos of jokes that simply aren't funny.The humor is crude, sexist, violent, and still without going ever going over the line which is a problem. Comedies that go over the line, like Borat for example really is my cup of tea, but The Hangover never really dares to venture there. For example you are supposed to think the fat guy is funny because he is weird and stupid, although he comes off as too pathetic for it to be funny.The plot never draws you in since one does not feel anything for the main characters, they are all unlikeable in their own unique way. In movies it's important to have a logical thread going through the entire film, and not introduce too many random characters or events that are not motivated, especially not in the later half or so. In The Hangover way too many characters and situations are just randomly inserted which I suppose is meant to be goofy and hilarious, but it just comes off as bad scriptwriting.Worst of all though, and what really puts me off in The Hangover is the glorified picture of Las Vegas it produces, which unfortunately is very common in the mass media today. Las Vegas appears to be a paradise on Earth, where you come to have fun, win lots of money, and still leave with a smile on your face, no matter what happens. Because, what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. Well, let me tell you something: I've been to Las Vegas. Never in my life have I been to a more horrid place. I would never ever want to go there again. To me Las Vegas really embodies all the bad parts of the American culture. Nothing feels real there, it's all about surface and everything has this plastic, artificial feeling to it. Commerce is what it's all about there, spend money or lose it by gambling. None of this matters though, because most of the average joes watching this film will never go there, so film makers can continue to picture Las Vegas in this almost mythological way.",1,70,143,10 June 2009
Shaun of the Dead," Yawn of the Dead
","** SPOILERS **Before I start with the review I'd like to make clear that I am a huge fan of anything that has anything to do with zombie films. I see all I can get my hands on, whether they get good or bad reviews and whether I've heard anything about them or not. Shan of the Dead seemed like a cool idea for a movie, at least prior to when I saw the trailer. After seeing the trailer I thought I'd give it a chance anyway. Something not recommended to others, since that's those 99 minutes of your life that you're never going to get back.One of the main problems with this movie is the characters. For good drama you need suitable characters to move the story forward. Shaun of the Dead lacks this vital component. In many instances it's hard to tell what the screenwriter was thinking. The following characters inherit this film: The main character Shaun. He is an ugly loser with nothing going for him. He feels sorry for himself the whole film through all the way to the ending, but it's really his own fault that he is a big loser. Shaun has a friend who lives off him and Shaun's other roommate. This guy is a lazy, fat and disgusting slob with no sense of responsibility whatsoever. I forgot to mention that he deals marijuana as his only way of income. Adorable, isn't it? Shaun's second roommate has a job (!!), a sense of responsibility and seems to know what's right or wrong. Constantly throughout the short period of time that this character still survives, he is being called names behind his back by his 'friends', and he is the one who dies first.Hold up a second here. Something's wrong. The unsympathetic main characters are morons who nobody can identify with, and the only sensible person in the trio gets killed off quickly. You can't build a movie like this. If you can't identify yourself with the protagonists, you won't care what happens to this and then the movie will not draw you in. I won't bore you with descriptions the rest of the characters, but it's basically the same drill as with the ones I've already mentioned.Another problem with the film is that it's a bit schizophrenic in the sense that it doesn't know what kind of movie it wants to be. It certainly is no romantic comedy, because 1. Let's face it: How romantic are zombies, really? and 2. It's a failed attempt at comedy since very few jokes actually are funny. Maybe the last one is because it's a British sort of humor that I don't 'get'. Anyway, the up until the last 20 minutes, the movie tries to be a comedy, then however it gets 100 percent serious and turns into some sort of splatter-horror-drama. This film is not a good film, and it's one of the worst zombie films I've seen and I've seen some pretty bad ones.",1,49,129,22 March 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," An utmost entertaining modern disaster movie with a very important message
","The Day After Tomorrow tells the story about a select few who has to endure and fight for their lives to survive a new ice age brought on by global warming. What this film has going for it the most are the special effects which are absolutely mind-blowing a majority of the time, not to mention how stunningly believable they are.The film also offers a good story about courage and the importance of working together to overcome obstacles, told with the genre conventions of a good disaster movie. It feels like a good change that for once the main characters are everyday people (a homeless man, young students etc), while the people with the supposed power like the president and the Dick Cheney-lookalike vice president are little more than fools. The forces of the weather are a little bit too much even for the president of the United States, who can do nothing real when faced with the reality that he has ultimately helped to create.The greatest achievement of this film is however Roland Emmerich's way of putting the very important message of the environmental issue, into this high-concept film without doing it too obvious. Still, perhaps it's a bit too much in your face since I believe this is the main reason why people don't like this film. The average moviegoer doesn't want to be told that their lovely cars that they drive around in every day can cause a big disaster. People don't want to be told to be aware of the environment in any way, and just go about their business consuming the way they are used to.My only gripes with the film: 1. Jake Gyllenhaal doesn't look even one tiny bit like a 17-year old. 2. The wolves look fake. 3. The three Scottish persons saying 'For England!'.",8,5,8,16 August 2007
Battleship Potemkin," I don't get it (possible spoilers)
","Ok, I didn't expect much, but I'm having problems with the 'greatness' of this movie. I think I'll take the liberty of not jumping on to the bandwagon of proclaiming that everyone should see this movie and so forth. Any normal person today who don't know what you 'should' think about this movie, would probably find it quite boring and strange at times.Thing is I'm not comfortable with the way the 'rebels' in this movie value lives. Reminds me of the death sentence mentality in the US and other countries today. The sailors kill several officers on the ship, but since they are bad guys that is perfectly OK. When one of the sailors however get killed, the horror. Out of nowhere a couple million of Russians come along and cry their eyeballs out for some sailor's death, a person they've never seen before! It lacks logic, and as I said I think you can go on fine without seeing this movie. Don't get me wrong I still think the movie's OK, but certainly not the greatest of all time.",6,22,36,26 October 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Simply amazing
","I've been going to a lot of movies the last six months, and I can tell for sure that Episode 2 is unlike anything else you can see at a movie theater right now. The special effects are even better than those in Episode 1 and light years ahead of those in LotR: FotR. And so is the movie as a whole also, it ranks over all other Star Wars movies in my book except Star Wars: Episode 4 - ANH which is hard to beat. I like the acting including Hayden Christensen and the script is much better than when Lucas wrote it himself. Of course the movie is not without flaws, but very close to it. I don't know what's up with the negative comments here, feels like an insult. They're probably jealous or something. If you like Science Fiction or movies in general, let the force guide you to the nearest movie theater and see it now! I've only seen it once, but just have to see it many more times! My score: 10/10.",6,1,2,18 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Don't let the hype catch you **spoilers**
","I've just been at a showing of this film today of its premier, and yes I've read the books. I do enjoy them quite a bit, however most of the things that are good with the book are somehow lost in this film. Given you can, and have to I guess, take away stuff from the book to be able to make a film out of it, this one is a good example on how you should not do that.The film starts off with a big battle. Which looks very CG. But oh well, that's how it starts. It wasn't yesterday I read it, but I can't remember the book having any of this stuff in the beginning. Do they include it just to have an excuse for an action sequence or for the exposition? If it is because of the exposition, I think they could've easily let this one and other ones out and instead tried to develop the characters. Remember this movie Star Wars? In the beginning of the first part they talk about the senate, the rebellion, the empire... You haven't got a clue what the hell these are, but the movie still works! I guess this could be because I've read the books, but they just keep on talking about all the things over and over until the seats in the theater knows exactly what it is too. The ring is indestructible. Ok, I get it. Gandalf throws it in the fire but it stays intact. Uh-huh. Gimli hits it with his axe, but its the axe that is destroyed, not the ring. I know it, already!In the film we get to see Saruman and Gandalf and Saruman's place a lot (Mordor?). In the first book Saruman and how he makes the Orcs and everything are hardly even mentioned. I think they should have let it be like that. More for your imagination to make up, you know. The story is about the fellowship of the ring right? I don't care about Saruman, I don't need him until the second book. I sense a bit of Star Wars influence here, this with showing bits of what the empire is doing all the time. In SW it works, this movie would've done fine without it. Another thing is the part where they cut down all the trees, they don't explain to the poor people who haven't read the books what is so important about that... Could be fun for them to know maybe. Or don't care about showing it, please.Also the character development is lacking. Sam, Merry and Pippin are like smaller and less extreme versions of Jar-Jar Binks. Their only purpose seem to be so they can get captured by the Orcs so a few of the fellowship guys have to go after them. They join the mission just because they are stupid and happen to show up in right in time, or something like that. Not like in the book out of friendship with Frodo.Also I think they heavily mess up the place where Gandalf fights the balrog. Again, I could be wrong, but in the book didn't Gandalf practically sacrifice himself for the rest of the fellowship? He chose to stay behind and fight it knowing he would have to go down with it too. In this movie he seems to be able to defeat the balrog and still go on, but right when he's about to go the balrog gets him with his whip and drags him along. Changes Gandalf's personality and heroism very much in my humble opinion.I do like the fight scenes however, especially the fight in the dwarf cave and the one in the end. The shaky camera is nothing but a nuisance, but other than that they are great. Gollum is very well done aswell, almost exactly the way I imagined him. Looking forward to seeing more of him in part two and three. The whole film on the other part could've been done much better. I doubt that without the popularity of the books, people wouldn't have liked it as much as they claim they do now. I was a lot younger when I saw it, but I remember enjoying the animated version from 1978 more than this one which really isn't much more than OK. Oh, and I can also mention its too long. Many of the scenes seem to drag on for very long.",4,2,3,19 December 2001
American Beauty," One of the best and most touching movies I've seen in a long time
","I live in Sweden, a country which has none of the movie viewing culture of the US. I know this cause I've been there and checked it out. This means people rarely go to the movies here, and if they do they usually start to leave the theater a bit before the end credits start. When I went to see this movie, when it ended the whole theater was dead quiet. For a moment everyone just sat there (and this was not because they had fallen asleep for you sarcastic persons out there). I think it describes very well the quality of this film.Sure, it has cliches, but it's a comedy! A black such but nevertheless, the cliches are clearly there deliberately. I found American Beauty very touching, describing in a realistic way the dark and strange world we live in today. Acting and music score is great too. Oscar for best picture couldn't been given more rightfully than to this movie. Walking out from viewing I looked at life from another perspective. I really need to watch it again so I can feel that one more time.",10,0,0,28 October 2001
Spirited Away," Horrendous
","Many of the negative comments so far have already said what I want to say. That is, sure, the animation and the backgrounds are wonderful. But that almost makes the film even worse, it feels like a lost chance at making a very good film with both great animation *and* a good script. I found this film severely lacking in that last department. I can not understand why it is ranked so high on the top 250 (at the time of writing this around spot 40). None of the characters' actions seem motivated and they are very badly developed. It seems like the person responsible for the 'story' here just throw a lot of 'cute' and weird characters in and made the whole thing an obvious reference to Alice in Wonderland and thought the rest would solve itself. It didn't. The end result is that you just don't care. The pace is very slow. A lot of things may happen but the film doesn't draw you in. I think that many of the problems with the film 'Princess Mononoke' was repeated in this anime. I thought this was so bad it was provocative, I wanted to leave before I had seen half of it, but I sat in the middle of the row so I endured the rest and the movie never got any better. My rating: 1/10.",1,22,100,12 February 2004
Good Will Hunting," Not So Good Will Hunting
","Good Will Hunting is a story about a genius who for various reasons has not been able to take advantage of this and, when we are introduced to him in the film, is working as a cleaner at a university. This guy's name is Will Hunting and he is played by Matt Damon. He solves a ridiculously difficult maths problem and is found by a maths teacher at the school played by Stellan Skarsgård. And it goes from there.I think that if I had watched this movie when it was released, prior to Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's careers, I would've been able to enjoy it much more. Since they have both written the script and play leading roles in the film it's hard not to judge it with this in mind. Neither Damon nor Affleck appear to be people who would pick fights, rather they appear to be people who would avoid something like that to a large extent in order to not danger their good looks. They are very much cast against type, but that ties in with the fact that most likely one of the main reasons they wrote this script was to shape roles for themselves to launch their respective careers. I would have no problem with this, if this was a good movie, which unfortunately, it is not. Minnie Driver also is not good looking enough for her part to be believable.Gus Van Sant is one of my favorite directors, although I find his later more 'experimental' movies - like Elephant, Paranoid Park and Psycho - much more rewarding as opposed to his earlier work which is more conventional and main stream. The main problem with this film though lies within the script, so I suppose he did what he could with what he was given in this case. For a movie to be entertaining, gripping and interesting, you need a conflict. I fail to find such a thing in this motion picture, and I did look for it the entire running time.It is a mystery as to what you are supposed to feel for the main character in this film. It is hard to feel pity for him since he himself is the main obstacle to getting what he wants, success, money, respect and so on. Many people try to help him but he fights them with all he has got. He has the personality of a spoiled brat (funny enough that in the picture this is the very opposite of what he is supposed to be: A poor bastard who has had to fight his way to survive). It is also hard to identify with him since a very small percentage of the viewers of this film are geniuses who has not had to lift a finger to get where they are.It's easier to understand the problems of this movie if you compare it to a film about a similar subject which actually works. In Rain Man the main character truly is pitiful. His fate is a sad one since he is gifted but his disability has rendered him unable to interact normally with other people. The film is gripping since the viewer feels for the main character and his brother trying so desperately to reach him and find a place for him in this world.In a word you can sum up this film as plastic or fake: It's a pseudo-intellectual movie of the worst sort, it tries to go deep but only scratches the surface. A positive: Robin Williams does a great job with his role, he always seems to do better when he is given a serious part to play. When I saw Matt Damon in this film all I could think of was his involuntary part in Team America: World Police. 'MATT DAMON!'. Even though he was played by a doll in that film, his part seemed more real than in Good Will Hunting.",1,33,69,7 February 2009
Coyote Ugly," God Awful Mess
","I consider myself a feminist, and I suppose that is why much in this movie really just doesn't cut it with me at all. Of course in this drivel we are given the portrayal of feminism and females in general that people seem to think is good nowadays. Real women dance in bars and exposes as much bare skin as possible and splash water over themselves, and at the same time they talk about this independence complete BS. At one point of the movie we are told why the bar is named Coyote Ugly - entrance 'funny' joke that isn't a fraction cliche by now - 'because X was taken'. Whee. Actually contrary to most people I guess, I didn't find one of the female cast attractive. You know this thing food. They should try it. They all just look anorectic to me. Which leads to another problem, the total absence of acting in this movie. Nobody can act, especially not John Goodman, it's as if he tried to act really bad but making it turn out even worse in the process. This film, aimed at teen girls primarily, also sends out many messages that are very unhealthy in my humble opinion. Alcohol is nothing bad, 'looking good' is another word for being an anorectic and yes of course you will become an actor or a singer or whatever if only you work hard enough. I gave it a 2 out of 10, but honestly I can't remember why I didn't give it 1, I guess I must've slipped.",2,2,5,17 January 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Why is this movie in the top 250?
","I had very low expectations on this movie, and I was still largely disappointment. That, folks, is not good. Neither is this movie.I'll start with the good stuff. There are actually some nice moments in the beginning of the film. Of course one of the worst things is in the beginning too, but I'm getting to that. Some of the scenes, like when Christian first meets the 'Spectacular, spectacular'-gang is rather fun. The scene where they explain the play to the duke is nice too. But that's about it.Can someone explain to me, what it is causing the editor to not being able to show more than 1/100th of a second at a time of footage in most of the movie. WHY does he necessarily have to switch through all the characters all the time? Let me watch one character speak, and then the other, THANK YOU! A lot of cuts works in action sequences in action movies. It helps the action there. In perfectly ORDINARY talk scenes, they have to have cut to different directions ALL THE TIME. What is it supposed to create? Is it supposed to be 'cool'? Personally, it just gives me headache and takes away my concentration on the plot.When you write a script to a movie, there are things you leave out for the audience so there will be a reason to watch to the end of the film. This, movie, I must remind myself that that's what it is, reveals the ending right in the beginning! I suppose you could consider this a spoiler, but since it so clearly pointed out even before the real narrative starts, I can't see why I shouldn't tell it. In comparison, consider how good The Usual Suspects or Citizen Kane would be if one found out how it was going to end in the beginning.From the point where Zidler or whatever his name is, signs the contract, you know exactly how the movie is going to proceed. This is somewhere in the middle. It drags on, scene after scene. I sat there in the end, wishing it would end in a somewhat original or at least surprising way. But no, I get nothing. Except fear.Fear that it is movies like this which people are going to promote and see in the future. Movies with no plot, horrible script, very weird selection which characters to develop, appalling editing and these anachronistic songs all the time. Ok, so they're clearly modern songs, but people singing about smog around the shift of the century? No thanks.Granted a big part of the musical is the music, they still need a story to capture one's interest. You can't make a movie with special effects, we all know this, but likewise you can't make a good musical without a somewhat intriguing plot. The Nightmare Before Christmas, Sound of Music, even South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut are fine examples of great musicals with good stories.I give this movie a 4/10 just because there were some good parts (albeit very few), Nicole Kidman is good looking and Ewan McGregor was in it. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go think about the hours of my life which I have lost forever. Which I could have spent on more important things like poking out that stuff which collects in your belly button. If you haven't seen this movie, but plan to, I advice you to turn on MTV for two hours. It will have basically the same effect, except most of the time you will see commercials which may be at least remotely original.",4,0,1,11 December 2001
Clash of the Titans," Haters gonna hate
","One of my very earliest memories of being blown away and scared to death by a movie was when I was a kid and saw Jason and the Argonauts on TV. With a child's eyes there was no doubt to me that it was some sort of documentary, and the fight with the skeletons stayed with me for a long time. Ever since then I have been a fan of Greek mythology and the huge monsters that inherit the stories. So you can imagine I was really excited for this one, despite all the negative reviews. I went in to the movie expecting little more than simply an entertaining popcorn movie, and that was exactly what I got.The makers of this remake have changed the story around a lot, the original also deviated from the original myth about Perseus, but this goes even further away. The result is not perfect, part of the film's biggest problems is the bad lines and all the exposition that is needed because of the changes made to the original story. The story of the 2010 version seems to be made to be some sort of allegory to the war on terrorism, with Perseus in a marine haircut going out to the desert to find evil (Osama Bin Ladin), and then return to ward of the terrorist threat made by Hades and his horrific Kraken. The original Clash of the Titans is far from a perfect movie even though it's more true to the original myth, and one of the good things about the changes made is that it allows for more action scenes. Which should be the main reason why you go and see a film like this one.I've not done any academic research into the subject, but I have the firm conviction that movie ratings and whether you like or dislike a movie depends 95 percent on your expectations. If you go into a movie like this and expect another Godfather, of course you are going to be let down. If you go into this movie and expect a light hearted action film, you are likely to be satisfied because that's exactly what this is and it doesn't promise anything else. The special effects are really good and the action scenes rival those in Avatar. The 3D effects are only a gimmick in CotT and they look really bad (especially the actor's faces in closeups, they look like they are inflated balloons or something), but it's not enough to ruin the film. Any fans of action films should be able to enjoy this one as long as you go into it with an open mind and realistic expectations.",8,3,6,20 April 2010
Avatar," Cameron delivers again
","***Spoilers ahead*** I was having a pretty lousy day when I entered the cinema yesterday. And despite James Cameron being one of my favorite directors and Aliens being one of my absolute favorite movies of all time, I was not sure about Avatar. The criticism has been about the story so naturally I was worried that this one would be all fluff but no substance. After having seen the film I can gladly report that is not the case, rather I would say the story and its themes is one of the stronger points about the movie, not considering the fantastic special effects.It seems unnecessary to recap the story since I'm sure you've all heard it a thousand times by now. To point out a few things about it that no one seems to have talked about I would think is a better thing. All of James Cameron's movies are in some way about dreams. He frequently uses his personal dreams as inspiration for his films, perhaps most famously the idea for the Terminator which he got from a fever dream. This motif is used to its fullest extent in Avatar, where Jake Sully's journeys with his avatar body are like dreams from which he has to wake up. It all takes a fascinating meta-level when you think about our mediated world today and how many things we do just to get away from our real lives: Playing video games, drinking alcohol and of course - going to the movies. The very final scene of the movie is a clear nod to this notion. One could view Jake Sully's very physical disability as an analogy to any sort of disability or disadvantage that would keep a person from doing what they want. In the dream world that Jake flees to he has everything he ever wanted; Adventure, a beautiful potential love interest, 'people' or rather Na'vi who care about him and so on. In the grey, cold and lifeless world he comes from, he is just 'meat on wheels'; A nobody.The movie actually leaves you with a bitter sweet feeling. Nobody's existence on this planet can be as wonderful as living on Pandora, much like Jake Sully you don't want to 'wake up', but after 166 minutes you have no choice. Thank God you have the option of seeing the film again which I will do for sure, wallet-raping ticket prices for the 3D version or not. It certainly is worth it.People think the characters are thin and the story is clichéd and predictable, but I could not agree less on all points. To me it seems like a conspiracy, an attempt to bring the film down. I've seen a lot of movies in my days but most of the time I could not predict what was going to happen. The critics seem to be mistaking narrative means of telling a story with clichés. More than anything, the use of familiar themes and shapes for the animals and so on, is a sign of good storytelling by letting the audience recognize the familiar and thereby relate to the film on another level.In the above tirade about Avatar's story I have not said much about the special effects in the film which of course are outstanding, but they are very seldom there as anything more than a means to an end, just like in any good science fiction film. The same goes for the 3D, they are never just a gimmick where they point something straight into your face, it's just there to add to the whole experience. Avatar is far from a perfect movie, you could easily cut about 30 minutes out of the film and still tell the same story, and some moments are cringe-worthy. But as an experience, which to me is what movies ultimately are about, there is simply nothing that compares to Avatar.",10,11,18,19 December 2009
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Big disappointment...
","I rented this movie because I've heard people say it was good, it's high on the top 250 here and stuff. But I just don't get what is so great about it. Sure, the acting is fabulous, especially Jack Nicholson, but you need more than that to make a great movie. Nothing really happens, there are flaws in the story, and are you supposed to think that head nurse is evil? I never thought so, she was just doing her job or what? Darth Vader, there's your baddie, or Emperor Palpatine these guys are mean.I gotta admit I laughed a few times, and this is not a bad movie. But masterpiece? Star Wars and Jaws are two 70's movies that are better than this one. I give it a 6/10.",6,12,28,7 November 2001
The Green Mile," I expected a whole lot more
","I don't know, I rented this movie after hearing a lot of people claiming it was so touching and all(including Britney Spears herself in an interview, damn you Britney!). They should've labeled this movie 'Based on something Stephen King has written' so you know that prior to actually watching it. I'm not saying Mr. King is bad, it's just that it's very hard to make a touching movie out of a plot that is depending on something that is so hard to believe in. It's just too unrealistic with all the healing stuff, when the movie was over I just thought 'Ok... so?'. I gave this movie a 6/10, if you want good Stephen King, watch the Langoljeers (that what it's called?). If you want a touching movie on the subject, watch Dead man walking. And if you just want a damn good touching movie, go see American Beauty.",6,8,19,28 October 2001
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Awesome, but probably a film mostly for the fans
","I went to opening night of this film and saw it in a theater packed full of more than 700 screaming fans. Revenge of the Sith is a very good action and adventure film, although the story is a bit convoluted since it has to tie up a lot of knots left over from the two first films. Because of this, I'm afraid this one is very much a film for Star Wars fans, alternatively fans of Science-Fiction in general, not so much a blockbuster that 'anyone' can enjoy, like for instance the Lord of the Rings-films. This is not necessarily a bad thing though, George Lucas has clearly made this one with the fans in mind and as a fan I couldn't be more happy. I can remember six years ago when Episode I was released, and I was convinced that it would beat Titanic as the highest grossing film ever at the box office. Today I'm not that naive, and I can even say that if you didn't like Episodes I-II, then stay away from this film because it has more in common with those films than it differs from them. There's just a small portion of the running time in which the film starts to feel and look like the original trilogy (which, by the way, is awesome and sent shivers down my spine when it finally happens).The film is packed to the brim with eye candy, cool villains, creatures and space battles which are really nice and well-made with computer generated special effects, but the action parts are for the most time relatively very innocent and something children probably enjoy more than someone my age and older (I'm 22 years old). Not to worry though, the script is really good and the movie is naturally more serious and darker than Episode I and II, so there's a lot for adults to appreciate here as well. Lucas ties up most of the knots very well, and if you know anything about Star Wars you know exactly what will happen, what's interesting is to find out *how* it happens.Story-wise, the movie reminds me of a classical Greek drama, or perhaps being told a great fairy tale that you've heard before but still is told in such a unique way that it captivates you entirely. The dialogue I have to admit is still a problem, it's stiff and there are a lot of silly unnecessary jokes that aren't funny, but the acting and mise-en-scene in general make up for this more than enough. Ian McDiarmid takes his role extremely seriously and shines in his performance, easily his best in any Star Wars-film as he has gotten to know his character throughout the films. Other minor gripes with the film is that the composing of real-life actor's heads and their CG bodies don't always look convincing (on the whole, the CG is flawless though, just take a look at those close-ups of Yoda's face), and the way some of the story elements's knots are tied in the end have a bit of a deus-ex machina-feel to them.I can't imagine any true fan of Star Wars to be disappointed by this film. When push comes to shove and he has to, Lucas really delivers with a masterful achievement like this one. Revenge of the Sith is one of the best Star Wars-films out there, and no question the very best of the new trilogy. I will see multiple more times at the theater and I can't wait for the TV-series. Long live Star Wars, and May the force be with you!",10,1,5,19 May 2005
The Matrix," I fell asleep the second time I saw this movie
","I really can't see what everyone thinks is so great about this movie, I think it is wildly over-rated. The special effects? Fore example the bullet scene: like another user said before me, it's slow-motion, and it's been around for a while! The bullets don't even look realistic at all. The other effects aren't that impressive especially not the robot guys that cut themselves into the ship in the end, they look awkwardly badly done, you can easily tell that they are CG. That Episode I lost all its Oscars to this movie is a big joke and it was sure as hell the last time I went up 3 in the morning (I live in Sweden, another time zone) just to see that lot of hypocrisy.I'm a big fan of (most) science-fiction movies and series, especially Star Wars but the plot in this one has too many obvious loose ends. ****possible spoilers ahead**** Humans to warm the earth? Yeah right umm, what about building a large battery and some kind of warmth generator instead? Or using less complicated minds like cows instead of humans then they wouldn't have to worry about that stupid matrix thing.The movie is also cluttered with clichés like 'There is no spoon'. Blah I got it that the matrix wasn't real the *first time* Morpheus *said* that to Neo. And also the ending is just plain stupid, sure love saves the day. That always works.",1,14,35,23 February 2001
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The greatness of this movie cannot be described in text
","Ever since I first saw this movie (you guessed it, as a kid), I've been a huge fan of it and the series. I own it in four different versions, and I have stopped counting how many times I've seen it. To give any description which comes anywhere close to the truth on how completely fantastic it is, you would have to make another movie about it, or draw a painting or something. The story, the characters, the music, the special effects, everything is perfect. I could go on, but I think you get the point. And for you who say the Matrix is better, you are way off. They simply cannot be mentioned in the same sentence. Period.To sum it up, the best movie of all time, way ahead of its time, there will never be any better. This movie changed my life and made me get into movies. If you haven't seen this film you should not count as a human being. 10/10.",10,0,0,2 October 2001
