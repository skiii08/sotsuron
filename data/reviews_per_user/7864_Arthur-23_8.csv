Mission: Impossible III," This film should have been called 'Malias'...
","From the creators of the TV show 'Alias,' we now have 'Malias'... or the male version of Jennifer Garner's famous spy role. For anyone not familiar with ABC's Alias, Mission Impossible III is a great movie. But for anyone who knows Alias' various tricks and plot twists might be less impressed. On the one hand, Tom Cruise does a fine job. He played his character well. The action sequences, especially the ones in Shanghai, were very effective, but, in making M:I-3, director and co-writer J.J. Abrams seems to have drawn heavily on two of his prior TV shows---Felicity and Alias---for inspiration, both in terms of style (the party scene near the beginning seemed inspired by Felicity) and plot twists and action scenes inspired by Alias. Of course, there are cast overlaps among all three with Felicity's Keri Russell and Felicity/Alias's Greg Grunberg playing all-too-brief roles in M:I-3. However, it's unfortunate that Keri could not have played a more developed character in the film. Nonetheless, these earlier influences were obvious from the very first scene, which used a typical Alias forward/backward plot device that's been used in virtually every season of Alias. The scene starts in the future then we spend three quarters of the movie backtracking to discover how we got to that first scene. Then we see the manipulation. And bang, bang the spy saves the world again. Just like Alias this is true of M:I-3. Considering the action scenes alone, however, they really were impressive, particularly those of Tom Cruise running through the streets of Shanghai and leaping off of buildings. Camera angles were perfect. But viewing Mission Impossible III makes one believe that Alias could make an effective transition from television to the silver screen. 'Alias, The Movie' could make for an even better film since its plots are more complex than M:I-3. But with Tom Cruise as the male version of the central spy, his performance as 'Malias' delivers the goods. For that this movie deserves 7/10 with an extra point for anyone unfamiliar with the classic TV show on which this movie seems to be based.... not 'Mission Impossible' but 'Alias.'",Null,1,2,6 May 2006
As Good as It Gets," It could get a lot better than this!
","I cannot figure out what all of the fuss was about. How this mediocre film won so many Oscars is one of the many Hollywood mysteries of the '90s. The script was poorly written, the characters not well developed, and the overall tone just hard to tolerate. Nicholson's  obvious psychiatric problems should have been the focus of treatment. Why a seemingly smart woman such as the character portrayed by Helen Hunt wouldn't more vigorously suggest this is beyond me. Treatment would at least have shortened this unfunny 'comedic' film. Don't see this film unless you want to be bored... If this is as good as it gets, no more movies should be made. It could have gotten A LOT better than this if only the script were better.",Null,0,1,28 April 2001
Stripes," A fun comedic adventure!
","Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, and John Candy. Need I say more? A truly hilarious film that remains funny after repeated viewings. Murray's trademark sarcasm is right on target throughout the movie. Harold Ramis' English class is as funny as it is profane! This is a comedy with a heart. One without the gutter humor of contemporary juvenile comedies. Well worth the time to see.",Null,0,0,9 July 2000
Fargo," Well-acted but totally overrated
","Let me see if I understand this. Fargo won the Academy Award for best screenplay written directly for the screen? Astounding. Another nominee that year, Jerry Maguire, was more deserving (not to mention a better film overall). Yes, Frances McDormand and William H. Macy acted well. But the story was empty and transparent, the motivation questionable, and the outcome not entirely resolved. Why did William Macy's character need cash in the first place and what was so important that he would consider extorting his father-in-law's money at his wife's expense? What about Macy's character's son? What happened to him? And what about the money buried in the snow? Didn't anyone check his father-in-law's bank accounts to see that a million dollars was missing not merely 80 grand? What about his lawyer? Did I miss something here?? And what was up with that old high school chum of Frances McDormand's character, Mike Yanagita, and his contrived story? What was the point of this? And why would her artist husband (who only seems to eat rather than work or paint) not be a bit concerned that his seven-month-pregnant wife went to investigate cold-blooded murders? I definitely must have missed a lot of things here... At least her point that money isn't worth the violence perpetrated was on the mark... and this was better than 'A Simple Plan' (1998), but otherwise there's not much left to say about this film. Well, if you're easily amused by overly-exaggerated Scandinavian / Minnesotan / North Dakotan accents, then see this film. If you enjoy dark humor with sudden bursts of homicidal violence then see this film... Otherwise, don't be misled by the Academy's misguided choice in 1996. Overall, a darned-tootin'  7/10.",Null,3,8,2 December 2001
The Game," Is it really just a game?
","When watching this film, one is mesmerized by the potential improbabilities of the plot. The timing, the events, the vast conspiracy... or is it a conspiracy? We just don't know. There are hints along the way that take viewers from one side of the spectrum to the other. Just when you think you've figured it out, another plot twist is thrown at you. 'The Game' is an intriguing cinematic experience and Michael Douglas plays his role very well. Sean Penn was also convincing. At it's essence, 'The Game' is a modern, urban, corporate America version of 'It's a Wonderful Life,' but the difference is that there are no kind angels guiding Michael Douglas' character around... at least not in an obvious way. He's ostensibly isolated and possibly on his own, taking us along down a confusing and difficult journey. If you see this movie, and you should, don't do so unless you stick with it through the final 10 minutes, because therein lies the explanation for it all. Without those final minutes, you haven't seen this film. This is not 'Sixth Sense' but much, much better. An intriguing 9/10.",Null,0,1,24 November 2001
Mission: Impossible II," Terrific action flick !
","In contrast to the almost incomprehensible Mission Impossible (I), this sequel is interesting, comprehensible, filled with action, and has considerable style. Much credit goes to director John Woo whose use of Australian visuals and stylized fight sequences were great to see. While I wouldn't go as far as to say he is the James Bond of the 21st century, Tom Cruise delivers his best acting performance to date. Well worth viewing, and if a third installment can deliver another fast-paced action-filled ride like M:I-II, I look forward to it !",Null,1,1,8 July 2000
Shall We Dance," Sometimes a person's just gotta dance!
","What does a man who has achieved the proverbial American dream do when he realizes he is bored with his life? A middle-aged man who feels too embarrassed by his riches to admit his feelings of apathy to anyone. Not his coworkers, not his friends, and certainly not his wife. A man whose conscience tells him that revealing his innermost thoughts would be tantamount to admitting personal failure and give rise to a sense of unworthiness for the good life he has achieved despite the happiness he hasn't found or retained. Richard Gere is faced by this dilemma in Shall We Dance, a remake of the popular 1996 Japanese film of the same name. Gere plays Chicago lawyer John Clark who seems to have it all---good health, white-collar occupation, house in the suburbs, attractive wife (played by Susan Sarandon) and well-adjusted children---but realizes that all he has is a life marked by a routine broken only by the daily train commute to and from work. His stable, secure and contented home life, which would be the envy of most, simply lacks spirit, excitement and, for Mr. Clark, joy. In any other film looking for easy solutions, Gere would have to become an embezzler or have an affair. But not in this entertaining and warm-hearted film. Gere's character transcends his humdrum existence through ballroom dancing. Sounds simple, but it's not. He's got to learn, which means taking lessons. Jennifer Lopez is his inspiration, but he also meets other interesting people, emerging with a renewed lease on life as a result of his musical quest. There are a few bumps along the way, but the movie's tone is nothing less than nice and pleasant. It entertains without insulting its audience.Jennifer Lopez is also very good in a minor role, and proves she still has her moves as the assistant dance instructor who helps Gere get his rhythm. Stanley Tucci is hilarious as the straight-laced lawyer with a secret alter ego he unleashes on the dance floor every night. Much of this is in the original Japanese film, including tap dancing under the desk and dancing while waiting for a train. But this American remake is definitely worth seeing to experience the elation that Gere experiences on screen.While the original Japanese film had more drama, pathos, and suspense, this version achieves its cinematic vision by a comfortable comedic touch that is sure to please. This is a nice film with nothing to offend. It's bright and charming entertainment that also gives viewers pause for thought. Shall We Dance deserves an 8/10.",Null,0,0,15 October 2004
The Godfather," A great, but flawed, morality tale
","Since its release in 1972, The Godfather has become firmly embedded in popular culture due in no small part to Marlon Brando's mannerisms, exaggerated jaw line, and the film's rhythmic dialogue. It has therefore rightly earned its position as a classic in American cinematic history. However, its fame may have had an unfortunate and unintended side effect of glorifying organized (as opposed to disorganized, indiscriminate) crime by raising it to an almost 'noble profession' for some. Despite the sociological impact, the film's music, cinematography, and authentic period cars and clothes were very effective. While the film has a clear and unmistakable pace at which dialogue is delivered and scenes are developed, which succeeds in holding the viewer's attention, the pace is undeniably slow and the film is long. Yet the characters are interesting and the film will hold your interest.At its core, this film is about an Italian-American family trying to modify its business practices to survive in an uncertain and rapidly evolving world but in the process continues its tradition of 'violence as honor,' while aligning itself to religious principles it does not share for in the 'Godfather's world' another religion in practiced, a religion which revolves around money, power, and honor of family and turf. Make no mistake, this is a good film and Francis Ford Coppola deserves credit for his direction and screenwriting, but in my view it does not earn the 10/10 that thousands of IMDb voters have given it for the following reason: When the plot is boiled down to its essential elements, it's just a story about one highly dysfunctional family confronted by a changing society, the demise of an old world, and relentless problems with neighbors and neighborhoods. This is a common theme used in many different ways in innumerable films before and after The Godfather's release, so this aspect does not differentiate The Godfather from many other films in Mafioso and other dramatic genres.
For me, a fundamental problem existed with the subplots of honor and family. While there is a strong 'honor code' which everyone in 'the family' is compelled to hold to great esteem, i.e. respect for the family, its traditions, its business interests, and the expectation and necessity of showing the utmost respect for the head of the family (which is certainly not uncommon among Aboriginal, Semitic and East and Southeast Asian traditions), when it comes right down to it this is just a thin veneer to cover all of the nasty deeds the family is involved in, e.g. corruption, racketeering, gambling, intimidation, and retaliatory murders to even the score. Except for drugs and prostitution, most crimes are well within the inventory of the family business, despite early protestations to the contrary by Michael Corleone (played by a young, almost unrecognizable Al Pacino) whose personality is transformed over the course of the film's trials and tribulations only to have him emerge as a sadistic aspiring re-builder of the Corleone empire.Without giving away the plot, an aspect of the film appeared obvious in its intent. One of the key reasons for Don Vito Corleone's 45-film-minutes of slumber (the result of being comatose after an attempt on his life) was to serve as a device at mid-point to summarize early plot developments courtesy of 'Consigliore' Robert Duvall for both Brando's and the audience's benefit. This seemed intentional to underscore the significant impact of events in the first half of the family's saga to those of the rest of the film.
The Godfather is an interesting and deservedly controversial morality tale about one immigrant family's traditions and its continuous power struggles, but because of plot and thematic elements mentioned above, I give it an 8/10, which isn't bad at all.",Null,1,3,6 July 2002
