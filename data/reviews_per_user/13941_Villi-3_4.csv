Scarface," One of the most over-rated films ever?
","Scarface is a strange film, which due to its strong cast and popular subject matter (gangsters) has become hailed by many as a great masterpiece.Sorry, but it's not very good. After a promising introduction, when it looks as though this may be a serious drama, things look up. The early motel shoot out is claustrophobic and well handled, and the infamous 'Chainsaw & Bathtub Scene' is very scary indeed. However, it goes steadily down from there, and as this is over 2 1/2 hours long (on the UK cut), it goes down a long way, to a ridiculous climax which throws all of the tense realism of the earlier scene out the window. Pacino's performance is good as usual, although all he really does is look stoned/shout 'FOCK DIS! FOCK DAT! FOCK YOU, FOCKER!'etc., and supporting performances are good. The film is also very downbeat, so after 2 1/2 hours, you feel really depressed (or bored) watching it. I recommend you watch the film, but stop as soon as you start to feel it drag, instead of waiting for it to get better, as I did. IT DOESN'T.You might like it. But approach with caution:- it's not a classic.",6,1,4,9 March 2001
Alien 3," Absolutely bloody terrible
","This film has to be the worst of the series. Whereas Alien 4 would be hilarious if it wasn't so tragic, this is terrible in every way. Alien had only one, super-intelligent, creature. Aliens successfully altered the formula by having an army of gormless critters. This film has one alien, but unfortunately it's just as gormless. I won't give away plot points, but it does some stupid things. The characters are all bald in this film, making it more difficult to tell them apart. This fact, along with the fact that they are all rapists, murderers etc. does little to generate sympathy. The only character who we care about, played by Dance, is dropped from the story almost as soon as he appears. Finally, the overall tone of the film is VERY depressing and draining. Fincher (who should be shot for this film, however good Seven and Fight Club were) has tried to describe this film as upbeat. He must have some major emotional issues as you cannot describe a film in which 95% of the cast dies as upbeat.
**********PLOT SPOILERS BELOW!!!!****************I can only think that this film was Fincher's deliberate attempt to murder a fantastic franchise. He kills Ripley, for a start, and in killing Hicks he destroys the possible replacement. I can see how the death of Hicks could have worked- going down in the blaze of glory against the aliens- but the helpless and ultimately pathetic death he suffers before the film even starts is wholly unacceptable. Killing Newt is just cruel.I don't know what else to say about this travesty of a film. It has destroyed one of my favourite series of films. No wonder Alien 4 was so bad when it had to follow this crap.I would give it 0/10 if I could, but I can't, so 1 it is.",3,677,783,21 May 2000
Alien: Resurrection," Please, no more.
","This film is the forth in the Alien series, and it comes very close to being the worst. While Alien and Aliens were both excellent (everyone has their preference, personally, I prefer Aliens), Alien 3 was a complete mess and that is barely improved upon in this sequel.The director tries to turn this into an arty film, and while that is no bad thing, it does not gel with the gruesome subject matter. The cast is mediocre except for Weaver, Winona Ryder standing out in particular as she seems to have no purpose but to expand the male fan-base. A number of scenes do not work, and many are just plain laughable. One scene reminds us once again that man meddling with nature is BAD, as Ripley destroys a lab of aborted clones. The characters hardly generate sympathy with their one-liners and constant complaining.And just wait until you see the Newborn, a new species of alien. What should have been a horrific blend of man and creature has been realised as a monster more likely to have you laughing into your popcorn than cowering in terror. In the original film, a terrifying monster design (by H.R.Giger) was occasionally let down by dodgy special effects. Here, there is no excuse for bad SFX (although they are often ropey), it is just that the design is terrible.There is, however, one good scene. An underwater sequence which leaves you breathless quickly gets your hopes up again about the film. 'Will it be like this all the way from now?' you hope, but no. The mediocrity of before quickly returns.",Null,0,0,19 May 2000
Evil Dead II," Scary and funny.
","This, although it is a horror film, is one of the funniest films I have seen. Wild camera angles, bizarre creatures, and minimalist but funny and memorable dialogue make this one of the best horror films I have seen. Forget its video nasty reputation (mostly caused by its more horror oriented predecessor) if you are squeamish, for the gore that there is is mostly for splatter comedy. However, despite the humour in the film, there is a sense of brooding menace and plenty of heart-stopping moments to please any horror fan. Also, it has on of the best endings ever filmed.",10,1,1,23 February 2000
