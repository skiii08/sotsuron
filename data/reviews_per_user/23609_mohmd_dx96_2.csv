Iron Man 3," Over-hyped.Had higher expectations.
","I believe I was not the only one hoping for something epic.I won't say I'm very disappointed,but this could have been at least close to what people(or comic fans)expected.Very few lines that would make you laugh,not the Stark we know,maybe some will say that the movie was meant to be serious.If so,then why use a very cheap plot with The Mandarin? I know some people who liked what was done with The Mandarin,saying that they were fooled by the trailer and they liked it.Actually that may be considered the 'smart' part in the movie,but I wasn't totally fond of it. I liked 'Ty Simpkins' as the side-kick kid,he did pretty well and gave taste to the story.The battle near the end was good,not clich√© and well executed.One problem was that stuff that fans liked were misused:The Iron Patriot was accepted as Rhody,but had no significant role,the suit at the end of the trailer was thought to be a Hulkbuster(which it wasn't)was seen once in the movie I believe,and not to mention again The Mandarin. All the actors were great,just the story wasn't helping. I actually loved the post-credit scene more than many in-film scenes. I don't think it's' a waste of money,but if you liked 'The Amazing Spider -Man',this was slightly better.",7,1,3,4 May 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A Weak Movie
","On first viewing, four years ago, when all the thirst for Star Wars was there, this was a very good movie. Then fast forward to one night before The Rise of Skywalker and a few minutes after rewatching The Last Jedi... The Force Awakens is a weak, safe, nostalgia-driven movie. It has zero heart and zero risk. It's a play that's good enough to keep the audience around for what was to come, but on its own, it's just... okay.",6,3,6,18 December 2019
