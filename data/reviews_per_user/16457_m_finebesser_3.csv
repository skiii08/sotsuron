The Legend of Bagger Vance," Beautiful but boring
","To anyone who has seen the Horse Whisperer or A River Runs Through It or The Milagro Beanfield War, all I need to say is that Robert Redford directed this movie.  Virtually, all of Redford's films seem to have this in common: a) they have magnificent performances; b) they have three or more unforgettable sequences; and c) they are exquisitely photographed; and d) they are dominated by long stretches of background settings that are about as exciting as watching grass grow.",4,0,1,17 August 2001
Bridget Jones's Diary," Offbeat fun
","Renee Zellweger's accent is uneven, but the rest of this enjoyable what's-a-gal-to-do comedy is spot on.  Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are both excellent in the two major male roles.  The situations are mostly believable.  The 'Greek Chorus' of Bridget's friends is perfection itself, and Bridget's mum and dad are ideally portrayed.  Sit back and enjoy.",8,0,0,3 August 2001
Gone with the Wind," Long on hype, short on believable performances
","I know this comment will be viewed as sacrilege from the vast majority of movie lovers.  This is just one woman's opinion.  I find Gone With The Wind to be one of the greatest pageants ever filmed.  The opening scene at Twelve Trees is a dressmaker's dream.  The breadth and depth of the cast is amazing. This is clearly a big-budget epic.  There are many people who love grand-scale epics for, well, the sheer grandiosity of it.  This is what makes movies such an individual experience.  I am not one of those people.I love believable characters, thoughtful premises, clever plot twists, terrific acting, and witty dialogue.  Gone With The Wind has all of these things, but only a sampling of them.  Clark Gable is tremendous as Rhett Butler and Ona Munson is unforgettable as Belle Watling.  But (here comes more heresy) Vivian Leigh's over-the-top frenetic performance of Scarlet O'Hara is bad acting at its zenith.  She is never anything but a cartoon. And, she is supposed to carry the film.  Even worse is an insipid Leslie Howard as Ashley Wilkes.  Hattie McDaniel is great as Mammy (It is a disgrace to realize that it was 62 more years before a Black woman could win another Oscar, also for Supporting Actress).  But Thomas Mitchell is present in body only as Scarlet's father.  The rest of the all-star cast fares much better in their bit parts.  This is one movie that has never lived up to its legend for me.",4,5,20,17 August 2001
