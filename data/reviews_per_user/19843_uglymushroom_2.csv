Your Name.," Beautiful film.
","I personally loved this film, though I admit I may need to watch it a second time to fully grasp everything I saw. The story is just so mind-boggling! You may end up recognizing some familiar concepts, but they are presented in a way that is not too 'cliche' and without shoving romance in your face the entire time. Overall, Your Name is an unforgettable experience. It left me totally mystified. 10/10",10,2,4,18 February 2017
Mother!," mother!
","'mother!' is the darkest film Aronofsky has ever released. I went to see this film with hardly a clue of what it was about. What I watched unfold in front of me was beyond anything I have ever seen on film. The acting is fantastic, particularly Michelle Pfieffer as the Woman, and Jennifer Lawrence who gives what I believe to be her bravest performance to date as Mother. Keep in mind that the film is an allegory, so expect a hefty amount of symbolism throughout. I don't want to give anything away, but just know that the climax for this film is completely insane.You will either appreciate this film for what it is, or you'll find it pretentious. Either way, one thing is certain: You have never seen a film like 'mother!'.",10,5,13,20 September 2017
