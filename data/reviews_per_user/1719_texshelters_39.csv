The Lobster," The Lobster is a disjointed film that runs too long and doesn't know how and when to end.
","The Lobster left me CrabbyIf you had to be turned into an animal, what would it be? That is the set up for the film, 'The Lobster.' People go to 'The Hotel' from 'The City' because of a tragic romantic loss and are forced to choose the animal they will become if they don't find a life partner in forty-five days. It is unclear whether people are forced to go there or they choose to go because of their emotional loss. One bit of dialogue could have solved this problem, such as, 'I had to come here because my wife left me; Why are you here?' would have solved this conundrum. That is just one of several parts of the story that are unclear. A film that is not completely explained is one thing; a film that is inexplicable is a let down. Like the Lynch film 'Inland Empire', 'The Lobster' ends too soon but goes too long and is more confusing than mysterious. The Hotel is a combination of the worst dating scenes know to humanity. Some people are there seeking a relationship, others are happily hooked up while others try to mess up those romantic bonds using rumor, lies, unfortunate truths and the maiming of others. Some critics say this film is in a dystopian future. It seems more like a parallel present, with the film being an allegory for relationships and how we treat each other. It is an incredibly interesting story until near the end. The setting changes, a new plot point emerges and while interesting, the end doesn't honor the quality of the rest of the film. An interesting ending might have saved the film and made it fabulous, but it got lazy. It seems the director and writer didn't know how to end it, so they left it hanging. I don't need everything resolved, but setting us up and not resolving anything is bad film making. Imagine 'The Usual Suspects' ending with the scene of Verbal Kint sitting in a chair in Detective Kujan's office, then a fade to black. Imagine 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' ending on a shot of the three gun men facing off in the graveyard, then fade to black. Nope, the directors and writers of those films knew they needed and ending, wrote one, filmed it, and then distributed it. 'The Lobster' fails to end and runs too long. It is a major disappointment, for it had such a great beginning and middle sections. Not even the good acting, great cinematography and good editing could save the film from dying. The critics love this vagueness, as if being confusing was artsy, just like critics once called a blank canvas fine art. It's all up to interpretation, you see, so go forth and interpret. Well, then why make a film at all? At Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 90% rating by the critics. I wonder if half of them fell asleep near the ending or went to the bathroom and missed the vast emptiness of its mindless conclusion? That must be it. Who else can explain such ratings?Rating: Rent it. I have written myself into it giving it a low rating. It disappoints so completely at the end that it doesn't deserve more.

Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runner 2049 doesn't Completely Disappoint
","Blade Runner 2049: It wasn't the terrible replicant I expectedBlade Runner 2049 is too slow for some, too confusing for others, and too repetitive for many. But few argue that it doesn't look fantastic! BR 49 packs in a lot into one film; it could have been two installments. My film-mates said it could have been a series, and that West World covered a lot of the same themes, but more in depth. I, however, don't want to watch a full season of a series to just get mildly interested, i.e. West World, Ozark, Game of Thrones, at the end of the season. And of the three, I will watch GoT one day. It's not going anywhere. Strangely, some of the same people that sat through hours of characters yapping at each other while posing in costume thought BR 49 was slow. I like that BR 49 got right into the plot and was full of philosophical ideas about what makes one human and if replicants can evolve and are a separate species. Until you see the film, you won't know exactly what I mean. For my money, two films would have been better to fully develop the complex story and characters. A series would have been milking a dry cash cow. Profitable, sure, but entertaining? Not for me. The major premise that the film poses is that replicants are designed to be a slave work force for humans. We see that in the trailer. One problem is that in many ways, the human body and shape makes terrible analogues for workers. Look at a factory producing cars. The arms are not imitations of a human arm, just levers that can grab and place parts where needed. And, the arms have none of the rest of the useless parts humans have: torso, heart, lungs, legs, head. The other major problem that drives the plot is how to produce more replicants, faster. For what, we aren't sure, so I couldn't spoil that plot if I wanted to. They explain next to nothing about how replicants are produced in 2049, which could have been added in part one of a two part series, a duology. The 'evil' Tyrell corporation is gone, but replicants abound, newer versions. Also, there are holograms, very real holograms. And a fantastic, trippy ménage à trois scene worth the price of admission. Moreover, there is more AI in BR 49 than at a sci fi comic book convention. While BR 2049 put too much in one film, there are things I am happy they left out. There wasn't a huge battle for the survival of the planet at the end. There wasn't a huge shoot out where our hero 'K' kills eight-hundred of the enemy bare-handed or Decker is rejuvenated and kills nine- hundred replicants or... You get the point. There wasn't a sappy ending nor a happy ending. It ended in a thoughtful, somewhat predicable, manner. The music was excellent, but there was too much of it and it was often too loud. Yes, you can have too much of a good thing. The acting was mostly flat, though the human emoting wasn't horrible. The one dynamic combat replicant was the best character in the film. She has a nice set of action scenes. Did I say how fantastic the film looked?Another problem is that the film was way too depopulated. Some of the film occurs in urban Los Angeles, but the people are missing. However, there are enough buildings for millions of beings, both human and replicant. Was it too hard to find extras to dress up in futuristic fashion and mill about? Next time, call me. Rating: Matinée See it on the big screen to get the full effect of the visuals.

It," If you're 13 or under, IT is a great summer ending film.
","I saw IT. I saw IT, and for the review I thought of Abbott and Costello: Abbott: What movie did you see? Costello: I saw IT. A: What? C: IT. A: What movie? C: IT. A: So you saw a movie? C: Yes, I saw IT.I wish I had been thinking more along the lines of 'What the hell was that!?' or 'GD, I'm not seeing that again!' or 'Man, that scene in the house, freaky!'But sadly, no. It just wasn't that scary, nor was it that creepy. Nor was it funny. It was a film with some good acting by kids, some decent make up, some okay effects and not much else. Years from now I won't be talking about this film like I have after seeing Psycho, The Exorcist, Split, Get Out, Alien or other classic horror films. For creeps, see the Japanese psychological thriller 'Creepy' or the Dutch film 'Borgman.' The film has too many clichés. What's with the scary teeth? For me, scary teeth became a cliché after watching Alien. Couldn't we have strangling ears or a deadly projectile shooting nose instead? And why the damsel in distress? That trope is so tired, even Disney has dropped it in their latest animated films. Other than the one girl, there was the chubby kid, the Jewish kid, the total nerd, the asthmatic and the normal kid, who was cute, but had one defect of sorts. Hey, at least the one black kid doesn't die. That's not to say it wasn't mildly entertaining. It was. And the visuals were fantastic while the music didn't suck. Instead of spending more verbiage on a forgettable film, I will cut to the chase.Rating: Matinée. If you like horror films and hate clowns, it's worth a look. Otherwise, rent any of the above films or see The Amazing Wonder Ape World of Mexican Mutants instead.Peace, Tex Shelters",6,4,10,14 September 2017
Detroit," The Historical Context Surrounding the 12th Street Riots is set Aside for the Brutality of the Moment in 'Detroit.'
","(Mild Spoilers)The Historical Context Surrounding the 12th Street Riots is set Aside for the Brutality of the Moment in 'Detroit.''Detroit' could have been a powerful allegory for police violence against African Americans using 1967 Detroit as a real life example of how police abuse minorities to protect white privilege. Instead, 'Detroit' is an over-indulgent orgy of violence that barely addresses the historical context in which the riots arose. The precipitating event for the Detroit riots of 1967 was the violent police raid on an unlicensed bar. The film reenacts this raid and shows the police overreacting and abusing the black revelers. The violence escalates and riots ensue. This is true to accounts of the time, however, the focus on that one event gives short shrift to the years of abuse blacks faced at the hands of a 97% majority white police department in a city that was 40% black in 1967. By not giving enough historical context to police abuses and degradation of the black populations, the film works in a vacuum where a few police go rogue and the blacks should have just cooperated more. In fact, it was a whole system dominated by whites that allowed this abuse to occur by participating in, encouraging or ignoring the abuse.The deeper, long-term causes of the riots barely appear in the film. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, 'The deeper causes of the riot were high levels of frustration, resentment, and anger that had been created among African Americans by unemployment and underemployment, persistent and extreme poverty, racism and racial segregation, police brutality, and lack of economic and educational opportunities.'There was a brief mention of the white flight and the loss of industry in Detroit at the beginning of the film, but nothing about unemployment, a history of racism by the police, or racial segregation. The plot doesn't stand scrutiny. There was a storyline about a gun, and the police who assumed that they were fired upon. The police used suspicion of violence coming from the Algiers based on flimsy information as an excuse to enter the hotel in Detroit and abuse its occupants. When those detainees were questioned by the racist police officers, none of them came forward with information about the gun that would have exonerated them. Their silence was illogical in the extreme, and the script makes no attempt to explain why they didn't mention the gun. The nine black men (two who were later killed) and two white women who were detained could have also laid the blame on a man that had been earlier shot and was dead. Why they didn't do that is another mystery. Is this true to history? I found no information supporting this account of events. What the film does discuss at the beginning is the Great Migration to the north of African American to Detroit after WWI. However, not enough emphasis was put on how that demographic change lead to an economic downturn of the city due to the money moving to the suburbs and the loss of jobs to other regions of the country. 'Detroit' uses historical footage and a cinéma vérité style reenactments. The mixture works seamlessly throughout the film. Too bad the writing didn't create a more coherent picture of the time period. Statistics of unemployment, arrests of African Americans, a rising black prison population, would have helped create the setting in which the riots occurred. The film fails to show how the riots were a watershed moment in the history of Detroit, how everything afterward became worse economically for the city and where that left the city today. Near the end of the film, 'Detroit' goes from civil rights drama to procedural drama and completely loses its way. Certainly, presenting what happened to the three white officers charged with murder was worthwhile, but that could have been done in a paragraph as an epilogue. The film was way too long. Some of the elements distracted from the story of the collapse of a modern American city and harm it caused the inhabitants and some of it was played out too long after the point was made. The detention scene in the Algiers Hotel could have been half the length once the point was made about police brutality and racism. I wouldn't call it 'torture porn' as other critics have, I would call it bad storytelling. Moreover, the court scene at the end could have been cut entirely.Rating: Rental There is some great acting in the film. Too bad the directing and writing don't support the performances to make a film worthy of the theme.",3,66,120,13 August 2017
Wind River," Wind River Misses the Mark but Tries real Hard
","Wind River: Misses the Mark but Tries real HardWhen Wind River doesn't try to be more than a nice mystery featuring clashing white and Native cultures, grief and meditations while staring at wide open spaces, it works. When it turns into a hyper tense drama of shock and violence, it plays as false. There is a rape scene that was unnecessary and drawn out in the film. It did nothing to add to the mystery or the plot of the film. In fact, it ruined was little mystery the story had. It was a reveal that was unnecessary. Then there is the unrealistic shoot out. It is highly unlikely it would have happen at all, except perhaps for one hot headed character. If they had limited the action to him, the plot would have made more sense. However unrealistic this gunfight was, it was well filmed. Was Jeremy Renner's character, Cory Lambert, a white savior in Wind River? Partially. He wasn't a white knight in the classic sense. He didn't save the day, he didn't rescue all the people, but he did save some. The character, a white hunter from Fish and Wildlife, is not out of place in Wyoming. However, it could have easily been a Native American actor and all the hemming and hawing about belonging on the reservation as a white guy would have been avoided. Renner does a good job with the material, regardless. And Elizabeth Olsen does a fine job as Agent Banner from Las Vegas. There is one scene where she is reminiscent of Agent Starling from 'Silence of the Lambs', but the characters are different. Starling presented a preppy image, Agent Banner is more earthly and less cerebral. And the cases are different. Some critics call 'Wind River' slow paced. That's only true if you expected the pacing of Fast and Furious or Super hero film. The pacing matched the setting and plot and some people will find it slow. Others call the sound track dismal. It was quiet and minimalist. I guess they wanted an overwrought John Williams or Hans Zimmer sound track. The music works well for the film, except the times I heard the chanted words. The vocals distracted from the viewing. There are many out of character actions by characters in the film. The actions by Lambert at the end of the film didn't make sense. Why did he go to save some people and make sure they were okay and not check on some of his closest friends? Why would private security draw on the police and Marshalls when they could have just asked for a warrant? The film looks good and has some decent acting, but the plot doesn't hold enough mystery and that was spoiled in the end of the second act by an unnecessary, some might call exploitative, flashback. Rating: Matinée It wasn't the worst rural, Native lands cop drama I've seen, but it had many problems. Peace, Tex",6,3,8,1 September 2017
Spotlight," 'Spotlight' highlights an important issue in a film I wish I could have liked more.
","'Spotlight' Cast a Shadow on the Catholic ChurchWith an all-star cast and a compelling story, 'Spotlight' delivers a blandly straightforward telling of the priest sex-abuse scandal and cover-up through the investigative story featured in the Boston Globe in the early 2000s. The city of Boston was torn apart by the scandal that had lasted for decades, and according the film, many people worked to shield the Church from the consequences of the scandal. Without the cover-up, the scandal would not have lasted so long. However well done and easy to follow the story was, it was predictable. Few revelations were made for me. Certainly, it is an important story to tell, and I am glad I saw the film. However, none of the characters lived up to the power of story itself and the actors adding little to its telling. This may be the case of too much story, too little screen time. The film attempted in a couple of cases to make the suffering of the survivors real, but it played like an episode of 'Law and Order: Special Victims Unit' and not like a feature film. It was too small for such a lofty topic. In the film, they often mentioned that people died, but it seemed unreal. Examples of that were need to bring it home. The film covered too much time without making the connections for the audience. I really want to like this film more, but it fails as cinema in too many ways. It would have made a better Lifetime Channel Drama as it was written. Rating: Matinée'Spotlight' is good but not great. After a while, Mark Ruffalo's (playing lead reporter Mike Rezendez) pained expression wears thin. Does he have any other look? Not much in this film. Stanley Tucci puts in a good turn as a lawyer working with the survivors, but the rest of the cast is pedestrian. Perhaps it was the writing, but the film and characters didn't greatly impact me despite the best intentions of the filmmakers and the tragedy of the true story.

Black Mass," Black Mass is a decent film, but it could have been great.
","Black Mass: A Near Miss'Black Mass' is another is a line of crime dramas set in Boston. The film will inevitable be compared to 'The Departed.' And it falls short in the comparison. The acting is top rate, and Depp is much better, not as hammy, than the comic portrait of a crime boss by Nicholson in 'The Departed.' Depp is genuinely threatening in the film and the make-up job given him in the film adds to the fright. 'Black Mass' has the look of a 70s television show, and that works in its favor. In fact, the overall look of the film is exquisite. That, and the acting, are the two best things in the film. However, the movie is both too much and not enough. 'Black Mass' tries to cover too much and thus it lacks focus. This is where 'The Departed' succeeds. While 'The Departed' has many layers and character, it has a focus: the Southie, Billy. 'Black Mass' doesn't have a main theme, a main character, a main protagonist or antagonist. There are a bunch of characters in tense situations with some irony and symbolism. However, in the end, there is nothing to hold onto, no lessons, no emotions, love or hate, for any characters. As I was watching, both my film buddy and I thought the same thing: Scorsese could have made this story work with his writing and directing. We also thought that in an era of long- form television that it could have made a great 10-20 episode show. Then it could have gone into depth about the childhood relationships between crime boss Bulger, his FBI friend Connolly and Whitey's brother, State Senator Billy Bulger. As miniseries, it could have more deeply explored the racial tensions between the Irish and Italians with the African Americans stuck in the middle. It could have taken a deeper look into Boston politics and corruption, police corruption, and more. The miniseries could have also gone further into the Irish American funding of the IRA. As it was, it touched on each of those issues in an unsatisfactory fashion. If the film had taken a deeper look into any ONE of those themes, it would have made for a better movie. Rating: MatinéeFor the great look and outstanding acting, I suggest you see it on the big screen. Otherwise, wait for the miniseries. Hey, a man can dream.

Doctor Strange," Dr. Strange is visually stunning with great acting. It is also void of spirit and lacks coherence.
","Dr. Strange: Be the Empty VesselDr. Strange, the newest Marvel superhero to hit the large screen is fabulous to look at. The acting is high quality, especially Tilda Swinton, and it's a departure from the standard shoot 'em up entertainment of the Avengers and other Marvel films. That said, it's a vacuous, trite, self- important piece, much like the character of Dr. Strange himself. It's not overly sentimental; I will give it that. But its fantastical plot leaves the audience cold. If I had seen this film ten years ago, it would have been fabulous. Today, it bores me with its mysticism. And despite the attempt by the writers to get us to buy into the world through the character of 'The Ancient One,' I'm not buying. Mads Mikkelsen is great as the villain Kaecilius, but still, I don't care. There are no fast and easy romances in the film, and that's another plus. However, I found no love for any of the characters. Cumberbatch embodies the character of Dr. Strange well, even his smarminess, which is annoying at times. And he looks just like what I imagine Dr. Strange would. His 'cape of levitation' skirts the edge of being a mascot akin to R2D2. I think they held back on the cuteness, and that was a good choice. However, Wong, played by Benedict Wong, is too much of a stereotype of the stoic Asian man. That WAS annoying. Chiwetel Ejiofor was excellent as Mordo, even with some of the understandably silly mystic lines. Swinton's ability to make the mystic talk credible was worth the price of entry. In all, it's a decent origin story with a haphazard structure and chaotic action scenes. Rating: MatinéeThe film looks great and has great acting. The mysticism and actual story were a great excuse for entertaining action. However, for all the talk of 'spirit' in the film, the movie contains little. Peace, Tex Shelters",6,2,6,10 November 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Three Billboards is Nasty and Vindictive and Only Funny to Those that Enjoy Cruelty
","Does having a daughter brutally murdered give you carte blanche to be rude and vicious to others? That is the question I walked away with after seeing Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. The set up is clever, but the delivery is clumsy. And Frances McDormand, who I will always love for Fargo, has one gear in this film: pissed off. Even her grief is pissed off. Some variety in her expressions would have helped. During the film, Mildred (McDormand) lights things and people on fire, she punches people, she insults everyone, and we are supposed to laugh it off or at least forgive her since her daughter was horribly killed. Unfortunately for the writer and director of this film, the world doesn't work that way. The action in the film was forced and lacked credulity. Peter Dinklage's character is sympathetic in ways that the protagonist, Mildred, never is. He's charming in his own shy, bumbling way. And Mildred is just an asshole to him. Mildred's son looks confused and two dimensional. I thought McDormand was standing next to a cardboard cut out of him during some scenes. Woody Harrelson as Police Chief Willoughby is incompetent throughout, though the acting is not terrible. Willoughby has failed to find the killer of Mildred's daughter. Then he fails to prosecute Mildred and Police Officer Dixon for clearly breaking the law. It is not plausible. I will give Sam Rockwell props for a job mostly well done for playing the racist, ignorant sexist and making him multidimensional. Praise the film for being a look at a mother's grief, but don't cheer when she nearly kills someone and treats everyone poorly throughout the film. Rating: Rent it. There is nothing about the film, its music, its look, its staging, to recommend it for the big screen. Peace,

American Hustle," American Hustle: 5 parts style,1 part substance, a chigger of period music, dirty with an expected twist
","American Hustle: 5 parts style,1 part substance, a chigger of period music, dirty with an expected twistAmerican Hustle attempts to be a David Mamet script filmed by Martin Scorsese. It's a nice try, but it doesn't live up to the challenge. Sure, there are a couple of memorable lines, but the timing is off. Sure, there is some great period music, but it is at times awkward and plays because 'we need a song here' and not because it fits. Sure, the costumes are great. They are also great costumes in San Francisco's Castro on Halloween. Sure, the characters are whack, but we don't care about them. You don't have to care about the characters in a movie, but if you don't care about them, they have to be interesting. The characters in American Hustle are neither empathetic nor fascinating. They are retread characters from an old seventies television cop show like Baretta or Kojak. While that's not bad, it's not enough for a major Hollywood film to sustain it. The movie starts at a climatic scene at the end of the second act and cut back to the beginning of the story, not unlike Good Fellas. However, unlike Good Fellas, there's no payoff, so to speak, at the end. The beginning is confusing and it lacks back story and development. The film is at once overly complex and predictably simple.Sure, this movie will get its share of nominations for acting and Danny Elfman's sound track (a bright spot), but it's just not that soulful, ground breaking or hard hitting. Nor is it that entertaining. Rating: Rent it. It's not terrible, and the costumes are fun. However, unless you need to see wide lapels, bad comb-overs, caked on eye-shadow and long lashes larger then life, see it at home on the cheap. Better yet, rent Good Fellas, Casino, Heist or Glengarry Glen Ross to see what you, and the film makers of American Hustle, are missing. Peace,Tex Shelters",6,21,40,23 December 2013
Rush," 'Rush' mini-review
","'Rush' mini-review'Rush' is a compelling look into a relationship between two formula-one drivers, Austrian Niki Lauda and Britain James Hunt. At first blush, 'Rush' appears to be like any other sports movie, this time about car racing. However, it's also about perseverance and about what's important in life beyond the race track. Anthony Dod Mantle's (28 Days Later, Slum Dog Millionaire) cinematography is top notch. During the movie, we see the cars from every angle, inside and out. The audience feels like they are part of the race. I will go on record right now giving Mantle the Oscar for best cinematography. Nearly as spectacular is the sound in the film. We feel and hear the roar of the formula one cars without loosing a word of dialog. The complicated blend of multiple engines, pit crews speaking, fan reactions and other ambient noises as well as the sound track makes this a challenging mix. The sound mixing is also Oscar worthy as is perennial nominee Han Zimmer's sound track. Unlike some movie composers, most notably John Williams, Zimmer can go full bore, but he knows when to pull back and let the scenes play out in near silence. Poster boy Chris Hemsworth portrays playboy racer James Hunt like a pro, but it is Daniel Bruhl as the serious, workman-like Niki Lauda that truly shines in a more challenging roll. Director Ron Howard, along with Peter Morgan's script, help us care about the flawed main characters. That is no simple accomplishment. The ending of the movie is bitter sweet as the real-life drivers play out their roles, the playboy and the technician, to the end. Rating: Pay Full Price Peace, Tex Shelters",8,2,3,1 October 2013
Nightcrawler," Direct, creepy, surreal, and entertaining. Nighcrawler leaves us with more questions than answers.
","Jake Gyllenhaal is only as good as his material. In Nightcrawler he is excellent. His character, Louis Bloom, is like the accidents he films; he shocks us, but we can't turn away. Los Angeles is the perfect backdrop for the soulless art of the freelance news stringer. They are ambulance chasers with cameras; they scavenge off the body of human suffering. They look for the worst, most sensational, tragedies and sell pain to the highest bidder at the local news stations. Direct and writer Dan Gilroy lets the story speak for itself. There are moments of camera theatrics that match the drama of the story, but the only camera work we notice is that of Bloom and his competitors. Bloom films the gutter and goes into the gutter to get his stories, sometimes seeding the gutter to have get a scoop. Bloom does whatever it takes and has at best a twisted sense of morality. Like the ignominious photographers that let famine victims starve to not interfere with the story and to get their award winning photo, Bloom will do what it takes to have the best footage to sell. The relationships Bloom creates lack a real quality. In a surreal film such as Nightcrawler, that is a plus. In fact, functional relationships is the last thing we expect from Bloom. Renee Russo as the late-night news director Nina Romina is twisted and charming like Bloom. Nina puts on the trappings of social normality even if her work is morally questionable as well. Bloom's 'employee' is cowed into work due to his desperate conditions. For all of Bloom's lack of news experience, he knows how to play people and take advantage of their vulnerabilities. He's a charming sociopath much like large hedge-fund managers on Wall Street. Rating: Pay Full PriceThe movie is direct, creepy, anxiety producing and entertaining. It has all the elements of a good horror movie in a drama. It's a critique of the media and news, and it highlights our individual isolation as Taxi Driver did for us nearly 40 years ago. Most of all, Nightcrawler entertains while making the audience very uncomfortable. It leaves us with more questions than answers without preaching to us. Peace, Tex Shelters",8,1,5,2 November 2014
The Revenant," The Revenant: Beautiful and Vacuous
","'The Revenant' is the Angry Super Model of the Oscar SeasonThe Oscar for best cinematography goes to Emmanuel Lubezki for 'The Revenant.' 'The Revenant' is the best looking film I have seen in many years. The depth of the shots is overwhelming; the mountains and the snow in the film are amazing to look at. Unfortunately, the plot and characters don't live up to the look of 'The Revenant.' The film is vacuous and lacks substance, much like a china doll. DiCaprio is good as Hugh Glass, but like the best player on a team that doesn't win a championship doesn't deserve an MVP award, DiCaprio doesn't deserve a best Oscar nod for his performance in 'The Revenant.' The other characters are flat and underdeveloped, and the acting is crushed under the beauty of the photography. Certainly, John Fitzgerald played by Tom Hardy has his moments, but he doesn't bring the character up to the level of pure hatred. For a revenge film, you need someone like Bill McKinney who played Captain Terrell in 'The Outlaw Josey Wales.' Now that was a character you love to hate. Fitzgerald didn't have enough of a past for us to fully appreciate how despicable he is. Thus, the revenge tale is not charged enough. Besides, Fitzgerald had a point when he told the Captain that he didn't trust Glass as a guide since Glass had failed to detect the Ree surround the trappers early in the film. While Hugh Glass is a man of few words; his son Hawk is practically mute. There are decent flashbacks that demonstrate their relationship, but what of the son in the present? There is little to go on. And the role of the Captain might as well have been left out of the film. The actions the Captain takes are heroic, and at the same time, incredibly stupid.There is little tension in the film other than the violence of some of the moments. There are no revelations of Glass's tracking acumen, no feeling of impeding doom felt by the evil Fitzgerald who thinks Glass is dead, no surprises in the chase and nothing revealed that is a surprise at all. All that is left is the beauty of nature and the inevitable cruelty of humanity. None of that is surprising. Rating: MatinéeSee it for the scenery, but don't expect to be surprised by the action or enthralled with the characters. Peace, Tex Shelters",6,4,8,18 January 2016
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," MIRN is a tedious but passable action film if you don't need plot consistency
","Mission Impossible: Action packed swiss cheese.Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation (MIRN) is action packed, mildly entertaining and pointless. The title is misleading. There is no 'Rogue Nation'; it's mainly one villain who is not badass enough to be a threat. Sure, he has henchmen, but nothing like Odd Job or Jaws. And the villain in no way matches the psychopathological heights of Silva (Javier Bardem) in Bond's Skyfall or the series of homicidal CIA section chiefs and handlers in the Bourne films. The script is focused on action and not character. And certainly the writing is not too concerned with plot holes and inconsistencies. There is the requisite number of gadgets in the film, but when the gadgets would minimize the danger, somehow, there are none available. This is the risk in being gadget happy; they become a crutch and a substitute for character's abilities and the audience wonder why you just don't have a gadget for all situations. One thing the Bond films have done recently is minimized the gadgets and they always told you in the beginning of the films what they had on hand so you weren't left wondering later whey Bond didn't just pull one out on call. Cruise passes as an action hero but not as an actor. He brings the film down, and the script doesn't help. The airplane action scene in the trailer seen countless times is interesting, but it doesn't compare to climbing the outside of the building in Dubai in the previous MI film. Seeing it in the trailer over and over drained the scene of its surprise and it became passé. 'Oh, this scene again ho hum.'The plot is full of holes and makes little sense. Yes, it's action, but it's still a film and should hold together as a coherent piece. Mission Impossible is based on a TV show, and thus has little direction. Bond and Bourne films are based on books, thus giving them more depth. The film create a flimsy world where we constantly see the man behind the curtain, and it isn't attached to the real world. There is no semblance that Hunt is connected to the real world at all, or that his actions will save anyone but himself. Most of us want our heroes to be rebels who fight for something bigger than themselves. Hunt has no sense of irony here, no awareness that he is part of the machine he rages against. The camera is too stagnant during the action scenes as if close ups or pans would destroy the shots. Certainly, there was a trend of hyper-editing in action films for awhile. However, editing is a way to make films intimate, get us closer to the characters, help us see the action from their point of view. The choices of camera angles and editing were mundane and uninteresting. The acting was pedestrian and the writers and director underused Renner, the best actor in the film. Pegg was adequate, and this isn't his best genre. Ferguson plays an MI6 agent who is not just a pretty face like so many other female cops and agents who appear they couldn't beat up a six-year-old, let alone a villain. She pulls of the physicality and acquits herself well, better than Cruise. Sean Harris plays the 'dangerous' Solomon Lane, super villain. He doesn't pull it off, whether because he is miscast or because of the writing. The villainous plot elements were poorly scripted and tedious, and few actors could have come out of MIRN winning any awards. Rating: MatinéeThere is just enough action in MIRN to pull off a passable film. There are also a few surprises and an ending that allows one to forgive some of the predictability and tedium of the film. But it's not great. Peace, Tex Shelters",5,1,4,7 August 2015
Dunkirk," What could have been one of the best war films in history is mired in a hash of plots and subplots with little to root for.
","Dunkirk-A Review.Dunkirk is wonderful to look at, however, it is at once too much and too little. There are too many cuts and too many subplots that it is easy to lose interest in what is happening. The cuts come quickly, which works with the air and action scenes, but holding longer on some shots would have allowed us to more deeply feel the gravity of the events. Inevitably, I found myself comparing Dunkirk to other WWII films. It holds up well, with two notable exceptions. First, the intensity and close contact action is not as impactful as the opening to 'Saving Private Ryan.' However, the tension throughout the entirety of 'Dunkirk' surpasses 'Ryan,' which moves aimlessly at times. I also think of the remarkable 'Das Boot', a film that made many sympathize, me included, with Nazis in a submarine. The tension in that German classic is at a level that 'Dunkirk' doesn't match, and 'Das Boot' never relents until the ending. Moreover, in 'Das Boot', we get to know the captain well, how he cares about each man in his command and we see his fear. That makes the film more interesting for us. There is one setting in Das Boot, a submarine, and that's all. The film's limited scope increases the tension and our attachment to each character.What was also lacking in the film was a sense of the war in general. Das Boot was able to show us the futility of war and how the leaders in Germany made huge strategic mistakes. Little of that comes across in Dunkirk. Dunkirk shows a great rescue but ignores the fact that this operation was only required because the Allies underestimated Germany's forces and were outflanked by the Nazi advance when the Allies failed to anticipate a German Blitz through the Ardennes. The military strategists were so inept that the whole British army almost went balls up during the retreat. Not all the subplots in Dunkirk work well. A subplot involving a volunteer civilian ship-mate, George, is awkward and unnecessary. Certainly, Nolan wants us to empathize with all the British citizens who aided in the rescue. He also wants us to understand the 'shell shock' (PTSD) that the soldiers went through. Both the bravery of the volunteers and suffering of the soldiers was clear throughout the film and a tacked on, haphazard conflict on a civilian boat was not well thought out. The scene is an insipid distraction from the core of the film. However, the depictions of shell shock in general were realistic and impactful.There was also a scene featuring a beached vessel that added nothing to the story but another subplot to distract us from more interesting characters and plot lines. In this way, the film is reminiscent of disaster films from the 70s where each character faces life and death challenges and we briefly see what happens to each one of them. But we don't need to see what happens to every character and every way the soldiers were stranded. All the plots and actions leave us too scattered to deeply care about any of them. The acting was surprisingly flat with two exceptions: Mark Rylance as a private ship captain Mr. Dawson and Tom Glynn-Carney who plays his son Peter. More about their story and bravery and less about the tacked on George would have improved this film. Kenneth Branagh as Commander Bolton is a waste of talent here. His dialogue is a clumsy attempt to explain the gravity of the situation, but it added little that the battle footage didn't already show us. Moreover, Branagh's stares into space did nothing for the film. But he does look good in that uniform. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is overwrought and melodramatic, much like John Williams score for Schindler's list, Zimmer wants to make sure we FEEL things. More subtlety would have served this film well. And the unnecessary discordant drones and grinding sounds added to some of the battle scenes were annoying and distracting. The sounds of war: the machines, the engines, the bombs, the bullets, are compelling enough. There was no need to embellish them. I would suggest that Mr. Zimmer stick to standard action films like 'Inception' as I have suggested that Williams stick to films like 'Jaws' and 'Star Wars.' Serious dramas demand less bravado and more nuance. Though the story is bloated with characters and subplots, there were some great directorial choices in 'Dunkirk.' First, the lack of machoism is refreshing. While there is a lot of posturing and anger in the film, what clearly comes across is that many of the soldiers were rightfully scared and enduring as best they could. There were no John Wayne characters on the beaches, or in this case Benjamin Cumberbatch, proclaiming that the British were going to punch the Nazi's in the nose. Another good directorial choice is not stereotyping the Germans as 'evil.' Certainly, the Nazi leadership was a humanity hating force of slaughter, but the film focused of the heroic British, French and other allies. The cinematography is excellent and the cameras were masterfully placed in the film. An award for cinematography could be granted Hoyte Van Hoytema for degree of difficulty alone. Rating: Matinée. What could have been one of the best war films in history is mired in a hash of plots and subplots with little to root for. Still, seeing it in 70 mm is a treat worth the viewing.

Dallas Buyers Club," The Dallas Buyers Club Delivers the Goods
","Can a narcissistic, homophobic, drug addicted, gambling sex addict, and chain smoker make a positive difference through lying and skirting the law? In 'The Dallas Buyers Club', Ron Woodroof does just that. Sure, he's in it for himself, sure he has little or no respect for the members of his buyers club, but through months of contact and shared life tragedy, he begins to care for others, despite himself. His is not a transformation of Biblical proportions. Woodroof is a man who learns first hand what it means to navigate the medical system and deal with the FDA, who is the big villain in the movie, near the beginning of the AIDS epidemic. He may be a homophobe, but he hates the government more and learns to sympathize with gay men, at least in regards to healthcare. His career and his upbringing have taught him that women are for sex, period, and his macho hereto-posturing influences his homophobic reactions in the movie. However, that homophobia gets played back at him as people learn he has AIDS. Jared Leto is excellent as Rayon, a club member and gay sidekick to Ron. His character might be a bit twisted, ala Devine, for the Academy. But he should get an Oscar nomination. As will Matthew McConaguhey. If it wasn't for Chiwetel Ejiofor's performance as the sympathetic Solomon Northup in '12 Years a Slave', McConaguhey would have a good chance at an Oscar. In many ways his performance was harder, more multidimensional and complicated then Ejiofor's. This is a year when two performers could win and would be deserving. But the character of Ron Woodroof is despicable in so many ways (and why I think McConaguhey was so good) that the academy can't give it to him. Besides, Mr. Ejiofor is also Oscar worthy. It was nice to see McConaguhey play another serious role after almost throwing away his talent on terrible romantic comedies (as opposed to the few decent ones, like 'The Notebook'). Speaking of careers ruined by their good looks, Jennifer Garner doesn't suck in this movie. She is adequate as Dr. Saks and she doesn't sleep with the main character in this movie. Congreatulations. Perhaps these two handsome stars can do some serious drama or better written more complicated romantic movies. That would be good for us all. Rating: Pay full price, see it twice.

X-Men: Days of Future Past," There is enough outstanding acting and effects in the film to make it worth seeing on a big screen, but the movie is forgettable.
","X-Men: Days of Future Past, a random point review, off the cuff1. You will never see better acting in a superhero movie. While emoting lines like, 'You sent me from 50 years in the future to stop the sentinels from destroying us all' and other seemingly silly science fiction lines, the actors sound somehow credible.2. The sets and filming are fine, especially a couple of fantastically filmed scenes. No 3D was required. I think the days of the 3D fetish are over and only a few 3D films will be made in the future, those that will benefit from it.3. Costumes, fine, but they didn't make enough of the 70s styles like American Hustle did. 4. Plot, okay. Not great, nothing new, kind of a hodge-podge of plots from Star Trek and X- Men smashed together. 5. The super villain machine. Pathetic, the worst in the movie. While the transports were interesting and different, the monsters, for lack of a better word, were a combination of monsters from Terminator, Thor, and other movies. You would think someone on the creative team could come up with something mildly original. Perhaps a monster based on a centipede...6. Music--I barely noticed it, and that's a good thing. Bonus: There are two scenes that tapped so deeply into my teenage nerd mind, as if Dr. X had contacted that part of my brain, that I was blown away. Seriously. Oh, did I say that Raven/Mystique was fabulous? That Jennifer Lawrence can act, and hopefully she will get better, more challenging roles as her fame increases. Rating: Matinée.

Captain America: Civil War," Better than the recent crop of superhero films, Captain America; Civil War looks at dilemmas many heroes face.
","Captain America: Civil WarI saw this because it was 100+ degrees out,there was nothing else to see in town, and it got good review. So, a short review is in order.Pros: No Pepper Pots, No Hulk, No space aliens, (Head) Human villain played by Daniel Bruhl. No Thor. Spider man's acrobatics. Antman was cool, shockingly, Plot had some surprises, Trailer for Dr. Strange played by Benedict Cumberbatch, Black Panther kicks ass! Captain America is actually not a rule following, annoying, frat boy, kiss ass in this one. Cons: Rhodes in an Ironman suit. What a self-righteous prick. Spiderman's dialogue and childishness, Hawkeye is a waste of time, Wanda the Witch is misused, Vision was NOT a sight to behold, No one died in all the fighting, The plot has big holes, if you care to look, a dearth of decent female superheroes, a weak origin story for Black Panther, Set up had flaws like the fact that no one admitted that without the Avengers, things would be worse. Push: Wanda still a cool character even if out of place, Black Widow also seemed out of place here, Special affects sometimes special, other times, not so much. Rogers is still Captain America. Rating: Matinée There was enough entertainment and an actual plot to bring out the characters. The final battle was not overblown, and while the middle battle was, it was still fun. An actual moral dilemma present in a superhero action film is refreshing even if it is too simply presented.Now, can we have Spiderman and Black Panther join up for a movie without all those other clowns? Call it, 'Good Friends Defeat Umbrella Corp', or some such thing. Peace, Tex Shelters",7,2,8,13 June 2016
The Grand Budapest Hotel," The struggles of the Lumpen Proletariat in a Screw-Ball Comedy that is highly entertaining.
","Wes Anderson's Lumpen HotelWes Anderson's new film, The Grand Budapest Hotel, is a testament to the yearnings of the lumpen proletariat in the fictitious town of Zubrowka in Eastern Europe before WWI. Mr. Gustave, the hotel's long-time concierge gets ahead in the world by pleasing the bourgeois guests of the famous hotel, anticipating their every need. He teaches his right-hand man, Zero the lobby boy, the ways of the world. Their goal is to satisfy the upper crust, and thus, advance in the world that has little in it for them otherwise. The relationship between Gustave and Zero is a delightful symbiosis of master and student. While Gustave thinks he is doing Zero a favor, he benefits from their friendship as much as Zero does.The movie is visually stunning, high-class kitsch. And unlike many of Anderson's other films, the plot in Hotel is well drawn out yet not simple. Ralph Fiennes as Gustave is amazing; he can act out whole scenes with just his facial twitches. Tony Revolori plays Zero Mustafa as a boy, an innocent who is anything but a dullard, with great aplomb considering it's his first major film. Note: As of this writing, neither IMDb nor Rotten Tomatoes lists Mr. Revolori in the credits for the film. That is strange, since he plays the second most important role in the film. The rest of the cast play their roles to various degrees of success. F. Murray Abraham is especially entertaining playing the melancholy yet satisfied Mustafa as an adult.Boiled down to its essence, The Grand Budapest Hotel is a screwball comedy set in a fictionalized nation not unlike the Marx Brothers' Duck Soup. The jokes are more low key and the dialogue is not as ridiculous in Hotel. And to Anderson's credit, the dialogue in Hotel is not pretentious. We can also thanks Fiennes for delivering his lines with tongue-in-cheek sincerity. And of course, the plot is more clever than Duck Soup without being vainglorious as characterizes some of Anderson's other movies.Rating: Full Price The movie is, nor is Anderson, as groundbreaking as other critics state. We won't think of the film as a 'classic' in twenty years, but it's a thoroughly entertaining romp that is meant for the large screen.Peace, Tex Shelters",9,2,7,30 March 2014
Gone Girl," There are just enough good parts, twists and good acting to make this film worth a view.
","Gone Girl is Lost and Barely Alive Question: what is the obsession with calling grown women 'girls'? Even grown women call women girls. Why?Gone Girl is not a complete waste of time. It has an interesting but poorly constructed plot with many inconsistencies. Moreover, there is also not enough back story for the main relationship for us to understand the plot twists at the end of the movie.The filming and cinematography are adequate, but not Oscar nor high-praise worthy. The construction of the plot elements was well thought out, but the unevenness damaged the time-line. The way the married couple meets is awkward, irritating and unrealistic. Frankly, it's phony and embarrassing. There is no chemistry between the characters at the beginning and there is no hint of what would happen in the future of their relationship in their meeting. A little foreshadowing would have done the plot a lot of good.Luckily, the story picks up when Detective Rhonda Boney, played by Kim Dickens, enters the film to investigate the crime scene. She is the best actor in the movie followed by Patrick Fugit, of Almost Famous, who plays second fiddle Detective Nick Gilpin. Rosamond Pike is at times brilliant but not always believable as Amy Dunne and Ben Affleck as Nick Dunne is flat. His best acting is when Mr. Dunne is called on to act the phony. It's sad that Affeck's best lines are when he plays phony. Carrie Coon as the twin sister Margo Dunne is much better than Affleck. Pike does the best with her awkward lines, so props to her. Tyler Perry proves that he should do more serious roles, perhaps as a lead as in his Alex Cross films. How Neil Patrick Harris got into this film is a wonder. He is only under-acted by Affleck. Suffice to say, the cast got little help from an at times hackneyed script.The grand plot twist at the beginning of the second act was predictable. They did play this twist well, until a supposedly clever and brilliant character does something incredibly dumb. Smart characters doing dumb things doesn't fly with me.Rating: Matinée There are just enough good parts, twists and good acting to make this film worth a view. The plot is fascinating, but played poorly. Unfortunately, Ben Affleck could not portray the conflicted nature of his character to make us believe his actions. The film needed a better lead, such as Josh Brolin (only for years the senior of Affleck), to make it work. Affleck only has his looks to rescue him, but no one is that good looking. Moreover, if the relationship's beginning had been left out of the film and more about their marriage years put in the movie, it could have been a better film.

Room," Room: One Skylight, Two Great Performances, and Four Walls make one great film.
","'Room' starts in the middle of a horrifying tale of abduction with little back story and little history. And that works wonder. It places us right in the middle of the claustrophobia of the two main characters, Joy and her son Jack. The first third of the film made me almost as uncomfortable as I was during the whole masterpiece film, 'The Act of Killing.' There are so many times when this film could have gone awry, sappy and melodramatic. In fact, the sappiest thing about the film was the music, being far too uplifting and loud for the themes in the movie. The framing of each shot in the first-third of the movie augments the feeling of being trapped. The shots are as beautiful as they are terrifying. The acting of the two main characters is spot on, especially the five-year-old boy Jake, played by Jacob Tremblay. Brie Larson plays the complicated role of Joy, the mother, who goes through untold agony. We aren't told what happens in detail; we see it on her face, in her body.There were so many times this film could have gone for cheap sentimentality; they could have gone for the easy reconciliation and happy ending, and it didn't. Put one in the win column for small, well writing, well directed and well acted cinema that doesn't involve stunts or explosions. Rating: Pay Full Price'Room' is excellent. While it didn't play for cheap emotion and the issues it addresses are horrifying, it could have used more detail regarding the aftermath of events for the mother. The son's issues were dealt with well if not completely. The framing of the shots? Fantastic! The music? Terrible. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay deserve Oscars nominations.

The Imitation Game," 'The Imitation Game' fully utilizes the medium of film to nearly perfect effect.
","'The Imitation Game' is an OriginalThe only complaint I have about 'The Imitation Game' is the title of the movie. It's off-putting and doesn't give prospective viewers any idea what the film is about. 'The Imitation Game' was the name of a mind-game the protagonist, math genius Alan Turing, played to learn about people. But the movie isn't about that game. It's about breaking the Nazi Germany Enigma code and the struggles Turing and his team go through to solve the code. Better names for the movie would be: 'Breaking the Nazi Code' (or just 'Breaking the Code' which would have a double meaning for the film) 'Decoding the Nazi War Machine' 'Beating Nazis at its Code Game' 'Nerds Take Down the Nazis' 'Take that Enigma!' 'No more Heil to Hitler'Okay, some of those were serious, others not. The truth is, this is an excellent film, what great films can be, and I am worried the title will keep away viewers. It is a historical costume drama, and the English are often very good at that. The acting is superb, especially Cumberbatch. There are few false notes. That is to the acting and also an excellent script. The writers were able to propel the drama with the dialogue and put in some humour that allows us to learn about the characters along the way. No scene was added just to be dramatic; they all had duel purposes whether telling us about the relationships of the characters or demonstrating their struggles while continuing to lay out the plot. Of course the sets, edits and lighting were excellent; they had the budget to pull it off. The musical score is good and seldom noticed; the director didn't need to employ over-wrought music to force us have emotions. The drama spoke for itself. 'The Imitation Game' was able to do what 'The Theory of Everything' struggled with. First, there are three different time periods in 'The Imitation Game' and the edits and transition back and forth between those periods are nearly flawlessly. 'Theory' struggles with that. Also, 'Imitation' showed us different aspects of Turing's life, personal, scientific, work, as parts of a whole without leaving us with nagging, unanswered questions. 'Theory' was not nearly as good at that. Both films have stellar acting and plenty of nerd appeal, but if you can see only one, see 'Imitation.' It is a much more human film where the emotion didn't play as false. Both are worth watching.Rating: Pay full price, see it twice. This may be the first time I have given a non-documentary full ratings. One of best aspects of the film is that war is not glorified while the need to defeat Hitler was made imperative. The film doesn't shy away from the British government's bigotry (and that of many people), hypocrisy and the tough choices the people who broke the Enigma code had to face. The film doesn't wallow in the tragedy like an after-school special, but it shows the warts and ugliness Turing had to face in mid-century England while breaking the 'impossible' puzzle of Enigma. Peace, Tex Shelters",9,6,15,2 January 2015
Selma," Good acting, uneven directing, a decent script and a quality film score make for a compelling drama.
","The directing for Selma was pedestrian but not terrible for a first-timer. The camera work offers no surprises nor innovations and there is nothing about the blocking of scenes, whether in churches, on the streets or on the bridge, that enhances the action and drama. The upshot is that Selma is mainly by the books directing but over use of camera gimmickry didn't distract us from the story. It's average and adequate, not terrible, directing. Give credit to the writers and director for showing the flaws and foibles as well as the successes and brilliance of Dr. King in his entirety. No man is perfect, and to portray him as such would have been a discredit to his legacy. Not only are his oft presented infidelities touched upon, but his doubts about his abilities and his leadership mistakes are also part of the film. What makes King and so many leaders in the film remarkable is that they overcame their imperfections to do great things. David Oyelowo put in an Oscar worthy performance as Dr. King but failed to get a nomination. His character wasn't mentally or physically challenged, and let's face, not White. Yes, and his name isn't Denzel Washington. But if you play a White man who admits to killing dozens of people, that earns you an Oscar nod. I haven't seen 'Sniper', and I am sure Mr. Cooper is great. However, this is an unfortunate slight given the difficulty of playing the historical legend and the quality of the performance. One of my favorite actresses from last year, Tessa Thompson of 'Dear White People', plays the firebrand radical Diane Nash. She doesn't get nearly enough screen time for me. However, she probably got the time her character warranted for the story. Actors playing Andrew Young (Andre Holland) and John Lewis (Stephen James) are also excellent. Nigel Thatch in a brief appearance plays Malcolm X perfectly. And the always entertaining Tim Roth plays to his strength of portraying deranged men, this time, Gov. Wallace. One unfortunate choice was putting a rap song at the end of the movie when there are so many period songs or spirituals that would be more appropriate. I assume it was part of the deal to fund the film and get Common on board as one of the actors. 'Glory' is a good song, and Legend is a great singer. And if it got the movie produced, fine. It is, however, out of place. As for the controversy about LBJ: Tom Wilkinson does a good job portraying the conflicted president. From what I know about Johnson, the portrait was fair and accurate. Carmen Ejogo played Coretta King with the dignity required, though her role suffered from inattentive writing and wasn't well flushed out. Rating: Pay Full Matinée PriceSelma is entertaining though too long in moments. Tighter editing would have helped with the pacing. A bigger budget may have given the director more opportunities to be creative with the shots. The angles, lighting and pacing didn't match the gravity of the story. The dialogue worked well for the time and place of the movie. Peace, Tex Shelters",7,2,6,19 January 2015
Snowden," A realistic portrait of a controversial figure who history, and the victors, will judge.
","Snowden: A packet of good bytes Oliver Stone directs another political thriller, Snowden. Director Stone reveals uncomfortable truths about the government in Snowden as movies like 'Salvador', 'Missing' and many films about the Vietnam war did. The film argues that it is patriotic to tell the truth about the spying the U.S. has done in the name of security and that the spying that interferes with our rights is unpatriotic. Supporters of PRISM and the NSA spying argue that if you have nothing to hide, then you should not be worried about being spied on. Let's suppose that is true. Then the government should have nothing to hide regarding the surveillance of citizens of the U.S. and the world. Why are they afraid to let the U.S. citizens know about their surveillance programs if there is nothing wrong with it, if they have nothing to hide? It's not like foreign intelligence services don't already know they are being spied on and that the leaks let them in on a secret of some kind. What Snowden did was let the American people know about the spying, and that was a threat to many in the government. The acting in 'Snowden' is excellent. Gordon-Levitt has Snowden's vocal cadence and tone down. Quinto as Greenwald does well as does Leo as filmmaker Laura Poitras. The most powerful performance however, is Rhys Ifans who plays Snowden's mentor Corbin O'Brian. He is a great foil to Levitt's Snowden. He is charming, friendly and also threatening. Sometimes all at once. The actors playing Snowden's co-workers are also top notch as is Shailene Woodley as Snowden's girlfriend, Lindsay Mills. The film looks great using a variety of shots for a variety of purposes.Negative critiques of the film find it 'fawning' over Snowden. That's what happens in a biopic. Did these same critics complain about Spielberg's fawning over Lincoln? Did Spike Lee Fawn over Malcolm X? Or is the truth that they are judging the film by how they feel about Snowden himself? Snowden is apparently too controversial to deserve positive coverage, a film showing his actions as heroic. And what appears to gall some of these critics most is that Stone succeeds in making a case for Snowden as hero. What is shown in the film is the extent to which we are being watched and tracked, the extent to which our lives are being monitored. This multi-billion dollar surveillance regimen of our citizenry has had little if any success in ending threats to our nation and hardly seems worth it. Just because you can do something doesn't mean you do it. However, few people know the fact of this, and if you make a film about Snowden, you better tow the party line and repeat the lies about his actions being a threat to national security of the outing of people. The facts are that Snowden never included the names of agents in his reports. Their names were redacted as were ongoing operations. What he revealed was the extent to which the government is watching us. I disagreed with the choice of putting the real Snowden in the film at the end. I wonder if Stone thought this would make Snowden and his story more real to some of the audience. I also wondered if putting Snowden in the film with a couple of spoken lines earned him some extra money. Fine. And the seemingly glib smile on Snowden's face when he left his assignment in Hawaii seemed out of place to me. A 'Mona Lisa' smile would have been more appropriate considering the gravity of the situation. The film makes clear that the government abused our trust and that we must be constantly vigilant to protect our rights. Rating: Pay full price. The acting is excellent on all counts and the film is dramatic throughout despite the slow start.

Love & Mercy," An excellent film of talent triumphing without super-human powers.
","Love & Mercy Hits the High and the Low Notes of Wilson's LifeLove and Mercy is new film about Brian Wilson's long history with mental illness and how he struggled through it to write, Pet Sounds and other well known works including their best selling, 'Good Vibrations.'His father and his brothers pathologically compete against the music for Brian's attention in his early years. In his later years, Dr. Landry played with slimy precision by Paul Giamatti, takes control of his life, his finances and his music like a parasite. Many of the causes of Wilson's mental illness are shown in the film without excessive analysis. The film only hints at whether being mentally unhinged can lead to great art. I don't know, but what I do know is that it has been part of Brian Wilson's creative process from the start of the Beach Boys. The album Pet Sounds, written almost entirely by Brian Wilson, also has a starring role. The film does well in portraying Wilson's manic, creative composing style. He has command over what is being played, how it is being played, the rhythm, the attack on the notes, everything. His brilliance is confirmed in the film 'The Wrecking Crew.' In that documentary, many of the studio musicians discussed Wilson's command and artistry of the music. Today, Pet Sounds is considered one of the greatest pop albums of all times by a majority of critics. At the time, however, many critics panned the album. In the film, his brothers take this opportunity to chide him for the bad reviews, saying that he had veered too far from the 'Beach Boy's sound.' Co-founder of the band Mike Love is portrayed as a real jerk at this moment and throughout the film, trying to bully Brian into abandoning his new musical direction. Today, the audience knows that Wilson was correct about the album. It is a master work. And by the way, Love wrote most of the tepid, cloying and adolescently simple-minded lyrics for the Beach Boys. His part of the song-writing is the weakest part of their songs.The film starts in the near past with John Cusack playing Wilson as an older man. The film switches further back into the past to show cleverly filmed reenactments of the the Beach Boys on tour with Paul Dano playing the younger Wilson on stage. Dano outshines John Cusack in the beginning of the film. However, as the film continues, the situation Wilson finds himself in as a middle aged man clarifies itself, making Cusack's underplayed acting more powerful and Wilson more sympathetic. Facts about Pet Sounds http://mentalfloss.com/article/59457/15-facts-about-pet-soundsMcCartney's Comments on Pet Sounds http://albumlinernotes.com/Paul_McCartney_Comments.htmlRating: Pay full price. You don't have to be a Beach Boys fan to appreciate the story of an artist who struggles through adversity. Wilson prevails without parades, cheering crowds, or phone calls from the president. He is down to earth and human, not otherworldly. In a film industry that is currently obsessed with superheroes, it's nice to see a film where a talented, regular guy succeeds.

Sicario," While not a complete mess, 'Sicario' loses its focus on more than one occasion..
","'Sicario' Misses the Target'Sicario' is a U.S./Mexico border drama aboutwellI'm not sure what it's about, and that's the main problem with the film. It lack coherence and focus. The film starts off centered on F.B.I. Agent Kate Macer and her desire for revenge. Then it becomes a film about the questionable morals of federal policing agencies on the border. Then it mutates into a revenge film about a completely different character. That might work if the plot was not so logically flawed. It might also work if we had more of a back-story on the characters. In one scene, Agent Macer takes home a Phoenix cop. It's clearly a set up, and we are expected to believe a trained F.B.I. agent would fall for such an obvious ploy. There is nothing to suggest that she is easily fooled or that the people behind it are that clever. Besides, the plan relies on coincidence and there is no guarantee that it would work. It is based on stereotypical notions of female weakness and illogic and clashes with the notion that Macer is a tough agent. If we knew she had made mistakes of judgement in the past, it might have been more credible. However, almost no backstory is provided for her character. Macer is a patsy, which is fine, but then why make her the main character? And if she is the main character, why move away from her entirely during a large portion of the film? It is because the film, for all its pretense at making a smart, complex drama is plot driven and the characters are secondary. Thus, the actions that the plot dictates don't make sense for who the characters are. Visually, the film looks flat. Certainly, part of that is because of the filming in low-light situations. I wonder if it is also because some of it was filmed in HD video, or was it? The music is good, meaning, I didn't notice it. What holds this film together at all is the acting. Brolin, Blunt and Del Toro are as good a trio of actors as you can find in film, and they deliver. Too bad none of them are let off the reins so we can appreciate their talents. Critics are fond of discussing the film they wanted to see and then slamming films for not satisfying their preconceptions. So, here it goes. The film needed to focus on either agent Macer or Alejandro (Del Toro) and complete their tale of revenge. Neither of these characters' actions are clever and in fact, they are quite predictable. Good thing the drug lords are easily duped and overpowered. Rating: Rent it.There is no reason to see this in the theater, except perhaps the beautiful overhead shots of the border between El Paso and Juarez. The film attempts to address large themes of betrayal, honor, corruption and revenged, but it misses the target. Peace, Tex Shelters",5,5,11,14 October 2015
The Disaster Artist," This Brilliant Satire will Make you Laugh and Cringe
","The Disaster Artist: Bringing Back the SatireThe Disaster Artist is about the making of 'the Citizen Kane of bad films,' 'The Room.' It's also about its director, writer, star and producer, Tommy Wiseau. It's the most loving, hilarious tribute to an artistic misfit since Spinal Tap. The difference is, Wiseau is incredibly enough, not a fictional character. Star James Franco will tell you that the film is about the making of 'The Room', but every scene of the film is infused with Mr. Wiseau's essence. Franco embodies him fully. Franco calls upon his own challenges as a successful creative artist and twists it to show us how it would affect him if he had failed. Wiseau is as lovingly portrayed as this man 'from another planet,' Tommy's planet, could be. Franco was the man to tell the story. Greg, Dave Franco (yes, James Franco's brother), is Wiseau's supportive best friend. I never fully understood why he stuck it out with Wiseau. But in the end, Greg saves Wiseau from complete despair. The rest of the cast is good. In fact, not even the underwhelming, one joke wonder Seth Rogen annoyed me in this one.The film follows Tommy's journey from obscurity to obscurity as he takes wrong turns. Even his good looking friend Greg can't get an audition in Los Angeles. Then Greg says, 'Let's make our own movie,' as a joke. 'Yeah!' says Tommy, and The Room is born. It's hard to imagine that 'The Room' was an attempt at serious film making. It plays that way in 'The Disaster Artist,' however. Every directorial, acting, and script decision is off the mark. It's a master course in what not to do when making a film. Or is it genius satire? Not according to Franco's film. This tragic comedy is a small contained slice of life that doesn't try to me more than a hilarious and entertaining tribute. Rating: Pay Full Price

Whiplash," Whiplash is an entertaining look at obsession in the arts
","Whiplash Changes TempoWhiplash is a film above all about struggle, the struggle within ourselves and the struggle we have with the influences in our life: our family, our mentors and our artistic challengers. Andrew, played by the talented Miles Teller, is a young drumming prodigy, or is he? Is he the next Buddy Rich or Max Roach? Andrew admires his mentor, Fletcher, played by J.K. Simmons. Simmons won an Oscar for the playing the megalomaniacal band leader who thinks he has the power to beat greatness into his students through abuse, name-calling, manipulation, lies, whatever it takes to be great. One big question left standing at the end of the movie is whether abusive teaching works for the most talented of artists, if it can make them that much greater.Whiplash is a more dramatic and less smarmy look at the entertainment industry than Birdman. Whiplash doesn't beg for us to notice how clever it is at every turn, it's not predictable, and while we are not clear where the protagonists will go at the end of the film, it doesn't need to invoke magical realism and mysticism to be a mystery. Other than both being compound nouns and about the entertainment industry, the two films are world's apart.Whiplash is not your typical film about an artist climbing to the top. Few films give so much time to the importance of mentorship in the artists' lives. Few films explore the obsession of the the art itself that leads one to desire to be 'one of the greats.' And the film isn't talking about the obsession of drugs and alcohol or some abusive family that leads artists to greatness. Like many artist we consider great, his obsession stems from his inner demons of not knowing what else he would do with his life without it and his insecurities in a world where the next guy on drums might be better. If he can't play like Elvin Jones, than what's the point? Unlike most of us who either aren't willing to do what it takes to be great or are content with what talent we do have, artists (athletes, scientists, writers ) who become the best have a different mindset. Whiplash lays that out for us to see in an entertaining form. And when you think you caught the beat of Whiplash, it turns on us like modern jazz and ups the tempo. But it never plays down to us. Whiplash surprises with the plot twists and just when you think it goes to far, that it has played out, the key changes and leaves us wondering.

Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Birdman: A Smart Movie with a Stupid Ending
","There is a movie making the rounds of the award shows about an actor who was last widely known for playing a famous superhero in tights. He is attempting a comeback doing something artsy, not unlike Michael Keaton in Birdman. Because it's self-reflexive, it must be FABULOUS! Well, not so much. But it is usually smart and oft entertaining. Like a piece of lesser-known theater, it has its moments. There are some things that are fabulous in Birdman. First, the bits of magical realism throughout the film work quite well, until the ending. Second, there is Ed Norton chewing up the scenery with controlled, skillful over-acting. And last on the list of the fabulous is the jazz drumming that follows the actors as they wind their way through the maze of rooms: dressing, make-up, costumes, and through the stage rigging, the lights and other tools of the trade found backstage at a Broadway theater. The other acting is as good as its script allows. Emma Stone is fun as Sam, Riggan's (Birdman) daughter, but her petulance becomes irksome after awhile. We fail to see one moment of genuine emotion from the character, even when showing her concern for her father. Her father, Riggan, is played adequately by Michael Keaton, but the famous actor down-on-his- luck schtick is tiresome. Riggan takes himself so seriously that he is a bore. Somehow, I believe that was NOT the intent of the director/writer Iñárritu. Naomi Watts is adequate, but her character's lines about trying to 'make it on Broadway' were repeated too many times for me to care. It wasn't so much her acting that annoyed me, her hackneyed and out of place dialogue. If she improvised them, well, then it was her acting. Zach Galifianakis was surprisingly not the most annoying one in the movie this time. He plays the straight man, the producer of the play, to counterbalance all the lunacy of the actors. He keeps it together and does a fine job. Iñárritu is making an artistic comeback himself as the writer and director of 'Birdman', not receiving this much acclaim since his first feature, 'Amores Perros', a much more compelling drama. 'Birdman' is interesting and clever with all its metaphor and fantasy. The problem is that Iñárritu could not get away from magical realism long enough to make a coherent ending. And as we all know, a terrible ending can turn a good film into a mediocre film. That, unfortunately, is what happens to 'Birdman.' It's treatment is so unusual, but its theme of a washout actor making a comeback so worn out, that a cogent ending was needed to make it work. The camera work and editing are excellent, as are the sets. The script is at times brilliant and at other moments, mundane. Another run-through by actors and other writers may have brought some needed realism to the magic on the screen. As far as New York goes, the city plays its part well, as always. Rating: MatinéeIt's fair, but for a better, harder hitting film featuring a washed-out actor, rent 'Sunset Boulevard.'Peace, Tex Shelters",6,0,5,28 January 2015
The Big Short," 'The Big Short' is educational, relevant and entertaining.
","Nothing Small about 'The Big Short''The Big Short' is based on the book with the same name by financial journalist Michael Lewis. It is about collateralized debt obligations, subprime mortgages, credit default swaps and bundling. A snoozer right? Not one bit. 'The Big Short' is more entertaining than most films in the cineplex this holiday season. Even if you don't know much about the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007-08, you will recognize a quality film and want to know more about the world economic collapse when the film is over. The film uses a multitude of techniques to tell the story. There are fourth-wall breaking monologues, a model in a bubble bath explaining economics as well as a singing idol and a celebrity chef using metaphors of cooking and gambling to explain the economic crisis. There are jump cuts, slow motion, foreshadowing and flash backs. The filmmakers use any and all tricks to explain a complicated mess of financial chicanery in order to help the audience understand. The banks, mortgage brokers, the credit ratings agencies and the government manipulated people in the nation and world into investing in worthless packages of bonds, and it behooves the director and writer, Adam McKay, to use all cinematic tricks to explain and untangle the financial corruption. The miracle is that the film deciphers the economic melt-down well while entertaining its audience. The acting is stellar from the stars to the bit players. They aren't just playing a role, they embody characters during a remarkable time in history. My mother thinks Steve Carrell was the best actor in the film, for she did not even recognize him at first. He plays against character and she liked that. However, my mother had never seen Carrell in 'The Office.' His character, Mark Baum, is much like the boss from that television series. However, in 'The Big Short', he plays it straight. He is a boss of a fund under the umbrella of Morgan Stanley (but it's not Morgan Stanley, and his team likes to point out), and he is on a mission to bring down banks, to show them up, and to prove he's been right about the financial warning signs. He is betting against the hand that feeds him, Morgan Stanley.I preferred Christian Bale's performance as Michael Burry, an unselfconscious, manic math genius. I haven't seen that frightening look in Bale's eyes since 'American Psycho', but this time he's only killing the mortgage backed securities market. Meanwhile, Brad Pitt, under- playing another disaffected former banker, Brad Rickert, helps two friends make millions while they bet against terrible investments, or 'play short' the mortgage market. His backstory is revealed steadily and in a way that makes us wonder why he briefly got back into the investment 'game.' Even Ryan Gosling makes his mark in this star-studded cast playing the prescient 'Jared Vennett.' Remember, all the characters in the film are based on real people. And that is what makes it so remarkable. The other major players in the film are Bear Stearns, Morgan Stanley, and a slew of investment houses who at best ignore the coming financial crisis or at worst, colluded in its creation. From the realtors selling the mortgages, to the banks loaning at subprime, to the banks bundling the worthless packages, they were all making too much money to want to stop. This is exactly the kind of over-exuberance that occurred in the 1920s stock market crash, but few payed attention then or in 2007. 'The Big Short' is a dramatized film of true events. And to make sure we understand, the actors break the fourth wall several times to tell us what part is true to the detail and what part is fictionalized to make it more dramatic. But if you are still incredulous, read the book. The events are all sadly true, and we are still paying for it. Rating: Pay full price (but you might want to see it twice.) It will take at least two viewings to catch half of what is embedded in this film. This film is entertaining, educational and relevant. Peace, Tex Shelters",9,346,386,28 December 2015
Straight Outta Compton," A visually and musically interesting story of one of the most influential bands in hip hop history.
","'Straight Outta Compton' has Something to Say NWA is credited with creating gangster rap, also know as reality rap for singing about the reality of the lives they lived. NWA lead to not only million selling albums for the band and their three main members, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and Eazy E, but to Tupac, Snoop Dogg and more. NWA was more than recording artists, they spoke for millions all over the nation who were oppressed by the police, including the 'Black police showing out for the white cop.' The racist L.A. Police has had a history of abusing the rights of African Americans, especially in the 80s. That is one of the catalysts for gangster rap along with the war on drugs and crushing Reaganomics. Were the NWA performers the most talented in the L.A. scene? Certainly Dr. Dre and Ice Cube were. Eazy E comes off as a bit of a dupe and lessor talent. However, Jason Mitchell plays the rapper well. The son of Ice Cube, O'Shea Jackson Jr., is excellent and he looks just like dad. Paul Giamatti plays a thieving white prick with aplomb. The rest of the cast also does well. The scenes of the band performing on stage and in the studio are real standouts. The cinematography is excellent as is the sound mixing. The plot holds together, but like a turducken, they cram too much in. There is no way they could have put every event in the lives of NWA in the film. Even so, some of the scenes are too long for their minimal content. Scenes are held too long after the point is made and story elements are evident. There are a few moments of self reflection in the film that weren't needed, and frankly, some of the exposition was redundant. Otherwise, 'Straight Outta Compton' is an entertaining and educational film. Rating: Full PriceSome of the sexism of NWA, and in Dr. Dre and Ice Cube's lyrics, comes out in the film; that is unfortunate. However, that is who they seem to be, and to be otherwise, would be false. The film does cover some familiar biopic band territory of member's squabbling, producers ripping them off and so forth. It is most handled in an interesting way except from the drawn out scene with their manager, Jerry.In all, it's a well produced film with great musical performances and a good hip-hop soundtrack from the days when hip-hip was still political and relevant and more than just a commercial success.

Mother!," An exploitation film pretending to be art is still an exploitation film.
","mother!, oh brother!'mother!' is a film that is trying to shock us but it craps out into ridiculousness. Trying to make their point leads to exploitation. I started yelling Get Out! inside my head near the end of the first act when mother! was having a bad time. She just didn't leave. Neither did I when the signs of a disaster of a film appeared. Their house, the house of mother! and man, is in the middle of nowhere. And I don't care. Earth is also in the middle of nowhere astronomically, if you know what I mean, and do you think inhabitants of other worlds care? I don't think so. Yes, 'mother!' is a multi-allegory story. It looks good, but it lacks story craft and subtlety. It smacks us relentlessly in the face with drama and terrible human behavior. Or is it terrible? The behavior was obviously out of the norm. And we are supposed to accept it because it's an allegory about the world and god. Woo hoo! It's just stupid and obvious and not compelling at all.Rating: I want my money back. An exploitation film pretending to be art is still an exploitation film. Peace, Tex Shelters",2,15,24,19 September 2017
Lucy," 'Lucy' Maximizes the Sci-Fi Genre to Near 100%
","'Lucy' Maximizes the Sci-Fi Genre to Near 100% Most of the best sci-fi movies are about ideas. The Day the Earth Stood Still, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Fahrenheit 451, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner, Inception are examples of this. Then there are those sci-fi movies that have relied more on technology and special effects than ideas. (See Transformers.) However, when science fiction combines both ideas and technology, the genre can be one of the most entertaining in cinema. Lucy does just that. The ideas in Lucy are no less universal than the purpose of life on this planet and what it means to be human. And like 2001, A Space Odyssey, the film offers no pat answers to these questions. Lucy gets abducted by Japanese thugs in a fancy Taiwanese hotel and taken to a room where she meets their boss. The gangsters want to know what is in the case her now ex-boyfriend has cuffed to her left arm. Lucy doesn't know, but she learns later what she has. Some critics question the fact that Japanese business men, mobsters really, don't speak English. The fact is, we don't know if they speak English. What we do know is that they refuse to speak English, and that makes Lucy even more frightened and the scene more foreboding as she is questioned by the criminals. Moreover, the lack of subtitles for the Japanese spoken in the scene helps us empathize with Lucy's situation; we don't know what is happening any more than she does. Lucy isn't drawn out or overly mellow-dramatic. Scarlett Johansson does a good job as Lucy, a strange and multi-dimensional character even though we have little to no back-story for the character. That doesn't matter, for Lucy's motivation comes from the changes she goes through in the film. Lucy is what good science fiction can be. It has action, philosophy, and big ideas. What surprises me are all the critiques of the science in Lucy, some from people who loved Inception, Transformers or The Edge of Tomorrow, films with even less plausible scientific under-pinnings. It's as if critics forgot what the phrase 'science fiction' means. Movies are about suspending disbelief and being carried away. Lucy let's us do just that. Lucy is not omnipotent like Neo of the Matrix films. She clearly does not have all the answers, and she doesn't have to. Her answers to her existence are more like Buddhist koans, not pronouncements of her divinity. A friend told me that Johansson is charismatic, that the camera likes her. Wrong, I said, the camera loves her. And I am not just talking about her sultriness. In Lucy, she makes it easy to care about the enigmatic title character. Morgan Freeman's Professor Norman is not as well developed. As we meet him, he is presenting a talk on neuroscience and his theories about the brain to a group in Paris. The talk is the weak spot in the movie, although the character of Norman improves as he interacts with Lucy. One of the most contentious ideas in the film is that 'we only use 10% of our brain.' First, there is no evidence for this, and secondly, there is evidence that over a life-time, 100% of our brains get used, just not all at once. Perhaps the idea is that only 10% of our neurons can fire at one time. The film is not clear on that. I refer you to my earlier statement; it is science fiction. If you can accept the idea that some people can better access their brain's capacity, i.e. Einstein, Kepler, Tesla, Hawking, and so forth, then it is not hard to accept the idea that perhaps there is more potential in the brain than we realize. Thus, we have Lucy. Bonus: The editing is excellent; it makes want me to become an editor of cinema. I will go out on a limb and say that Lucy will win the Oscar for best editing. The music is interesting but stays out of the way of the movie. Lucy reminds me in many ways of 2001: A Space Odyssey, especially toward the end of the film. After nearly 50 years, Kubrick's classic is still influencing cinema. Weaknesses: Some of the dialogue is banal. Mostly, it doesn't get in the way of the ideas and action in the movie. Another irksome problem with the film is the lack of explanation of some plot elements, such as why Lucy was studying in Taiwan and how did she get into a jail cell after her kidnapping. A couple of well-placed lines of dialogue could have solved that issue. Rating: Pay full price; see it twice. Lucy is not a perfect film, and I could nitpick and rate it down a bit. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the action and ideas and was not in any way put off by the imperfect science. It didn't drag on, it entertained me, and it left me thinking. That's what good science fiction is about. Peace, Tex Shelters",9,6,16,1 August 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Episode VII is an entertaining ball of fluff.
","Star Wars: The Series re-AwakensStar Wars has been rebooted by going back to the future. Many of the characters and plot elements that made original 1977 film classic were brought back, to hearty applause of the audience where I attended. Even the Millennium Falcon got a big cheer. Moreover, many new characters, played by ACTUAL actors, were introduced and accepted into the mythology of the series. The Star Wars franchise lost it's originality and spirit gradually from the first to the third film (episodes IV-VI) and fell off the cliff with 'Episode One, 'Phantom Menace' (EOFM). Episode Six, 'Return of the Jedi' went from curious to terrible with the introduction of the Ewoks and the Christian savior ending with Darth Vader, who killed millions, destroyed a planet and was consumed by the dark side of the force most of his life. Somehow, Vader found salvation by asking for forgiveness on his death bed. I vowed never to see another Star Wars film after the Ewoks and the Darth Vader salvation nonsense. However, my girlfriend at the time convinced my to see Episode I, so I went. 'Fantom Menace' featured the racially insensitive Jar-Jar Binks, a terrible actor for the pivotal Anikan Skywalker, and a lot of talking instead of action. My girlfriend and I were both appalled at the clearly racist Jar-Jar character, among others. Again, I vowed never to see another Star Wars film, and I didn't see episode II and III. It appears I didn't miss much. However, another important women in my life, my mother, convinced me to see 'Episode VII: The Force Awakens.' And it was as advertised: a return to the classic with more action than talking, a western in space. The Ewoks moment in Episode VII is the drone, BB8, which must stand for 'Ball Bot 8', right? It was an improbable rolling ball robot, and it was used as a plot device much like R2D2 was in Episode IV. Fortunately, they didn't go over-board with the droid and have it kill storm troopers. The film was cheesy and with many improbably plot elements, and that didn't matter. It was fun. And the man having the most fun in the film was Harrison Ford, reprising his role as Han Solo. My mother and I agreed that he brought the fun back to the series. Besides fun-time Ford, the new actors did not disappoint, mainly Daisy Ridley as the swash- buckling motor-head, Rey and John Boyega as the run-away storm trooper, Finn. Both Ridley and Boyega break with Star Wars tradition by acting conflicted about their actions, carrying more than on emotion at one time, and by being more than just card-board cutouts spewing dialogue. This break with terrible acting tradition, and I also mean you Hamill, Ford and Fisher, help propel and carry the film's flimsy plot. Adam Driver scares and intimidates with or without a mask as Darth Vader's heir, Kylo Ren. There were some great decisions over his mask in the film. While episodes I-III had laughable villains with terrible dialogue, Ren lives up to the task of dark lord and Driver carries it well. Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron, the 'best pilot in the resistance', is misused and would have been much better cast as a villain of the dark side. His role is under-written and plays too much like a frat boy. Otherwise, the casting was a step above previous Star Wars films. The music is fine, and the effects are spectacular, which is no surprise. The dialogue has some gems and some groaners which is par for the course. There are some funny call-backs to the first three films and much of the plot is rehashed from episode IV, and that is fine. For older audience members, it is nostalgic; for younger audience members, it is the first time they have seen a good Star Wars film. Rating: MatinéeI certainly can't rate it as high as 'The Room' or 'The Big Short', other films on screens currently. However, for Star Wars fans young and old and forever, this Star Wars re-awakens the franchise and is an entertaining romp of fluff. Peace, Tex Shelters",7,2,9,28 December 2015
Deadpool," Deadpool is a perfectly serviceable superhero film that collapses into a puddle of mediocrity.
","Deadpool is a Perfectly Serviceable Superhero Film'Deadpool' tries hard to be unique with its clever voice-overs and dialogue, its flash backs and foreshadowing. But the harder it tries to be different, the more it is the same. There are damsels in distress, a revenge tale, a face off between the damaged superhero and the deranged supervillain and on and on. They even tell you in the credits about all the typical elements of a superhero movie that will be present. The credits are, to their credit, very funny. There is an origin story that is quite interesting, but there is also the too long courting ritual and the overly long bar scene (what the hell, directors, bars aren't that interesting!) showing us where the hero gets his name. While the romantic coupling in the film is extremely unlikely and it is a boring plot device that takes us away from the real action. The fight scene at the beginning of the film is very entertaining and well choreographed; however, they seemed to have run out of ideas by the time of the great, and predictable, final showdown. I know it is hard to come up with new ideas for a superhero movie, and 'Deadpool' does a fairly good job of presenting a different kind of tale. However, the film gets a case of the 'box office flu' and puts in a lot of standard and unfortunately predictable elements in the film. Sure, Deadpool's origin story is well done if not original. And his living situation is unique, to say the least. But the romance falls flat and is out of place. The times when the movie is more entertaining is during the conflict with the cruel villain, 'Francis' and during the development of Deadpool's powers. The bar scene is too long, the sex scene it superfluous and not clever, and much of the film is filler for the action scenes. Perhaps I have seen too many superhero films and I am too critical to sit through them and accept the genre's failings. Dead Pool gives me little hope that this will change. The film looks okay, but after the original fight scene, its visuals are nothing spectacular. The acting is average, at best, and Morena Baccarin seems out of place in many of the scenes. She's not sure how to play the role of the victim or how to be overly sexual and in love. To be fair, she's not known for nuance and her role is terribly written. The writing in general is too clever by five-eighths; it's dull and after a while, tiresome. The film's humour and sentimentality don't mix well at all. In fact, the film is best and most powerful when it eschews sentimentality. If the film had ended after thirty minutes, I would have given it high marks. However, it collapsed into a puddle of mediocrity. This does not bode well for the upcoming, supposedly genre bending superhero film, 'Suicide Squad.' A better version of the 'Deadpool' would have had the 'hero' in a cab all day going from one villain's hideout to the next and causing a ruckus. Ratings: MatinéeThere are clever bits interspersed in the film like a sketch comedy show, and that kept me entertained for some the show. If you really like this genre, then by all means, see 'Deadpool.' If you don't enjoy superhero films, there is nothing in this film to change that. Stan Lee's cameo is a bonus, however.

Spectre," Bond films revert back to pre-Skyfall form, and it's not good.
","James Bond is Back, and He's Predictable as EverAfter seeing Skyfall, I was worried that Bond films had lost their way. But with Spectre, Bond has returned to form. He's back to his obvious womanizing; even the credits were some of the most sexist I have seen in years. This Bond film also went back to hiring a musical performer, Sam Smith, that doesn't have the gravitas to carry the theme song as Adele did in the last film after years of mediocre songs. What I'm saying is the song and performance stinks. I am glad to see they've brought the mediocrity back. Instead of discussing all the ways Spectre went back to formula, let's talk about the unique things in the film. First, the script was so spectacularly mediocre that it made actor Christoph Waltz appear like a vagabond they picked up off the streets of Hollywood. Another unique quality is that in this film, Bond didn't sleep with every woman he came into contact with. In fact, the two women he did bed didn't get killed. What were they thinking?! Unlike other Bond films, they didn't thread the Bond theme throughout the overwrought and pedestrian Thomas Newman soundtrack. Other than those few surprises, it was a paint-by-numbers Bond film, unlike the unnecessarily unique and entertaining Skyfall. It was so predictable that as I watched, I wrote down what would happen, and it did. I could have written that script in my sleep. Here's how it would go: James Bond is in (name of exotic place) and without permission from M, foils a plot to blow something up, chases a villain, and prevails. Then James goes to (another exotic place) after being told by M not to, and meets up with previous member of super villain group, and they agree to disagree. Then James meets with hot relative of said villain, and things go swimmingly, but this time, it's different: she's blond. Then James goes to another exotic place and sees a bunch of villains, finally meets #1 one villain and escapes. Then we learn the evil world dooming plot of the super villain, Bond is captured, escapes and things blow up. The End. It looked good, the sets and suits, and that's about it. Too bad Craig, who apparently was in his last Bond film, went out on such a low. Rating: Rent it. There is no reason to see it on the big screen. Rent it just to feel nostalgia for Skyfall.

","Mad Max: Fury RoadTo quote Joe Bob Briggs, the world's most famous drive-in movie critic, 'There's no plot to get in the way of the story.'Mad Max: Fury Road (MMFR) is set in a dystopian future where warlords rule and fight over oil and water in a desolate, desert land outside any rule of law. That would NEVER happen. It's the stupidest movie I have enjoyed in a long time. The sets aren't wonderful. And the acting what acting? The editing? Meh. The cinematography is okay, not spectacular for a dystopian road movie. The make up? Nope, not great. What works in the film is the action and morality tale. And the vehicles, the vehicles are COOL! (i.e. fascinating) I'm not a gearhead by any stretch, but what they did to mix different vehicles together to make scary road war machines was very successful. Like the horrendous (there are no words to describe how bad) Mad Max Beyond Thunder Dome (1985), MMFR is a morality tale not about saving Max but about saving the innocent. However, the writers were smart this time, giving Max few lines and making the female protagonist, Imperator Furiosa, the star. If there was an Oscar category for best stunt work, MMFR would win hands down. It's fun to watch while incredibly improbable. However, because it is set in its own world, we accept that. Furthermore, there are no posturing heroes spouting diatribes from patriotic speeches (Avengers) or camp and cute but deadly, sorts of heroes (Guardians of the Galaxy) or a vomit inducing good versus evil dualism that pervade so many super hero and other action films. While violent and full of explosions, it doesn't insult us with such morality play nonsense. MMFR is pure action; take it for leave it. Rating: Matinée/Full PriceIf action without pretense is your cup of tea, if you are sick of the simplistic good versus evil plots, if you like characters that don't easily fit into a box called 'villain' or 'hero', than you will enjoy MMFR. If you need those things or you want more plot or thought, I understand. I would recommend you stay home and watch the also entertaining 'Theory of Everything.' But you'll miss some bad ass vehicles Peace, Tex Shelters",7,2,9,4 June 2015
Macbeth," The Madness of King 'Macbeth'
","From the beginning, Captain Macbeth and kinsman to the King is cursed with the witches' prophesy telling him that he will be King. How is that for a dramatic foreshadowing? And it is a curse. His desire to be King, a test of his prowess, will make and undo him. Why does Macbeth want the Scottish crown that wears so heavy? Why does Lady Macbeth lust after it so? What is the benefit of being queen? Is it just so, that all men lust for power and all powerful women lust for men with power? The play, and thus the film, offers little explanation. And unlike King Lear, there is no fool character to reflect the king's madness, only other lords and kinsman afflicted with a similar infliction. The acting is uneven. Fassbender does well with the material, but he doesn't live up to expectations. Cotillard as Lady Macbeth fails to impress. She does little to convince us that she is pulling Macbeth's strings and when Macbeth does his worst deeds, her madness and guilt over those actions misses the mark. What she expresses is a weak sadness, not the guilt and shock of an accomplice. Whether it is is the direction or the acting, Lady Macbeth often didn't strike true. In Kurosawa's version of Macbeth, 'Throne of Blood', Lady Macbeth is a clearly conniving, manipulative terror. In this version, not so much. I like the more diabolical Lady and the more clearly falsely grieving version of the Kurosawa adaptation. And I understand how extremely unfair it is to compare anything to the master of cinema, Kurosawa. Macbeth was played only slightly better. Fassbender is unable to really honor and show the true bloodthirsty nature of character. He holds back, seeming to think that by holding back on his psychopathology, that it shows a complex character. It doesn't. It shows an unwillingness to commit. In the scene where he grieves his choices, he is much more powerful. Sean Harris, on the other hand, plays the complex Macduff to its fullest. Harris shows incredulity at the actions of King Macbeth, a confused anguish over the king's vengeance, while at the same time demonstrates a hatred and purpose. On hearing of his lost family, Macduff states that he will ' dispute it as a man' but he will also 'feel it like a man.' And Harris/Macduff does just that. His recognition of his fate is the most powerful scene in the film. I like the way the film treats the witches as spirits as not as demonic as in other portrayals. That leaves room for the real manipulators of Macbeth, his wife and his unconscious and barely subsumed desire for absolute power, to come to the fore. His lust for power is barely hidden under a shroud of honor and love, and it only takes the lust of his future queen to bring it out. At its best, 'Macbeth' is a tale of honor, country, family and megalomania. At its worst, the film is a confused jumble of motivations that are seldom clear, except in the case of Macduff. It didn't help that director Kurzel couldn't decide whether this version of the play should be more cinematic or theatrical, using elements of both and not always successfully. The best moments are on the moor, though one would assume the play favored the bedroom scenes between Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. Their chemistry was fine, but Cotillard in no way convinces us that she could manipulate Fassbender to do anything but bed her. Aye, there's the the rub. My mind is too modern to accept such simplistic motivations, and it will take more than reading words on a page to get me to accept the premise. Rating: MatinéeIt looks great in the Scottish and Northern English countryside. The sets and costumes are well done and even the Scottish warpaint, often a distraction in other films of Scottish warfare, is both powerful and subtle. The film is visually appealing, and despite its uneven performances, there is enough worth watching on the big screen. Peace, Tex Shelters",6,2,2,13 December 2015
