Whip It," Jammin'!
","Well, my 9 year old daughter is starting to play roller derby, so naturally, I had to watch this! And I'm glad I did! Great cast and fun roller derby scenes! The romance sub-plot was a total dud for me, as was having an 'evil' derby nemesis, but the rest was a fun watch! Page, Wiig, Bell, and Shawkat were excellent, and Harden is always great in that hard-mom role! Side note on her, when she's on screen in her USPS shirt, she totally looks like one of my former letter carrier co-workers! Dead on! If my daughter is still into roller derby in a few, 5 ish, years, I'll definitely watch this with her. Go Hurl Scouts!!!",7,2,4,2 May 2017
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Greatest film of all time!!!!
","My favorite movie of all time!!! From the first time I saw it in theaters in 1981, to last night, again in a theater, this movie blows me away! Love it, love it, love it!!!!",10,1,2,20 June 2019
It," Who done IT?
","The clown. The red balloon. The sewers. All horrible! The book scared me, the mini-series scared me, and this scared me! But with Pennywise, an evil, killer clown, how couldn't you be scared? Even knowing what was going to happen, the first 10 minutes still freaked me out! As a fan of the novel, I found it interesting that only the kids story was told in this movie, and I'm assuming the adult story will be in part 2. I don't know if I'm a fan of this division, but this movie still worked on it's own. I'm definitely on board for the next one! p.s. - not to be mean, but I think Tim Curry was the better Pennywise!",8,0,0,17 January 2018
Hereditary," 'I really don't know clouds at all'
","I'm not really sure how I feel about this movie. It started strong, a good psychological thriller with a decent amount of scary stuff to keep me tense. And Toni Collette was awesome! And the gal that played Charlie was super creepy - especially the 'popping' that was put to great use throughout! But the last half hour or so just rev up into a bunch of scenes that don't really make sense and conclude with a dud of an ending. I sort of felt like 'what the heck just happened?' at the end. But then, a nice touch - Judy Collins singing over the end credits. So... I'm not really sure what I just saw...",6,1,3,28 September 2018
Wind River," Amazing movie!
","She ran six miles... This is an amazing film! Full of great performances, beautiful settings, and terrible consequences. The strong emotions herein really pulled at my gut and filled me with anger, love, and sadness. I don't know if there is any way that this movie could be better. Top notch movie making at its finest! And those last two sentences on the screen... a double punch to the gut...",10,1,4,27 November 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Better than expected!
","I thought that was a 3 star movie all the way until the end! And then I loved the ending! And the way it connects right into 'A New Hope'! I also really enjoyed all the cameos from characters in the original 3 - none more so than Walrus Man and his pal! Of the new characters, I liked the duo of Baze Malbus and Chirrut Îmwe quite a lot! I don't know if this was a movie that really had to be made, but that ending... woo hoo!",8,3,6,16 April 2017
Rocky V," Paulie sucks... still!
","Well, it's the worst of the five, but I still liked it! Especially the nostalgic parts in the first half hour, and the photo montage during the ending credits. I also liked that it picked up right after the fight in number four. The movie plot isn't very good, and neither is the acting - by anyone. And, I'm sorry, but the fact that Rocky keeps Paulie around after all the trouble he's caused is not believable. Heck, he should have popped him in the first film!
Still, this film might have the best line in the series:
'No, guys; ain't no pie eating contest.'",5,0,3,12 January 2019
Hostel," Of course, my horse!
","This movie is soooo gross! The eye scene? Puke rising up to my mouth just thinking about it! Blech!!! So much excessive horror nastiness! Sick as heck, but just hard not to watch! Throw in the gorgeous women, and you've got a disgustingly beautiful horror flick!I loved the Oli character - the king of swing - 'Of course my horse'! And the gang of young boys that want gum! So weird! I also liked the whole Europeaness of the film - the location, language, and overall feel of it! Lent a big piece of realism to it all.My negative rant is that I wanted to know more about the town, and the people, and the 'why' of it all. I know money is part/most of it. But I wanted to know why.",8,13,15,2 September 2019
Us," What are Micro Machines?
","Jordan Peele is now 2 for 2! Good, creepy flick! And really good acting! Especially when they are playing their others! Soooo creepy! Lupita Nyong'o is really good, and Shahadi Wright Joseph is a close second! And I liked how goofy the dad is - at the beginning! I'll say this - I was in Santa Cruz about 5 weeks ago, and I'm super glad that I hadn't seen this movie yet! Now, I'm not sure if I wanna go back...I remember seeing the trailer for this movie after the Super Bowl, and the creepy way that the song 'I've Got 5 On It' was used. I really thought it looked good. And it really is! Keep 'em coming Mr. Peele!",9,2,7,20 June 2019
Knives Out," Fun, interesting, star studded movie!
","Fun, interesting, star studded movie! Even Daniel Craig's Foghorn Leghorn accent worked in this! The whole cast really shines in this, and I especially enjoyed Toni Collette's new age, dippy character! Good plot, good who-done-it, and really cool setting! And Ana de Armas, who plays Marta, really carries her character well! If you like murder mysteries, with the detective unveiling the whole plot at the end (a la Agatha Christie novels), then this is your kind of flick! Just please, after you watch it, please explain the doughnut comparisons!?!",9,0,1,26 April 2020
The Irishman," The film is better than the book!
","Excellent movie with amazing talent! And De Niro and Pesci are calm throughout!?!? Pacino, not so much. I could have used more Keitel, but that's splitting hairs a bit. Love the way Scorsese makes a movie, and as per usual, the music plays a big part! I could swear I heard 'The Godfather Theme' in here, and maybe some bit of score from 'The Untouchables'? I also liked the whole story with Hoffa, the Kennedys, Cuba, and all of the other real life events that weaved in and out of the plot. What kept me from giving this 5 stars is that it really peters out at the end, stretching much too long into Frank's declining health. And the whole thing with Peggy seemed purposeless, and overwrought, and really, had little, if nothing, to do with the overall plot.",8,1,3,6 January 2020
Creed," Good riddance Paulie!!!!
","Good movie, and good choice of direction for the Rocky series! Even though it is 'Creed', it did a really good job picking up after the last 'Rocky' movie and keeping the continuity, flow, and history! I gotta admit, about the 1 1/2 hour mark, I could feel the ol' Rocky magic pumping me up! And at about the two hour mark I was misting up! I didn't really like the love story aspect, or her music, but the rest of the film hit (pun intended!) all the right notes for me! Stallone is pretty good as 'unc' Rocky, and Phylicia Rashad really owned the screen for the brief moments she was on it! The part where she says that she was the one to wipe Apollo's ass when he couldn't was pretty real, and strong!And, I know this will come off jerky, but I was so glad not to see Paulie! I really hated that character! So long ya' jerk!",8,0,2,19 February 2019
The Others," Screw that!
","I'm not sure what happened and why, but I do know that this movie is scary as hell!!!
The children are great actors, and Nicole Kidman and Fionnula-Flanagan are pretty dang good too! The whole thing was just freaky! It's a haunted house tale for sure, but with enough twists, what-was-that's, and jumps-outta-your-seats to be pretty original in, and of, itself. I definitely now understand why it is on so many must see scary movie lists... it's scary!!!p.s. - I will never, ever, ever walk into a room where everything is covered in white sheets! SCREW THAT!",8,3,3,23 February 2019
Deadpool 2," Whoa, Domino!
","A decent enough follow up, with quite a few chuckles! I especially liked the additions of Josh Brolin and Zazie Beetz! Yet, I still don't like the existence of Colossus and Teenage Mega Sonic whatever. And I really didn't like the character of Firefist. T.J. Miller is still hilarious, as is Leslie Uggams and the music is great, even the dub step! Totally worth the watch! If you liked the first one, you'll like this one! Especially Peter!",7,0,0,8 October 2018
The Hateful Eight," Love All Eight!
","I've really grow into liking/loving this movie! The acting is great - Kurt Russell, Samuel L. Jackson, and a tour de force by Jennifer Jason Leigh! (that last one could be a crazy/killer type person from here on out! Or how about Janis Joplin?) And the subjects are super engaging - racism, post Civil War U.S.A., and the wild, wild west! This movie is long, but I'm not sure what I'd cut, I just know how I felt in the theatre - I'm digging it, but I need an intermission type break! Oh, and for the faint of heart, there is some super nasty/bloody stuff in here! I've watched this again and again, and I've not tired of it yet!",9,0,2,23 March 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Read the book first!
","To begin, the book, as almost always, is better than the film. This review is for the movie, which I am considering ends at the cross burning. The footage at the end is amazing, powerful, and indicting, but not part of the movie proper, in my opinion. To which -The movie is ok. It doesn't really deal with the actual plot of the title until about a half an hour in, which didn't really make sense to me. The speech at the beginning is awesome, but has very little to do with Stallworth's overall investigation. And with all the new pieces the filmmaker added to the plot, the actual investigation itself seems watered down in here. Even the great scene with Harry Belafonte juxtaposed with the KKK ceremony feels like a separate event than the investigation. The movie just stops to let these amazing speeches occur, and I wish they had their own, separate, spotlight. In my opinion.
Just like the ending news footage. Watching the real David Duke, the horrible Donald Trump, and the footage from Charlottesville slam home that the KKK and their kind are still here, and very much alive! I cried at the end. It just felt that though it all is connected by the same message, it wasn't part of the movie. Just my opinion.
Also kudos to Mr. Lee for NOT being in the film. He is such a bad actor, and I'm glad he was able to stay out of this one. Conversely, shame on him for using that horrible film technique of his, where the character(s) seem to be on a dolly and moving forward in a type of slow motion. It still sucks, no matter how many years he's used it.",7,2,5,7 January 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Wow!
","Frances McDormand is absolutely amazing in her role! As tough as she plays it, she should have been the lead in the reboot of 'Death Wish'! She rules! This is a gut punch of a movie, well acted, well written, and a beauty to watch. The ending was totally unexpected for me! Shockingly so! Should have won Best Picture for sure!",9,1,4,12 March 2018
The Grapes of Wrath," California here we come!
","This is a beautiful looking film with lots of wonderful acting performances! It's one of the rare times that a classic book has been turned into a classic movie, in my opinion! John Ford really captures the essence of the novel, even if some big parts are left out. And when Henry Fonda delivers that 'I'll be there' speech near the end, well that's just cinema gold! It's not better than the book, but it sure can stand proud!",10,2,2,24 July 2017
Bird Box," Boy! Girl! Listen to the birds!
","Well, I'm a sucker for end-of-the-world flicks, and this one delivers! In 'A Quiet Place', of recent release one couldn't make a sound. In this movie, one cannot look outside! So lots of dark rooms, pulled shades and curtains, and blindfolds! I thought Sandra Bullock was great in her role, and I really enjoyed the performances of John Malkovich and Trevante Rhodes as well! And those kids are pretty cute too, but they did stress me out quite a bit! Like I said, this is my kind of move, and I liked it!",8,1,2,24 February 2019
Baby Driver," b a n a n a s
","Pretty dang good movie! That opening car chase sequence had my blood pumping and the muscles in my hands clinched tight up! I loved the way the music and the action was synchronized - pretty slick! And the women in here were so pretty! Lily James is just so..., just so wow! Sweet and gorgeous! And Eiza González is smoking hot! I felt that the plot dragged just a little bit in the middle, but I would definitely watch this again!",8,1,3,10 November 2017
The Thing," Still scary after all these years...
","This movie scared the tar outta me when I was a young teen, and it scared the tar outta me just now! Holy crud is John Carpenter amazing! I recently read the novella that this is based on, and I tell ya' what, the movie might actually be better! That dang spider-head thing is gonna haunt me tonight, I'm sure! If I learned anything from this flick, and I did, it's that keeping dogs and Norwegians around is a bad, bad idea in the Antarctic!",8,0,1,19 June 2017
Split," Split... for the exit!
","I swore I wouldn't watch another Shyamalan movie, and I should have stuck to that. While it is indeed, a thriller, and does a nice job moving up to a big climatic moment, this movie simply doesn't deliver, and it doesn't make sense. At least M. Night didn't give us another stupid-'gotcha'-ending. He just doesn't give us any sensible, coherent ending at all. James McAvoy is pretty darn good - maybe he knows what this movie is supposed to be about! M. Night really needs to stop. And so do I.",3,8,20,19 May 2017
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," A Terminator that terminates Terminators?
","A Terminator that terminates Terminators? Say that ten times fast!
Not as good of a movie as it's two predecessors, but action packed and explosive! Biggest problem I had was that the T-X kept 'forgetting' how powerful it was! Sometimes it ran as fast as a moving car, sometimes it didn't. Sometimes it regenerated immediately, sometimes it couldn't. I think the script writers really dropped the ball on this model's abilities. And the plot suffers because of that.Cool to see Dr. Peter Silberman again! SUPER cool NOT to see that high-pitched whinny kid that played John Connor in part 2! Honestly, this film should get 10 starts for keeping that actor out of this picture! And the casting people should all get bonuses! That kid was horrible.",7,0,0,6 July 2020
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Nicholas Cage is in the movie, and he doesn't ruin it? WAAAAAA?
","Lots of positives in this - attention to detail, the six (well, 5 for me) alternate Spideys, and the quality of the animation! Loved Spider-Gwen and Spider-Ham! And I really liked how Spider-Man Noir looked! Super cool! (plus, it was amazing that Nicolas Cage didn't ruin it! I guess NOT seeing him makes him betterish!) I liked the name Peni Parker, but I don't like anime at all, so I could have done without her completely.
Negatives - fight scenes were boringly too long! WAAAAAY too long! And everything having to do with the machine thing was boring, lame, stupid, confusing, etc. Yes, it got all those Spideys 'here', but it was a terrible plot point. And the fight at the end with the machine? It's length and pointlessness almost made me shut off the disc. Seriously, how long was it? 20 minutes? So, so bad.But if/when I re-watch this, I'll fast-forward those scenes, and probably have a 4, 4 1/2 star watch! And a much more compact movie!",7,1,1,2 September 2019
Salt," no pepper?
","I gotta say, I didn't want to like this movie... but I did! It moves at a fast pace, right from the start, and never really lets up! The plot is okay, but it is hard to believe that someone Jolie's size could beat up so many other people twice her size. Also, her leaping abilities are much too comic book-ish. But there is a bit of suspense about who she really is, and it kept me entertained for the running time, so 7 stars it is! (but I should take away one star, or more, for that actor playing the U.S. President! Was that Keanu's dad? Terrible.)",7,0,1,27 July 2018
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Nice t-shirt!
","I saw 'THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB' first, so I was expecting an action-thriller. This one is more of a detective-thriller. It's good, but a little long, and a bit confusing, especially which name went with which male Vanger. They all melded into one for me! And the end is just a thud. Lisbeth is still a cool character, and Rooney Mara plays her very well. I was also quite fond of Daniel Craig's performance. I just didn't find the 'what happened to Harriet?' storyline to be all that interesting. I think I cared more about what happened to Cat?",7,0,0,28 June 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," the first QT film I didn't like.
","Well, I have to say, I didn't like this movie, and I've pretty much loved Tarantino's films to date. Really, this didn't even feel like one of his pictures. Where was the wonderful dialogue, the banter, the witty repartee? Almost completely absent in this, except for just a little from child actor Julia Butters. A very little. DiCaprio's character is super lame, and the fact that we have to watch him act in a movie within this movie is just torture. As are the long, purposeless driving scenes. Yeah, just driving. And honestly, where the plot ends up is not a surprise, as Tarantino did the same type of thing in a previous, far superior film of his.
Bright spots are Margot Robbie, who is just amazingly gorgeous, Margaret Qualley, who just dominated her scenes, and Al Pacino, who creates a heck of character that disappointingly just disappears from the film. (actually, when he pops up in his second scene, I had completely forgot he was in the film! I guess those driving scenes had lulled me to complacency.) Oh yeah, and Bruce Dern was hilarious as George Spahn!
Overall, just totally disappointed. Had Tarantino's name not been on it, I totally would have turned this off at the 30 minute mark. He does throw in his trademark over-the-top-disgusting violence near the end, but really, this seems like a movie by someone else. And not a good someone else.",6,3,5,7 January 2020
Get Out," Get out - ta here!
","Awesome flick! Super creepy, freaky, scary, and super funny too! The plot is totally whacked out, but it works and I was as scared as I've been in 'regular' horror flicks! And Marcus Henderson steals all of his scenes and is absolutely hysterical! The other actors are top notch too, and the story is superb! And two of the songs in here are completely used to maximum freaky deaky effect! I'm definitely watching this one again!",10,10,19,22 June 2017
Aladdin," pleasant surprise!
","I'm surprised how much I enjoyed this! I really loved the original, and this one holds up pretty well! Will Smith was an excellent choice to play the genie, and while he channels Robin Williams a bit, he puts his own stamp on the role! The scenes for 'One Jump Ahead' and 'Prince Ali' were really good! And though I'm not a big fan of CGI or frantic camera angles, I didn't mind them so much in this. A pleasant surprise!",7,6,12,20 June 2019
A Quiet Place," would my CPAP be too loud?
","I was freaked out the entire running time of this movie! Well, except when they played one of my all time favorite songs in a tender moment. Other than that, edge of my seat, stressed out viewing! I would not have survived one day in this world, what with my sleep apnea, gassy discharges, and super hyper startle response! But this family - wow! And really good acting, especially Millicent Simmonds! As much as I enjoyed this film, I don't think I could survive watching it again! Fudge monkeys!",9,2,3,14 July 2018
Dog Day Afternoon," Wyoming is still not a country....
","Great film! Pacino is superb! I loved the crazy, intense arguing between Pacino and Durning! It felt so real, even adlibbed! The feel of the movie is incredibly real too - sweat robbers and hostages, dirty door window of the bank, almost everyone looking worn out and exhausted. I love when filmmakers realize that makeup and hair aren't perfect in real life! This film also touches on social issues, like gay marriage, sex change operations, working man poverty, etc. Pretty progressive! I'd definitely watch this again! ' ATTICA! ATTICA! ATTICA!'p.s. - love that 3 'Godfather' actors are in this!",9,1,2,25 August 2017
Hidden Figures," 'Every time we get a chance to get ahead they move the finish line. Every time.'
","'Every time we get a chance to get ahead they move the finish line. Every time.'A fantastic movie with amazing chemistry between the three main actresses! Touches on the sexism, racism, and deplorable civil rights conditions in the south during this time. And shows us how three strong women overcome all of that to make important contributions to the space program at NASA. The film also combines actual footage of the time to blend in to the narrative of the movie. I really enjoyed this film enormously, and was proud to have my eleven year old daughter by my side as we watched it! Such an important piece of this country's history! Everyone should watch this!",9,0,4,3 November 2019
Coco," Book of Life part 2?
","This movie is beautiful and breathtaking to watch! And the opening, with the storytelling on the flags, is almost magical! I do give the movie an eight, taking away one for the much-too-scary spirit guide and one for the super lull in the story about midway. But I'd give this movie no stars based on the fact that is seems so much like Book of Life! The similarities between the two films are too many to list! I hope Pixar/Disney gives those filmmakers half of their gross! Gee whiz! p.s. - The Frozen short before this movie was not very good. It was interesting too that the short was so 'white' compared to the film, which felt so diverse. I think they need to put the Frozen franchise out to pasture.",8,1,13,26 November 2017
Event Horizon," Eventful
","I picked this up to watch after seeing it pop up on numerous 'must watch' scary movie lists. And it is scary... but not like momentously scary. The Event Horizon is a ship that basically is a haunted house in space! And the crew sent out to rescue it has to battle those 'haunts' and try to get back alive. I think this would have been much scarier on the big screen, but I will say that the special effects sure hold up for a movie from 1997! Overall, I'm glad I watched it, but I would not give it an 'all-time' scary ranking at all.",7,1,1,5 December 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The lost Jedi...
","I'd like to preface this by stating that this is the first of the numbered SW films that I did not see in the theater. This movie starts out with a bang - an X-wing versus a New Order fleet! Awesome! And then... not much for about an hour and a half. Then it revs back up, but dang that's a long way to wait. It ends well too, and inspiring in a sense. Good movie, but not epic.Sadly, like #7, there are a lot of repeats in this film. The Snoke, Kylo, Rey scene is almost a complete copy of the Empero, Vader, Luke scene in ROTJ. And the attack on planet Hoth from TESB is replicated here, only on a salt planet, not a snow one. Well, at least there wasn't another Death Star/Planet, right? And we got Benicio! That ruled!",6,2,10,8 April 2018
The Adjustment Bureau," Adjusted from the short story....
","Verryyyy different than the short story that it is 'based' on! I was really looking forward to see a talking dog! Actually, I think it's kind of weird that the dog's part in the story is given to an African American actor. hmmm...Great chemistry between Damon and Blunt! They seemed almost natural and real in their conversations! And she's so dang pretty! I really enjoyed the acting of John Slattery and Terrence Stamp as well! This movie, for me, turned out to be more of a romance than a sci-fi flick, but it was still a decent view. I liked the hats and especially the doors, which were super cool. But I really liked Blunt with Damon and would love to see the two of them together in another film!",6,2,2,24 July 2017
Midsommar," So we just gonna ignore the bear then?
","I must say, this is either the best movie I have ever seen, the worst movie I've ever seen, or the most bizarre movie I've ever seen! Or all three? WTF? Here's an official summary of the movie:'A couple travels to Sweden to visit a rural hometown's fabled mid-summer festival. What begins as an idyllic retreat quickly devolves into an increasingly violent and bizarre competition at the hands of a pagan cult.'I guess that is as close as I can get to describing what I just watched. The film is gorgeously filmed, great costuming, setting, colors, music, ensemble acting, etc.. Just fantastic to watch! The story is totally bizarre, and at times, I felt like it was real! The buildings, the symbols, the traditions, all of it! I felt lost within it, and sometimes, I felt like I was on some long, strange trip. Seriously! I'm just kind of blown away by what I watched, and truthfully, still not sure about it at all. Seriously trippin' balls....",10,15,24,25 November 2019
Once Upon a Time in America," Pick up the damn phone!!
","The unending ringing of the telephone at the beginning really put me off, and I never recovered. While it is a good looking film, it is also boring and drawn out. And some of the actors are just terrible.",3,7,16,20 January 2018
Selma," Thank you Dr. King!
","Amazing. Powerful. Emotional. Fantastic!
This movie made me tear up, gave me goosebumps, and angered me to no end. David Oyelowo gives the performance of a lifetime in portraying Dr. King. Everything about this movie should be cherished and shared with everyone. The courage of the men and women who are portrayed in this film is unbelievable! We are all better off because of them!",9,0,3,25 June 2019
Sicario," Del Toro is del bomb!
","In Spanish, Sicario means a hired assassin or killer. Boy does it!
Great opening! The first 7 minutes are crazy intense! Actually, the whole film is! It seems like every scene is filled with tension, stress, and danger. It's a very good movie, a deep look at the 'war on drugs' along the U.S./Mexico border. And Benicio Del Toro is just awesomely savage and amazing in his role! My only negative, is that it really reminds me of a book that I read, 'The Power of the Dog' by Don Winslow, which came out 9 years before this movie. It does not take anything away from the power of this film, I'm just saying they seem similar.",9,1,2,8 January 2018
The Witch," what the?
","Um... what?Seriously, what was that? I liked the look of the film, I liked the tension and startling music, and I thought the acting was good, especially the young man that played Caleb! But what was that story? Really? I almost fell asleep at the half hour mark, even with the loud musical score! By the horns of Black Phillip, I have not a clue as to why I watched this 'till thee end. Grr...",5,4,6,19 October 2018
Rosemary's Baby," To 1966! The year One.
","On it's own, this is a dang fine movie! But I'm even more of a fan as it stays pretty true to the novel! And the casting is almost dang near spot on! Even though it is over two hours, it seems like just the right amount of time for the story to unravel. And the way they end it seems like the right decision too! Mia Farrow is really, really good in her role, as is Ruth Gordon, who reminds me of almost all of the older, nosy women in my life! And even though it is set in 1965/66, it doesn't really seem dated, other than the phone booths and the old television clicker. Definitely a fine horror film, with a super creepy 'song' by Mia Farrow, but probably should not be shown to any pregnant women!",9,1,1,24 June 2019
Joker," should have called him the Smoker... cough, cough
","Well, I didn't like that they changed the origin story of the main character, and within that, the origin story of Batman. I liked the originals. And, for one and a half hours, this film felt like it was 'beating a dead horse' - Arthur is mentally ill, in a desperate time, with no more social services. And he's slipping into madness. Pause, repeat, repeat, for nearly 90 minutes. It's dark and traumatic, but its also boring, at that length. Phoenix does a good job of it, sort of combining Buffalo Bill from 'Silence of Lambs' with the emaciated body of Trevor Reznik from 'The Machinist', and to good effect, but no one could have kept that up in an interesting manner for that long.The last half hour is better, and lays a solid foundation for how the Joker gains power, almost despite himself. His look, and his laugh, turn more to the classic version of the character and has more of the feel of the Joker I grew up with. But, I don't know that I'd watch this again, and certainly not as often as I've re-watched 'The Dark Knight' since it came out. This almost might have been a better movie if it wasn't about the Joker at all, and just about some how some crazy man came to be and came to power. Knock, knock...",6,5,10,10 January 2020
Pitch Perfect 2," Pitch... meh...
","I didn't love the first one, and this one definitely isn't as good. The music is still the star, but I wasn't blown away until the last song. Still, Fat Amy is funny, as are the Green Bay Packers, and Keegan-Michael Key steals all of the scenes that he is in! Not 'perfect', but o.k.!",5,0,0,7 January 2018
It Chapter Two," Beep beep
","Overall, I thought this was a good movie. I liked both casts, and I really liked how they went back and forth between the two. I felt like there were a lot of strong acting points, and strong scenes in general.
Where it didn't work for me was with the CGI 'monsters'. Many of them looked silly and slightly-humorous, as opposed to scary. And for me, that took a lot of the tenseness out of those scenes. The clown all on its own is scary enough, the other stuff paled in comparison.
Again, I did enjoy this film, but I think that scary guys in costumes beat special effects creations almost every time. Still, I'm gonna stay the hell outta Derry, for sure!",7,0,0,14 December 2019
Halloween," Haddonfield sunsets...
","I just re-watched this (for the umpteenth time!) to get ready for the new one, and I must say, this still holds up extremely well! The music, the opening scene with 6 year old Michael, and the super-intense delivery that Donald Pleasence, gives to every line! Wowza! And really, it's the lighting that does it. The shadows with just hints of light make this super creepy! Man, it's a good one! And that ending, when Loomis looks down from the balcony and the music kicks right in... freakin' freaky man! The only 'flaw' I saw was how fast the sun sets as the girls drive across town. Day light to pitch black in the blink of an eye!
This go around, I noticed that one of the movies the characters are watching is 'The Thing', which Carpenter will remake three years after this. I also never noticed how many times P.J. Soles says 'totally'. Guess I was way too scared before!",8,0,0,22 October 2018
Black Panther," Oakanda forever!
","I'm not a huge comic book movie guy, so I probably enjoyed this just about as much as I could! Lots of great action, a decent plot, and some seriously kickin' acting! In fact, the Black Panther was probably my 6th or 7th favorite character, behind his sister, both bad guys, the head of the rhino tribe, the head of the gorilla tribe, and definitely way behind my super favorite - Okoye! She was amazing! Give that character her own movie please! I also enjoyed the Oakland connection! And I really enjoyed the music! In fact, after I watched this movie, I was really feeling the tunes, and I fell to sleep listening to South African musician Vusi Mahlasela's cd 'Naledi Ya Tsela (Guiding Star)'. Wakanda forever!",7,0,1,28 May 2018
Mother!," Read the book!
","I'm not sure what the trailer did to get me to watch this, but that was false advertising if there every was any! Two hours of unintelligible chaos to get to a 'deep' ending. Really? Couldn't shave an hour of non-sensical yelling and screaming and delivered the same point? All I wanted to do at the end of this mess was punch Him in the mouth!",1,9,14,6 January 2018
Pitch Perfect," Baloney Barb shoulda been in!
","The music is the whole thing with this movie! The other 'plot' parts are pretty average and cliché. But the music! Nice! Loved the a Capella, loved Beca's cup audition, and Lilly's under talking! And Riff off is the best - loved the Blackstreet! If I were to re-watch this, I'd just skip right to the tunes! But I wouldn't skip Baloney Barb for all the money in the world!",7,0,1,6 January 2018
The Matrix," Mr. Anderson...
","Just super cool, even today! Love the way both Fishburne and Weaving talk! Super cool! And the scene of Neo and Trinity in the lobby where Morpheus is being held is awesome! I'm also a big fan of the Oracle, the actress just totally owns that role! I could, and will, watch this again and again!",9,0,0,16 April 2017
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The first, the best!
",One of my all-time favorites! Just shared it with my twelve year old daughter last night! Her big question? Why didn't Chewbacca get a medal at the end? :-),10,0,0,12 April 2020
What We Do in the Shadows," Dead... but delicious!
","Pretty dang funny! Four vampires share a flat in New Zealand, and this mockumentary follows them! (Petyr was my favorite - totally old school!) The more you 'know' about vampires, the more you'll enjoy this! And there are werewolves too - Werewolves, not Swear-Wolves! This is fun and very well made! 'Dead but delicious'!",8,5,7,12 September 2017
Deadpool," What, no Clint Eastwood? No Dallas Cowboys? Oh well...
","My second favorite Wade Wilson (I'm a Cowboys fan!)! Fun movie, with lots of laughs! The opening credits are just the start! Great shots at Green Lantern! And Stan Lee as a strip club DJ? Nice! Love the roommate, the bartender, and the girlfriend! Didn't love how slow the backstory unravels, especially in the lab. Nor did I like the strange inclusion of two X-Men - the first scene we see them in really doesn't make much sense, like why on Earth did the stop him? Whatever. Good movie, good humor, and excellent music! Can't wait for #2!",8,1,3,24 March 2018
Apollo 13," Any amazing cast!
","Any amazing cast! And the special effects still hold up, in my opinion! I really enjoyed this, and loved sharing it with my twelve year old daughter, who is extremely interested in all things NASA!",8,0,0,5 July 2020
Green Book," Green - with envy!
","Great movie! I loved the two lead actors, the music, and the story! I really can't think of a thing wrong with it! Definitely one to watch, and re-watch, in the years to come!p.s. - this is the first 'Best Movie' Academy Award winner I've seen in 9 years! (since 2010 - 'The Hurt Locker'). And I totally agree!!!",9,1,4,18 March 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," even his house?
","Last time it was his dog and car, this time it's his house! Will they ever learn? Good sequel! Maybe too much action, but what the hey? I liked the expansion of the Continental world, especially the Accounts Payable ladies! I also liked that many of the supporting actors where the same! It's always better that way! I gotta say, if there's a part 3, I'm in!",7,0,1,15 June 2017
