Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Second only to Airplane! for laughs per minute
","A Clockwork Orange's Rape scene. Deliverance's sodomy. Borat's Hotel Scene.This movie is a close second to Airplane! for unreal laughs per minute. Sacha Baron Cohen is a comedic genius. Like Airplane! and Groundhound Day, Borat is as close to perfection in a movie as one gets. There is no 'I wish they would have done XYZ here.' Classic.The entire audience that I saw this with was hysterical. The 'Hotel Scene' (which necessitates a credit at the end for 'Naked Fight Coordinator') is absolutely astonishing.",9,1,7,11 November 2006
Ali," Ali - not a knockout
","As long as it was - 2 and a half hours, it still missed tons.  If you know boxing - it <i>really</i> sucks.  It leaves out much.  Never explains to viewers what the rope a dope was: against the ropes and covering up for much of the fight, Ali patiently waited while Foreman ineffectually hammered away at him.  And no one mentions later that this unreal ability to take punches may have caused his later Parkinsons to speed up.  Also - no mention of the phantom punch!  Unbelievable.",1,9,17,28 December 2001
Shaun of the Dead," Starts off great...
","but gets a bit sluggish towards the end. I have this issue with many movies - too long. Shuan starts off great. Funny stuff, good special effects - nice plot. The firs 3/4th of this film is excellent. I laughed out loud several times.But when they are baracaded in the Tavern - it is legitimately about 15-20 minutes TOO MUCH. The laughter slows to a trickle.The ending is good. So you have a great flick and a good ending sandwiching 15 minutes of blandness. Not bad for a film these days though. I give Shaun a 6. I also hope there is a sequel where they take my advice...",6,2,5,25 September 2004
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Like a beautiful widow
","Like a beautiful widow with lots to look at - but very little substance.  My biggest fear was the subtitles - could i concentrate on the film.  15 minutes in its like you know a 2nd language - they are no problem.  Problem here is the movie.  Long, drawn out scenes that have no real reason to be except to show (pick you choice) the desert, the mountains, a lake, etc etc etc.Like a remake of any of the cheesy old films - especially if you choose to watch it in English!",6,0,1,23 March 2002
A Beautiful Mind," A beautiful Farce
","This really is a great movie.  I came out of the theater with chills.  IF it were fiction - it'd be a 9 of 10.But it is not fiction.  Its a biography.  A & E's Biography is 100% better at portraying the truth than Ron Howard is.  Read Nasar's book.  It is a tough read (she's an economist) but the details are all there.  After reading the book I thought back to the movie and wondered how the heck Howard missed so much in such a long movie.I live in Princeton and have often seen John Jr. walking from the University.  I was rooting for the Oscar here until I read the book.  Based on the huge discrepancies, I hope Ron loses.Skip the film and read the truth.",Null,0,1,16 March 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Absolutely dreadful 'Back to School'
","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was special because of the Magic. Seeing Hogsworth for the first time, Harry getting out from the despair that was his Muggle life, the young wizard saving the school from Lord Voldemort.The Chamber of Secrets contains no secrets and the magic is dead.  You simply revisit Harry and his crew - you see Hogsworth for the second time, Harry is rescued from the despair that is his Muggle life and a tad older wizard saves the school from Lord Voldemort.  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is coming soon - I felt like I was sentenced early with 'Chamber'.This film is a painful 2.4 hours long.  Its the exact same film - the 3 are in trouble over and over again.  The 3 know things that they refuse to share with the school's staff.  The school's staff blames these 3 heralded students for continuous misdeeds and continuously clears them of the misdeeds as they again prove to be heros.  A scene from the book's opening is nowhere to be found - making the end wrapup somewhat hokey as well.You know about 40 minutes in that this movie is the exact same film that you saw last year with a different title.  I spent the next 2 hours fidgeting and checking my watch.  I wouldn't recommend adding this to your DVD collection when it is available.  I, for one, would rather head back to my own school in September than watch this movie ever again.  If you want to see a great back to school flick, skip this and rent....'Back to School'._GNXFAN",1,4,11,15 January 2003
The Departed," Instant Classic
","2 hours and 20 minutes feels like 20. I did not get up once. It is an instant classic not to be missed.Jack is back at his most evil best. Think Joker and Johnny combined. Instead of 'There's a bat in my belfry', you've got 'There's a rat in my crew.' Vile, evil, obnoxious and sexually excited by violence - who could ask for more in a godfather? Better than Good Fellas w/some Reservoir Dogs to end it.Leonardo, Damon and Marky Mark we're all on their games. I was even able to stomach Martin Sheen. Throw in Baldwin looking like a bigger version of Blake (Glengarry Glen Ross) (1992) and you've got a superstar cast.Not to be missed. One of my favorites...ever.",9,1,3,7 October 2006
Man on Fire," Sad, funny, violent - almost the perfect flick.
","Man on Fire is a 2+ hour joyride. It starts fast and never stops. Denzel does things you wouldn't expect from a true Hollywood 'star' - and that's what makes this film great. I couldn't help thinking that this should have been Steven Segal's movie if he hadn't let himself move into the direct to video market. Violent, kick ass, 3 word title......If Denzel makes the movie great, Dakota Fanning makes it special. Wow. A 9 year old leading Washington around in a scene. So good its scary. I hope to see more from her in the near future.Of course, mix with Christopher Walken and you've got a near perfect movie. Happy to have this as part of my DVD collection.",10,1,3,6 January 2005
