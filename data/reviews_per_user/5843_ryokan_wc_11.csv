Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Game on.
","Definitely a game worth watching.Sherlock Holmes (Robert D Jr) returns for another adventure- against his fiercest and in par nemesis, Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris), with his loyal sidekick, Dr Watson (Jude Law). In the collision between two great minds, there are possibilities of collateral damages, and this itself makes the movie more thrilling on top of its crime busting, mystery solving forte.The movie begins rather choppy but when it reaches the high gear, it is exhilarating. There are many scenes which pulled me to the edge of my seat. The train action scene is one to be reckoned with- i suppose train scenes are now favourites for high octane acts. While Watson heads to his honeymoon, little did he know he had fallen into a trap set by Prof Moriarty. Fortunately for him, Holmes followed him, in disguise- and you will laugh here, to rescue him and his newly-wed wife. Another scene that wow-ed me is when Holmes and his team are escaping through the forest. This movie absolutely has pitch perfect timing, especially for its slow-mo added with incredible sound effect. You can see the bullets flying across the screen, the men running and chasing. Lots of gunshots, lots of explosions.With Robert D Jr playing Holmes, there are hilarious scenes- right until the last moment, he will tickle your heart with his creativity and perfect use of punctuation. It is nice to see when the bromance magic between Holmes and Watson returns in the second half of the movie, after his wife is thrown overboard to safer grounds. Knowing how strong a team they are together, Holmes and Watson complements each other, and watching them tells the importance of understand others' brilliance, skills and talents like in the movie: Watson's medical viewpoints, and Holmes' time management and peculiar behaviour.Whether you need to think in this movie, i can tell you it is not as much as a thinking game like Inception. The plot is masterfully crafted, straight-forward paced that is enough to keep you engaged from start to finish.",7,0,0,2 March 2012
Skyfall," A great Bond-ing
","To say the least, this latest movie of the Bond franchise lives up to its expectation- Skyfall!I have to admit, i'm not much of a Bond fan, or even Daniel Craig. But my perspective of him has now changed, and this movie is pretty awesome. The trailer looked promising and the reviews were great- how was i to resist this? So i entered the cinema, expecting a two-and-a-half hour movie that is filled with high-pumping adrenalin scenes, girls, cars and a mission we all know, in the end, he will succeed. There was more depth and substance in this installment, to which i think, brings James Bond to a whole new level.There was no slowing down, not especially in the opening scene. The car- bike chase, especially on the rooftop, and on the train scenes were intense and definitely, they set a tone for the rest of the movie. Then, we were serenaded by Adele performing her opening credit single 'Skyfall'- like all other Bond movies where the opening credit takes about 3 to 4 minutes. The main essence of this movie relates to M and her past, which comes back to haunt her- and all those standing between them will suffer. James Bond, who returns after a 'hiatus' from the agency, has his loyalty for M tested when he meets the villain, Silva.Somehow, Silva reminds me of the Joker and Bane from The Dark Knight saga. I had this odd feeling like he would play into Bond's mind and cause mayhem. One of the best scenes in this movie was when Silva broke out from his prison and sought for revenge at M in a council hearing. The script written for M and the timing of the movie was executed perfectly, with the right dose of soundtrack to keep suspense flying high. In an attempt to be ahead of the villain, Bond devised a plan with the help of his trusted team, Q, Tanner and later Mallory. He returned to where he began- Skyfall, Scotland, and i thought Skyfall is some metaphor for something, probably a departure.The way Bond and his limited resources built a defense 'fortress' reminds me of Home Alone, but with much more violence. The climax was brilliantly done- right timing, right length of time, right amount of explosions and shootings, and right lighting. The ending was a little less expected- or i had not seen it coming, but it was a good ending to the movie.There was not much 'girl' scenes to woo over- M was the leading lady and Severine was temporary eye candy, and not much 'cars' to envy. Perhaps, more gadgetry in this. Needless to say, the action was top-notch, the acting was great. Some scenes can make you burst into laughter. I got to learn more about James Bond and M.Skyfall is definitely worth the money and time. Whether it is the best Bond movie yet, some may say, but i can't because i have not watched the older ones. But it is one of the best of this year's competitive movie list.",8,4,12,3 November 2012
The Adventures of Tintin," As its title suggests: Adventure!
","As the title suggests, i was prepared to join Tintin in a ride of adventure.Voiced by Jamie Bell as Tintin, he bought a model ship which hid clues that ultimately forced him into a feud between two families (Haddock voiced by Andy S and Sakharine voiced by Daniel C) in search for the hidden treasure. Tintin with his adorable pet Snowy, investigated the mystery surrounding them, deciphering the clues along the way and met Haddock after his kidnap by Sakharine. They escaped and raced against time and Sakharine to retrieve all three pieces of the puzzle. In the start, it felt like an animated Sherlock Holmes with Snowy playing Watson. When they boarded the ship, it felt like Narnia 3: Voyage of the Dawn Treader and when Haddock recalled the story his grandfather told him, the scenes pictured that of Pirates of the Caribbean. Not that it wasn't good or original, but just that the scenes felt familiar.I thoroughly enjoyed the graphic and visual of the movie. The faces of the characters looked so real i had to remind myself that it was an animation. One of my favourite scenes in the movie was when Tintin and his gang were in Morocco and they were running away, at the same time snatching the scrolls, from Sakharine's men and bird. It flowed well with fast-paced action and humour. Another scene that captured my attention was the fight between Haddock and Sakharine using cranes. It was intense yet entertaining to watch.How could an animation movie like this go wrong? It doesn't. It is a progressive story with mystery intertwined that blends well action with adventure, humour with intensity. Good visual and adorable characters. I was dumbfounded that Tintin was not a kid and what i thought to be a childish movie had the characters holding guns. I was wrong, but i was, to say the least, pleased. The adventures of Tintin gets a green light!",7,0,2,16 November 2011
Captain America: The First Avenger," Entertaining to its core! Way to go!
","One of the reasons i went into the cinema to watch Captain America is that i wanted to watch the last hero that completes the run of The Avengers next year. I came out the cinema more than pleased.To begin with, i thought Chris Evans perfected the role of J Storm/Human Torch in the Fantastic Four, leaving him to be named after that character as he played it well. I thought he fitted the character. But i was certainly wrong- because he was the more Captain America material. He portrays a character, very convincingly, of a warm, courageous man with a big heart that is worth idolizing as a hero. Steve Roger/Captain America is a man that values friendship and though he may be lost in the love world, that doesn't make him a man without feeling. One scene in particular that showed his bravery was the fake grenade, where he held it to himself in an attempt to save from explosion. Besides, Chris Evans managed to capture my attention, unlike Ryan R in Green Lantern, with his comical scenes. It has been a while i last laughed this loud- and the entire cinema too, watching Captain America. If Chris Evans comes to mind, it's Captain America he made proud of!Watching the trailers, i didn't expect much. And i thought all i was brought into was an action, Marvel movie. It was more to that. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It has the ideal blend of comedy, action and heart, a combination i find difficult to bring out for its true essence. The movie was fresh, original to a certain extend that what i thought wasn't what i watched. In every typical hero movie, the hero saves the civilian and in here, when he was chasing after the villain and a child was thrown into the river, i thought 'He will go save the kid, and the villain runs away'. But like i said, this is not the ordinary movie, the following scene was truly unpredictable and hilarious. In another scene, where he kisses his love, i least expected the line by Colonel Phillips (by Tommy Lee Jones). The cinema rocked with laughter!The acting by its cast are surely to be credits and the scripts written are worth quoting. Unlike in Transformers when the joke is made in passing, i was entertained in this. I was absorbed into the movie, feeling my character as Steve Roger, or his buddy, or anybody. While i enjoyed Captain America's side of the story, i don't really feel the bad-ness in the villain. In that part, it was average. I thought the villain could be developed further, making him more evil. If there is something i wanted more, it was the end. But then, it is already 2 hours- and any longer might drag the show. And as i have said, i watched what i least expected. I thought it will end with Peggy Carter (by Hayley Atwell) at the bar, dressed to kill, waiting for Steve Roger in his top suit.Then, this is the final build up to The Avengers.No doubt, Marvel skyrocketed another comic-movie adaptation on screen. With the right cast- Chris Evans and the others, and heartfelt moments with sprinkles of unpredictable comical scenes, Captain America proves to deliver far beyond expectation. I never thought i would be talking much on Captain America, but here i am with a full-fledged review on its successful impact on me.",9,7,15,28 July 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," The Amazing Spiderman is amazing.
","When i first saw the trailer of this movie last year, i thought- another Spiderman movie?, and again earlier this year- seriously, another Spiderman move?. In all honesty, i was not compelled to watch the movie- may be it was the trailer or that thought of how far can a Spiderman movie be different than the one produced about a decade ago? How 'amazing' can it be, as its title suggests?After going against the odds, i came out from the movie very pleased. In fact, i enjoyed the move thoroughly and felt very entertained. And i finally understood the word 'amazing' in the title- because it is really, pretty amazing!It is not one of those movies with excessive ZOMG factor, for sure. The movie is amazingly captured with great use of CGI. The first half of the movie explores the dark side of Peter Parker's family history in a fairly comical manner. I got to know about Peter's father, which was not much explained in the previous trilogy and i don't exactly read the comics.Then there is his high school stories of his love. The next half of the movie was gripping and fast-paced, with well angled shots to make you feel like swinging from building to building and climbing up towers- i watched it in 2D and i could still feel the height! This part of the movie focuses on the transformation of Dr Connors as the Lizard, the villain of this movie, who happens to be Peter's father's working partner. His wish to regenerate his arm goes awry, leading him to produce a biological threat that forces Spiderman to a race to save the people in the city.As i said, i was entertained. The movie was light hearted, like watching The Captain America, with brilliant cast. Andrew G performs magnificently as Peter Parker, to a certain extent, i felt him outshine Tobey M. He fits the character well. I enjoyed the scene where he first discovers of his special ability, particularly with the flipping of his skateboard. Much credits to Emma Stone, Sally Field, Martin Sheen and Rhys I, and director Marc Webb for taking the risk of rebooting this franchise. Watch out for Stan Lee in a show-stopper scene. Flash, played by Chris, gives me the feeling of a sequel where he will be featured in a bigger role- like Jacob in Twilight.Give this Spiderman a try. For a two-hour movie, this movie does not fall short and does not feel long. And a sequel is pretty likely- stay for the post-credit (duh! almost all Marvel movies has this).I have to say this one more time: The Amazing Spiderman is amazing.",8,33,47,13 July 2012
Enchanted," A well done fairy tale
","The first time i watched this movie, i did not enjoy it. The reason: bad quality (hence poor movie experience). I heard it was good but because of my mistake, i did not like it as much as the others did. That was then. Until the television showed this movie recently, i was all in to watch it again, in better quality, and i smiled after watching. Lesson learned.The movie begins with Prince Edward meeting Giselle in a fantasy world, Andalasia, and proposes to marry her. However, his evil stepmother tricked Giselle- as she does not want Prince Edward to marry Giselle and take her throne, into a well which connects to our world, in New York. Unlike her fantasy world, Giselle tries to find her way back to Andalasia to return to the arms of her, then, true love. She meets Robert and soon learns the real meaning of love. In a 'boom' ending, since this is a fairy tale, expect an all's well closure.The cast of the movie is great. Amy Adams has the ideal princess look. The development of the story is well- intertwined with comedy and music. The score and soundtrack is good listen too. The costume is stunning- especially Giselle's. In short, nothing could go wrong with this movie if one looks for an escape into a true fairy tale type story- and if you believe in happy endings!",7,3,3,2 November 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Apes stole the show...
","First and foremost, apes are not monkeys; apes are apes, the animal which manages to be the main character of the show. No doubt, what sells this movie is the ape itself, behind their story of evolution because of man. Caesar, the lead ape, is the baby of the product of an experimenting chimpanzee. Caesar grows attached to the human world, becoming foreign to its own, with intelligence that is beyond ordinary that will later lead in a rise of the apes. This movie depicts a drama that is beautifully crafted to show the relationship between man and ape, giving its 'wow' moments in bits and pieces until the credits, or post-credits.Definitely a prequel to the other 'Apes' movie, this movie explains and exudes the beginning of the whole story with simplicity that binds me from the start to the end. James Franco's performance as the leading man (Will Rodman) is one to be praised aside from the apes. He has proved again that he is an exceptional actor. Likewise, John Lithgow (Will's sick father who finds temporary relief using an experimenting virus), Tom Felton (Dodge Landon, another villain role that deserves for what he did) and David Oyelowo (Steven Jacobs, the stubborn man that seeks money out of experiments) portray their characters well. However, there wasn't much screen time of Freida Pinto given the hype created around her. His and her love story is not much presented; but then, why the need for their love story when the focus on the ape and Will far surpass the need for it? And in the short time of appearance, I believe this isn't her best performance yet.Once again, I would like to mention that this movie is drama at its best, in which there are some scenes that touch the heart. I predicted some of this sort, knowing it has a human-animal relationship. I was not disappointed; in fact, I enjoyed that it wasn't tear-jerking but suffice to pull heartstrings. Growing a connection with Caesar, we must realize that some things in life are best left unchanged- this is told in much depth. I thought there would be war between ape and man at its climax, somehow like the previous ones, but I was fooled. Because there wasn't any war; in fact, there isn't a need for war to bring out the essence of the movie. The final lines of the movie tell it all.In short, 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' lives to its great expectation and to say that it has no 'wow' moments would be a great lie. Unlike many current movies with extensive use of bombs or gun fire, this has enough to capture the attention; but then again, why the need for extensive explosions when the stage set for the story of ape and man was delivered splendidly.",8,1,2,10 August 2011
Ice Age: Continental Drift," OK... but not the best so far.
","The trio is back with the fourth installment- or no? Ice Age 4 revisits Manny, Diego and Sid in an all new adventure with a geological flavour of event- the Continental Drift happening before their very eyes, comically caused by the ever-pursuing Scrat over the acorn. As years have passed, Peaches (Manny and Ellie's daughter mammoth) grows up into a young teen, Sid welcomes his family especially his grandma and Diego finds love in their quest. The Earth plates begin to move, resulting in the trio being separated from the rest of their community. Soon, they face pirates and must work together to survive and reunite with their loved ones. That's about it. Simple, direct and somewhat formulaic.That's what Ice Age has been doing and the third (Dawn of the Dinosaur) paid well of as it becomes my favourite of this franchise. I particularly enjoyed the first half of the movie- how the Earth or land splits and moves with the graphics a wonder to watch and the hilarious scenes like the trio going through a storm. The ending falls rather flat and short. Unlike the Dawn of the Dinosaur (yes, i'm comparing with the third but i shouldn't), i didn't get the suspense and thrill when watching the climax of events. No doubt, this movie has everything done neat and clean but i personally did not find it memorable.The characters remain an interesting herd to watch. Manny continues to be grumpy but apart from that, now he becomes a father figure. Sid's craziness and wackiness is one of the strongest points of the show, or franchise to be exact. He never stops to entertain with his awkwardness. And Diego, i guess every man would relate to him- being masculine and tough yet soft on the inside. Peaches and Louis cute friendship. Again, that's just it. I found this movie to lack characterization in the other characters. The granny introduced was a nice addition but sometimes, i find her to be a tad too annoying. The pirates were just pirates playing their roles as villains but nothing further.This movie is OK may be because i had a high expectation of this movie since the third installment. Hopefully this is not the last of the Ice Age franchise because i am not thoroughly satisfied with an ending as such. Much said, it is still a good watch for a family outing because apart from the comical scenes and adventure, Ice Age 4: Continental Drift does have some values to learn and reminds you that you have each other.",7,1,1,27 July 2012
X-Men: First Class," A real First Class movie!
","A class on its own. The 'X-Men: First Class' definitely lives up to its expectations! If you have watched the rest of the X-Men movies, this movie explains and answers questions as it tells the origin of how the two sides formed: Prof X and Magneto. One of the best in its franchise and certainly, one of the greats from Marvel.The movie begins exceptionally well by introducing Charles and Erik at an early age. Charles lives in a well-to-do family and grows up with Raven (or Mystique). He earns his Professorship and studies mutant. James McAvoy, who plays Charles Xavier, stumbles in between the brink of war initiated by Sebastian Shaw (star Kevin Bacon). Micheal Fassbender who plays Erik Lehnsherr, or better known as Magneto, grew up with vengeance and sufferings in his heart, and his ultimate goal is to kill the man who killed his mother, Shaw.Charles meets Erik in one of his attempt to kill Shaw. They soon recruit more mutants on their side, coach them on their abilities and work together to stop Shaw from starting the war between America and Russia. Erik has another extra intention though. Amazing acting from the stars brought out the best of all the characters - Emma Frost, Beast, Banshee, Havok, to name a few in the movie.The development of this movie is great- a blend of high adrenaline pumping action scenes with depth on characterisation. We follow the lives and struggles of the mutants, silently standing on their side. Hugh Jackman makes a cameo appearance for Wolverine- keep you eyes open! The effects of the movie are sufficient to blow your mind away with missiles and explosions, tornado and waves.The great thing about X-Men movies, particularly in this latest one, is that it has a solid storyline that packs a punch, relives the characters from the comic and leaves every fan with a taste for more! Spectacular! Definitely an ideal pick for the weekend ahead.",9,4,8,9 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," How every great trilogy should end... brilliant!
","The legend ends. The legend ends, magnificently. The third and final installment of the Batman franchise masterminded by Christopher Nolan lives to its expectation. Nolan needs no proving further that he has one of the best minds when it comes to directing a movie. That said, i was tricked by him, again.No worries, i won't be spoiling this movie here- because you have to watch it yourself. This movie sets of eight years after The Dark Knight ends. As Bane is villain, Bruce Wayne/Batman struggles to protect and save Gotham City from Bane as he brings unimaginable chaos, leading to a war of great magnitude- one of the best in the cinema. At nearly two hours and forty five minutes, this movie is long and lots of developments are being done throughout to rise to an amazing climax.One of the greatest assemble of cast. I always like Bale as the Batman- and i think he is one of the best among all other Batman movies. Anne H who plays Selina Kyle is a good addition to the movie and her character does push plot. M Caine and Gary O who plays Alfred and Gordon, Morgan Freeman as Dr Fox, Marion C as Miranda, Joseph GL as Blake and definitely Tom Hardy as Bane show top-notch performances. Each character, given the movie length, was well developed and explored. The score and music by Hans Zimmer, as good as always.Some scenes are mind-blowing like the collapsing of the field and the bridges. Element of suspense is surely present, keeping me on the edge of my seat. I felt the ZOMG factor at its climax. The missiles chasing after the Bat in the air, the awesome bike that can change direction so awesomely. Just how the movie fits its puzzles so perfectly is brilliant- so good that it kept me and my friends thinking even after the movie. We kept thinking on how this and how that, the twists, and the special effects of the scenes. Surely, Nolan concluded his spin of this Batman saga brilliantly.There is nothing much i would want to add because i do not want to risk spoiling this movie. The title of this movie got me to think, why 'rises'? After the movie, i got what it means. It would be better if you have watched the Batman Begins and TDK as some references were made from the earlier two installments. Nevertheless, if not, watch it and be thoroughly entertained.This TDKR has definitely put DC Comic movies back in the forefront. If the other superheroes of this DC universe is made on such level, or combined, it would certainly give Marvel a run for their money! A great cinematic experience felt and definitely a must-watch.",9,3,7,29 July 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," TRANSFORMERS forever!
","When the credits began to roll, the first word that came out my mouth was 'Damn!'. And i'll say it again- DAMN, the movie is Tomahawk spectacular!Transformers. Ever since the news of its third installment was released, i was anticipating this movie like none other. With an intensified desire to watch and an irresistible attraction to the robots in disguise, i was all willing to work deeper into my pocket to fork out the price for a 3-D ticket.The movie begins with a fictitious twist to the moon landing history- the discovery of one of the Autobots spaceships remains on the Moon. Years later, Autobots and Decepticons on Earth realize the existence of powerful Cybertronian parts in the ship and war between the two intergalactic parties starts- the final battle.The movie has a solid storyline- smart! The twists and turns in this movie keeps me on the edge of my seat. However, i have to admit that the beginning was a tad too choppy and it made the movie a little messy. It progresses at warp speed, developing the characters and story simultaneously in between scenes. Unlike Transformers 2, this movie does not start with a 'bang' at the beginning or has continuously loud action scenes at the stage of development. It takes a more subtle approach, building everything to a peak so high i have never seen in any other movie. When the twist of the plot is revealed, the movie kicks in in high gear!The real Bay prevails- the action movie maestro, and for the next hour or more, the movie blasts to the end. The struggles between the Autobots and Decepticons, and the Autobots-side human allies and the Decepticons- side human allies take over, lots of explosions, running, screaming and shooting. The effect is mind-blowing! And my eyes were locked to the screen, in awe at the transforming vehicles and true-to-life gunfire. The music comes at the right time, rushing adrenaline through my veins.Some scenes in the climax strike straight to the heart and it would be a lie if i say i had no goosebumps or chills run down my spine. At times, i was touched by the characters' words and actions. I was constantly rooting for the Autobots, cheering every time they tear a Decepticon and take its life; i felt like having a gun or bomb or anything that can shoot so that i can help those Autobots. I was deeply pulled into the movie, fitting myself in Sam's or any other soldier's shoe. I had never really felt this absorbed, this connected in the movies.The fight was one of the greatest ever, different characters- human and robots, converging paths. I can't word out how the movie manages to link the characters together with its plot. You have to see it to believe it. Kudos to Bay and his crew, Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson and the rest of the casts for a tremendous effort. Alas, I don't really like Megan Fox but her character is definitely nicer to watch than Carly Spencer, Sam's new love.As a fan of Transformers, and always will be, Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Iron Hide, Ratchet, Sideswipe to name a few, will always play a role in me. A lesson of loyalty to be learned, and to have faith in oneself teaches a lot about life itself. And a story told in such epic grandeur, my money is well worth spent and i don't mind returning to the cinema for another run of endless action scenes.Sit back and relax in its beginning and buckle up when it comes. Because when it comes, there is no stop! Transformers 3 rocks to its core and Dark of the Moon is a perfect end to this trilogy. Transformers forever, an Autobots at heart, and a ride i will never forget! Damn!",9,1,4,11 July 2011
