Requiem for a Dream," A glimpse at our fall
","Imagine seeing the life of an addict through the addicts mind many have done it but not to this downfall depth. I was more then amused with this film in fact one might say i was intreguid that the film had nothing to hide. yet if it did it would make a great sequel. I am a very pickie movie watcher and to actually have nothing bad to say about the movie is a rarity. Stand out performances by the talented cast of actors yet one seemed to shine himself above the rest. Maybe its due to his comic relief in most movies but Marlon Wayans played a part that would have given me second thoughts on the direction of his acting career. The depth of his character seemed to keep everything glued on each scene he was in, a miraculously played part that deserved recognition. Jared Leto gave a astonishing portrayal of a Love so in depth that drugs couldent stop it, yet near the end it somewhat does. The dedication of the faces the actors kept during the movie is what captured me. The editor of this film gets my highest rating in interest i was in love with the way he used the scenes with drugs and made them so mystical i would need to try them to understand the feeling. Ellen Burstyn gave her best performance ive ever scene so good that me and associates of mine felt so sorry for her within the room you could hear 'aww poor thing' she captured a part of my interest never caught before and for that main reason this film was more then good. It was societies life in its realest form believe or dont believe but its out there manifesting into our minds like a sweet song entitled'requeim for a dream.'",Null,0,0,22 June 2001
Scary Movie 2," Ha ha nada
","Funny how a true way to really waste money, Funny more like why should i laugh. Ive seen some bad comedy remakes of old movies from spyhard to mafia. I cant even state that the acting was even at the otch of O.K. in fact it seemed at times improv was used but in a unfunny manor. Me and fellow colleges waited, ready to unload with laughter yet we watched that film as though we where reading subtitles. There are some parts that do shine to the light of funny its always good Chris elliot in a movie he has that oddball outtake that make you just giggle by looking at him. I was expecting more from the wayans brothers yet the only funny thing out there mouths was when shawn wayans told his girlfriend ' baby get my vasoline wheres my vasoline'. The bird had no pressence there as if they through him in just to cut 20 minutes of the movie cause they ran out of ideas. Overall would i see it again only if someone had it on and i had nothing to do.",Null,1,1,8 August 2001
Shrek," I laughed my donkey off
","Great movie although set for a more of the mind of a young teenager rather then a kid. Yet this movie set a standard for amusing cartoonish realism. I enjoyed this movie a whole lot. The voices where superb and the characters carried there own wate through this 3d land. I enjoyed the fact that they combined all of the storybook icons in this movie. It really challenged most fairy tale cartoons due to its twist in plot sequence. Eddie murphy was perfect for the donkey his presence was so intuned to his character i could not of seen anyone else doing it. Mike Myers did a good job as shrek although i would of loved to see the late chris farley present that roll as he was suppose to. I enjoyed the theme, colors, laughter, and dialoge as if i leaded into time and became a kid again. I felt glued to my seat when the end came my collegues had insisted we should leave but i was planted and couldent move. A true epic in this new realism that maya graphics produce i give it an award winning applause and hope more of the nature of movies will be released.",Null,0,0,8 August 2001
