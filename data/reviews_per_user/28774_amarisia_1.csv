Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Less violent than vol. 1 and more 'sophisticated'
","Volume 2 is less violent and more 'sophisticated' than vol. 1. The second part reminded me something from the film 'Natural born killers' (the scenes in the desert) and something from the old TV-series 'Kung-fu' (the flash back with the Saolin priest) with David Caradine, who is good enough as 'Bill', too. Uma Thurman looks like enjoying her role and Darryl Hannah is equally good as her opponent. The dialog between Bill and the Bride at the end of the film is very clever and I believe that has a lot of suspense, explaining at the same time, everything about their previous relationship and the reasons of their violent behavior. In general, the second volume was better than the first.",8,0,1,26 April 2004
