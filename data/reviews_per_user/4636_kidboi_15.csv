United 93," Unbelievable
","That is the one word that describes the movie for me. It has been more than a week since i have seen this amazing piece of work and i am still in the power of it. Yes, it's that great.Now, for a movie to catch your attention, what does it have to do? Well, for me, it has to have character development, the movie has to introduce the main characters to me. It has to show me their habits, it has to show me what are their turn-ons or turn-offs, it has to make me believe this character is not just a card board cut-out. A documentary, on the other hand, shows everything form aside, it doesn't interfere with the conversations, there aren't any scenes that explain the character, yet you steel feel for them as they are real. United 93 has the ability, a mystical force, if you will, that makes you believe the characters are real, that makes you feel like you know them for all of your life, as if they were your friends. And United 93 does this without studying characters. It is a hybrid movie, half-motion picture, half-documentary.I think everybody would agree that it's pretty hard, or even impossible, to make a 9/11 film without touching politics, but United 93 does it. It doesn't make anybody a hero, it doesn't make anybody a fool, it is a look from aside, it makes you feel like you are one of the passengers, it's all about the moment, not about the aftermath.United 93 has been my most powerful film experience to date, not only did i cry towards the end, i was also shaking. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before during a film. This is, without doubt, one of the most powerful and important films of the 21st century, and i truly do hope people will remember it. I certainly will.10/10",10,1,3,13 September 2006
Deja Vu," Doesn't work.
","I am usually skeptical about every film Tony Scott directs these days. 'Man On Fire' gave me a terrible headache for days. 'Domino' was just garbage in every possible way. The whole post - modernist thing Scott has going on is just totally unnecessary and pretty much annoying. For the most part, 'Deja Vu' loses this and that makes it more watchable. But again, there are certain scenes where Scott just obviously can't hold back on himself. and while this film is visually enjoyable(but at times annoying), there are several problems with the story.I guess it's pretty hard to make a film about time travel, that can avoid massive plot holes, but if usually these plot holes are hard to see, than in this film, they're hard miss. 'Deja Vu' rapes every time travel film possible, breaking all the usual rules set up by them. In 'Deja Vu' it is never said that time travel is dangerous and could alter the universe. It makes time travel look like an everyday task. This pretty much destroys all the excitement that you could get from the thought of time travel. Also, throughout the movie, the viewer is assured that it is impossible to change what has already happened. And throughout the film we are proved that this is true as the pieces begin to come together. But in the end, something happens, and the ending differs, implying that there is an event that changed the outcome of the story, but it is never explained what is this event. I suppose that this is intended to be the 'divine intervention'. And that's probably the thing that doesn't work in the film. Mixing religion with time travel? I'm sorry, but that's just retarded.I probably don't recommend this film to anyone. If you really want a good time travel flick, watch 'Primer' instead.",3,1,3,7 April 2007
Casablanca," Touching, very touching
","'Casablanca' is a film every person in the world should see. Even if they're not going to like. This film is simply a must see, to say the very least. But what is it that makes 'Casablanca' a classic? One of things would be the acting, which mostly stands out by Humphrey Bogart. He plays Rick Blaine, a man who lives between two constantly opposing sides - Germans and the french. He watches them tare each other apart and he is like the battlefield. Always stomped over.Other things that make this film superb are the beautiful music, excellent story line and great portrayal of Casablanca in WWII.Yet, there are quite a few things that turn me off in this movie. Only one, actually. And that would be the cinematography. It's kind of stiff, uninteresting, lacks a touch of originality, but that is just a minor glitch. Other things of this masterpiece overwhelm it.To repeat myself again, this movie is a must see. If you can't get it on DVD, you can still catch it on TCM, together with other classic movies.10/10",10,1,3,23 August 2006
The Prestige," Were you watching closely?
","Because if you were, than this movie shouldn't have seemed that great in the end. I had high hopes for The Prestige. I thought to myself, if Nolan thinks this is important enough to be made before Batman Begins 2, than it should be good. Unfortunately, the film fails to be completely amazing as I thought it would be.Yes, the cinematography is beautiful, it throws you right in the middle of Angier and Borden's rivalry. Yes, Jackman and Bale's acting is superb and convincing. Yes, the directing is nothing short of amazing. So, in that case, what was missing? Call me crazy, but this film was predictable. If you simply pay attention to the story, you can figure out the ending 10 minutes or so before it. That's OK by, but why did they have to reveal the twist at the very end, when everyone already understands everything? Did they actually think the story was THAT complex? Because it wasn't. Nolan gives us this big, breathtaking finally, thinking that we're idiots, who can't figure out what is so painfully obvious. Well, I'm sure he doesn't really think that we are idiots, but it sure looks like it.In the way it was made, The Prestige really reminded me of Memento. Not that it's a bad thing, it's just that Memento worked on every level possible, but The Prestige just doesn't. It's like a step back from the brilliance that was Memento.Otherwise, this film was marvelous. And thankfully, I'm not someone who hates an utterly brilliant film, just because the ending was too simple. I am more interested in the process, than the result. And this film is a perfect example of when the process is more tasteful than the result.8/10",8,0,2,25 January 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," Wow, where do I even start?
","This is a film after which I simply cannot find the words to express it's brilliance. And these kinds of films are a rarity not only in the modern day film, but in the film history as such. This film proves that fairy tales are not dead, if done right. And this one is done more than right.I guess I should say that I have always loved classic fairy tales. El Laberinto Del Fauno takes the formula of the classic fairy tale, but throws in elements of many other genres, such as horror, drama and war. But at it's core, Laberinto is a fairy tale. I wouldn't suggest seeking any symbolism or super deep thought in this piece, because this film doesn't really have any of that. Or at least I didn't found any of that. Or maybe I didn't want to find that? Because, seriously, what are fairy tales made for? Challenging your imagination, exploring human emotion, finding the inner child. Fairy tales find a warm place in your heart and stay there, they don't care about your mind. Laberinto, however, progresses and shows that fairy tales have grown up and they follow the changes around them. Laberinto is a brilliant example of the evolution of a genre. It is a fairy tale for those who have grown up, who want to see the brutality and honesty of the real world, yet want the innocence of the classic fairy tale, the one that stays in your heart.Laberinto works on all levels possible. The acting, the cinematography, the story, the editing, the music, the imagination, the honesty - everything is top notch and straight up brilliant. This is an instant classic, something everyone can remember. Something everyone can keep in their hearts forever.10/10",10,2,4,25 January 2007
Nacho Libre," Quite funny
","I didn't really know what to expect from this movie. I've seen Jared Hess' previous film, 'Napoleon Dynamite' and to be honest, i didn't really like it. The whole over the top character thing just couldn't make me laugh.With this film, it's basically all the same, if not worse. But it's the talented Jack Black that saves the entire show. He basically brings comedy to a new level. His facial expressions, the body language, oh, and i'm not even talking about the Mexican accent here. Simply genius. Definitely see this movie. Even if Jack Black is the only thing that is worth seeing.7/10",7,0,0,11 October 2006
Over the Hedge," Funny and original - a nice change for Dreamworks
","Over that past few years, Dreamworks has given us surprises as well as disappointments. 'Shrek', though hilarious, is basically the 'Scary Movie' of animation, making fun of everything that is hip at the very moment. 'Shark Tale' was just simply wrong and 'Madagascar', well, it just didn't work for me. But 'Over The Hedge' does something, that previous Dreamworks features didn't do. It works with characters a little bit. This time, they really stopped, and thought about the voices. Instead of picking random stars for completely inappropriate characters, the creators of 'Over The Hedge' found actors that perfectly match their animated characters.There's a little something for everyone in 'Over The Hedge'. There's originality, there's some really sharp humor, slick animation and what is very crucial, it has heart. 'Over The Hedge' is a film not just for the kids, but for their parents too, everyone will have a laugh and no one will be disappointed (hopefully, at least).Overall, it's a fun adventure and a step forward for Dreamworks Animation.8/10",8,1,2,16 September 2006
Batman Begins," The Best Batman Film!
","At first, when i heard that there is going to be a new Batman film, i thought it would just be another cheap attempt to make some $$$. And so the days past, and i started to be more interested in the story(especially with Chris Nolan as the director). One by one, great actors started to sign on for the film(Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Micheal Cane, Gary Oldmen, Morgan Freeman) and i was all over it. My friends thought it would be really bad and even the great cast and promising trailer didn't really interest them. And then finally i saw the film..... and i was amazed! Chris Nolan has created something other than the Tim Burton Batman we saw in the 80's(and i'm not even going to mention Schumacher's '2 flops in a row' Batman). He has made Batman the way he is, dark, anti-social and filled with revenge. Batman Forever and Batman & Robin were flops because the films were too much concentrated on the villains. Batman Begins, however, was centered on Bruce Wayne becoming Batman and defeating his fears. This film is truly the best Batman film ever made, and possibly the best film of this year.",7,2,2,11 January 2006
Lawrence of Arabia," Epic.
","Yesterday I finally saw this amazing film. Long before seeing it, I was told several times that I can gain the best experience out of this film, by viewing it with the biggest screen possible. I'm sure that's probably true, but sadly I did not have the chance to do so. Instead, I watched this film on my personal computer. I do however hope, that I will have a chance to see it again, only on a much bigger screen. But I'd like to think that I got what this film was trying to achieve(and frankly, it did). And that is to be the most epic film ever made. The cinematography, the battle scenes, the music, the mood that is created by the surroundings(particularly the desert) - it all helps to create a grand epic masterpiece.The acting is mind blowing, too. Peter O'Toole's performance is convincing and it's amazing to see how the character slowly develops and becomes obsessed with the desert and in the end becomes completely lost in it's embrace. Alec Guinness' performance was also quite amazing and he acts his character out smoothly. Omar Sharif does a great work at portraying a strong character who is forced to watch his friend slowly plunge into madness.Possibly the only problem this movie has, is the length. It comes close to four hours, if I am not mistaken. But in my opinion the length is necessary. It is slow paced, but it just couldn't be any other way. It helps the film slowly develop to a very melancholic and somewhat bittersweet ending.It's a shame I didn't have the chance to see this film in the theaters, when it was originally released. See this film. It's basically the definition of epic.",9,2,5,6 April 2007
Hellboy," A Real Treat
","Now, i had my concerns with this movie. Basically, it was because Guillermo Dell Torro was directing. It's not like i don't like his films or anything like that, but 'Mimic' was average at best, in my honest opinion. My friend, however, was raving about this film. I couldn't actually understand the reasons for his thrill, because i thought this movie would also be a 'so so' flick, like 'Mimic'. After seeing the trailer, my expectations for this movie grew just a little bit, but i still had my doubts. When it came out, me and my friend went to the premiere. To be honest, this movie lived beyond my expectations. Ron Pearlman does an amazing job carrying the heavy look of Hellboy, although in some scenes he looks pretty clumsy, if you ask me. But overall, he couldn't have done it better. I'm always happy to see John Hurt in a movie, no matter what movie it is. And this one was no exception. Love his strong British accent, his solid actor play and the way he manages to it in any role given to him. But what really amazes me is Del Torro's determination to have Pearlman for the role of Hellboy. I heard the studio wanted actors like The Rock or Vin Deasel(actor?). But Del Torro remained strong with his choice. This led to decrease in the films budget - from 80 000 000$ to 60 000 000$. And Del Torro didn't even care as long as he got Mr. Pearlman for the leading role. This kind of determination is what i would like to see in every Hollywood director. And i think the budget slip didn't even effect the films quality. I don't think those 20 000 000$ would have made a difference. All in all, this is an amazing film. At least for comic book adaptation.",8,1,2,14 June 2006
Children of Men," One of 2006' best films.
","2006 has really surprised me with it's movies. I was honestly expecting the big budget action blockbusters to be the years best films, but most of them just flat out sucked. Little did i know, that it was the end of this year, that would bring on the good movies. 'Children Of Men' is one of those films.The film is set in London, 2027. Everything is completely messed up. Women are infertile, people have lost all hope of further future and in the beginning of the film, the youngest person on earth dies, leaving the world in complete desperation. But could all this be changed with a single breath of child? That is the question this movie is making. When all hope seems to be lost, can one single person make a difference? In terms of cinematography, Cuaron goes into a direction similar to that in 'Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind'. Grim tones, hand held camera. And in this case, it completely works. It blends perfectly with the chaotic look and feel of this film. The 2027 London is wonderfully done, and makes you think that actually the present day, but has these little hints that it is the future, such as holographic screens and stuff like that. The acting in the film is brilliant. Since Clive Oven is one of my favorite actors, i was very delighted to finally see him in a lead role. Julianne Moore gives a solid performance as well, but i was surprised to see Michael Cane in such an extraordinary role. Instead of playing himself, as usual, he plays this crazy hippie like old wacko, who seems to like the joke 'Pull my finger' quite a lot. The movie isn't all non-stop action, but when there is action, it's realistic and very originally made.One of the best films 2006 has to offer. Definitely a must see.10/10",10,8,15,28 October 2006
2001: A Space Odyssey," A sci-fi marvel.
","I have now seen this film for five times. I'll be honest, the first time I saw it, it didn't make much/any sense to me. It all seemed like a cold, emotionless trip into nothing. But I wanted to understand it, so a second viewing was definitely required. With every time I saw this film, I discovered new things. And this is the most amazing thing about 2001 - that besides all the straight metaphors, there are things that you can have personal interpretations on, such as the monolith.This is definitely not a film that you fall in love with instantly. Well, I'm sure someone did, but the majority probably found this film blank at the first viewing. 2001 is a film that grows on you after several viewings and makes you see that there is so much more behind the seemingly bleak images. It is an exploration on the human race and it's ability to function correctly, it is a journey behind the sane into a world beyond existence, finding answers and giving new, more important questions.Another great thing about 2001, was it's attention to the detail. It looks like Kubrick has actually been thinking about the future. And this future is one that seems so far and impossible, yet gives you the sense of reality. The special effects are also great and look even more convincing than a lot of modern day sci-fi films. An ageless science fiction picture and a complete and utter must-see.",10,1,3,25 January 2007
The Descent," A genre classic? Probably...
","I just finished watching 'The Descent' for the second time. To tell the truth, i wasn't really scared after the first viewing, can't explain why really, possibly because i was watching it with eight dollar speakers. But the second time was more effective, probably because of the sub-woofer.I was waiting to see a good horror film for a few years and then came 2006, which brought me THREE great horror films - Wolf Creek, The Hills Have Eyes Remake and now The Descent. At first, when i read about the film, i wasn't really thrilled about the premise(people go into a cave, meet monsters, monsters eat the people). It reminded me too much of 'The Cave', which was an enormous disappointment. I only decided to watch it after reading positive reviews on 'Aint It Cool News'.So, about the movie. The film opens with scenes of a few women rafting, after which one of them, Sarah goes somewhere with her husband and daughter, the later two meet tragic fate on the way. Sarah is then left with a deep trauma, and sees visions of her daughter through out the film, which plays an important part in the ending of the film. A year has passed since the tragic accident, and Sarah is now on her way to what seems to be a perfect vacation with her friends. They decide to go cave-diving and they're guide through this experience is Juno, Sarah's close friend. She tells everybody, that the cave is already discovered and everything is safe. After a small passage inside the cave collapses, lies are revealed, trust falls, one of the women, Holly, breaks her leg. But that isn't the only problem... In a tense scene, where the women argue over whether there is a way out or not, something attacks them, and all hell breaks loose..Now, to get to the action in this films, you have to wait. Through this time, you get to know every woman in the group, specially Juno, who at first seems like a very supportive friend, but in the end turns out pretty much a liar.Now, about the ending... As we all may or may not know, there are two versions of the ending to 'The Descent'. In the original ending, Sarah falls into a pile of bones, sees light, wake's up and runs to it. She gets out of the cave, drives to a highway, after which she wakes up in the cave, realizing it was a dream. She then sees her daughter once again and stay's in the cave awaiting her fate. In the alternate ending, the films ends with Sarah driving to the highway, which is a very corny ending, if you ask me. The original ending, however, is much deeper and has more meaning to it. Sarah's mind cannot take more. Her husband and daughter died in a tragic accident, and now her closest fiends have died horrifying deaths, and Sarah simply looses her mind and believes, that her daughter is really there in the cave.Overall, this is a simply amazing horror film, probably, the best of this year and it could easily become a classic of the genre. If people are ready to accept it, that is.10/10",10,11,19,22 August 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Both, best and worst of the series
","This time i was surprised with the result that WB gave me. And again, i say that i don't care how much was cut out of the original book. I am taking this as a film, not as an adaptation. Yes, this one definitely is darker and more adult, bet are they going to say that before every HP movie? Of course, but with time it will stop working, and HP will be making barely 300 000 000 dollars, because this film was already PG-13, which is pretty silly, because HP is already a kids classic, and now it is stolen by an attempt to attract more people to the theaters. I would call that a brutal attempt to make extra $$$. But, dammit, it works! Now, i will tell you why this film could disappointing for those, who also take this as a film - first of all, the acting. It's not really terrible, but it's not convincing. And how D. Radkliff got to one of the top spots of the IMDb 'Best And Worst Polls of 2005' as best actor, is beyond my understanding. It is just impossible for 16 year old to play a 14 year old! YOU CANNOT FAKE PUBIRTY!!! Radkliff should have understood it. The same goes to the other actors. And now we come to the special effects. Same old, same old, one year CGI, which will seem really crappy after a few years or so. And again, this is just an entertainment movie, that definitely overrated and taken far too seriously.",6,0,0,17 January 2006
300," Awesome, but completely over-hyped.
","I just came home from seeing this visually stunning, but somewhat flawed film. I have been hearing so much about this movie, that it pretty much made me sick. Not in any forum could I avoid the buzz about '300'. First I was hyped myself, but then people started stating that it's the best thing that they've ever seen, so I was expecting a masterpiece of modern cinema. How foolish of me. At the end of the film, I honestly wanted to scream 'That's it!?!?!'. There was one forum in particular that over-hyped the movie for me. However, I shouldn't reveal the name of this forum. Don't ask why, I have my reasons.So, about the film. While I was kind of disappointed with the film, on the way home I started remembering some scenes from it and slowly realized how awesome it actually was. It wasn't the great film I was expecting in the beginning, but overall, it's extremely entertaining, solidly acted out. It does contain numerous clichés, but then again, how could it not? I have nothing bad to say about the visual part of the film. It's just amazing to say the very least. However, I felt that the film was just lacking it's own special style. Half of the film reminded me of 'Gladiator' or 'The Lord Of The Rings'. But still, this was just a minor put off.It's also heavily annoying how people tend to rate the film for it's historical accuracy(?). This is very unnecessary as this film is pure entertainment and must be viewed as such. This is definitely one of the year's best blockbusters, probably a contender for the best visual effects Oscar. If you want amazing visuals, cool battle scenes and more amazing visuals, go see this film. If you want a historical account on the battle of Thermopylae, read a book about it and skip this film.",7,2,6,5 April 2007
