Requiem for a Dream," A stunning depiction of life.
",This movie is an example of the grim effects that drugs will have on your life and the price that you'll pay to keep up a addiction that does more harm to your life than good. If you would like to movies that show this from another point of view I would recommend Blow even though it doesn't show the depressing effects of such substances but it does show that drug dealers always have an up and a down in their lifes and that they could be on top of the world for one minute and be double crossed the next. But in this movie there is also an up and a down for these three people but the down is shown to be more graphic and depressing then in the other movie and it shows that a person will show there true face when you can't help them or when your in trouble. In this movie the lead roles are played by people that did a magnificent job and they showed the raw emotions that are displayed when you are on a binge and the effects it has on your every day life. As I try to do in all of my reviews I like to point out if this movie is appropriate for you. In this movie there is pervasive depictions of drugs use and graphic sexuality and rather strong language so if you are one of those sensitive types I highly recommend that you do not view this movie but if your not this is a very well done movie.,10,1,2,4 June 2004
Fight Club," A mind-grapping masterpiece.
","From the beginning to the end of this movie you are on the edge of your seat just waiting to see what happens next. Granted the violence was a little extreme it made its point rather well I mean fights are bloody what do you suspect but if your one of those people with a weak stomach I highly recommend that you don't see this movie because it is very intense and will probably disturb you. The nice thing about the plot is that its always messing with your head, personally I found the ending to be a little disappointing even though it makes a hell of a lot of sense I thought it could have been better. Another thing that I thought to be very intriguing about the whole thing is that the second time that you watch it it is you catch the little things that you missed the first time that you saw it and you'll like it even more and for once for the type of movie this is the ending didn't ruin the whole movie for you even though as I said before it was a little disappointing both actors I believe did a magnificent job playing those roles. If your watching it for the first time don't get mad watch it again and you'll get it.",10,0,2,3 June 2004
American History X," A uncompromised masterpiece.
","This movie is a masterpiece. From the beginning of the movie to the end you are always at the end of your seat changing your opinion of what is right and it shows both views and the danger that both can have on a society and the repercussions their are to hate. Unfortunately I can't think of a movie that relates to this one of the top of my head but even if I could none could stand up to this movie, it shows the brutality of what can happen when you let hate get a hold of your life and because I don't want to ruin the movie for you I won't tell you the end but I can tell you that if you let hate get a hold of you the angrier you get the worse your life will become if I may quote Edward Furlong, 'Hate is package and life is to short to be p***ed off all the time.' Also it shows you that there will always be people out there that will not listen to you no matter what you say or do. I personally think that this movie tells you that you should try to reach as many people as you can and to not compromise your views to try and reach someone that won't listen to you, that's there choice and there the ones that are going to have to deal with it not you. And if you know someone like that there is always time for them to redeem themselves, its never too late.",10,0,0,3 June 2004
