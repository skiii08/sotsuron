The Longest Yard," The Longest Movie
","Thats the title I would have picked. Maybe its Sandlers in ability to act or be funny(anymore) but this film is pure trash. First off how is Adam Sandler a 'cool' prisoner? As he tries to be. Eh, then the story skips a few beats and reaches the unexplainable. There at one point of a game then somewhere else for example. What could make this worse. Well Rob Schnider. Since its an Adam Sandler movie he here. I lost faith in Goldberg and Reynolds. I didn't think Reynolds could go this low for work. But, the worst thing is Chris Rock. Annoying anyone. I mean this movie sucked. I mean Sandler Sucked! If anyone out there thought this movie was either well done or funny you should really take a look in the mirror. I think this was the worst Adam Sandler movie yet. To give you an idea of how bad it was. It reminded me of a Waynes brothers movie. Truly garbage!",1,4,8,23 May 2009
The Dirty Dozen," Dreck! And an over rated movie.
","This movie starts with Marvins poor acting skill that riddle this thing and present more of an football couch. Eh, Ernests only makes this movie seem more like a game. But on top of all that they try to make Marvin immortal here. As the movie progresses it picks up charm. Almost made me get in to it. The cast of guys were great together if this was a comedy. So is it? No! But like I said it has its charismatic parts, but not enough. Then was doomed from the last hour. Oh, man it is. Cheesy!!! CORNY!!! FAKE! When they do get to they're mission you easily see who will be killed next. You see the Germans looking at them with a gun, or throw a sniper scope. What you thought would happen would, and before anyone died there were was two things. They made a college effort(Like a sports movie) and fell with out any blood or a realistic movement. A unclear shot that couldn't of hit kills a character after a corny line like 'we did it.' Not that you could see where it hit anyway. One work LAME! Oh, there was one person shot in the head. Even though that didn't seem to add up. This was directed by a child's mind. Like kids playing army man. I shot. Oh I will fall down. They smile even though they are slaughtering women, and we are to pity them getting shot? Or believe it as they chant like it was a game? Yeah I know they were mostly murderers, but still the ones that were sane smiled killing people like this. And why would any of these idiots get on a little boat to do nothing? This movie SUCKED BIG TIME> A movie for the lesser mind. I watch a lot of movies from every era. This has to be the most over rated movie I have seen yet. I like the Wild Bunch and love WW2 movies. You would think this would kind of a combo here. But this... This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. To the resent generation steer clear. This is stale, and if your going to tell me it was a big start to the action movie scene. Well thanks for all those classics from Segal, Norris, and Van Damn we could of done without. Don't for get to not watch the even worse TV sequel from 85. They mysteriously age 20yrs!!! There are so much better choices out there. Check out the Once Apon a Time in the West, Wild Bunch, the Good the Bad and the Ugly.",2,6,16,10 August 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," The best Bolly Wood film. Not that its worth talking about.
","Case and point. Bolly wood is twenty to thirty years behind Hollywood. It basically copies 80s movies/TV and poor rap/tecno. Quite frankly it sucks. So, SlumDog... Great, or another Bollywood blunder. Well this movie is done well for its back grounds. It seems to mix Forest Gump with a game show. There are small differences, but not much from a far. Except this movie has huge plot holes that everyone seems to forget. Even the professional critics. This movie is a good movie, but not a great one.The movie starts with a young Indian man being accused of cheating on Who wants to be a millionaire. So they go through how he knows the answers. This is not a spoiler, thats the movie. See my disappointment. But I was told the directing was what made it. Hmmmm. I didn't see that. Terantino in Pulp Fiction was what made it. But this is well directed. I don't care what awards it own. Titanic won before, and other big budget movies won that don't deserve a thing. So those who oppose me here, look at this. Each question was asked in chronological order to when he knew the answer. No matter what your interpretation is, thats crap. How, how does that happen? Further more his brother would help him, after all that happens. And the way it happens reminds me of a stupid 70s action movie. Not even fitting with the character. The ending seems like it couldn't happen and is unexplainable. I mean if you won would you be in a train terminal? You can't excuse these problems, and there is more. What left is the struggle of a Slumdog. I think thats why Americans like it. They can't believe that there is a place like that. So thank the directors India for making you look like a third word country who dosn't care for your people. Its ashame, because the film makers don't try to use it for this effect. They obviously wanted a more dramatic appeal. Like Hollywoods Boy N the Hood, or gangster movies. So instead of the problem at hand, the actors, producers, and directors capitalize on the very people they are portraying. This movie seems like a good movie, but when up against debate brittle. But, in reality it should be a ashamed of it self. Oh and like all Bollywood crap this movie features crappy dancing at the end. Why is there dancing in a drama like this? Could you imagine at the end of Shawshank, Freeman and Robins dancing? I think it would lose points. Under first impression you could be thinking this a decent movie, but give a chance and the crappy direction and righting gleams through.",6,2,4,22 October 2009
