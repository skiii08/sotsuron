Casablanca," hof
",I am not much for romance films but the complex plot really kept you guessing until the very end.The lighting was the most beautiful I have seen especially on Ingrid Bergman she was always a bit brighter than everyone else and this really brought out her beauty and made her seem more elegant.I really liked the first scene in Rick's the lighting and focus kept you looking around the entire room even though you know what you were suppose to be focusing on.another great feature to this film was the music it was very elegant also and just added to that feel.,8,2,4,6 April 2011
