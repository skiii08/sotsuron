First Man," A Subtle, Well Done Film
","Having seen this film twice and liked it a lot, I also can understand why it has received so many harshly negative reviews. This is a character study of a famous man. However, it also strips away much of the glamour and nostalgia with which older Americans remember the space program. It has many scenes filmed in darker colors and deliberately has a claustrophobic feel to it. The handheld camera shots annoyed many viewers, but I felt that they symbolized the haphazard way in which the space program moved forward. As a country, we spent a lot of effort to lock up a few men, send them off into space, with the goal of having a photo-op on the moon before the Soviet Union got there. It is difficult for anyone who did not grow up before the 1980's to understand how frightened we were about the Soviet's lead in space exploration and how we made everything a battle between good and evil, with the Soviets being portrayed as evil. Given the logic of the Cold War, the notion of beating the Soviets to the moon made sense. We see a little of this emerging today with the fear of China, but it is hard for someone who did not live through the 1960's to appreciate how well this film captured what likely was going on under the hood.For someone who wanted to see a real-life version of Star Wars, and wanted nonstop action, this is absolutely the wrong film to see. For someone who wanted a well-crafted study of a person who was really a pawn in the Cold War, this is a masterpiece. This is a film that bears additional viewings, becaus there were many scenes in which what was not discussed, but was in the background, whether it was the music, the staging, or the throwaway dialogue, was more important.I did not give it a '!0' rating because I felt that it could have been 10-15 minutes shorter, retained the message and feel of the film, and been even more powerful as a result.",9,1,1,10 April 2019
Spotlight," Superbly Executed Film: A New Gold Standard for Films About Investigative Journalists
","Spotlight is the best film of its kind I have ever seen. All the President's Men was the gold standard for this kind of film about investigative journalism, along with Absence of Malice, but this film was better in several respects:First, it did a superior job talking about the multiple levels at which the story could be presented by the journalists: about the victims, the priest/pedophiles, Cardinal Law, or the Catholic Church cover-up;Second, it laid out the conflict among the journalists about when to run with the story and why better than any film of its kind.Third, it presented the notion that the story could have a very different effect if it ran in one part of the paper than another. The idea that a story could be 'buried,' even though it was published, because it was presented in the Metropolitan section, instead of the front page was well presented.Fourth, the conflict among the journalists seemed real, not staged, as far as how to proceed with the story.Fifth, the reasons people chose not to cooperate were well presented. People who had genuinely positive feelings about the Catholic Church were well-rounded characters, and the tension about threatening a Catholic high school with allegations about one of its faculty members was great. Stories like this have unintended consequences, and this film did a superb job laying them out.Finally, the visuals were superb. The juxtaposition of the horrific events being presented and the ordinary working and middle class neighborhoods in which they were happening was presented without being overemphasized.All in all, a wonderful movie, which, I predict, will be a classic like All the President's Men for people who want to watch intelligent films.",10,0,1,26 June 2016
Up in the Air," A Great and Original Film
","After watching this film multiple times, I decided to write a review. It is a film that works on so many levels. George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, who has the unusual service assignment of terminating people employed by other companies. (For a long time, I thought this was a service that did not exist in the real world until I was an African safari and met two gentleman who delivered this kind of service in South Africa.)The title has a double meaning: Bingham is in the air virtually the entire year and has no significant connection to his residence. He has accumulated all his travel miles on American Airlines and he stays only in Hilton Hotels, so he has all sorts of privileges that only an elite handful of travelers ever achieve with these travel service providers. So, he is literally 'up in the air' in the course of doing his job.However, he is 'up in the air' metaphorically. He has no roots to any community. He has an affair with a fellow frequent traveler, extremely well played by Vera Farmiga. He has no long-term, serious relationship, even with his own sisters. In fact, one of the great pieces of acting comes when Clooney/Bingham has to figure out how to coax his sister's fianc√© to go through with the wedding. Clooney/Bingham finds this exceptionally difficult to do because he has never been close to having a relationship that would lead to marriage. The most interesting part of the film is the juxtaposition of Clooney/Bingham's status as a receiver of very generous 'loyalty' rewards with the role he plays in denying employees of many companies the reward for the loyalty they have shown to their organizations. He gets extra-special treatment, especially from American Airlines, but the employees who have given the best 30 years of their lives to their companies are brutally ushered out the door. To me, this is the most thought-provoking and unique part of the film. This is not a remake of a 1940's or 1950's film, or even a 1980's film, because the sophisticated rewards programs from which the Clooney/Bingham character benefits did not exist. In fact, they were just being introduced into the marketplace in the early 1980's. There are other great performances and subplots, including the mentoring relationship Clooney/Bingham has with a young professional very well played by Anna Kendrick. Jason Bateman seems quite authentic as Bingham's ultimate boss.However, the center of gravity of the film is the character George Clooney plays, as only he can play it, and the many ways in which he presents a complex, multi-dimensional portrayal of someone who is 'up in the air.'",10,3,4,6 June 2018
