Skyfall," Not posh/classy enough, bad story, not James Bond enough.
","Skyfall was terrible but a nice reboot and good door open for future Bond films. But a bad movie this time, with very little 'James Bond'ness except for the first 10 mins: ending with the explosion and last 5 min: after the villains death.The bad:Intro scene was too long and lame, not as adrenaline pumping as in CR or seducing by sexy ladies like Goldeneye or TND .Predictable plot after first 20 mins, you can already guess how it will end. Too quick development of the story, unlike CR and QOS, this didn't require much effort by Bond or the agency to achieve something, gadgets were limited.Sudden forgetting of the so called list of agents, and we don't see the end of that story.Villain's tragic story is only told but not shown. purposeless plans of the villain when he could do so by blowing the office up a little delayed without getting captured at all. The purpose of the villains capture in most movies is to benefit from it, not risking for a failure.Eve is terribly played and so terrible that i forgot halfway thru that she even exists in the film, M becomes his mum Bond crying who is supposed to be an emotionless man, mix of Bourne x MI x Home Alone. What is missing:Bond movies are supposed and expected to be very educating about different countries and cultures and British sophistications but he barely goes to any foreign country taking a private jet or boat or train where he gets attacked and has a love making and good old Scotch, a few sophisticated conversations and a smile before killing a tough guy, well thats what is an expected scene and is done in all the bond movies.Bond was too panicked at all time and too serious whereas Bond is supposed to be relaxed and cool and take it easy and smile and still be a badass, one word: Lost the charm.There was not enough class or elegance or poshness in this Bond film. It was very British tho :). But it just lost the taste of traditional James Bond films of Connery's time. Craigs films are just getting worse with every new bond films. The Good: Great acting by Craig but terrible story, and directors instructions and screenplay and terrible cheapness. Re installation of Moneypenny and male M. But God plz replace the actress for moneypenny. She is terrible. Same facial expression thruout the movie and disgusting accent.But Casino Royale was awesome. It was simple, classy, nice camera movements, conversations and dialogues and acting and showing off of brands and spy nature and awesome story including multiple villains and betrayals.",6,4,12,10 November 2012
