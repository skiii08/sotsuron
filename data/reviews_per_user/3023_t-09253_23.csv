First Man," Life or Armstrong
",This movie depicts the life of one of mankind's heroes: Neil Armstrong and his journey from joining NASA to the lunar landing.The movie also deals with his personal life and how tragedy and his work affected his family and his character.Beautifully crafted and well acted.,7,0,1,26 December 2019
Casablanca," Definitely the best movie ever...
",Timeless classic. Best damn movie ever. Everything about it is wonderful. It's artistic without being pretentious.Bravo!,10,2,2,25 October 2019
Chinatown," True noir made in the 70's
",This movie delivers a perfectly good honest noir. We see one of Nicholson's best performances and Dunaway is phenomenal as always.Clean movie.,8,0,0,15 November 2019
Gravity," Amazing film...
","I loved everything about this movie, particularly the scene where Kowalski 'returns' and has this extraordinary conversation with Ryan. The bottom line of the message is: no matter how hard and how many times life hits you, you gotta stand up and fight back.Acting was spectacular, the cinematography is excellent and the direction flawless.",9,1,1,19 October 2019
The Death of Stalin," Wonderful satire
",A great satire depicting the days after the death of Stalin and the facts that led Nikita to become the leader of the USSR.Buscemi and Isaacs delivers memorable performances.,9,2,3,8 November 2019
Darkest Hour," Delivers justice to a fundamental character.
","WWII would've ended very differently had it not been for Churchill. There's no doubt about that. Oldman portrays a man of mythical proportions and delivers an incredible performance.The movie is quite good in itself -despite some minor flaws and some artistic licenses- and truly makes justice to a titanic man.Also, I enjoyed Mendelsohn's performance as the King. Definitely this guy is an extraordinary actor.",10,0,2,25 October 2019
Passengers," Pretty good.
",I don't understand the bad criticism this movie got. The performances are amazing (JL does one of her best works) and Pratt is Pratt and excelled at it.The theme might be clichÃ© but it's a damn good one.The visuals and set decoration are stunning and very beautiful.The references to classic films like The Shining are way awesome.The final act is pretty intense and the scene with the medical pod is pretty well accomplished.I give this a 7.5/10,7,4,6,5 November 2019
Knives Out," Good, round, mystery.
",Well crafted. Good plot and sane twists.Ana De Armas is amazing at her part and it was definitely nice seeing Evans playing the bad guy after all the avengers hype.Craig is very 'Poirot-y' and not so much 'Holmes-y' but his character works just fine.,7,1,6,3 December 2019
The Irishman," A different take on the mob
","Usually, mafia movies depict violence all the way through (and a typical Italian meal and its preparation).This movie gathers three of the most prominent mafia actors of cinema history (Pacino, De Niro, Pesci) and one of the best genre directors ever.But instead of dealing with the usual violence, it shows a different aspect: love and friendship and the final days of mobster and their soldiers.A wonderful directorial effort and a definite watch.The use of the CGI De-aging software was pretty spectacular and I'm sure I'm the future it will be even better for movies to come.The final 30-45 minutes are gold.",10,4,10,6 December 2019
Ready Player One," An ode to the 80's
","This is a very great movie. The visual effects are great, the soundtrack is pretty much amazing and the 80's references work perfectly. Yes, this is not the book and the changes are obvious. The book is far better, but Spielberg worked hard to produce a fair adaptation and deliver a good movie. It's certainly funnier if you get the whole references to the 80's.",8,2,4,19 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Honest review...
","I think this movie/saga deserves two reviews:
1) As a movie maker and 2) As a Star Wars fan.As a movie maker this film gets maybe a 3, but could easily land anywhere between 2.5 and 4.5 out of 10.Why?1) Editing: lazy at best. Too many things happening way too fast.
2) Direction: below average. It seems JJ Abrahams read all the tricks in the book and used them poorly.
3) Script: not spectacular but neither a disaster. It was mediocre. However, the way they 'fixed' the storyline worked in a satisfying way.
It should be noted, I liked what Rian Johnson did on Last Jedi, but his view was different from that of Abrahams, so the latter 'fixed' the issue.
4) Dialogue: Corny in some moments but spectacular at others.
5) Cinematography: Pretty regular, nothing remarkable.
6) Acting: Driver and Ridley are spectacular. The rest of the actors performing human characters are almost forgettable.
7) VfX: pretty great but nothing new to the franchise or the genre.
8) Music: Williams closed his career in the most brilliant way possible.Now,As a Star Wars fan:1) I should begin by saying that Star Wars comprehends form episode I to episode IX -including the series Clone Wars, Rebels and Mandalorian plus the Spin-offs- so those who hate the movie because they only liked the original trilogy should immerse in the whole SW universe.
2) The way they treated Leia after Carrie Fisher's passing was pretty good, emotional and respectful (i.e. the funeral scene);
2.1) Showing the scenes where Leia trains to be a Jedi and having her light saber on the film was actually amazing! I loved that
3) I loved the way they re-introduced Lando. He's always been the king of smooth.
4) The return of Han was tearful. I loved it. The way he forgives Kylo almost brought me to tears.
5) Rey being a Palpatine was something predicted by many but handled pretty well in the movie.
6) The force ghosts speaking was an absolute joy. Hearing again Obi-Wan, Mace, Adi Galia, Yoda... wonderful.
7) The Sith temple was incredible. The whole sequence was.
8) The whole space ships battle was pretty intense but lacked emotion.
9) The kiss between Rey and Kylo was long awaited and oddly not satisfying.
10) When Chewbacca cries and mourns Leia... tearful.
11) Rey's yellow saber is fitting with her whole character.
12) I disliked the way they obliterated Anakin's final deed of bringing balance by bringing back the Emperor.
From a fanatic POV the movie gets 8 out of 10.Considering the two",8,0,8,20 December 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Extraordinary
","Visually stunning.
Flawless in terms of narration.
Purveys a strong, powerful message.I loved noir spider-man (voiced by Cage) and loved how strong and determined spider-gwen was portrayed.10/10",10,1,1,4 November 2019
Spider-Man," Stands the test of time...
",I remember watching this movie in theatres many years ago and I remember that I was mesmerized.The movie itself is pretty good and as a comic adaptation it's pretty decent.Nowadays we have the MCU spider man and Andrew Garfield's reboot but this movie still stands the test of time.,6,0,1,1 December 2019
Now You See Me," Fresh, intelligent and interesting
",I enjoyed thoroughly this movie. I'm a big fan of Ruffalo and he played his character pretty well.The general idea of the movie is interesting and fresh; plus the general use of magic in the movie was pretty spot-on.,8,0,0,2 April 2020
Yesterday," Better if you love The Beatles.
","The movie is good. The premise is pretty entertaining and the acting is good. If you loved The Beatles, this movie will feel 1000 times better.",7,0,0,2 January 2020
Avengers: Infinity War," A truly awesome movie and a lesson on story telling
","To combine so many characters from across the MCU (the original Avengers, the Guardians, Dr. Strange and so many others) and to do it so well is simply spectacular.Handling a battle is difficult, but to handle so many fronts is even harder. The writers did an amazing job.Regarding the directors: ¡Amazing work! They managed to make a good movie and actually gave us a heroes movie where the good guys loose. And the loose hard.Thanos (Josh Brolin) is an extraordinary villain.Also... what an spectacular entrance from Thor in Wakanda. Amazing.",9,0,1,7 August 2019
The Lion King," Awesome
",A spectacular remake of a timeless classic. Everything was awesome!,9,1,3,27 July 2019
La La Land," Most beautiful musical sin Cherbourg...
",A beautiful movie with no happy ending. Very much in the style of 'The Umbrellas pf Cherbourg' this movie is about two lovers who don't end up together.Both Stone and Gosling work magnificently and direction is impeccable.Best movie of the decade.,10,6,9,29 December 2019
Thor," Hard to decide...
","I don't know whether I love the first two Thor movies or hate them. After the character's reboot on Ragnarok, I can't really make up my mind.I love what Taiki made on Thor 3 and what the Russo's did on Endgame... but:1.- As direction goes, this is the best Thor movie ever;
2.- As acting goes, it is pretty lame (Hopkins's Odin excepted);
3.- As writing it is pretty mediocre.
4.- As a cinematographical piece it is awesome.So, it is my opinion that this movie as seen prior to the MCU current standing (Spider-Man: FFH) deserves a six but scored before the original Avengers movie should get 8.",8,0,0,6 December 2019
Joker," Very good but not as good as they say...
","Yes, the movie is very well crafted and the performance by Phoenix is memorable but the movie lacks -in my opinion- that 'plus' or 'extra'.It is a fresh take on the Joker but I have some issues with the script and the cinematography of the movie.",8,2,6,28 December 2019
Marriage Story," Real.
","A movie that depicts what most people go
Up during a divorce. Crafted wonderfully and with acting so extraordinary it shouldn't be a surprise if either of ScarJo or Driver win an Oscar.",9,4,5,10 December 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Extraordinary
","Masterfully crafted. Mr. Waititi delivers an amazing film filled with dark humor.Davis is fantastic, the whole movie, actually, is his show. Chapeau.McKenzie delivers an amazing performance.Scarlett really does deserved the nomination and I wouldn't be surprised if she won.",10,5,11,3 February 2020
Rear Window," Magnificent.
",The whole is crafted with exquisite taste. Everything about it from the script to the set decor is fantastic.AH outdid himself with this movie by relaying on the immense talents of Stewart and Kelly.The whole plot is full with suspense and it will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat.,8,0,0,1 December 2019
