The Avengers," It's a superhero movie what should I say more, one of the best that is!
","This is single-handedly one of the best, if not the best, superhero movies in history. Not just by the shear story and acting but by so many actors (most of them very good ones in general) who play those characters so great. They are specifically cast to be those characters which we can really see. Movie, of course as any other, has its' quirks and mistakes but to a true fan of Sci-Fi in general especially to the Marvel fans this will be in their top 5 movies list. This movie isn't piece of film art but it is not intended to be either and this review is written from that perspective. Acting is really good and one of the main reasons is that almost all actors already had their movies or were part in Marvel movie so they are used to Marvel universe. Another reason is that all actors are really good and are getting along really well. Special effects are also amazing and they have enormous contact with environment and it is hard to distinguish is it really happening or not. SFX are going to draw you even more into the movie. I watched it hundred times and I can't get enough. I recommend it to anyone who likes genres like this and to ones who just want to have plain old fun!",10,1,4,10 May 2014
