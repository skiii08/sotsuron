The Longest Yard," The Longest Nothing of a Movie
","I watched this last night on a whim that it might be entertaining. 'Blah' would be the correct term for this movie. If it had come out five or six years ago, it would have been a bigger hit. I love Adam Sandler but this was not his movie. He is usually THE scene stealer in his movies, but like Mr. Deeds, it was the rest of the cast that made the movie semi-interesting. Chris Rock owned this even after his character died. The football team was hilariously put together, my favorite having been the big guy who liked ping pong (classic). Adam Sandler is not a convincing drunk. Well, he might be convincing, but only for an after school special. Courtney Cox... well... let's just say she has definitely.... improved? (boobies are fun). Nelly was pretty good in the role as the star running back and Burt Reynolds lived up to my expectations of awesomeness. William Fichtner needs to stop playing the asshole who is a total jerk and then is a nice guy at the end for no reason. The real person who stole the show was Tracy Morgan. He just rocks my socks.So to sum up...1) Adam Sandler fans may not be pleased 2) Watch this if you don't like Chris Rock 3) Don't expect the greatest comedic writing but watch it for the game and Chris Rock 4) Rent it, don't buy it, unless you are Chris Rock",5,0,0,19 September 2005
Hostel," Were the critics on crack?
","I was disappointed by Hostel. The commercials made it seem like it really was the scariest movie of all time, stating that paramedics had to be called on scene to take the movie's screeners to the hospital. It really didn't scare me at all like House of 1000 Corpses did. It was very cheesy and the element of imagination in horror movies didn't really exist because I didn't care about the characters. They were college kids who wanted to get laid and instead got mutilated. That's not too original. I'm not saying House of 1000 Corpses is original, I'm just saying that it scared me more, especially because of Dr. Satan and its spiritual aspects. I couldn't wait for the blood and guts in Hostel, but then when it happened all I could do was laugh my ass off at how fake it looked. When the girl's eye popped out I was laughing SO HARD. If you must see this horrible film, rent it... do not buy it. The ending was especially craptacular.",2,1,1,28 April 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," Best movie of 2006, one of the best movies of all time...
","I went to see this movie being a fan of each and every one of the actors for years. My growing obsession with Steve Carell was going to be gratified with this performance and I knew he had to nail it to be the next big thing. Before I say anything about the rest of the movie, HE NAILED IT. But he wasn't the biggest highlight within this amazing ensemble of highlights. I'll start with Alan Arkin.Alan Arkin's Oscar worthy performance as the herion-addicted grandfather was one of the funniest and most incomparable characters in years. This role could have been performed by any other actor but it is Arkin's voice, looks, and complete dry delivery that took the character to amazing heights.Abigail Breslin has more talent than Dakota Fanning will ever hope to achieve in her entire lifetime as an actress. She basically has the lead role in the movie and come awards season, she should be up for every actress nod she gain get. She was adorable and delivered her lines perfectly.Steve Carell was amazing. I knew he could do this. I was very anxious about this role only because of the ignorant moviegoers of our time. He has had a good two years and his fanbase is still pretty juvenile and I was worried that the press would be disappointed along with the population of Steve fans. He didn't disappoint me and luckily the press didn't do what I thought they would do. Anyways, the performance was amazing. I'd love to see him with a nod or even a win, he carried this movie.Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, and Paul Dano all redeemed themselves in this film. All three belong in films like these. Greg Kinnear wasn't annoying for the first time, in a long time. He plays the perfect sincere, good intentioned jerk. Toni Collette handed in an Oscar worthy performance as the Michael Bluth-esquire mother who is just trying to keep things together. Paul Dano freaked the hell out of me in The Ballad of Jack and Rose, and I was absolutely and pleasantly surprised by the job he did.In conclusion, the critics and every one else is right. This is a crowd pleaser. This movie is very easy to fall in love with and is one of the first real movies of the year to be both touching and hilarious at the same time. This was a perfect film.",10,4,9,6 August 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Without a doubt, the most real emotions I have ever seen in a film.
","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is my favorite film. Every character is rich and full of depth, the emotions are subtle but absolutely real, and Jim Carrey gives us the finest acting we have ever seen from him.The concept of the film is an astonishing creation that could only be Kaufman-esquire but the addition of Michel Gondry is delightful. His low special effects camera work and film-making style astounds me. The cinematography is some of the best that I've ever seen especially during the erasing process feeling which felt like a real dream with all its confusions and contortions. Eternal Sunshine was the first movie that I could personally watch over and over and get new emotions every time. I love every character for their flaws and the actors' amazing abilities to create completely real people is spectacular.This film was completely ignored come Oscar time (besides its deserved screenplay award and Kate Winslet's acting nod). Jim Carrey (acting), Michel Gondry (directing), Jon Brion (score), Ellen Kuras (cinematography), and the special effects team should have been nominated for all their respective categories.Eternal Sunshine is the best movie to convey the them of love, loss of love, and redemption that I have ever seen in my entire life. Jim Carrey is one of the finest dramatic actors we have working these days and I wish that he could do more movies like this and The Truman Show.",10,0,2,30 April 2006
The Holiday," Terrible on so many levels, only one redeeming scene
","This film was an embarrassment. It featured two great actors (Winslet and Wallach) and one promising actor (Black) and two box office poison actors (Law and Diaz). Unfortunately for Winslet, Wallach, and Black, this film was doomed because of the terrible script. The movie mainly focuses on Cameron Diaz's story, one that we've heard a hundred times. We're supposed to connect to her because she's American, but no one cares about the American fish-out-of-water story anymore. Diane Lane took that story to new heights in 'Under the Tuscan Sun' but Diaz just ruins it in this film. If Kate Winslet's story were possibly longer or more focused upon, this film could have been better by leaps and bounds. Her story was extraordinarily cute but unfortunately when we see five minutes of her we see twenty minutes of Cameron Diaz.The movie is also too long. Two hours of this movie is absolutely ridiculous. Cameron Diaz and Jude Law have no chemistry. Kate Winslet and Jack Black have a bit of chemistry but it's really Eli Wallach who has the best chemistry with Winslet. Their story wasn't very strong, but it was fun watching them together because you can tell that they actually work hard on their performances. This movie is incredibly boring. You'll find yourself laughing for all the wrong reasons. MST3k to this movie, it helps.The one redeeming scene in the movie is with a cameo from Dustin Hoffman. It was the only thing I was happy about in this movie. That's all... a cameo. That was the only good thing about this film.If you want to see this movie, that's fine. Rent it. Try to get it for free from the rental place, if possible.This was not a good movie.",2,1,4,13 March 2007
