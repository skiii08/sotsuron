The Mask," Not very good at all.
","This film really didn't work for me. Though you can tell that Jim Carrey tried hard and I think it's only fair to say his performance is not too bad, the rest of the film is nonsensical and a bit of a waste of time despite some funny moments. In hindsight, that was Cameron Diaz, was it? Very forgettable performance from her. And it may be just me, but that bald green head actually freaked me out more than amuse me. 4 out of 10 at most.",4,4,19,1 October 1998
Saving Private Ryan," Technically brilliant, but disappointing all the same.
","There's no doubt in my mind that 'Saving Private Ryan' is technically one of the best films ever. Janusz Kaminski should be congratulated for his cinematography, especially in the opening sequence. The sound effects are amazing, and I for one was particularly impressed by the part where the sound of raindrops on leaves imitated the sound of guns firing.It's no understatement to say that Tom Hanks is brilliant. He has proven himself to be the most versatile actor in Hollywood, without exception. If the hype is true that 'Saving Private Ryan' is up against 'The Truman Show' to sweep the Oscars, and Hanks is up against Jim Carrey for Best Actor, then 'Ryan' and Hanks should win hands down.Yet all the same I felt severely disappointed, maybe even cheated, by the movie. Beneath the main plot, a sort of sub-plot developed in which the audience is given glimpses into the internal emotions and mental turmoil of all involved, especially Captain Miller. At least, that's what I perceived the shaking hand and the 'I'm a schoolteacher' bit to mean. The audience is sucked into thinking that, regardless of how many die, and whether or not Ryan is saved, this sub-plot is going to lead to Spielberg's big thematic message, his conclusion, his comment, at the end. But that resolution never comes, and there seems to be no point to the film, nothing it's trying to say. While that in itself is not disappointing, as many films have no message, what is frustrating is being led to feel as though a lesson is coming, and then not getting it.In terms of the violence, I don't think the Omaha beach landing sequence is particularly gruesome, at least no more graphic than the part in the middle where Miller's men apply pressure to a stomach wound, and you feel the victim suffering as he turns white and dies.And, not being an American but an Australian, there has been a lot made of the so-called Americanism of the film, how no black American soldiers seem to be mentioned, and how the other Allied troops are forgotten about, but I tend to think that's no more than pedanticism, taking a stereotypical swipe at a film where such bias has no glaring impact.So in short, 'Saving Private Ryan' is technically brilliant, but it still left a very hollow feeling. 8 out of 10.",Null,0,1,24 November 1998
Jerry Maguire," Absolutely fabulous!
","This is one of those rare movies that you can see over and over again without getting tired of it. Cameron Crowe has come up with something warm, humourous and touching, which I'm sure inspires every viewer on one level or another, if not more than one.Without doubt this is the wittiest movie I have ever seen. It is so beautifully written, and some of the subtle touches are indescribable. You just think about it afterwards and marvel at it.The performances are faultless. Tom Cruise is just marvellous, while Cuba Gooding Jr. is personality all the way. Renee Zellweger is an absolute revelation - I'm sure you'll see more of her undoubted talents in the future. And I think mention also to Bonnie Hunt and Jay Mohr - their characters were not easy to portray but both brought them out very clearly. But I have to say my favourite actor in the film is Jonathan Lipnicki as Ray Boyd, the little kid. This kid's a talent.'The human head weighs eight pounds!' Enough said. 9 out of 10.",Null,2,6,1 October 1998
Mission: Impossible," Spectacular, but shame about the plot.
","Tom Cruise said somewhere that this was a film people weren't expected to understand first-go. Sounded like a revenue-raising plot to me, but the film certainly achieves that purpose.Let me hand out the kudos before the raspberries. It is a spectacular extravaganza of a movie which I enjoyed immensely in watching it. Some of the suspenseful moments (of which there are many) are the best edge-of-your-seat scenes one could ever ask for. The action scenes like at the end, though unbelievable, are explosive to watch. And the film does give you a nice, humourous break in the middle, when Ethan Hunt is hanging from the roof. And the music speaks for itself.But the trouble is, all the above is OK for those who just want entertainment and don't care about the plot. However, most people would be hooked onto the plot, and come out rather confused. Part of the problem comes through the dialogue, much of which is in reflective, but inaudible whispers. Ethan Hunt's flashback sequence just does not work. You can work out the plot if you think about it for a while, but the best films are those which leave you marvelling at its execution and how everything is well unravelled.Not this one. You're too busy thinking the plot through. 6 out of 10.",Null,0,0,1 October 1998
Shine," World-class Australian film
","While it was generally accepted that Australian films are usually quite good and have a great deal to offer, it was also a subconsciously conceded fact that, in terms of getting recognition from, say, Hollywood, it would be a step-by-step process. 'Shine', however, allows Australian cinema to jump a few steps and really get some world attention.Sure, there have been raging arguments recently as to how close (or how totally far away, as the case may be) the plot is from David Helfgott's life, there can be no doubt that this film is exceptional stuff.The fact that Geoffrey Rush won as Oscar for this film says it all. He really was the one playing the piano in the second half of the film (though Helfgott recorded the sound), so he deserves great credit for that. But that is not to take away from the splendid performance of Noah Taylor, who had as much screen time as Rush, and of Armin Mueller-Stahl and Sir John Gielgud. The cinematography is probably underrated, while most of the sets are fabulously appropriate. And the music undoubtedly appeals even to those who avidly avoid classical music.In a year when 'Jerry Maguire' was the only really good major studio flick, and independent films like 'The English Patient' and 'Fargo' won much acclaim, how good it was to see Australian cinema grasp the opportunity with both hands, and come out with something to be so proud of. 8.5 out of 10.",Null,1,1,2 October 1998
Titanic," Return to the good ol' movie experience.
","Every man and his dog's had his say on 'Titanic' so I'll keep this short and sweet.What's great: 1) The ultra-realistic sets. 2) Combination of action and romance into one. 3) All the different forms of special effects. 4) The underrated score, which is so hauntingly appropriate.What's good: 1) Leo was surprisingly creditable. 2) Billy Zane made us all hate his guts so well. 3) Kathy Bates was a bastion of pragmatism. 4) Kate Winslet acted well, but I wish she would smile more.What's bad: 1) The iceberg looked like styrofoam. 2) The script was way too simplistic. 3) Gloria Stuart did not look 100+. 4) How can a 100+ woman climb up on railings? 5) The length - cut out the 1990s treasure-hunter bit!Nonetheless, 'Titanic' reminded us all of what an experience going to the movies used to be but so rarely is these days. 8.5 out of 10.",Null,1,1,1 October 1998
The Truman Show," How good is it? Depends how much you know beforehand.
","How good is 'The Truman Show'? In my opinion, it depends on how much you know beforehand. I already knew quite a lot about the film before I saw it, and frankly I thought the first half was weird if not messy. I was hoping for an immediate explanation of what's going on, introducing more of Christof's involvement. So the second half, which was more satisfying, seemed to come too late. But when I thought about it more, I realised that my disappointment regarding the first half was due to what I knew already. A total stranger to the film will see the first half, be confused rather than impatient, and then marvel at the unravelling in the second half, rather than say 'yeah, and this should have come earlier'. All in all, a very good attempt to cover an ingenious topic, which is so complex most producers would probably shirk away from it. A final word: Jim Carrey is absolutely superb. 8.5 out of 10.",Null,0,0,30 September 1998
Apollo 13," Best film I've seen!
","Without doubt the best movie I've seen. It is edge-of-the-seat stuff, without at any stage offending or scaring the viewer. The pace is nice and manageable, and the sets are fabulous, with the recreation of weightlessness superb, so too the use of 'news footage'. The performances are faultless, with Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris and Kathleen Quinlan all stand-outs for me. But possibly the best part of the movie is its soundtrack, which is so hauntingly appropriate. By no means a perfect movie (eg. parts of the lift-off scene are not that good), but still immensely enjoyable and thought-provoking. 9 out of 10.",Null,2,3,30 September 1998
