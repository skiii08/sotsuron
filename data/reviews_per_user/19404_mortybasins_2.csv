It," Good jump scares, not complete story
","So, the jump scares were there. The cinematography was good. The acting was good. The characters... not bad... although a couple felt like throwaways. But the story... not really an ending. Not knowing going in that this will be more than one movie kind of wrecks it. Without revealing any spoilers, let's just say the main question you want answered, isn't. That's a problem. Too bad, could have been an 8 or 9.",7,0,0,9 May 2019
The Doors," Val Kilmer at his peak!
","Val Kilmer is amazing as Jim Morrison. Not only does he look like him but his acting seems spot on - at least for the little bit of footage I've seem of him outside of televised performances. The film does move along at a slow but nice pace but in the end, it's all about Jim. And in this, Val is the man!!",9,2,3,9 May 2019
