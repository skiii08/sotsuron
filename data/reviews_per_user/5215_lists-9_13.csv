Frost_Nixon," Mediocre
","While this is not a bad film, and is no doubt enjoyed by people with a keener interest in politics than me, it seems to fall flat in a number of areas. Firstly, it's hard to care about either participant: in the film, Nixon is a mean-spirited man thrown out of the top job for criminal activity, but long unwilling to acknowledge that it was his own fault. Frost is shown as a rather lazy playboy who only 'does his homework' in the nick of time.Secondly, can we believe in what we're seeing? Michael Sheen as usual does a very good impersonation of Frost, as well as convincing us that he understands the character. Frank Langella is less successful as Nixon: while his performance is generally competent, he only bears a passing resemblance to the ex-President, and clearly gets Nixon's accent wrong. If this is obvious to me even as a 'Brit', then there must be quite a few Americans who find his voice grating. I realise that actors are about more than just impersonation, but convincing the audience that they could be watching the real life characters is part of the essence of this kind of film and, for me, this aspect didn't work.Thirdly, the whole thing is just a bit over-dramatised: necessary, perhaps, just to keep us watching, but at times it becomes rather silly. I agree absolutely with the other poster here who says 'the Frost/Nixon interviews were merely a relatively inconsequential event here being treated as if they were life-and-death'.Overall, a moderately entertaining film, but only worth watching if you have nothing better to do, or are a keen student of 20th century US history.",5,5,11,31 August 2009
Star Trek," An action-packed, fun ride
","As a fan of the original series who has just forked out a tidy sum for the Blu-ray version of Season 1, I have to say that the new film pushed all the buttons for me.The opening is absolutely terrific, with both action and emotion and, apart from a few minutes in the middle of the film, the pace hardly slackens throughout. Most of the cast are thoroughly engaging – I particularly enjoyed the performances of Christopher Pine, Karl Urban (doing a brilliant version of DeForest Kelley) and Zachary Quinto. The only character who didn't entirely come off in my book was Scotty. Simon Pegg's Scots accent is better than James Doohan's, but the film's attempts at comedy are its least successful aspect and come across as rather laboured. There are certainly scenes that are more reminiscent of Star Wars (a franchise that doesn't appeal to me) than Star Trek, but this didn't offend me at all. While the time travel device is used in a fairly unsubtle way, and purists can no doubt pick various holes in the plot, is this is really important in an action film? Star Trek sets out to entertain and, in this respect, it succeeds completely.I don't think it's giving anything away to say that the script does two odd things with the character of Spock, that are most apparent towards the end of the film. It'll be interesting to see how these oddities develop in any sequels.and while I'm talking about sequels, if the team are looking for stories from the original series to remake or 're-imagine', forget Khan and the Tribbles – how about the classic The Menagerie/The Cage? The original story cried out for realistic settings and the Talosians, cleverly realised as they were, could no doubt be done even better in the 21st century. It can't be beyond the wit of Hollywood's writers to think of some apposite new twist to the theme of mind control",8,1,3,26 September 2009
Batman Returns," Less than the sum of its parts
","Watching this for the first time recently on Blu-ray, I was a little disappointed. The film has a lot going for it: a great music score; an impressive use of colour; vividly-drawn villains; nice sets; beautiful photography. The problems seem to be with the plot and the handling of the characters. A lot of the action seems arbitrary, with all of the characters lacking believable motivation. It's hard to care about any of them. Danny DeVito as the Penguin makes a better villain than Jack Nicholson's Joker (the previous film had toppled over into 'the Jack Nicholson show') but the actor and the director fail to make the character even vaguely sympathetic. The Penguin wants to be liked, so what does he do to achieve this? He's a villain so, naturally, he cons everyone. Michael Keaton is competent as Batman but again, it's hard to warm to him. Even having seen the previous film, the viewer doesn't get much sense of what makes him do what he does. Michele Pfeiffer's Catwoman comes off best in this respect, mainly down to a good performance: again, the script doesn't make much sense any of her actions.The director's eccentricities are initially appealing, but the film just isn't enough *fun*. Maybe Tim Burton did treat the material with respect, but the overall effect is too po-faced. The essential ridiculousness of the characters isn't quite acknowledged – we don't laugh at these grotesque and dysfunctional people, but we can't believe in them either. Finally, the film is too long-winded. With tighter editing, ten or fifteen minutes could easily be taken off its running time, giving it a faster pace.I'll be branded as a heretic for saying so, but I think the third of the initial Batman quadrilogy (Batman Forever) is the best of the four films for bringing back the fun, just as Ed Wood is the best of Tim Burton's films by a long way.",6,0,2,6 September 2010
Romeo + Juliet," Didn't work
","Had to post this. I've kept reading (since MOULIN ROUGE was released) what a genius Baz Luhrmann is, but I have to say I was disappointed with this. Maybe it's possible to set Shakespeare in the present day, but on this evidence, it just doesn't work. I watched the film on a rented DVD. I don't know the play well, and on occasions lost track of what was happening, so I tried to follow the text in my Complete Works of Shakespeare. It seemed to me that there were lots of passages of INVENTED Shakespearean verse - or did I just imagine this? Apart from the failure to convey the emotion that's vital to this story, there were examples throughout where the modern setting made nonsense of the story. At the crux of it all, I couldn't help asking myself why Pete Postlethwaite didn't tell Claire Danes 'Now shallst thou to thy mobile phone ... Go and inform thy Romeo of our deed'! thus averting the tragedy and saving us from a truly feeble rendition of the climax. To me, the Zeffirelli version was better on every level.",3,1,4,26 January 2002
The Shining," An overrated travesty of a great novel
","I've watched this twice because, the first time round, I couldn't believe how awful it was. The script, direction and performances completely throw away the empathy created by Stephen King's brilliant novel and the impression is that the director felt either indifferent to or contemptuous of the source material. The received wisdom is that the late Stanley Kubrick was a genius. Not on the evidence of this film. He may have been a talented film-maker but he is/was not the New Messiah.Kubrick's Shining is a travesty of the book, a one-dimensional film without any emotional impact. The trailers are intriguing but, in truth, there is little more to the film than they show. None of the performances (with the possible exception of Scatman Crothers') have any light or shade and the music score - cobbled together from Bartók, Penderecki and Ligeti - is monotonously bleak. The whole driving force of King's story is cancelled out by Kubrick's lack of build-up and the casting of Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance. As this Torrance is clearly insane and murderous from the start of the film, there is no story to tell. Similarly, Shelley Duvall's Wendy is ready to descend into hysteria at a moment's notice. Duvall's character is completely lacking in the gutsy resourcefulness that a proper portrayal needs. The viewer has to wonder why this version of Wendy contemplated going with Jack in the first place, and didn't go off to her mother's as suggested.Even worse, Kubrick trivialised the central idea of the Shining, casting the expressionless Danny Lloyd in the role of Danny and reducing his psychic alter ego Tony to a waggling finger! King's careful build-up of a supernatural threat is trivialised into a series of scares and 'chilly' scenes. Kubrick reportedly auditioned thousands of boys for the role and still managed to get one without any apparent acting ability. Kubrick and his collaborators also threw away the important character of Hallorann, having him killed off immediately on his reappearance. Surely it's arrogance to disrespect your source in this way.Admittedly, the film's visuals are impressive: but it seems to be about creating striking images and little else. The result is a relentlessly cold experience that never elicits any sympathy for the characters: a multi-million dollar ornament. Fans of Peter Greenaway and people who enjoy 'art house' films will like it but, for those of us who enjoyed the book, the film is an ordeal. I may be a heretic but this film annoys me intensely as a representation of a great novel; nor is it good storytelling.",2,6,16,19 October 2016
The Mist," Too bleak for me
","I enjoyed the novella on which this film was based very much and, after hearing lots of good reviews, had high expectations of the film. Writer/Director Frank Darabont winds up the tension admirably. There are lots of horrific, even harrowing scenes, the character development is interesting and the special effects are never less than good.So I wasn't totally disappointed, but I did feel that the film's downbeat tone spoiled it. Frank Darabont is well known for his adaptations of Stephen King stories, but his two previous films - 'The Shawshank redemption' and 'The green mile' - had hope and optimism, despite being tragic.The mood of 'The mist' is relentlessly bleak. I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone, but I'm not revealing anything you won't already know by saying that it isn't a happy one. Yes, it's both clever and ironic, but I agree with some of the previous posters - it feels to me like a cheat. In my opinion, it would have been better left 'open' - unresolved, as in the novella. I watch all films hoping for a positive, life-enhancing experience, and Frank Darabont's have given me that so far. I feel a bit let-down and disappointed by the depressing outcome of this one.",4,2,5,31 December 2008
Sinister," Very creepy
","An extremely creepy film that manages to explore the darker side of human (and, possibly, inhuman) nature without wallowing in blood and overt violence. There is certainly plenty of violence and cruelty in the film, but these are largely implied rather than shown, and this is the film's strength.The opening scene hits the viewer right between the eyes with a horrific event captured by the cold eye of an old-fashioned 8mm camera. The viewer immediately wants to know why this is being filmed (a question later asked by the central character), and this becomes the movie's theme.As Ellison Oswalt, a once successful true crime writer desperate to repeat his one success - now years in the past - Ethan Hawke makes an excellent Everyman and is convincing throughout. The rest of the cast are competent, but this is almost (not quite) a solo show. The film builds to a powerful climax, the only wrong note being that the spectres (when they appear) are too solid and prosaic, like children in face paint, marring the earlier mood of barely-glimpsed evil. Overall, though, well worth viewing.",8,1,1,18 May 2014
The Descent," Encapsulates everything wrong with the modern horror film
","Sadly, for me my title says it all. I foolishly chose this as my 'evening's entertainment' after a completely misleading comment from someone that it was a 'psychological thriller'. For me, it turned out to be as far from that description as possible! After a slow build-up that I found tedious rather than interesting - with one exception, the accident near the beginning - things quickly descended into the usual feast of brutality, extreme violence and gore. Thankfully, the second half of the film takes place in semi-darkness: unlike some members of the audiences of these films, I don't enjoy seeing characters being violently mutilated in close-up.To summarise, then, what I disliked about this film was its feeble character development (I found I couldn't work out who was being killed or injured and, what's more, I didn't really care); a reliance on 'sudden jolts' and brutal violence instead of atmosphere; dialogue often delivered in barely audible 'throw away' style. Maybe this was why the revenge subplot made no sense to me and, even at the end, I couldn't work out the relevance of the road accident near the beginning. The idea behind the film also seemed to me a bit of a nonsense - to take a group of people into an unknown cave when only a couple of them are experienced potholers should have struck the whole party as blatantly suicidal.On the plus side, I was intrigued by the accident near the beginning and its bearing on the rest of the plot - I just found that my revulsion at the second half of the film meant I couldn't give it close enough attention to find out.Don't get me wrong: I have enjoyed plenty of horror films over the years. Three of my favourites are Carrie, Hellraiser and Witchfinder General. All of these contain blood, violence and brutality. The difference between these films and The Descent is that the nastiness is relevant to their plots, and they all have characters the viewer can empathise with. I'm baffled and disturbed by the popularity of films that seem to wallow in violence for its own sake, and by the number of good reviews The Descent seems to have got.",2,7,12,31 August 2008
Pulp Fiction," Just Nasty
","Well made, competently directed, cleverly scripted: yes. But I've rarely seen such an unpleasant film. To me, Pulp Fiction summarises everything that's wrong with modern film-making. We are asked to laugh at someone being shot in the head, to find violence 'cool' and to be entertained by murder and drug addiction. None of the characters are remotely sympathetic and I don't think I'm alone in needing some one to 'root for' in order to enjoy a film.I hate to sound moralistic (I'm an atheist, but hopefully humanist). However, I have to side with the minority who found this film excessive in all the wrong ways. I find it genuinely disturbing that so many people enjoyed it.",2,5,13,29 January 2003
Titanic," Spoiled by commercialism
","This is a moderately entertaining film, but overlong and certainly not deserving of multiple Oscars. I've found that, on video, it's best watched in several sessions! I was an early fan of James Cameron and am depressed to see the extent that success has led him to excess. As in THE ABYSS, the director's self-importance seems to radiate from the screen.I'm surprised at how few people comment on the music. To me it is the most trite, tacky and clumsy part of the whole thing. Whenever we hear the theme that goes with the horrible song 'The heart will go on' - which is often! - whatever mood James Cameron has managed to create is destroyed. This is particularly grating towards the end. I found this film's music score particularly disappointing bearing in mind that James Horner has written some excellent film scores.",6,2,3,2 June 2002
Inception," Chaotic and pretentious
","I'll begin by saying that I have an inbuilt prejudice against films that seem to put cleverness or 'intelligence' ahead of entertainment value. Having read a lot about this film, I wasn't sure whether I would like it, but in fact was very disappointed to end up disliking it as much as I did.For me, the film lacked two essential elements of an entertaining movie - a coherent plot and sympathetic characters. The plot didn't really start to make any sense until about halfway through (far too late) and Leonardo di Caprio as the central character, Cobb, was competent but just didn't have the charisma to carry this kind of story. His wife's death was foreshadowed a lot in the early part of the film and I found I just didn't care how or why she died. None of the other characters came across as real people and their connection to Cobb was generally unclear to me. The impression was of good actors (like Tom Hardy) being basically wasted.I almost switched off the film after the first twenty minutes because its chaotic action seemed designed almost to alienate the viewer. It started to make some sense after that, but was still a long way from what a good film should be. The over-reliance on sudden loud noises (way above the level of the dialogue) in the first half was simply irritating.The film also seemed to have trouble obeying its own internal logic. Several reviewers have mentioned that there was no consistency in what is supposed to happen when a dreamer dies during a dream; I was unimpressed by the 'projections' in the dreams apparently having their own personalities and being capable of independent thought, although the script also had them as nothing more than figments of the dreamer's imagination.Yes, the film's settings and special effects were impressive, but that's really not what an evening out (or in) should be about. If the story and characterisations are lacking, then why bother watching at all?",4,38,71,18 March 2011
Carrie," Brilliantly-done tragedy
","Almost everything about Carrie is brilliantly done. It is a tragedy in the fullest sense, with the outcome inevitable from the start. Sissy Spacek's faultless performance seems to have the ability to make almost every viewer (male or female) empathise with her character, and the result is a sad film, but a genuine emotional experience. The supporting cast hardly put a foot wrong (Piper Laurie is particularly memorable) and Pino Donaggio's music is just right. As a 1970s film, it has dated only in that the styles of clothing and some of the attitudes now seem rather comical.I was dismayed to see another comment on the IMDb that the film was poor because there wasn't enough gore! I feel this person has totally misunderstood what good horror films are (or should be) about.Perhaps the only wrong note is the shock ending, which is admittedly effective. This tends to undermine everything that has gone before, by portraying Carrie as a monster. By that time it should be obvious to an intelligent viewer that she is the main victim in the story.",9,0,0,22 August 2001
Bruce Almighty," Bit of a missed opportunity
","This could have been dazzling but, for me, was a misfire, mainly because the Jim Carrey character was so hard to like. I'm a Carrey fan, but in this case, the script and direction seemed to be against him.Near the start of the film, Bruce's boss refers to another character as 'an asshole' and says 'You couldn't be'. However, he behaves like one through most of the film, with his whining and complaining seriously overdone. You have to wonder why his girlfriend sticks with him for so long. As often, the dog (when he appears) steals the show. The best scenes are the ones a third of the way through, after Bruce first gets his powers. Here the film shows energy, with Carrey doing what he's best at - being an amusing 'wise guy'. After this, though, it all gets a bit tedious. The performances are fine, particularly from Carrey and Morgan Freeman, but the filmmakers don't seem sure about where they're heading, or what the moral (if any) is. Ultimately the film is a bit of a mess.",5,0,1,15 November 2006
