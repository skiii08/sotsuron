The Blair Witch Project," Very mediocre.
","The hype was as a matter of fact the cleverest and most professional part of the movie. The 'documentary' style would've  worked so much better if the actors weren't so amateurish and unconvincing. The camerawork absolutely sucked even considering it was supposed to be shot by film students scared to death -- a four-year child could've done a better job. The constant, stupid bobbing of picture, even when the camera was placed on the ground as it would seem, made the experience of watching this flick physically(!) nauseating, which has yet to happen with any  other movie. In short, skip it.",Null,0,0,27 March 2000
