Scarface," The Best Movie.
","Scarface is by far the greatest and most ingenious written movie of all time. There is almost no blood except the bathroom scene where Tony's friend gets cut apart with a chainsaw. They don't actually show him getting cut, all they show is blood being spattered on the shower curtain. There is a lot of F-words in the movie but you will get used to it quickly as you will be drawn to the movie. Tony starts out small working in a sandwich bar, then works his way to the top by retrieving the Yay from another drug dealer and giving it to Frank Lopez. From there he works his way to the top. Tony's supplier is Alejandro Sosa, and in the end one of his hit-men kill Tony with a shotgun at close range from the back. That was after tony took 20-30 bullets from machine guns. I would say Tony is tough. Watch the movie and you would love it.",10,0,1,19 July 2006
