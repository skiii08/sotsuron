Scarface," Wonderful, simply wonderful.
","I just saw this movie for the first time and I must say that it is one of the best I've ever seen. The direction is wonderful, the script is great and Pacino does the performance of his life.It seems that this is a movie you either love or hate, but I have a hard time understanding the arguments of those critical to the movie. It seems that the main reasons for disliking 'Scarface' are:1. Too long (170 minutes) Granted, three hour is a long time, but show some patience people! Personally I didn't notice any scene that felt irrelevant to the story (something some people have complained about) , but I guess the MTV-crowd will have their attention-span put to the test.2. Too much violence/foul language. This, I don't get at all. Imagine if you removed the violence and swearing. Would that feel the least bit authentic?To sum it up: Just sit down and watch it dammit! :)",Null,0,0,24 November 2001
