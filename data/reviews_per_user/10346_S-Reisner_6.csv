Mission: Impossible III," god, i hope there'll be a fourth
","i really do hope there could be a fourth one, this is definitely going to be one of the biggest movies of the summer and was quite enjoyable. A lot more entertaining than the first two, the first was confusing then slow, then confusing and a little exciting, the second was slow and slow and slow then action packed. But i really like this one, Laurence Fishburne was great and he could be an interesting character to bring to the fourth. there was a lot of action in this, and it wasn't mindlessly violent either, every scene of action (which there were a lot of) had something important to do with the plot, Cruise definitely made himself look like an action superstar in this and the fight scene at the end was really well done. They got right to it this time, didn't start violent but went right to the plot, the first action scene was terrific and we see how smart the special ops team can be. The rest was an edge of your seat thriller with no boring romance, just tom going nuts on bad guys and using some super cool stunts. The bridge scene on the ads was much more violent and intense as it came out to be, there were new characters who were in it and Cruise did no more solo missions this time, it seemed that he was always with the team, just not in the end. If they make a fourth, they should make it like this one.",9,0,2,5 May 2006
Home Alone," A great family comedy
","There's nothing better to watch on Christmas time than Home Alone.Its a funny, well written family film with good slapstick and idiot burglars that stole the show. Really the credit for this film being so funny goes to Daniel Stern, he's probably the best Movie comedian since John Belushi and he plays a great idiot.The film is about two idiot burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) hitting every house on a block except for one because Kevin, the brilliant nine year old fooled them that someone was there and they skipped it, then when they find out that Kevin is the only one there they set out to rob the house, but they'll have trouble getting through Kevin's little house of fun.Watch it, you won't be disappointed, the slap stick for such a young kid is great, Pesci and Stern are hysterical and it's all good.",10,0,1,27 January 2006
Silent Hill," creepy and gory horror film
","i haven't played the games so don't know much about the silent hill world. But i love this movie. I was in a really bad mood when watching this and was somewhat in the mood for a dark and creepy film. What i found was Silent Hill. There is not much gore or violence which lowered my rating but there are many creepy elements and all the scenes of gore are fantastic. Three of the goriest things I've ever seen come from this movie. The ending is a bit weird but i didn't care, the scares, gore and violence saved it. The acting was not bad like in most video game movies and the effects were incredible. If your a fan of gore horror, then this is a must see.",9,0,1,4 November 2006
Saving Private Ryan," The best war movie ever made
","flawless. That's the one word i would use to describe this film. I've never seen anything like it, it was definitely written by someone in the war and with respect for those who served in World War II. The acting is perfect and every bit of it is exactly how my grandparents describe war. If your seeing this not for the storyline, but for the violence, then shame on you. I am rarely touched by movies, but this touched me, especially the ending. Every battle scene is brilliantly played out and every actor does a brilliant job. If you haven't seen this movie, then you better get off your computer and run out and go see it. It is by far the best war movie ever made and a classic.",10,2,3,7 April 2006
War of the Worlds," first role i actually liked tom cruise in
","I finally got around to watching this movie today and let me say it is an awesome movie. It was very suspenseful with some of the best special effects I've ever seen. Most directors use large explosions to make their movies cool and show off that they can make fire, but spieldberg uses CGI dinosaurs and giant 'tripod' alien machines and CGI aliens to show off. This role was actually good for tom cruise, i love the mission:impossible films (except the first), but i don't exactly like the character of Ethan Hunt. I liked Ray Ferrier, the kids didn't and that didn't really phase him, but he is not one-dimensional and he did blow off a lot of extra money at work because he had to go see his kids. There were some scenes when i was like 'what are you doing?'. But at least he showed emotion for his kids and always made sure they were safe. I liked it when he wouldn't let his daughter see him and TIm RObbins go at it, though i wouldve liked to see that fight. The gore in this movie is decent for a pg-13 film and doesn't gross you out (those with soft stomachs might hurl, but whatever). The special effects are great and it was great to see TOm Cruise actually take charge of the situation without using violence. It is scary at some points when it shows how crazy people will go to keep themselves alive.All in all, great remake of a classic, great special effects and a great main character. Don't miss this one",10,0,2,3 August 2006
Click," By far the best comedy movie in years
","This movie was wonderful. It had drama and a lot of original jokes that don't get old. Everyone wishes they could mute someone or go back in time and fast forward through something, this movie let Michael Newman, an overly working architect do that. He even used the contrast button on the remote and turned himself into a green guy and a purple dude. It is true how kids grow up fast, he missed one year and his kids had moved from dragon tales to watching CSI. That scene was very funny, i was disappointed in seeing parents bring five year old kids to see a pg-13 movie on which the adds clearly showed sexual themes. But i suppose parents do that a lot nowadays, this movie had a very comic affect even when he didn't have the remote. Then it got very touching when he went to the future and his dad was dead, then he lost his wife and his father died and he missed him though he never thought he would. The neighbor Kevin O'Doyle, the annoying little brat who seems to try to make Newmans life suck and always brags about the cool things his family has. It was hilarious when Newman got his brief payback. This is the first movie since Fun with Dick and Jane and Big Momma's house 2 when i heard the whole theater laugh out loud. LArry the cable guy and date movie seemingly didn't have that effect. I almost cried watching this movie and i am hardly ever touched, the film was far more original than any other recent film without using the gross or mentally challenged humor. Don't pass this movie by, its an all around great movie.",10,3,10,24 June 2006
