Requiem for a Dream," A requiem for Darren Aronofski
","A true cinematic tragedy. Trust me when I say to all you lovers of cinema, that this is not an easy viewing. The only redemption to this film are Ellen Burstyn's splendid solo scenes. Not only does the acting quality of the movie vastly improve - do not forget that this is Ellen Burstyn - ,but Aronofski changes the visual aesthetic to something that is reminiscent of Fincher's and Lynch's, which without saying is much more appealing then Aronofski's own style that he pursues throughout most of the movie. The rest of the movie is filled with bland and ineffective camera angles, and above all else terrible acting from Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans.Another bone I have to pick is the repetition of the same montage, it makes what the character's are doing less symbolic, you see it so many times it becomes ordinary. The film is also unrealistic in terms of it's action and dialogue. The soundtrack is great, unfortunately it didn't belong in this movie. The scenes simply did not - for the most part - merit the songs that they got.The last 30 minutes were the most enjoyable parts of the film.In conclusion, if you are looking for a great performance by Ellen Burstyn I without a doubt would recommend this movie. However, if you are looking for a good film about characters with drug addictions, I suggest you go elsewhere.May I recommend Drugstore Cowboy, Trainspotting, Enter the Void or Less Than Zero.",4,0,0,22 June 2020
