The Blair Witch Project," Huge waste of money and time!!
","I can not not believe the rave reviews this movie has received.  Perhaps I am biased because the hand-held, choppy camera work made me very nearly sick, but I didn't find one second of this film to be in the least bit scary.  Stupid?  Yes.  Boring?  Yes.  I saw this in a theater that was about half-full and, when it was over, the comments, including numerous snickers, seemed to be along the lines of, 'Is that it?'  'What's the big deal?' 'What a joke!'",Null,0,0,16 September 1999
