The Lobster," I Want MyTwo Hours Back
","I kept hoping it would get better. I laughed once in one or two places, so I thought it would. But, it didn't.That's all I really needed to say, but here are more words because website demands it:This reminds me of the 90s, when everyone was claiming to like sushi because it was so 'cool', but it really wasn't.Another similarity is The Emperors New Clothes. Hello people, the film stunk.This film was unnecessarily violent.The acting was good, but wasted.Life is what you make it. I feel sorry for the author and producer.",1,13,17,13 June 2016
