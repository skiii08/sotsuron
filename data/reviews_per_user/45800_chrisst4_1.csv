The Monuments Men," Important Message But Poor History
","I was expecting so much more from this film given the great cast and the historically important true story. Unfortunately the lighthearted tone and stereotyping of anyone French and British made this feel like a Disney-rewrites-history film.This leads me on to the historical inaccuracies. Whilst very loosely based on fact the film has, like so many older WWII movies, been tailored to appeal to a more local demographic. For example, the number involved and roles they played; the origin of the group in 1942 in Libya by the British etc. This is deeply sad, because you are left viewing the whole movie as a work of fiction, which undermines those who did such important work to save great works of art, transcending the war itself. This film had an important point to make regarding the loss of great art through conflict but could have been so much better.See http://www.historyextra.com/feature/historian-movies- monuments-men-reviewed",1,3,6,3 May 2014
