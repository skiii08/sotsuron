Marie Antoinette," historical value - almost none, personal and intimate - definitely
","I guess many people did not appreciate the feature because of its lightness and lack of detail. The film abounds with scenes that were completely unimportant for France and its political doings - it is more a personal account of the lightness of MA's life - well she was only 14 when she got married - how serious could her life get? She poked fun at the whole Versailles traditions and customs and this film is just about that. So if you expect to get intellectually richer, then forget this film, but if you are interested how people used to party in France, then go for it. Even though it was a bit of a chick-flick, I still appreciated the beauty of costumes, lights and just the general beauty of it all.",5,0,0,18 January 2009
