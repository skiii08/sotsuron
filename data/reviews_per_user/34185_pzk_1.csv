The Blair Witch Project," What's all the fuzz about? It sucks!
",I really do not understand how this movie got to be so popular. I mean it Sucks. It is NOT scary at all. Just annoying. Well i guess if you were one of the 3 people who actually thought it was real then... Also it is unbelievable that someone would just keep on filming when they think that they are about to get killed. STUPID!Rating -1-,1,1,3,4 February 2000
