Blade Runner 2049," It didn't offend me, which is a lot.
","Let's get the obvious out of the way: the movie is way better than any Marvel, DC, Star Wars, random remake garbage that we have seen in the last decade.It is not purposely dumb, it is not spamming CGI in your face (even though it is constantly present) and it doesn't feel the need to make enormous explosions all over.Now, 3 things really bothered me about this movie: - to say two kids have the same DNA but they have a different sex is retarded on so many levels i can't even begin to comment - why does Gosling only have 1 expression, even when he is walking through walls? - Jared Leto is just garbage hereIt was a good movie, I'm not really sure how to feel about it, but there's nothing great or iconic in it. I praise the guys for having tried to do a good movie without being the force awakens level of pathetic.P.S. Yes those that say it was way too boring, they do have a point.",7,9,20,5 October 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," It's a Disney movie, not a Star Wars movie
","DON'T PAY FOR THIS MOVIE.Looking at it objectively, it is a garbage movie, it is a lot better than the force awakens, since it is not nearly as offensive to a SW fan, but it still has most of the problems.first the positives:The main chick was in my opinion, decent. Somewhat original dialog and she sure is cute. The movie itself does not feel like a clone of another movie. now the negatives: as I said before, this is a Disney movie, so the common problems with Disney movies apply. It is racist, as casting people strictly to have as many races present, is inherently racist. Now you have a Persian guy, because you know, those Arabs have a lot of money, of course the main character is a female and so on... The evil guys never stand a chance, someone raise a hand if they thought the plans were not going to be delivered. The character are all flat, undeveloped and you just don't care. The fight scenes are awful. This one especially hurts, since SW is supposed to have the best fights, and yet now we see normal humans punching into protective armors instead of using a blaster, because, well Disney. The last problem, which I consider the most important, given that I knew going in that a 5/10 movie was the best possible considering the premises, is that it is SOOOOOOOOO BOOOOOORING. There was not one scene that I really enjoyed, this movie was just there. Why couldn't we get at least 15 minutes of Darth Vader killing everyone? We only got him killing random no name character and it was not impressive at all. Change the world for the better, don't pay to see this movie.",3,35,69,26 December 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy," It's basically a dumbed down fast and furious
","I held on on watching this for a long time, as I hate one liner jokes, 0 plot and awful character development, which is basically 99% of what Marvel movies are about.I expected the fighting scenes to be confusing and flat.I expected the movie to tell me how I should feel instead of giving me a reason to feel that way.I expected a villain with 0 credibility and awful CGI.That's all par for the course, what I did not expect though, is to fall asleep after 10 minutes after I just had a big coffee. Seriously, this movie is so incredibly boring that I fail to understand why people like it so much.This movie was so painful to sit through, and not just because of the dumbness of everything that was going on, that much was already a given, I mean it's a superhero movie with a full CGI raccoon among the top stars..Special note to the awful soundtrack that went against the flow of the movie.All in all, this one is not as dumb as Doctor Strange, but it's close to be and it is just as unfunny. Legitimately after the movie, I had no idea in which place and time the movie was happening. Give it a go if you have insomnia.",1,2,5,14 May 2017
Wonder Woman," An acceptable flick, as long as your brain is switched off
","I have to cut the author some slack on this, let's face it, WW is a silly, nonsensical comic with an OP hero. Given this premise, it can't be easy to make a quality movie.Pros: Gal is very solid at portraying a naive Greek style warrior, the secretary was charmingly funny and the movie does a good job of explaining what is WW all about and what does she stand for.Cons: You have to try really hard not to try to look at the historical part of the movie, because it's so wrong it will burn your brain, most of what is happening is unnecessary, most of the characters including Ares is there just so that something is happening, the twist is forced and pointless, the CGI is way too much, more and more... the worst thing though are the fight scenes which are, just like in almost every comic movie, mind-blowingly nonsensical.The more you try to think about what was happening in the movie, the dumber the movie looks, however if you manage to switch off your brain completely, WW is an enjoyable enough movie that you can see, have a good time, forget and never see again.",6,5,14,6 June 2017
