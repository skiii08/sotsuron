Hereditary," Shocked at how good it was!
","A completely original horror, full of scares and tension. This film creates scares more than jump-scares. Terrifying themes and some scenes I wish I could forget they were that intense!",10,3,6,2 July 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Abrams played it safe so not much to dislike
","I think Abrams did a sterling job of picking up the pieces of Episode 8, closing it off in an acceptable (and slightly predictable) way. If he'd made the script 'too out there' like the previous episode, people would have gone nuts, so I understand how some people may see this finale as quite bland and straightforward. Nevertheless, it brought in new ideas I didn't think I'd see, and a few great twists along the way. Well done Abrams",10,5,16,20 December 2019
Toy Story 4," Pixar never fails!
","This fourth Toy story hit me with all the feels. It's story was exciting, funny and emotional as ever, and was a brilliant addition to the trilogy. The ending too was extremely poignant, a real tear jerker!",9,1,4,1 July 2019
Midsommar," A true horror film with incredible cinematography
",I like horror films that don't rely on jump scares to scare you. This is a truly original horror with some of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen. The main actress is also phenomenal.,10,3,9,16 July 2019
The Shape of Water," Fantastic love story
","Love every aspect of this film; the music, the cinematography, the acting, the setting, all perfect. The only let down is the Russian accents. As someone who has studied Russian for a decade, they sound like actors who don't know the language which is a shame.",9,3,10,9 August 2019
