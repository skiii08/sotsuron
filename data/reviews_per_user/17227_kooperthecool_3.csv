The Blair Witch Project," Who do i see about getting the last 86 minutes of my life back?
","It was all so good until the last ten minutes? What the hell happened?! It had such good potential: some amateur directors go into the woods to explore an urban legend. Brilliant. OK, sure, the camera is enough to make you projectile vomit in your seat but still, its good. It is undeniable that the first hour or so was good. Pretty freaky stuff, a lot of dark camera scenes. My only criticism with the first hour or so is the constant use of the word 'f*ck'. How is it possible to say 'f*ck' 133 times in the period of 86 minutes? Right, top rant over, we get to the final hurdle. They follow the sound of Josh's voice into a funny house. Was Heather deaf or just stupid? If she found his tongue and teeth wrapped up in a nice little package, why would you follow the supposed sound of his voice? No tongue, no noise. Simple.After stumbling around a house for a couple of minutes, they explore the attic and the basement where both cameras are dropped. What i fail to understand, however, is why Mike dropped his camera and how the hell they both died. So when Heather drops her camera, we see Mike standing in the corner of the room. What the hell? Nothing wrong with standing in the corner. He may have to come realise that he is, after all, a dunce. How would that kill you? And why would their bodies not be found? Maybe because nobody cared.Sure, it's easy to criticise and i probably wouldn't have come up with that idea in a million years, but if you're going to act on a good idea...do it well.In conclusion, it was a film with good potential but awful execution.",1,2,6,5 March 2007
Zodiac," Does the real Zodiac case justice
","After watching a documentary about the Zodiac killings, my sister and i decided to go to the cinema last night a watch the film.I loved the way everything was set out to look like it really was filmed in the 1960's. The killings were done very well displaying almost complete factual correctness with the following exceptions:1) Paul Stine was shot in the right temple, no below his right ear 2) The taxi cab was found to be parked next to a fire hydrant 3) The executioners mask that the zodiac wears was square and hand madeI thought that the end of the film was perfect when Robert Graysmith looks Lee in the eye at the hardware store for at least 30 seconds. Just as he'd stated earlier in the film that he wanted to look zodiac in the eye and know it was him.Perfect.I also love how the letter with the word 'radian' in was not analysed, as this was not figured out until years after the police received it.The zodiac case is one that intrigues me. Personally, i believe Arthur Leigh Allen was the Zodiac but he took that to his grave.I loved this film, i really did! Definitely worth the Â£6 to get in.",10,8,14,23 May 2007
Silent Hill," Amazing film done brilliantly
","I was unable to see this film until it came out on DVD about a month ago and i loved it. In total, i have watched Silent Hill 4 times and each time it grows on me even more.The creatures in the film were done superbly, although i would have liked to have seen them a little bit more. Each creature was seen before vanishing not to be seen again through the duration of the film. The Babies - were done very well and i loved the way they disintegrated as dark became light. I loved the use of real people instead of CGI animation.The Acid shooter thing - unsure of it's real name but it was done so well. The way it walked was gruesome enough and the way the acid dripped down it's body was amazing.Pyramidhead - brilliant...possibly could have done with some underwear, but hey, i'm not complaining. I loved the way he was put on stilts and his body was made 25% larger than everyone else's. I would have liked to have seen him kill someone with his sword but killing Anna managed to display his shere size and strength, which was amazing.The Nurses - were perfect. I loved their costumes, they way they walked, and the way they interacted with one another. I want their dresses.I did, however, have some trouble understanding where Rose, Sharon, and Cybil actually were. After just watching the film for the four time, i still cannot decide if they're in purgatory due to the car crash. I shall assume they were though. This is an amazing film and did the game justice -x-",9,0,1,24 September 2006
