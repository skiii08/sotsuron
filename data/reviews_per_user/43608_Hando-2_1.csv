Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Do people really think this is good?
","Okay, so I went and saw Star Wars yesterday and would have to say that it is unquestionably the worst most disappointing film I have ever seen at the cinema. It is awful. There are so many things stacked against it. The plot is rubbish. Who cares about trade wars? The script is laughable. Where is the emotion in the actors voices? McGregor and Neeson are pathetic, whatever the papers may have you believe. Jar Jar didn't get a single laugh from the audience through the film, yet he's supposed to be funny?!? Err...slapstick comedy that you've seen done 50,000 times, and usually 50,000 times better too, isn't going to make us laugh. The only people who like rubbish like this are those who are shallow enough to care about the 'wonderful scenery' etc etc. in the film. Go and look at some mountains if you want aesthetic visuals.Final verdict: I urge people not to watch it. It's SOOO predictable, and SOOO tedious. It is NOT exciting because you know exactly what is going to happen. AVOID.",Null,0,1,17 July 1999
