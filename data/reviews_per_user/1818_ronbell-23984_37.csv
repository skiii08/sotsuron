The Blair Witch Project," Over hyped and overrated s***
","This doesn't even deserve one star but it's the lowest value on offer to select.Seriously, I felt like asking my money back at the cinema, this is a crock of s***.The characters are irritating and whiny and the movie is boring. A load of people walking around in woods with a video camera.There is nothing remotely scary about this movie - Horror movie no, horrible movie yes.",1,4,9,19 January 2019
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Ok but we'll overrated
",I thought this was overrated as a child and I still do. It's an ok movie but is not a great movie by any means.,6,0,9,22 December 2019
Hot Fuzz," Brilliant
","I enjoyed it even more than Shaun of the Dead, this is brilliant. The show stealer is Timothy Dalton as the evil Simon Skinner, a superb turn by Dalton. I am British so some of the p*** takes of the British Police will possibly be alien to none British viewers, this still though is top comedy.",10,1,1,26 May 2019
The Terminator," Classic
",Great movie. The story was original and the movie executed to perfection. The main launch pad for Arnie this was. This movie puts Sci Fi movies made now in the shade if you can look past the special effects from the 80's.,10,2,3,9 April 2020
Snatch," Brilliant
",Loved this. Solid plot with great characters and lots of humour. I liked the way they joined the story up showing the exploits of different groups of characters play out. Excellent movie.,10,0,1,25 July 2019
Elf," Not great
",I'm clearly in a minority but this is way overrated. I don't think Will Ferrell helped I just find him more irritating than funny. Classic this is not.,1,3,18,15 December 2019
Shutter Island," Very good
","Really enjoyed this one. It was obvious there was going to be some twist but not obvious what twist that was. Good movie, well acted by an excellent cast.",10,0,1,22 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Decent
",I was dreading it but it wasn't as bad as I'd expected. This is way better than the crock of s*** called The Last Jedi. It ties up slot of loose ends. Nice way to sign off the series.,7,2,16,1 June 2020
The Village," Boring cr@p
","I'll cut to the chase. This movie bored me alot. The acting is good and the storyline original, it really should have been more exciting.There is nothing about this movie that kept me intrigued, a very disappointing movie.",1,1,7,13 January 2019
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Brilliant movie
","Great movie, certainly one of the greatest sequels on par with Aliens. Great story, great acting and brilliant action scenes. Made in 1991 and the special effects are still excellent as I type this review in 2020. Fabulous movie.",10,0,0,2 January 2020
Face_Off," Excellent
","Classic 90's action movie, easily one of the best from the nineties. Original plot that yes is highly improbable and over the top, but this movie delivers solid entertainment. Loved it.",10,1,2,13 October 2019
28 Days Later...," Very very good
",Not your average zombie apocalyptic movie. This is genuinely frightening and believable. Probably more of a cult classic purely as it's a low budget British movie and not a Hollywood production. Quality movie.,10,0,0,6 December 2019
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Would be higher than a 7 but...
","Overall a very good movie. Plenty of action, a good fun action movie. I think this movies rating suffers because of these key points:<ul><li>taking the T-Rex to San Diego sucked. They should have kept the action on the island.</li><li>disappointing they only retained two original cast members in Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough.</li><li>too much focus in the T-Rex.</li></ul>",7,0,0,31 May 2020
School of Rock," Overrated
","This is well overrated, one I definitely will not watch again.I found Jack Blacks effort at humour very forced. Not a great comedy.",3,3,10,12 April 2019
The Game," Excellent
",I thought this was excellent in 1997 and I still do in 2019. Very well acted with an original plot and a nice twist. Clever and suspenseful movie full or paranoia. Top movie this one.,10,1,2,26 December 2019
Ghostbusters," Legendary
","Brilliant 80's comedy. Yes the special effects are dated, but that doesn't tarnish this movie. Great fun.",10,2,2,24 October 2019
Gran Torino," Excellent
","Top movie. Great acting, solid story. One of Clints finest.",10,1,1,9 April 2019
Million Dollar Baby," Fabulous but tragic
","Brilliant movie. Original story, great acting and directing. Uplifting but tragic.",10,0,2,9 April 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Complete car crash. .. Awful. SPOILERS... read them if you wish to save yourself.
","If you're a fan of the Star Wars saga who at least expects these new movies to stick to Star Wars lore that has gone before, then this will make you sick.This movie could have and should have been excellent, unfortunately it was butchered. You'll find below some reasons why I believe this movie stinks:<ul><li>Luke Skywalker: His character has been turned into a miserable, sour faced a'** hole.</li><li>Rey: Five minutes training and now she's a super powerful Jedi!!!! MARY SUE.</li><li>Lea: Floating in space withtout any protective suit. Yes she has the Force but it's not THAT powerful.</li><li>Snork: What a waste of good character. They killed him off far to early and far to easily.</li><li>Yodas Jedi ghost: He brings down powerful lightening. If Jedi ghosts can do this,t hen why didn't Obi Wans Jedi ghost kill the emperor in the original trilogy.</li></ul>Essentially this movie relies on special effects, a real let down.Disney is the death of Star Wars.",1,15,20,20 July 2018
Jerry Maguire," Average
",There are some funny moments and some good lines bit there is nothing great about this movie. Certainly not iconic. It's not total crap but nothing more than average. Overrated for sure,5,0,2,6 September 2019
Mission: Impossible II," Badly underrated movie
","Seriously it's actually a good action movie, it gets some criticism on but it I liked it. Great action and scenery. It pioneers the mask that has been used in many of the following movies. If it has a weakness the storyline is probably it, that said it doesn't badly affect the movie. The casts good and they carry the movie well. Give it a chance.",8,2,4,30 December 2019
The Dark Knight," I haven't seen a better super hero movie
","Excellent on every level, you can't fault this one. An iconic super hero against and iconic villain both played to perfection although the latter does upstage Batman for sure. Great movie.",10,1,1,25 October 2019
Reservoir Dogs," Pile of s***
","It stinks it really does.Nothing but a load of talk and a bloodbath. Overrated movie in my opinion, surprised it seems so popular.There are plenty of better crime movies out there. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time with this movie.",1,1,4,20 February 2020
The Descent," Jumpy horror
","Very good effort on a low budget. Just shows you don't need to spend a fortune to make a good production. The storylines original and it delivers exactly what you expect, creepy jumpy horror moments.",8,0,0,15 March 2020
Pulp Fiction," Very overrated
","This movie gets some hype. I personally found it boring, nothing but a load of pointless conversations.",1,0,5,13 October 2019
War of the Worlds," Very good
","I surprised with this, half expecting something terrible it turned out to be very good. The special effects are great and there is plenty of action.If there is any negative, there wasn't anything in the way of character development. Saying that it thankfully doesn't harm this movie.What I liked the most about this is it's not boring at all. It doesn't mess around with any slow burning s***, it just gets into action.I am surprised it gets such a kicking on ImDb.",8,1,4,28 July 2019
Con Air," Very good action movie
","Nicholas Cages best movie next to The Rock. Although he was completely upstaged by an excellent John Malkovich.This plots solid, the action is great. Yes it's cheesy and over the top, but that comes with the territory for any action movie.This is good fun, I enjoyed watching.",8,0,0,4 August 2019
It Chapter Two," Disappointing
","I was really disappointed with this. Part 1 was very good, sadly this is not. I found myself getting bored after a while. It's not as creepy as I expected.",4,1,1,19 January 2020
Jaws," An all time great
",One of Spielberg's finest. Pure suspense and it was on a low budget. Still stands up today.,10,1,4,24 December 2019
Halloween," Legendary
",The benchmark for slasher films still and any horror in general. Overall a great horror movie. Authentic and haunting. Love it.,10,0,1,14 November 2019
Tombstone," Excellent western. A tribute to the genre.
","I wasn't sure what to expect before watching this, considering the classic westerns it would be measured against.This movie stands up to any of those classic old Western movies it is excellent.The casting is spot on and they play their characters great - especially Val Kilmer, a career best for him, superb.The movie is nicely paced and the action scenes well staged, you can really feel the tension between the characters when Wyatt Earp and his gang face off against the cowboys.If you've read poor reviews of this movie, ignore, watch it then make your own mind up. I suspect even none lovers of the Western genre would enjoy this.As far as Westerns go I a enjoyed this as much as any past greats.",10,1,2,28 December 2018
Signs," Different but good
","Going by the IMDb score, then I'll go on record and say this movie is underrated.It's certainly not your standard Sci Fi alien invasion movie, but it's full of tension and gives the viewer an insight into how the impending invasion effects a family and how they deal with it.Definitely one of Mel Gibson's better efforts.",8,1,3,19 January 2019
The Truman Show," Very good
",I really enjoyed this. Jim Carey is obviously famous for comedy but he shines here. The story was clever and the movie was nicely played out. You really feel sorry for Truman.,10,0,0,31 July 2019
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Classic.. very underatted
","Excellent fun, some people need to grow a sense of humour.",10,1,2,10 August 2019
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Best of the bunch
","Great movie, loads of action. Connery and Ford bounce off each other to brilliant effect.",10,0,0,2 January 2020
Goodfellas," Excellent, better than The Godfather
",Excellent gangster movie based on real life characters and events. This and not the Godfather is what a gangster movie looks like.Great watch.,10,1,2,31 May 2019
The Godfather," Boring
","A cure for Insomnia, a boring movie. Not worthy of being labelled 'great'.",1,4,15,28 January 2019
