Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great episode, but not as good as the old trilogy...
","This new Star Wars episode was fantastic, but I did not find it as good as the old trilogy. However, I did like this episode very much. I think that anyone that likes any sort of action movie would be pleased with this movie. It also had plenty of fantasy - it took place in a different galaxy and it had very advanced technology. It has many different battles going on, especially in the end - a space battle, a sword battle, a gun battle, and a war. It has a good storyline, and once you see the first episode, you'll be wanting to see them all. It also had some amazing creatures, such as the gungans. These creatures that they created were great - you need a lot of imagination to create characters like those. Well, that's about it. If you would like a movie with even more action, check for episodes two and three.",8,5,7,7 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Great way to end series & the best episode of all...
","This episode of Star Wars had to be the best episode of them all. It was an excellent way to end the series - a climactic last episode. All of the pieces of the puzzle are put together. It had action like never before. There was a sword battle, a space battle, and a war - all going on at the same time. In the end, what a great way to destroy the evil emperor. Finally, Luke and his father are on the same side again - the light, not the dark. It was all about how all of these people from the rebel alliance interacted with each other in order to defeat the empire. I do not see who would not like to see this movie, so I recommend this to anyone.",10,1,2,8 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Lots of action, but love story in the background...
","I did not like this movie as much - to much action for me. Also, there was a stupid love story in the background. It's the same way with almost all action movies - they ruin them with gooey love stories. As it got to the middle of the movie, a lot of action appeared as the clone army was built, but the love story ruined it. I would recommend this to people that like action films. This has the most action of the Star Wars series so far, so if you are someone that likes action, then go ahead and watch it, but if you absolutely hate love stories like me, then I would not recommend this movie to you. In the end, this movie had plenty of action, so if you like action, go ahead and watch it. If you hate action and love, then I wouldn't recommend it to you.",7,0,1,7 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," To much action...To much violence...To much love...
","I did not like this movie at all. It had way to much action for me. Now, most people love action and would say that I'm crazy, but when there is to much action, I do not like the movie. There was way to much violence in the movie. Anakin burning up - that was really not a necessary scene to the movie. I'm sure most people would get a good laugh about Anakin catching on fire, but I did not. I thought it was plain stupid. Once again, it had a stupid love story. Anakin, falling in love with Padme and turning to the dark side to protect her. I wonder if he knows that if he hadn't turned to the dark side, that Padme would have been saved. Well that's all that I'm going to say. I think I'v tortured this episode enough.",4,0,4,7 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Good movie...
","Star Wars episode four was an excellent movie. It had a lot of action in it. It did not have as much as the new trilogy did, but still, it had just the right amount of action. There were definitely a lot of good parts in this movie, and it was a great way to start out the Star Wars series. But still, how did it start out? You'll have to see it all in the new trilogy that George Lucas is coming out with. It won't be as good, but it will explain everything well. This episode actually had pretty good graphics. Outer Space actually looked like outer space. Also, if you like sci-fi movies (fantasy), then this is for you. It takes place millions of years ago in a different galaxy with advanced technology and a power known as the force that controls what happens. Well, that's about it. I would recommend this movie to anyone at all. I don't see how anyone could dislike this movie.",10,0,0,8 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Great sequel to episode 4...
","Episode four Star Wars was a great movie. This sequel made Star Wars even better. It seems that the longer this series goes on, the more action in the movies! Once again, this movie was classic Star Wars. The newer movies got boring because there was to much action and violence. The old trilogy actually has some suspense and action both. The thing that everyone was surprised by was when Darth Vader said 'Luke, I am your father.' Everyone loved this line, and it will probably be repeated for many generations to come. We'll never forget it. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes action or suspense in movies, because this had plenty of both. That's all folks...",10,0,1,8 June 2006
