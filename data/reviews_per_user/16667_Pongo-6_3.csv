The Blair Witch Project," Not for everybody
","While this is a good movie if you like to analyze movies, whether you know what you're doing or not, it's not for most people -- especially those expecting (any) special effects.  Even though it's short, some of my fellow theater-goers were bored after an hour and laughed at times when the tension should have been getting thicker.  I suspect that most viewers will be annoyed by the hand-held cameras (there's not a single still-shot in the entire show), think that it's too slow, and won't really find it frightening at all.",7,1,1,1 August 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Good movie with a great score
","Saw Sleepy Hollow at a press screening last night at Paramount.  In light of the trailer (which I thought was ho-hum), my impression that Burton films generally are overacted and border on cartoonish or comic book-ish, and (especially) the cheesy 'heads will roll' tagline, I was expecting a pretty mediocre show.  In the end, though, I thought it was good.  There is a little bit of silliness (e.g., head spinning around after being cut off) and one or two too-cartoonish effects (to mention would be to spoil), but overall I think the movie stays away from such things -- which for me is a good thing.  Generally, I think it was well acted too.  My rave for this movie, though, is the Danny Elfman score, which is awesome.  The sound effects were also very good and, as always, Burton does an incredible job of providing a dark and dreary backdrop to a story.  I'm not too sure about some of the character development (or lack thereof), particularly with regard to the characters played by Christina Ricci and Miranda Richardson, but in the end I didn't really mind.",6,0,0,12 November 1999
American Pie," Decent movie if you're in the mood
","This is exactly as the trailers suggested, except with even a little bit more plot than I expected.  If you like crude sex-related humor, it's well worth the money.Warning: The AMC I went to was carding and turning away the poor 15-year-old girls who tried to get in.",7,0,0,18 July 1999
