The Blair Witch Project," Intense and very well made picture. EXCELLENT!!!
","I really enjoyed this movie. This is a very well made, well acted, enjoyable movie that gets even better after you have a few hours to think and talk about it.I was quite pleasantly surprised at the very genuine humor that is evident throughout the first part of the film.  Then as the tone darkened and things began to go wrong, the movie kept me quite focused and frightened until the last scene (which was, by the way, PERFECTLY done).I really think that Blair Witch will do for the woods what Jaws did for the beach and Psycho did for seedy roadside motels and showers.  And I as I told my husband, I am NOT going camping any time soon.  Especially not anywhere near Maryland. grin",10,1,2,23 July 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Best Comedy I've seen all year!!
","I didn't really know what to expect when I went to see South Park.  I have watched the TV show some, and it is funny, but I never got caught up in South Park mania.I am pleased to say that I loved this movie.  I can't wait to see it again. The satire was dead on target and so timely it almost appears that the movie was made in the last month and a half or so.While the entire movie was awesome, I especially loved the Star Wars references and the scene with Bill Gates (I won't spoil it for those who haven't yet seen the movie, but definitely watch for it.  If you have ever had a computer crash, you'll appreciate it.)",10,0,0,9 July 1999
Pitch Black," Excellent Movie with amazing amount of depth
",I was amazed at how good this movie really was.  I expected a typical monster alien thrillfest.  I was delighted to find that it is a movie of extreme depth about the redemption of a human soul.  This is a movie which surprised me and that doesn't happen very often.  It flouts convention and presents characters that are quite well rounded especially for this genre.  I feel that this is one of the best movies of the year and a must see for everyone who enjoys either a good sci-fi flick or a powerful drama about the inner workings of the human mind.,9,0,0,16 May 2000
Raging Bull," Boring....Over-rated!!
","I fail to understand why so many people consider this to be such a good movie.  I was bored stiff with it from the very start.  Martin Scorsese should send me a check to cover the time I wasted watching it (okay, he can deduct about 15 minutes because I fell asleep toward the end, just couldn't stay awake).  A more accurate name for it would be 'Raging Bull-S***'I am not really sure what Scorsese was trying to say with this picture, but if he wanted me to feel that Jake La Motta was an interesting or worthwhile human being, he failed dismally.  About all I got was that La Motta was a complete waste of oxygen.  If that was his point, okay, but I think I could have conveyed that in about 15 min and then gone on with my life.The truly sad part about this movie is how much talent (DeNiro, Pesci, and Scorsese himself) was wasted to create it.",1,25,67,1 July 1999
