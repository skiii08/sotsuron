The Monuments Men," Untold story of WWII
","As a WWII history buff I have seen a heck of a lot of movies of that genre. But this is an intriguing story that to my knowledge has never been told on the big screen. Maybe that's why I could easily overlook some of its flaws and found it thoroughly enjoyable. The horrible reviews kept me from seeing it in the theater, but I think a number of the critics didn't 'get' what the movie was about. Yes, it's a retro vehicle, but it had a number of clever lines and genuinely tense moments. War is like that — there's humor right alongside death and tragedy. Clooney, Murray and Goodman were their usual entertaining selves. Anyone who's likes WWII, classical art, Clooney and/or Murray will enjoy this film.",8,1,2,24 May 2014
The Birth of a Nation," Magnificent and Repulsive
","I'm not as cinematically sophisticated as most of the people who have reviewed this film, but I would like to make two points:1. It's hard to believe this film is 100 years old. It flows like a modern movie from beginning to end. When viewing it, I made the initial adjustment to it being a silent film in a very short time, and after that, I was just caught up in the plot and flow. Griffith had no panning, no zooming and very few long shots or close ups. Practically every scene was done in medium shot — and obviously there's no dialog — but the film is put together so well that I hardly noticed its 'old-fashioned' quality.2. The film is unbelievably racist. Unbelievably! Hey, I knew it was racist before watching it, but I never never dreamed it would be as bad as it was. It makes a person's heart ache to think that people really were — and are — that bigoted. It is so tragic that such a brilliant, well-made film had such an obnoxious message.Both of the above points are reasons for people to watch this movie today. In a nutshell, TBOAN shows that Griffith was a true genius as a film maker, but also how deeply entrenched the roots of racism are in American society.",8,1,4,12 February 2014
