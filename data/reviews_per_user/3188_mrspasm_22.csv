Ghost," Scariest Films Of Al Times
","I feel that I should warn anyone who was attracted to watching this movie by the name alone- This is not just a horror film- It's the most terrifying, mind crushingly disturbing piece of art in history. After watching it I spiralled into a foul pit of depression for 17 weeks in which I spoke to no-one, said nothing, went nowhere, and felt only the knowledge of my own impending doom rushing inevitably towards me from all angles. I was enclosed in a tomb of hatred, an OLAP cube filled with emptiness, nine inch nails driven into my very soul my eyeless creatures whose only joy is ill-gained by their concentrated torture of the insane. There was not exactly darkness, but there was an all encompassing absence of light, of life, or breath; it was like existing inside the dying lung of a smoker, like swallowing cement, like choking yourself with the cold feet of a dead neighbour. Imagine a dream where you lose your shoes and have to tie Jennifer Lopez and Andie McDowell to your feet just so that you can push Bernie Mac up a vertical cliff face in a barrel.After a few weeks I began to have visions of a new world filled with creatures called Burlapians in which I was an Alien slave recently released. Everyone spat on me as I walked by, and I wasn't allowed to enter a Burlapian caf√© for a caramel square. Soon my despair began to manifest itself as boils on the inside of my eyeballs. These boils burst, sending my eyes out of my now devastated carcass of a face, and onto the floor. Born from the boils of my despair was another race of miniature creatures which I named Rubtuckuryans as I was delirious from the pain. I couldn't see them as my eyes were lost, and even now I doubt their existence, but I felt that they were there and that they were mine, and so I commanded them. If you have never felt the sensation of 14 million little men running over your skin then let me tell you it is among the most exhilarating and revitalising experiences of my life. For the first time in my life I was at one with a larger society. I was their leader, but more than that I was them and they were me. I was worshipped from all quarters as God, Mother, and Saviour, but by the Burlapian classes as a creature to be derided and shoved. One afternoon when the town was asleep, I sent my 14 million little soldiers on their first and final mission; one of which none could be certain of coming home. They entered the houses of each Burlapian and wreaked the most horrific forms of vengeance ever imagined. I felt sick at the carnage created by my hand. Sick with joy. Sick with sickness. There were many casualties, but the few survivors who stumbled back to me no longer felt a part of me. They had committed such acts that I could no longer fathom their existence and so I screamed to the heavens and launched myself of the nearest mountain top. I hit the bottom at around 150 miles per hour and splashed beautifully across the gray wilderness. At last I was happy and free. I could now come back to life. I woke with a start to find I had grown a bushy yet stylish beard and some odd bacteria between my toes. The TV license people assumed I was dead and so no longer send me a bill. So everything worked out in the end.If you wish to avoid such a trauma then go watch The Exorcist or another less harrowing horror movie. This is too much. The way the hands merge with the clay, the way the spirits come screaming from the shadows to claim the newly dead souls as their own, ripping from our world onto the next, Whoopee Goldberg. Not for the faint hearted; not for anyone. A movie made by Frank after opening the box.Best Scene: When Swayze is trying to jump through a wall but he doesn't realise that ghosts are perfectly sold molecular creatures like the rest of us and he breaks his neck smashing into it.",10,1,4,26 July 2009
Spartacus," Poignant and bleak
","Spartacus is a documentary about one man, a slave of some sort, and his struggle for respect and freedom. 'Why do you mock us?' he shouts 'We are men too. All we want are the same rights and privileges as everyone else'. Unfortunately for Spartacus, him and his friends are quite dirty, and in the olden days that was not good. I'm not sure when this was made- the clothes are obviously quite old, and there aren't any cars, but I'm a bit confused as all films before 1977 were black and white (with the odd exception). I'm pretty sure there were cars in 1976, maybe just not in the country this was filmed. Either way, it's a stark reminder of how lucky we are today as dirty people have the same rights as the rest of us, and some even go on to fame and riches after showing their dirt on 'reality TV shows'.The filmmaker follows the life of Spartacus from his days as a famous boxer- 500 fights all wins by KO is quite a record, even by today's standards. We see some stock footage of his most famous fights- beware, some of these are quite gruesome and all the more scary as we know they were real. I would have liked some interviews with the fighters and the managers, and perhaps some fans, but alas no. Maybe this will be included in future video releases. After a period of civil war or something- journalists weren't allowed into the country so about 10 years of Sparky's life are missing, we find our hero has lost his job and his money like many did, and has now resorted to slavery. 'Shine your sandals, ma'am?' we hear him cry. 'Scrub out yer barn, squire?' It's a sad story of how the great can fall. I though the documentary would end here, perhaps with a closing line about the futility of dreams, and that even great success can come crumbling down in an instant. But no, something surprising happened, which showed me the true quality of the man. Sparktickus decided he wanted to reclaim his former glory; he wasn't ready for the scrap heap just yet; he would be great again and if the government tried to stop him he would cause a rebellion. He gathers his former boxing friends as well as other slaves (presumably to make up numbers) and attempts to form a new boxing/wrestling/mixed martial arts league. I thought again that the documentary would end, with Sparky set up as a hero, an inspiration to all slaves and faded celebrities, perhaps with a closing line about the greed and desire of celebrity culture, but also the human touch and what even the smallest mind can accomplish with a strong will. Another surprise- it goes on, and the King decides that he has had enough of this little rebellion. He sends out all his armies to find Sparky and it is at this point the filmmakers really should have stepped in. They could have brought him and his friends to America and fame after the success of the film. But no, they lazily stand by and watch as our friends are literally ripped to shreds, and their heads put on posts down the motorway. The camera fades to black.This is one of the most stark endings I've ever seen, and of course as we all know it actually happened. I'm torn as to how I should feel about this film. Yes, the film makers do a great job of showing Sparky's life and how terrible people can be, but they went too far. Surely they could have avoided any pretentious nonsense about 'the camera showing truth' and 'not interfering with nature'. I mean these weren't spiders we were dealing with, they were people! A good documentary, but very long, and considering the ending you may want to stop an hour before the end and pretend it all ended OK.Favourite scene: When Sparky is training another young fighter by running along the beach. The camera fades to slow motion as they cross the line, and then jump into the surf in their shorts and frolic about, flicking water etc. Poignant.",8,1,5,26 May 2009
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Imagine One Hundred And One Anythings Humping Your Leg!
","As a monkey lover (not like that you dirty boy! Lol!) I have trouble watching films about animals which don't feature monkeys. After overcoming this initial disappointment, I sat down to watch this Walter Dizzy classic. The story is about a family who have a hundred Dalmation dogs (the ones which look like zebras) and are entering the American version of Crufts- 'The Abe Lincoln Sponsored Stars And Stripes Canine Appreciation Gala Contest Bonanza For Dog Breeders Featuring Exciting Races, Daring Obstacles, Grooming Awards, And Stalwart Obedience Show!' or better known as TALSSASCAGCBFDBFERDOGAASOS! The family hear about a loophole that if someone has 101 dogs of the same breed they automatically win the top prize- the Woofey, and a million one dollar bits. Their dogs are mongrels you see- stupid, ugly, and disobedient. The first part of the show is taken up with the family trying to train their dogs to sit, sleep, run, eat, dance, and sing- this leads to some wonderful hits such as 'Spot The Wrong'un!', 'Who Let The Dogs Out', 'Barken', 'Oh What A Lovely Bone' and 'Get Off My Nice Clean Carpet You Dirty Bitch'. Realising their dogs are useless they try to exploit the loop. Most of the film is taken up by the owners and their lovely children trying to get their puppies to mate so that they reach the target of 101- this led to some questionable scenes which young audiences were not prepared for and the eventual 'disappearances of many of the staff. 40 years later a mass burial site was exhumed where a number of bodies of the staff were found- some with bones inserted in the wrong spot (pardon the puns). Bette Davis spices things up a tad with her portrayal of Cruel Fella D'Evil- a local mobster who went mental when her husband was murdered by the Godfather, Don Niro De Pachinko. She hates the sound of dogs, but loves the taste, and has heard an ancient myth which speaks of 'the flysh of the one hundred and first born pup shall give eternal life to he who shalt feast of it'. She tries to kidnap number 101 (Ploppy) and eat it, but the other dogs set traps up for her around the house, such as messes under the windows, messes on the hallways, and worst of all, messes on the door handles. I won't spoil the ending for you, but it ends by the plot coming to and end and the credits rolling. Although this was filmed about a hundred (and one!) years ago, the graphics and camera-work are very enticing. Disney were the only studio rich enough back then to make their films in colour, which is why this looks so could compared to other rubbish like Castle Blanka. Unfortunately the unsavoury nature of the plot combined with the toilet humour, and the fact that it was basically a remake of the Nazi propaganda film 'Eine hundert und eine Rettungen' or 101 Salvations mean that it makes for inappropriate viewing. Best Scene: Fred Willard's humorous commentary throughout the various stages of the dog trials- it was one of his first appearances, at the age of 42.",5,0,10,25 May 2010
Underworld," Sexy Becksy!
","Ever since Buffy came along and made everything cool again we have had an influx of three separate related things: 1. Movies starring a strong, independent female kick ass character (Aliens, Valley of The Dolls, Underworld). 2. Cool vampire movies with cool characters and cool vampires (Blade, Razor Blade Smile, Underworld). 3. Movies and shows which blend horror and comedy creating what I call 'Hilarious Screamers', such as Scream, Ugly Betty, and Underworld. Now, underworld is slightly different in that is disbands the humour and plays everything very straight laced (and leather clad). Most hilarious screamers aren't very funny anyway and it is probably a good idea that this is more like an action drama horror. Everything is dark and cool, rainy and gloomy, blue and atmospheric.Kip Beckinsale plays a vampire who has been at war with Werewolves (the technical terms is lichen) for centuries- since the time of The Vikings and when there used to be Greeks. She is one of many, working day and night (apart from day time) to stop the war boiling over into human land. One day a man is accidentally bitten by a werewolf and will turn in a few days. However, there is something special about his blood or something and he is able to waken an ancient vampire monster who will end the world. The plot was very complexicated and I can't really remember too much. To be honest I was too busy googling at Baxendale's chests in her leather. The story never really matters in films anyway, as long as there are plenty of guns and killing, and perhaps some excitements then it is a classic masterpiece. There is lots of action here, with guns, steaks, vampire vs werewolf fights, chases etc. The graphics are very nice too, better than the computer game. Beckinsdale is a good vampire, but I think that Buffy would beat her up in a normal fight. She is only a normal vampire with ordinary powers, and considering Buffy has beaten The Master, Dracula, Glory (a God!) and hundreds of uber-vamps, I don't think Becks would have a chance. She does have lots of guns though, but in a straight fight that would be cheating. Overall this is a nice film to watch after a Sunday roast- just don't have too much garlic or the TV might switch itself off! Incrementally, the film is named after the knicker making factory from Coronation Street- The Director's favourite show! Best Scene: I liked the way Backonsale jumped off rooftops onto the streets below. This is something I also enjoy- roaming the streets in the moonlight, climbing up onto Church steeples and watching the world go by underneath. Sometimes I dress up like her too.",8,3,5,7 September 2009
Kickboxer," The Muscles From Belgium Kicks Exposed Bums!
","Yes, now we're into the realms of classic masterpieces! One of John Claud Van Damne's early films, Kickboxer has it all- fighting. Jean Cloud stars as Luc 'kickboxer' Deveroux, a fighter who wants to travel to China and enter a deadly Marshall Arts contest. His brother, Luke Deveroux was meant to go but as he was an unknown actor they decided to send Vin Darn instead. Off he goes, wearing nothing as always to make sure the female, gay, and curious portion of the audience get to drool over his well oiled, muscular and inviting buttocks. Soon he is being trained by a wizened old genius in the ways of kick boxing. He kicks empty cardboard boxes, flat packs, dodges boxes filled with ripe fruit and veg, and eats cardboard all day. The middle section of the film is simply various montages of this type of behaviour, showing his skills improving until he can do the splits balancing on top of a hundred stacked milk cartons. We also see him shaking his thang at a local bar, entrancing the local woman and igniting them into a sexual frenzy. Luckily when they approach he snaps their necks with swift roundhouse kicks. Thus he is ready for the tournament. Many fighters from around the globe and beyond have come to fight and win. We have Bolo from China, a sumo wrestler from Japan, a Viking from Norway, a funny little crab like creature from Africa, and various others, each with a unique fighting style. Shaun Claw Damn Van progresses through each round, beating everyone easily. In the final he has to fight a hard looking transvestite who trains by kicking holes in car doors and eating concrete. JCVCDVD beats him after a gruelling ten rounds by punching him in the nuts so hard that she/he becomes a he/she. We celebrate with a fist pumping 80s power ballad, possibly called 'Don't Let The Cardboard Box You In (Keep Believing, Little Boy)!'Best Scene: When the Sumo sits on the little crab man and laughs, and you see all the arms and limbs underneath frantically flailing around, then stretching climactically, then trembling softly, then stopping. Always stopping.",10,0,0,8 January 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," You'd better start believing in ghosts, girly- You're In One!
","This excitement film ups the auntie from the first film with more fights, more explodings, and more Captain Blark! Yes, John Deep excels again in his pirate costume, running through fields, being chased by crazy Caribbean people, swinging his sword, drinking his whiskey, and generally being great. The King's Army are after him due to the incidents of the first film, so he has sailors coming at him from all directions! Also in addition to this Davey Jones is after him for some reason- he is a monster man, a dead man and he wants to suck Captain Blark into his chest, hence the title. At the other side of the world Orlando Bloomer and Kylie Knightly have get married and are on a quest to find a mystical treasure which will bring them riches and peace and prove that Bloom is fit to be King. This quest brings them back into contact with Blark, and all the sailors, monsters, pirates, dead men, beasties, skeletons, fish, Blarks, and zombies collide in one epic battle. A GIANT sea monster appears, sent by Davey and it wrecks all the ships and eats our hero. The rest of the people and freaks manage to finally scare the monster away and thus begins the race to get the treasure.Gore Verbinski gives homage to his favourite movies here- indeed it is really his version of Cannonball Run except on the hi seas. Each character has their own ship- some are small and cut through the waves quickly. Others are big and slow, but have lots of weapons to stop the faster ship. The Boulder Brothers ship turns out to be quite disastrous though as it is built from rock and sinks like a stone. Bloomer and Knight reach the treasure but it turns out to be a trap! By touching it, Bloom switches bodies with Blark, is sent down to the ship of the dead where he must spend eternity, rowing the ocean floor in search of Sea Doughnuts. We get a glimpse of his father who will become a major character in the final film, while Blark is transported to a giant never-ending beach (This may be a subtle reference to the Desert in Steve King's Big Tower series). Better than the first two films, but not as good as the last few.Best Scene: When Blark is chatting up some sea-prostitutes and says 'Oh my, my dear, what a lovely set of coconuts you yield in thine corset' and all 14 of them take turns to slap him! 'You try wearing a Corbet!'",9,0,1,11 June 2009
X-Men," Is it a bird? Is it a spider? Yes, it's the X-Men!
","This film is based on the lives of America's greatest heroes the X-Men, men and women who were both experimented on and exposed to radioactive radiation and subsessfully their cells changed them into freaks. The American government ran these tests in secrecy in the hope to make an army of super soldiers who could attack the Germans and French in the First World War between 1970-1952. The Government hoped to give one man the powers of a spider, one the powers of a bat, one the powers of a superintendent etc. Of course things went wrong and they all escaped into hiding. The natural human DNA meant that good people stayed good and didn't want to fight the English, while the bad humans went worse and decided to gang up and destroy the world. This is why there are bad and good guys. Any time you see a film or book or TV with goodies and bad guys it is because of this incident, known as the Holy Resolution. This was mostly a secret until one of the robots (Auptocop I think) befriended a young boy called Stanley and told him his story. Stanley decided to write comics for a living when he grew up, and thus comics were born.The X-Men is one of Stanley's most famous and least known works having been turned into a book, a play, an ice theatre, a series of TV series and a series of movies. There have been countless toys, posters, Cd's featuring all our favourite X-ers singing in their favourite styles- Wolfy sings Death Metal, X-Wafer sings Morissey covers, Storm sings Naked R'n'B, Jean Gay just cries for 3 minutes, Gandalf does prog-country, Rogue sings Blues songs about rapin' and a killin', Ham-bit does reggae, Debbie does Dallas, and Memento sings old Shakespeare bits but in rapping couplets. You get the idea. Of course there are plenty of action figures and other junk; top tramps playing cards, vehicles, games for your home video game entertainment computer system (the one for the Nintendy Segi-box in 1984- a rolling beat you up is a particle favourite), posters, bed quilts, condoms featuring Humphry Jackman's face on them, bubbly gum, guns, gum shields, gun shields, paint, ladders, mp3 players, diapers shaped like Captain Jean Luc Pickal's head, phones and answering machines, and of course staples.This is the first movie based on the comic which was based on the real events of the second World War which was in turn based on the Vietnam war. Stanley pops up in the film as a young boy being crushed to death by a tree (sadly this actually occurred and Stanley is still alive). The film shows some of the histories of some of the main characters, but I was quite annoyed that Superman wasn't in it. He could have just punched all the bad guys across to India! Anyway, Magenta wants revenge for something that happened once and he tries to recruit Wolfy and Raque as they are very strong. He wants as many X-Men as possible so that he can turn the Statue of Liberty into a giant Sentinel which will then crush all the cities of America meaning he will become rich and indestructionable. Some of the fights and excitements here are second to none, second only to the second film which has scenes which are second to none, except when comparing them to those in the first. The fight on top of Her Majesty Liberty is a good, and when the statue comes alive and walks through New York it look like nothing can stop them. She eventually climbs the Entire State Building and is about to eat everyone inside when Slimer (being carried in Rogue's bra) jumps out and leaves a trail of slime around the top so Liberty loses her grip and falls into the ocean, carrying all the bad X-ers with her. Hooray! But will they return for a sequel? Probably not! One extra note- the music here is very good, written by Jon Willyams and merging his previous scores from other superhero movies like Big, Transformers, and The Princley Bride.Best Scene: When Wolfmarine is fighting Beastor with trees- it's like Croucing Tiger, Hiding Lager but with 200 foot redwoods being swung around instead of swords. It is truly a sight to behead!",8,0,1,20 July 2009
Silent Hill," Silent But Diddly!
","Silent Hill is based on the computer game of the same name- Quiet Hill. I've never played it but I hear that actually this film is based on bits from all of the games, most notable the scene where you enter the sewers and are attacked by hordes of giant spiders. That was very scary in the game, but not scary et al here because it doesn't actually happen.A woman loses her daughter in a scary town and decides to go looking for her. The town in covered by a spooky fog, and everything is very quiet. She enters the town, while her husband tries to catch up with her a few miles behind. In the town she is attacked by zombies, people with shovels for heads, nurses with bandages for eyes, and wasps with guns for their mouths. She realises that it is all a cult where the children are burned in giant statues made of hay- hence all the smoke and fog in the town. Her daughter is going to be burned and it is a race against time to save her. The interesting part is that only certain times of the day can the monsters come out- a copy of Dracula. When the clocks strikes she knows she'd better hide as that is when the monsters (known in the game as cenobots) come out to play and eat! It gets even more interesting as the husband comes to the town but finds it completely deserted, so we don't know if it is all a dream, or if she is dead, or if he is dead, or if anything is what it seems. The acting is mostly good, and Mr Bean does a good job of playing a serious role for once rather than the slap stick comedy he is used to. The mum (played by Peggy Mitchell)is the latest in a long line of strong female heroines, starting with Buffy. If it had been Buffy, she would have no doubt contacted Giles, worked out what was going down, and fought her way through the bad guys, quipping as she went. There are a few scary moments (like when the woman wonders if she should look into the dirty bath water or not) but I think it would have been better if it had been a Zelda game instead. Imagine watching Link riding Epona out of the forest of his home and out onto a massive Hyrule field, with a score of enemies coming towards him. It would be great to see all the sword fights, but also the boomerang and hookshot too. Silent Hill is one of my favourite games, and this film does the game justice as it doesn't make any sense but has good graphics.Best Scene- When the wife is walking between all the scary nurses, trying not to breathe or touch them or they'll stab her. One of them farts and she tries not to laugh and be sick. This was completely inappropriate and horrifying.",6,0,0,2 July 2009
Little Miss Sunshine," Comic genius and wisdom genius!
","I usually don't like this sort of film, but I do like comedies so I thought I would give it a go. I'm glad I did because this film is a Little Ray Of Sunshine! It is SO funny and SO clever! I haven't laughed this hard since the fat woman in that Greek Wedding film walked away with her headphones on and hurt her neck! I had a trouser incident that time, and there were many more brown moments here! Listen to my words: This film is about a family who go for a drive across the world so that they can take their daughter (son?) to a Beautiful Contest. Boring huh? Where are the guns and killings and explodings and head bustings!? Let me finish, idiot. The thing is- the wee girl isn't a pretty one! Yet she enters this competition to win with her beauty! That was a soil. The best bit is, the rest of her family are strangoids two! The granda is an old man. Waiting to die you would think, mumbling on rusks and thinking about the good old days? WRONG! This film changes it by making the granda a sexy pest! He likes the beers, he likes the womans, and he loves the naughty words! You didn't see that coming and no, nor neither didn't I! It is SO clever and SO smart. There is a dad. Business man? WRONG! He is insecure and his wife wears the trousers! There is a mum? Housewife? WRONG! She wears the jeans because her husband likes bras! It is SO funny and SO cleverly. There is a teenage son. You would think he is a rowdy, chasing girls and shouting like a lout, and talking about sports and boobs and drinking bad juice!? WRONG for another time! It is SO clever because it changes it and does the thing that you don't expect by making him not speak. He actually wears black and reads books! What is this!? The family get into many japes as they fly across the planet in their converted school bus (what were they on when they wrote this- cheese!?). They eat in McDonalds and then drive off without paying. They go to a Toga party at a local University and the granda drinks all the wine so the jocks chase them away. The son falls in love with Pamela Anderson and tries to kidnap her at a book signing (he wraps her inside his toga). They keep finding a French cyclist in every town they visit and cause him humusing mishaps like opening the bus door so he cycles into it, or reversing over his skull while he gently rests in the forest. There are too many bits to mention so I'll stop. The bit where the police are looking at the dad and he walks with his head down so they can't see his face, but then he walks into a lamp post! The bit where the dad and granda are sleeping in the same bed and they put each other's hands between two pillows-except it's not pillows! I don't want to spoil anymore so watch it for yourself. The part where the teenage son gets so angry that after 70 minutes of not talking- he actually does actually talk. An amazing shock! The bit where the granda climbs inside a coffin but it is already occupied so he kicks the skeleton in the nuts! Eventually they get to some place that they were trying to get to (how ironic!) and the girl goes on stage. Rather than get all dressed up like the other women this film tricks you again by doing something different! I won't spoil it, but I'll say that it involves a long black wig, Trevor McDonald, a box of matches, and 12. It is just too amazing lee clever and funny, and too SMART for the average brain! The best film since sliced bread! Best Bit: There are too many! The bit when they are driving through the ice and the mum decides to lick the window but her tongue gets stuck, and the granda says 'Stick that tongue on me any day baby!' Ha ha ha ha heh heh heh hee ha ha HA HA HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!",1,3,8,23 June 2009
Edward Scissorhands," What do you call a man whose top is made from trees and who likes to throw cutlery from high buildings? Head Wood Sky Soar Pans! (edward scissorhands)
","Edward Scissorhands is a terrifying, grim fairy tale, the story of a deformed boy with scissors stapled onto his arms in the place of hands. It is a well known fact that Vinnie Price went buck nuts before he died, believing that he was a real mad scientist. He began experimenting on neighbourhood runaways, cutting them up and replacing their limbs with household appliances- he would sand off their feet and replace them with a couple of hairdryers, he scooped out their eyeballs and inserted Christmas lights, he ripped off their danglies and tied on glue guns. The list goes on, all I will say is that this is where radiohead got their name from. Tim Button, fresh from his success with his version of Batfink made enough money to make whatever film he wanted. He decided to base his next film on the continuing existence of one of Prince's creations- Edward. It is made all the more horrific by the fact that a love story is tacked on along with some rather sick slap-the-stick comedy.The film stars Julia Roberts as a suburban saleswoman. In a clear rip off of off Desperate Houses, all the women are sneaky, self interested pointlessly neighbour obsessed with lives so empty and meaningless that the only way to fill the void with something other than outright hatred for themselves is to spy on their equally vacuous mud dwellers. Julia decides one day to go up to the spooky castle at the bottom of her street to try to sell her magic beans there. Inside she finds (amongst an assortment of fetish, S and M torture devices) a lonely young man called Edward. He seems normal other than the fact that he has scissors for his hands and is a complete weirdo. Naturally Jaunty Depp was picked for the role. Judy takes him home to meet her family- husband Richard, son Barry, and daughter Winrunner Rideher. Eddie falls in love for Wineowner but she calls him a hippie and has an affair with local jock Rob Lowe. Jedward goes buck nuts and begins having visions of his daddy, Vinnie Jones who advises him to become an assassin. He does, and the rest of the film is a blood soaked snowstorm of necks being sliced, eyes being gouged (with the camera placed on the tip of the scissor for maximum effect), and limbs removed as Tom Button shows his utter disdain for everything wholesome; it is basically him saying that he wishes everyone would murder everyone else and leave him alone to draw his zany pictures. The worst thing is, when Ed gets paid he can't count or spend the money as he keeps accidentally ripping it up.The scene where he moves from house to house impaling and mauling all the pets is so awful I may well have invented it just so I don't have to remember it. The thing comes to a climax when the FBI come to take Edwood away and he holds Winoprah hostage at the top of his castle. Helicopters swoop around the pair while he has a slow motion fight with their propellers. He finally cracks and cuts off his beloved's head and legs and is subsequently shot to pieces by the Feds. As the sad music rises, Winnie's blood drops onto the floor and we fade to white.Best Scene: The ending where we fade back in to find that it is the future, and Wimpy is alive and well and a granny. Surgeons were able so sow her head and legs together with a thin strip of her torso, though her midriff is completely gone. She is telling her granddaughter this story (I assume the young girl was naughty and this is her horrific punishment). The child asks 'What happened to Ed, granny?' Winotebook replies 'Ed's dead, baby. Ed's dead' before racing off on her space age mobility cycle.",10,1,2,30 November 2009
Aliens," Not as good as first, incredibly dark.
","Riply Scott's prequel to this film was a tale of intergalactic terror. Seven friends and their Bumbling Side-kick Jones were travelling home after a long vacation when they encountered a monster. Hearing it's distress call, they let it board their ship, but rather than show its gratitude, it decided to kill off the friends one by one in a terrifying game of cat and monster. The survivors from that film appear again here, namely Captain Ridley and of course Jonesy our heroic side kick. Ridley wants revenge for the death of her friends and recruits a team of super tough marines (that's soldiers to the lay person) to go to their home planet and wipe out the monsters once and for all. This darker tone is in stark contrast to Riply Scott's original, and it continues throughout. This leads to a series of let downs- Jones disappears without explanation early in the film, without explanation so much of the comedy from the first film is lost. Add to this the lack of Cyborg Ash, whose little dance was a hilarious highlight of the first and there are few laughs to be found here. Bill Pullman's marine Ernie 'Dry Heat' Hudson attempts some improvised one liners 'Hey Vasquez- you look like a man!' and tries some banter with his Sergeant 'Can I wear your slippers, Sir?' he asks 'LOOK AT MY EYES!' Capone riplyies. I didn't really understand this comeback, but I assume The Searg was in no mood for fun and games. This is obviously because the film was under the fierce stranglehold of famous control freak Jim Cameroon, known for a lack of humour in all his films. Cameroon reluctantly casts Paxman in all his films as they're cousins and there is a definite tension between the comic genius of the actor, and the ultra serious 'I'm The Daddy' mentality of the Director.Ridley and crew fly down to the planet to hunt down the monsters but are shocked to find a survivor- a little boy called Newt. This is a deliberate attempt to soften the almost unrelenting darkness of the film, and possibly bring in a wider female audience who may enjoy the mother/son relationship which develops between Ridley and Nuke. The child doesn't talk much which in fact adds to the bleak tone, and the fact that he carries around a decapitated doll's head is rather disturbing. I mean, everyone knows boys don't play with dolls. Newt mumbles things like (in response to Ridley asking if he's hungry) 'I'm mostly scared. Mostly' and the bizarre 'Hi, Firmative!'. Presumably Firmative is some imaginary friend, or possibly futuristic slang. Through into the mix the fact that among the marines is a geeky science geek who wants to steal one of the monster eggs to bring home and experiment on or sell or something. Indeed, he hatches a plan to impregnate one of the gang with the egg so that no-one suspects anything. I think if I woke up with an 8 foot monster mounting me in an attempt to give me its seed, I might suspect something was not right. But back to the film. The gang underestimates the sheer number of the monsters (at least 25) and the fact that their King is on the island too, and soon it is the humans that are on the run. Cameroon is clearly adding a subtext here about man's destruction of nature and of other species, and that eventually it will turn around and we will be on the receiving end. I have studied film studies for at least a year, and have over a year's experience in social anthropology, so I know what I'm talking about. The last half of the film is really a series of chase scenes- in the alien base with tanks etc, in a bedroom with spider monsters, through the living quarters, and then into the sewers until The King wakes up. That's not to mention the super robot fight at the end which was a precursor to Cameroon's next film Terminator 2. So yes, there is much action and excitement, and lots of mistrust between characters which lends another level of tension.Most of the characters are killed off, but all fight well and you really feel like you got to know them. Ridley is a true mother- fighting for her family and friends, strapping on a grenade launcher to take on the bullies, Hudson is a comedian but also a bit of a moaner, Capone, Hicks, and Vasquez are all super tough and ultra cool. There is also Bishop, a cyborg who doesn't dance but preaches the Gospel and does magic tricks with knives. Perhaps if Riply had directed this he would have let some more comedy in, and it would have been a stronger film. At times I wanted to jump into the TV, grab a gun and help out my chums, pumping bullets into skulls. 'Come on, man! Shoot them! Here they come, quick, let's blow them away and get out of here! ARRGH!' I would have been shouting like that. Because the film is so dark and depressing though, I didn't have the energy to jump in and help. So all I could do was sit back and watch each of my friends get eaten, killed, or worse. Overall this is an excitement film, but Cameroon needs to relax and let some light in. I mean what's the point in having all these characters only for the planet to blow up at the end and kill them all? Best Scene: When the soldiers are walking through the alien corridors, and all the bleeps are getting closer, but no-one knows where they're coming from. It was quite scary, but would have been better if Hudson had jumped out with his underpants on his head and shouted 'ONLY ME!!!'",10,0,3,10 June 2009
Quantum of Solace," 008 Is Lonely And Angry
","Bont returns again once more for another time, and this time he has to chase bad guys and save a sexy woman. The original plot is a sequel to the previous year's Casino Royal which was heralded as a new beginning for Bone. True enough, as it saw Bond killing members of the Royal family when previously he had spent his life trying to protect them. Many didn't like this shift in tone- I didn't care as long as there was plenty of guns, gadgets and excitements. Quantum Of Soalce is aptly named- Bondy is now on his own after the FBI realised that killing the Royal Family wasn't the best idea and they want to blame it all on Bon. He has no friends, so the likes of P, W, and of course Mr Gadget- F do not appear in the film. This means there is a lack of humour and a more hard edged tone. Craig David suits this role perfectly as he rewinds through all the people he has met and tries to work out who the person who framed him is. His only friend on his journey is a sexy girl he meets along the way. She, Ivana Complenti wants revenge on the same bad guy Pond is after (Franz Grenade). He has a scary scheme to take over the world by turning water into diamonds. Of course Bint's main mission is to catch the man (Claws) who killed his woman from the last film- Gloria Stitz.Happily there is less card playing in this film, and more car racing- a much better game in my opinion. There is an excitement chase at the start where Blond and a group of bad guys run through the streets, then jump into cars to speed along the edge of a cliff, only to parachute off the cliff into a helicopter, fight in the helicopter down into the sea where they continue to fight on a hovercraft which moves from the sea, onto the beach, along the busy motorway, and back up the mountain into another sets of cars. This 40 minute scene is done in one take, without any cuts. Other bonuses include Bend being chased through the jungle by the same lasers who almost chopped him up in Goldenfinger, another fight with aeroplanes, a motorbike chase on top of a car, and various fist fights with lots of tables being broken. Not the best Bob film, but certainly the best so far.Best Scene: The little music interlude from Casino Royal being re-used as Band remembers his dead wife. It was very subtle, but very sad and obvious.",10,2,12,29 June 2009
Zulu," Chaaaaaarrrrrrge!
","This is a documentary about the various wars America has fought in Africa. It proves that even though the American army may have been severely outnumbered (at least 3 million to one) that their superior intellect and firepower would crush the enemy. How arrogant of the natives to try and fight the Americans who were only trying to bring some rock'n'roll to their continent. Did they think that the mighty US wouldn't fight back! Well, they soon saw the error of their ways as Lee Marvin, Michael Kane, Clint Eastwoodand co kick some butt! Yeah man! 10 Km! Wave after wave of bad guys come, wave after wave of bad guys fall. Let this be a lesson to the bad guys of the world. If you annoy us, you will die. If you attack us, you will die. If we attack you, oh you better believe yo gonna die! A strong piece of Propaganda produced by Spielberg which successfully wiped out every American/African War and brought peace. The rest of the world needs to watch.Best Scene: When Hawsbee is saving Jacobs and the rest of the gang from the fire in the bedroom.",10,1,15,20 July 2009
28 Days Later...," Scary dary.
","It is a well known fact that I actually had my own draft of this movie written before Danny Boy decided to make it. It was about 5 years (or 1825 days to keep with the mood of the review) before this film was made that I had a dream. Actually a nightmare. There are some differences, and some similarities. His is set in present day, mine seemed to be set in a near future. In mine an experiment with chimps led to a deadly virus which turned humans into bloodthirsty rage fulled monsters. And these creatures had red eyes. Very similar, eh? Well, my creatures could shoot fire from their mouths, lasers from their eyes, and vomit acid. And also in mine, some of the creatures began to evolve, remember how to speak, and remember their past lives. In fact the only thing which gave them away was their eyes, so they all started to wear shades to cover the redness. There was a shock ending also, which I will not reveal. Anyway, I was surprised when I saw the trailer for this and though hey! They've nicked my idea! But obviously these are just coincidences and no-one ever read my script anyway. I thought it looked good and as I'd liked Boy's earlier effort Gravespotting I thought I'd give it a go.Thebest thing is this; my dream was primarily about man's self destructive nature, and how abusing our forefathers (chimps) like many people in the world now do will only lead to chaos. Boy's film also shows this. I have seen a disturbing trend recently in movies which try to show that monkeys spread disease, that monkeys kill people, or that they are idiots. None of these are true. Monkeys are the best, most intelligent creatures on out planet and we should revere them. Sure in the future they're probably going to be our masters but that is all the more reason to love them now so that they befriend, rather than enslave us. Ha ha, only joking. That was a reference to another terrible film which portrays monkeys as evil. I want to see more films which show primates (that's the scientific term) as benevolent, harmless, peaceful, fun-loving dudes.The world would be a better place if we all monkeyed about a bit more. Spiders on the other hand are the spawn of Satan, and must be crushed on sight.This film has some scareful bits, and a few excitement moments where you're not sure whether to scream or not. The bit where the monsters are chasing the fools through the tunnel and the bit where Silly-Ann Murphy is walking round London by himself. He should have just went to Harrods and McDonalds and made out like bandits. He wakes to find the world is empty, Day of The Tulips style, but eventually is chased by the creatures. He meets up with a small group of survivors who explain what's going on, and they try to travel to Glasgow where there are other survivors, and better runways to escape on a plane from. They meet evil army men, they fight with the creatures, and generally have an exciting time. It's not the best horror film I've seen, but considering how awesome horror films are these days it really needed more scary bits and killings. However, as I am usually too scared by horror movies I though this was just right.Best Scene: When Murray is exploring Olde London Town and he looks into a car window- BOOM! A dead body falls by the window inside the car. Everyone jumped at that in my house!",8,2,3,21 July 2009
Lawrence of Arabia," Lots Of Things To Look Out, But Nothing To See
","Laurence Of Arabia is a film about an Englishman who decides to become a camel trader in Egypt. He gets involve in Wars, falls in love, and rides his camels. Camels are his one true love and they seem to understand him equally. Laurence is played by Robert Redford, and the best thing about the movie is how great Redford looks riding across the Mohave Desert dressed all in white. It was like watching a ghost movie set in the desert in daylight. Unfortunately although the film looks pretty it is far too long and nothing really happens. I like my films to be packed full of excitements, but in the 360 minutes of watching here there was only one fight scene, one camel chase, and the side of one boob. Very disappointing. Somehow this went on to become one of the most award winning films of all times, picking up 30 Oscars. If you want a better film about life in the desert watch Damnation Alley with Jan Michael Vincent. It has so much more excitement and has giant scorpions too! I won't be watching this again and I don't think you should too. Boring, long, and boring.Best Scene: When one man is looking off into the sunset and sees something approaching like a mirage. It takes 6 minutes (one continuous shot) for the thing to come into focus, and the director (who would go on to make The Shining) creates a palpable sense of tension. Is it going to be a monster? A Bad guy? Laurence? In the end it turns out to be the film's most startling scene- Ronnie Wood wearing the skin of Marianne Faithful which the costume department stole while she was sleeping and painted orange.",5,4,22,30 July 2009
2012," 2012: If climate change doesn't get you, the future will!
","It is a well known fact that some idiots believe the world will end on 21st Dec 2012. This is due to an age old series of prophecies written by the Mayans of South America. Now, they were a crazy bunch alright, crazy smart. Better mathematicians than Carol Vorderman, better space staring guys that Patrick Moore, smarter physicists than Stephen Hawkwing. They understood the galaxy and time, dates, calendars. They knew which day certain galactic events like eclipses etc would take place, hundreds of years before we could work it out. They built massive buildings and pyramids dedicated to such practices- buildings which on a certain hour of a certain day, in a certain year sunlight would penetrate and create wonderful shadows and pictures. Naturally with all these skills it is believed they could predict future events. As we live in a time of fear and nonsense one out of every one fools believes that the world is going to end one way or another, and probably soon. The Mayans say 2012, and some say every prediction they have made has come true. Of course the predictions themselves are as follows: 'When the smiling Devil Bird has turned 58 thousand times the grass will eat the land, and the Jaguar will have a corn bride'. Naturally this can be translated as the rise of Hitler. I have been to various temple and have spoken to many Mayan who now practice Christianity and laugh at such claims. The only prediction they made to me was that I would give them 5 dollars for a fertility statue. They were wrong. I have recently been making a few generous predictions of my own which I am confident will come true. Read into them what you may: Somewhere, some time on the 14th February 2014, there will be an episode of The Simpsons shown on TV; Madonna will be dead 150 years from now; When the Spac Twins reach four figure viewings on Youtube there will be a great cheer of despair; this film will make more than 137 Dollars at the Box Office on November 15 2009.Of course such fairy tales make for great films- and by great I mean balls. Roland 'The Rat' Iamrich has taken another end of the world scenario and turned it into a special graphics laden affair- their will be giant CG tidal waves, giant CG explodings, various famous world landmarks will be destroyed, and at some point the fat, nerdy one will make a quip which no-one will find amusing. About 3 hours into the movie the hero, his girlfriend, and his father/son will realize that they can save the world and restore all this ungodly destruction in a matter of hours by some simple natural/scientific solution that had previously slipped their minds. All will be well. I wait for the day when someone makes a film about the moon smashing into the earth- and is simply 127 minutes of explosions, people screaming and dying, and The Moon encroaching on everyone's personal space. It will surely be the greatest film of all time- by which I mean balls.Best Scene: I predict the best scene will be when a CG animal (Tiger/Wolf/Polar Bear/Rhino/Hippy) which has mysteriously blown across several continents to America chases our heroes until it eventually gets crushed by rock.

X-Men: The Last Stand," Cosplay: The Last Party
","X-Men: The Last Film is the last X-Men so far. It features more characters than ever before and all our old favourites such as Wolfer, Thundera, The Caper Wonder, Ice, Bust Face, Grape, Lee, Bowie, X, Mephisto, Cyclaps, Jean Reno, and of course Staples. Big bad guy Mr Magenta has assembled a horde of badness and is launching a final terrific attack against man. Only the X-Men can save the day but they know they will not all survive. As X's wife Abigail says: 'It's time, to make, yo stand!' This film has more excitements than all the other 2 films stuck agether. There are massive battle scenes to be seen, people punch each other with bridges, loads of people are killed, and there is lots of funny and good graphics. To celebrate the release of this film I was invited to a cosyplay party- a party where fans of a film or show all dress up as their favourite character. It turned into a huge event and people came dressed mostly as X-Menners but also as things from other things. I knew every chump in the galaxy would go as Wolfy, and all the women would go as Lara Craft, so I thought I would be special and go as a Tetris block- the L-Shape to be precise. I spent the night sliding into tight spaces and frequently getting stuck because the fit was so perfect. The firemen had to be called out several times but I wasn't bothered as I was racking up a huge imaginary score. There were people dressed up as Mario, Luigi, Giuseppe; some dressed up as Neon from The Matrix; some dressed up as Gunnels from Lord Of The Rings while others dressed up as Pat Butcher and Cilla Black. At the end of the night the whole thing descended into a terrible sight- think a cross between Society and Eyes Wide Shut. I managed to escape, but my bricks were ruined. Next time I go to one of these parties I will come prepared. I will go as Arnie and let off some Steam, dammit! Best Scene: When X has his head chopped off and rather than put it to waste, Wolverbean chucks it into a horde of bad guys knocking them into a pit of lava shouting 'Get ready for a surprise!'",1,1,3,14 September 2009
Iron Man," Dumb dumb dumb-dumb-dumb! Do-be-do-be-do-be-do- Iron Man!
","Iron Man is a remake of the bizarre and pointless Australian film Testi: Iron Man. That film was black and white and messed up. America doesn't like that sort of thing (neither do me) so they decided to turn it into an excitement film instead. Interestingly though, neither film features any appearances from any Black Sabbath member. There could have been a fight between Iron Man and Tony Iommi, or Ozzy could have been supplying Robin Downy Jr with drugs and liquor, but maybe then this wouldn't have received the U rating.The film is a rip off of Batman- a billionaire playboy who is worth millions, I can't remember his name, likes to build robots and sell them to bad guys in places like Egypt. He is bored with his life and fancies a change so he turns himself into a half man half machine half bird creature, and calls himself Iron Man. After his parents are murdered he realises his purpose is revenge. He covers his body in the latest weaponry- guns, lasers, big knifes, and learns to fly. After a brief training montage (running up hills, lifting cars, shooting targets showing his skill and fitness progress) he flies to a terrorist country and kills the bad guys. That's about it really. Quite shallow, but some good actions and graphics. I don't think anyone else famous was in the movie though I was pretty drunk on whiskey while watching it. I think it was an attempt to start a new franchise so maybe more things will happen in the next film. The Man Of Steel will return to a cinema near you next year or two! Best Scene: When Iron Man is learning to fly and he keeps zooming into the ceiling of his barn and whacking his head. What a chump!",Null,1,3,17 June 2009
The Deer Hunter," One For The Fearmongers
","The second World War II was a terrible time for the US. Thankfully this film follows the more enjoyable Viet Kong War, where Robert Mitchum, Christopher Biggins, Fredo, and Diane Keaton find their small town lives disrupted by invading bad guys. They like to spend their weekends hunting harmless animals and drinking Bud but this peace is disturbed when the tables are ironically turned and they become the hunted. They hide in the jungle for a while and meet a young group of teens called the Wolverines who are also hiding out. This young group includes various Shat Pack members- Rob Lowe, Michael J Keaton, Emilio Eckhart, Patrick Swayze, and Baby. The kids have hunting rifles too and decide to wage war on the Vietnamese who have enslaved their village, but they need a distraction. De Matteo, Biggins, and co etc decide to flee and force the bad guys to follow them, giving the Wolfers enough time and freedom to free the city! Unfortunately Robbie, Chrissie, and Fredoie, are captured and pitted off against each other in a terrifying game of life and poker. 2 prisoners are picked at a time and given a deck of cards- each takes a card and whoever has the lower card gets shot with a knife while the bad guys, laugh, bet, and have a generally knee-slapping time. Our heroes have been watching this, understandably horrified, waiting for their turn. Bob De Bobbo and Baggins are pulled out for their turn, but luckily Bob gets his hands on a flame thrower and toasts the bad guys- toasts them good and quips 'You talking to me? Not anymore!' They get back to town to find that the Wolfies have chased the bad guys away and all is well, although there have been casualties- Swayze's mullet got trapped in a harvester he was driving and he was torn into confetti. Usefully though they used this confetti for the celebratory parade so it wasn't for nothing. Just when you think the film is ending though it takes a sinister turn; it turns out that Baggins has become addicted to the deadly card game which he names Park The Fleece, Master Flip, and has been running underground tournaments. When someone challenges him to a game (he has only been watching before this) he gladly accepts to prove he ain't chicken. Frodo and Nero hear about this and race to the rescue but only make it in time to see the knife penetrate their friend's brain, and watch him fall to the floor, deading. It seems the Deer have claimed their final victim.Best Scene: When the friends are being airlifted out of the forest by Mountain Rescue, De Nee decides to tickle Fredo with a feather and he falls to the ground, losing his legs. De Lite feels guilty about this for the rest of the film, but to rub it in he shags Fredo's wife.",10,0,2,17 November 2010
X2: X-Men United," X2: X-Men United- how do you spell vindaloo with an 'X'?
","X2 is Part 4 of the trilogy, and being the middle section it is often the best. After Mr Magoonta was killed and captured in the first film he has been incarcerated into the superb American Prison System (he is locked in a cardboard box guarded by a dwarf wielding a bag of nutmeg). This means that all is well is the world of the X-Men (Xearth) and they are happy to pursue their other interests- Wolveryan paints, Rogue strips (clothes, not paint), Bumbit embezzles unfortunate street urchins with 3 card plop, Baldy fashions wigs from his oxter hair, Gargantuthon helps to build homes for the homeless in Romania, Goldberg tars the driveways of the rich and/or famous, Storm writes articles on good home living in small town newspapers, Magneter sits in boxes watched by dwarfs, and last but not least Terry babysits, whilst Chickpea organises seminars on maximizing the business potential of your software solutions. After a while they get bored and decide to form a league of superheroes for football (for you Americans, that's real football, not the embarrassment you play). The goodies become X-United and recruit such famous players as Donald Goalposts, Peely, Madonna, Robertini Bagginio, Boris Beckham, Stevie G, Figaro, and Zninadiniadine Zidanisizidane. The baddies are based in Manchester and are known as The Scum. When this first came out I enjoyed collecting all the various and varied various acting figures to play with. I would bring my tea-lights into my roof-space and have my own X-Men wars. I had all the figurines including my favourite- Stalin. I got the X-Men edition of Subbuteo with astro turf and would play for minutes at a time in my fake candlelight, flicking my balls in the gloom with a tender smile etched across my face. You could even play as some of the new teams that were introduced in the second film- The Policemen with their law enforcing magic powers, the Fireman who held the innocuous power of putting our cleansing flames, and the Doctormen whose power was editing competition application forms so that only their friends were successful. Some guy punches a hole in the wall and Annie Packscwhinn bounces around lovelyly.Best Scene: When Monstror has a free kick from 45 yards and sticks into the top corner like a bullet. It was so much like a bullet that it went through the net and took off the head of an innocent spectator in the front row of the crowd. It was OK though- it was an Everton fan.",10,0,1,21 June 2011
Heat," Heat Is Cool But Left Me Cold
","Mr Man is known for his flashy 80s era MTV style films, and Heat is no different, even if it's not the same as anything he's done before. This film is known throughout the universe for having the largest cast of stars in history- you could play 6 degrees of Kevin Beacon with this alone! Yes, if you have a favourite actor or female actor you can be sure they pop up here somewhere. Let's have a closer look: We have Alfred Pachinko starring as a disgruntled cop on the hunt for disgruntled bank robber Robin DeNiro. DeNero has a gang of criminals under his claw; Valerie Kilmar with her lovely donkey tail, Tim Sizeless as a disgruntled fat man, Charlston Heston as a mob warlord, Ralph Lungren as a bodyguard, John Fought as a grizzly old something, Will Smith as the wise cracking kid from the hood, Dani Trey-Ho-Tep as a Mexican smuggler, Steve Busheemee as The Man With No Plan, the list goes on. DePesci wants out of the gangster life so he divorces his current femme foetal Charlotte Theron and chases weather girl Amy Bremmennemaneman. She is his one chance at freedom, but will the love of a gangster's life prove to much for him? Val Killman is married to Ashleigh Dudd and has a skinny daughter called Natalie Porter. He is always cheating on his wife though with a list of women and strippers played by the lies of Angelina Jolly, Nichole Kilmer, Hank Wazarea, Grace Jones, Mad Una, and in a shocking camero Kirsten Dunce. Al Pacman lives with his 'slow' brother Jimmy Depp and is getting divorced from his wife Diane Keaton. They have a suicidal daughter played by Amidala Portman. His police force consists of Paul Weller, Art Metro, Donald Sutherfield, Harrison Sierra, and Harvey Kitten. There are a few shoot outs and some excitement moments but mostly it's just talking and crying. I like films with lots of actions, and this is a film about cops and robbers so there should really be more shootings, cars flying over jumps, snakes in suitcases, poison darts, and pens that shoot fire etc. Plus it's at least 4 hours long, and as there are so many characters and actors double crossing each other I just got confused. This must be based on a Shakespeare novel or something. I am very upset at this.Best Scene: Supposedly when Al and Rob meet in the movie it was the first time they met in real life. I though they had been in several other films with each other but I must have been wrong. There's a first time for everything!",8,0,1,26 July 2009
Beetlejuice," Ooh la la!
","Imagine Batman crossed with Johnny Depp and you'll probably start crying. Beetlejuice has nothing to do with either of those things. It is a film starring Winny Roader, Michael Clayton, Billy Baldwin, and Macauley Culkin's mum and of course Genie Davis. Genie and Billy have just moved into a scary looking haunted house in a small town. On the way to a shop their car is attacked by a dog and they drown. They die but as we all know when you die you become a ghost, or sometimes a zombie. It turns out though that there are rules, bureaucracy, and a whole new world (don't you dare close your eyes!) of the undead. They are given a massive rulebook for ghosts called 'The Unholy Bible' which tells them their powers and responsibilities. It turns out that they can stay together, but that they are trapped within the confines of the walls of their house. If they step outside they'll be eaten by a graboid. Where's Steve Irwin when you need him! Just as they are getting used to this a new family of yuppies decides to move in to the house and wreck everything. The ghosts begin to haunt, but they may need some help¬ÖHelp comes in the form of Buster Keaton. He plays a malevolent demon called Beetleguy, but if you say his name 3 times he turns into a bee and flies into your mouth. He specialises in ridding houses of pesky humeans, and will go to extreme lengths to achieve his goals such as making their trousers fall down in public. Genie and Billy give him the job but they realise he is too evil and wants to hurt the people. They have become fond of Winowner who plays their odd goth/emo/punk.metalhead/hippy/weirdo/son/daughter, and who happens to be able to see the dead. Beetleguy wants to marry her and then do things to her so they all have to work together to stop him. There is top class acting from everyone here, especially from Keats just one year before he dons the cape to become Clark Kent. He improvises many lines and shows his comedy stylings from his days as a comedian in such shows as Taxi and MASH. His most famous line is of course 'Go ahead¬Ö make my day punk!' but is also known for coming up with the popular phrase 'I'm the ghost with some toast'. He has many monologues, talks into the camera and has a dolphin of a times, coming out with filthy gems like 'Let's turn on the juice and shake out our juice!' when he sees a strip club has been built in his town. His chemistry with Winoprah is like Hydrochloric acid mixed with sulphur, but not as smelly- Betelguy: (after Lydia says his name three times) Time to playee!Overall this is a mostly enjoyable film, but perhaps too scary for the younglings. It was certainly too scary for me. Good costumes, graphics, and music, featuring the classic Harry From Delmonte songs 'Shake Manure Yeah' and 'Jump In The Lime' as well as a useful score from long time Tim Bunion fan Danny 'Elf' Man.Best Scene: When Beetleguy is annoying all the other dead guys so the voodoo lady sprinkles his head with dust until it grows and grows to the size of 8 heads. This makes me laugh every time I see it- (once)",10,1,3,27 July 2009
