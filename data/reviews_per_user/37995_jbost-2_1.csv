The Blair Witch Project," A Masterpiece of Terror!
","After reading some of the bad reviews I have seen here, I get the distinct feeling that the modern horror genre thrives on special effects, and people have come to expect that.  Well, the Blair Witch Project proves that you can have horror WITHOUT computerized special effects...REALLY GOOD HORROR.  The best horror is that which reflects the true darkness each of us harbors deep down in the pits of our souls.  It is this darkness that really comes out to play in the movie.  Sure, the plot sounds like a Grimm Brothers fairy tale (imagine Hansel and Gretel lost in the woods, til they find the witches house).  But the story is nowhere near two-dimensional.  Instead, you watch as the characters slowly pass from annoyance, anger, and exhaustion to dread, paranoia, and yes, fear.  That is the real theme of the movie.  The plot is so much window dressing.  Pay attention to the very beginning of the movie, as it proves pivotal in understanding the bizarre (and TERRIFYING) ending.  The plot is interesting, and you wonder if the legends really are true, but the most effective part of the movie is the level of self-identification with the characters.  A warning though: you may sit and laugh during the whole movie, but when the full effect of the ending hits you, I promise you too will be scared of the woods.  I did not watch this in the theater myself, but rented it on video.  Watching it with the lights off was bad enough, but lying in bed that night watching the shadows on the wall was worse.  The old maxim is false: what you can't see CAN hurt you!  This is DEFINITELY worth the money!  BUY THE VIDEO!",10,1,3,4 February 2000
