Blade Runner 2049," Strangely boring, lacking tension and intelligence.
","Don't believe the lying shills rating this a ten out of ten. The original Blade Runner is a masterpiece. This film is not. It only deserves a six, but I loved the original so I gave it a seven. My review will compare both films and it contains **spoilers**.First up its pacing. This film is actually much slower than the original, adding up to two hours and forty three minutes of mind numbing boredom. I love slow paced films provided there's enough drama and tension. The first Blade Runner film has long pauses, but its justified. The silence swells toward sudden violence or it occurs because a character is gnawing over a great line of dialog they've just heard or are about to express. So what makes a slow paced film entertaining? The solution is information provided at the right time.The first film immediately tells us that replicants are murderous outlaws. We see one commit murder. Some are hiding here on Earth in Los Angeles and Dekkard is forced to detect and kill them. All that information is given to the audience within the first few minutes. So when Dekkard is wandering through crowded streets of futuristic LA, we the audience are afraid for him, because any one of them could be a murderous replicant. Dear Ridley Scott repeat after me: Information creates tension.This newer film instead begins with long drawn out scenes of dull aimless searching and investigating. Since no villain shows up until the last hour, there's no reason for the hero to actually hurry or feel afraid. When the boring pace finally speeds up toward the end, you're so bored out of your skull, you forgot why anyone is doing anything and you no longer care or even notice what the film thinks is a stunning twist.Those shill reviewers are glowing about its photography. Compared to its budget, the photography is below standard. There are rare nice moments. Seeing the fusion powered spinners (those flying cars) again was nice nostalgia, but far too many albeit pretty shots of -- nothing happening -- rendered the plot all the more irrelevant.Now for the production design. The indoor set designs were poor, telling us very little about the world this film is set in. The 'production value' looks cheap. I don't mean that in a cheap sleazy film noir way (no that would have been cool), I mean that I don't know where they spent the 185million budget, because only a fraction of that was spent on the sets. Two things did work. The voice comp device has been updated reminiscent of 1984 (the Orwell film starring John Hurt) and there is a Total Recall (the original not the remake) style artificial Female hologram character that is programmed to love K (Ryan Gosling). Interesting, but hardly ground breaking, while the original film was ground breaking in too many ways to mention here. The close up long lens shots in the original made the grimy futuristic streets of Los Angeles really look and feel like a crowded claustrophobic sleazy poverty stricken hellhole. Such a lens also gives size to any character in the foreground making Ford look all the more epic.This film used wider lenses and so the pent up tension of the original street scenes is non existent. In fact very rarely does it venture outside into the streets, so that we cannot breathe in the human polity as easily as we did in the original. The original film had real light emanating from miniature buildings, vehicles and advertising. I'm sorry but computer generated light just doesn't behave like real light does. Real light goes where it wants. The human eye cannot be fooled. Syd Mead is a genius. But looking at this film makes me think he wasn't given the power he needed to bring out this film's potential. It actually looks like some hack is trying to copy him. This makes me feel sad to write that. His work on Elysium (2013) was far superior.And now the acting. Gosling plays it straight (and glum) as he did in the pretty to look at but boring Bangkok crime flick Only God Forgives. There is a plot reason for this, but his dull acting compounds this movie's languid pace. There's not enough of Harrison Ford, who only shows up in the last hour (maybe less?). Jared Leto's monologues are just awful. Its not his fault. He's miscast and badly written.Like Mead, Philip K Dick is a genius too, both films are inspired by his literary masterwork 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep'. This film didn't delve deep enough, barely scratching the intellectual surface. Since many of his concepts are incredibly visually rich that just compounds the cinematic failure here. Should you go and see this? If you're a fan of the original, I think you should. The story ends in a way that sets things up for another Blade Runner movie which I hope will actually be entertaining. This film is meant to be a science fiction noir film, but it has little of the intelligence we expect from science fiction and none of the crime solving tension that is required of film noir. It lacked the brutal immediacy of the original nexus 6 villains the first one had in spades. It lacked the tense cat and mouse hunting game that made the original so intense, a race where the lead changed more than once. It just isn't as clever as its, at times pretty visuals and constantly obnoxious soundtrack, pretends it to be.Instead we get a self important bloated fatware art-house snoozefest that is bleak, boring and about as intellectually deep as counterfeit artificial snake skin.",Null,603,1098,6 October 2017
Lucky Number Slevin," The Wrong Man aka Yojimbo aka A Fistful Of Dollars
","Akira Kurosawa's film Yojimbo involves a samurai that plays off two rival criminal clans against each other until they are both annihilated. Sergio Leone made almost a shot for shot remake of Yojimbo unofficially (Kurosawa sued him and won out of court) to create Fistful of Dollars, the movie that made Clint Eastwood a legend. In that movie Eastwood played a gunslinger playing two ranchers against each other and, you guessed it, both of their crews get annihilated. This movie is heavily influence by both of those films. In it Josh Hartnett plays off Ben Kingsley against Morgan Freeman and destroys them both. Hartnett gets a lot of help by a mysterious hit-man. The hit-man is played by Bruce Willis, in the last film he actually bothered to care about and act well in. His character is reminiscent of Willis' Butch from Pulp Fiction. The Wrong Man (also known as Lucky Number Slevin) is a compelling fast paced action thriller in it's own right and its probably a good primer for the two older films I mentioned.",Null,1,1,18 October 2017
It," Generic scares but good acting and characters.
","I saw this in the cinemas so those of you who are reading this years after its release must contend with the fact that horror films tend to be more intense and scary on a big screen, in front of a large thrilled audience, so take that into account when reading this. Those of you who will or have watched this on your phone, you're missing out on the full experience. Always watch intense movies like horror films in a cinema.Anyway, this movie was pretty entertaining. The plot was pretty simplistic: A gang of young misfits must band together to defeat a demonic enemy that has the ability to shape shift, invade their thoughts and make them hallucinate. This of course creates loads of opportunities for scares. The scares don't come in the most original of ways and there's the usual whooshing sounds to accompany the scares. I actually recognised that clich√©d thx sound where the volume goes up at the start of a thx certified film. I find that annoying and unoriginal but along with all the other elements builds a compelling effective and scary story. But its not the scares that makes this film great. Its the chemistry between these young actors that rewards your viewing. They really care about each other and so we in turn want them to survive. There is no 'save the cat' scene to make us like them. Nothing manipulative like that, just good kids with good hearts. Their friendship also explores side themes of sexual awakening, the gaining of courage and loyalty. It also makes a good point about self esteem for kids that feel out of place in their own home, town and skin.The young actors, all of whom I've never heard of before, really work well together. I am guessing they were cast based on the great chemistry between them and not simply getting the most high profile individuals actors, as is usually the case with Hollywood films.Tim Curry was brilliant as the titular character 'IT' in the original released in 1990. In this film we don't have a brilliant actor in his role. In fact rather than replicating Tim Curry's acting ability with raw talent, this film uses computer generated imagery to make the monster grin, snarl and scream instead, so you if you were planning on seeing how the new actor's performance compares to Curry's genius turn, you'll be disappointed. I thought this took away from the movie, but I've seen the original, so this may not be an issue for you.In conclusion this film is a solid horror film. Its well made with great attention to detail. This isn't one of those films that was made as a quick grab for cash as is the case with many remakes. It can hold its head high. Its a polished impressive work of youthful horror.",Null,3,5,20 September 2017
Akira," THE Anime Classic bar none.
","This is the best Anime film ever made. Period. Full stop. End note.This movie is not a computer generated animation film. Each frame is lovely hand drawn by pure animation genius. There is something inexplicably beautiful about that compared to the computer generated animation work we see now which is too clean, perfect and lacks the charm of human subjectivity. We must never forget that objectivity leaches subjectivity of its beauty. If you have never seen this, you literally cannot call yourself a fan of anime.This movie largely follows the adventures of a small band of bikers who stumble upon a government conspiracy to control children that possess enormously powerful psychic ability. These children are know as the Psychic Children or as The Espers. The location of the movie is a hyper real advanced Tokyo, in the aftermath of a huge explosion of psi-kenetic energy that destroyed the original Tokyo. The government program was terminated for 31 years and the Espers present were kept in isolation to keep any information from being leaked. They wield a variety of psychic powers that are weak compared to those of Akira and Tetsuo, but are still strong enough to overcome a normal human being when combined. Although the Espers are children, their bodies take on a wizened appearance; the reason is because of years of being experimented on and taking special drugs designed to inhibit their psychic and thus physical growth. I'm going to stop right here. I'm depriving you of the wonderful story that is Akira. Watch it now!",Null,1,4,8 November 2016
The Fan," A brave plunge into obsession.
","The Fan is an excellent thriller directed by British director Tony Scott (True Romance, Top Gun) and stars Robert De Niro and Wesley Snipes. It is an intense and disturbing plunge into the darkness of obsession. Its rated average on this site is far too low to be believed (5.8 at time of writing). I contend that the unhealthy subject matter of obsession cut too close to the bone for many viewers, hindering a more favorable and fairer rating. Perhaps this film held a mirror too close to their own faces. I don't know what they were expecting. Obsession is a common theme in thrillers and for those that can stomach it, please note that it is used in an uncommonly brilliant way here.Robert de Niro is superb as Gil Renard. Gil's life is on a slow downward spiral. His sales job is under threat and an atrocious relationship with his ex wife threatens to derail his tenuous connection with his wide eyed innocent son. Think of a more intense darker quieter Willy Loman. Gil's desperation for professional and personal success mirrors the fortunes of his beloved but ailing San Francisco Giants who haven't won a pennant in years. This might change though when the club announces a brand new marquee singing in Bobby Rayburn (Snipes) and so Gil starts to invest all his hopes in the success of this elite baseballer. Gil feels a strong connection to him as he himself played baseball. In Gil's mind, he was a great 'has been', but in reality he is a 'never was' and never played beyond little league. He should be internally fixing his life, but instead he externalizes all of his hopes, failure and sadness into an unhealthy obsession for Rayburn.Gil dips into fantasy whenever he faces external disappointment and finds solace in repeating mantras his childhood hero, little league coach Coop (Charles Hallahan) instilled in him years ago. Gil considers Coop the finest proponent of the art of baseball. When we see Coop later we realize this might be pure fabrication. As Gil's ability to judge reality deteriorates his obsession hurtles toward a dark dangerous and suicidal path; an older angrier 'Taxi Driver' driven beyond the point of no return.Bobby Rayburn in contrast sees life picture perfect. He knows he isn't Gods gift to the sport and admits it when he gets lucky on the diamond. But to someone like Gil, seeing Rayburn hitting a home run to win a game, its as magnificent as anything anyone has ever done in baseball. It happened because Rayburn is God's gift to the Giants. The schism between them, the golden ones that light up the scoreboards and simple folk like Gil, is apparent to everyone but Gil, whose continual lapse into childhood baseball fantasy is both realistic, understandable and tragic. Rarely has this spiritual divide been better examined in any sports related films. This might explain the low rating this film has on this site. Film viewers want to live the Rayburn fantasy and not the loser reality however brilliantly observed in Gil. I gave it an 8 out 10.",Null,1,1,22 September 2017
Doctor Strange," Pretty ordinary fantasy film
","This film is based on a series of comics that I used to read many years ago. Its been so long that I cant really remember all that much, but I do remember that the comics were quite random in that the world it built had endless possibilities. So when this film concluded it did set up the possibility for that to be furthered in future films. Cumberbatch (Doctor Strange) was really good in this.His character arc is quite formulaic though. He starts out an arrogant holier than thou surgeon, but is brought down to earth when he is almost crippled while driving his over powered luxury car off the road. The road to recovery is littered with the usual trials and tribulation until the answer lies in the realm of the metaphysical, a realm that a straight laced surgeon has difficulty accepting. Accept it he must of course, because, as per usual in this type of story, the fate of all human kind rests in his surgically capable hands. The CGI effects were quite good. In fact they won an academy award. I admit I got a bit bored watching this though; I found the story to be predictable. If however you enjoy a fantasy film with a very three dimensional hero with real flaws and excellent cgi effects, you should check this out.",Null,1,3,13 September 2017
The Bourne Ultimatum," Better than Bond.
","The Jason Bourne films with Matt Damon in them succeed where the current James Bond films fail. While Daniel Craig's sociopath Bond wallows in self loathing and psychopathy, the emotional sub plot in the Jason Bourne films are direct, focused and sensible.It makes sense for a man that has lost his memory to desperately try and figure out who he is, even without highly trained assassins dogging his every move. Throughout the series, he attempts to make amends for his nefarious espionage past and in doing so, blazes a path toward redemption. Having read two of the originals books this series is based upon, I can say that the Jason Bourne character is actually better fleshed out in the films and no doubt intellectual actor Matt Damon had a lot to do with that.

Predator," The best Sci Fi Action film ever made
","Well what can I say about this tense thrilling movie that hasn't already been said? If you haven't seen or heard of this film, know this. There is something wrong with you!This is the best sci fi action film ever made. Big Arnie, the best action hero the world has ever known, takes on a space alien in a kill or be killed, bloody battle to the death. In a jungle. With guns blazing. Muscles flexing. Sweat dripping at a faster rate than the empty shell casings hitting the leach laden jungle floor. Okay thats an exaggeration. But you get the idea.Everybody in this movie is so flawlessly cast, you forget you are watching actors, so I'll just use the character names. Dutch, Dillon, Anna, Mac, Blain the God Damned Sexual Tyrannosaurus, Sonny, Billy, Poncho and Hawkins with his awfully sexist but funny jokes, are all brilliantly realized. I love this movie.

L√©on: The Professional," Modern Crime Classic
","This is really two films in one. Let me explain.A movie was released in 1994 called 'The Professional'. Two years later a longer version with an additional 25 minutes appeared. This was called the International version. The shorter original version is what director Luc Besson refers to as his directors cut. Both are English language, but have a very strong French influence. Lovers of European crime films and thrillers will love this film.Both version are modern crime classics, inspired by a medieval French ballad about a knight that was in danger of losing his land through battle, until he mounts one last heroic effort and with a blood curdling battle cry (as seen in the end of the film) he hurls himself once more at the enemy and wins the day. This is one of the many spiritually profound things in this film that lift it from a generic crime film, augmented by a timeless soundtrack by Eric Serra.The plot: A lethal foreign hit-man befriends a young girl after sparing her from the same bloody fate that befalls her family, gunned down by a vicious corrupt cop and his merry band of killers. One of whom in real life would later die on September 11 (he played 'Benny').The young girl is Mathilda (Natalie Portman in a very early role). Mathilda demands to stay with her savior, the recalcitrant hermit hit-man, Leon. This sets up a nice role reversal. The older Man should be the one that calls the shots, but he's a helpless foreigner that cannot read English and so it falls to the younger vivacious Matilda to save him right back.The socially awkward man child Leon wears ill fitting clothes made for a teenager not an adult. He really is just half a man. He spends his time between hits drinking enough milk to raise a brood of orphans, just in case the child motif wasn't established enough already. He also trains and trains his body and mind to be the sort of lethal weapon that negates the need to fully integrate into this new foreign world. Half man half child.Leon is bewildered by Matilda and doesn't know how to handle her. Mathilda eventually becomes infatuated with Leon, mistaking his paternal protective mechanism as mutual love. Some Narrow minded film critics see more to that than what it is.As soon as Matilda realizes what Leon does for a living, she demands that he teach her how to kill, hoping to learn the skills required to get revenge on those that made her an orphan. Leon flatly refuses. He also rejects her naive romantic overtures. Ashamed and rejected She runs off alone toward a bloody showdown with the corrupt cop Stansfield (Gary Oldman in his psychotically brilliant career defining role), who murdered her entire family at the start.Talk of a sequel has been bubbling along for years. Director Luc Besson has written a screenplay, but having left Gaumont (the company that produced this film) it appears they are withholding the screenplay from him as well as the rights to make said sequel, so it may never happen.",Null,5,6,5 February 2016

The Thing," John Carpenter's Best Film

This time it's a research team trapped by a blizzard in Antarctica with no hope of rescue.Kurt Russell is brilliant in this. This movie is decades old, but hasn't aged one day. The visual fx in it are nothing short of astounding and Carpenter's atmospheric music adds a eerie creepiness to this film in just the right amount and in the right places.

","This movie is perfectly cast, perfectly directed and shot, every line, frame, breath is pitch perfect. It is cinematic kismet in a DVD case.Back when the term mashup meant nothing, this classic comedy Science fiction Horror film stretched technical and imaginative boundaries in ways that rarely, even after many decades, have ever been matched by any other film in any other genre. This movie is so amazing that after seeing the recent 2016 version (vomit in one's mouth) I came back to raise my 8 out of 10 score to a 9. This movie was made in 1984. It still has better visual and optical effects than the version released 32 years later - the latter movie of course killing the ghostbusters franchise from which it may never be resurrected. Ghostbusters 2 wasn't as good as this movie, but ghostbusters (2016) makes Ghostbusters 2 look like an undead Citizen Kane.If you are a fan of the latest ghostbusters abomination, and you haven't seen this one, you need to so that you will understand why Ghostbuster fans were so horrified with the latest version.",Null,3,5,30 July 2017

Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A mean spirited descent into cinematic sadism.
","I like violent films as long as the violence is justified. Revenge in films need to follow that same rule. The revenge in Braveheart is justified. A man kills the man that murdered his wife. An eye for an eye. The revenge in Jaws is justified. William Wallace and Chief Brody deserve our respect, because they take revenge at an equal proportion to how they and their community were wronged. The Bride in this film does not and that's why its a poor film. This film goes far beyond an eye for an eye. It takes a nose dive off the sanity cliff and plummets toward a soulless sadistic endeavor made by a sadist to titillate other sadists. It advances the notion that we are meant to admire a sadist for taking out several eyes for the loss of just one eye. Its most sadistic crime is where the film attempts to actually justify forcing an innocent child to witness her own mother being butchered. The scene ends with the murderer cooing at the child as though the kid could care less what her mother's murderer thinks about anything. Kill Bill Part 2 ends with the avenging sociopath walking off into the sunset with her own daughter unscathed like she earned that ending. Yeah right.In case you didn't notice, this movie is about revenge. We know this because the main character played by Uma Thurman constantly whines about deserving it. This is not a character to be admired. This is a petulant child throwing one manically violent tantrum after the next. If this film were a book it would be titled a sociopath's guide to revenge. Anyway while she was clearly wronged, the loss of just one life does not justify going on an insane rampage and killing dozens of people.Let us think of the classic crime film The Godfather. A film that handles violence and revenge with complete class. The first scene introduces the code by which the mafia live by. The scene shows a man demanding revenge for his daughter being assaulted. She is still alive, but her father wants the two men responsible to die. The Godfather gives the man justice, but not to the extent that he wants. This is logical, revealing the mastery of wisdom a mafia crime boss needs to maintain his position. In Kill Bill the bride deserves revenge, but not to the extent that she wants. To round out the weirdness, Uma Thurman was apparently preferred by Tarantino, since her face reminded him of the famous horse Trigger. No really.The technical aspects of this film is good. You have to give credit to the crew that completed their work with technical mastery. The work though is directed by Quentin Tarantino, so the real credit for his skill, lies in the artists he steals from. Go watch Thriller: A Cruel Picture (1973), which was released as They Call Her One Eye in America, which is the basis for the Daryl Hannah character (the lady with the eye patch over one eye). Or watch Lady Snowblood to see where Tarantino stole the snowy fight scene or the several Sonny Chiba films that have better fight choreography. While you're at it, ask Bruce Lee fans how they feel about his most famous costume worn by a person who cant fight, whose lack of martial skill is hidden by fast cutting, like cheap perfume hides stink.No wonder Tarantino makes a film about a sociopath supposedly deserving respect for reaping much more than they sow. He has made a very successful career out of it. In an America that has teenagers committing mass murder in high schools and in a world where death cults fueled by sadistic revenge threaten to destroy us all, movies like this should never be made.",Null,1,3,14 September 2017

If you've seen the Bill Murray comedy the plot will seem awfully familiar. The main character keeps repeating the same day until he sets things right.

Ran," Kurosawa does King Lear
","Put simply, this is an excellent Samurai version of Shakespeare's King Lear. To be fair if you combine Shakespearean tragedy with Samurai swords, medieval castles and fuedal savagery, you can't really go too far wrong.This was produced and directed by Akira Kurosawa, the most beloved of all Japanese filmmakers. His work is much more accessible than arguably Japan's finest ever film director, Ozu. This is probably Akira Kurosawa's most popular film after Yojimbo and Sanjuro. This is one of the few Akira Kurosawa films shot in color. This movie can also lay claim to the fact that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg ponied up the dough to fund and release it to a worldwide audience. That almost made up for Howard the Duck and 1941.If you're not familiar with the story of King Lear, here is the deal. It's finally time that an aging senile king must divide up his kingdom between his three daughters. Two are conniving moles whose tongues only ever drip honeyed platitudes to their Father. Since they tell him what he wants to hear, he hands them the largest pieces of his royal pie, while the third, the honest and pious but bluntly speaking youngest daughter is pushed to the side. Being the wisest, she bides her time, fully expecting her older sisters to annihilate one another and ready to step in to salvage whatever is left of her Father's kingdom, whom she only wants to preserve in order to honour her ailing father. Clearly the tragedy is that her Father should have chosen her over her nasty cold hearted siblings.So swap that for an aging Samurai lord and his three Male heirs and you basically get the idea. To complicate that family tragedy, old enemy armies stand at the border, massing to attack his land, while the old senile fool is dithering over who gets to eat pie and who gets stand in the shadows. This is one excellent samurai action war film. It's a good primer in getting acquainted with the art and story telling of sensei Kurosawa, himself an actual member of the Samurai class, so it is something of a poignant thing for him to tell stories purely exploring the national character of both feudal and modern Japan.I own the bluray version of this movie and the picture is stunning.",Null,2,4,8 February 2016

Alien: Covenant," Incompetent weirdos fail a mission.
","They fail due to making a series of stupid rash decisions made under no pressure whatsoever, placing themselves in a position to make even more stupid rash decisions. Am I talking about the plot of this film?No. I'm talking about the people that made this film.This movie must have been written by a xenomorph. There is no other explanation for how this movie turned out to be so single-mindedly nasty and stupid. If it were written by human beings you have to accept the following; that the fans of this franchise are stupid, don't remember what has come before and logically expect highly trained astronaut scientists to make rash decisions that make no logical sense whatsoever. It was as though this movie was a lesson in pathological self sabotage. You also have to presume that the makers of this film just don't care and threw something together without any planning and forethought at all and made a half baked movie to meet some deadline that was soon approaching. Or something. Yeah let's go with that.This film was meant to continue what was hinted at in Promotheus. As problematic as that film was, it did explore some cool concepts, stuff everyone expected to be fleshed out by this film. Instead its a poor remake of the first Alien with some petty guff that is meant to explain why the xenomorphs were made in the first place. I hope later films debunk this and at least make the reason more plausible, dramatic and satisfying. This movie actually contains the word 'Alien' in the title, but only shows one for about five minutes out of a two hour film. Even then its a poor copy of a previous fight Ripley had against the queen in the second film, even going so far as copying one line of her dialog. Ridley Scott used to make films with some originality. I'm not entirely certain if this film isn't a tongue in cheek spoof of his own work, but played straight. And poorly. In it's defense I will say to the other reviewers complaining about other types of xenomorphs suddenly being introduced (plant life through the air for example), the third film had a dog hybrid alien and the fourth had a Ripley/Alien hybrid too.",Null,1,3,25 July 2017
