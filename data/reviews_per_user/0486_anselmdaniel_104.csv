The Avengers," Awesome spectacle
","This review contains spoilers.The Avengers is a superhero action movie that premiered in 2012. The movie is directed by Joss Whedon, produced by Kevin Feige, screenplay by Joss Whedon. The story is written by Zak Penn, and Joss Whedon. The movie stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, and Tom Hiddleston. Loki launches an invasion of Earth leading the heroes of the Earth to band together and stop the invasion.The Avengers is a great action movie. The movie incorporates the grand visuals found in the previous Marvel Cinematic Universe movies and combines them for one spectacle featuring the heroes that we know and love. The movie focuses on the spectacle rather than having a complex narrative focusing on specific characters. In this way it is more of a large set piece with pre-existing characters rather than a full narrative movie. The spectacle is impressive to watch with the ending battle in New York City being the highlight. The scenes leading up to that moment are impressive as the heroes band and fight amongst each other. The movie is about the heroes as a whole rather than individuals.The Avengers has great chemistry with its leads. Not only does the audience see visually impressive action but also the dynamic between the superheroes. The movie relishes in the heroes it has on display and it is a treat to watch for comic book fans. Audiences can see the heroes have their quarrel and what happens when Thor's hammer hits Captain America's shield. The story concerns the heroes and it is believable that Nick Fury's Avengers squad would not get along at first. It makes for an interesting story as the squad eventually overcomes their differences and begins to work together. This is a classic trope that is applied to a superhero story.The flaw of this movie is that Loki has not been built up as a massive villain before. Loki always seemed more like a joker and a specific villain for Thor rather than a large scale villain that spanned into Iron Man and Captain America's stories. I still enjoyed Tom Hiddleston's performance and watching him on the screen is sure to delight.I would recommend The Avengers.Grade: B",8,0,0,11 January 2020
Blade Runner 2049," A different Blade Runner
","This review contains spoilers.Blade Runner 2049 is the sequel to Blade Runner. The movie is directed by Denis Villeneuve and stars Ryan Gosling. The movie takes place 30 years after the end of the first movie. Ryan Gosling plays officer K, a replicant police office, investigating a mystery of a replicant child that underwent a natural birth.Blade Runner 2049 is a beautiful movie. The movie is gorgeously shot with images that will stock with the viewer. Denis Villeneuve is an excellent director that was able to capture the spirit of the original movie with his own style. Denis Velleneuve is also able to convey emotions on the screen without dialogue simply by showing visuals. The visual aspect is easily the best part of this movie and any scene has the classic Blade Runner feel to it.The story can be hit or miss for the audience. Much of the movie is about Officer K. Ryan Gosling does a good job in his portrayal of the character but much of the movie revolves around K's actions to other characters. This is where the audience's involvement in the character's struggle is important. Throughout the movie, K believes himself to be the chosen one, the replicant that was born from a human father and replicant mother. This narrative is supported by Joi. The entire movie is the investigation of this. The audience needs to care about this story arc. However some elements of the movie are weak that prevent fully enjoyment and engrossment into this part of the movie. Niander Wallace, played by Jared Leto, has weak scenes and does not feel like a developed character. He simply wants the child for profit. Likewise, a replicant resistance movement wanted to protect the child. The motives and evidence is not completely clear and some of this feel intentional. The ending with K finding Deckard is also out of place as K had lost track of Luv at this point. Somehow he was able to find Deckard's convoy and was able to shoot down the correct cars. This felt strange to me as up to this point, the movie felt logical.The movie's minor flaws are not enough to prevent enjoyment of the movie. Ryan Gosling is great on the screen and I became engrossed in the story. It was great revisiting the Blade Runner universe and seeing its themes were still intact. I also enjoyed the dynamic between K and Joi.Blade Runner 2049 is highly recommended.Grade: A",8,1,3,10 June 2018
Alien 3," Confusing and muddled
","This review contains spoilers.Alien 3 is a science fiction movie that premiered in 1992. The movie is the follow up to 1986's Aliens. The movie is directed by David Fincher and stars Sigourney Weaver. The story is written by Vincent Ward. The movie takes place sometime after the conclusion of Aliens.Alien 3 is an incredibly messy movie. The theatrical version has confusing elements inside of the story and it serves to show how the production of the movie has not been spotless. The movie is a callback to the original Alien movie in 1979. The prison that the movie is set in serves to contain that claustrophobic and tight atmosphere that the first movie created. The movie uses the setting well enough but it does not have that magic that the first two movies had. The characters in this movie are not as engaging as the characters in the last two movies.Alien 3 also does away with the surviving characters of the second movie, Aliens. In the opening moments of this movie, the characters of Hicks, and Newt are removed from the story. The movie's story has no need for these characters much to anybody that watched Aliens' disappointment. The movie could and should have done better to these characters that audiences enjoyed in the second movie. In addition, Bishop from the second movie does not resemble his helpfulness that was present in the second movie. This disappointed me as a viewer as all of the older characters no longer resemble what they were in the second movie.The movie still has high production values and is well directed. David Fincher does an admirable job. However, the movie could not improve past its writing. The movie felt like it was bouncing around certain ideas and not certain which ones would be able to stick. In some ways, this movie felt tied to the second movie and the third movie wanted to go back to how the first movie utilized its story. In this case, I believe that it would have been more preferable to create another character other than Ripley to be involved with the Xenomorphs. The universe in this film series is large and Ripley surely could not have been the only character to survive encounters with the Xenomorph.Despite the problems in Alien 3. I would still recommend the movie. The movie is muddled and the alternate cuts of Alien 3 are preferable to the theatrical cut. The movie can infuriate fans of the second Aliens movie.Grade: C",5,0,0,29 February 2020
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Excellent sequel
","This review contains spoilers.Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is a period mystery film that premiered in 2011. The movie is directed by Guy Ritchie and is the follow-up to 2009's Sherlock Holmes movie that is also directed by Guy Ritchie. Robert Downey Jr., Jude Law, and Rachel McAdams reprise their roles as Sherlock Holmes, Dr. John Watson, and Irene Adler. Sherlock Holmes and John Watson embark on an adventure across Europe to foil a plot by Professor Moriarty.This sequel is incredibly entertaining and enjoyable. Anyone that enjoyed the first movie's style and direction will also enjoy the direction in this second installment of A Game of Shadows. If anyone is on the fence about the direction in the first movie this second movie absolutely improves upon it. The action scenes still have that slow motion slow-down and speed up however there is more of a reason for this choice in this movie. These scenes are used more to highlight the perill the main characters find themselves in. They are also executed in more of an entertaining fashion in this movie.There is a strange misstep in this move that happens at the beginning. It is revealed that Irene Adler played by Rachel McAdams is working for Moriarty. She is immediately poisoned and dies. It felt weird that she was given a part of the main cast even though she was not present for much of the movie. That scene was a good way of introducing the main villain of Moriarty.Montarty is a fantastic villain in A Game of Shadows. This is how I imagined Moriarty from the novels. Moriarty is a terrific villain in his writing, presentation, and execution. Moriarty's plans are well written in the execution and it is great to see them unfold on the screen. When Moriarty and Holmes do one last duel it definitely had an epic feeling of two intellectuals clashing. Everything up until that point had a lot of build up for Holmes to stop the plan of Moriarty.Noomi Rapace joins the main cast of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law as a Gypsy traveler. I enjoyed her character, but I still missed Irene Adler. Noomi Rapace does a good job in the role. I did not think the writing of her character was the best. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law does a
fantastic job and they continue to nail the role of Sherlock Holmes and Dr John Watson.I would recommend 'Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.' This is a solid adventure mystery movie with a great period theme to it.Grade: B",8,1,2,13 April 2019
The Incredible Hulk," Messy but still enjoyable
","This review contains spoilers.The Incredible Hulk is a superhero action movie that premiered in 2008. The movie is directed by Louis Leterrier, written by Zak Penn, and stars Edward Norton as Bruce Banner. The movie is based on the character The Hulk created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. The movie follows Bruce Banner as he becomes The Hulk and hides as a fugitive from the United States military.The Incredible Hulk has a muddled story. The story is not as straightforward as the first Marvel Cinematic Universe movie of Iron Man. This movie has many problems in its narrative that shows in the story's structure. The movie jumps around in time and it makes it hard for the audience to care about Bruce Banner. None of the characters matter except for Bruce Banner. It is clear in this movie that the focus is only on Bruce Banner and the world is not as interesting as it was in Iron Man.Edward Norton does a great job as Bruce Banner. I enjoyed his performance in this movie as he goes from fugitive to hero. I was happy to see that Edward Norton made Bruce Banner out to be a scientist rather than the destructive Hulk that he has.The action computer generated graphics is clear to the audience. The exposed computer generated imagery made for a rough experience as the action scenes did not have much weight to it. I felt that this was the movie's poor trait as the movie failed to have the action in the movie mean something. The action is still pretty and fun to look at but it failed to impress the audience from a story stand-point.I would still recommend 'The Incredible Hulk'. Although there are problems in its story, the movie is still entertaining to watch and can keep the audience's interest for the 112 minutes of running time.Grade: C",6,0,0,4 January 2020
3:10 to Yuma," A beautiful western
","This review contains spoilers.3:10 to Yuma is a 2007 western film directed by James Mangold. The movie is produced by Cathy Konrad. The movie stars Russell Crowe and Christian Bale in a story that is about the capture and delivery of a criminal to Yuma prison. Dan Evans, played by Christian Bale, is a one-legged rancher that aids in the capture of outlaw Ben Wade, played by Russell Crowe.3:10 to Yuma is a well-written movie. This movie is based on a short-story 'Three-Ten to Yuma' by Elmore Leonard. The movie features a great villain in Ben Wade played incredibly well by Russell Crowe. The villain feels believably distinct in the movie and offers a fresh perspective whenever Ben Wade is on the screen. Ben Wade has his own code that becomes more apparent as the movie goes on. This code made me and other audience members respect him. The presence that Russell Crowe provides makes the movie much more exciting and enthralling to watch.The performance by Christian Bale is excellent. His character of Dan Evans had a nice progression through the movie and it showed in the acting and story. Dan Evans has a backstory of being a Civil War veteran that is revealed throughout the movie. Even in the more emotional parts of this movie Christian Bale's acting holds up and provides nice moments for the audience. Dan Evans' relation with his son is interesting to watch. The final revelation that Dan Evans had done the mission to give his sons, a good memory or makes the earlier portions of the movie more rewatchable.Both Dan Evans and Ben Wade's onscreen chemistry is great. The two actors, and characters have great lines and delivery that make the movie much more enjoyable. Each of the moments with the two characters serves to make the audience understand more about the characters in a meaningful way.James Mangold's direction should be praised. He delivers an incredibly beautifully shot movie. The movie features many classic western settings that are delivered in an exciting way. There are many scenes that are gorgeous to look at. Even the distinction the towns and countrysides are apparent in the direction.The only fault the movie may have is its slow pacing. This movie feels out of its era as the movie is a slow burn to the climax. I do not consider this a weakness of the movie as it is also a reason why I like the movie. The beauty of the movie is seeing the western setting and themes realized on the theater screen. There are not many gun fights in this movie which can let down some audiences expecting an action movie.I highly recommend '3:10 to Yuma'. This movie is everything I look for in a solid western.Grade: A",9,1,2,3 February 2019
Skyfall," A beautifully directed Bond
","This review contains spoilers.Skyfall is a spy movie directed by Sam Mendes. The movie premiered in 2012 and is based on James Bond by Ian Fleming. The movie's screenplay is written by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan. The movie stars Daniel Craig as James Bond. James Bond must deal with a threat to MI6 from a former MI6 agent.Like the previous Daniel Craig James Bond movies, Skyfall is a movie that is trying to merge the older Bond movies into a modern spy movie. The plot centers around cyber terrorism, and the old spy methods being rendered irrelevant. The plot of this James Bond movie does stand out from the rest and it makes for a surprisingly unique experience. James Bond movies are criticized for always being the same. In this movie the plot is more relevant and it does cause the movie to feel more tense. The writing in this movie is one of the best parts of this movie and it is exemplified in the villain.Raoul Silva, played by Javier Bardem, is the villain in Skyfall. Raoul Silva is one of the most memorable villains in a James Bond movie. The movie can feel like it is contriving his cyber terrorism abilities, but it does make up for this by actually providing believable motivation for the villain's actions. Raoul Silva is motivated by his betrayal and disfigurement that was inadvertently caused by M. This is a far cry to the from the over the top villains in many previous James Bond movies. The motivation is not a ridiculous wish to dominate the world through a clandestine organization. The motivation is instead purely on revenge. Javier Bardem does a great job in the role. Javier Bardem is able to show a full range of emotions that Raoul Silva experiences. He also still has that smug attitude of superiority when dealing with James Bond. Raoul Silva had control of much of the movie and it was a joy to watch him on the screen. The chemistry that Raoul and James Bond had made the movie exciting.The directing by Sam Mendes and cinematography by Roger Deakins is impressive. This is an incredibly beautiful movie. This may be one of the most impressively shot and staged James Bond movies ever. There are so many great set-pieces such as a sequence in Shanghai and Macau. These set-pieces only get better with time and the ending in the Scottish highlands without any notable landmarks is still incredibly memorable in its presentation. I absolutely enjoyed all aspects of the production and it made a James Bond movie better on multiple viewings.James Bond has an excellent movie in its franchise in Skyfall This is an excellent movie for both fans of James Bond and new viewers to James Bond. I highly recommend Skyfall.Grade: A",9,0,3,9 March 2019
John Wick," Sweet stylish action
","This review contains spoilers.John Wick is an action movie that premiered in 2014. The movie is directed by Chad Stahelski, produced by Basil Iwanyk, David Leitch, Eva Longoria, Michael Witherill, written by Derek Kolstad, and starring Keanu Reeves. The movie is about a hitman's return to the criminal world after a tragedy befalls him.John Wick is a great action movie. The movie has many excellent action set pieces that are incredibly well choreographed and produced. The movie uses Keanu Reeves incredibly well in the lead role of John Wick. Keanu Reeves is able to portray the tough man and quick stylish action that the movie's direction requires. The movie has awesome scenes that are awe-inspiring to watch. It makes for a thrilling experience simply sitting through the 101 minutes of running time.Surprisingly for an action movie, John Wick has a compelling world. John Wick introduces the world of assassins to the audience and it is one of the most interesting worlds. Although there are many cliches that are used in this movie, the overall world seems interesting with its own culture, customs, and hierarchy. These customs come into full view about midway through the movie. It makes for an interesting when the movie uses these customs to dispatch of the villains.The characters in this movie are well-acted and are interesting. This movie gives character to every important player in the movie. This is surprising from an action movie. Of note is that John Wick is already a well known player in the world that had retired. Many of the characters that talk to John are already scared of his reputation. This results in dialogue that is unique to action movies where the characters already have a pre-existing relationship with the main character.I highly recommend 'John Wick'. This movie will please action junkies and it will also appease audiences looking for an interesting world.Grade: A",8,1,2,14 December 2019
Se7en," An engaging crime thriller
","This review contains spoilers.Seven premiered in 1995 and, is directed by David Fincher. The movie is written by Andrew Kevin Walker and stars Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. The movie is about a pair of police detectives that are tracking down a serial killer using the seven deadly sins as a modus operandi.Seven is an incredibly engaging movie. The movie's 127 minutes of running time moves at an incredible pace as it is bolstered by the tight directing by David Fincher. This movie is absolutely well-directed. David Fincher arranges every scene well and executes it well. The direction aids in the delivery of how each of the seven deadly sins are shown. Nothing as held back with the display of the deadly sins. David Fincher is able to show the audience the utter disgust represented by the sins. The investigator perspective is also clear and understood well.Both Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play detectives in the police named David Mills and William Somerset respectively. Both of these actors portray their characters well. Morgan Freeman as William Somerset is a soon to retire detective that is jaded by his experiences. David Mills is idealistic but and naive to the horrors in his job. These two characters play off of each other well and serve to take the audience along with them to solve the mystery. It is a pleasure trying to follow along with the detectives.The villain John Doe steals the show. Kevin Spacey plays the serial killer and it was awesome. The entire time from when he is introduced to the mystery being solved serves as the movie's climax. It is here that Kevin Spacey portrays the creepy serial killer and delivers chilling dialogue to the audience. The villain is helped greatly by the writing and serves to make the reveal of John Doe even more frightening. The movie does not introduce him until some of the other victims are already shown. This helps with the reveal as it finally shows this normal looking man as being truly psychotic.I would recommend Se7en. The movie is a solid crime thriller and is a great early David Fincher movie.Grade: B",8,0,0,31 December 2018
Unbreakable," Misleading Trailers and Misleading Marketing
","This review contains spoilers.Unbreakable is directed by M. Night Shyamalan and stars Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson. Unbreakable follows David Dunn, played by Bruce Willis, who discovers something about himself after a disaster. Along the way, a comic book collector played by Samuel L. Jackson advises David Dunn.Unbreakable had a poor marketing campaign. This movie had trailers that rode on M. Nigh Shyamalan's previous movie, The Sixth Sense's tone and theme. This movie is not anything like what the trailers may suggest. Unbreakable is not a psychological thriller like The Sixth Sense. Instead Unbreakable is actually a classic hero story told with a twist. The movie is actually a superhero origin story. The movie presents the hero as unaware of his own superpowers until Elijah Price advises him.Unbreakable presents a character that the audience can follow and care about. David Dunn is a great character and Elijah Price plays an excellent foil. Bruce Willis has natural charisma in the role, and is believable in trying to discover his abilities. Samuel L. Jackson has a mysterious presence and he brings out emotions that the audience may not expect.This movie does have some problems. Some of its directing is bland and it overuses flashbacks and subtitles. An example of this is its epilogue where the story continues in text, even when the plot had already reached an appropriate conclusion. There is sadly not a good way to tell the origin story of this movie without the flashbacks without sacrificing its own plot and character motivations.I recommend Unbreakable. Even watching it in the 2010s, the movie does not have common patterns found in typical superhero origin stories such as the Marvel movies. This is an original movie with a great twist.Grade: B",7,0,0,14 June 2020
Darkest Hour," Period movie
","This review contains spoilers.Darkest Hour is a historical movie set in Britain during World War 2. The movie follows Winston Churchill as he becomes Prime Minister of the British Empire as it faces its biggest crisis in its history. The events that the movie covers are: Nevill Chamberlain's resignation, Churchill's ascent to prime minister, the battle of France, the surrender of France, and the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Forces. Gary Oldman portrays the lead character bringing the historical figure to life.Darkest Hour is a great period movie for any audiences that are interested in the era. Gary Oldman and the rest of the cast does an excellent job bringing the dark times of the British Empire alive on the screen. Every scene feels authentic with performances and history being doled out in small amounts. The history can be dry and uninteresting for some, but for anyone looking for a good historical movie can do no wrong with Darkest Hour. Although I cannot comment on the historical accuracy, the movie has the authenticity one would expect from a high budget movie.I would recommend Darkest Hour to any audience interested in the politics and social situation of the British Empire at the start of World War 2. It features a dazzling performance from Gary Oldman and authentic sets.Grade: B",7,0,0,3 July 2020
The Maze Runner," Young-Adult Movie
","This review contains spoilers.The Maze Runner is a dystopian science fiction movie that premiered in 2014. The movie is directed by Wes Ball and is based on the novel The Maze Runner by James Dashner. The movie stars Dylan O'Brien, Kaya Scodelario, and Thomas Brodie-Sangster. The movie follows a group of young adults that are trapped in a maze. All of the boys are young adults and have no memory of how they got to the maze. The group must solve the mystery of the maze and exit the trap.The Maze Runner is a quintessential young adult movie. There are many tropes that are found in the young adult movie. The movie plays these tropes straight. This is not a movie for audiences that are expecting something different in the young adult genre. The movie genuinely plays these tropes straight with its protagonists and plot structure. The movie is not boring as the mystery in the movie is still exciting to watch.The movie is well made with the effects and cinematography at a high standard. The sets and acting are surprisingly well done. I normally expect movies such as this to be a lower production but The Maze Runner did a good job with creating the traps and shifting maze. It made for a good experience as the movie dazzled the audience with its effects and urgency in the protagonists.The movie's plot and mystery is not explained by the end of the movie. Although I liked the mystery, I felt that the movie's end only raised more questions as to how the group ended up in the maze. I felt that this was the disappointing part of the movie as the movie did not want to answer any of the mysteries that the story had setup. It required the audience to be invested in the sequel which from the ending of the movie does not seem as interesting as this movie.I would recommend 'The Maze Runner'.Grade: C",5,0,0,28 December 2019
Memento," An examination of mental illness
","This review contains spoilers.Memento is directed by Christopher Nolan and stars Guy Pierce. Guy Pierce plays an investigator called Leonard as he tries to find his wife's killer. Leonard cannot form any new memories as he embarks on this quest. It is this disability that causes Leonard to come into contention with characters that knew him in the past.Memento requires the audience to be patient as the beginning of the movie can appear convoluted. The movie is edited in a way to not play the scenes in chronological order. The movie also interplays flashbacks of Leonard before his condition and of an old insurance case he investigated. The movie wants the audience to stay but it is difficult to continue if they are not interested in the mystery. The mystery is fun to follow and many plot elements that are introduced in the opening scene is followed up by the end of the movie.Memento is not a complicated movie, but it is told in a complicated way. With the backwards narrative to allow the audience to journey through Leonard's condition, the audience can relate to the confusion of Leonard. They can also form an overall narrative for the movie. The audience can judge each of the characters that Leonard interacts with by remembering key details of what he says. Memento is still flowed, but its gimmick of a backwards narrative is still engaging.I would recommend Memento to any mystery thriller fan.Grade: B",8,1,2,3 March 2018
Underworld," A slick action thriller

The movie is about a secret war between Vampires and Lycans. The movie follows Selene, a vampire Death Dealer, that discover a Lycan plot.Underworld has riveting action scenes that are fun and stylistic to watch. These action scenes have a great gothic style to the scenes. These action scenes are also headlined with a good performance by Kate Beckinsale. The action in this movie are incredibly visceral and gory to watch. The action scenes are a big plus to this movie.The movie's world and characters are interesting. The movie does well with its dialogue and history. The movie spending the time to do this is a nice change of pace as the movie uses it as a break between the action scenes. It is nice to see the characters have an actual history with one another that should have been expanded upon further.The movie is vapid in its plot and characters. I wish that the movie focused on the character history more than the strange plot. The plot seemed like it wanted to be an excuse to have action and a reasonable plot. The movie made many strange concessions to have both. The movie should have been more of an action movie or a plot driven movie and not both. There are still some
good scenes in this movie.Overall I would recommend Underworld.Grade: B",7,2,2,17 November 2018
Captain Marvel," Cool visuals boring story
","This review contains spoilers.'Captain Marvel is a superhero action movie that features the Marvel comics character Carol Davners. The movie is directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck. The movie stars Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson. The movie takes place in 1995 as Carol Danvers becomes involved in an intergalactic conflict.Captain Marvel is a pretty movie. The visual in this movie are incredibly well done. The stunts and action are also well choreographed and impressive. The side characters are all acted well and contribute meaningfully to the overall plot. The movie became an adequate movie if the audience wants to view it as a summer action movie.Any audience expecting the movie to veer outside of the Marvel movie formula will be disappointed. This movie plays it safe. Outside of making the main character played by Brie Larson, this movie does nothing unique. The movie is a prequel to much of the Marvel cinematic universe and many things introduced in this movie are not hinted at in the earlier released movies. This movie absolutely suffers from lack of connection to the overall Marvel cinematic universe outside of a connection to Nick Fury. I am expecting that the movie will have elements followed up on by its sequel.Captain Marvel is a bland character. Brie Larson did the best job that she could have in this movie. Brie Larson is not a bad actress. Her previous movies showed she has acting range and emotions to be put on the screen. In this movie, the writing makes her out to be a robot and it is hard to tell when they are being intentional about this plot point. The beginning of the movie has Captain Marvel or Carol Danvers arrive on Earth and begin understanding humans. Even towards the end, Carol Danvers still appeared robotic. The other flaw seems like Carol is too invincible. She does not appear to have any flaws and the movie plays this up.Some of the writing seems strange. Carol Danvers got her superpowers in an accident that also gave her amnesia. The amnesia explanation by the other members of the Kree force do not make sense. It seems like the better explanation would have been to lie to Carol Danvers and say she was undercover in Earth then an accident happened. This would have explained the visions she has of the crash. It would have also explained the connection she had to Earth. This entire explanation did not make sense as it stood in the movie.Even with the flaws in the writing, I would still recommend 'Captain Marvel.' This is a solid superhero action movie.Grade: C",6,1,2,10 August 2019
Iron Man 2," A familiar successor
","This review contains spoilers.Iron Man 2 is a superhero action movie that premiered in 2010. The movie is directed Jon Favreau, with screenplay by Justin Theroux. The movie is based on the character Iron Man by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, Don Heck, and Jack Kirby. The movie stars Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, and Scarlett Johansson. Iron Man 2 is the sequel to 2008's Iron Man and takes place sometime after the conclusion of the first movie.Iron Man 2 follows the same formula and procedure as the first Iron Man movie. It is an incredibly familiar sequel and it does not stray from the overall formula that the first movie set out. Iron Man 2 follows Tony Stark with Robert Downey Jr. reprising the role. Robert Downey Jr. continues his great performance of the billionaire inventor and watching him in the role is always welcome. The movie focuses more on the supporting cast much more than the first movie does. There is an emphasis on Pepper Potts, James 'Rhodey' Rhodes, and Natasha Romanov in this movie.The story of this movie is fairly generic. I felt that the movie's main purpose was to introduce more of the Marvel characters to the audience rather than crafting a satisfying movie. The universe is interesting with its massive potential scope but it came at the cost of making the villains in this movie interesting. The main villain in this movie is Ivan Vanko played by Mickey Rourke. Besides some incredibly select scenes, Ivan Vanko is not allowed much room to develop as a character. The backstory of the villain is interesting as a person that was wronged by Stark industries in the past. This however is the only mileage that the villain gets. Mickey Rourke did an admirable job but the script was simply not there for the character to thrive. There is too much to get done in the 125 minutes of running time of this movie.The movie does setup the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe by the end of the movie. This was absolutely Iron Man 2's goal as they wanted more characters and heroes to be known by the audience. The movie attempts to do too much in the story. The movie had to craft a compelling villain, a continuation of Tony Stark's story and also an expansion into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. All of these does not bear fruit at the same time and it shows in this movie. The great action and effects that audiences enjoyed in the first movie is still here. The full package of story and narrative is not.I would still recommend 'Iron Man 2' despite its story problems.Grade: C",6,0,0,4 January 2020
Alien: Resurrection," Departing from the previous installments
","This review contains spoilers.Alien Resurrection is a science fiction horror movie that premiered in 1997. The movie is directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and with the story written by Joss Whedon. The movie stars Sigourney Weaver as Ripley 8, a clone of the original Ripley and Winona Ryder as Annalee Call. The movie is a follow up to 1992's Alien 3. Ripley is cloned and Weyland-Yutani continues to raise the Xenomorphs.Alien Resurrection is an extremely contrived movie. These is not any reason for this movie to exist other than to create another Alien movie. This movie contrived a ridiculous way to bring back the Xenomorphs. The belief that a clone can contain the Alien embryo is ridiculous and harms the believability of the movie. The movie feels incredibly superfluous because of this aspect.Sigourney Weaver feels weathered from the movie. The script does not give her many opportunities to have a varied performance. Instead the movie uses Ripley as a stoic superhuman which has never been the case in the past Alien movies. This departure is one of the reasons why the movie could not live up to the strengths of the previous installments in the Alien franchise.The story uses the survival elements of the first two movies but it does not execute it well. The movie has a surprising amount of slapstick comedy that is ill fitting for this movie. I did not appreciate that this element was in the movie and it made for a movie that appeared to be parodying the original movies rather than continuing the horror genre.The newer characters do try to give it their all in this movie. However, it is not enough to save the script from being average to bad at best. The movie has few redeeming factors and I wish that it was enough to save the movie.I would not recommend Alien Resurrection.Grade: C",5,0,1,7 March 2020

The movie premiered in 2004 and is about a zombie apocalypse in London from the perspective of a TV salesman without much direction in his life. The movie primarily follows Shaun, played by Simon Pegg, and Ed played by Nick Frost as they navigate the zombie apocalypse.This movie is a cult classic. There are countless hilarious scenes that this movie has. There is a wide array of humor here as there are funny dumb moments and funny moments with a long pay off. The humor in the movie does die down in the later parts of the movie with character deaths. This is luckily helped by the good direction in the latter half of the movie. The movie also paces its humor out well as the movie's scenes have many fun small touches that might only be seen by the audience on a second watch. One of the scenes that had me in tears was Shaun walking through the neighborhood after the zombie apocalypse in a mirror of an earlier scene. The movie is filled with these moments that make the movie incredibly enjoyable.Edgar Wright's direction is certainly helpful in this movie. The film moves at an electric pace matched by the electric direction and editing. It was even a joy watching the more mundane parts of Shaun and Ed's lives. The cutting style in this movie helped a lot with making every moment seem fun. I do not think I was ever bored throughout the 99 minutes of running time in the movie. There is not a scene or dialogue wasted in this movie.The main leads of Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Kate Ashfield work incredibly well. These actors have great comedic timing and delivery. It is definitely easy to root for Shaun to prevail as he is this lovable buffoon.The plot of the movie is basic. Anyone that has watched Dawn of the Dead or any mainstream zombie movie can predict the story. Shaun of the Dead does not do anything new to the zombie genre story wise. The newness comes from the comedy in the movie.Shaun of the Dead is an incredibly well done movie, I highly recommend the movie to both audiences that do not like the zombie genre and existing fans. The movie is one of 2004's highlights.Grade: A",9,0,0,22 December 2018
Knives Out," An excellent written mystery
","This review contains spoilers.Knives Out is a mystery movie that premiered in 2019. The movie is directed, written, and produced by Rian Johnson. The movie stars Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, and Ana de Armas. A wealthy crime novelist is found dead and the leading cause is suicide. A famous private detective by the name of Benoit Blanc, played by Daniel Craig, is invited to investigate the death.Knives Out is a great mystery that has many positive attributes. Knives Out's primary attribute is its snazzy writing. The writing is incredibly energetic and done well by Rian Johnson. The writing is the main draw to this story as the audience tries to piece together the mystery. Harlan Thrombey died after a family reunion which did not go perfectly. The story gradually uncovers facts such as the nurse Marta having accidentally killed Harlan. The movie unfolds these mysteries incredibly well and uses aspects such as Marta's inability to lie to great effect.
Ana de Armas as Marta Cabrera is an excellent actress in the role. She portrays the nurse that needs to stay one step ahead of the investigation incredibly. I found that all the scenes with her portrayed the desperation, humor, and deviousness in a way that was refreshing to see. Marta Cabrera had a funny innocence to the character as the mystery unfolded and she discovered she was being used.The main highlight in the movie is Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc. The private detective has a southern drawl that is played to great effect by Daniel Craig. The movie uses this character effectively as Marta frequently tries to get ahead of the private investigator. I enjoyed all the scenes with Benoit Blanc and it is easy to get lost in the character's charm. Even when the character is acting lazily this is entertaining to watch.I would recommend 'Knives Out'.Grade: B",8,1,1,2 May 2020
The Irishman," A sweeping epic
","This review contains spoilers.The Irishman is a 2019 American epic crime movie. The movie is directed by Martin Scorcese and is based on the book I Heard You Paint Houses by Charles Brandt. The movie stars Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci. A delivery truck driver, Frank Sheeran, in Philadelphia sells the contents of his truck to a crime family. This introduces Frank Sheeran to the world of organized crime.The Irishman is a wide sweeping epic crime movie. This movie paints a broad stroke with its 209 minutes of running time. This running time tells an epic story across the 1950s all the way to the early 1990s. The story follows Frank Sheeran and his interactions with the crime families and Jimmy Hoffa. This story is grand in scope and the movie executes this incredibly well. The actors and actresses have ageing and de-ageing technology that is applied to their faces. As the years continue they also act according to their age. It makes for an involved story as the audience can see that characters ageing before their eyes. It also reflects the changing nature of the characters as motivations and goals change.The relationship between Frank Sheeran and Jimmy Hoffa is reflected incredibly well in this movie. The movie centers on this relationship as the movie unfolds. Both Robert De Niro and Al Pacino as Frank Sheeran and Jimmy Hoffa are believable and astounding in their roles. I bought into their relationship and it was painful that Frank Sheeran had to kill Jimmy Hoffa. Up until that point Frank Sheeran came to a respectful relation with Jimmy Hoffa and vice-versa. The two men and their families have chemistry on the screen. They also care about one another.The directing in this movie is not as electric as other Martin Scorcese movies. This movie is much more flat in its direction than the movies such as Goodfellas or The Departed. I felt that the direction could be improved but the direction ultimately has the grand scope that makes the movie involved.I would recommend 'The Irishman'. The length of this movie is definitely felt by any audience. However any audience that is willing to watch this movie needs to be patient and in the mood for a slow-burning story.Grade: B",8,1,2,30 May 2020
Finding Nemo," Colorful and exciting
","This review contains spoilers'Finding Nemo' is a computer-animated movie that premiered in 2003. The movie is produced by Pixar Animation Studios. The movie is directed by Andrew Stanton. The story is also written by Andrew Stanton. The screenplay is by Andrew Stanton, Bob Peterson, and David Reynolds. The movie stars the voices of Albert Books, Ellen DeGeneres, and Alexander Gould. The movie is about a clownfish father that searches for his son Nemo.Finding Nemo is a great animated movie for all audiences. This movie successfully blends humor for adults and children across its entire running time. There are so many great jokes and moments that will appeal to adults and children alike. This movie seamlessly transitions the plot and the writing to appeal to both of the audiences. This is still a rated G movie, but I am impressed with how much the movie could have moments that engage adults.The three stars in this movie do a fantastic job. Albert Books as the overprotective clownfish father and Ellen DeGeneres as a forgetful Dory make for a great duo as they set out to look for Nemo. Alexander Gould as Nemo has great moments especially once he reaches the dentist tank. The cast do a great job and it shows on the screen. Even if they are animated on the screen, their voices have great emotion.This movie does not have any villains. Any antagonist in this movie simply misunderstands the situation that the fish are in. This leads into situations where I cannot say that the movie fails to engage despite a lack of a villain. The obstacles that Marvin and Dory find themselves in are caused by the adventure and not a villain seeking to undermine them. It made for a stronger story overall as the characters tried to work together rather than be antagonistic to Marvin, Dory, or Nemo.The animation in this movie still holds up today in 2019. Even if the visuals are dated, I did not feel this detracted from the experience much. The main appeal is the plot and character. The visuals are more of a nice addition. There are still grand sequences in this movie like the current ride.I would recommend 'Finding Nemo.' This is an excellent animated movie for all audiences.Grade: A",9,0,0,8 June 2019
Hot Fuzz," A rousing and pleasing buddy cop movie
","This review contains spoilers.Hot Fuzz is a buddy cop action movie directed by Edgar Wright and written by Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg. The movie stars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost in the leading roles. A police constable named Nicholas Angel, played by Simon Pegg, is an overachieving officer in London. He is promoted to a remote village where the crime-rate is virtually non-existent. Throughout the movie, Nicholas Angel uncovers evidence of foul-play in Sandford, the remote village.Hot Fuzz is another cult classic movie from Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost. This movie owes many homages from older buddy. cop movies. The entire movie is made by people that enjoy these movies as well as wanting to create something new in that genre. This movie is made by the admirers of the buddy cop genre and it really shows.Edgar Wright Knocks it out of the park with the direction and editing. The movie is similar to Shaun of the Dead with its quick cuts and overall direction. This is good as the direction also plays to the movie's strengths of the mysterious Sandford and the hilarious neighborhood. This is a fairly lengthy movie compared to Shann of the Dead at 121 minutes of running time. There are absolutely more story events, and characters. This works in the film's favor as many of the movie's entertaining moments are aided by the length. The movie's introduction of the Neighborhood Watch Alliance leads to many funny moments later in the movie.Much like Shaun of the Dead, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost play partners in the police force of Sandford. These two actors have good chemistry and it is different from Shaun of the Dead. Nick Frost plays Police Constable Daniel 'Danny' Butterman. Danny Butterman is a buffoon and not suited to police work. He has an infatuation with buddy cop movies and it shows throughout the movie. These two characters handle much of the boredom in the countryside of Sandford. The interaction between these two characters are so fun to watch that I am glad the movie was as long as it was.The rest of the cast does a great job as well. The highlight is Timothy Dalton playing Simon Skinner. Simon Skinner is so fun to watch as the grocery store owner constantly harassing Nicholas Angel in his investigations. This character is introduced and is handled so well throughout the entire running time that I enjoyed every moment that he was on the screen. Simon Skinner's slimyness is reflected incredibly well by Timothy Dalton.The plot of the movie is at a great level. There is a mystery in Sandford and the revelation is well worth it. The mystery's revelation had me in stitches as Nicholas Angel, came up with much better reasons for the murders than the culprits did. That entire scene is worth the build-up for the entire movie. If there are any weaknesses in the movie it would be the slow build-up.The movie does not feature many action scenes. This is narratively appropriate but the trailers make the movie more action-packed than it really is. On multiple watches, this movie's lack of action does not bother me as much as it did at first. There is still a lengthy action scene at the very end where every trope from buddy cop action movies is used.I highly recommend Hot Fuzz. Not only is this movie a great homage, but it is also a great movie.Grade: A",9,0,0,23 December 2018
The Mummy," Excellent action adventure
","This review contains spoilers.The Mummy is an action horror movie that premiered in 1999. The movie is written and directed by Stephen Sommers and stars Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz. The movie is about an ancient mummy that is awakened and must be banished once again. The movie features an American archaeologist played by Brendan Fraser that leads the discovery and eventual banishment of the ancient mummy.The Mummy is a great movie that combines adventure and action. The movie can be tense at times and the movie is fantastic in its focus on the mummy. Imhotep the mummy, played by Arnold Vosloo, does a fantastic job. He offers tension and great action scenes in his portrayal of the cursed mummy. The movie is incredibly tight in its 125 minutes of running time and it uses all of it to focus on either the main characters or villain. There is not much fluff in this movie.The main stars of Brendan Fraser as Rick O'Connell and Rachel Weisz as Evelyn Carnahan do a great job in the leading roles. It was really funny at times following the band of adventurers as they find treasure and clues to unraveling the mystery of the mummy. Brendan Fraser in particular is a breath of fresh air at the time and created a great genre of action adventure movies. Evelyn Carnahan is the love interest of the main character but actually has expertise to provide in the movie.The computer generated imagery aged remarkably well for its time. This movie uses its computer generated imagery sparsely when it can and it makes for a better movie overall. The budget of 80 million US dollars shines well in this movie and it makes for an overall solid production.I would recommend 'The Mummy'.Grade: B",7,0,0,28 September 2019
Terminator Salvation," Unfocused
","This review contains spoilers.'Terminator Salvation' is the sequel to Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. The movie was released in 2009. The fourth installment to the Terminator franchise is directed by McG, written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris, and stars Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Anton Yelchin, and Moon Bloodgood. The movie takes place after Judgment Day and takes place during the opening years of the war between the Resistance and Skynet.Terminator Salvation does its best in trying to present the war against the machines in the fourth installment of the movie. This does not make for an excellent movie. The movie meanders along and the promise of the apocalyptic fight with John Connor against the machines. The movie does not offer any satisfying conclusion. It simply presents events and tries to expand the backstory with the Terminator franchise. The ending in this movie resembles a sitcom where the characters are more or less in the same position they were from the start of the movie. This is the biggest detraction on the entire movie.The action and production in this movie are overall solid. There is a disappointment in the color choices for this movie as any of the futuristic scenes in Terminator 2: Judgment Day do not come into view here. Terminator Salvation is encompassed by brown and light hues from the desert scenes. The dark and blue scenes from Terminator 2: Judgment Day is not present here. It makes for a disappointing experience as it feels like the movie is not fulfilling its promise from the earlier movies.The characters in this movie are overall solid. John Connor, played by Christian Bale, has the intensity that fans of the series would expect. The casting of John Connor is great and he is easily one of the hallmarks of the movie. Sam Worthington plays Marcus Wright, a human-terminator hybrid. He does an appreciable job but his character had too much screen time. It felt like the movie wanted to have a cinematic universe of Terminators, rather than trying to tell a good stand-alone movie. I felt that the movie should have focused on Marcus Wright and had John Connor in a smaller role if this was what the movie wanted to go for. This puts the movie in a tough position as the movies have always been about the terminators and the Connor family. The movie fails to be both a movie about John Connor and Marcus Wright. They should have done one or the other and not both.It is hard to recommend Terminator Salvation. The movie has too many flaws even though the action is solid. I would not recommend 'Terminator Salvation'.Grade: D",6,0,0,4 July 2019
Aquaman," Impressive visuals
","This review contains spoilers.Aquaman is a superhero movie directed by Justin Lin. The movie based off of the DC Comics character Aquaman. The movie stars Jason Mamoa in the titular role. Amber Heard plays an Atlantean that assists Aquaman in claiming his destiny.Aquaman is an incredibly silly movie. This movie does not take itself seriously. There are many scenes in this moine that have ridiculous visuals or soundtracks. Two examples is an octopus playing the drums and the song 'Africa' played once the two leading characters are flying over Africa. There is no way that this movie is meant to be taken seriously. This also makes the movie more entertaining as a result. The movie does not restrict itself to the serious Aquaman in Justice League which makes this movie have a lighter tone.The story in this movie is non-existent. The plot is only an excuse to have dazzling set pieces and impressive visuals. The movie tells Arthur Curry, or Aqnaman's story from his mother's affair with his father and his youth. There is much in this movie that felt like filler or an excuse to show cool effects or costumes. The flashback scenes to Arthur Curry's youth, felt bloated even if it is fitting for the story. The story and characters are all bloated as the story stays simple. Even the villain that is introduced at the beginning of the movie becomes utterly irrelevant towards the end. The Manta had no purpose at all to the overall plot.The visuals are the best part of this movie. The movie's effort and budget clearly went to this part of the movie. Every scene has fantastic visuals. I was surprised that every scene had better visuals than the last. The scenes have these great effects and costumes. Not only that but the direction by Justin Lin makes the action scenes much more exciting. There is frequently a 360 degrees turn as the action moves on the screen. The movie has so many great action scenes that it makes the movie worthwhile to watch. There is no awesome action scene but many small action scenes. The action scenes are one of the reasons to watch this movie. The other reason is the funny script.I would recommend 'Aquaman'. Although the movie has its flaws, the sharp humor and great visuals are worth the price of admission.Grade: B",7,1,1,9 February 2019

Weber. The movie stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Zooey Deschanel. The movie uses a non-linear narrative that unfolds across its 95 minute running time. The movie is about a romantic engagement across the 500 days that the two are involved. The movie has the audience discover how the relationship collapsed.500 Days of Summer is an energetically directed movie. This movie has a fun style across its running time. Marc Webb does a good job with the direction in this movie. It provides an interesting retrospective into what the character of Tom Hansen is thinking when he reminisces about Summer. There are many fun stylized and fantastical scenes in this movie that is played straight by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. This adds much to the movie's lightning pace and it makes the movie easy to follow from an emotional point of view.500 Days of Summer is a rather basic movie. Aside from its unique presentation, the movie has a generic plot. 500 Days of Summer wants to utilize this to improve the overall movie experience. If the audience looks past this, they see a rather generic movie about a relationship and a breakup. The relationship is still interesting at times and Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel do a great job in their roles. It is the case that the movie does not do a great job with the overall plot.I would recommend '500 Days of Summer.'Grade: B",8,1,3,22 June 2019
The Terminator," Classic science fiction movie
","This review contains spoilers.'The Terminator' is a science fiction movie that premiered in 1984. The movie is directed by James Cameron and written by James Cameron, and Gale Anne Hurd. The movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Biehn, and Linda Hamilton. The movie is about a cyborg assassin sent back in time to kill a mother before she gives birth to a son that will win the war against the machines.The Terminator is a solid science fiction action movie. There are many great action scenes across its 107 minutes of running time. The movie uses the action scenes to great effect by tying it in with the plot. The action is not loud and dumb but makes sense for what the movie is trying to convey. None of the action scenes are too over the top as they make sense for a resistance fighter in Kyle Reese played by Michael Biehn to be trying to stop a futuristic cyborg. The movie has the characters utilize commonly available transportation and weapons to battle the cyborg. Likewise, the terminator played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, utilizes everything it can to track down and terminate Sarah Connor. The cyborg has a logical pattern to track down and kill the mother. The plan made sense and it was interesting to watch scenes from the cyborg's point of view.The performances by the main cast in Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, and Michael Biehn are excellent. Arnold plays the robotic cyborg incredibly well. There is not much range to be expected but he is able to convey the action scenes well. Linda Hamilton is great as Sarah Connor. She starts as a waitress that must ascend to protecting the future. This arc is a classic one in storytelling and it makes for an interesting shift in the formula by making the entire journey a self-fulfilling prophecy. Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese does an excellent job attempting to protect and save Sarah Connor. As a futuristic resistance fighter, he is portrayed on the screen as a fish out of water when he is in the past.The action in the movie is great in both the visual and audio effects. There are many practical effects that the movie uses and it adds much to the overall movie. I enjoyed that the movie was produced with a rather grounded use of props and vehicles. Nothing felt out of place in this movie. The action set pieces are incredibly solid.The movie does have interesting questions that it asks. The movie utilizes time travel as a plot device. In many cases, time travel can ruin the plot. In this movie, the time travel is a centerpiece of this story. The entire reason why the future happens is because of the time traveling cyborg and resistance fighter. The events in the future simply would not have happened if both of these characters did not time travel. The movie likes to ask this question about the time paradox and does not present an answer. It makes the movie stronger as a result as it appeared the world was in a loop.I highly recommend 'The Terminator.'Grade: A",8,1,2,22 June 2019
BlacKkKlansman," A dramatized and fun account
",This review contains spoilers.Blackkklansman is a biographical movie directed by Spike Lee. The movie stars John David Washington and Adam Driver as police defectives in Colorado Springs. The two investigate the Ku Klux Klan chapter in Colorado Springs. Eventually the detectives discover a dangerous plan they must thwart.The movie relies heavily on John David Washington as Ron Stallworth and Adam Driver as Flip Zimmerman. This is a good thing as these two leads compose a great center of the movie. I enjoyed any scene that these two actors were in. I enjoyed that both of these characters had to play Ron Stallworth for the Ku Klux Klan chapter. Adam Driver is becoming a master class actor as he is able to play many roles.The story of Blackkklansman is engrossing. Watching the police infiltration of the Ku Klux Klan and Ron Stallworth ascending the ranks is exciting. Even the police dynamic with the real Ron Stallworth and the Colorado Springs police department is fun to watch. The movie's plot and pacing is not without problems.The opening and closing scenes of the movie are out of place. The movie opened with Alec Baldwin playing Dr. Kennebrew Beauregard giving a bigoted speech about African Americans. The movie ends with Ron and Patrice seeing a burning cross on a distant hillside. I felt that these scenes are not necessary. The opening scene did not add anything to the movie except to set the tone that the rest of the movie already sets. This is also the same with the closing scene as the end cuts to scenes of the Charlottesville's Unite the Right rally. I feel that the movie would have been more powerful if it had ended on the burning cross. The audience could have made the connection on their own. As it stands the opening and closing scenes are too blunt and offer nothing to the movie's plot.I would recommend Blackkklansman.Grade: B,7,1,7,13 October 2018

","This review contains spoilers.The Return of the Jedi is episode six of the Star Wars saga. This movie is the sequel to 1980's The Empire Strikes Back and marks the concluding movie to the original trilogy. The movie picks up one year after the events of The Empire Strikes Back. Luke Skywalker has completed his Jedi training. The remaining rebels have banded together in an attempt to destroy the Empire once and for all.The Return of the Jedi is a weak entry in the Star Wars original trilogy. This is still a good movie and conclusion to the original trilogy. The movie fully realizes the conclusion to Luke Skywalker's character arc by having him redeem his father in Lord Vader. This character arc can be strange to watch as Luke seemingly abandons any logic in an attempt to save his father from the dark side. I still liked this story and its conclusion.All the familiar characters from, the previous two movies return here. Like Luke they have satisfying conclusions to their characters. Han Solo's romance with Princess Leia reaches its conclusion. The main focus is still on Luke Skywalker's story arc.The movie itself is shot well, with the overall cinematography at a good standard. The sound design is at a high standard here. The soundtrack is nice with the highlight being Luke Skywalker's duel with Darth Vader.There are elements of the story that do not make sense. I enjoyed the character of the emperor but his creation of a second Death Star is a horrible rehash of the first part of the original trilogy. The entire movie leads up to the confrontation on the second Death Star and Endor. It is the confrontation that leaves much to be desired. The movie could have been more creative.Even with the minor flaws, I still recommend Star Wars: Episode VI - The Return of the Jedi.Grade: A",8,1,2,20 October 2018

The movie stars Tom Skerritt and Sigourney Weaver. A commercial space ship, the Nostromo, is on a return journey when it picks up a distress transmission. The crew of the Nostromo investigates the derelict ship.Alien is a classic science fiction movie and a classic horror movie. The movie has great pacing across the 117 minutes of running time. The movie has a great lead in Sigourney Weaver playing Ripley. The warrant officer is the audience's anchor to trying to understand and deal with the growing threat of the xenomorph. The entire movie has an interesting universe as the crew of the Nostromo have to fight against the technology and the xenomorph.The story of Alien is incredibly basic. The crew of the Nostromo simply find an alien derelict ship and then attempt to deal with the extraterrestrial on their own ship. The entire running time is spent with the crew dealing with the monster. In this way the movie is similar to a slasher movie however the movie has science-fiction themes that help elevate the movie to more of a slasher movie. The themes of cosmic horror and greed permeate through this movie. The corporation wanted to obtain the alien even at the cost of the crew's lives. The crew and the corporate android are in over their heads as the alien has the upperhand. The creature could not be controlled and it was not understood. The movie focused on the drama within the crew instead of utilizing them for gratuitous violence.The creature and the movie is a classic and should be watched for any fans of horror science-fiction.I would recommend Alien.Grade: A",9,2,3,22 February 2020
Barry Lyndon," A grand period adventure

The story is based on The Luck of Barry Lyndon by William Makepeace Thackeray. The movie stars Ryan O'Neal and Marisa Berenson. The movie centers around the life of Barry Lyndon. The movie tells the tale of Redmond Barry's early life culminating in his marriage to the Countess of Lyndon. The movie is a sprawling 187 minute running time epic.Barry Lyndon is an excellent movie. This movie is magnificently directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. The best attribute of the movie is that it is incredibly beautiful. The movie uses natural lighting in its shots. There is a staggering number of shots that are utterly gorgeous to look at. This movie bases its shots on old 18th century paintings and it absolutely shows in the movie. The movie's production quality is incredibly high with props, and dresses being of immaculate quality. It made for the movie being one of the best produced movies in the 1970s.The story in this movie tells a grand tale across the 18th century. The movie mainly takes the perspective of Redmond Barry as he transitions from Redmond Barry to Barry Lyndon. The movie focuses on the scoundrel of Barry as he seeks to elevate his social standing. Although the audience may not always agree with Barry, the scoundrel has enough charisma to make the adventure enjoyable. It made the adventure into an exciting morally gray zone. The movie has two main acts in Barry's rise and eventually his fall.Both of the acts are incredibly fun to watch. The first act is more centered on Redmond Barry's rise. He has many misadventures that are incredibly fun to watch. Redmond Barry goes on a massive adventure across Europe as he fights in the Seven Years War. Eventually he encounters the Chevalier. This entire event makes a massive difference in Redmond Barry's life as he is able to change from a scoundrel gambler into someone poised to elevate his standing in society.The second act is not as action packed as the first act. It centers around Barry's rise in nobility and eventual downturn. It makes for an exciting story as the second act has Barry at his worst that eventually destroys Barry's reputation. There are glimmers of Barry's roguish charm and his innocent nature that show in this second act. It made for an interesting act as the audience needs to grapple with whether they should sympathize with Barry or if he is deserving of his fate.Barry Lyndon is a character and period driven movie that can be incredibly moving at times. It is however a slow movie that requires setup in order to drive its effectiveness for the viewer. This can make the movie seem too slow but I believe that the payoff is worth it. The movie has gorgeous visuals that can enrapture the audience. Barry Lyndon is a one-of-a-kind movie that is not often produced by large studios.I highly recommend 'Barry Lyndon'. This is a solid movie that demands patience from the audience.Grade: A",9,1,2,31 August 2019

The movie follows Forrest Gump, played by Tom Hanks, a mentally challenged man as a child to an adult. The story begins with Forrest telling his story to random strangers at a bus stop.Forrest Gump is an entertaining movie. The movie's pacing is incredibly quick and there is never a dull moment. It is astonishing to see so much of Forrest's life displayed on the screen. Each stage of Forrest's life has its own struggles and stories contributes so well to Forrest's story. A lot of this is because Robert Zemeckis' fine direction and Tom Hanks' engagement into his character. Tom Hanks narrates all of the flashbacks and often times narration does not offer much over the visuals; here in the scenes, Forrest's narration helps keep the scenes engaging. A lot of this is also helped by the pacing which keeps every stage fresh.Forrest Gump follows many small stories from Forrest's youth with his inability to run to his time in the Vietnam War. All of these stories have meaning to Forrest and because of this the movie can stand on this alone. Forrest's first story with his inability to walk properly helps the audience get behind Forrest's struggles. It becomes easy to root for Forrest after seeing him overcome his disability. This continues throughout the movie and the story does touch on some surprising emotional notes.Forrest Gump has a great soundtrack. Each period of time has period appropriate music and the movie absolutely benefits as a result.Forrest Gump is highly recommended. The movie is a complete package with wonderful directing and an excellent lead actor. This movie has something for everyone to enjoy in it like a box of chocolates.Grade: A",8,1,1,21 June 2018

The movie is directed by Joe Johnston, with the screenplay written by Christopher Markus, and Stephen McFeely. The movie stars Chris Evans, Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving, and Hayley Atwell. The movie follows Steve Rogers as he attempts to enlist in the United States military during World War Two.Captain America: The First Avenger is a solid origin story for Captain America. All of the pieces of an origin story are here in this movie. The movie has visuals, action, character, and solid casting. The movie also has a memorable villain in Red Skull played by Hugo Weaving. There are some deficiencies in the movie that detract from the experience.The story in this movie has weird beats. The movie focuses on Steve Rogers but it had to inject the Nazi organization of Hydra. Hydra is the classic villainous organization that the heroes always find themselves fighting against. The movie spends much of the story building up Steve Rogers for the confrontation against Hydra to be over quickly. The rogue organization of Hydra does not have as much characterization for an organization that is so strong in the 1940s. It felt quick that as soon as Steve Rogers entered the scene to fight against Hydra the main headquarters and bases are destroyed.Captain America: The First Avenger, like its previously released movie in the cinematic universe Iron Man 2, builds up the cinematic universe of Marvel. In this way, I felt that the movie had much on its menu to handle. It needed to create Hydra, Captain America, and also the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I would have preferred that the movie handle only Hydra and Captain America in this movie and choose to have the world-building to be more in the background. The movie instead focuses on the Tesseract which is the important link across these early Marvel Cinematic Universe movies.I would recommend 'Captain America: The First Avenger'.Grade: C",7,0,0,11 January 2020

The movie covers the early parts of Howard Hughes' life from his early childhood to his attempts at getting the Spruce Goose into action. This movie goes in-depth exploring Howard Hughes.The Aviator is an excellent movie. This movie is masterfully directed and edited. Martin Scorcese already had an excellent career in direction prior to this movie and The Aviator solidifies his position. This movie's direction and shots are beautiful. It masterfully displays the different stages of Howard Hughes life and his struggles. Early in the movie, Howard Hughes is displayed to be a skilled businessman, engineer, film director, and philanthropist. This worsens as the movie goes on from the struggles he has. The direction shows the Obsessive Compulsive Disorder that Howard Hughes has and it worms its way into parts of his life. The direction is incredibly well-done in this regard.The main role played by Leonardo Di Caprio is one of the best roles that he has played. This role is absolutely not an easy one. Howard Hughes is portrayed as both a tragic figure and a heroic figure in this movie. The obsessive compulsive disorder that afflicts Howard Hughes is seen early on in his life and gradually he succumbs to the mental disorder. It is heartbreaking to see and it was masterfully played by Leonardo Di Caprio. The audience can take part in his early heroic endeavors and then see as his mental disorder causes him to shrink into a shell of his former self. It was great watching Howard Hughes conquer his disorder in the end and finally own up to his legacy.This movie centers a lot on the obsessive compulsive disorder that Howard Hughes has. Across the 170 minute running time of the movie, the movie focuses on Howard Hughes and has elements of this disorder come into play. Audiences that do not like drama and do not like such character focused movies should look elsewhere. The audiences that do enjoy watching an interesting historical figure should absolutely watch this movie. This movie portrays the obsessive compulsive disorder incredibly well and shows how a mental disorder can cripple a good mind.The supporting cast in this movie is excellent. Every casting choice in this movie is top-notch. Special praise should be given to Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn, Alan Alda as Senator Owen Brewster, and Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner. These supporting characters really made the character of Howard Hughes play out well and it made the entire movie feel complete. Howard Hughes can be seen as a divisive figure and I am glad that the movie does not shy away from this.I highly recommend The Aviator. This movie is an excellent biographical drama. The only criticism I had was it only covered a small portion of Howard Hughes' life. I would have wanted a sequel or a longer movie that covered more.Grade: A",9,0,0,13 July 2019
Justice League," Unoriginal
","This review contains spoilers.Justice League is a continuation of the DC cinematic universe after Batman v Superman and Wonder Woman. This movie features appearances from Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg, Superman, and Steppenwolf.This movie like Batman v Superman has many problems. The re shoots that were needed harmed this movie's pacing. This movie has massive tonal shifts from its darker universe depicted in Batman v Superman to a lighter tone as seen in Marvel movies. Although this tone is welcome, the abrupt changes in this movie's tone is not. It is distracting to the film goer to be experiencing these tone shifts so suddenly. This movie had scenes that were certainly fun to watch for its joyful tone, but they ultimately led nowhere. It did not inform the viewer of character development or backstory the audience does not already know.Steppenwolf as a villain is weak much like the singleshot Marvel movie villains. Steppenwolf did not have any build up from any previous DC cinematic universe movies.In this movie, Steppenwolf simply exists to be the antagonist and conquer the Earth. The way that the villain does this is to assembler three boxes of power and cause a cataclysm. This plot is incredibly generic. Although the movie suggests the ancient factions such as the Amazons and Atlanteans know of him, the movie only uses the scenes to provide action without plot. The movie's resolution to Steppenwolf is not satisfying. After Superman is resurrected, Steppenwolf is simply defeated. This defeated the entire purpose of founding the Justice League. The premise of the movie was to see how the world could be defended if Superman did not exist. The Justice League's decision to resurrect Superman only served to highlight how non-functioning the organization is by having Superman defeating the main villain.Justice League is a movie with a lot of problems. However, the movie has great action scenes and an interesting world. These attributes may be enough for viewers and I would recommend anyone looking for solid action to watch this movie. To others that care about good stories in their movies, Justice League is not recommended.Grade: C",6,0,0,13 June 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," There and back again
","This review contains spoilers.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring premiered in 2001 and is the first part to the The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The movie is based off of the novel by JRR Tolkien of the same name. The movie follows Frodo Baggins, played by Elijah Wood, as he discovers a magic ring belonging to his uncle Bilbo Baggins.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is a classic movie based on a classic book. This movie harkens back to an era of film-making similar to an epic. This movie has everything that composes an epic movie. The movie has a large cast of diverse characters. The movie has a long journey that is started but not completed by the end of the movie. The movie features large sweeping angles courtesy of the director Peter Jackson. This movie makes great use of being the first part of a movie trilogy by setting itself up well.The movie feels well thought out with its pacing. The movie is a lengthy one at 178 minutes for the theatrical cut. The movie uses this time to develop the characters and setting. Any fans of the book will enjoy seeing the writings realized on film. It is impressive seeing The Shire, Rivendell, and Isengard. However this movie is not completely accurate to the book, I would still consider this movie a faithful adaptation.The casting is absolutely perfect. Every actor and actress fits their role so well that it is hard to imagine anyone else playing the role. Sir Ian McKellen is perfect as Gandalf. Viggo Mortensen does a great job as Aragorn. There are no weak casting choices in this movie.The actual plot of this movie is simple and easy to follow. The movie follows Frodo Baggins as the Fellowship of the Ring is formed and dissolved. This is a strength of the movie as this simple plot is still executed well. I have always believed that the Lord of the Rings did well with world building rather than the immediate plot. That is reflected here with how this movie is presented and directed.The extended cut of the Fellowship of the Ring is highly recommended. This extended cut adds so much to the movie that I recommend watching this cut instead of the Theatrical cut.Overall I would highly recommend The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.Grade: A",8,0,0,12 November 2018
The Matrix Revolutions," An unsatisfying conclusion
","This review contains spoilers.The Matrix Revolutions is the third movie in the Matrix franchise and is the sequel to 2003's The Matrix Reloaded. The movie is directed by The Wachowskis, produced by Joel Silver, written by The Wachowskis and stars Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Hugo Weaving. The movie picks up where The Matrix Reloaded leaves off with the sentinel army breaking through to Zion, Neo is stuck in the machine world, and Smith continues growing in power.The Matrix Revolutions is the conclusion to The Matrix trilogy. The Matrix Revolutions has grand spectacles in key scenes. The introduction retrieval of Neo from the Merovingian, the battle for Zion, and the final battle between Neo and Smith are awe-inspiring to watch. The movie plays to its strengths visually and it absolutely shows in its production, shots, and cinematography. This movie is a treat to watch visually and audibly. The movie thrives when it is presenting the situations.The story suffers from the same drawbacks as the The Matrix Reloaded. With only a few months until the movie was released, any of the criticism that was leveled towards The Matrix Reloaded could not be fixed. The movie had to go towards the ending here. The movie still suffers from over bloatedness that plagued the previous movie. This is not helped in this movie as there are many characters that are simply side characters elevated to a higher standing. The audience wants to watch a movie featuring the original characters from The Matrix. Morpheus, Neo, and Trinity should have been the focus and should have been involved in the storylines in The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. The story could have built up the characters better and had a more satisfying resolution.The defense of Zion is pointless knowing the revelation from The Matrix Reloaded. In the movie, the plight of the freed humans is pointless when the revelation is that the machines have predicted them to be wiped out. The machines have also wiped out the humans before. We as the audience know that the fight is futile. The only treat the audience has is that the sequence is pretty to watch with many cool effects on display. Otherwise, there is a lack of tension in the scenes. There are not characters that the audience cares from the start of The Matrix trilogy to the end present in the battle.The movie heavily draws upon the story with Neo. The movie felt conclusive and even interesting as it brought back the themes from the first Matrix movie. The concluding fight between Neo and Smith is both narratively, visually, and audibly satisfying to the audience. The movie has a super-charged Smith fight against the anomaly of Neo. The conclusion of the battle made sense and rewarded the audience that paid close attention across the three Matrix movies. The conclusion itself may not make sense logically with what the characters state but Neo's own story arc was satisfying to watch.I would recommend 'The Matrix Revolutions'.Grade: B",7,1,2,19 October 2019
Split," A welcome back to form
","This review contains spoilers.Split is directed by M. Night Shyamalan and stars James McAvoy and Anya Taylor Joy. The movie follows a group of young girls that are kidnapped by a man with multiple personalities. The man intends to sacrifice them to a rumored new personality named 'The Beast'.Split is a welcome back to form for M. Night Shyamalan. The movie is much better written and directed than his recent movies. The dialogue is not as unintentionally hilarious as Shyamalan's previous movie, The Happening. Each of the characters feels important to the story and the direction of the movie feels unique like The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. Split felt more accessible and unique more so than other Shyamalan flops. Although the movie is funny at times, these felt intentional and added to the character's backstory. I was riveted to watch more of the personalities.James McAvoy is the stand-out actor here. He does a fantastic job as Kevin and all of his personalities. Each of them are distinct and even James McAvoy's body language is spot-on. I felt that all of the personalities acted appropriately. Each personality is portrayed well and both the acting and writing should be praised. The final reveal of 'The Beat' and that the movie is an indirect sequel to Unbreakable was well done. It was appropriate seeing the cameo of Bruce Willis as David Dunn. Anya Taylor-Joy does a good job as a damaged teenager. Her performance is not as overt as James McAvoy's and she does a good job with the role. She is out-shined by James McAvoy.Overall, I would recommend Split. It is a tense movie with Shyamalan finally doing a good job.Grade: B",7,1,3,28 May 2018
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Formulaic
","This review contains spoilers.'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' is the sequel to Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The movie is directed by Jonathan Mostow. The story is written John Brancato, Michael Ferris, and Tedi Sarafian. The movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes, and Kristanna Loken. The movie takes place many years after the end of Terminator 2: Judgment Day. John Connor, played by Nick Stahl, is living off the grid. Skynet re-emerges through a new model called the T-X to assassinate John Connor's lieutenants. The threat of another Judgment Day becomes inevitable as the threat of Skynet still looms.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is an unnecessary sequel. The movie simply did not need to be made after the conclusion of Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The second Terminator movie had ended the franchise in a satisfying way. The sequel is still serviceable. The movie is well-directed for the most part. There are fun and exciting action scenes in this movie. The truck chase scene is one of the highlights in this movie. The cast overall do a good job. The movie is still serviceable and the movie as a whole suffers from lack of a reason to exist.The villain in this movie is the T-X. The new terminator is a hybrid between the T-800 and the T-1000. The new terminator assumes a female appearance. The terminator is set up well throughout the movie. The T-X is able to maintain an intimidating presence, but it is not nearly as strong as the T-1000 in the previous movie. There are interesting aspects that the T-X has such as advanced weaponry that it possesses from the future. The movie makes this abundantly clear and focuses on it. However, the alien-like quality of the T-1000 is missing here and that ultimately causes the villain to suffer.The movie does not have John Connor as the solo protagonist. Katherine Brewster, played by Claire Danes, and the T-850, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, also share the role of the protagonist. The movie commonly moves between these characters and the lack of true focus on John Connor can be distracting. The movie should have been more about John Connor, but he does not embark on a memorable character arc in this movie. John Connor has the arc of being the savior of humanity. It was not satisfying to see it as there was nothing special to see about it. John Connor simply accepts his fate and becomes the savior. Katherine Brewster on the other hand goes from a vulnerable woman to someone that takes a stand against the machines. This arc was slightly more satisfying but it suffered from lack of focus. The entire story did not work well. The T-850 is a centerpiece and the character development of the T-800 from Terminator 2: Judgment Day is copied over to this movie. It did not make any sense for this T-850 unit to behave the same exact way as the T-800 from Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Even knowing that Katherine Brewster had sent the T-850 unit back, it felt like there was no reason for its behavior to be the same as the previous movie.Jonathan Mostow does an admirable job trying to create a Terminator sequel. However, the sequel does not have the same impact as the second movie did versus the first. I would still recommend the movie despite this flaw.Grade: C",6,1,2,29 June 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," A wild and well animated tale
","This review contains spoilers.Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse is directed by Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, and Rodney Rothman. The animated movie premiered in 2008 and is written by Phil Lord. The movie stars Shameik Moore and Jake Johnson as the main voice cast. The movie is about a multiverse incident that Miles Morales becomes drawn into. He attempts to resolve the problem with the multiverse caused by Kingpin.Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse is a solid movie. Across the board, the movie has a solid plot, solid visuals, and solid voice performances. There are many events in this movie that could be executed poorly, but the movie's direction and voice performances elevate it. The movie boasts many solid visuals from its incredibly distinctive design.The visuals of this movie are easily the most distinctive and strongest part of the movie. The movie's visuals are not completely smooth at first, but with time the audience gets used to it. The visuals then flourish as the 117 minutes of running time go on. The visual only got better and more colorful as time went on. The ending sequence in the supercollider is exceptional as I do not think the scene could have worked as well live-action. The ending scene is both a treat to watch visually and experience emotionally.The story is unique for a spider-man movie. The movie utilizes the multiverse and brings in multiple spider-man and spider-woman into the story. The new characters are introduced in a comic book style that fits the overall visual style of the film. These introductions are also funny as each of the spider-men come s from different backgrounds. This is something
that the movie does well as all of the different spider-men felt different. The movie utilized its humor incredibly well as many of the situations that Miles found himself in had humor to lighten the mood.Miles Morales is a great spider-man. His entire story does not deviate from other spider-man stories much, but it is delivered in a way that feels fresh. This story is familiar, but the characters in the story are different from how we know them. It is this trait that makes the movie unique from other cinematic spider-man movies.I would recommend Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse. This is a solid animated Spider-man movie for all ages to enjoy.Grade: B",8,1,4,20 January 2019

Terminator 2: Judgment Day premiered in 1991 and is directed, and produced by James Cameron. The movie is written by James Cameron, and William Wisher. The movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick, and Edward Furlong. The movie follows a few years after the events of The Terminator. John Connor, played by Edward Furlong, is a child under a foster home and Sarah Connor is interred in a mental health hospital. A new terminator is sent to assassinate John Connor.Terminator 2: Judgment Day is an excellent sequel to The Terminator. This movie takes the action that audiences enjoyed in the first movie and elevates it to a new height. It successfully creates the same feelings as the first movie with the awe of action created by cyborgs. This movie is not only a great sequel but a masterful entry in action movies. Terminator 2: Judgment Day has excellent chase and action set pieces. This movie spawned endless copies that could only hope to emulate the incredibly well-done action scenes in this movie. Most of the action scenes in this movie are composed of chases when the T-1000 acquires John Connor. The movie varies this by coming up with various reasons for the chase to occur. These reasons make perfect sense in the movie.The writing in this movie is different from the first movie. The movie prioritizes action scenes more so than the first movie. This is not a problem as Terminator 2: Judgment Day still has the heart and brain of the original. The movie successfully blends action and the thoughtfulness of the first movie that held the original's appeal past the action. The movie utilizes its characters in Sarah Connor, John Connor, and the T-800 well. These characters are developed incredibly well from the first movie. Sarah Connor still maintains her character development from the first movie. In the sequel, she is more determined to prevent the apocalyptic future. She has a nice character arc in trying to recover her humanity. John Connor has a good character arc in becoming the future leader of humanity he was meant to be. The T-800 even has a good character arc in the machine attempting to understand humanity.The villain of the T-1000 is both intimidating and unique. This villain has plans to trap the heroes and every scene that he was in he had a great presence. The T-1000 easily made the movie special and created a great dynamic with the characters unable to destroy the villain until the end.The direction by James Cameron is masterful. I found all the scenes beautiful and interesting in some way. The movie creates many great scenes and the action scenes above all have such great care and attention to it. All of the scenes in this movie are masterfully done and creates the high level of quality the audience will appreciate. The movie benefits greatly from the added budget from the first movie.I highly recommend 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day.'Grade: A",9,0,0,29 June 2019
The Patriot," A silly historically inaccurate movie
","This review contains spoilersThe Patriot is a historical war movie that premiered in 2000. The movie is directed Roland Emmerich and written by Robert Rodat. The movie is set during the American Revolution in 1776. The movie follows Benjamin Martin, played by Mel Gibson. The movie is from the American point of view as the American revolution erupts.The Patriot absolutely fails as a historical film. This movie is rife with historical inaccuracies. These historical inaccuracies continue to pile on and it comes to a time that shows the movie as an incompetent mess when it comes to historical research. One of the mistakes is that the movie frequently demonizes the British antagonists. The movie culminates in a scene where a church full of American residents are burned by the British. This scene should never have happened. If such an event had happened in history, this event would have been a massive rallying cry for colonials. The movie also paints the French as less helpful than they really were. The French help is simply glossed over until the end of the movie. The movie does these things to glorify the colonials and the United States of America instead of being truer to history.History aside, the movie can be entertaining to watch. The action scenes feel authentic. The effects are good for its time and they still hold up today. These work to the movie's benefit as the scenes are fun to watch. The audience must turn their brain off to enjoy the movie. The British are portrayed as cruel and sadistic soldiers that it ultimately becomes laughable. The United States are portrayed as noble heroes and are ultimately shown to prevail despite all odds.The movie does present its war scenes well. The movie feels epic as it shows various battles. for American independence. I wish the movie focused more on these specific battles or even only a subset of the battles rather than all of the war for independence. It would have been more fulfilling to watch a more researched movie than something that only scratches the surface of the entire war. This is however the reason why the movie is meant to be so casual. It is a mainstream Hollywood movie that simply uses its tropes to drive the narrative. Luckily the movie is not boring, but it could have been so much more than what the audience sees here.The Patriot is not recommended. This movie feels like it could have been so much more. It also presents itself as a historical movie but has so many inaccuracies.Grade: D",6,2,6,25 December 2018

The movie follows a journalist and an investigator as they look into a series of old murders.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a good movie. This movie has great pacing and introduction of its characters. The move has Mikael Blomkvist being more focused on the main story arc while Lisbeth Salander has a longer introduction. Mikael Blomkvist has more of a conventional introduction. The more interesting introduction is in Lisbeth Salander. The introduction of Lisbeth Salander does not have much to do with the main story but it is an interesting beginning of the movie. It absolutely sets up the movie's tone well and it sets up the character of Lisbeth Salander well.The lead actors of Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomkvist, and Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander do an excellent job in their roles. These two actors bring a great energy to the role. Rooney Mara sticks out from the cast. She does incredibly well portraying Lisbeth across the intense emotional range that Lisbeth goes through this movie. Lisbeth Salander is the best component of this movie.The writing of this movie is the real focus. The characters are great, and the plot is fun to watch. It is incredibly tense with all of the setting and world helping with that feeling. Even the mystery is engrossing to both the audience and lead characters. Even the villains are written well with the dialogue between the main characters and villains being a highlight.The movie is incredibly well directed by David Fincher. This direction is taut and improves the tension that the books does well. The quieter moments in the movie are also well directed by showing important facts to the audience. There is so much in each scene that has more than the audience may notice at first. The movie reflects this incredibly well while also allowing the audience to only care about the immediate plot.I highly recommend The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. This movie is a great adaptation of the books.Grade: A",9,0,0,15 December 2018

The movie stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Peter Sarsgaard, Chris Cooper, Lucas Black, and Jamie Foxx. The movie is about a group of United States Marine Corp recruits that go through training and then are deployed to the Gulf War.Jarhead is an incredibly authentic movie. This movie has an authentic portrayal of life in the United States Marine Corp. The movie makes the United States Marine Corp out to be an independent and storied institution. The recruits are what is expected from how the military recruits young adults. There really is not anything held back in the portrayal of the United States Marine Corp. The audience does see the insanity that is caused by shipping abroad and the sheer boredom the soldiers on the ground will endure.The movie's greatest attribute is its cinematography and visuals. This is a stunningly gorgeous movie that recreates the Gulf War. The attention to detail and visuals produced by the creators of the movie should be commended. The Highway of Death and other classic Gulf War iconography is shown in this movie in gruesome detail. It made for the movie being incredibly authentic. The audience does feel like a person that is on the ground with the soldiers in the Gulf War.Jake Gyllenhaal does an amazing job as Anthony Swofford. He is able to portray the gruff sniper that only wants a kill in his squad. The audience experiences the sheer boredom that entails being a Marine sniper. This performance is among one of the best by Jake Gyllenhaal.I would recommend 'Jarhead'.Grade: B",7,1,1,7 September 2019
Dunkirk," Historical spectacle
","This review contains spoilers.Dunkirk is directed by Christopher Nolan and is a movie about the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Forces in World War 2. The movie is told from three perspectives: land, sea, and air as all perspectives are followed according to their time length. The land perspective takes place over the span of a week as an infantryman tries to survive. The sea perspective is over the span of one day as a captain of a little boat is aiding the evacuation. The air perspective is a Spitfire pilot in dogfights to protect the sea transports and takes place over the span of one hour.Dunkirk is a visually impressive movie. There is very little computer generated imagery on the screen and the movie benefits from this. The movie has a grounded in reality feel and this increases the tension. It was a great experience to watch this in the theater. Although there are some historical inaccuracies such as the German planes being painted incorrectly, this did not detract from the experience. The movie felt authentic and all the scenes had an authentic feel. Even the sound design felt correct and contributed to the movie. Plane propeller sounds, radio crackles, and ship sirens helped in immersing the viewer. The sound design deserves a lot of praise and it consistently delivers. All of the sound contributes to the emotions of the movie.The story of this movie is bare-bones. However, the characters and setting make up for the story. The movie is very much a viewing into the battle and evacuation at Dunkirk. The story is also told in a non-conventional way with different perspectives at different times. This movie may be hard to follow with its constant cuts, but this has a purpose with its desire to tell the three perspectives in different time frames. Viewers of Christopher Nolan's previous movies will understand how the director uses the theme of time. The scenes are similar to Memento and Inception.The actors do a good job here. Tom Hardy deserves special praise for being able to portray his character's strugger with minimal dialogue and his eyes. The other actors also do a good job and there is minimal dialogue in general for this movie.Overall Dunkirk is recommended. The movie tells the story of the Dunkirk evacuation in a unique way. The sound and visual experience should be had in the largest screen as possible.Grade: B",8,1,3,10 June 2018

The movie is a defining moment in Sigourney Weaver's career and it defined her as a strong female character in the movies. The movie uses Sigourney Weaver to good effect. Ripley is a great character in this movie. The story arc of her investigating the xenomorphs is used to great effect and she is brought in as a consultant to help the a colony that has gone dark.The story to Aliens is basic. Ripley is brought into help the colonial marines investigate a disappearance of the colony. Along the way the colonial marines and Ripley have to fight for survival to deal with the threat of the xenomorphs. There are more facts learned about the xenomorphs such as their hive structure but the xenomorph from the first game is present in abundance. The characters in this movie actively fight back against the xenomorphs and can destroy them. The xenomorph being classified as the ultimate being in the first movie is not true seeing how they struggle against the marines when they are aware of the aliens.The movie is incredibly well produced. There production qualities of this movie is of the highest degree. The movie's universe feels like a lived-in future. There is not any ridiculous technologies present in this movie. Aliens continues the same worn-down technology from the first movie. The technology present in the movie is not a sterilized future. Instead each of the items feels like a run-down technology that could exist in the future.All of the side characters in Aliens have a great roles and dialogue. Each of them feels like a distinct character even when they embody some of the same traits. Each of the colonial marines have their own characteristics. They serve as characters that play a part in the story and characters that the audience can enjoy.Aliens is incredibly influential and served to influence science fiction movies in the next few decades. I highly recommend Aliens.Grade: A",9,0,0,29 February 2020
Quantum of Solace," Muddled and shaky
","This review contains spoilers.Quantum of Solace is an action spy moyle that premiered in 2008. The movie is directed by Marc Foster and is based on James Bond by Ian Fleming. The movie's story is written by Paul Haggis, Neal Purvis, and Robert Wade. The movie has Daniel Craig reprise the role of James Bond and stars Olga Kurylenko. The movie continues where Casino Royale left off and has James Bond trying to thwart a plot to stop the Quantum organization.Quantum of Solace is an incredibly muddled movie. There are not many redeeming qualities about this movie. The movie meanders from plot point and can not keep a focused story. The movie starts off well with James Bond escaping with Mr White. The car chase is riveting to watch but then the plot becomes horribly convoluted. Plot points simply come and go but does not coalesce into a thorough line of thought.Events and characters feel contrived. The action scenes are not good. The scenes frequently utilize quick cuts that do not help immerse the audience. These quick cuts only served to take me out of the experience. Outside of the opening chase scene, I am hard pressed to remember any interesting action scenes. Everything felt similar and not distinct.Both Daniel Craig, and Olga Kurylenko, do not do a phenomenal job in the more. The performance is bland and it feels like the script is incredibly limiting on the lead actors. There is simply not much they do both drama and stunt wise.Overall, Quantum of Solace is a mess. This movie has little redeeming qualities making it not recommended by me.Grade: D",5,4,4,3 March 2019
District 9," A sharp science-fiction action movie
","This review contains spoilers.District 9 is a science-fiction action movie that premiered in 2009. The movie is directed by Neill Blomkamp and is written by Neill Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell. The movie stars Sharlto Copley in the leading role. The movie is about an extraterrestrial spaceship that arrives outside Johannesburg. The movie focuses on Wikus van de Merwe played by Sharlto Copley that discovers something in the alien slums.District 9 is a nice surprise. This movie presents science-fiction in an approachable way for mainstream audiences. There is also subtext in the imovie that can help audience's enjoyment of the movie. The movie's plot and direction move at a quick pace while also introducing important plot elements in the movie. All of this together makes for an enjoyable experience for the audience.The main plot does focus on the lead of Wikus van de Merwe and Christopher Johnson, played by Jason Cope. This focus happens for the entire movie and is enjoyable to watch. Wikus goes through a drastic transformation across the 112 minute running time of this movie. It was great to see his humanization as the movie went on and he became more alien. Likewise Christopher started to care more about Wikus as time went on and the two can be seen coming to a respect for one another. The two are begrudgingly together and trying to solve their predicaments selfishly until they realized they needed to help each other. From the beginning until the end the movie's plot had me engrossed.Another great part of this movie is the action. As a rarity in the science-fiction genre, the movie has many action scenes. This movie is gory, and visceral in the action scenes. The aliens have advanced weaponry that is authentically presented in the movie. I enjoyed this aspect of the movie as the weaponry is utterly remorseless in its depiction. This doubly goes for the brutality shown by aliens and humans. In addition to being cool to look at, the action drives the themes of the movie which is a great component in this movie. The brutality opens up the drama that is at the core of this movie.District 9 does a good job balancing action, comedy, and drama. The movie balances all of these things even as the audience learns more about the world of District 9. Much of the movie
relies on the direction and acting. Both of these components are at a high standard and it makes the shocking parts of the movile more memorable. Sharlto Copley is in a panic mode for much of the movie and he balances this with his character's concerns well. He has a good balance between to self-preservation and helping the alien prawns. Likewise Christopher is mainly a voice in this movie and it really shows in his emotions. The two share a memorable emotional moment near the end of the movie.
I highly recommend 'District 9'. This movie had a surprising amount of drama for a science fiction movie. It is absolutely a great movie in 2009.Grade: A",9,0,0,26 January 2019
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," A bogged middle
","This review contains spoilers.The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is the sequel to The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. The movie is the second part to The Hobbit trilogy. The movie continues following the same characters as they continue making their way to the mountain home of the Dwarves. Along the way they are hounded by obstacles and Azog.The second installment to The Hobbit trilogy is truly a bloated mess. The first movie, An Unexpected Journey, at a least had more focus than the second movie. This second movie had many elements of it that had no bearing on the rest of the movie. For one, when the Dwarves go into Mirkwood they are captured. This is a fun side adventure by itself, but it creates a pointless love story-line. In this story-line Tauriel a Wood-elf played by Evangeline Lilly falls in love with the Dwarf Kili and vice versa. The movie continues to explore this story-line even though it felt like needless time padding.The movie has loads of new movie only characters that never existed in the book. This adds so much more padding to an already overloaded movie that there really does not have to be. The series really should have ended with this movie and the previous one being three hours each. This movie meanders for a long time focusing on character that it really should not be. A lot of characters from The Lord of the Rings trilogy return here and it only serves the purpose of setting up The Lord of the Rings. This is a bad way of setting up the Lord of the Rings trilogy as it was done at the expense of The Hobbit trilogy. As a retrospective, The Hobbit could have done better with the Lord of the Rings foreshadowing in the background rather than the foreground.This movie is of course incredibly stunning visually. The effects are great at a standard frames per second and the 48 frames per second. The movie's barrel sequence and dragon sequence are the most memorable. Both of these scenes have interesting visual choices and direction that makes them fun to watch. There is nothing I did not like about these two scenes. The audience had a blast watching them.The casting choices in this movie are great. Just as in The Lord of the Rings, I could not see any weak links in the cast. Each actor and actress fit their role. Even Benedict Cumberbatch that voiced Smaug fit the role perfectly. Listening to Bilbo, played by Martin Freeman, and Smang banter is entertaining to listen to.I would still recommend The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. The viewers should check their expectations and not expect the same quality as The Lord of the Rings Trilogy.Grade: C",7,0,0,17 November 2018
Batman Begins," Superhero origins
","This review contains spoilers.Batman Begins is directed by Christopher Nolan and stars Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne. Batman Begins is about Batman's origin story where he begins his journey as a superhero vigilante. Bruce Wayne learns from the League of Shadows and later thwarts a plot to destroy Gotham.The movie is a great high budget entertainment flick. From the beginning of the movie, the audience can follow Bruce Wayne's story. He is self-exiled and trains under the League of Shadows. Bruce keeps his moral code and refuses to kill which leads to an impressive scene of his escape. The movie continues its good use of cinematography and directing. Christopher Nolan does a good job with the set pieces here. There is never a technically incompetent done shot or edit. The actors all do a good job with their lines with the obvious stand-out being Christian Bale. Christian Bale does a great job in the role and he could be the best portrayal of Batman in cinema.The soundtrack and sound design all present each scene appropriately. The audience can feel the intensity in the scene and the beats. Hans Zimmer does a great job in collaborating with Christopher Nolan to deliver an audio and visual experience.There are some flaws with the movie which lie in its flow and writing. Some scenes could have been lead up to better. These scenes spontaneously introduce the action. Likewise the dialogue especially with Scarecrow could have been written better.These are minor issues and Batman Begins is a recommended movie for all audiences.Grade: B",8,0,0,23 May 2018
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," An wonderful expectation
","This review contains spoilers.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first movie in the Hobbit movie series. The movie is a prequel to the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy. The story follows Bilbo Baggins, played by Martin Freeman, who becomes involved in an adventure. A group of Dwarves organized by Gandalf the Grey stay at Bilbo's home and bring him into a quest to reclaim their Dwarven home.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a different movie and series from The Lord of the Rings. This movie is for one a movie with a wider scope and different intended audience. The movie is based on the book of the same name by JRR Tolkien. The book is wrtten for a younger audience and that is reflected in the screenplay. The characters are more light hearted and there are no large scale battles. The movie focuses on the character dynamic between Gandalf, Bilbo, and the Dwarves. These interactions are where the movie does best because they are new and unfamiliar to the audience. The discussions the characters have are memorable.The movie features 48 frames per second that was shown in select theaters. This feature should be avoided by most audiences. Some of my audience members could not handle the frame rate and had to stop watching. For the audience members that could bear with it, the experience can be positive. The 48 frames per second can contribute to that feeling of the fantastical. The movie's effects look much slicker in this frame rate. This technological feature of the movie does not however make up for its shortcomings.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey has many plot deficiencies. Most of it comes from the movie being too bloated. The decision to split the adaptation of the book into multiple parts allows the audience to see more of Middle Earth. However, this costs the movie in pacing. This is a slow movie. Even by the Lord of the Rings extended cut standards, the theatrical cut at The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey has lots of superfluous scenes. There is an entire subplot with the necromancer that is explored and it ultimately leads to something the audiences know from watching The Lord of the Rings.Even if the movie's pacing is slowed due to the bloat, the rest of the movie is of high quality. Peter Jackson does a fine job with Middle Earth. Visiting this world is recommended.Grade: B",7,0,0,17 November 2018
The Princess Bride," An impressive grand story
","This review contains spoilers.'The Princess Bride' is a romantic comedy adventure movie that premiered in 1987. The movie is directed by Rob Reiner. The screenplay is by William Goldman who also wrote the novel 'The Princess Bride.' The movie is about a plot of a novel being read by a grandfather.The Princess Bride is a great movie. This movie has a quick pace that keeps the story going and engaging. The Princess Bride engages lots of fantasy tropes to great effect. This helped the audience's enjoyment of everything on the screen as it was always meant to be enjoyable as a fairytale. This story has thrills and light-hearted humor. It made for an engaging and fun story.Peter Falk as the grandpa provides much of the narration in the movie. This narration is actually welcome as it feels incredibly fitting. The narration also set the tone incredibly well and it made the movie much more enjoyable. All of the actors and actresses do a great job in this movie. The main story is headed by Cary Elwes as Westley. The story is aided by the performances of Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, and Mandy Patinkin. This movie contains silly moments that the actors play straight. This makes for an enjoyable experience.I would recommend 'The Princess Bride.'Grade: B",8,3,4,11 May 2019
Saving Private Ryan," Defining War Film
","This review contains spoilers.Saving Private Ryan is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks plays a ranger captain that leads a squad into enemy territory to rescue a paratrooper whose brothers were killed in action. Saving Private Ryan opens with an aged Ryan that visits a memorial. The story then transitions to the D-Day landings that sets up the arc of the story. Ryan's brothers had all died in the various U.S. Army campaigns in World War 2. The higher ups in the United States army assign a squad to rescue the last sibling, Ryan. The squad embarks into France and behind enemy lines, encountering French civilians, paratroopers, and enemy patrols. Finally the squad reaches Ryan's location and does a last stand.Saving Private Ryan is a visceral look at World War 2 from the perspective of the United States Army. From the beginning of the movie, the images and sounds pull no punches at portraying the grittiness of war. Saving Private Ryan earns its R rating with the level of gore in the film. Events in the movie are also written well with everything flowing organically. The directing is good at portraying the action scenes, but the drama scenes being great elevate this movie. What separates this movie from others in its genre is its more personal look and portrayal of war. I saw the main theme of sacrifice being used by the movie with the characters commenting and even lamenting their fallen comrades. Is the mission or your country worth sacrificing yourself for?Saving Private Ryan does have some inadequacies. History fans will notice a lot of inaccuracies which will annoy them. Some scenes seem superfluous and not entirely necessary.Overall, Saving Private Ryan is a solid movie and helped define a generation of war movies set in World War 2. I would recommend Saving Private Ryan.Grade: B",8,2,3,3 March 2018
Lawrence of Arabia," A grand and exciting adventure
","This review contains spoilers.'Lawrence of Arabia' is a 1962 epic historical film. The movie is directed by David Lean with the screenplay by Robert Bolt, and Michael Wilson. The movie stars Peter O'Toole, Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Jack Hawkins, and Omar Sharif. The movie follows the life of T. E. Lawrence. The conflict that T. E. Lawrence experiences during his support of the Arab uprising against the Ottoman Empire is in full view across this 180 minute epic.The movie centers around T. E. Lawrence. This movie follows T. E. Lawrence from his beginnings as a British lieutenant in The Great War. He embarks on a journey to the Arab world to aid in the uprising against the Ottoman Empire. The movie covers his entire journey in the Arab world from his beginnings to the completion of the rebellion. The movie utilizes the long time the movie has with the audience incredibly well. The movie absolutely benefits from the 180+ minutes of running time to establish characters that T. E. Lawrence interacts with characters such as Prince Faisal that are strong characters in their own way.There are two parts to the movie that should be mentioned. The first part of the movie details the rise of T. E. Lawrence in the Arab world and his assistance with the revolt. The second part of the movie details the winding down of the revolt and the eventual end of the war. Both of the parts have their own themes and it is nice to see the distinction between the two parts. The second part in particular has T. E. Lawrence become a new character as the result of his torture by the Ottomans. There is a brutal satisfaction that the audience sees in the conclusion of the movie.This movie is incredibly beautiful. The sets, and shots are incredibly well done. The audience can feel that they are in the desert looking at the authenticity that the movie brings. This movie has incredibly high production values and it holds up even today. Although the movie does not have modern filmmaking techniques, this was not a hindrance to the movie at all. The movie has its own epic feeling that modern movies cannot replicate.I highly recommend 'Lawrence of Arabia'.Grade: A",9,1,2,6 July 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Ambitious cross over
","This review contains spoilers.Avengers: Infinity War is the third movie in the Avengers series and is the culmination of the infinity stone arc that has been hinted at in the previous Marvel cinematic universe movies. This movie explores Thanos in more depth as well as utilizing all characters in the Marvel cinematic universe to resist Thanos' plan. The movie is about the event of the infinity stones being brought together and the heroic response.Avengers: Infinity War is a visually impressive movie. The movie is filled with dazzling special effects in every scene. The sound is likewise at the high quality as the visuals. There is not a weak part of the audio and visual experience. The movie felt like how the Marvel cinematic universe should feel after all of the movies. Thanos' character design resembles his comic counterpart and he looks as realistic within reason as a giant humanoid alien should look. Likewise, Thanos' children have distinct and great designed that allow the audience to pick them out in a wide frame.The problems with this movie lie in its story and approach-ability. This entry in the Avengers film series is the least accessible out of all of the Avengers movies. The audience must watch the previous Marvel movies or they will be lost. There is not a single main character or group that is followed in this movie. The only character that is followed consistently with an arc is Thanos. He could be considered the villain protagonist of the story, but he is still not followed as in a classic movie. The movie starts with the cross-overs and anybody that is not familiar with Marvel characters will be lost. Each of the characters maintain their traits in this movie. The guardians of the galaxy have their character when interacting with Thor, Iron Man, Spider-man, and Doctor Strange. The flip-side is also true where the Earth's heroes maintain their personality through the dialogue. The writers should be commended for the writing these cross-overs well. The movie splits the plot into separate threads where the heroes try different methods to defeat Thanos. Ultimately none of it matters because Doctor Strange already knows the only way to win. It was predictable that Thanos would get all of the infinity stones. What was not predictable was seeing which heroes would fade away when Thanos removes half of the universe's population. The movie's end was unique where the movie is not afraid to shock the audience with such a downer ending.Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is recommended. The movie is highly ambitious and is an interesting movie to watch for its universe. The movie does have some problems and it is highly recommended to watch previous movies before watching this movie.Grade: B",8,1,2,29 May 2018
Get Out," An interesting horror comedy
","This review contains spoilers.Get Out is directed and written by Jordan Peele and is about an African American man in a mixed race relationship visiting her parents. The Armitage family is involved with missing people in the area. The family has some African American servants that act strangely. Over the course of the movie, this mystery is revealed.The movie's story is its focus and strength. The story is well written. As the movie goes on, audiences can laugh at the strange behavior of the characters but deep down, it is horrifying to see others as objects. The story has a lot of double meaning to it. For example, the Armitage family claiming they are not racists. Racism rakes several forms and Get Out shows that the liberal praising of a race can be discriminatory in the way that Get Out shows. In addition to the story, the movie is well acted and directed. Jordan Peele blended the comedy and horror into the movie well and I enjoyed every moment of the movie.There are some story inconsistencies. It is strange that Rose could have gotten away with entrapping so many people when she is doing it publicly. The victims do not seem to retain their memories and any friends could see something is wrong. These could be excused as the story has explanations for these inconsistencies.Overall, I would recommend Get Out. The movie is a tight horror-comedy that does not rely on jump scares.Grade: B",7,1,2,29 May 2018

The movie is about a princess and her younger sister as they try to stop a magical icestorm.Frozen is in many ways a simple movie. This movie is a simple tale about two sisters that love each other and believe it can overcome conflict. All of the other plots the movie has besides this is superfluous. The main plot that the two sisters Elsa, voiced by Idina Menzel, and Anna, voiced by Kristen Bell, are the main focus here. They also deliver good performances in the vocal portions of the movie.For a family animation, Frozen is more of a child focused movie. There are as pects that adults will, like, in this movie, but much of it is aimed at children. There are not many adult themes in this movie. The movie has many cute characters like Olaf, voiced by Josh Gad. These characters offer little in the way of the plot but offer fun comic relief.In some ways, Frozen can be considered as a deviation from standard Disney animations. There are love sub-plots but it is deviating from the other Disney animations. The romance plots are not the focus here. Elsa and Anna's relations are the focus instead. There are romance subplots but these are more in the background.I would recommend Frozen. The movie is a solid family animation.Grade: B",7,0,2,2 December 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," An exciting middle chapter
","This review contains spoilers.The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is the sequel to the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. The movie picks up where The Fellowship of the Ring had left off. Frodo and Samwise have split off from the fellowship after Boromir's attempt to retrieve the one ring. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli travel to the land of the Rohirrim to save Merry and Pippin.The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers has the dubious honor of being the middle chapter of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The Two Towers handles this well with having satisfying stories and building the trilogy towards the last and final movie. There are many plot threads in this move that matter.The Two Towers focuses on the three groups that comprise the Fellowship of the Ring. Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee continue to bear the ring towards Mount Doom. Merry and Pippin are captured by the Uruk-hai to be brought before Saruman. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli seek to rescue the pair of hobbits captured by Isengard.The story with Frodo Baggins and Samwise have the pair traversing the to Mount Doom through both areas controlled by men and monsters. The pair of hobbits encounter Gollum and enlist his aid in guiding them to Mount Doom. This trip takes the trio into beautiful locations and also serves an important purpose in Frodo learning more about the realms of men and Gollum. I enjoyed this plot a lot and seeing both Frodo and Sam persevere is motivating to watch. The encounter with Faramir is also well done.The story with Merry and Pippin is not the strongest in this movie. Merry and Pippin contribute a fun side plot but do not really undergo an arc like Frodo and Samwise. The pair are simply freed and convince the ents to help defeat Isengard. This arc is visually exciting to watch but is not that exciting narratively.The story line with Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas do not undergo and character changes. This story-line is the most visually impressive. The trio find a resurrected Gandalf and also help the Kingdom of Rohan. The trio meet King Theoden and worm tongue. These characters are fun to watch. The story-line focuses on the conflict between Rohan and Isengard. This story climaxes at Helm's Deep where an epic battle occurs.The battle at Helm's Deep is incredibly cool. This battle is a mini-movie with the way it progresses and develops. The attack by the Uruk-hai is both awe-inspiring and suspenseful to watch. This battle is so fun to watch that it is worth the price of admission alone. I highly recommend watching the extended cut of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. The extended cut adds more interesting details to the movie.I highly recommend watching The Lords of the Rings: The Two Towers.Grade: A",9,0,0,17 November 2018

The movie is about a superhero family that must hide their identities after public opinion turns against the superheroes.The Incredibles is a great movie that showcases how well character and story can be blended in an animation. There are many things that this movie does well and it blends incredibly well. The movie blends its story, action, and character development all in one great package. The movie mainly follows Bob Parr aliasing as Mr. Incredible played by Craig T. Nelson. This character is the central focus from the audience. He is a great character for the audience to follow and we see how he wants to make superheroes more popular again.The visuals in this movie are incredible. They make for an awesome experience if the audience is only watching the movie for the visuals alone. The family's superpowers are in great display here and it is well directed and produced. The production quality is top-notch in this movie and it is true of Pixar movies in general.The movie is incredibly enjoyable. The only downsides to the movie is that for fans of superheroes, there is not much new in this story. The movie features the cliches of the superhero genre. The movie almost plays it straight with how superheroes have to deal with society. The movie does not offer any deconstruction and offers a simple story to the movie. This is fine for any audience that does not want anything difficult to follow.I would recommend 'The Incredibles'.Grade: A",8,0,0,24 December 2019

Nameless claims to have dispatched the assassins that have made an attempt on the King of Qin's life. The King allows Nameless to present his case in person to him.Hero is a beautiful movie that has a great story. Most of the movie is presented as flashbacks and renditions of Nameless' story. This plays into why the movie looks so pretty as much of the movie exists in an idealized form that exists in the character's heads. The cinematography is astounding for his fantastic work. Almost every scene is beautiful to look at with color playing a role in every scene.The story is also riveting. Although it can be hard to follow with much of it being subjective due to memory, the movie makes the main plot of the assassins easy enough to follow.The action in this movie set the bar for the time it was released.

1917," A one-shot epic
","This review contains spoilers.1917 is a war movie that was directed by Sam Mendes. The movie is written by Sam Mendes, and Krysty Wilson-Cairns. The movie stars George MacKay, and Dean-Charles Chapman as two lance corporals in the British army that are sent to deliver a message across enemy lines.1917 is an incredibly simple story. The story follows two lance corporals that are assigned a mission to deliver a message across enemy lines. The movie immediately begins with the two lance corporals as they awaken to the mission. Lance Corporal Blake has a brother in the second Devonshire battalion that is going over the top in the morning and assaulting the enemy lines. The two lance corporals race against time to deliver the message and prevent the attack from taking place. The story is not the main focus here as the story is incredibly basic without many twists and turns. The story is appropriate to the movie as the audience does feel the panic of the main characters as they are trying to overcome the time crunch.The casting of this movie is excellent. Both George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman do a great job in their roles as the messengers. George MacKay deserves praise for carrying a stoic performance as he is plucked for a hellish mission. The movie uses George MacKay astoundingly as he has to navigate through enemy territory in a race against time to save the second Devonshire battalion. Dean-Charles Chapman did a good job for much of the movie until his character's death. The death scene is incredibly haunting as Schofield, played by George MacKay, has to deal with the death of his friend and uncertainty around his chances of succeeding in the mission.The music and cinematography of this movie is bewildering. The music and cinematography work together in such a way as to create an invested experience for the audience. The use of a one-shot directing style did not feel like a gimmick. The one-shot style added to the experience as the directing showed the realities of trench warfare that Lance Corporal Schofield and Lance Corporal Blake had to endure. The audience also followed the journey of these two as they had to cross into enemy territory at risk of danger from the environment and German soldiers. The one-shot style is done in a way that will dazzle the eyes and senses. Of note is the scene in the ruins at night where Schofield has to run through the ruins in order to reach the second Devonshire battalion. This scene is impressive in the execution as flares were constantly fired into the air to reveal any presence in the ruins. This along with the soundtrack created a foreboding sense of tension that at any moment Schofield could have been hit by a bullet.I highly recommend '1917'. This is one of the best war movies and one of the best movies in the 2010-2019 decade.Grade: A",9,1,3,2 May 2020

It is the story of a woman named Betty as she helps an amnesiac woman reclaim her identity. In between this main arc are characters dealing with their own problems. After three-fourths of the movie, the plot focuses on a different set of main characters as the circumstances change.Mulholland Drive blurs the line with what the audience expects out of a neo-noir movie. It becomes difficult to follow with images and arcs that appear impossible. One of these is the transition that no longer focuses on Betty and the amnesiac woman. They become different characters. The other supporting characters seemingly remain the same. Audiences have to pay attention in order to understand the story.The overall style of the movie aimed at making the audience feel uncomfortable. The first three-fourths of the movie has Betty easily achieving her goals. In the last fourth of the movie, Naomi Watts' character suffers constantly .It is almost her personal hell she is living as she barely gets through the day. The sub plots of a hitman are humorous and seemingly do not make much sense until the end.The directing of this movie is great. David Lynch's style is perfect for a movie such as this. There is much of this movie that is open to the viewer's interpretation. The acting is also top notch. Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harding are up to the standard of the directing. Even the supporting cast does a great job with their scenes.Mulholland Drive is a difficult movie to enjoy. Its an incredibly niche movie that has almost no action scenes and derives its enjoyment from understanding of the plot. Attempting to understand the movie takes some effort.I highly recommend Mulholland Drive.Grade: A",8,0,0,2 March 2018

The movie stars Donnie Yen in the leading role and Lynn Hung as Cheung Wing-sing. The movie is about Ip man starting his school amidst the Japanese invasion of China. The movie covers Ip Man's life broadly.Ip Man is a well directed movie. This movie clocks in at a 108 minute running time. This felt quick as the entire movie flows well. All of the action scenes are fun to watch and masterfully choreographed. One of the highlights is Ip Man fighting for food. These scenes also have emotion going into them. This combination makes all the fight scenes important and fun to watch. If audience members only want to watch the movie for the action, they can easily enjoy all portions of it.The acting of this movie is decent. The movie has a good lead in Donnie Yen. He is able to portray the stoicism and emotion of Ip Man effectively. Likewise all of the supporting cast members do a great job with in their respective roles. All of the martial arts portrayed by the actors are top quality.The plot of the movie is basic. This is still an engrossing story. This movie is based off of historical events and Ip Man's life. I did not think this entire movie is accurate but is able to capture the spirit of Ip Man's struggle. This movie is primarily about the struggle between China and Japan during the latter's invasion of the former. This theme is inherently prevalent throughout the movie and it makes for anyone that enjoys this part of history enjoy the movie. There are a lot of authentic depictions of Chinese sentiment to Japan and vice-versa in this movie. This made the movie interesting to watch. The plot can seem similar to propaganda at times.I highly recommend 'Ip Man'. This is a solid biographical martial arts movie that is the complete package.Grade: A",8,1,1,12 January 2019
Logan," A somber end to Wolverine
","This review contains spoilers.Logan is the final Wolverine movie starring Hugh Jackman as the titular character. The movie is set in a futuristic world where mutants are hunted and becoming extinct. A young girl with the same powers of Wolverine is discovered and Logan finds himself helping his fellow mutants.From the beginning of the movie, Logan is already a departure from previous X-Men movies. The movie earns its R-rating by showing lots of gratuitous gore as people are cut into pieces by Wolverine. The scene also shows how drastically different the tone is. Wolverine is not a hero and works a menial job as a limousine driver. Professor X is revealed to have suffered a mental disorder that cuased the deaths of many mutants. Logan is not a hero in these scenes. His goal of earning money to move the professor away is neither heoric or villainous. The plot then moves to its main arc of Laura and follows Logan and Professor X on a road trip as they escape mercenaries searching for Laura. This plot is basic, but the execution is unique. The story is incredibly grungy and filled with twists that the audience may not expect. This is a gory and brutal story of characters being hunted. This movie transcends the typical superhero movies that are so common nowadays with a massive tonal change. This movie is nothing like the Marvel Cinematic Universe's movies with their light and humorous tone. It is for this reason that the movie deserves praise for trying something different for superheroes.I am hard pressed to find anything wrong about the movie. The directing, editing, and acting are all good in this movie. Patrick Steward does a good job as a mentally damaged Charles Xavier. This movie does not appear to fit into any of the confusing X-Men story-lines, but this is acceptable with how the movie is stand-alone. Previous X-Men movies are not required viewing to watch this movie.Logan is highly recommended. The movie is a shining example of what a comic book movie can aspire to be.Grade: A",8,1,3,10 June 2018

The movie is directed by Pierre Morel and written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, The movie stars Liam Neeson as a retired CIA field operative named Bryan Mills. Bryan Mills' daughter is kidnapped by a sex trafficking ring in France which provokes Bryan to find and rescue her.Taken is absolutely an engrossing thrill ride. The movie has great action scenes especially at the PG-13 rating the movie was assigned. The movie moves at an incredibly quick pace for its 90 minute running time. The movie has the hyper-competent Bryan Mills solve many mysteries off of a few clues that are given to him. This can make for an interesting watch as so much of the movie has Bryan's thought process presented on the screen. This makes for interesting scenes as Bryan pieces things together from clues and observations.In addition to watching thrilling investigations, the movie features exciting action scenes and chases. The action scenes are not anything new in the genre. However, Liam Neeson's performance and screen presence help elevate the movie this way.The movie features loads of action scenes. These action scenes have a unique flavor to each of them in either setting or execution.The movie does have decent acting but it is mostly bland. Liam Neeson is the exception here as he becomes a capable action movie star, None of the other actors stand out. This is more of a flaw on the writing and direction for focusing so much of it on Bryan Mills. The other actors do not have too much to work with from the script.The writing can feel basic and the direction bland at times. This is an action movie and not one that prioritizes depth in its writing. The action is executed well and it really does show in the box office results. This is a movie that is a nice surprise in the year of release. The movie should be watched with a low amount of expectations and the audience will be pleasantly surprised as I was.I would recommend 'Taken.' The movie is a solid action flick.Grade: B",8,1,1,16 February 2019

The Mummy Returns is the sequel to 1999's The Mummy and takes place years after the first movie. An enemy known as the Scorpion King returns with a resurrected Imhotep.The Mummy Returns is the definition of what a sequel should be. The movie contains elements of the first movie with the old villain of Imhotep. The movie introduces new elements that does not alienate fans of the original movie. It is overall a solid experience. If someone had liked the first movie they would enjoy watching The Mummy Returns. There are great scenes in this movie that are different than the first movie but they are the same thematically.The Mummy Returns is an inoffensive sequel and this is not meant as a bad thing. The Mummy Returns is a sequel that does everything that it needs to to please the audience. This is a great movie in both its action scenes, its setup, and production. Although it is not a great movie, it is an incredibly entertaining movie. The movie lacks in its story overall and it feels like a rehash of the first movie. However, I felt that this merely continued the theme of the first movie in a fun way and the movie is still enjoyable.I would recommend 'The Mummy Returns'.Grade: B",7,0,0,5 October 2019

John Lasseter writes and directs the sequel. The toys return in the sequel. Woody is stolen by a toy collector, causing the toys to set out on a mission to rescue him.'Toy Story 2' is different from the first movie.

This movie truly has something for everyone.The villains in this movie have good motives. The toy collector of Al McWhiggin simply wants to keep Woody toys in a museum. The villain is not completely evil and unreasonable. In a way, Al McWhiggin is similar to Toy Story's Sid. He does not know that the toys are sentient. The secondary antagonist of Stinky Pete has a motivation to want to be protected. He had the right idea in wanting to be preserved.The cast does an excellent jb in this movie. The performances by Tom Hanks and Tim Allen is solid. The new cast of Joan Cusack playing Jessie, and Jeff Pidgeon as the aliens are great additions. The movie utilizes all of the cast members well across all of its scenes.I would recommend 'Toy Story 2.'Grade: B",8,0,1,27 May 2019
Reservoir Dogs," A great thriller
","This review contains spoilers.Reservoir Dogs is a heist movie written by and directed by Quentin Tarantino. The movie stars Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Lawrence Tierney, and Michael Madsen. The movie is a heist movie about a heist that goes wrong. The criminals try to find a way out as the police close in on them.The writing in Reservoir Dogs is top notch. Quentin Tarantino wrote all of the characters with sharp and focused dialogue that engages the audience consistently. The movie's dialogue is great to listen to and requires the audience to pay attention. There are many great scenes such as a discussion about tips that make the audience laugh and become interested in its relevance. The movie is absolutely filled with dialogue such as these. The movie uses this dialogue to give more detail to the characters and have an authentic moment. The direction by Quentin Tarantino is also praise worthy.The direction is well done for the relatively low budget of the movie. All of the scenes in this movie felt intense. The characters had a distinct style in every scene. I always felt that every scene had its intention clearly carried out onto the screen. It may not always be glamorous but the direction conveys everything well.The characters and acting are the best components in the movie. After the failed heist, it becomes clear that the jewelry store was a setup. One of the characters, Mr. Orange, is shot and critically wounded. The interaction between him and the rest of the characters is great to watch untold. If was awesome watching these characters act realistically.I would recommend 'Reservoir Dogs.' This movie is solid in both its concept and execution. At a 99 minute running time the movie is tight and focused.Grade: B",9,0,1,16 February 2019
Total Recall," A fun and thoughtful science-fiction movie
","This review contains spoilers.Total Recall is a 1990 film directed by Paul Verhoeven. The story is written by Ronald Shusett, Dan O'Bannon, and Jon Povill. The movie is based on the short story 'We Can Remember It For You Wholesale' by Philip K. Dick. The movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger playing a construction worker named Douglas Quaid. He opts for a memory implant that gives him a memory trip as a Martian secret agent.The movie is a great action, science-fiction movie that actually had a lot to say. There is a running theme of reality that pervades this movie. The movie absolutely opens with this theme with Douglas Quaid having memories of Mars. This increases only when Douglas Quaid attempts to get a memory implant. From the beginning of the movie, there is already a doubt whether Douglas' reality is real. I enjoyed this theme immensely as it absolutely made the movie more exciting to watch.The action in this movie is at a good level. There are many fun and exciting action pieces as Douglas goes from Earth to Mars. These action scenes also add more to the story as it leads to that theme of reality. These scenes have a different take on multiple viewings. The scenes are also great by their effects.Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job in the leading role of Douglas Quaid. Arnold is normally a fun action movie star. He is still in that role here but he has a different take on it in this movie. He is more unsure and seems more like an every man. This performance fits the movie as it always makes the themes more apparent. It is harder to imagine Douglas Quaid taking out scores of enemies. It is also hard to imagine that Douglas Quaid simply gets contacts out of nowhere.Paul Verhoeven does a great job with the directing in this movie. There is hardly a scene that fails to get its point across. In addition the movie is beautiful and gets prettier as it goes on. This is a movie that rewards audiences that pay attention to the small details.I highly recommend Total Recall. The movie is a deep and solid science-fiction movie.Grade: A",9,0,0,29 December 2018
Rocky," A Cinderella story
","This review contains spoilers.Rocky is a sports drama movie that premiered in 1976. The movie is directed by John G. Avildsen and written by Sylvester Stallone. The movie stars Sylvester Stallone and Talia Shire. The movie is about an aspiring boxer that seeks to challenge a heavyweight boxing champion. The movie tracks Rocky Balboa's training and ultimate duel with Apollo Creed.Rocky is a great sports movie. The movie hits many story beats and can rouse the audience into cheering on Rocky's training and duel. This movie has great pacing and structure that makes the movie tight and focused. The 119 minutes of running time is quick and Sylvester Stallone's performance as Rocky Balboa is excellent. Sylvester Stallone is able to portray the gruff and required focus that Rocky Balboa was called to.Other than being a sports movie, there is not much to Rocky. This may disappoint audiences but it forms a movie that can be forgettable if one does not get involved with the story of Rocky. The movie ultimately does not have any grand transcending quality to it other than being an excellent sports movie. Any audience that does not care for sports will find the experience greatly lacking in the viewing of this movie.I would recommend 'Rocky'.Grade: B",8,0,0,7 September 2019
Sicario," A beautiful and tense movie
","This review contains spoilers.Sicario is an action thriller film that premiered in 2015. The movie is directed by Denis Villeneuve and stars Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro, and Josh Brolin. The movie follows Kate Macer played by Emily Blunt that discovers cartel activity in a FBI raid. Kate and her partner join a task force that seeks to bring the cartel to justice.Denis Villeneuve should be commended for his great directing. This direction is one of the movies biggest strengths as the entire movie is pretty to watch. Every scene sets up the stakes well and also the intention of every scene is crystal clear. This movie has gorgeous panoramic vistas and overhead shots. There is a night vision and thermal scene that simply is cool to experience.The action in the action scenes are not the complete focus in Sicario. This movie prefers to set up the plot of the movie and prioritize that for its action set pieces. This is absolutely worth the build-up as it makes the action scenes and the effects of it more satisfying. One of the examples in this movie is when the tunnel is raided. The tunnel being raided is both a cool scene to watch as well as leading to the finale that built up Alejandro. The movie is riddled with examples like this that make the movie more exciting to watch.All of the actors do a great performance in this movie Emily Blunt's Kate Macer is a naive Federal Bureau of Investigation agent in the world of the Mexican drug cartel. Kate is more of the audience's character than a character that is meant to be mysterious. The characters that take the show are Benicio del Toro's Alejandro and Josh Brolin's Matt Graver. These two character's experience in the world of the Mexican cartels is evident. The movie's secret protagonist is Benicio del Toro's Alejandro. This character undergoes his own personal story that both Kate Macer and the audience experiences.There are some aspects of the movie that are meandering without much point. One of these is the plot with Mexican police officer Silvio. This plot got pointless and did not connect with the main story well. The story was already understood to impact many civilian lives. When Silvio runs into Alejandro the result is already clear. The entire setup was not worth the result.I would recommend Sicario. The movie is a tight action thriller.Grade: B",7,0,0,25 November 2018
The Shape of Water," Magic
","This review contains spoilers.The Shape of Water is directed by Guillermo del Toro and stars Sally Hawkins. Sally Hawkins plays a lonely mute woman that encounters a captured aquatic being at work. Meanwhile a Russian spy discovers the creature and wants to preserve its life.The Shape of Water has classic themes from Guillermo del Toro's other works. He likes to present fantastical beasts in a realistic setting. Typically the villain is someone that wants to exploit either the creature or the main character in the story. The main character discovers something magical and seeks out adventure. With these tropes in mind, one can see how similar The Shape of Water is with Pan's Labyrinth. The main character's motivations for helping the aquatic being is altruistic. The movie takes place in the United States, with the villain being a military commander that wants to research the alien creature.The cast does a great job in this movie. Sally Hawkins is the stand-out cast member. She portrays the mute woman well by acting with sign language and body language. Without words, she could portray her character's emotions to the audience well. She also garners the audience's empathy by allowing them to understand her character's plight.The directing and editing give the movie a fast pace. The scenes are all aesthetically pleasing. The pace of the movie is intense without being too fast. Every scene is thoughtfully planned beforehand. The CGI is used appropriately in this movie with no scenes being too jarring.The only criticism I have of the movie is perhaps the one-dimensional villain. There was nothing redeeming about him, and he existed for only one purpose. His only motivation for his deeds appeared to only be greed. He also sexually harasses the main character for seemingly no reason other than to establish his own villainy.I recommend The Shape of Water. The movie is a magical adventure that explores the nature of connection between individuals.Grade: B",7,17,30,24 April 2018
The Matrix Reloaded," An expanded convoluted universe
","This review contains spoilers.The Matrix Reloaded is a science fiction movie that premiered in 2003. The movie is directed by The Wachowskis, produced by Joel Silver, written by The Wachowskis, and stars Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Hugo Weaving. The movie is the sequel to the 1999 movie The Matrix. The movie follows a few months after the conclusion of The Matrix. Neo has become able to manipulate reality in The Matrix and the resistance discovers an army of sentinels that will destroy Zion.The Matrix Reloaded continues the same awe inspiring action that composed the first original movie. The movie has excellent action set pieces and awesome choreographed scenes. There are loads of these scenes scattered across its 138 minutes of running time. There are scenes that are extremely exciting to watch. The highlights are the highway chase that Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus find themselves in. The movie uses the aspects of The Matrix to great effect and allows the audience a great set piece in that highway chase. The action in general is also well-produced and well done across the actors.The Matrix Reloaded suffers from problems in the concept and execution in the sequel. This sequel has multiple problems in its effects, and story. The effects in this movie seem to be a step down compared to the first Matrix movie. The Matrix Reloaded has great effects but they do not age as well as The Matrix. The movie looks much like a video game in certain scenes. One of these scenes is the burly brawl scene that has Neo fighting against Smith clones. This scene appears incredibly fake and the use of computer generated imagery is evident. Watching this scene today, the scene does not have the allure as the first movie's effects. In other instances such as the highway chase, The Matrix Reloaded does a great job in utilizing a mixture of computer generated imagery and practical effects. It seems that the movie could have done better in utilizing more practical effects.The story in The Matrix Reloaded has many problems. The first of which is the overly convoluted plot. In the first Matrix movie, the story had a basic plot that was easy to follow. There were still interesting aspects in the side that audience can notice. This movie rewarded both audiences that cared about the foreground story and the background story. The Matrix Reloaded requires that the audience pay attention to small pieces of dialogue in order to understand what happens in the plot. The plot is told in the small dialogue pieces between both The Merovingian and The Architect. Even characters from the first Matrix movie like The Oracle deserves mention as they play into this overall plot. The movie requires the audience to pay more attention and the pay off that they get is not great. The movie explains that The One is one in many cycles that the machines have already gone through. Neo is left with a choice of saving humanity or saving Trinity.The movie utilizes Smith once more in this movie. Although it was great watching Hugo Weaving reprise his role, the movie seems to contrive the reason for bringing him back. The Matrix Reloaded explains this with Smith being brought back because he had the will to stay and that Neo possibly imprinted onto him. The reason does not make sense as Smith in the first movie wanted to destroy humanity such that he no longer needed to tend to the zoo of humans in the matrix. The Matrix Reloaded wants to make the audience believe this but it feels contrived. Smith's return is because they wanted to maintain the philosophical discussions that happened in the first movie. The role could have easily been maintained by The Architect that Neo meets later.There are many new side characters compared to the first movie. This movie expands the universe of The Matrix. The movie does not utilize the side characters well. These side characters only have one or two lines and they can easily be cut in order to provide for more of a focused watch. The movie should have been extended if the movie really did want to create this expanded universe of The Matrix.I would recommend 'The Matrix Reloaded'.Grade: B",8,0,0,19 October 2019
Joker," A slower psychological movie
","This review contains spoilers.Joker is a psychological thriller movie that premiered in 2019. The movie is based on the DC comics character Joker. The movie is directed by Todd Phillips, and written by Todd Phillips, and Scott Silver. The movie stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck a down on his luck party clown.Joker is an interesting origin story for the titular character. The movie is a slow look at the insanity that Arthur Fleck descends into. He battles his psychological problems and discovers facts about his mother that disturb him. The movie focuses the 122 minutes of running time on Arthur Fleck as the audience sees his mental state deteriorating. The movie has an incredibly dark tone that should be commended. The movie explored the use of a villain as the main character and the setting of Gotham being a rundown urban city was the opposite of how Gotham is portrayed in other media. The city is much more threatening than how the city looked from Bruce Wayne's perspective.Joker does not shy away from the unpleasant aspects of mental illness and destitution. The movie portrays the helplessness that is felt by someone like Arthur Fleck with accuracy. This character comes to identify the lower classes both in Gotham and in urban centers around the world. The idea of a character that does not stand for anything becoming a symbol is believable in this movie.The movie is open to interpretation. As the first act of the movie ends, Arthur's medication is cut due to lack of funding at the mental center that he checks in at. The first act of the movie reflects reality but then later Arthur begins having delusions. These delusions plague on the audience interprets the movie as they only see the movie through Arthur's eyes. There is no other perspective in this movie. The other characters do react realistically but they react only to Arthur Fleck. The later portions of the movie become less believable as Arthur is executing seemingly impossible plans. The movie does try to ground the audience with real events by showing them through the television. This was an interesting approach but the movie becomes similar to other movies that this movie is a fan of. One of these movies is The King of Comedy (1982) where the entire ending finale is pulled from The King of Comedy. Much of Arthur Fleck's goals are similar to the goals found in The King of Comedy that it makes the movie feel less original.Despite some of the problems in Joker's originality, Joaquin Phoenix's performance makes this movie. He is a perfect Joker and the actor masterfully reflects the descent into insanity that characterizes the Joker. I would recommend Joker.Grade: B",6,2,2,14 March 2020
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Outstanding comedy
","This review contains spoilers.Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is a comedy movie that premiered in 2004. The movie is written by Adam McKay and written by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay. The movie stars Will Ferrell, Christina Applegate, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell, and David Koechner. The movie is about a news anchor in San Diego and his misadventures in the 1970s.Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is a fantastic movie. This movie has many well executed comedy scenes where the movie plays to its strengths incredibly well. The casting of the stars and even supporting cast make the movie's line deliveries perfect. This movie has some of the greatest line delivery by Will Ferrell playing Ron Burgundy. Ron Burgundy's rival, Wes Mantooth played by Vince Vaughn, does such an excellent job in every scene that these are classics in my eyes. The movie depends a lot on the cast and the cast absolutely delivers in all of their lines. It makes for an enjoyable experience if the audience only wants to watch character driven comedy.The downside I have to the movie is its tendency to meander. There is not much of an overarching story in this movie at all. The movie suffers from a lack of focus as the movie focuses on gags that the cast plays. It makes for an experience where the characters have events that do not lead to any substantial conclusion. This is likely not a problem for most audiences but anybody expecting a story to go along with the comedy will not find it here. This movie turns its actors and actresses loose with the script and lets them have fun.I would recommend 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy'.Grade: B",8,1,1,21 September 2019
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A bloated conclusion
","This review contains spoilers.The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is the conclusion to the Hobbit trilogy. This movie is the sequel to The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. The movie follows the group of Dwarves as they enter the Lonely Mountain and prepare to fight a battle. The Battle of the Five Armies is directed by Peter Jackson.The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is still as bloated as the previous movie, The Desolation of Smaug. This is a massive problem pas it makes the movie narratively vapid. Much of this causes the movie to be fun to look at, but the scenes do not have much natural weight behind it. Even the massive battle in this movie that is built up across the series had nothing going for the narrative. There is much going on in this movie but it did not feel fulfilling.The entire plot with Thorin telt superfluous like the previous movie felt with its story-lines. The movie should have focused on this story and tried to hint at it more in the previous movies. The plot should have focused on what the book focused on instead of the new characters the movie features.Once again the movie is impressive visually in both the standard frame rate and 48 frames per second. Anyone that really watches this move for the visual eye-candy will enjoy it. There are many sequences in this movie that are pretty to look at. The Laketown and battle sequences are the highlights here.The love plot with Tauriel and Kili reaches its conclusion here. As expected the plot lead nowhere. This plot like the rest of the movie was not fulfilling for the narrative as this event just happens. I believe that if the re-shoots did not happen this would make the movie better.Overall, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is a bloated mess. I would still recommend watching it for the conclusion to the Hobbit Trilogy.Grade: C",7,0,0,17 November 2018
Inception," Awesome action and original plot

The movie is produced by Emma Thomas and Christopher Nolan. The movie stars Leonardo Dicaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, and Ellen Page. The movie follows a group of thieves that steal information by infiltrating the target's dreams. Dom Cobb, played by Leonardo Dicaprio leads the thieves and is forced into one last heist to have his criminal past history removed.Christopher Nolan knocks at it out of the park with this movie. This movie is both visually exciting and directorially interesting to watch. There are so many awesome set pieces and effects in this movie. All of this is helped by the explanation of dreaming. Any setting is possible and all of the scenes are creative. The main heist the movie focuses on is a multi-part sequence that works incredibly well. The movie puts less of a focus on the real-life aspects of the movie and this is not the focus.The actual writing in this movie is excellent. This writing provides a solid foundation for the rest of the movie to work off of. Much of the writing is so well done that it makes these somewhat one-dimensional characters more interesting. The writing is great in setting up scenes, dialogue, and world. The writing is not so good at explaining and making the audience invested in the characters. The only character that the audience might care about is Dom Cobb.Dom Cobb is played incredibly well by Leonardo Dicaprio. This character has an interesting story with his deceased wife that is explained well. This character is most likely the only character the audience will remember. The other characters are in more supporting roles that the movie does not focus on. The other characters are not given any other interactions besides interactions pertinent to the plot.The movie may also feel over bloated with such a large cast and the point of view switching constantly. I did not find this to be a big issue but the movie does drag when it wants to set up ideas and designs. These ideas being mainly the conflict between Dom Cobb and Mal Cobb, played by Marion Cotillard.I would recommend Inception. The movie is solid. The movie is also rewatchable with many small details being revealed on multiple watches.Grade: B",8,0,0,9 December 2018
Sherlock Holmes," A strange working fit
","This review contains spoilers.Sherlock Holmes is a 2009 action mystery movie. The film is based off of the Sherlock Holmes character written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The movie is directed by Guy Ritchie. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law portray Sherlock Holmes and Dr John Watson respectively. Sherlock Holmes and Dr John Watson are hired to foil a mystic plot in London.Sherlock Holmes is an incredibly fun movie. This movie has an electric style of editing and directing which makes the movie fast-paced and exciting. This Sherlock Holmes rendition has a different more youthful approach to the Sherlock Holmes character than other renditions of the character. This character has activities that the audience would not typically associate with Sherlock Holmes. One of these activities is boxing. It is crazy to think that this actually works in the movie's favor. The movie is able to portray the quirkiness and methodical nature of Sherlock Holmes' across all of the actions that he does.The actual mystery in this movie can feel overly-convoluted. Since this movie is a Sherlock Holmes mystery, this movie had to have some grand mystery and reveal. The movie has a grand reveal but it felt like the movie could have done without a grand reveal. I had a good time with how the movie portrayed the era and characters that the grand mystery was only a small plus for me. I could have easily enjoyed the movie without the convoluted plot.The action in this movie is grounded and is excellent. Once it was shown that Sherlock is a brawler, there was an expectation that the movie could have exciting fist fights. The movie meets this expectation and has great Victorian era fighting scenes. These scenes are bolstered by Robert Downey Jr.'s performance.The acting across the cast is great. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law as the leading roles do an awesome job. The main villain of Lord Henry Blackwood played by Mark Strong does a compelling job. Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler plays her role perfectly.The movie does have the fault of not being a stand-out movie. The scenes here do not excel at any one component but it does make the movie immensely watchable. The movie has no terrible scenes, but it does not have the greatest scenes either.I would recommend 'Sherlock Holmes.' This is a solid action mystery movie.Grade: B",8,1,1,13 April 2019
Finding Dory," Solid if expected
","This review contains spoilers.Finding Dory is a computer animated movie that premiered in 2016. The movie is directed by Andrew Stanton. The story is written by Andrew Stanton with the screenplay by both Andrew Stanton and Victoria Strouse. The movie stars Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks, and Hayden Rolence. The movie is a follow-up/spin off of Finding Nemo. Dory, the forgetful regal blue tang, searches for her parents.It has been thirteen years since the first installment in this franchise. Finding Dory has been a long awaited sequel with many of the younger fans of the first movie having grown up. This movie needed to appeal to kids and the older audience. Does this movie appeal to both audiences? I would say that it does. The movie is similar to the first movie by having its themes be something that all audiences can relate to. The movie has great thrills for all audiences. However, this does not match the original's feel.Ellen DeGeneres and Albert Brooks reprise their roles of Dory and Marvin respectively. The two voice actors continue doing a good job in this movie. The movie uses the characters to their best but the originality and freshness from the first movie is lost in Finding Dory. This does not make Finding Dory an awful movie. It simply makes Finding Dory a movie that is more predictable and expected. There are not many massive twists or introductions.The entire sequence in the aquarium is awesome. This sequence has Dory with an octopus trying to escape. The computer animation and dialogue across this sequence is great to watch. It also brought back the idea of children that do not understand their actions might kill fish. The entire sequence is fun to watch but it felt like it took the themes from Finding Nemo rather than creating something new.Like the first movie, the sequel sets a high standard for animation and effects. There is much to appreciate in this movie from a technical standpoint. All of the characters are well animated and the scenes themselves are well directed. It made for an experience that is worthy of the Pixar Animation name.I would recommend 'Finding Dory.' This is a solid family friendly movie.Grade: B",8,0,1,15 June 2019
Prometheus," A returning mess
","This review contains spoilers.Prometheus is a science-fiction movie that premiered in 2012. The movie is directed by Ridley Scott and written by Jon Spaihts, and Damon Lindelof. The movie stars Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender. A mysterious star chart is found in Scotland that is interpreted as an invitation from humanity's forebearers. An expedition is put forth by the Weyland corporation to investigate the planet.Prometheus is an incredibly messy movie. This movie has many problems in its writing that served to hinder audience enjoyment of the movie. These problems were the characters of the expedition doing increasingly dumb and non-sensical things. Among these were a biologist that was scared of centuries old corpses. The biologists should not be scared of this finding and it felt incredibly out of place. The biologist should have been willing to investigate the corpse further. However later when the same biologist finds an aggressive mutated snake, the biologist is willing to antagonize it. The movie failed to provide this character with consistency. Somehow a geologist that was able to create a map of the facility got lost such that they were stuck inside of the facility. This made no sense and could have been written better.The movie also does not explain any of its elements well. The movie leaves a lot to mystery and suspense. Audiences expecting answers to the creation of the Xenomorph from the Alien movies will be disappointed here. The movies does not explain it although a proto-Xenomorph is present at the end of the movie. The creatures found in this movie resemble creatures found in the first Alien movie. However the movie does not elaborate on any of the Engineer's motivations. It offers a simple hand wave and action for the audience to come to their own conclusion. In this way it is similar to the first Alien movie with the audience and Ripley encountering the Alien and not understanding its biology or life-cycle.The movie does play to its leads incredibly well. Noomi Rapace and Elizabeth Shaw and Michael Fassbender as David the Android do a great job in their respective roles. These two characters hold up the whole story and it was a good decision of casting the actor and actress. The characters are fun to watch and they have the best scenes in the movie.The movie is tense and exciting. Ridley Scott is able to achieve a level of excitement and tension in the movie across its 124 minutes of running time. The movie is gorgeous and well shot.I would recommend Prometheus even with its flaws.Grade: C",7,0,2,14 March 2020
Taken 2," Grenade sonar
","This review contains spoilers.Taken 2 is the sequel to 2008's Taken. The movie is an action thriller film that is directed by Olivier Megaton and written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen. The movie takes place some time after the first Taken movie and stars the same cast. The movie has the Albanians from the first movie returning to exact revenge on Bryan Mills and his family.Taken 2 features the tight action from the original movie in its 91 minute running time. This time however, the money is not as fresh or intelligently executed. Bryan Mills and his wife are taken which causes his daughter to assist in their rescue. The entire movie feels so contrived as the movie finds reasons to continue the running time. The story's beginning feels like a terrible introduction. The Albanians want revenge and nothing else. They decide to take the entire family when they know Bryan was separated from his wife. It is an amazingly contrived situation that the Mills family decided to go on a vacation in Istanbul when the Albanians sought revenge.This is not the only deficiency in the writing. The writing has strange scenes. Somehow Bryan Mills carries around high explosive grenades in his briefcase. The grenades are used for Bryan to find the location where he is kidnapped. This scene has grenades being thrown into public areas in Istanbul to utilize sound location. This scene is not the only immersion breaking scene. The movie has Bryan Mills, and his daughter drive into the United States embassy as they are being shot at. For some reason, the movie thought that this was the best option rather than have the scene play out normally. These scenes changed how I will see the Taken franchise. There is simply so many poorly executed scenes that hold down the rest of the movie.Liam Neeson is still great in the role of Bryan Mills. I do not see any large flaws except the ridiculous scenes he became involved in. He did a good job but I wish he had stopped the ridiculous scenes from playing out. It made the movie tough to watch.I would not recommend 'Taken 2.'Grade: D",4,0,0,25 February 2019
Black Panther," An interesting look even if formulaic
","This review contains spoilers.Black Panther is a continuation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe that centers on the Black Panther characters that was first introduced in Captain America: Civil War. T'challa leads the African nation of Wakanda, a technologically advanced isolationist country using vibranium. T'challa formally becomes the Black Panther in a ritual but soon discovers an old historical relic that seeks to undo his legacy. Killmonger is revealed to be his uncle's son and seeks the throne of Wakanda for himself.Black Panther is a riveting movie focused on its action set pieces and its setting. Much like the other Marvel movies, Black Panther has highly explosive and plot important action set pieces that have cool effects. The directing is much better at the action rather than the character dialogue. The dialogue has a different feel from the more humorous entries of Thor: Ragnarok and Guardians of the Galaxy. Black Panther adopts a more serious tone with some touches of comedy. Overall the dialogue is well written and helps bring the viewer into the setting. The setting of Wakanda and characters is easily the more interesting part of this movie. The movie uses this to its advantage by doling out parts of the setting and environment in bits. The culture and people of Wakanda is its more interesting part and by the end of the movie, I still wanted to know more about it.The main arc with Killmonger and T'challa hit some emotional moments but eventually descends into typical superhero stories. Killmonger creates a villain for Wakanda to prioritize. He then returns to the hidden kingdom to enact revenge for his father. He accomplishes this by seemingly killing T'challa and becoming the new Black Panther. Somehow a kingdom that embraces tradition and isolationism embraces his violent actions and commands without rebellion. The movie wanted an excuse to have a large scale battle but did not have the heart to back it.Overall, Black Panther is a strong entry into the Marvel cinematic universe. I would recommend this movie.Grade: C",7,1,3,8 April 2018
Iron Man," Heart, action, and comedy
","This review contains spoilers.Iron Man is a superhero movie that premiered in 2008. The movie is directed by Jon Favreau, produced by Avi Arad, and Kevin Feige. The movie is based on the character Iron Man by Stan Lee. The movie stars Robert Downey Jr. in the titular role. The movie follows billionaire arms dealer Tony Stark that gets captured and must construct an iron man suit to escape. Afterwards, he changes his ways as he must battle a terrorist organization.Iron Man is a great movie. This movie has everything that audiences will love in the running time of 126 minutes. There are great action scenes powered by Robert Downey Jr.'s acting. He does an excellent job playing the suave billionaire weapons contractor that designs the Iron Man suit. The movie puts everything together well and makes the audience care. The movie is the origin story of Iron Man and shows how he came to be a superhero.This movie has great side characters and an interesting villain. Jeff Bridges plays Obadiah Stane that becomes the Iron Monger. It was good watching Jeff Bridges in the role and it does make it seem like the villain did not have enough characterization. The other side characters like Pepper Potts, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, does well in the role and makes for an interesting dynamic between her and Tony Stark.My only criticism of the movie would be its bland direction. It does not do anything unique in its direction which I believed it could have. This movie is an origin story which has been seen before. The only differences is the suaveness of Tony Stark and the setting. The movie is ultimately interesting in the approach of creating a cinematic universe that seeks to link all of the Marvel characters together.I recommend 'Iron Man'.Grade: B",8,0,1,2 January 2020
Casino Royale," Welcome back Bond
","This review contains spoilers.Casino Royale is an action spy movie that premiered in 2006. The movie is directed by Martin Campbell and is based on the book Casino Royale by Ian Fleming. The movie stars Daniel Craig as James Bond. James Bond starts as an a MI6 agent that earns his license to kill. James Bond becomes involved in a high stakes poker game that a criminal organization uses to recouperate lost money.Casino Royale is very much a movie that moves James Bond into the modern era. This movie is a departure from the older James Bond movies. There are no fancy gadgets from the Pierce Brosnan era of Bond. These are spies given the best equipment possible which are only networks equipment and a gun. This can seem like a disappointment to anyone that looked forward to interesting gadgets. Casino Royale makes up for this with much more electric action than its older movies. The movie feel more like the Bourne series rather than the older Bond movies. The movies simply have similar action scenes. The movie does have some returning features from the previous movies like Bond's preferences. This has some twists to them.The casting choice of Daniel Craig, as Bond is mostly a good choice. It feels like Daniel Craig brings forth a more grounded Bond. I personally did not like this but it is fitting for the movie's plot. Bond is beginning his career as 007 here and the audience sees him vulnerable and fallible. I enjoyed watching Pierce Brosnan's bond partly due to the pulpiness of the series. Pierce has a more careless reaction as everything seemed to be easier to Brosnan's Bond. The portrayal of Bond by Daniel Craig felt much more like Jason Bourne than a suave spy. The movie at least has James Bond go through a journey that makes Daniel Craig's portrayal more authentic.The action in this movie is incredibly well-done. The movie has well-shot action where the audience can follow every tense moment easily. The movie has many action moments that are well paced out by the movie. The movie also made poker seem more tense and thrilling than it should be. The action and tension did not feel contrived and the movie had good reasons for every action scene.The story in this movie is different from other James Bond movies. The movie has a long-spanning story arc that does not end in this installment. The movie has a promise to continue the story arc that the cliffhanger conclusion in this movie has. Both Mr. White and Le Chifre have a good screen presence in the movie which pervades a sense of mystery. This made the move more engrossing to watch.I would recommend 'Casino Royale.' The movie is a solid start to the new Bond series.Grade: B",8,1,3,3 March 2019

The movie is written by John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, and Lee Unkrich. The movie stars Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and Joan Cusack. Andy is preparing for college and the toys are despondent. They prepare for a life in the attic when they are forced into an adventure.'Toy Story 3' is the transition movie for Toy Story fans. This movie has the audience and Andy both growing up past 'Toy Story' and 'Toy Story 2.' This theme is continued past the opening scene in 'Toy Story 3.' The movie has the theme of growing up in Andy and the movie's own release date. The movie's release happened more than ten years after the second movie. The movie definitely kept this in mind and crafted the themes this way. It contributes a lot to the enjoyment by adults. There are still lots of things for the younger audiences.Ned Beatty plays Lotso the bear. This villain is played perfectly by the actor and directed wall. This villain does an awesome job being the tyrant of Sunnyside. The movie introduces the toys of Sunnyside incredibly well. The movie creates this new and dangerous world well. The movie still has great scenes even after the escape from Sunnyside.I would recommend 'Toy Story 3.'Grade: B",9,0,0,2 June 2019
Midway," Ambitious but muddled
","This review contains spoilers.Midway is a war movie that premiered in 2019. The movie is directed by Roland Emmerich and written by Wes Tooke. The movie features an ensemble cast of Hollywood and foreign actors. The movie covers events before, during, and after the real life Battle of Midway.Midway is an incredibly jumbled movie. The movie is chronological in the events that it depicts, however there are many loose threads of stories that are loosely connected in this movie. The movie is ultimately too ambitious for its 138 minutes of running time. The movie starts 1937 when the relations between the United States and Japan are breaking down. The movie then transitions to the attack on Pearl Harbor. The audience does not get into the Battle of Midway until the movie is well underway. The lead up to the battle is not as well earned as the events seem incredibly disparate. The different characters do not intertwine in a meaningful way. In addition the movie does not feature a protagonist. We follow many different perspectives. The closest character that comes close to being a protagonist is Edwin Layton portrayed by Patrick Wilson. The movie frequently switches to perspectives of the bombing squadron to tell their story.Midway is a visual treat and the movie does treat the history with respect. I did enjoy the movie discussed the Japanese perspective as they began the battle. The battle itself is impressive to watch in this movie. The United States pilots are portrayed as heroic with the Japanese pilots not being featured much. The one item that was missing was the bombing of Yorktown. The Yorktown carrier being attacked is cut to after the bomb had already devastated the carrier. It felt cheap to the audience that we were not able to see the Japanese retaliate after their carrier fleet was decimated.The direction and writing of the movie could have been in better hands however the movie has enough enjoyable elements for the viewers.I would recommend 'Midway'.Grade: C",6,1,1,4 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A familiar successor
","This review contains spoilers.Star Wars Episode VII - The Force Awakens is the sequel to Star Wars Episode VI - Return of the Jedi. The Force Awakens is the first entry to the Star Wars sequel trilogy. The movie is directed by J.J. Abrams and written by Lawrence Kasdan, J.J. Abrams, and Michael Arndt. The movie has Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Anthony Daniels, and Peter Mayhew reprising their roles of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, C-3PO, and Chewbacca respectively. The new cast is composed of Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, Daisy Ridley as Rey, John Boyega as Finn, and Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron. The story follows the rise of the First Order as they seek a missing Luke Skywalker.The Force Awakens is a rehash of Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope. The plot and story structure is incredibly similar. Both movies start with a droid having an important object that wanters and encounters the character that will become a Jedi. The villains build a superweapon that destroys a planet. The movie ends with the characters destroying the superweapon. Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens played it too safe. There is not much originality in this Star Wars episode. I am hard pressed to think of what story or plot that this movie does differently. The only things that are different are its environment, characters, and technology.The environment looks the same and is named differently. Jakku and Tatooine function the same way with regards to its plot. Likewise, the movie explored different planets that are pretty to look at but are vapid. The characters in this movie are different. The highlight here is John Boyega as Finn. I enjoyed his character arc where he goes from a First Order trooper to a Resistance fighter. Poe Dameron does not get as much screen time but he does well in the movie. Daisy Ridley as Rey is the star in this movie and she does well in her role. What is not good is Rey as a character.Rey is a bland character. I had hoped there would be more of a character arc with her, but this mostly involves her use of Force powers instead of interesting character interactions. The only good character interactions she had is with Han Solo. Even with her interaction it was all to show how adept she is at every skill she employs. This is the main difference and why I thought Finn is a better character. He had his shortcomings but still had a conflict. By the end of the movie, he had tried overcoming them and had more involved character interactions across the movie.Even with the flaws above, the movie does a good job with everything else. The movie uses its action and effects well. Every action moment plays an important event in the story. The action is also well-shot and directed. J.J. Abrams can make an exciting science-fiction movie. The main scene that is well done is the X-Wing fight on Takodana.Overall, I would recommend Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force AwakensGrade: B",8,1,14,27 October 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A Fond Farewell
","This review contains spoilers.The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is the sequel to The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. The movie is the concluding movie to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The movie premiered in 2003 and features the same cast from the previous movies. The movie continues where the previous movie left off.Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, and Gollum, are lead into Mordor. The trio are beset with internal conflicts started by Gollum. The three encounter more creatures of Mordor along with a giant spider known as Shelob. This perspective is the main story of the Lord of the Rings and it is great to its conclusion here. The pair of Hobbits were completely different characters from the beginning of the trilogy to the end. Frodo and Samwise go from isolationist hobbits to embracing the adventure and sacrifice needed to bring The One Ring to Mount Doom. It was heartwarming to see these two friends not give up on each other when hope seemed lost. Both Sean Astin and Elijah Wood, do a good performance here. I could see that the two are proud of their performance.The other plot concerns the defense of Minas Tirith in Gondor as Mordor seeks to end the age of men. This story follows Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, King Theoden, Eomer, and Arwen. This story features a desperate defense of the multi-layered city of Minas Tirith and a quest to give more time to Frodo and Samwise. This entire story is incredibly epic. The directing by Peter Jackson is some of the best with the Battle of Pelennor Fields being a highlight. There is nothing that this story does wrong from a narrative or visual standpoint. The battles in this movie are worth the price of an admission alone.The only weakness of the movie is perhaps the ending being overly long. I could feel that this part of the movie became almost pointless. Once The One Ring was destroyed, the movie, transitioned into its epilogue. The movie let the audience see the characters one final time before concluding. This conclusion brought a somber conclusion to the story rather than an abrupt one. The story did however focus on Frodo and his reaction to the end of the journey. This helped the story conclude as we could see the effects the journey had on Frodo Baggins. I personally enjoyed this conclusion towards the end.The extended cut is highly recommended over the theatrical cut. The extended cut offers many cool scenes and develops an already rich world. The extended cut is still only for fans and anyone watching the movie passively will not get much out of it.I highly recommend The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.Grade: A
The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy is one of the best movie trilogies. This trilogy will truly stand the test of time as both a cinematic and technical marvel. Although the weakest movie is The Two Towers this is not a weak movie by any stretch. Each of the movies contributed to each other in meaningful ways and Peter Jackson should be applauded for keeping the three movies at such high quality.Grade: A",9,0,0,17 November 2018

The movie is directed by The Wachowskis, produced by Joel Silver, written by The Wachowskis and stars Keanu Reeves, and Laurence Fishburne. The movie features a dystopian future where humanity has lost the war against artificial intelligence. A hacker awakens to this reality and joins the rebellion against the machines.The Matrix is a classic movie. This movie features many effects that were ahead of its time and has proven influential to any movies that feature martial arts. This is a great movie in its action, effects, and even set pieces. There are so many great parts of this movie that the audience can appreciate on a technical level. The movie succeeds in entertaining its audience on a purely technical level. Even the effects still hold up today.The story in this movie follows a pattern of the hero's journey. It is a classic tale that has the main character of Neo come to revelation of the domination of the machines. Eventually through work and sacrifice he ascends to the prophecy of the one. This journey is exciting to watch and it is made more interesting by the world of The Matrix. The movie features themes of sacrifice, truth, and utopia. The movie embodies these themes in both its main character and villain of Agent Smith.Agent Smith is played by Hugo Weaving and is one of the grand pillars in The Matrix. The Matrix is a great movie due to both Agent Smith's lines and Hugo Weaving's delivery. This villain has much to say about the human condition that both sums up his disgust of humanity and also the reason for the creation of The Matrix. Everytime Hugo Weaving was on the screen it made for an exciting moment as the audience would be getting a great action moment or a grand speech by the Agent of the system.I highly recommend 'The Matrix'.Grade: A",9,1,1,12 October 2019

The movie stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ken Watanabe, Bryan Cranston, and Elizabeth Olsen. A nuclear power plant suffers a catastrophic failure leading to several deaths in the power plant staff. A father and his son investigate and discover evidence of titanic monsters.Godzilla is a movie that one watches for the spectacle. The spectacle here is impressive to watch with every scene having an epic feeling. The movie is shot incredibly well. The only disadvantage to the movie is it may appear too dark. This was not a problem for me as the movie wanted to have an apocalyptic feeling. The CGI and effects still hold up even in the overly dark cinematography of the movie. Godzilla and the MUTOs are impressive to watch and they cause many grand scenes to appear. Even the introduction of the military in observing the creatures is incredibly well done.What separates this Godzilla movie from the 1998 Godzilla movie that was directed by Roland Emmerich is that this one focuses more on the human characters. The human characters have more important roles in this movie as they serve as gateways to the monsters and the audience's connection to them. Surprisingly they even help Godzilla deal with the threat of the MUTOs. It was important for the human characters to exist and they offer good characterization. Bryan Cranston delivers a great performance in this movie along with Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Elizabeth Olsen. The characters do not have deep characterization but they have enough to make the movie enjoyable.The sound in this movie is awe-inspiring. Every military vehicle has a great distinct sound. The monsters are also impressive to hear. This movie is best enjoyed with a grand sound system as the movie wants to immerse the audience in a great auditory experience.I would recommend Godzilla.Grade: B",8,0,1,17 August 2019

A farmer named Luke Skywalker rises to his destiny as he and a local hermit embark on an adventure when they find a droid.Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope is the classic hero's journey in a science-fiction form. This movie needs to be watched by anyone with even a passing interest in films. This film has the hero's journey packed in an incredibly accessible way. This film's plot is easy and engrossing to follow. The hero's journey of Luke Skywalker is reflected well in his characteristics and movie events. Luke Skywalker is one of the best heroic characters. Mark Hamill really made a name for himself by playing Luke Skywalker so convincingly. The rest of the cast does a great job. Harrison Ford plays Han Solo, a suave smuggler. Carrie Fisher plays Princess Leia of the Rebel Alliance.The special effects are not perfect but do a good job in telling a special story. It was cool to watch the special effects used to immerse the viewer into the Star Wars universe. Likewise the props, practical effects, and costumes are of good quality here. Part of what made the story so successful is its effective use of the effects that are present.I highly recommend Star Wars. Even with the later edits by George Lucas the movie continues to retain its magic and charm.Grade: A",8,1,1,14 October 2018

The movie stars Taika Waititi, Jemaine Clement, Jonathan Brugh, and Ben Fransham. The is about a documentary crew that follows four vampires inside of a house. The movie follows the four vampires as they have nightly adventures in Wellington, New Zealand.What We Do in the Shadows is an excellent comedy movie. The movie is similar to other mockumentaries such as The Office which follows the characters around. The vampire characters of Viago, Vladislav, Deacon, and Petyr are incredibly hilarious as they have many misadventures across Wellington. The movie does incredibly well in making the audience care about these characters and the events that occur to them. The movie does not have much a plot much like other mockumentaries and instead has the audience become invested in the characters to tell the story.The characters are easily the best part of this movie. The side characters and main characters are all played well by the actors and actresses and they have great moments. One of the characters, Nick, is inadvertently turned into a vampire and becomes a character the audience can use to follow how the vampires undergo their rituals. This moment is incredibly funny as Nick has to explore vampirism. In addition, the usage of the vampire powers is played to great comedic effect as the movie plays up the ignorance of humans.The primary problem with the movie is that overall it does meander. There is no grand story arc in this movie. The movie feels more like an elevated television show however this is not a detractment if the audience knows what they want. The trailers for this movie were not misleading and never hinted at a large story. The movie is a simple story focusing on the vampiric characters.I would recommend 'What We Do in the Shadows'. This is an excellent movie with great casting and timing on the comedic sequences.Grade: B",8,1,1,25 April 2020

It follows his origins and subsequent revenge on the group that wronged him. Along the way, a pair of X-Men try to redeem Deadpool.Deadpool retains its comic book charm and violence in this live-action adaptation. The movie has Deadpool constantly making jokes even when the subject manner gets darker. The movie makes light of many dark situations such as horrendous disfiguring that brings the movie back into a lighter tone. Since this movie is an origin story, much of Deadpool's backstory is told here. However, his story is not fully complete as the X-Men acquaintances, the Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead are not explained fully. The plot is incredibly basic as it is a simple revenge story that is told through flashbacks.Even with its basic plot, the story has some highlights in the way it is paced. With humor, and wit the story remains engaging. The true highlights in the movie are its action sequences. The action in this movie is well shot and well performed. The effects and sets are well detailed. It is easy to watch the movie solely for its action scenes to fill the price of admission.It is easy to recommend Deadpool to anyone looking for witty dialogue and entertaining action.

The movie is directed by Chad Stahelski, produced by Basil Iwanyk, and Erica Lee, written by Derek Kolstad, and stars Keanu Reeves. The movie takes place a few days after the end of John Wick and continues following the story.John Wick: Chapter 2 is a strong follow-up to the first John Wick movie. There is more of the same awesome set-pieces and action moments in this movie that were present in the first movie. The pieces are overall improved and even nicer to look at from a production view. The movie is also much better directed than the first movie with the movie being gorgeous to see during the set pieces. If audiences watch John Wick: Chapter 2 for only the action, they will be excited to see how every single action scene plays out.The sequel is also much improved on the story and world. The second chapter in the John Wick franchise actually expands more on the culture and world of the assassins. The traditions that were discovered by the audience in the first movie continue here and overall it creates a consistent experience for the viewer. This world does come into play in this movie and it forces John Wick to act. One of the ways the movie is propelled by Santino D'Antonio utilizing a blood marker to get John Wick back into the game. This puts the entire events of the movie into motion as John Wick is forced to execute Santino's orders until the blood marker is fulfilled.John Wick: Chapter 2's faults may lie entirely in its plot. John Wick is forced to act completely at the whim of Santino D'Antonio. The plot can feel incredibly forced after the ending of John Wick since the story only continues without any lingering plot threads. Chapter 2 has enough to get people interested in the world to be interested in the movie. There is more mention of the assassin's organization and how deep the entire organization goes. The movie does get more unbelievable towards the end when John Wick becomes excommunicated. John Wick is suddenly surrounded by assassins that want his contract. The ending is a grand spectacle, but it seems unlikely that so many people are assassins.I would recommend 'John Wick: Chapter 2'. The movie is a solid follow-up to John Wick.Grade: B",7,0,0,14 December 2019

Incredibles 2," Exciting and riveting but not as fresh
","This review contains spoilers.Incredibles 2 is the sequel to 2004's The Incredibles. The movie is directed by Brad Bird and stars the same main cast as the first movie. The movie picks up where The Incredibles left off with the Underminer robbing a bank, and the Parr family trying to stop him.The Incredibles 2 is a great family movie that is fun and engaging for all audiences. Every frame and second of the movie is well animated and has great sound effects that the audiences has come to expect from Pixar. A warning for some audiences is that the movie should have a seizure warning as some scenes have rapid strobe lights.The voice actors all do a great job. Samuel L. Jackson reprises his role as Frozone. Holly Hunter continues as Elastigirl. Craig T. Nelson is Mr. Incredible. Bob Odenkirk plays a superhero fan in Winston Deavor. There is not a weak link in the voice acting ensemble for this movie.The plot however is the weak point and it felt obvious that something else was going on in Winston Deavor's company. Like the movie before it, this sequel re-uses that same twist that happened with Syndrome but with different reasons. Evelyn Deavor wants to be rid of superheroes so she creates the screenslaver to discredit superheroes forever. This felt strange as much of the conflict was created by Evelyn. When Winston wanted to improve superhero relations, he looked for big targets that would be hit. These targets were actually created by Evelyn. It seemed that her plan would have been fine if the screenslaver never existed. Superheroes are not needed to stop normal crime.The other problem in the story is the Underminer not being referenced again. After the opening sequence, the Underminer disappears and is never apprehended. I had imagined that the Underminer would play a bigger role in the sequel and this is not the case.Overall, I would recommend the Incredibles 2. The movie is a solid animated summer action movie.Grade: B",8,1,2,14 July 2018
Windtalkers," A fun but historically inaccurate movie
","This review contains spoilers.Windtalkers is an action movie that premiered in 2002. The movie is directed by John Woo and stars Nicolas Cage, and Adam Beach. The movie is inspired by Navajo code breakers on the
Pacific theater for the United States military. The movie follows two USMC Soldiers in the invasion of Saipan.Windtalkers is a movie with a lot of problems. This movie is not historically accurate. I would treat this movie as freely influenced by real events. Much of this movie simply uses real events however it likes for its own benefit. This makes the movie feel contrived as so much of the movie felt like a Hollywood action movie. To some audiences, this is perfectly acceptable.The movie follows two soldiers: Sergeant Joe Enders, played by Nicolas Cage, and Private Ben Yahzee, played by Adam Beach. These two soldiers are the protagonists in this movie but do not undergo a satisfying story. Much of this story felt contrived and their character interactions artificial. The dialogue felt so artificial and forced. Each of these characters have backstories that are simply given to the characters and not explored thoroughly. This makes the plot and characters in this move incredibly weak.The movie does do its action well. John Woo can direct adrenaline pumping action scenes that dazzle the audience. This movie is filled with these scenes. These action scenes make the movie worth watching but are not particularly memorable. These action scenes are not like the fun ballet of bullets from John Woo's Hard Boiled movie and instead are more grounded in reality.Nicolas Cage does deliver a classic Nicolas Cage acting moment here. He is more restricted in his role here but he does have insane freak out moments. Nicolas Cage makes this movie entertaining to watch.I would still recommend Windtalkers despite its obvious flaws. It is an entertaining movie that only uses history as a setting.Grade: C",6,1,1,2 December 2018
Spectre," Beautiful but hollow
","This review contains spoilers.Spectre is an action spy movie that premiered in 2015. The movie is directed by Sam Mendes who had directed Skyfall, the previous installment. The movie is based on James Bond by Ian Fleming. The movie stars Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz and Léa Seydoux. James Bond is pitted against the Spectre Organization which is revealed to have been responsible for the events of Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall. James Bond must thwart the leader of Spectre in Ernst Stavro Blofeld played by Christoph Waltz.Spectre is a beautiful movie with exciting action scenes. The movie is well shot much like the previous Bond movie of Skyfall. The movie has amazing action set pieces that are both exciting and impressive to watch. Spectre has a great ability to convey tension to the screen with a few key visuals. The direction from Sam Mendes starts impressively and continues across the 140 minute running time. The James Bond movies always have an impressive opening scene and Spectre is no exception.This opening scene is one of the most impressive opening scenes in the recent James Bond movies. The editing and direction flow incredibly well as James Bond is thwarting a terrorist plot in Mexico city during the Day of the Dead. This opening scene is one of my favorites across the James Bond movies that I have watched. The editing, and direction does continue into the running time and is an absolute positive for this movie.Spectre's problems are however numerous. This movie is not well written. The movie felt like a mix between Quantum of Solace and Skyfall. The villain in Ernst Stavro Blofeld is similar to Raoul Silva from Skyfall. The villain has an intricate and well thought out plan with loads of resources. The plan is revenge against James Bond and MI6. The Quantum of Solace writing style seems that to have re-emerged in this movie. There is so much bloat in this movie. It seemed as if the movie tried to both play it safe and take risks which lead to an inconsistent tone. There are so many plot points that the viewers simply have to accept. This movie throws these plot points in to be accepted by the fans of previous movies. I felt that this did taint the older movies rather than offer a new way of looking at the older movies. I felt that the older movies were better off at feeling more stand-alone rather than being forced to tie in a long story arc across multiple movies. This made the movie of Spectre feel less impactful than it should have been. The grand reveal that both James Bond and Ernst Stavro Blofeld shared a common childhood felt incredibly hollow. None of the earlier James Bond's had even hinted at this. This is absolutely an aspect that could have been improved upon to help the story, but it required more of a setup across the earlier Bond films.The acting in this movie is solid. The three leads in Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, and Léa Seydoux do a capable job. I enjoyed Christoph Waltz's performance even though I did not enjoy his character. Christoph is able to portray a great screen presence even when his character is not well written Likewise Léa Seydoux and Daniel Craig do a good job in their roles. It would have been better to see more from Léa Seydoux's character of Dr. Madeleine Swann, who is not introduced until the movie is already well underway.Spectre is not recommended. The movie has enough to satisfy action junkies but anyone looking to a conclusion to Bond's story are started in Casino Royale will be disappointed.Grade: D",5,0,3,9 March 2019
Hacksaw Ridge," Enthralling war story
","This review contains spoilers.Hacksaw Ridge is directed by Mel Gibson and stars Andrew Garfield. Andrew Garfield plays Desmond Doss as a pacifist Marine medic in the Pacific Theater of World War 2. The story completely follows Desmond Doss' story as a teenager to the Battle of Okinawa.Hacksaw Ridge creates a compelling story for the audience to follow. Andrew Garfield plays Desmond Doss magnificently. As a character that abstains from violence, Andrew Garfield displays that division in Desmond Doss well. The story also gives hints to the damage The Great War had done to Desmond Doss' father played by Hugo Weaving. Its scenes such as these that elevate the movie above being a typical war movie. The division between Doss and the rest of the marines in boot-camp is interesting to watch. One could understand why the marines believed Doss to be dead-weight in the company. It was relieving to watch them realize that courage takes many forms than only active battle.The war scenes in the movie do not hold much back. This movie absolutely earns its R rating with the high level of violence depicted in the Battle of Okinawa. Many of the brutal Japanese tactics can be seen in the movie with the directing capturing a lot of the terrible deaths in the movie. The movie's gore can be too much to handle for some but anyone looking for an authentic depiction should watch this movie.There are some strange choices in this movie with the reason I am speculating to help the narrative. During boot-camp, the drill sergeant is one of Doss' critics. It seemed that he would only be a drill instructor, but he joins the men in battle which does not appear to make sense. I thought military drill instructors do not join the troops into battle.The movie in general is well directed and well edited. The movie uses its effects with great use in how many scenes the audience cannot tell immediately that it is computer generated.Overall Hacksaw Ridge is not only a good war movie, but a great movie. One should watch it to appreciate the real life story of Desmond Doss.Grade: B",8,1,1,17 May 2018
The Social Network," Embellished and solid movie
","This review contains spoilers.The Social Network is a biographical drama movie that premiered in 2010. The movie is directed by David Fincher. The movie is based on the book 'The Accidental Billionaires' by Ben Mezrich. The movie stars Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield. The movie is about the founding of Facebook and the subsequent lawsuits concerning the creation of Facebook.David Fincher does an excellent job directing this movie. This is a solid movie that can embellish the truth of the founding of Facebook. It is a movie that absolutely does well in the presentation of the real-life events. 'The Social Network' is able to make the world revolves around Mark Zuckerberg and his executives feel incredibly real and authentic. This ability to craft the narrative to make the audience both sympathize and also despise the Facebook executives is a job well done by David Fincher. In addition the movie is well shot, edited, and staged. This is a great movie in the presentation. If you were to watch this for its presentation alone, the grade would be an A.The acting by all of the stars are phenomenal. Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg does a great job in this role. I enjoyed his portrayal of the controversial Facebook founder. It makes for an interesting depiction of the founder, when the actor is able to show more emotion than their real-life counterpart. Likewise Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin does a good job. Although I do not see much of a resemblance to the real life counterpart, Andrew Garfield is able to portray the betrayal he suffers at the hands of Mark Zuckerberg with great conviction. It makes the earlier parts of the movie where they partnered harder to watch. Even many of the smaller supporting cast members do an admirable job in this movie.The movie does embellish the truth which can make this appear to be a fatal flaw to some audiences. For most of them, the audience can accept this as a well told story. As with many biographical movies, the movie has to embellish the truth to be more satisfying narratively. The movie does feed into the negative opinion of Mark Zuckerberg which can be warranted depending on one's views.I would recommend 'The Social Network.'Grade: B",9,1,1,15 June 2019
Goodfellas," Snazzy and well directed gangster movie
","This review contains spoilers.Goodfellas premiered in 1990. The movie is directed by Martin Scorcese and stars Ray Liotta Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci. The movie follows three men in the criminal underworld that they want to ascend. The movie follows these three characters as they traverse the criminal world across the 145 minutes of running time.Goodfellas is a masterpiece movie by Martin Scorcese. The movie is incredibly well directed. Martin Scorcese should deserve a lot of accolades for directing this movie so well. Every scene in this movie has a nice rewatchability to it. These scenes take on a new meaning on multiple watches. This is also helped by the highly energetic style of the directing. The entire movie moves at a fast pace and there is never a dull moment. Even the scenes that are more on the quiet side are directed in an interesting way to bring out the best in the actors.The three main leads in Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci do a phenomenal job in this movie. Ray Liotta plays Henry Hill as he climbs the ladder of the mafia. It is fun to watch Henry as he lives a criminal life and interacts with characters played by the other two leads. Every scene that has any of these leads is well-acted and directed. Joe Pesci plays a hot-headed mobster in Tommy DeVito. This character is incredibly memorable. Joe Pesci absolutely puts in a performance of a lifetime into the character of Tommy DeVito.The story in this movie is rather simple to follow and has many fun twists. The entire movie is narrated by Henry Hill and incredibly well edited As said before, this is a movie that does not have a dull moment. Much of this is owed to the editing, directing, and acting. The story has no problems showing loads of gore and unpleasant scenes to the audience. This is expected from looking into a mobster's life. The movie does not only focus on crime. It also focuses on the home life between Henry and Karen. This drama that arises from the life of crime is engrossing to watch.I highly recommend Goodfellas.Grade: A",9,0,0,24 November 2018
Alien: Covenant," Disappointing
","This review contains spoilers.Alien: Covenant is the indirect sequel to Prometheus and is directed by Ridley Scott. It stars Katherine Waterston, Danny McBride, and Michael Fassbender. The story focuses on a crew that discovers the Engineer's homeworld as they explore it to check its habitability. On the way, they discover David from the Prometheus crew.First and foremost, the writing in this movie is significantly worse than its predecessor, Prometheus. Characters will do seemingly nonsensical actions that ultimately cause their deaths. It is as if the characters are written with their death scenes in mind first rather than having a backstory and character motivations. Characters are also aware of how dangerous the planet is, and they still endanger themselves and others by not doing anything sensible. One of the characters believes someone might be infected and upon receiving blood to her face, quarantines the others even when she may be infected as well. This action leads to her death in a rather ridiculous way. Another instance is the captain willingly following David even when he has shown to have ulterior motives into his laboratory. The captain is not surprisingly killed in a way any horror movie viewer can expect.The movie sets out to destroy any remnants of its prequel, Prometheus through Shaw's off screen death. What was Prometheus' more interesting character with an character and story arc setup is discarded for action and nonsensical deaths. I was looking forward to a continuation of the story and that is not found here.The directing and acting are decent enough for a full watch. However, the character actions are enough to be angry at this movie's use of actors. This movie could and should have been rewritten as the main story arc has now changed to David creating the xenomorphs.I do not recommend Alien: Covenant.Grade: D",6,1,1,20 June 2020
