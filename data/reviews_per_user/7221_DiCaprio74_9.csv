The Blair Witch Project," No.
","I feel as though this movie had gotten gassed too much. Yes, it was one of the first documentary style horror films that was evolving around the supernatural beings. However, it was also one of the worst. The acting in this was simply annoying. I understand that it was supposed to be some type of found footage of some sort and as though they all disappeared and some hikers found this tape and decided to edit it and put it out to the public, but it was trying too hard to focus on them being themselves that there was no type of acting ability within it at all. This movie was only given a 5/10 solely because it was the first of its kind. Yet, everything else about this film, was not as good as everyone had claimed it to be. In my opinion, if you would like to see where all of the present day 'documentary style footage' originated, I would watch this film just to get some history down packed. But, if you're watching this movie just to watch a movie, I wouldn't recommend this one. Unless you're up for a supposed 'scary' movie with horrible acting.",5,0,5,28 May 2015
Lone Survivor," Intense and Touching
","Phenomenal! That's one of the many words to explain this movie. Based on a true story, which is the saddest part of this film. The audience already knows what the inevitable ending will be because of the title. The characters were spot on. The Navy Seals: Wahlberg, Kitsch, Hirsch and Foster played their roles brilliantly. They acted so well that it seemed as if they were actually there, experiencing the action head on in real life. They all play their roles very carefully. Knowing that they have to play someone who was real and endured all of those events. Although Wahlberg was the lead, Kitsch took all of the stardom from playing the fearless captain.Although outnumbered by Taliban forces, the men put up a tough fight, all the way through to the end... Well of their lives. They all died with honor. The shootout sequence was filled with brutality, gore and heartbreaking scenes. It had the audience at the edge of their seat. Made them feel as if they could feel their pain through the screen. By the end of the film, it makes you appreciate not only the Navy Seals, but the other military people who are out there risking their lives as we sit here and not think anything about them. This was a heart racing film that will have an everlasting effect on myself personally. When the pictorial came at the end of the movie, it kind of brought the audience back to reality. To let them know that these men were real, they had families too, and they risked their lives to save their fellow Seals.",8,0,1,9 July 2014
World War Z," New Unrated Cut
","I watched the New Unrated Cut version of this movie and it was really good. I was shocked at how many negative reviews it got, which was simply because most people watched the regular version. The Unrated version had a better explanation in the end and it wasn't futile like the one that came out in theaters. On the other hand, Brad Pitt did a good job, as usual, in this film. Although I was kind of lost to how you could get infected by a bite (normal), but if it gets into your mouth, you're fine. I mean, I know it was rabies, but still. Right? Also, I didn't understand how there was already a lot of noise being made in the inner city: Buses coming in and out, helicopters flying around, police cars etc... But it was the singing that made the zombies go even crazier an build a ladder like wall to cross over? It was a good movie, don't get me wrong, I just think that it could've been thought about more carefully and re-edited. If you watch this movie, I'd recommend watching the Unrated Cut version. The story will probably make more sense, unlike the theatrical one which will probably leave you wanting your money back.",7,0,0,9 July 2014
Silver Linings Playbook," Hilarious Romance
","This movie was great. Great acting by Cooper, Lawrence, De Niro & even Tucker. O. Russell did a great job directing this movie.Pat & Tiffany are just two characters who the audience can find themselves attached to and can also learn a thing or two from. They are funny and relatable in more ways than one might think that they are. I've been seeing people say that it's a boring movie, but honestly, if you find the patience for it, you will eventually begin to understand the film. Along with if you've read and enjoyed the novel by Matthew Quick. Moving along, the performances of De Niro and Tucker were very realistic and attachable. Cooper & Lawrence did the most phenomenal jobs trying to beat one another in who is the most mental. Altogether this was an excellent film that I would recommend being watched by people of all ages. Although starting off slow in the beginning, it proved itself otherwise.",8,0,2,22 July 2015
The Hangover Part II," Not like the first
","This movie was still pretty hilarious although it was a completely different story plot with the same scenario from the first one. Bradley Cooper, in my opinion, can turn any movie around just from his acting skills. Galifianakis was his usual hilarious self along with Helms and Jeong. The only disappointment that had came out of the film was pretty much the fact that they had used the same scenario from the first Hangover movie. You would think that the director would like to go with a different type of storyline, but I guess this was the one that he was sticking to. Along with it being the easiest to come up with as well. This movie was more than the average comedy film that you would see, but it's lack of good story structure was an issue.  I'm not going to lie and say that I didn't laugh at this film, because I did, it's just that it could've went in another direction. It's claimed a movie that you either hate or love, but I simply find myself in the middle of not liking it because it really went nowhere, and loving it because it was hilarious. I would tell you to give it a try before continuing to read the rest of the reviewers ratings. Try it for yourself and find out how you like it before determining to stay away from it or not.",6,0,0,1 January 2015
The Silence of the Lambs," Remarkable
","Jonathan Demme is awesome. This movie is an outstanding, suspenseful thriller. It's a must see for people who love this genre. It's definitely a cult classic that will be added to my favorites. Jodie Foster as Starling and Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter. They both plays their parts really well. Lecter as the cannibalistic psychopath who slowly helps Foster try to find a serial killer who is skinning his victims and Foster as the FBI agent trying to solve the case. This film was a great one, it had it's extremely creepy moments, and left me wanting to watch it all over again. Must see this movie. It's one of those movies that gets even better as it progresses.",8,0,0,12 July 2014
Casino," Scorsese the Legend
","This man is one of the best directors around! His work is phenomenal, and his choice in characters is illustrious. Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone, and Joe Pesci were extraordinary ! They played their parts so well. I've seen this film numerous times, I've lost count years ago! It's a must see film for mafia/gangster movie fans! Martin Scorsese did it once again, I loved GoodFellas and Taxi Driver just as much as I loved this movie. He is an amazing director who should be awarded for every movie he made. He's that good at what he does. It's sad to see that Pesci is no longer acting because he was really good at playing these roles. God Bless Martin Scorcese!",9,1,2,10 July 2014
Gangs of New York," God Bless Scorcese !
","This movie was spectacular! The casting was amazing! Me being a huge Leonardo DiCaprio fan, thought that he was a brilliant cast for Amsterdam Vallon, Day-Lewis played the notorious Bill the Butcher and did a phenomenal job and lastly Cameron Diaz showed how she can play in movies that are much more than just standard romantic comedies. The violence and gore was prodigious, and although shy of three hours long, it will keep you interested. It was all, for the most part, pretty accurate. There were a few anachronisms, but what historical movie doesn't have any? In conclusion, Martin Scorcese once again did an amazing job. He is one of my favorite directors, and definitely think that he should've gotten an Oscar for this amazing piece of art !",8,0,0,8 July 2014
Goodfellas," God Bless Martin Scorsese
","This movie was phenomenal! All of the lead roles were superb! Liotta, De Niro, Sorvino, Pesci & Bracco. Scorsese couldn't have chosen a better cast.  Ray Liotta played the Henry Hill perfectly, there couldn't have been anyone else better to play him. De Niro did another great mafia performance since The Untouchables and Pesci fit the role perfectly as Tommy, the wild guy with serious mental issues. Scorsese is a phenomenal director and his work here is outstanding. He should've gotten the award for Beat Director in this film, sadly he didn't. No other director can pull off a movie as good as this one. Overall, this movie is a must see cult-classic that ages like good scotch. It gets better as it gets older! It is one of the greatest true story films told on screen and is a definite must see movie!",9,0,2,6 July 2014
