Catch Me If You Can," Possibly the most underrated film of all-time
","Spielberg is regarded by many as the greatest director of all-time by many, with the examples of Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan and Jurassic Park just being a taster of his remarkable work. But for me, his greatest achievement is the incredibly underrated masterpiece that is Catch Me If You Can. Sure it didn't win Oscars ( but it was was nominated), sure it wasn't a box office smash, sure it didn't show us the horrors of the past, but it did show us a heartbreaking REAL story, of a boy who couldn't take his parents divorce, who wanted to run away with it all, and frauded the USA out of millions of dollars, being chased along the way, baffling the FBI and the world as to how he could obtain the money, fool the professionals and simply get away with his continuous law-breaking.Leonardo DiCaprio, who is regularly snubbed in acting, probably because of his outrageous good looks, is the best actor of his generation, without a doubt. His performances in Romeo & Juliet, Titanic, The Man In The Iron Mask, Gangs of New York, are all top-notch, exceptional roles that put many of today's actors to shame. Catch Me If You Can is by far his best performance.He plays the fraud Frank Abagnale Jr with such depth and realism that you feel almost intrusive on his life, like you know too much about him. We witness his confusion at the divorce, his disgust at his mother's new boyfriend, his despair at not having a proper home anymore. And yet Leo also plays the adventurous teen spot on when it comes to a certain arrogance needed to convince people he's a pilot or a doctor. Also the determination and focus to detail on Leo's face when making fraudulent cheques, degrees etc is quite unbelievable, you really feel that this kid is putting his utmost concentration into these scams because it's his only way to survive, and he's gotta keep on running or he'll go to prison. Tom Hanks, as always is on top form as a fast-talking FBI agent who lives and breathes his job, and who is on Leo's trail. Understanding of the young kids' obvious trauma at the divorce, Hanks does sympathise, but has to chase him because, as he puts it 'it's my job'.The chemistry between both Leo and Hanks is very enjoyable, for although they are almost enemies with one chasing the other, in the end they turn out to be the best of friends. The most intriguing and unique relationship in the film though has to go to Leo and his father Frank Abagnale Sr. played by the eternally mesmerising Christopher Walken. Walken's character is a man who is very proud and when he is in economic ruin he tries to fool everyone into thinking he's the successful man, however the only person he is fooling is himself. He convinces himself totally that lying makes everything better, and this is probably where Frank is inspired to run away from everything and lie his way around the world. It certainly is the case when Leo asks Walken to tell him to stop running, and instead encouraging him to stop, Walken says 'You cant stop' and then carries on the web of lies his son has spun by asking ' Where are you going tonight? Somewhere exotic?' referring to Leo's stunt as a pilot. Walken was deservedly Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his performance which is really quite fascinating. The most memorable and poignant scene of the film is where Leo learns from Hanks that his father ( Walken) died by slipping on stairs. This is where Leo's talent is really shown, as the pain and anguish fill his eyes in a mixture of disbelief, anger, helplessness, plus feeling physically sick. He slams the chair in front of him, his eyes swollen in tears. But it's just his moans, eyes or facial expression that makes us feel his huge loss, it is his body. Leo's body moves in the strangest ways, almost like he is consumed with grief and reaching out in despair, all in all making it quite hard to watch. I haven't seen anyone put across that kind of emotion since the great James Dean in the 1950's. Along with the fast pace, great songs from 1950/60's, the atmosphere of that time gone by, a hell of a cast (including brief performances by Martin Sheen and Jennifer Garner), Catch Me If You Can is highly entertaining. Boasting a highly unique soundtrack, a truly uplifting storyline, world-class acting and some superb direction, Catch Me If You Can is Spielberg's most underrated and yet best work, and is a film that will become a firm favourite with all who view it.",10,0,3,13 June 2009
La Vie En Rose," mesmerising!!!!!!!!!!!!
","When I watched Marion Cotillard take on the role of the great Edith Piaf, I didn't expect to be as astounded as I was. The performance was mesmerising- so strong, powerful, emotional and convincing. Along with Brando as Don Corleone, Bogie as Sam Spade and Bette Davis as Margot Channing, I believe that Cotillard as Edith Piaf has become one of the greatest performances seen on the screen.The setting and atmosphere are so authentic, the music so beautiful and the actors so real. Depardieu and the rest of the cast do french cinema so much justice. The cast and direction, cinematography and music make the film over all brilliant.Although all the elements in the film are tremendous, it is Cotillard who steals the show with her spell-binding performance that deservedly won the Best Actress Oscar. Like in 'Walk The Line' with Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon giving breathtaking warmth to the roles of music legends Johnny Cash and June Carter, 'La Vie En Rose' has done exactly the same. Revealing Piaf's amazing life without being disrespectful.Incredibly moving and entertaining - definitely one to watch. The best film of the year!",9,1,3,19 May 2008
Pocahontas," Brilliant for kids, hilarious for adults!!! A MUST-SEE!!
","You can see Pocahontas from many sides. For kids you can enjoy the animals being silly and the cheesy dialogue, as a child is fun all the way. However for an adult, you can also see it as educative not historically, but in the lessons of prejudice and violence. The critics who say the film is racist are idiots, because the film favours both races, as both don't want to fight except for one or two individuals which represent those in society who try to disrupt peace. The way i viewed was that it is a very funny film, and i think all adults will be humoured by the way John Smith is supposed to be good looking and his macho-arrogance. Also the way Pocahontas is the only attractive girl Captain Radcliffe.Don't sit to watch this film expecting a historical account of the English colonising America, watch it a for a barrel of laughs and Disney does not disappoint!So! The film stars very cleverly with a 19600 style painting which turns into a real scene of a ship setting sail for the new world, accompanied by a simple song which sets the tone of the period. Here we meet the villain Radcliffe and the hero John Smith ( voiced brilliantly by Mel Gibson). Already you will laugh at the way Smith effortlessly swings around on the ship ropes with total ease and showing off his strength. But wait it gets funnier, the ship gets caught in a storm half way across the Atlantic, and the weakest sailor Tom ( voiced by Batman Christian Bale) falls overboard. And who saves the day? JOHN SMITH! Yes the hunk himself dives miles into the sky, plunging into an angry ocean of epic waves, and saves pathetic Tom!! I know it isn't supposed to be realistic, but you've gotta laugh. Plus Smith's mane blonde hair that looks like a dodgy wig and penetrating blue eyes, ( clearly trying to go for the Paul Newman good looks here). Nevertheless an action packed start!This is where the genius of Disney's animators, editors and composer ( Alan Menken) come through, for after the horrendous noise of the storm and the dramatic saving of Tom, it all disappears into a fog, silence, the fog lifts to reveal a calm, warm shore with still blue waters and tall green trees, accompanied by a slow beating drum ( mystery as to what lurks on this land). Then comes a choir of tribes people singing a tribal song. We are immediately now transported from the greys, and the noise of the modern world, to the vibrant colours and tranquility of the undiscovered world. From here on, the film is a real credit to it's makers.Pocahontas is a beautiful woman, with long jet black hair, a gazelle-like figure, and a good spirit. You immediately like her not just because of her beauty but at her determination to improve relations between both worlds. What she sees in John Smith, lord knows lol!! John Smith is totally mesmerised by the dark beauty, and though at first we may not like him, his love for Pocahontas changes our minds. Other characters like Powhatan, Grand mother Willow, Nikoma and the animals all add a depth to the story and really contribute to an atmosphere of spirits ( Pocahontas' mother in the movie is actually the wind). The star of this movie however is without a doubt the score composed by the ever-so talented Alan Menken. Songs like ' Just Around the Riverbend' and 'Colours of the Wind' are worthy of any other great Disney song, and 'Savages' is an intense number, which shows the collision of two hates, with flame and smoke symbolising warfare, and the end of the new world with the colonisation of the modern world. The best song in the movie is the one played during the End Cred its, 'If I Never Knew You', a truly beautiful love song that captures the essence of the film and the love between Poc and Smith. All in all, this is a very underrated movie, one of Disney's finest, with a good moral message in it as well, it is a must-see for all children out there. As for us adults, it's educative to us too, but more so, it makes you giggle. WATCH OUT! The Special Edition DVD almost ruins the film, as they integrate the song If I Never Knew You into the film. Unlike with Beauty and the Beast where they composed a completely new scene, animators put it into two very intense. moving and important scenes. Both where Pocahontas speaks to Smith in the tent where he is imprisoned, and her final farewell to him at the end of the film, have them both singing this song. It overcheeses the love ridiculously, and to have Smith singing '... I'd have lived my whole life throoooooooooough', with this never ending note, when he is practically dying of a gun-shot wound is just stupid and ruins it for all of us who love the original.So I advice to buy the one-disc DVD with the original, and not the two-disc special edition which ruins the movie.",10,2,4,13 June 2009
Atonement," Outstanding!
","Atonement is the best romantic film that cinema has seen in a long time. It contains everything needed for a romance to tug at our heartstrings.The British press gave Keira Knightley a lot of credit and were outraged when she didn't receive an Oscar-nomination or a Bafta Award. She is a brilliant actress, stunning in that classical look and I believe the biggest acting sensation since Meryl Streep. However, her performance as Cecilia in Atonement isn't a very large one and therefore I agree and think that the awards went to better performances. The star of the film is without a doubt James McAvoy. His performance reduces you to tears as he is sent to fight in the war. Critics should have made a fuss about him not receiving an Oscar-nomination. He's definitely the best British acting sensation so far and is seriously underrated. His performance is breathtaking.The music is beautiful and goes perfectly with the story. It is original and one of the best.Overall, Atonement is a must see! The cast are brilliant, the music is wonderful-and the story is heartbreaking.",10,4,6,19 May 2008
