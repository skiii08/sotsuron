The Blair Witch Project," Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr......
","This movie alone surpasses all the 'hellraisers-exorcists-omens-draculas-and-all-kinda-scary-horror-stuff' compressed together in one mixture of scary emotions. That's because it REALLY can happen to u... No weirdo characters, or funny looking monsters... Just the noise of reality in a dark wood... But one thing though... Why the hell haven't they followed the f*** river? why? :o) It would have been perfect to my opinion if they just followed this river, and fallen into this 'circle' along with the river... Besides that, it's really new, and gutsy. And beautiful!",Null,0,1,7 February 2000
54," Nice
","After Austin Powers, Mike Myers shows another face, quite different from the dumb human being who gets all the hot chicks: he's a nightclub owner, where only stars, and 'star-looking' people can go in, and live a fantasy for all the senses, where god is concretized by music, cocaine, extasy, sex, and all kind of drugs..... Dream of fame, but it's not always THAT cool..... And Neve Campbell IS very beautiful!",Null,0,0,22 May 1999
The Piano," Can we REALLY talk with our hands?
","Ada, is a very beautiful woman, but she can't talk... her language is the music (great piano in the soundtrack), and her deepest emotions, her whole soul just escapes from her fingers, through the piano chords. Another hands and touch language is brought to our eyes by Harvey Keitel, not on piano keys, but on human flesh! The scenario could be bypassed, music and fingers shows it all. And the landscapes! They are through the story, a perfect representation of Ada's feelings! Beautiful!",Null,0,2,19 May 1999
