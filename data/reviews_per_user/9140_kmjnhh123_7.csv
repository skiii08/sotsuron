Hereditary," Typical Hype Trash
","I normally don't watch horror films because i generally don't find them scary or really interesting, but i thought i'd give this a go.Well, nothing literally happens till the end, theres the odd 30 second scary bit here and there till the end where they end up doing some weird cult thing... thats the film, the rest of the film is talking... mindless boring irrelevent talking.Nothing more to say apart from i understand there is a book that references the film, yea okay, film is still trash.Age: 25 - Cinema: Cineworld Milton Keynes 2D Normal Screen, Unlimited Card

Avengers: Endgame," We Waited All These Years For This!
","Okay so I've loved most of the Marvel films leading up to this final phase, great, i loved Infinity War.So watching this film for the first time was okay, because the old characters coming back and so on is cool once only, after watching the film again i was really bored, like really bored until the end fight.So for me this film was literally 2 hours and 30 mins of talking and stumbling around not doing much then followed by a Infinity War style fight scene which yes was cool but nothing special for the end of this phase.But the main point i want to get across is how much was wrong with this film, there is so many things wrong, I'm not gonna sit here and type 10,000 words to bore you with so all i say is go onto YouTube or Google and lookup 'Things wrong with End Game' and i guarantee you will change your mind about this film, you will reliase that not much makes sense and you will then be sad that this film was the end.Even my friends thought it was good at first, they gave it a 10/10 but after they picked the film apart they even saw how bad it really is.Age 25 - Cinema: Stevenage iMAX 3D Double Bill Infinity War + End Game

1917," Your Next 'Everything' Is Uncertain
","This is one of those war films that is truly different from the others, having watched JoJo Rabbit the other day & then watching 1917, it totally changes your view on what war films can or cant be about, where as JoJo Rabbit had comedy in it along with some dark moments, 1917 was all grit & dark from the get go. The film is visually & musically simple but simple in a way that is really good at portraying war in a dark way, theres no crazy upbeat music, theres no cool camera angels or slo mo to change the picture, the way the film was made to look like it was done in one shot is really smart & cool, because it follows the soldiers every move while panning through the various trenches, looking past everyone that is there, waiting for a attack, waiting for next orders, everyone just waiting for that next uncertain move & that is what gives the picture such a beautiful presence. throughout the film. The camera work is spot on at showing the surrounding effects war has had on the land, whether its panning in on people buried under mud that have died, or birds pecking at a corpse or even the ton of barbed wire that is blocking the way with dead people stuck in them, or just the insane amount of mud. It's really obvious where they had to cut the film in places for obvious reasons but that doesn't matter.The film its self is based on a true story which is incredible that the message actually got through to the other regiment to stop the attack to save countless lives, it just proves how important & vital things were back then & how anything & everything was set out to stop the message being delivered yet some how, with everything in the way & all the chances they could of died along the way, they managed to succeed, along with this & all the other messages that are sent in the war, it makes you really think that how on earth did they do it.The film really does keep you on edge throughout the whole film because it keeps saying to you that every move is uncertain, you are literally wanting them to win & stay alive. At one point a nazi plane gets shot down & crash lands near the protagonists, then they proceed to help the nazi solider get out of the plane but you know what is going to happen, it blatantly shows a knife on the nazi solider & that he going to stab the English soldiers, i literally sighed & shook my head because it was so obvious that one of the English soldiers was going to die, now yes that may be the real part of the story but in normal films its normally a cheap way to get rid of someone so it kinda bugged me but it was real so whatever.Overall though it is a brilliant film & 100% worth watching & also do watch in 2D iMAX because the picture is way more filling that what it would be on a normal size cinema screen so it can give you the most effect while watching the film.Age - 25

Joker," The Performance Is Not Joking
","This film is NOT a action film or a crazy live action shooter by any means, this film is about great acting and really has a deep message in the film which you have got to understand when watching this film, myself to while watching the film thought, ahh this is defiantly not going to be a action film so i was prepared to sit and study the Jokers performance and look inside him and feel what he was feeling and once you realised what he was going through and what his state his mind was in, then you started to appreciate what this film is about.But as far the film goes its self, well it wasn't great, I'm just not a fan of talking films normally but i just really understood Joaquin Phoenix's performance and that's why i give this film a generous 7.Also it would be really weird going from this Joker to the Dark Night Joker, the Dark Night Joker is just so different to this Joker, but both brilliant in their own ways i think.I was going to see this in iMAX 2D but decided not to in the end and tbh your not missing anything out so just watch this in normal showings.Age: 25 - Cinema: Cineworld Milton Keynes 2D Normal Unlimited Card

It Chapter Two," Flashback Galore
","Okay so I loved the first film, i gave it a 10/10. I'm not normally into horror films because of the generic jump scares and so on but IT is exception.So to bascially sum up chapter 2, well it plays a lot on the first film, i would say a good 1 hour & 30 mins are just flashbacks to the first film, yes they are revelent scenes to get their items that they need to sacrifice to do the ritual. BUT that does not make a good movie imo, because in between the almost 3 hour run time, you get Pennywise kinda scaring the cast here & there, the scary things that appear this time are more funny than scary according to everyone in the cinema I was in at the time.Then towards the end we are greeted with Pennywise's 'real' form, some spider looking thing which wasn't really gripping imo, but the way they defeated Pennywise was interesting, ill leave that spoiler out :)Yes there is still a great sense of humour in the film which I think we all love, the banter is still there from all the cast. BUT I do prefer them as a young cast personally, I think it just worked better BUT I understand that the films followed the books so I can't really moan about that.All in all i understand some of my points might seem silly because they have to follow the books but hey, it's my view on this filmOverall though i would not watch this one again but have happily watched IT 1 numerous times now & still love it.Age: 25 - Cinema Saw: Cineworld Stevenage iMAX 2D - Cost: Unlimited Card",6,2,5,6 September 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Great Mix Of Funny & Serious
","So everyone is saying this is not a comedy film & it turns dark throughout the film which is correct, but it has a mix of both rather than one or the other, the thing is with the dark parts to the film it is deemed normal within the film as of course back then it was normal for Nazis so laugh at Jews, for example; one scene JoJo makes a book about Jews and how bad they are, but when the german guards come in to check the house for a Jew hiding in the house they come across the book & all the guards read it & laugh about that it is in the book, but of course to them that is normal back then & portrayed as normal which does make you think.But for the funny parts to the film they are in pockets throughout the film, Adolf (Played by Taika Waititi him self) as JoJo's imaginary friend is a great addition to the film as he pops up & does really funny things & says some funny things as well, but if it was nor for Adolf there would be far less funny parts which gets me onto my next point, apart from the Adolf parts there was not that much overall in the film, the beginning of the films starts off on a role with the comedy but then seems to fall flat through the mid section of the film which we (4 of us that watched it) ll said it felt flat & just talking & was a bit boring tbh, that's why i think without the funny parts the film would no where be as good hence why i didn't rate it that high.Overall it is defiantly a watch because either way its a different take on war style films but not being about all guns & blazing violence for once.Age - 25

Midway," Great Visuals & Gripping Story, Watch In iMAX
","I will start off by saying that the visuals & sounds are incredible on this movie, you have got to watch it in iMAX to appreciate the full meaning of the movie.The movie to most people might look like some talking followed by some flying around, but it is much more than that, you have got to realise what the film is telling you, people do not get that back then there was no internet or super computers to decode messages & transcripts, we solely relied on these brave people back then to decode these messages from the enemy & literally gamble our entire fleet of ships & planes on these messages, just let that sink in for a while, because of that the film keeps you really hooked when they are talking about where to attacked to guess where the enemy are going to attack next.Now the visuals / action part of the film is really well done, again just think what planes they are in, what equipment they have to hand, they had to win no matter what, the scale of the ships & the planes are superb, especially when it shows the Japan flagship carrier, there is some great flying in the sky when they try to evade each other, the dive parts of the film are really epic, it shows a plane literally diving nose down to a enemy ship trying to get a bomb on them, a few times they miss & it literally makes you go 'Ahhhhh!', its got you on such a edge you are literally wanting them to win & cheer them on.Overall this is one of the better war films out there, good story & great visuals you cant go wrong.
