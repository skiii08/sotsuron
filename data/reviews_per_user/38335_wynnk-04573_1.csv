Child 44," Russia was that bad.
","For those who think this movie is just Russian bashing, itis not. The events surrounding the child killer was accurate, less children would have died at the hand of that filthy animal had they not 'pretended' serial killers did not exist in Russia, and it was far worse what he did to those children than depicted in the film. The film was based on actual events they never said it was a biography. Look at the film for what it is, an entertaining thriller which sadly had a real serial killer. Tom Hardy is wonderful, as is the cast.This is not a throwback of the cold war-this was how Russia ruled and sadly a lot of lives were lost. So watch the film, a lot of negative reviews were criticizing the depiction of Russia, read the actual accounts of how Russia handled the case and see if Child 44 just made that up.",10,1,1,21 February 2020
