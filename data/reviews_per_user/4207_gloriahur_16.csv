The Lobster," What must we do?
","This movie illustrates the problems of social pressure that has to do with marriage and to choose to fit in in a group of others who are like you. It criticizes this subject in a quite comical way. The setting and the plot of the story is obviously exaggerated and only representative of some aspects of the problem. But it does succeed it carrying the deliberate meaning and making the viewer think about the subject again. The overall aura of the movie is dull and awkwardly calm. Not only the visuals, but even the way the characters speak is bland and abnormal. The dullness might make the movie tedious for some people, but it also adds to the effect of delivering its message. Although this movie is saying how the social pressure to conform is unnecessary and even ridiculous, it has an ironic ending, that although is a cliffhanger, leaves room for the viewers to think about it.",7,0,1,18 June 2017
Gravity," Hope of Gravity
","This movie, from the beginning, is actually quite despairing and gloomy. The setting of the space makes it more desolate and heavy. The situation that the main character, Dr. Stone, gets in right from the beginning of the movie is probably the most dreadful thing that can happen in space, or anywhere, in someone's life. She gets lost in the middle of nowhere, without anyone around, and without anything to rely on except for herself and the voice of her colleague, Matt Kowalski, who is an astronaut, also being drifted away in space.The past of Dr. Stone and this present situation of her being lost somehow reflects on each other. After her daughter died, she would drive every evening, in silence, heading nowhere, just like she is in space in this situation. She says that the thing she like about the space is the silence of it in the beginning of the movie. Back on Earth, she was also completely alone after her daughter died, cut off from the world. She was lost. But then in space, as she is drifting nowhere, not knowing how she can survive, since she is a doctor, not an astronaut, she hears the voice of Matt Kowalski. He talks to her to keep her alive, and tells her what she can do to survive. And this eventually lets her find a way to survive. Even in her dream, he comes to her and talks to her.I think this is what she really needed to survive. She had lost hope- she had no purpose of living. But the voice that stayed with her raised her up. Someone was there for her to keep living. This gives her the volition to live, then that was all she thought about, to survive, and to live- to go back to Earth. When she successfully lands on Earth, she (and the audience) is relieved of the presence of gravity, of life. I think that this concise, strong story successfully delivers the message about how we all actually want to live, and how just one person's aid can lift someone up again, without any distracting elements. Some people might think that it's boring at parts, unrealistic maybe, and extremely heavy, but this movie stayed in my mind for a long time, and reminds me at times of the hope of life- of gravity.",7,0,0,27 November 2016
Train to Busan," Physical and mental catastrophes on the way to Busan
","I was actually very excited for this movie to be released, because I would've never imagined a zombie movie made it Korea, that's even set in a very-Korean setting- the train to Busan. The trailer was really interesting and the movie was even better. Some things that distracted me were some points in the story which I didn't quite understand why it had to happen and some frustrating parts.I also was a little worried how this zombie movie would turn out, how the effects might not be very realistic, and how it might be just one of those clich√© Korean dramatic movies. However, it was much more thrilling and focused than I had expected it to be. The situations were realistic and somehow relatable to what can actually happen in Korea, and the rest of the world even. Not as in the zombie virus spreading, but what could cause people to die and how people would react to such calamity.The reaction of the people was actually one of the best parts of the movie. Unlike most zombie movies, that focus more on the grotesque effects and horrifying happenings, this movie focuses on the psychological conflicts between the people and within oneself. It is quite tragic what happens in the movie, but that makes it more sensible and realistic. I could really get into the mood and the nervous terror of the situations in the movie, and of course, with the aid of some great actors and actresses.",8,1,3,22 October 2016
Passengers," Desolation in Space
","This movie is mostly focused on the emotional status of the two main characters. Although I expected the movie to have more sci-fi and action elements when I watched the trailer, the actual storyline of the movie was about how the loneliness of Jim lead to a tragedy for Aurora but eventually saved lives of thousands of people. The action that I expected was only shown in the middle part of the movie when there was no gravity for a moment. But the problem that caused it was less exciting than I thought, and the development of story after they solved the problem was too quick and couldn't make the movie dramatic until the end.The only part about the movie that I found interesting was that Jim had to choose to wake Aurora up in order for him to live, even though he knew that it will destroy her life. The resemblance of the emptiness and the vastness of space and Jim's heart, and the nature of humans, longing to be with other humans, was clearly depicted through this kind of a situation, although I wish it could've been done more thoroughly to show the emotional status of both characters.",6,1,3,5 February 2017
Begin Again," Candid but Bland
","This movie shows how the two main characters, Greta and Dan, become to be able to 'begin again' through the music and the inspiration they share with one another. Both characters had been hurt by their old 'love', but this becomes a turning point for them, through a series of coincidences. This lets both of them to find their dream again and overcome their past.The overall aura (of the city and the music) and the insight that the movie permits is remarkable, although, I wish that the story and the characters should have been developed further. Some people even say that the movie is only a series of music videos that lacks detail in the construction of the plot. This makes the movie quite boring in some parts that don't have music. However, it didn't bother me so much, since it had a short running time, and the movie was enjoyable for the most part, including all the heart-warming songs and a great ending.",7,0,1,11 February 2017
Life of Pi," Terrifying beauty of isolation
","When the movie first came out, I had never heard about it before, so it just seemed like a boring story about relationship between man and animal. However, after I read the original book that the movie is based on, I could't wait to watch the movie. I actually didn't expect the movie to be so well-made, but it portrayed the original story pretty well and the cinematography was beautiful. One thing I was worried about was how the movie will not be able to tell all the stories that Pi tells in the book, about his childhood, and just his thoughts throughout the journey. Nevertheless, the expressions on the actor's face that cannot be seen by reading the book brought out a new feeling and meaning to the movie. In this sense, the casting of the actor was very good. This movie might seem boring because there is literally just one character who can talk for most part of the movie and a few animals, but the visuals, music, and the expressiveness of the movie fills it up and makes the scale of the movie grand. I found some of the effects a little awkward, but it was great overall. This movie is incredibly artistic and visually appealing, and the deep meaning behind the story also makes it worth it to watch it.",9,0,1,18 June 2017
Doctor Strange," Surreal effects, exciting development of story
","This was a great movie to watch to relieve stress and have fun. The best things about the movie were the fantastic effects, of course by Marvel studios, and the humor that never stops. The story isn't very deep, teaching nothing to the audience except to not to text while driving, but comedy fills it up. Even the villains of the movie are comical. The graphics and effects playing with dimensions were very impressive and added to the quality of the movie.The cast was also great, although the movie drifted from the original comics where Dr. Strange was an Asian. The humor and the excessive talking of Benedict Cumberbatch was very natural, except that I really couldn't get used to his American accent, but it wasn't disturbing. The Ancient One's epicene look and character was also well played by Tilda Swinton. The story of the movie goes on pretty quickly, not allowing the audience to take their eyes off the screen. The plot is original and exciting from the beginning till the end, although some parts are predictable. It isn't at all realistic, but successfully lets the audience drift away from reality for the least 115 minutes. For me, this movie was one of the best Marvel studio movies.",7,2,3,26 November 2016
Little Miss Sunshine," Comical but tedious
","Before I watched the movie, I had hear a lot of good things about it so I was really looking forward to watching it. However, it was very difficult for me to watch it until the end. The story line was pretty easy to predict and tediously slow. There was nothing in particular in the movie that was outstanding or interesting. It wasn't particularly attractive visually, nor very humorous or touching.But still there were some unexpected parts that could be entertaining or touching after you think about it again. The characters were all very distinct and familiar in real life, and the few darkly comical scenes made me smirk. Also, the acting was great, and I was especially impressed by Paul Dano's acting. Overall, it wasn't a bad movie, but I wouldn't necessarily watch it twice.",6,1,4,17 June 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Fantastic but not so exciting
","This movie was very popular among fans of previous Harry-Potter series, and as a person who had never watched one of them, I didn't expect the movie to be so amusing. It was actually very fun to watch it and good for spending extra time. The movie has very well-made visual effects and I could see how much money would've been spent on it. I had wished to have watched it in the cinemas. However, the plot proved it to be just one of those big-budget fantasy movie. So do not watch it for the story, I would say. The story line is very predictable and unoriginal, but I liked some scenes that were visually wonderful or humorous. It was also very interesting to see all the fantastic beasts that have peculiar characteristics- I wish there would've been more story about how he got them and what they are like. Overall, I did like the movie, and I would love to see the sequel of this one.",7,0,1,18 June 2017
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Attractive picture book
","As soon as I saw the poster of the movie, I was captured by its unique and artistic colors and picture. And as a person who especially enjoy mystery films, I couldn't not watch it. And it was as good as I thought it would be, or even better. There is a unique aura throughout the movie that takes the viewer into a different world- one like a fairy tale or a picture book because of its cinematography and effects. (Although it wouldn't be at all for children) The color scheme is beautiful and very visually appealing. Although the story might be predictable and the development of it slightly sudden and unusual and even boring to some people, it is entertaining and it was not tedious at all for me with its short running time. There are many scenes that are darkly comical and it's almost like you're in a game in some scenes such as when they escape prison and are being chased. Like this, this movie is truly peculiar and is not just a commercial film. It's beautiful and attractive like a piece of art.",9,1,2,18 June 2017
Jurassic World," Entertaining but maybe a little too incoherent in story
","Although extremely unrealistic and incoherent in the actual story line, this movie achieves its purpose to thrill and entertain the audience through high-quality visual and sound effects. No one actually expects any kind of emotive story or philosophical meaning in these kinds of movies. However, even without looking at the part about how well it delivered any kind of a message to the audience, there are flaws and inconsistency in the flow of the plot. There are also happening that really were not necessary, and some parts were just way to unrealistic that it made me lose focus and cringe at it. For example, there is no way a woman in skirts and heels can faster, or as fast as a T-Rex, even if it's a fake, man-made one. But still, the movie didn't get boring in any part unless the easily predictable story line does. For me, I didn't mind the usual old story, because I had watched it for the physical experience itself of watching the magical creatures and being scared by the way-too- loud roaring and screaming of both dinosaurs and humans.",6,1,2,13 March 2017
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Relatable story portrayed unusually
","This movie is to me, one of the best romantic movies I've ever seen. It is unique and not tedious at all even though it had been a while since it came out. The complex order of story might seem a little confusing in the beginning, I think that the structure of the movie actually plays a big role in building up the emotions. And it adds to its distinctiveness by being sort of sci-fi. The story itself is very humorous, realistic, and relatable. The sci-fi element makes the realistic situations twisted and comical, and that makes it even more enjoyable to watch for the viewers. This movie also shows the state of mind and the thought process of a person going to the course of a relationship very well, allowing almost anyone to relate to it. This makes the movie especially attractive and touching. Also, the beautiful music and visuals play a role in bringing out the moods of different scenes, and make it more special.",9,0,0,18 June 2017
Alice in Wonderland," Boring and Meaningless
","The visual effects are great, as all Tim Burton movies are. Beautiful colors, costumes, etc. The story should have been based more on the original tale, and not make up some meaningless battle between the pretty queen and the ugly queen. The plot is obstinate and the action is not at all exciting.The characters are actually interesting and distinctive, each dressed beautifully. But they don't seen very related to each other, maybe because of the unique characteristics but there are no elements that makes the viewer tie them as actual 'friends' or 'team'. The most friendly character is actually the bandersnatch. AND Alice always orders everyone to do everything for her and is very selfish.The story then goes on very slowly without any exciting thing happening, except for some parts where the Red queen acts silly. She's my second favorite character. After all, everyone hates her and she needs mental treatment, not be banished to some scary place. Anyways, the story continues on until Alice successfully kills the Jabberwocky with her weak arm power and saves the cheeky White queen. Actually, it was the Cheshire cat who was the real hero. Then, Alice leaves and she succeeds in not marrying Hamish and feeding her family.",5,2,3,22 October 2016
Her," True emotions gone wrong
","This movie is one of the movies that I don't understand why it is getting so much praise from people. I get that the cinematography and the soundtrack is beautiful and the plot is unique, but maybe way too odd and not well concluded. To talk about the positive aspects, the colors and the angles in the cinematography is fascinating and along with the soundtrack helps create the misty, sentimental mood throughout the movie. There are also some comic parts that keeps the audience focused. From the actual story itself, the audience may sympathize with the loneliness o the main character, as the background of his situations are well shown in parts of the movie. However, the topic about dating a computer, or an A.I., does not really let the audience identify with it, at least for me. First of all, I cannot understand why the computer fell in love with the man in the first place, because even if it has emotions, it does not know the man or feel as lonely as the man did. Also, the ending, although I haven't watched it and only heard it from my friends, is not very satisfactory.",6,2,2,13 March 2017
The Martian," Humorous and Interesting
","This movie was different from what I expected from watching all the other futuristic space-sci-fi movies. I would say it is more realistic than other space movies, but still, its science fiction. This movie does focus more on the humanly aspects of survival and isolation than technical and scientific aspects. And this also does make the plot a little contrived and the heroic behavior of the characters and the happy ending is pretty predictable. (Although its also allows it to have some amusing scenes that I enjoyed.) However, it is entertaining to see how he survives in such harsh conditions of the huge planet of mars, and how the contact with another human lets his life go on. This movie also illustrates the importance of a single human life. The visuals of this movie is very clean and grand like all futuristic movies, and it's fun to see the huge spaceships and the planet Mars.",8,0,0,18 June 2017
Atonement," Heart-rending, ardent love broken by war
","On the surface, this movie seems just like a normal tragic love story. But this story is actually well used in delivering a strong message. The painfulness of living with guilt, and unchanging love only causing hopeless yearning for each other is shown very well in this movie, through a heart-touching story, beautiful and desolate setting, and the great acting of the actors.In this movie, the main character, Robbie is falsely charged and taken as a soldier to war, and Cecilia is left behind, longing for her lover, because of a single incident caused by her sister, Briony. Briony had the prejudice against Robbie that led to the problem. They do meet after a few years, but as difficult as it was to just meet again, it is not easy for them to start their relationship again. They promise to meet again, as Robbie leaves again for war, and they are separated for another several years, which becomes forever after all.Even though Briony was the one who had falsely accused Robbie, she was just the spark that led to the tragedy. It wasn't wholly her fault that the two couldn't be together. It was the atrocious war, that destroyed love, families, and lives of people. All because of the greed of some people. The harsh conditions of the war, and the destruction of innocent lives is eloquently, and movingly shown. This gave me a strong impression, and made me rethink about the cruelty of war, and humans, ultimately.The 'atonement', after all, must not only be from Briony, who was late in her confession about her mistakes, but also for the victims of war. This powerful message, both about fallacy and war, that is delivered through this movie, makes it a must-watch.",9,0,0,23 September 2016
