First Man," Amazing Film! Pity About the Criticism of Accuracy!
","I've read many reviews complaining about there being too many close-ups. If the space vehicles were the same size as the Starship Enterprise, the same people would be criticising the film for it's lack of realism. Gemini and Apollo were called 'capsules' for a reason. Close-ups were the only option, unless the director was expected to shoot the movie through the windows!Also on the point of accuracy. I see the dirty condition of the cockpits were highlighted as 'Goofs'. The Director used the real Gemini and Apollo capsules for realism. No cleaning was allowed as you would be effectively causing destruction to an historical artefact!I agree there some accuracy and timeline errors, but they were so minor that only hardcore space race fans would have picked up on (and I am one!) It didn't detract from the story for me.It was great to see the humanising of such a private and historical figure.",8,0,1,28 January 2019

From Hell," Fantastic Representation of the Atmosphere and Era - Just Ignore the Innacuracies
","A fine representation of the attitudes and the atmosphere of Victorian Era circa 1888.
The identified Ripper suspect and the motives for the crimes were discounted decades ago.
Numerous historical innaccuracies also, but entertaining if taken as a work of fiction rather than a true representation of the Ripper Crimes and History.Eg. Aberline relaxing whilst listening to a gramophone. The Gramaphone was patented in 1887, therefore it would have existed at the time, however, obtaining one would have been prohibitively expensive, reserved for Royalty and Aristocracy. Well out of the price range of a humble Police Inspector with an Opium habit.The real Aberline was an alcoholic, not an opium addict and lived to middle age. He was a brilliant detective, though not psychic.",8,0,0,2 November 2018
Mystic River," Missed Out
","The only thing nor heinous than the murder in the movie and the execution of the wrong mn is the fact it took me so long to watch this movie. 16 years old, and still an amazing movie,
Wouldn't expect less f Om Clint Eastwood!",8,1,2,1 March 2019
