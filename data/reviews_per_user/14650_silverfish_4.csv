Vertigo," A true Classic
","This is a very tense and dramatic Thriller.  The acting in this is brilliant.  The plot is very well written and the twist are very shocking and take you by suprise.  This could have easily lost its tension near the end, but this manages to be tension right up to the last minute.  A Brilliant film, that no-one should miss.  A classic.",10,2,4,10 October 2001
Liar Liar," A great comedy
","The scenario for this film, a lawyer who's son's wish means he can't is milked for all its comic value here.  There are a number of very funny scenes, but the film is consistently funny throughout.  The humour is as madcap as in Ace Ventura, but here the plot is quite a bit more developed.Near the end this gets a bit too corny, but generally a very funny film.",8,0,0,10 October 2001
Scream 2," A disappointing sequel
","The problem with this film is that after the original that showed up some of the cliches in horror films, this seems to be trying to invent its own.  One in particular is the tendency for characters to split up for no apparent reason, allowing the killer to kill one of them.The plot is not as good as that of the original, with quite a few holes in it.  The first killing in the original was very well executed, and convincing, but in this, the first killing is poorly executed and unconvincing, although the idea behind it is quite good.This film is probably worth watching, but does not have the spark of originality that the original had.  It is scary in places, and has funny moments but this is by no means as good as the original was.",4,1,2,30 October 2001
Scream," An interesting take on the horror genre
","This is a horror film, but also a sort of spoof of horror films.  It plays around with some of the rules and cliches of the genre, whilst avoiding using them.  Whilst in the middle it gets slightly sidetracked, it is a good horror film in its own right, with quite a few scary moments, and some 'false' scares, when we expect something to happen but something else does. There is quite a bit of comedy, but also this film has its fair share of tension.All in all, a film well worth watching.",7,0,0,30 October 2001
