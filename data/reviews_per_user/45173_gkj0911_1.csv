The Blair Witch Project," Excellent depiction of human fear!
","This is the first movie, that I have seen, that actually had me afraid. Connecting with the characters was easy, and the surrounding scenery was quite spooky.  I have to say that this one is truly, one-of-a-kind.  The ending left me wanting more.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes horror/sci-fi.  Totally believable.",10,1,2,9 August 1999
