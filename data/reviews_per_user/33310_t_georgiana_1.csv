Mission: Impossible III," good action movie
","Great movie, action, adventure, thriller, even moderated romance are included together within a plot that catches your attention from the start to the end.It keeps you with the breath hold non-stop, taking you from one suspense action scene to an unexpected other, keeping the mystery of who's the bad guy infiltrated in their team and how everything will end up till the very last minutes of the movie.Plus, the futuristic technology devices and solutions, the stake of the game, the excellent training and the dram of luck depending on the circumstances make Tom Cruise appear a superhero that fights with the impossible and strives to overwhelm it till the end.It certainly worth seeing it.",9,0,1,13 October 2006
