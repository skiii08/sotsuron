Requiem for a Dream," Favorite movie from favorite director
","One of my favorite movies. From one of my favorite directors. Each character descends into their own kind of drug hell. It's a beautiful train wreck you can't look away from. Sara Goldfarb's joyous need to fit into her red dress is doped into a psychosis that consumes her. Marion Silver surrounds her clothes-designing talent with heroin until only heroin is left. Her descent is painted on her face as her make up becomes more garish with each scene. Tyrone C. Love loses his freedom and Harry Goldfarb loses his very arm. The gut-punch is so real - the heartbreak so well communicated. It's kind of hard to believe that this movie is so beautifully wrought, but it is.",9,1,1,19 February 2020
Hereditary," A near perfect directorial debut
","A beautifully well-made horror movie with genuine fear, the kind to watch for. A strange family has tragedy after tragedy to deal with until finally all is clear, and scary. First the grandma dies, then the strange tween girl is tragically hit, then things really get going. Toni Collete, magnificent as always, will sweep you up with her emotional roller-coaster until your eyes are too opened.",Null,0,0,14 May 2020
Elf," Of course Jon Favreau directed this
","It has Jon Favreau all over it. And that other guy, the one in every scene. And thank god for that because that Will Ferrell is so funny he can BE in every scene and you still want more. This movie is sweet. It's funny as hell without hurting anyone. It's gentle humor so perfect for an xmas tale. In this one a human man who has been raised as one of Santa's elves is told the truth by his tiny elven 'father'. This makes the chance for hilarious sight gags of Will Ferrell being too big for his life. When he finds out his actual father is a human in NYC (and on the naughty list) he sets off to find him. Will Ferrell's elf is a character so full of love that he can push his way in and be happily received, even if not right away.",7,1,1,2 March 2020
Fargo," Classic flick that ages well
","It's touted to be a true story but it ain't. Alas, one hates to see artists one is impressed with stoop to a marketing ploy right in the movie itself but it's not my call. No Coen asked me what I thought about it while they were making the movie. At any rate Fargo itself is a joy. It's wonderful fun much like Raising Arizona. Each character is developed. They react with that character's actual reactions. They talk as that character would actually talk. Then there is the exquisite storytelling to behold. The story of a car salesman who married the rich boss's daughter and has been squelched in his father-in-law's shadow ever since. His father-in-law holds him in low esteem and never fails to hammer the point. But, one can see why. Our antihero is a sniveling shirker who takes no responsibility for his life and thinks no further ahead than yesterday. Instead of coming up with a real plan to improve his life he hires two goons to kidnap his wife so he can snag the ransom that her daddy would have to ante up. The best laid plans!",9,0,0,22 April 2020
Warrior," Great story, acting
","Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton play brothers who, after a movie-long build-up of their two individual lives face off for the championship and purse of the MMA 'superbowl,' Sparta. The two brothers have a chip on their respective shoulders on account of their drunk of a father, Nick Nolte. That serves to give them hard, gruff, life-long resentment that translates into the ring for exciting, breath-halting fights. All the performances are topnotch.",6,1,1,18 February 2020
The Grand Budapest Hotel," One of the best movies by one of the best directors
","A joy. The saga of the Grand Budapest and its concierge. There is nothing like Ralph Fiennes in a comedy. It's really the saga of the concierge and his lobby boy. The two of them embark on adventures right out of a spy novel. One of the concierge's women is found dead, murdered. He inherits a million-dollar painting from her. He is accused of the murder. He is imprisoned. He escapes. A wonderful chase and gunfight ensues. Well, it's all wonderful.",9,0,0,21 February 2020
Room," Loved it
","In this emotional takeover a young mama and her son are imprisoned for years by her baby-daddy who kidnapped her and kept her for sex even after he got her pregnant. Where they are imprisoned isn't important as it's the relationship between them and how the mother tries to build a world for her child where it's ok that they are the only two people he knows (except for the kidnapper's visits from which he hides) and this is the only place he knows. Next it is important how she builds him up to be able to go out into the world alone. These are the things that make this movie something to watch, not logistics. The second act is a little weak yes, and mores the pity but that doesn't detract from the set up.",8,0,1,19 February 2020
The Man Who Would Be King," One the best movies ever made
","I must have seen this eleven times. Can't get enough. Sean Connery! and Michael Caine! Hells yeah! Both at their sexiest time in life, too. Not to mention the ridiculously good cast around them. And I dislike Rudyard Kipling, so to get past that this story HAD to be a knock-out, and it is. Two British soldiers in Victorian India who have lost their way now that there is no war to fight decide to conquer Kafiristan, a primitive country only reached by walking over the Himalayas.",8,0,3,21 February 2020
Rosemary's Baby," Roman Polanski is bringing it
","A young couple move into a swanky apartment in Manhattan only to find out their neighbors in the building are witches. Roman Polanski is bringing it in this, his first Hollywood movie. This horror movie is so slick and beautiful, so well-paced and placed that one can hardly believe it was made in the 60s. There are few horror movies from that era that evoke the kind of fear and tension that this Baby does. He sports beautiful NYC shots, slick styles and perfect timing, a hallmark of Polanski. The intricately written story is played by a stellar cast, including a damn near nascent Charles Grodin.",8,0,0,11 May 2020
30 Days of Night," Better than I thought it would be
","For some reason I put off watching this movie even when I started falling hard for horror, even after I realized that horror was fast becoming the premier art form of century 21. Something about the title put me off. Luckily I forgot what that off-putting thing was and lo, was able not only to watch it, but to enjoy it. I have no problem with certain tropes within the horror genre. Scratch that, I have no problem with most tropes within the horror genre, so long as they are in furtherance of a prime bit of horroring. I therefore give zero focks that the three givens were, well, given, since these three are pretty much de rigueur: 1. hitting with the car, 2. killing of the pets, and 3. ominous aerial view. The only trope I did have a problem with is the the-two-prettiest-people-in-the-movie-who-have-broken-up-for-no-good-reason-and-who-take-the-whole-damn-movie-to-get-back-together trope. Especially because of the gut wrenching use (read: overuse) of the and-one-of-them-sacrificing-himself-for-the-good-of-the-many correlation. Blech. The one redeeming virtue of the use of this particular overused clich√© is that once the husband at the center of The Couple to Beat is dead the only male left for the newly minted widow to mate with in this newly minted town of 'Barrow, population 5' is that dead hero's little teenage brother. Ah, poetic justice. It's just so just.",7,0,0,22 April 2020
Parasite," A well told tale
","A well told tale of a family of have-naughts who lie their way into a job for each member in the home of a rich family. They engineer the firing of the people they replace. People who deserved nothing of the kind. Plus the son of the pushy family disregards his promise to the friend who set him up with this rich family and he totally moves in on the little school-girl daughter he was supposed to be safe guarding. While so engaged they find a secret. Or rather a secret is given them. This movie is beautifully shot and well presented. It's a story in movements. It has the power to draw you in so much so that you forget what things were like, back there in the beginning. Back there in the basement.",7,0,0,23 April 2020
1408," Ham-fisted
","Heavy machinery instead of talent - in the acting, in the writing, in a lot. A famous debunking author checks into a famously haunted hotel room #1408. It seemed so trite so me, like rehash, and not scary at all.",4,0,0,26 February 2020
Life," This movie made me tired
","I have no problem with the similarity to Alien and other movies where people have to battle an omnipotent creature. Just because Alien was made doesn't mean that storyline is taboo. It was done before Alien many times and after many times. It will be done over and over because that's one of the reasons one creates a nonhuman entity, to give it seemingly all powerful capability. Alien doesn't own the idea, but I still look for a story well told. This is a lame story told by competent technicians. A pretty, well-made movie with poor writing is just that. I'm a horror fan, a horror fanatic, to the point that I buy into the whole 'people in horror stories do stupid things, get over it' conceit, but if you start with astronauts they are supposed to be a wee but intelligent and a wee bit trained. If every single one of them reacts to the admittedly unnerving situation stupidly, even the ones who are watching the story unfold and have time to gather their thoughts, well then you've destroyed too much credibility. It was bad enough that they 1. took so long to rescue the Hugh Derry character or 2. rescued him out of the lab at all, but for every single one of them to blunder so blatantly became tedious. Once Miranda North tried to get back into the air lock, and once they tried to HELP her back in, it was like Why Bother? My other beef is that they never touched on the fact that the alien was only defending itself. They took it from its home planet and started giving it shocks! They never once tried to communicate. I will say that there were some gripping moments during the chase inside the space station. That's not enough.",4,0,1,13 June 2020
What We Do in the Shadows," Loads of fun
","A quartet of vampires, each from a different century, shares a house as roommates. They spend their time living their lives as any quartet of men would - demanding the dishes get washed, requesting one put down towels before biting a victim on the antique sofa, trying on outfits before going out to party up - but they do so while flying around, hissing and hypnotizing people. It's loads of fun.",8,0,1,18 February 2020
Alien: Covenant," Mostly good
","A little heavy handed, but, luckily, Michael Fassbender rubs the right way. He's the android his spaceship relies upon. In their journeying they find his prototype alone on a planet. Their similarity is uncanny. But is that inside as well as outside? This is a colonization ship. They are on their way to a planet chosen for its similarity to Earth and its adaptability to human needs. En route they encounter a message from the planet the Prometheus landed on ten years previously. That's how it has the prototype android.",6,0,1,12 May 2020
