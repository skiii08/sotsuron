Marie Antoinette," she looks like a child....
","i've had several weeks to reflect on this film, and it has left a very good taste in my mouth. I was surprised by Kirsten Dunst's portrayal of the doomed queen, yet really another victim of isolation and privilege. I believe it is the most well rounded performance of her career, and i loved her in this role. my thought is that Quentin Tarantino has had some influence with Sophia Coppola's already impressive resume of films. Marie Antoinette has a lyrical, whimsical ambiance, with beautiful cinematography and great costumes and dress. Jason Schwartzman's Louis XVI was great; and i watched for the marvelous Marianne Faithful too, but i found her unrecognizable and under- used. Judy Davis is ALWAYS good and i make a point of seeing her films. I appreciated that there was no big build up to the fate of the last king and queen of France, a departure from the other films about them. i was unlucky to be sitting in front of people loudly proclaiming that they had no idea about what happened to her, nor anything about French and global politics at the time. Their assessment of the film was, that it was too slow. It wasn't for me. I wanted more. I can understand some of the criticisms aimed at this film but i truly enjoyed it. Marie-Antoinette reminded me of other doomed queens, such as Queen Jane, who were women, and children both. Ms Coppola skips the reign of terror, the mass be-headings, and the desperation of the times, and opts for a film filled with naivety and isolation, lack of choice and family. i liked this approach, and i'd watch the film again. a beautiful, under-rated film which somehow manages to blend a sense of fun and innocence leading towards the gruesome result which history records. (schwartzman bears an uncanny resemblance to the portraits of the ill-fated Louis..) Special kudos to the costume team as well, who captured 1700's France with immaculate detail.",9,5,9,14 November 2006
United 93," heart break
","Everything about United 93 is heart breaking to watch. From the Arabs praying with their Koran, to the smiling faces of the personnel facing what must have seemed like just another day; the person who boarded at the last minute. Paul Greengrass's docudrama is a superb piece of film making. We have the benefit of hind sight and fore knowledge, and yet, as information filtered to the people involved, it seemed surreal, unbelievable, tragic, and baffling. If this film is viewed by film goers who have also watched WHY WE FIGHT, the astonishing, brilliant documentary by Eugene Jarecki, it adds profoundly to our understanding of the human condition. And then there is everybody's favorite whipping boy, Michael Moore, who always tells the truth in his own, sardonic, passionate way. Regardless of how you may feel about him, his perspective is helpful and he doesn't lie. It's difficult for me to comment much further, since United 93 is a film wrought with emotion. Regardless of our personal beliefs, our own convictions, our own sense of the world, people died that day. It show cased the best and the worst in us. Many people die every day all over this complex world and for many of the same reasons. It was hard to speak during, and after viewing this film..... We will never know exactly what happened that day, and Greengrass's meticulous research is a testament to him. It is a film about human beings facing an extraordinary day and how they responded to it, and yes, in an extraordinary way. There was no finger pointing, no demonetization, no focus on the body politic, no jingoistic call for war nor anger. But the themes of love, love for family, love for friends, courage, desperation, cooperation, fear, acceptance. rebellion... I watched his other docudrama, BLOODY Sunday, and this film has the same type of style. But this film flew by, and it felt like it was only a few minutes in length. It left me breathless by the end, and i wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for most people. A remarkable film about an infamous day. It is a great monument to the people who died that day. A portion of the monies generated from United 93 went to their monument. In RAN, Kurosawa reminds us that when we forget history, we are doomed to repeat it, to walk the same path over and over. My hope is that we move forward as a species....United 93 is a painful yet important film. many people were praying in this film, from beginning to end. i wonder; were they all praying to the same God? screenplay A direction A editing A+",10,4,8,6 September 2006
Spider-Man 2," Mr Evil Dead!!!!
","i watched SPIDERMAN and SPIDERMAN 2 when they were released, and i didn't write a review about either of them. Better late than never. This wont be much of an overview of the films; just a great big thank you Mr Sam Raimi for your great comic book hero come to life. I saw what you could do with no money, a great friend/eternal hero, camera angles, and sound, with your EVIL DEAD series, and look at what you can do with a budget. This is one of those rare times when the sequel was as good if not better than the first, and i am looking forward to SPIDERMAN 3 with anticipation. I wouldn't mind seeing another A SIMPLE PLAN type of film from you either. These are some of the best action-hero comic book character(s) i've ever seen brought to life. The ensemble casts with the likes of Alfred Molina, Thomas Hayden Church, Willam Dafoe, Cliff Robertson, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco, Bryce Dallas Howard, Theresa Russell, Topher Grace, and of course, the spiderman himself, Tobey Maguire, is a treat in itself. Nice touch with Ted, Lucy, Bruce, and Briget too. gotta say, i'm a big Raimi fan....",10,13,22,9 January 2007
Alexander," OK oliver
","i laughed out loud while watching this movie. i haven't enjoyed all of Oliver Stone's films so i'll give him this one. this movie left me wondering several things: 1) was Alexander's mother born before, or at the same time as her son?(and why did she go to a transylvanian voice coach?) 2) how much hydrogen peroxide was in the bleach Colin used? 3) did Val use plasticine on his face in the hopes of being unrecognizable? 4) did anyone go to the library to help with the pacing of this film? you know, those buildings with books in them? 5) was Bucephalous black, or white? did anyone care? (he was the best actor anyways) 6) if i had 9 figures to spend making a movie, would it have been this bad? (more proof that throwing money at a film doesn't do the trick) 7) did the people making this film know it was about Alexander the GREAT? did they know he was an extraordinary leader? or did someone tell them he was an angst-filled whiner? (see question #4) this film has my vote at the razzies this year for worst film. as i said i found myself laughing out loud. other leads turned the film down. if Alexander had been played by David Spade or Paulie Shore, i may have been more charitable of this mess of a film. please please, no more director's cuts or added footage...and by the way, i am a fan of most of the actors in this movie. what happened? but i stand by my statement about bucephalous. this animal didn't over-act, had a legitimate accent, and stood his ground with that poor elephant, who also gets a nod of approval from me. as far as i can tell, these are two characters who had no choice about being in this movie.*arguabley 'not bad' aspects of Alexander: 1)the desert/battle scenes, aka THE MUMMY 2)the blood looked real 3)employed a LOT of costumers for those thousands of outfits 4)the men looked better than the women (except Eva green) 5)mass carcass scenes post-battle, aka GONE WITH THE WIND, but not nearly as good. 6)not bad historical narrative by sir Anthony. otherwise, 'huh'? 7)by all accounts, Alexander was a progressive and compassionate ruler, compared to his brutal times. much like Alfred the Great was ahead of his time in this aspect. 8)many 'boys will be boys' scenes, aka BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, but not nearly in the same league..nor universe, come to think of it... 9)some great busts, murals, statues and other art scattered around in the back ground 10)a zebra!! 11)one can forgive the globally conscious and compassionate Jolie for just about anything...you may want to give it a watch, if you can get past the first few minutes. i only gave it a one based on the economy-busting amount of money that Mr Stone had to work with...perhaps i should upgrade my rating to, 1.01.",1,114,188,6 October 2005
Brokeback Mountain," exquisite force of nature
","BBM is one of the most credible love stories' i have seen. taking it's time to build the relationship, nothing in this remarkable film felt contrived, or unbelievable. the mountains in the background i have seen and traveled on many times, and they are that beautiful. the cast,each of whom were so good their performances were mesmerizing, adapted screenplay, beautiful score and cinematography were heart-breakingly spectacular. no one made a false step, and it is by far the best film i have seen in a very long time. the film also held a few surprises for me: 1)the first physical love scene aroused me.2) the make-up aging of Jake and Heath was amazing.3) i don't want to be a cow boy or a cow girl. this is my problem. i have nothing against the cow boys and girls. i wont get in to why but let's just say they are a bit too anthropocentric for me.4) Anne Hathaway can play bitch, and play it well. 5)Michelle Williams can say more with her eyes than many of the best actors around.6) not much has changed since the start-time of BBM. this in itself is disheartening. for example, we just voted in a TROLL here in this beautiful country, where this film was made. this makes this film SIN, not love. the real sin here, is intolerance. this film is for adult audiences who enjoy great movies. the heartbreak of unfulfilled love, and the joys of it, are told better here than in any other film i've seen. i hope it sweeps the Oscars. and a shut-out in acting categories would be a travesty. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were brilliant. Not for one moment did i not believe that they were in love. is it better to walk away from love, and always ask what may have happened? or embrace it and risk hurting those who love you? i took that chance, an anguished, painful choice; and i'd do it again... but i did not have to risk being murdered for it. the greatest gift that humanity has is love. it didn't matter an iota whether this poignant love was between two men,two women, a man and a woman, or the love we have for any of our fellow creatures. love transcends all of that. this film embodies this essence. social intolerance is the true shame here. BrokeBack Mountain is an understated, yet compelling, lasting, stunning film. thank you, Mr Lee, for another great, great film. you can indeed help 'change the way people think'. for a better world...",10,37,44,23 January 2006
Crash," LA Confidential 2
","let's see; corrupt, racist cops, a protagonist who has no idea who he is; a great, ensemble cast; actors playing against type (mostly), the fact that things haven't changed much; Crash is very much like a better movie called LA Confidential, but without the complex story-line and subtlety of the latter. but, having said that, Crash is one of the best films i've ever seen. more than many other films, CRASH changed me in more than just theory but in a tangible way. it showed the good and not so good in all of us; how complex human beings are, how shiny happy people on the surface can be the most lonely and isolated amongst us. i found it to be a poignant, subtle, intricate montage filled with heart-breaking nuances and circumstances and yet held a positive view for our species. desperation, bigotry, anger, helplessness, personal power, luck, courage and cowardice were all there. Paul Haggis' film is a 'million dollar baby' in a world filled with such complexity and contradiction, and CRASH let our compassion, kindness, and ability to change shine through despite the ugliness in our world, and demonstrated how compassion and beauty can escalate as quickly as violence. this movie is going straight in my collection of favorite films to watch. it was also nice to see how good Thandie Newton and Ryan Philippe can be as actors while solidifying the performance standards of Matt Dillon and Don Cheadle. and how refreshing to see Sandra Bullock play a B**ch! everyone was superb. the cast deserves awards for ensemble cast, and the score was memorable. the screen play was both understated and powerful, a perfect blend. we are imperfect beings, but we are remarkable. as is this film. after reading some of the anti-Canadian commentaries about this film, for you Canadian critics out there, particularly the one who claims we should stick to what we know (hockey); i cant be the only one who sees the irony of these anti-Canadian comments. Haggis being Canadian has nothing to do with this film. the irony made me laugh. they only serve to validate this film even more. Atom Egoyan, Anne Wheeler, Lorne Michaels, Sylvan Chauvet, James Cameron, Denys Arcand, Norman Jewison, David Cronenberg, Arthur Hiller, Claude Jutra, Louis b Mayer and Ivan Reitman, to name a few, have being Canadian in common. although i'm willing to bet most of them have laced up a few pairs of skates, the last time i checked, they weren't on any hockey teams. film as an art form, can be masterpieces. we live in a global community, where bigotry and stereotyped views exist all over the planet. but as Sam-Wise says, there's good in this world too. that's the message i received from this great film. i didn't see it as an indictment on 'americans' by an outsider. for me it was a comment on the complexity of man, that we're not just labels, and that good and not-so-good exists in All of us, that we are a flawed species and need to continually re-evaluate ourselves. i'm sorry if you felt this was an attack on America. if you think that bigotry of all kinds doesn't exist in Canada, nor anywhere else for that matter, come on up and visit sometime. and don't forget your skates. an American icon named Clint Eastwood chose Haggis to write the screenplay for one of his growing list of consistently amazing films. his work as a director is nothing short of astonishing. that alone says a LOT about both of them. footnote*** i had a chance to ask Terrence Howard two questions:1) 'why do you think people are so divided about Crash?' Terrence: 'i think it's because it forces people to look at questions about themselves that they haven't answered' 2)'would you work with Paul Haggis again?' Terrence:' are you kidding? i'd mow the man's lawn'. Terrence, i'd watch any film you're in in a new york minute...i've been doing some 'asking around' after the best picture win at the Oscars. my preference was BBM, and strongly; but i wasn't surprised that Crash took home the big prize. people say, that Crash was 'too in your face', too 'preachy', and too 'obvious'. yeah, it was in your face; yeah, it was obvious. racism, and racial profiling is obvious. but we're not suppose to talk about it. we're expected to know it's all around us, so we don't need to hear about it nor think about it, nor see it. we have to be 'subtle'. Too damn bad that this film may compel you to confront these things. too damn bad it's so in your face....",10,7,15,10 September 2005
Knocked Up," knuckled under
","I was uncomfortable through out this film, having to watch stereotype after stereotype, mean-spirited 'jokes' and juvenile toilet humour. Let's look at the good:Leslie Mann: Her shallow, annoying character was played very well by Ms. Mann; and by the end, she was even somewhat sympathetic. Harold Ramis: His two-minute scene was the ONLY truly likable character in this entire film. I loved him. Paul Rudd: Despite his woe-begone fatalistically brow-beaten character, Rudd was genuinely good. Too bad his character was 'resigned' to what looked like a life not worth living.The Bad:The jab at a guy like Stephen Hawking. Yeah; this film sinks that low. The stereotype that 'pot-heads' are all unemployed, long-haired dopes with prurient life goals; think again... Heigl with Rogen's character? No way. This is a guy who grabbed his BONG during an earthquake without a thought to her safety. I could relate to her exasperation with Ben and his friends...but ending up with him? Sure....The conversations about Munich were very insensitive; but then, this entire film was, so at least it was consistent. Endorsing De Beers?? The toilet humour..really. The reference to a woman's anatomy using the C-word, more than once, is misogynistic and really dumb. The kids, played by Apatows daughters, were cute; but I felt like they were being exploited. 'I googled murder' today? Lovely. That list with the Canadian Beavers, headed by Pamela Anderson, Lolita Davidovich, Natasha Henstridge, and another woman, wasn't funny for me.Even the second bar scene, where Mann and Heigl, who had previously pushed their way to the front of the line without a thought to 'the ugly people' waiting in line, didn't play out as sympathetic at all. We are suppose to laugh at a situation where, they are now barred from line-jumping because Heigl is pregnant and Mann is 'too old'? And the 5% quota for certain races? I felt sick.This film wasn't completely unfunny. Some of the scenes with the Hollywood execs. played quite well by Kristin Wiig and Alan Tudyk, were humorous. 'This is Hollywood. We don't like liars here...'.Even the title of this film is offensive to me. I went because I loved The 40-yr Old Virgin, and because it was reviewing very very well across the board. Instead, what I saw was a crass piece of work that has been done many times before, by a director who is capable of much much better. If I were ever trapped with these characters, I would smile feebly and back out of the room asap.What scares me is how popular this film is. What does that say about us? Maybe, this film isn't that influential in the long run. But it definitely reflects the taste rampant in the throngs of people lining up to see this horrible film, for a SECOND time, and declaring it the funniest 'comedy' they've ever seen.I don't think so.",1,227,411,8 June 2007
Capote," Kaput-ee
","i'll begin by saying that i am a huge fan of Philip Seymour Hoffman. I loved his work in Boogie Nights, with a sensitive and moving performance; i loved him in Twister; his enthusiasm and animated character; and his brilliant turn in The Talented Mr.Ripley. I've never met Truman Capote. I knew him only through watching his interviews and taking a glimpse at his media image. I didn't like him. Perhaps this colours my feeling about Hoffman's portrayal of him. I credit him for his dead-on mimicry of the author of IN COLD BLOOD. But i didn't enjoy it. I found the scene with Clifton Collins jr much more intriguing; and the subject matter of his book far more interesting, in a ghoulish sense. Katherine Keener is always a marvel, and her under-stated portrayal of the great though non-prolific perfectionist Harper Lee was great to see. Chris Cooper is always good. To be true to my own feelings about this film, i didn't enjoy it. And i didn't think Hoffman was better than Heath Ledger. Not by a mile. Capote is on television now and i may or may not watch it again. I don't really want to. The questions as to why both Harper Lee and Truman Capote never topped their original and/or only works aren't compelling enough for me to care, just based on this film. Judging from it's accolades as a film and the awards for Hoffman's performance, i could be the only person on the planet who has watched this film that didn't like it. Oddly enough, the supporting characters peaked my interest more than the central character. And as i have already said, i am a huge fan of Mr. Hoffman. But not here. i watched this film last year and had difficulty with being motivated enough to even make a comment about it.... *check out the OTHER Capote film, INFAMOUS",5,5,8,1 February 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," 'she's a notorious sadist..but not in a good way....'
","I thoroughly applaud THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA for several reasons:1) it had what i consider to be a brilliant screenplay with amazing dialogue. 2) MERYL STREEP. nothing more needs to be said here. 3) Emily Blunt. she really did look like she was full of virii, and yet a sympathetic character. 4) Stanley Tucci. He grew on me. What a sweet heart. Like a bitchy version of Hector Elizondo from Pretty Woman.i dare to say that the models in those astounding clothes made America's Next Top Model seem like try-outs for Walmart. Kinda cruel to say, but there it is. Is there any role that the divine Streep cannot do with complete credibility? In this shallow, superficial world of 'fashion', she manages to give a complex and many-layered performance which leaves me without adequate words to describe. Anne Hathaway's character loses her way for a time, and loses herself, although she looked beautiful on the outside in those fabulous clothes. She plays her usual sweet self, which was fine; but i preferred her cold turn in BBM. The people she worked with were twisted and yet very human. And yes; she had a choice. Ultimately, she chooses her own path. The one detail i didn't find convincing was her partnership with Adrian Grenier, who looked like he was trying out for lead actor in a prehistoric film about early man. I didn't buy them as a couple. THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA captured my interest and held it through out right to the end. Yes; it is a ruthless and completely shallow world, but it is peopled with very real humans who have chosen to go along. I've seen these kinds of endings before; but nothing is truly original...except perhaps the absolutely divine Meryl Streep. I watched this film twice, the first time at Waterton Parks, a beautiful place where the highlight was watching this film in it's small theatre amongst the breath taking surrounds. If anyone can upset the brilliant performance by Helen Mirren, it's Meryl. It's not going to happen, but it wouldn't bother me at all if she did. The DVD version had some technical problems with the sound. But it didn't detract from Streep. Not one bit. A stunning performance by one of the best actors of our generation.",10,4,9,1 February 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," a bright, sun-shiny day....
","Little Miss Sunshine is a bright, gentile, sweet-spirited film with an outstanding ensemble cast and a fresh and enchanting screen play by Michael Arndt. I have nothing but respect for Toni Collette, Greg Kinnear, Alan Arkin, and Steve Carell; and Paul Dano, whom i remember from his small stint on THE SOPRANOS, and Abigail Breslin, with such raw and natural talent, are fresh and flawless additions to this amazing mix of actors. Dano spoke volumes about his character with a minimum of words. These characters are flawed, complex, and fully fleshed with idiosyncrasies and quirks that we can relate to, characters we have probably met or perhaps are ourselves, part of the charm of this movie. Alan Arkin left the film all too soon, but he is memorable and likable,like all of the principals in this adventure. i took a road trip across Canada a long time ago in a Volkswagen van, and the landscape and ambiance, the lay of the land, brought back some great memories. The unexpected happens and the good times too. These are real people with intriguing personalities, and the getting there, is most of the fun. There is physical comedy here too, subtle and funny. When they finally arrive at the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant, there are girls dressed in glittery outfits, primped and excited. And yet, i didn't get the feeling that they were being exploited, nor that their dreams of being beauty queens were derided. The twelve little contestants were hilarious, and with the exception of Olive, were already seasoned pros. The MC was hilariously terrifying with his glib parody and terrible singing voice. Dano says, 'i don't want these people judging Olive'. And really, who could disagree with him? but in the end, this was Olive's dream, and she's entitled to them. Olive's dance was a tribute to her grandfather, and a tribute to the sheer joys of life. Shake up the conventional, kids. Put that fly in the ointment. Little Miss Sunshine is an absolute joy. We can all get behind a dream, and the dreams of our loved ones. We don't always have to win, as long as we enjoy the journey. And if we keep our individuality and our sincerity, then, we are winners. i loved this film. Proust, nihilism, brilliance, support, and joy...i have to admire how Dayton, Feris and Arndt mixed that concoction together in such fine fashion. warning*** if you think you are 'normal' and that there is no dysfunction in your family; if you prefer big-budget action films;if you have LITTLE MAN, THE ANIMAL, and WHITE CHICKS in your DVD library; if small films which succeed despite everything doesn't interest you; or if you are mildly offended by subtle smarts, and familiar themes even when performed and produced exceptionally well, all of this is OK. For me, this is the message i received from this wonderful film. Be your glorious self. Life is a wild ride. I'm guessing this film wins best original screenplay at most of the awards this season. brace yourself, because Abigail has a shot here too, along with the venerable Alan Arkin...actually, simply a great ensemble cast.",10,16,23,19 December 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," love, actually
","this is one of the funnier films i've seen. it had it's crude moments, but they were full of charm. it's Altmanesque screenplay, brilliant physical humour, and relaxed friendships were a pleasure to watch, and a slice of life most of us can relate to. and i can say with a measure of honesty that i was afraid for Steve Carell's nipple..i truly was. surprisingly, this is a good-natured, unabashed comedy that is essentially about love, and the many relationships we may find ourselves in along the way. Catherine Keener was terrific as Trish, and all of Steve Carell's friends were flawed but amiable, and so much fun. the idea that they suspected that Carell was a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a forty-year old virgin. but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first. original, charming, and very funny. highly recommended.",9,76,110,15 December 2005
Alien vs. Predator," animals vs dickheads with braids
","i know it's a little late to be commenting on this film but i am compelled to say that this is the most morally depraved, reprehensible film i have seen in a long time. i have no issues with the production values or fx, but this film suggests that we should be siding with a PREDATOR that enslaves other species, sets themselves up as gods, requires sacrifice, and 'hunts' with honour. this film makes Jason and Freddie seem like regular folks. at least with them there is no pretense of honourable conduct. i pity the actors in this film, some of whom are classically trained and have done some good works in the past. children and people with the minds of children are going to be watching this film, readily available for rent and purchase anywhere. so it's OK to enslave other species for our entertainment, expect sacrifices, set yourself up as gods, and kill as a rite of passage or sport or culture. i didn't notice any predator eating their prey but they did take trophies. i sided with the ALIENS in this pathetic film. as dangerous as they were, they were victims. their queen was chained up and frozen. they were expatriated against their will. it reminds me of what some people do around here, shooting, albeit less dangerous animals inside enclosures where they have almost no hope of escaping. anybody who watched and enjoyed this film certainly aren't people i want to befriend. i voted this film as the worst of 2004 at the razzies. it didn't win, but it certainly did with me. this film should have an 18+ rating. Klingons have honour. these predators are like the worst of mankind. the only thing superior about these creatures was their technology. shame on the director, shame on the writers, and shame on the producers of this pathetic excuse for a movie, clearly showing that technological development doesn't necessarily coincide with any moral development. an offensive piece of garbage all around.",1,21,40,3 October 2005
Batman Begins," is that really you, Gary???
","so do i think this is the best batman yet? well, this film provided me with some surprises:1) some of the best shots of the 'city' i've seen, rivaling BLADE RUNNER, which for me is saying a lot.2) Bruce Wayne actually smiled once or twice. after the first hour or so, i didn't think he was going to (great smile, Mr. Bale!). 3) an area 51-ish explanation of batman's technology! 4) another Liam mentor role but with questionable ethics! Has he Ever played a villain before?and the biggest surprise of all: 5) a normal Gary Oldman!to blame ms Holmes' relationship with Tom Cruise as having a negative impact on this film is ludicrous. Leave her alone. now, her character as a taser-wielding district attorney of Gotham is something else altogether. how does she find the time DA'-ing between cheer-leading practice? what this film lacked that the original one with Keaton didn't was a strong villain. but then few can do it like Jack can. Tom Wilkinson, arguably an actor with the greatest range of all working actors today, left the film all too early. i loved his performance and missed him when his character exited the film. the ever great Michael Caine was also good to see and i think his character picked up steam as it went along. and the screen play? this is the person who gave us Memento? At least he was true to the original comic books. sorry if Scorsese beat you to the punch with a Howard Hughes biopic. this film did a good job of demonstrating why Bruce Wayne became the 'bat' he was. but humour of any sort (intentional) was largely missing here. i didn't expect a comedy, don't get me wrong. but the Bruce Wayne character was so serious! have a little fun flying around why don't you... i didn't enjoy this version as much as the first one, although i think this latest one was better constructed. the filming and art direction were simply great, and Christian Bale makes a Great bat, arguably the best one so far. will i miss Katie Holmes in the next one? ah, NO. her credibility as a DA was non-existent. it was good to see Ken Watanabe again too. funny how there's a link here with Tom Cruise. will i watch this film again? absolutely! it was good in many respects, but if someone asked me what it was about, i don't think i could tell them much other than the obvious. i suspect that this film will resurrect the Batman franchise, which is a good thing. a great thing, actually. now that this superbly produced film has set the grounds for cave-dwellers who were unfamiliar with Bruce Wayne's background, the next one has everything going for it.",8,4,6,25 October 2005
X-Men: The Last Stand," they don't need curing, baby
","i watched x men 3, three times. i really really wanted to like this film. instead, i was bored. all three times. although the larger premise of modern medicine, where most of the time the cure is no cure, not needed, and does more harm than any kind of good, even this message is lost in a morass of sheer dis-involvement. but, i will say this...and this is a BIG spoiler so stop reading if you don't want to know....i almost always stay to read the entire list of credits, and what i found, to my delight, is, that once again, the dead aren't always dead. next time i watch this film, i'm going to drink an entire bottle of Cabernet by myself first. it may make a difference.",5,6,8,10 October 2006
The Illusionist," now you tree it, now you don't....'
","i always enjoy Rufus Sewell in a film. He doesn't always play 'the bad guy', but once again he isn't exactly Santa Claus here, as crown prince Leopold. There was a Leopold about that time, uncle and father-in-law to the future Queen Victoria, but this Leopold is fictitious, i'm sure. Paul Giamatti is also very good and unrecognizable from his role in SIDEWAYS. His character is intelligent, complex, and has virtue. Edward Norton is an extremely versatile and gifted actor, and for the most part, he is up to the challenge here, as a rather morose 'illusionist' deprived of the love of his life based on his lower class background. Mess with him, mess with his powers, which, by the way, makes Harry Potter look like an amateur. the film swirls like random yet seamless time and truly does have a magical quality to it. Burger does this with heavy use of dark tones, creepy music, and elusive visions. There is a narrative going on in the background as well, lending to the rather dark ambiance of this film. This film is a blend of gender and governmental politics, vengeance, jealousy, forbidden love, heart break, amazement, a puzzle-necklace of love, and mystery. Norton's character has seeming powers which threaten the ruling class, and even the normalcy of the times. Of course, these things are often not allowed, regardless of which time in history it may be. It isn't a good idea to accuse a crown prince of murder.And yet, 'magicians' have a right to their secrets, do they not? Eisenheim does his best to convince the crowds that his feats are simply illusions, tricks, magic. But the crowds are not convinced, and nor was i. That old man by the tree when Eisenheim was a child gave him something, an invisible yet tangible gift. How he uses that gift is the driving force of this film. It's an intriguing and interesting ride. Personally, i would run from this character's magic....Paul's character, the chief inspector Uhl, says to Eisenheim, not wanting to arrest him, 'you cant bring down the monarchy'. Somehow i don't believe Oliver Cromwell would have agreed with that; nor the Bolsheviks.... Eisenheim's final act on stage is something to behold. I found this film somewhat difficult, and it requires some emotional energy to watch. But it was worth the watch. It is a well-crafted film with a seamless sense of time and action. Very good, although, if you're feeling depressed, i'd save it for another time....even with the 'usual suspects' kinda 'happy' ending....",9,5,9,10 January 2007
Children of Men," homeland security
","so; this is the future then? it begins with the death of the youngest person in the world, barely eighteen years old. All around is a Ludite nightmare. It is a bleak world, with bombs going off, littered streets, gun fire, the presence of armed soldiers and resistance fighters. yes, the future. Governments and the media cast labels on characters as terrorists. It is illegal to avoid fertility testing. Schools, although not needed in this future, are in terrible shape. There are propaganda signs everywhere...'illegal' aliens are rounded up and detained. hmmm.... And yet in this dour world, the music of the Beatles, Stones, King Crimson,and Donovan lives on. There is graffiti every where, and yet there is also Guernica, colourful murals, and a beautiful country side full of plants and flowers. Animals are everywhere: cats, lots of dogs, sheep, deer, a zebra, horses, birds...some horribly exploited; others tenderly loved.... the most beautiful shot in the film for me was when Kee exposes her pregnant body, while modestly covering her breasts. She was beautiful, as all pregnant women are, with her swollen belly filled with so much promise. And life. It is described as 'a miracle', since in this film, everyone is sterile. Since when has pregnancy and birth not been a miracle? it always was, is, and will be, regardless of the circumstance. Children of Men had some ugly things for sure, but it also had redeeming and wonderful things too, things like courage, self-sacrifice, nurturing, love. It had grief and sorrow, joy and happiness; desperation and commitment. It had a great ensemble cast, some of whom left all too soon. It also showed, that men who go to war don't sign up to kill children. I'd have to say that the biggest difference in this 'future' world, is the lack of fresh paint and wall paper. they seem to be replaced by posters and newspaper article's with ominous words on them. i cant rate this film. It has brilliant moments, and yet it is left incomplete and has some plot issues. All i can say is, i am going to wait a while before i watch this again. It is an emotional exercise. In fact, it flexes quite a few emotions. I am a fan of Cuaron's films. He is flexible in his choices, and he takes chances. Children of Men is an important film about a terrible future (??). The sterile thing seems like a pretense for a film that is really about things which are happening to us now. I think we are better off watching this film, than not. It is a film which stays with you. ensemble cast: A; special kudos to Michael Caine cinematography: A+ art direction: A screen play A-",9,12,24,15 January 2007
World Trade Center," oliver tones it down centre
","well; maybe Mr stone feels somewhat humbled by his big budget mess, Alexander, but here we have a toned down (for Mr stone) made for TV film about the WORLD TRADE CENTRE on that fateful day on sept 11. this film appears to be receiving very good reviews, and i admit that it's hard to criticize this film, because of it's fine production values and technical work.the cinematography, the sounds and sound editing were very good. for me, the performances by the women, two of my favorite actors, Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal, is what made this film bearable. it was great seeing Patty d'Arbanville again too, although she had precious little to do in the show. we have seen this before; the women, waiting, hoping, anguished, to hear anything about their loved ones and their men....it is done superbly here, and very much what it must have been like for everyone; not really sure about what was happening; what to do or what to think. this aspect of the film was crafted and performed very well. Nicolas Cage was amazingly believable and subdued. but then, when you are trapped below a ton of rubble and can barely speak, this seems logical. it was great seeing Michael Pena, from CRASH again too. but ultimately, i found this film claustrophobic (albeit much less so than the officers caught below!)dull, and one-toned. except for the vision Pena sees of a Christ figure with a bottle of water, this film seemed like a well-done Sunday made for television effort. i wouldn't pay to see this again, although perhaps it will translate better on the small screen. i give oliver credit for doing his homework and bringing this film down to a microcosm and story of two courageous survivors and their families. it was also tasteful that he didn't graphically show us what the world saw again and again on that day. the film did a fair job of recreating what it must have been like for the police and the fire-fighters, and the hawk marine, at ground zero, through their eyes, which were full of horror, sorrow,and disbelief. having said that, i wouldn't recommend that anyone rush to this film. it seemed by the numbers, regardless of how well it was done. i would rather have seen an oliver stone film about such a controversial and pivotal event in global politics with the flair that is oliver stone. i would say, put Alexander away and sock it to us. was this film 'controversial'? no way. But, that can be a good thing sometimes. *ok. i watched it again on DVD and liked it better the second time...",7,7,15,15 August 2006
Invincible," male bonding
","Despite Mark Wahlberg's reputation as a person, i am a fan of his films and his work, and he didn't disappoint me in Invincible. The film had a way of bringing my age home, since i remember Vince Papale, how bad the Eagles were, Dick Vermeil and of course, the infamous Tom Landry, so this film was nostalgic for me. I recall the music of that time too, and, thankfully, i didn't notice any disco. I expected to see an inspiring football film, and for the most part, it was. But it had something else i really wasn't expecting, which for me was the essence of this film, and that was, camaraderie, support, atmosphere, and friendship. I was happy to see Michael Kelly too, the seeming A**h** who turned out to be a courageous, self-sacrificing guy in Dawn of the Dead (remake).I am not a fan at all of Ericson Core's other projects, with the exception of The Fast and the Furious, and i noticed that he was the cinematographer as well as the directer here. He did a good job. There were certain touches which i appreciated, such as the sequence where Vince was driving around trying to find some inspiration. He saw a young boy playing football with his number, 83, taped on his back; and he saw his friends playing football in the mud, a long-held tradition amid the backdrop of unemployment, strikes, and hard times in a working class city with gutsy people. One could argue that yes, this film was very formulaic. But the film was 'inspired' by a real person; a son of Philadelphia; the city's biggest fan. I feel the film could have used another five minutes or so at the end, for a less abrupt denouement; but perhaps it was because Invincible was about courage, determination, the American dream, family and friends. Those aspects came through very well, even in spite of Papale's life-long struggles with self confidence and esteem. I'd recommend this film for most people. Not just football fans.",8,10,11,26 August 2006
The Departed," the deratted
","i would be lying if i said i understood this film the first time i saw it. and; i would be lying again if i said i understood it much better the second time around, although the message was clear from the beginning. i can only tell you this:1)the score was familiar. Scorsese loves the stones. there were some great Irish tunes as well, and lots of the incomparable Patsy Cline, and the original music by Howard Shore was very good. 2) this was a dream ensemble cast. why Nicholson, Damon, and Di Caprio were overlooked is beyond me. Finally, some recognition for Mark Wahlberg, 3)the editing, particularly the sound editing, was phenomenal. kudos to the entire sound department. it reminded me of the work by the late great Akira Kurosawa, in RAN....well, maybe not quite THAT good, but good... 4) the production values were second to none. 5) the complexity of this screenplay, quite frankly, is brilliant.Very much like last year's CRASH, but in a much much different way, Scorsese shows us that good and bad intertwine like the precision of a spider's web. After a while, i couldn't tell who was good and who was bad. Nobody was good. And a mass murderer could appreciate opera and the ironies of life. This was the point in the film. and it was relentless. The satisfaction of the last scene, when the awol Dignam (Wahlberg)shows himself, was perfection. Even after having lauded this film for it's many areas of pure perfection, it doesn't mean that i particularly enjoyed it. But it was brilliant craft. This is finally Scorsese's year. Best Director is his, despite the very real argument that Clint Eastwood's Letters from Iwo Jima was better directed. If you haven't seen Infernal Affairs, i recommend you give it a watch.Scum on any surface tends to collect in one mass over time. But life thrives, even in a cesspool.",10,7,13,14 February 2007
The Holiday," The Guess What Day
","When i see the names Jude Law, Jack Black, Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz in the cast, i'm likely going to see the film. Nancy Meyers is a writer first, and i enjoyed Baby Boom, so i went hoping for the best. Although there were no surprises in this boy)s) meets girl(s)film, it was a charming piece brightened by the performances by all four principals. i especially enjoyed Kate Winslet, who woke up air-rocking to the music in the morning, and Jack Black playing that theme-song game in the video store which i have done myself many times for a lark. Jude Law was a great love interest, this time not an AI love droid, nor an assassin, sniper, sky captain, paraplegic, rich playboy, cad...he has a surprise about his life sure, but a normal one, and a sweet one to boot. Oh, and the wonderful Eli Wallach; he was simply a joy to see in this film. Nobody ran away from love, at least not true love. The characters were running from relationships which weren't reciprocated nor appreciated, only to run in to the love of their lives while on the run. Not particularly inventive, but charming and satisfying all the same. Is it a date movie? yes. Is it a deep film with deep meaning? nope. Is it a pop-corny movie? yup. nothing wrong with that. A very charming, sweet-natured film.",9,14,26,27 December 2006
War of the Worlds," war? of the worlds?
","i hear that the video of WAR OF THE WORLDS is being released this week. this is what reminded me that i saw this film in the theatres. i went to a matinée because i didn't want to wait for the evening show. this is why i gave it six stars: * the space ships. of course, they've had fifty-plus years to improve on the original, but those ships were impressive. like metal versions of the floating martians from Invasion From Mars only much bigger. * the cameo by Gene Barry. * that flaming train. * that great paranoid turn by Tim Robbins * the sound editing and sound effects * my appreciation for Steven Spielberg and his great resume of films.someone should remind Dakota Fanning's agent about the word, 'over- exposure'. she's a kid. she deserves a life. i wanted to see more of Miranda Otto but no such luck. so the alien ships were underground all this time,..fine. i'll probably watch this movie again to see how it translates from the big screen to television. but i intend to read, talk on the phone, and check my emails at the same time. was Spielberg looking forward to making Munich while he was working on this movie? sometimes sports teams do that, looking forward to that big game and forgetting they have to deal with another team first. i've run out of things to say about this film. and yes, i preferred the original. one last positive about this 'remake'. it could have been much worse. footnote: OK. i watched it again on DVD. for such a technologically advanced alien species they sure didn't think things through, did they...ps: rather than pause the DVD or tape, go to the john when father and son are fighting, the true war of this worlds.",6,4,8,16 November 2005
Wedding Crashers," nice m.o's
","there is an easy rapport between Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, and of course there's the wonderful Chris Walken and Rachael McAdams. and seeing Jane Seymour playing against type from her Dr Quinn, medicine virgin was a nice change. i wanted to like this film and watched it twice. i wonder if Vince put on extra weight for the role, the way Renee and Robert and George did.... i would venture to say that the beginning was less predictable than the end. and despite their pick-up modus operandi, the two characters were fairly likable characters. and i'm probably going to watch this again, except to see it win at the People's Choice awards...Vince and Owen's characters are such cads, but they are such likable ones, and they made me chuckle. That's more than enough.",7,8,12,16 January 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," sith it?
","this film has some wonderful aspects. 1) the technicians involved in the movie, all of them did a great job. the sound, sound editing, score, cinematography, fx, film editing, et al. if there were no dialogue, just watching this film is a great experience. 2) the art direction was spectacular. the worlds they created, make-up and sets, costuming and design, creatures they designed, were truly great. and the choreography of the fights were exceptional. i loved watching Yoda decapitate those guards before they knew what hit them, and the individual battles between Anakin and Obi-won, Yoda and Palpatine, Windu and Palpatine, were athletic and convincing. and general Grievous, an android with a respiratory condition, intriguing! 3)Ian Mcdiarmid did a great job as the evil emperor. although i suspected he was the villain when he first appeared in the earlier films, his performance was great to watch. 4)character and emotion was prime here. jealousy, greed, love, remorse, sacrifice, betrayal, ruthlessness, loyalty, deception, hope, courage, despair and grief, emotions and their nature were easy to relate to.my heart isn't in to criticizing this film. all i'll say is that Natalie Portman, clearly a great actor in films such as Cold Mountain (she surprised me. i thought she was better than granny clampett and ms ice cold), Closer, Garden State, and Hayden Christensen, were more convincing as lovers when they were in scenes apart. i didn't feel any true chemistry between them when they were on the screen together. but George had both of them ask about the other when they regained their consciousness, and i found that very moving. it's something watching the powerful influence of love help turn Anakin into a monster,his motivation being to save his beloved Padme, a compelling reason, and in the end knowing that love brought him back. his fall from grace was total and complete. i'll also admit that when i first watched this when it was released, i cried. and i cried again when i re-watched it on DVD, although it wasn't because of the acting or the screenplay.( we all knew padme was doomed. oddly enough, it also made me laugh out loud) but i think this was in large part because i have watched all the movies in this franchise. in the end it is a classic story of good against evil, and love between a man and a woman, and a story about an exceptional family. Revenge of the Sith helped make the first Star Wars seem even better, because we know more (and because the first one was a better movie, but i digress...) wasn't this the true lure of the last film in this series? to find out what the deal was with Darth Vader? i suspected as much when i watched his transformation, but it didn't disappoint me. this wasn't a perfect film(uh, have you considered letting someone else write the screenplay, George?) but it was in it's way truly remarkable. and the moving score helped bandage the film together. i'm happy to have seen it more than once and will definitely watch it again. actually i believe it helped make all the films in this series seem better,(not an easy thing when you're talking about 'clones' and 'phantom') and Anakin's redemption in 'return' all the more touching. yes indeed, there is such a thing as redemption, and this film reminded me to think twice before judging the character of a man. which reminds me..thank you Mr Lucas, for your visionary Star Wars. Is it really over? NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!",10,6,12,2 November 2005
The Queen," fourteen points
","i've had a few days to think about THE QUEEN, and i say without shame that this is a perfectly constructed film with the necessary bonus of a great ensemble cast. This has got to be the great, Helen Mirren's year, in spite of everything. She has now recreated both ElizabethR's, and does it like nobody else. Watching the solid and versatile James Cromwell playing her idiot, cousin-husband was also very good; and i mean no offense to staunch royalists. British history and particularly it's ancient monarchy is one of my passions, so i waited for the films' release with anticipation. It was a true treat seeing Ms Sylvia Syms playing the queen mum. There are brief comments made about the royal family which are less than complimentary but true. But Mr Frears doesn't dwell on them, points out Elizabeth's devotion to her country and to her tradition, without hitting us over the head with it. I loved his film, THE GRIFTERS. THE QUEEN is equally as good. Some of my fellow film fans feel that the magnificent stag, so relentlessly hunted for it's fourteen points, represented Diana. For me, it represented the entire royal family, and especially the Queen. I loved the opening quotation assessed to Henry 4, who basically usurped the throne from family with a better claim: 'uneasy is the head that wears the crown', or something close to that, For him, it was. But he did his fair share of back stabbing himself to retain power. The scene with Helen and Sylvia consulting about what to do was especially powerful. it's quite true that Elizabeth is descended from a long, unbroken line which precedes the Norman conquest. As queen, she has, imo, done everything she can and more to fulfill her obligations and her birth right, putting her country before anything else. The weak and ineffectual Charles wasn't man enough to marry the woman he loved. Some may argue that he was doing 'his duty', but if he was, he destroyed a few lives along the way. And i do believe that yes indeed, he would let his mother take a bullet for him. Not nice to say, and perhaps a tad unfair. Elizabeth, on the other hand, threatened to abdicate as heir presumptive if she couldn't marry Phillip. Then there are the references to George the sixth's demise, from the stress of being King when he wasn't up to it, nor groomed for it. Well, other Kings had older brothers die,such as his own father; one was even passed over in favour of a younger one; others seized it. I think his excessive smoking and depleted immune system from generations of cousin-marrying probably didn't help, since he died from emphysema. or so we're told. But i admired him, and i adored his wife, the late Queen Consort Elizabeth. Don't get me wrong; i really feel no moral criticism about cousins marrying; but i do believe in hybrid vitality. And then there's the Hapsburgs! Her relationship with Tony Blair was believable and quite likely very close to the truth. I do believe i recently watched Mr. Sheen portray the insane emperor Nero... This is a glorious, tasteful film with an unbelievable performance by Helen Mirren. It may not be everybody's 'cup of tea', but it is a gem. *I wish i could have had a better look at those portraits hanging behind The Queen. There were her grandparents, her great grandparents, and Victoria, i believe, who was her great great great grandmother...spectacular collection of art and portraits...some were cut off at the waist, headless..like that magnificent stag....",10,14,21,14 November 2006
Casino Royale," royale flush
","this film began with what i consider to be the most insipid, forgettable bond song, and a villain with a SCAR. o no. but this guy weeps blood no less. a variation on a cliché. bond begins by chasing an incredibly fast, dexterous guy for no apparent reason. and of course, there's the crane scene. o no. but then, the film begins to get better. and better. and with the arrival of the exquisite Eva Green, even better. M is great as usual, although, if this was the start of Bond's career, M looks older. beautiful, but older. the poker scenes surprised me a bit but were lacking in suspense. When Bond tells Vesper he loves her, and resigns, we all know then what's in store for her. the question is, how does she die? it was a touching moment seeing Bond in love, almost leaving it all, and the sacrifices made all around. but, besides getting her out of that sinking cage, he didn't seem to try very hard to revive her (think, THE ABYSS). i would have kept trying. i can say this: Daniel Craig has a great body; Eva Green is as beautiful as ever; Judy Dench is a wonderful M; it's great seeing Giancarlo Giannini again, although his role in the film just didn't ring true; Le Chiffre is worse than creepy.... the most touching moments come at the end, when we discover the extent of Vesper Lynd's predicament and the sacrifices she made. and oddly enough, it set a ground work for why Bond so often loves them and leaves them.... This Bond had a great ensemble cast, some great action sequences, and a vaguely bland screen play. but i'd watch it again. after all, it IS Bond....James Bond....and Daniel Craig? this Bond, can ACT and act well. This wont necessarily make him my favorite Bond, but he is very very good here.",8,6,10,19 December 2006
Cloud Atlas," We are all connected......
","Cloud Atlas, is the only brilliant film I've seen this year. Watching this was a spiritual experience, and fulfilled everything I expect from a film. Jim Broadbent, Bae Doona, Ben Whishaw, the entire ensemble, give some of the very best performances this year. The editing, art direction, cinematography, and the rest of that fabulous tech team, do a stellar job. In fact, imo, Broadbent gives the best performance of the year.His scenes with Whishaw are easily the best I've seen all year.Compare this to what AMPAS has given us this year as Best Picture, and I can only shake my head at how easily herded voters are. Tom Tykwer and the Wachowski brothers continue to astound this viewer, with their creativity, daring, and courage. Hollywood, they're not. And thank gawd for that.Highly recommended.",10,1,3,1 February 2013
Fantastic Four," fantastic bore
","this film did a fairly good job of describing the origins of the fantastic four. but i say that without ever having read any of the comics. there was some pathos with the Thing when his fiancée rejected him. he's the same guy as he always was, he claims. so what if he only has four fingers and looks like he's plastered in cookie dough? the flaming guy, the Human Torch, was fun to watch. good thing he had no nerve endings. good skier though. Elastic Man was benign enough and fairly non-descript. the big surprise here for me was Invisible Girl. i didn't know that Jessica Alba could put in such a horrible performance. she acted more like a junior exec trying to plan an office party than someone undergoing an amazing transformation. she's very pretty, but in this film it's too bad she wasn't invisible the entire time. i watched this film twice trying to give it the benefit of the doubt. if the producers and Tim Story were merely trying to lay the ground work for a sequel, fine. but if the ground work has a shaky foundation i'm not sure a lot of people would go rushing in to the building. i'm sure people of all ages enjoyed this movie but if i were pressed i'd say the biggest demographic are 10-14yr old boys. nothing wrong with that i guess.",5,12,21,9 December 2005
Click," yick
","well, i just watched Click win best comedy at the People's Choice, and it reminded me that ya, i did see this film. What can i say? i FORGOT about this movie. It's not that i don't appreciate Adam Sandler. He can be hilarious and he is what he is. He showed his range in Punch Drunk Love, and he was hilarious in The Wedding Singer, imo. Plus, generally, he's a likable guy playing fairly likable characters. Click is not what i consider to be even, an average film. It's not good. It's not a comedy and it's not a credible drama. In fact, the closest i came to laughing is at the end, when Adam is moaning and groaning on the road, more from his short-sighted decisions and shallow screen play than any physical damage. It's one big cliché with meaningless dialogue and predictable turns at every corner. When this airs on the networks, i wont be watching it. Once was enough. This is quite a shame, when you look at the cast and even the director. I was disinterested, and even more disappointed than i was afraid i was going to be. This movie didn't really need to be made. We've seen it before, many many times; and done much better as well. I suppose it may appeal to some demographic; i wasn't on that list. And the trailers? A bit misleading, but all you really need to see. i don't blame Sandler for this; it's the simply indescribable 'screen play', written on toilet paper by someone who may not be able to vote yet, not meaning any disrespect to children, of course. the TWILIGHT ZONE's by Rod Serling in the fifties, who took at look at this premise, were better and more creative than this film.",4,9,21,9 January 2007
Cinderella Man," phone-throwing man
","it's difficult for me to make a well-informed assessment of this biopic about James Braddock, because i wasn't there. i'm an ardent history buff though, and i know something about the 'dirty thirties' from anecdotes and text books.this was beautifully crafted with it's sepia tones and shadowed images, the presence of radios and the poverty that was so much a part of the decade. what powered this film was the great performance by Russell Crowe. if indeed Mr Braddock had this kind of class, Russell brought it forward with his toned down, self-effacing yet proud countenance. and once again, Paul Giamatti was terrific as his manager. Paul is always great and i'd love to see him get acknowledgment for his body of work. Renee Zellweger was OK too, surprisingly credible with black hair. i didn't watch any of Max Baer's fights, and i know nothing about him other than he was world champion and his son was Jethro on the BH's. but i can understand why his family would take exception to his portrayal as a man who enjoyed womanizing, was disrespectful of women and basically everyone, and relished killing people in the ring. did he? was he? one thing i've noticed about Ron Howard is how he glosses over things. he's all Hollywood, and really who can blame him? he grew up in it's milieu. he's no Fernando Meirelles or Terrance Malick and he doesn't pretend to be. Mr Howard likes to entertain, and he's such an amiable fellow, hard to resist. all in all, this is a better-than-average boxing movie about a gracious, classy, humble man who loved his family and represented the little guy who could. Quite a Stretch for Russell. not in the same league as Raging Bull (what is?)nor Million Dollar Baby, about as good as Somebody Up There Likes Me, better than the Rockies and Ali. i'd recommend it, for the performances, and the look and feel of the thirties. even though i knew how it ended, i still found myself cheering.",8,8,11,9 December 2005
Evil Dead II," rosebud
","this is by far, the scariest movie i have ever seen. and it even made me laugh. i saw this a very long time ago, in the theatres, and i had never heard of Sam Raimi at the time. this film is an example of what you can do with a bit of money and a brilliant mind. using cameras, sound,editing and anticipation, what we have here is an engrossing, raw horror movie with a uniquely charming eternal champion. and i loved the special effects, which includes his use of sound and camera work. they weren't up to the block-buster digital computerized seamless stuff we see now, but for me this only added to its' charm. the film also didn't take itself too seriously either, which is always appreciated. i really like the character of Ash, and his progression from ordinary guy to cocky, evil dead fighter. as for Sam Raimi, it didn't take long to see just how gifted he is as a director, and i couldn't wait to see what he could do with a bigger budget. i think his track record now speaks for itself. this is a hard-core, for horror fans movie. i'm only guessing but i think baby-boomers who want to be scared will love this film. i also like seeing Bruce Campbell show up in Raimi films, like the face in the crowd in the last shot in Dark Man, right on up to his television shows and the power-tripping gate-keeper in Spider Man 2. He uses his brother in his films too,(aarrgh Henrietta!) nice to see, as well as seeing his partner's wife in cameos in his other films( great punk look, xena). i understand that Bridget Fonda asked Sam to give her a small role in Army of Darkness because she is such a fan of the movies, and probably of Mr Raimi as well, whom she worked with in A Simple Plan. great film. my understanding is that he has written the screenplay for an Evil Dead 4. this is great news to me, and makes sense considering how Army of Darkness ended. Army didn't scare me, but i loved it all the same. i don't know what to expect from a fourth one....scarier than hell or campy fun, or both? i say, bring it on! he wont have any trouble getting real money for #4, which he didn't need in the first three to make them so truly great. so, trust me on this. if you love horror films, check out Evil Dead 2, dead by dawn. i wouldn't watch it alone either. i don't care how macho you are. it's an engaging roller-coaster,fun ride. not for the uninitiated and not for Sleepless in Seattle-type fans. this is pure, classic, camp with a great ending.",10,12,15,16 October 2005
The Island," so tell us what you REALLY think
","Michael Bay could be one of the worst, big-budget directors in the history of film, although he showed promise in his early years with some of his television work. never what i would consider a 'deep' guy, and ignoring history quite a bit, i was somewhat surprised by The Island. yes, it was over-blown, unsubtle, and a mixed genre. but this time, Mr. Bay has something important to say. he's clearly made up his mind about this subject matter, but this is still a departure for a guy who always seems to manage to get investors for his crappy films. and an audience too. let's see, what does Mr Bay see in this bleaker (i didn't think it was possible), sadder theme of Brave New World , Blade Runner, and 1984? 1)clones have souls. 2)the populace can be and are easily brain-scrubbed 3)the medical establishment will do anything for money 4)Sean Bean is used to being killed in his movie roles. Steven Buscemi too; always a joy to watch him. 5)the strength of the 'human' spirit shouldn't be underestimated. 6)we don't really know what life is, how life is defined 7)Scarlett Johansson has a strong grip and is no wimp 8)Mr Bay doesn't go anywhere without his hammer 9)the question of bio-ethics could be the biggest oxymoron there isthis is a bleak, nightmarish vision of the future gone horribly wrong. it is a picture of extremes with those who have and those who have not, and that we can make people believe ANYTHING with enough money, media, and brain-washing (doesnt really sound so sci-fi, does it...). but it is also an action film that people can watch without having to do too much thinking. it is one of Mr Bay's better films, which really isn't saying much. there are many, many plot holes. it's about reaching THE ISLAND, the grand prize, the lottery win, heaven, freedom. like that old adage, be careful what you wish for, because you just might get it.",7,8,12,14 December 2005

","i watch a lot of films, and i don't feel compelled to write about many of them, but TALLADEGA NIGHTS is one i'll get a kick out of writing about! i found this film engrossing, involving, and hilarious. what surprised me the most was the great acting in this comedy! and the list of actors! what a joy: Amy Adams, John c Reilly, Michael Clarke Duncan, Gary Cole; cameos by Elvis Costello and Dale Earnhardt, Pat Hingle, and many others! fabulous. little things about this film made me laugh: the hilarious Sacha Baron Cohen, who really held his own, reading 'l'etranger' while driving; the gold necklaces worn by just about everyone; the jazz planted in the local bar, along with other tunes, as a form of 'profiling';...i truly appreciated the unashamed, sponsorship banners everywhere. tacky ones like Old Spice and Wonder Bread, so many i couldn't name them all! i wasn't disappointed by this film at all, and i'd love to see comedies acknowledged quite a bit more for the acting in them. everyone was perfect. yes, it was slapstick, and it worked. i generally stay to read all of the credits, and i'm glad i did this time. at the very end, Ricky Bobby's kids and their grandmother were sitting on a couch having a philosophical discussion about moral ambiguity and the mores of twenties cinema. i'd recommend this film for most people, not just for the surprisingly superb performances, but for the sense of speed generated, the overwhelming fact that 200,000 fans were in the stands, the great crashes, the driving. and of course the laughs! highly recommended, and not just for Will Ferrell fans! i didn't expect to like it as much as i do. kudos to everyone involved in this movie!",9,7,12,21 August 2006
