Saturday Night Fever," John Travolta's Greatest Film!
","'Saturday Night Fever' in my humble opinion has remained John Travolta's best film to date.  It was his debut lead film role and it has remained an all time favorite of mine.  Travolta plays a character named Tony Manero, who is a 19 year old paint store retailer in Brooklyn.  Tony yearns for a better life and trys to figure out a way to break free from his dead end friends and parents.  He knows he's capable of doing more with his life than he has.  Tony is a remarkable dancer and he shows everyone this at the 2001 Odyssey Disco, every Saturday night.  Then he meets Stephanie, a maturing young woman who is trying to improve her life with education and interest in her career. She also enjoys dancing, so Stephanie and Tony decide to become dance partners.  The story follows the two becoming friends, falling in love and Tony's maturation.  John Travolta couldn't be bettered in the role of Tony Manero.  His character is outwardly cool and tough, but inside there is a lot of tenderness and caring.  Travolta is an excellent dancer and he proves this as he glides onto the dance floor and gyrates to the Bee Gees pulsating soundtrack. The supporting cast is first rate too.  This is definitely a 1970's classic that shouldn't be missed by any connoisseur of film.",10,5,6,20 September 2001
