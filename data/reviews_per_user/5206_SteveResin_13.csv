Child 44," A Massive Disappointment & Wasted Opportunity
","I was really looking forward to seeing Child 44. Being a fan of the extraordinary Citizen X I was pumped that such a disturbing and riveting story such as Chikatilo's was getting the big budget treatment with a stellar cast.The bubble burst within the first few minutes, as I realised for some god-forsaken reason they'd decided to reinvent the story. The timeframe is completely wrong, the characters have newly invented pasts and worse of all Chikatilo's capture and fate is completely fabricated. Not only do they fail to arrest him and bring him to trial, he's assassinated in a forest by some tiresome agent with a grudge against the detective hunting the killer down. Utterly ridiculous and pointless.Pointless because if ever there was a story that didn't need reinvention to make it more interesting than reality it's this one. Chikatilo's story is so macabre, absurd and fantastical it doesn't need ridiculous embellishments.As for the movie itself, the acting is of a high standard, Hardy and Rapace in particular shine, but the faux-Russian accents of the whole cast are grating and another pointless decision. Why not just have them speak in their own accents, and credit the audience with enough intelligence to realise this is Russia and these are russians we're watching despite the accents.Stick with Citizen X, it's far superior and more rewarding.",4,56,93,29 July 2015
Inglourious Basterds," Bland, Meandering Nonsense
","In the early part of his career Tarantino gave the world some excellent films, Pulp Fiction arguably being his masterpiece. Unfortunately it's been downhill ever since. Inglorious Basterds ('Chortle! He's put the word basterds in the title! ZOMG!') is on a par with Death Proof in being his low point. The film could have been infinitely more interesting had it just focused on Brad Pitt's squad of vengeful Jewish soldiers shooting and clubbing their way through Europe taking out prominent SS ne'er-do-well's, but sadly we have to endure a ridiculous and tedious story of Hitler and the Nazi top brass attending a screening of a pro-Nazi film in downtown Paris, enabling the Basterds and a few uninteresting partisans to devise a plot to eliminate them in one fell swoop. It's aesthetically pleasing no doubt, but sadly falls victim to Quentin's 'trademark', that is to fill huge parts of the movie with meandering dialogue that adds little to the experience. The film could easily have been trimmed down to around 90 minutes without all the yadder yadder and would have improved vastly for it. The cast do their jobs well enough, save for Brad Pitt who lacks charisma and seems to be doing a Forest Gump impersonation throughout. All in all I probably would have enjoyed this more if I was 14.",4,6,12,27 November 2009
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Star Wars Suicide Squad
","Director Gareth Edwards does a fantastic job with the slimmest of story lines, which consists of the rebel alliance stealing the plans for the Death Star that lead into the original Star Wars, A New Hope.The Good: The cast is excellent, and the new characters are hugely likable. The best of these are Baze and Chirrut, one a badass warrior and the other a blind monk with some serious skills and a love of The Force. I could easily have watched a whole movie featuring just these two as the protagonists. Felicity Jones is believable as Jyn, the daughter of the Death Star's chief architect who joins the rebellion to lead a rag-tag team to retrieve the plans for the Emperor's ultimate weapon. Diego Luna and Riz Ahmed also bring their A Game. The droid K-2SO is also a welcome addition to the crew, a classic Star Wars droid if ever there was one. Ben Mendelsohn is a decent villain, if a little one note, and both Forest Whitaker and Mads Mikkelsen provide good support.The battle scenes are fantastic, possibly the best I've ever seen in the Star Wars universe. Even the smaller street battle scenes are masterful and expertly crafted. The Death Star has never been better or more fearsome. Its destruction of a city is just visually stunning. The space battles are pure old skool Star Wars and full of excitement and tension. There's one scene in particular where a ramming ship pushes one Star Destroyer into another and it just looks incredible. But all this eye candy aside the ultimate scene is towards the end when Darth Vader makes a last ditch attempt to retrieve the stolen plans and takes out a whole squadron of rebels single-handedly in a small corridor, in a scene so badass it will surely become iconic.The Not So Good: There's not much here I didn't enjoy, and it feels harsh ragging on such a great movie, but it wasn't the greatest idea to include a CGI Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin. He just isn't convincing, and it was giving me bad flashbacks to some of the terrible CGI in The Phantom Menace. If they'd used him for one small scene maybe shaded in darkness it could have worked, but he appears in quite a few long scenes and it really takes you out of the moment. Princess Leia looks even worse, and again was there really any need to show a close up of her badly computerized face? Maybe a long distant shot would have worked better. Small complaints though, and they don't spoil an otherwise hugely enjoyable experience.Leia's final words in Rogue One are 'hope'. Well this movie has given me hope, hope that those soul destroying prequels are fading into the ether and the Star Wars franchise is back on track.",8,3,6,11 April 2017
Two for the Money," Superb Acting, Mediocre Storytelling
","The story itself is interesting but nothing special, a yarn about a Vegas college footballer who becomes the prodigy of a New York betting shark, lifted above mediocrity by two superb masterclasses in acting from Al Pacino and Matthew McConaughey. Truth is there's no likable people here, and the cloying, against-all-the-odds ending is in poor taste. But the performances make it worth seeing at least once, Pacino in particular is having a blast as the wise-cracking shark and Matthew McConaughey is no slouch here either. Just a shame the story isn't that captivating, unless betting on football games is your thing.",7,0,0,20 August 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Meh.
","A film of two halves for me. The first half was largely excruciating, with Peter acting like a hyperactive kid who'd OD'd on M&M's. Aunt May as some cougar who Stark wishes was dressed in something 'skimpy', just no. Complete lack of chemistry between Parker and his love interest.The second half was better. Keaton was great once he went full supervillain, Parker was much better once he calmed down after Tony took away the toys. Ned was great. There was still too much CGI for my liking, the stealth plane sequence was so manic and crammed with SFX it just looked like a video game. Watchable but could have been a lot better imo.",6,1,2,25 December 2017
Suicide Squad," Flawed But Not Without Merit
","After reading so many disappointing reviews since its release I watched Suicide Squad with some trepidation, but it wasn't anywhere near as bad as I expected. It's above average, but there's no denying it's flawed and parts of it just don't work at all.Similar to Sin City it's very meta in its approach. It plays up the comic book aesthetic and for me this worked well. It's quite dark with splashes of bright colour that reinforces the Sin City vibe and it looks great.OK, the good - The cast are mostly excellent, particularly Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, Joel Kinnaman and Jay Hernandez. There's a few neat appearances from Affleck as Batman and a short cameo from The Flash which was fun. Will Smith is decent as Deadshot, but his casting took me out of the movie constantly. I always felt I wasn't watching Deadshot, just Will Smith. I found it hard to separate the actor from the character, maybe they should have gone for a less iconic actor in the role. His acting is flawless though. Margot Robbie is flawless too, but I must say the constant gratuitous shots of her backside were over the top. The character was completely sexualized and if they'd reigned this in a little (or a lot if I'm honest) her character could have really been something amazing. It's a little tough to admire her acting chops or the dialogue she's been given when her backside gets top billing. Horny young teens will love it though...Sadly there's a lot of bad. The choice of music is either hugely predictable and tired (Spirit In The Sky anyone?) or just awful. The storyline is wafer thin and the big bad, an ancient and powerful witch called Enchantress has zero backstory which removes any sense of urgency to the threat everyone's up against. Her relationship with Kinnaman is also underdeveloped so why should I care, frankly? The Deadshot and his daughter scenes are largely awful and feel out of place, some of the dialogue is poor and the climactic big fight scene fell short.The most polarizing part of the movie is Jared Leto as The Joker. I've always admired Leto as an actor, he's done some incredible work in the past and had a thankless task following in Heath Ledger's much loved footsteps, but I have to be honest and say it didn't really work for me. He's more like some meth-crazed gangster than The Joker, again his back story with Harley was too short and underdeveloped and his dialogue is largely appalling. I thought Harley had more chemistry with Diablo, which says it all.I rated it a 7. If you can ignore the flaws there's an enjoyable film to be found here, not a classic by any means but certainly has it's moments.",7,6,9,4 December 2016
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," A Complete Success
","What can I say? I was lucky enough to be a kid in the '70s when Ape-mania was at it's peak, due to the continuing Planet Of The Apes movies, the TV series, the comics, the toys... the franchise is so ingrained in my psyche I was completely disheartened when I heard they were making a new Ape movie. I needn't have worried. This film delivers, and it delivers magnificently. The best place to start is with the story, and it was enthralling and captivating, as we watch Caesar's beginnings. To my surprise I found it completely heartbreaking in points, something I didn't truly experience with any of the original films. There are moments that will move even the hardest of hearts, and moments that will enrage. The cast were perfect, with James Franco excellent as the scientist who befriends and rescues Caesar, Brian Cox the wicked animal warden and the imperious John Lithgow as Franco's Althzeimer's addled father. There were some neat nods to the 1967 epic, especially the short but poignant shots of Charleton Heston's doomed mission to Mars. They also appear to have neatly confronted the 'why humans end up mute' question, with the release of a deadly virus. All will be revealed in future sequels I'm sure. Finally then the special effects. All I can say is absolutely staggering. Not for one moment did I feel I was watching a movie filled with cgi apes. Caesar & Maurice in particular are just incredible pieces of computer animation, literally jaw dropping. The sfx are arguably the finest I've seen in any movie, period. That just about sums up my thoughts on this truly astonishing piece of work. From what was a sceptical start I now cannot wait for the next installment.",8,7,14,17 August 2011
I Am Legend," Nowhere Near Legendary
","Sadly, yet again we get an adaptation of I Am Legend that fails to remain faithful to the book and instead panders to audience expectations and demands for happy endings. That's not to say this a bad movie, it's a perfectly decent way to waste a couple of hours. Then again, it's not a truly great movie either, and is definitely a missed opportunity.The good parts start with the set up, which sees a scientist create a virus that is curing people from cancer. Unfortunately it mutates with time and ends up infecting almost everybody on earth, turning them into crazed sun-fearing maniacs. Will Smith seems to be one of the few who are immune and unaffected and spends his days trying to survive in a desolate New York, which looks great on screen with it's empty and litter strewn streets. Smith is largely excellent and his relationship with his faithful dog is a highlight of the film.The bad is the CGI of the infected. They don't look remotely convincing, more akin to something from a video game and are a huge distraction every time they appear. They take you out of the experience because they look so awful.Another major flaw is the decision to completely ignore the book's ending and have Smith discover he's not alone and there is a community of survivors he can join. Happy ending again. This is hugely annoying to fans of the book because the whole point of the title I Am Legend is the realization that he is indeed the last human on earth, and therefore has become an almost mythical creature in the eyes of the infected, who now possess the earth. The fact he survives and discovers others like him totally negates the title of the movie. It should have been called I Am Not Legend.",6,1,2,7 September 2015
Green Street Hooligans," Funnier than a heavy dose of laughing gas
","'Green Street Hooligans' would be a fantastic film were it a comedy. Unfortunately we're supposed to take this lame attempt at documenting the culture of football hooliganism seriously. This film is riddled with clichés. The cultured, well-heeled yank to the 'cockerneys' from 'darn saaff' giving it all 'apples and pears', 'knees up Muvver Braaan!'... Quite why a cultured middle class American midget would be attracted to the bunch of neanderthal morons that make up the football firm is beyond comprehension, they're about as attractive as a particularly nasty dose of clap. The main sentiment of the movie seems to be 'Violence is OK as a means to an end' and 'Journalism is the mother of all evils'. Ridiculous! The characters are so over the top it's more like a Carry-On version of football hooliganism than anything of true merit or worth. They're all here, the Cockerney wide-boy with a heart of gold who sacrifices himself at the movies climax to save his friend, the disillusioned firm member who betrays his mates and redeems himself before the final whistle, the rival firm 'Boss' who is a complete psycho but is misunderstood because hey, you know, he lost his son in a previous fight.. like you do.. there's even room for the 'retired' firm leader, who tries to steer our 'hero' away from the meaningless violence but ultimately ends up 'carved up' for his troubles. I spent about 95 percent of this garbage laughing, as will anyone with an ounce of intelligence. The funniest moment for me though was the scene where 'Bov' or whatever his name is stands on a bench near Tower Bridge clutching a bottle of Smirnoff warbling 'I'm forever blowing bubbles' into the night sky. All the film needed was Simon Cowell to appear and offer some sage advice on his delivery. And to top it all the final 'battle' scene is played out to a MOR American rock ballad. No, seriously... This movie wasn't only badly written, directed and acted, it was out of step with time and reality. It would have made slightly more sense had it been set in the late 1970s or early 1980s. Sure, you'll always get morons fighting at football matches but the culture that this movie spews out died a long time ago, thank God. Awful. But the Yanks will probably love it. 'Knees up Muvver Riley!!!'",1,4,10,3 February 2006
Love & Mercy," Heroes And Villains
","Biopic of Beach Boys genius Brian Wilson, and the struggle to free himself from his shady 'therapist' who had taken complete control over Brian's life & finances. The movie flits back and forth between Brian's descent into mental illness at his creative peak in the mid 60s to the late 80s where he met his current wife who helped free him from his repugnant therapist.Paul Dano is excellent and convincing as young Brian, John Cusack less so as his older troubled self. As expected the music is glorious and it's an interesting look at how fame, wealth and mental illness can impact on a fragile mind, and how empathy and understanding can free that person.",8,2,3,8 September 2015
Kong: Skull Island," Skull Candy
","I thoroughly enjoyed Kong: Skull Island, for a few simple reasons. There's no obligatory romance distracting from the action, the visuals are absolutely stunning, the action is frantic, the characters are likable and the acting is first class. It was such a relief to see an action movie without long, drawn out scenes of pointless exposition or tired romantic tropes. Skull Island just gets down to business from the opening scene and doesn't let up until it's over.The story is simple and not drawn out or blown up into tedious proportions. At the end of the Vietnam War a secret division of the US Government called Monarch discover the location of a mythical island and decide to investigate and map it before the 'Commies' get a chance to after the war ends. After breaking through an almost impenetrable storm that surrounds the place all hell breaks loose, as Kong arrives and wreaks havoc. With limited time until a possible extraction the survivors of the team have to make it to the far end of the island within 3 days, through a perilous jungle of prehistoric and mythical creatures. It's like Jurassic Park on steroids.Samuel L Jackson's character is interesting, at first sight he seems despondent that the Vietnam War is ending. The truth is he doesn't want war to end, he's become obsessed with war and is determined to die a soldier, so his later decision to abandon all sense and hunt Kong down to the detriment of an escape plan fits perfectly with the little we know of him. Tom Hiddleston is great as the tracker, Brie Larson and John Goodman have fun with their roles but the star of the show (Kong aside) is John C Reilly as a WWII pilot marooned on the island since 1945. He's a little stir crazy shall we say, and has some fun quips and an entertaining personality. Even the supporting cast are quite memorable and thankfully not one of them was annoying or incredulous. The SFX are phenomenal. Kong has never looked better. The other creatures are inventive and interesting. It has a fun Vietnam-era soundtrack, and includes a great scene where they fly into the Island Apocalypse Now style with Paranoid by Black Sabbath blasting out of the speakers. That alone tells you this movie is not to be taking seriously, it's just a fun monster movie in the classic Kong and Godzilla mode, sit back and enjoy the fireworks and leave the pathos and hand wringing to other mediums. 8 out of 10 bananas.",8,0,0,25 June 2017
Arrival," Squid Pro Quo
","A slightly above average sci-fi film but nothing more. Aesthetically it's stunning, the acting is first class and I found the aliens and their technology intriguing. Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner are both excellent, with solid support from Forest Whitaker and Michael Stuhlbarg. On the downside the story is a touch pretentious, yearning to be taken seriously. Through terminal illnesses and mathematical and linguistic conundrums it paints itself as something profound and new but in truth is lacking any originality or depth. Disappointingly there's also the usual clichéd sci-fi tropes thrown in, such as Russia and China being portrayed as insensitive and overly aggressive, the disillusioned rogue soldier who attempts to sabotage our heroes' world saving plans, shots of rioting breaking out on news channels around the globe. Yawn.It's a decent film, and worth a viewing if you have any interest in sci-fi, but one I doubt warrants repeated viewing.",7,1,4,5 February 2017
Alien: Covenant," 'That's The Spirit!'
","Go in with low expectations (which is good advice for any film, never mind a prequel to one of the greatest of all time) and you may be pleasantly surprised. Go in expecting the Ripley & Dallas era Alien experience and you'll be left wanting.There's not much of a story here, it's as basic as it gets. But it neatly borrows and gives subtle nods to the 1979 original here and there. A massive ship transporting thousands of people to colonize a distant planet gets caught in a solar storm and inadvertently picks up a beacon emanating from nearby (sound familiar?). The flight crew are woken by the ship and discover this newly found planet is more habitable than the one they're heading for (and changing their plans will trim seven years off their voyage into the bargain) and so decide to check it out for themselves with a view of staying there.After a slow build up this is where the action kicks in. What they hadn't bargained for is the fact that this new planet is home to the Engineers of the first Alien sequel Prometheus, and Elizabeth Shaw is the source of the beacon. As you can imagine danger, carnage & mayhem ensues. Oh, and a few xenomorphs.As always, aesthetically the film is in safe hands with Ridley at the helm. It looks gorgeous. The space scenes are magnificent. There's one scene midway through where a flashback reveals the fate of the Engineers at David's hands, and it's an awesome scene. The different types of xenomorphs look fantastic, and there are some suitably graphic and gory chest bursting scenes and visceral action that provide a good counter-balance to the more erudite and cerebral parts of the story.Michael Fassbender steals the show here. He reprises his role of David and also plays the Covenant ship's robot, this one called Walter. They both have completely different accents and personalities and Fassbender is utterly convincing as each one. The rest of the cast are capable and as characters are a massive improvement on Prometheus, they hark back to the original 1979 Alien and all seem like regular folk, without absurd eccentricities (yes I'm looking at you, Fifield and Millburn), and this is a good thing as this is without doubt Fassbender's film.If along with me you're one of the few who enjoyed Prometheus you should find a lot to like in Alien Covenant. It's by no means a masterpiece but these days what is?",9,24,45,23 May 2017
