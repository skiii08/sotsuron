Your Name.," An experience everyone has been longing for!!
","This is a film that starts off as a rom-com and later develops into one of the greatest film I've ever seen in my life. Some people might think the plot is complex while some might think otherwise. However, I believe that this film shows how director Makoto Shinkai really trusts his audience in putting the pieces together themselves thus proving how mature this film is, spiritually speaking (u'll get it once u watch it).Besides, the filmmaking technique is masterful and extraordinary. If compared to his (Makoto Shinkai) other films, this is definitely the fastest in terms of pacing. Some viewers might not manage to keep up so there is definitely reasons to re watch this film too many times. LOL. The editing really keeps the audience grounded, yet so free dreaming in the fantastical experience that one does not realize that they have been longing for since a long time ago. This is surely a legendary journey that one should not possibly miss so don't forget to buy it on Blu-ray!Oh, and the animation, FREAKIN GORGEOUS!***MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD***Moving on to to the romantic aspect of this 112-minute long film, the feelings that developed between the main characters are shown quite subtly before reaching the climax. I have to praise how director Makoto Shinkai exploits the body-swapping element by making it happen to characters who are almost impossible to meet thus making the experience of knowing each other much more interesting.",10,2,4,17 May 2017
