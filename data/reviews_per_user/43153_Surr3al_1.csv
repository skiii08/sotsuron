Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Well played Mr. Tarantino
","This film compliments the first with all the questions that were left unanswered at the ending surmise of Vol. 1. Not to mention such an ill fated and disappointing movie but it seemed that Tarantino put the action first, with the plot second - the opposite of sadly disappointing Matrix. For those that do not like the added dialogue and history behind these characters, I say that you are weren't appreciating what many movies are about... namely PLOT. You were here for the eye candy, blood spraying/action scenes that you got from the first volume, or possibly just an over zealous film buff that expects every film they see by Tarantino to be nothing short of amazing with unsurmountable originality.I found this film funny, sad, shocking, thrilling, and exciting all throughout the movie whereas I didn't quite get all those emotions in the first. I think a movie that can exert so many emotions and keep you wanting more is definitely a good movie. With that said I was more than pleased, and recommend anyone who liked the first to see this one.",Null,0,1,20 April 2004
