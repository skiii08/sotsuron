Insidious: Chapter 2," Decent Sequel
","Insidious Chapter 2 is a frightening, fun, although flawed film. It picks up right after the death of Elise (Lin Shay), and about 20 years ago when Josh (Patrick Wilson) was a boy. Yes, Josh brought something back with him. It was the parasite that stalked him as a boy. It is moving on him. It is moving on Dalton (Ty Simpkin). It is moving on the whole family. In the meantime, Elise's friend, Carl (Steve Coulter) is working with Specks and Tucker to unravel what has happened. It leads them to a a very dark secret about the parasite - or the Black Widow. First, the movie provides good suspense, good scares, and surprises without the menacing music, buckets of blood and gore, and NO CGI effects. It's a good old-fashioned ghost story with mystery, intrigue, and fear. I do have a few gripes. The story's pace is slowed by uneven execution. Between stories of Reyne's suspicion, Carl's endeavor with Spec and Tucker, and Dalton's returning clairvoyance, the story loses cohesion. I was interested in Dalton's take on things (since he was mostly in a coma in the first one). However, his story line is relegated to the back seat to focus on Josh. While Josh's story is interesting, it also takes a back seat to the uncovering of the past secrets of the black bride parasite. Finally, many of the same elements are repeated - some of which defy logic and common sense. Still, it has a familiar family we love, and a great mystery. If you liked the first one, you should like this one - but probably not as much as the first one.",7,0,0,15 September 2013
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," When the Force Fell Asleep
","Star Wars, the Phantom Menace had to be THE biggest let-down of the 1990's, if not the whole decade. For years, many Star Wars fans, like myself, awaited with baited breath for the return of the Force so we could learn what led to the demise of Anakin Skywalker and how he became Darth Vader. It starts with the Trade Federation placing an embargo on the planet, Naboo. Sent to negotiate are two Jedi Knights, Qui Gon Jin (Liam Neeson), and and young Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan MacGregor). The Trade Federation tries to kill them and they flee to the planet Naboo. There, they meet Jar Jar Binks who leads them to Princess Amidalla (Natalie Portman). They flee in her spaceship which is damaged and forced to land on a desert world, Tatooine. There, they meet a young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) who is a slave and a great pod racer. After making a few bets, Qui Gon Jinn befriends the would- be Sith Lord and gets back to the capital world, Coruscant. He takes the boy because he has strong proclivities to the Force. There, the boys meets a CGI Yoda along with Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson), and a rising political figure, Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmind). He convinces Amidalla to propose a vote of no-confidence in the Chancellor so he can use political clout to help them. Once that is done, Amidalla, Qui Gon, Obi Wan, Anakin and an annoying Jar-Jar return to Naboo for a full conflict. This movie goes from bad to worse, to more worse, to even more worse, and even more worse. The movie suffers from poor characters, weak story, poor conflict, and uneven direction. First are the characters. There is no-one for movie audiences to identify with. The Jedi are larger than life and epic, having little to no faults. There is no doubt, no longing for adventure, no fear, and no personality. Jar Jar Binks is the only one with personality, but it is annoying, ripping off all the cheesy lines from Full House while sounding like Roger Rabbit. Jake Lloyd as a young Anakin has no doubt, no fear, and actually flies a fighter in a battle. The poor dialog adds to this malaise. The story, too, is weak. At age 10, I found it easy to track the story of A New Hope, but will kids track this one? I doubt it. A bigger drawback is that special effects take precedence over the story. Lucas, now with the help of computers, places so much into the scene it takes the focus off the characters and what they are doing (or talking). And within this story there is no conflict because not only can you not identify with any of the characters, but also you don't find any hatred for the bad guys. In fact, the Battle Droids are just as cheesy and comical as Jar Jar. Finally, there is uneven direction. Lucas is not a master director. As a story board artists, and as executive producer, he shines through. This is prevalent at the climatic battle when three stories are going on and it is hard to follow. The only thing I liked was the Jedi battle with the Sith, Darth Maul, who wields a double-edged light saber. That was cool, and fun to watch. The only problems, it last about five minutes in a movie that is 130 minutes. I made a point to see the movie again, thinking I had become too cynical. No. After that, I was convinced this was the misfire of a man who used to be able to tell a simple story.",2,2,15,8 January 2016
Skyfall," Bond's Full Circle
","It took 50 years, but Daniel Craig brought Bond back to Earth and full circle to the original ideas of both the first movies and the books in his latest venture, Skyfall. Silva is a former agent of MI6 and has declared war on the organization and M, played by Judy Dench. Once a 00 himself, he wants a vendetta for her abandoning him. Bond, too, feels somewhat betray as he was hung out to dry by M when trying to recapture a hard drive containing the name of MI6 agents undercover in terrorist cells. The two are tied together. Bond disappears for a short time, only to return when he learns of the first terrorist attack on MI6 and the threat of the security breach. He's not ready, he doesn't trust M, and he's stuffing anger. Eventually, he is reactivated as M and her branch come under heavy scrutiny. She makes her plea because of how the world has lost clear, definite enemies and how they have scurried away into the shade. Silva attempts an assassination of her. Bond then takes it upon himself to protect M in his childhood home, Skyfall. Ever since Bond was re-invented in 2006 with Casino Royale, many people have lamented that Bond changed from their childhood memories of cheesy plots, megalomaniacs, cool gadgets, hot women, and a comic book persona evident ever since You Only Live Twice. Others simply think Bond is a rip-off of the modern Bourne series. Frankly, Bourne goes back to Bond. In the books, and in the first three to four movies, Bond was a ruthless assassin. He was a blunt instrument bent on stopping lethal terrorist forces and the KGB. This is probably the best part of Skyfall: it comes full circle back to the beginning. We meet Q, a young computer expert and arms expert. He's not inventing exploding pens, watches with buzz saws or super magnets, but radios and improving firearms. That is also what Q did in the books. We also meet a Moneypenny - in a round-a-bout way. There are also tips of the hats to other elements of Bond: the classic theme, the Bond entrance into the moving eye, and the best was a cameo appearance of the old Astin Martin in Goldfinger. There is also some depth. For a change there is exploration on the psyche of being a spy - also a theme in the books. And there was also an exploration of where Bond came from - but not too much so we are still left guessing. Finally, the villain, Silva, is not a megalomaniac, but a genius, vindictive egomaniac. His mind is warped by his disfigurement. True, as the villain he wasn't exceptional, but definitely competent. So for those who love the comic book Bond made famous by Moore and Brosnan, then buy those movies and enjoy them to your heart's content. Yes, I enjoyed many of them, but they are pale in comparison to the real James Bond of the books and early movies ... and Skyfall.",10,4,13,10 November 2012
Iron Man 3," The Best of the Iron Man
","Iron Man 3 is the best of the franchise. Despite the animosity of many fans, they overlook the gems that make this one really outshine the previous installments. Tony Stark must face himself, his fears, his doubts, and his own anxieties. Troubled with PTSD from the New York incident, he reminisces about duping a quiet, brilliant man and turning him into a desperate, psychotic killer. Stark must deal with this in his present state, which is straining his relationship with Pepper Potts. To deal with his problems, he tinkers with his suits, and hides from reality. Reality hits hard when the Mandarin strikes. A terrorist, the madman is responsible for various bombings in the world. He plays a cat-and-mouse game with the U.S. Rhodes, now the Iron Patriot, seeks the Mandarin while Tony Stark starts on his own trail that leads him to Killian - who has a unique tie to the Mandarin. This leads to a lot of adventure, excitement, and emotions. Many people have griped that this was the same plot as 'The Incredibles,' but plot devices are often borrowed from other sources. What really makes the plot work, though, is that not everything appears to be what it seems. Another plot strength is we see a more human Tony Stark whose liabilities cause more problems than his strength. He does have to work through the problems of the unintended consequences of previous actions. The one plot weakness was the use of a boy, Harley. Ty Simpkins does play him well, but it seemed unnecessary and a device used to grab kids into the picture. There are a couple of other plot holes and devices that are hackneyed, but the movie still works for a couple of other reasons. One is Robert Downey, Jr. Face it, Tony Stark was the one he was meant to play. He does it well. In this one, he shows some true acting by taking it to another level where Tony Stark has to face himself and reconcile his narcissism and grandiose ego juxtaposed by his PTSD. We also have good performances from Gwenyth Paltrow, Jon Favareau and the villain. Another strength is the direction that takes the plot evenly, and producing a good story with real characters that are not overplayed by the special effects. Iron Man 3 is definitely a good movie, and a rare oddity where the third in a trilogy is the best of the bunch.",9,13,20,26 April 2015
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Greatest action movie ever
","Raiders of the Lost Ark just may be the greatest action movie ever. Harrison Ford stars as Indiana Jones, an Archaeologist and adventurer who is asked by the U.S. to find the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis do. He enlists the help of Marian (Karen Allen) and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies). This leads him on the greatest adventure of intrigue, mystery, and action reminiscent of the Saturday Morning Serials. My only gripes were that the heavies were not that interesting. His archaeologist rival, Belloq, is uninspired and boring. The lead Nazi Generals, are also boring. Of course, the audience will automatically hate them simply because they are Nazis. Their actions are not really vicious. Probably what really sets this movie apart is the believability. Despite Ford becoming a one-man army, he shows his weakness. In one scene, Ford recovers the Ark from the Nazis by catching up with them, swerving to get them out of the truck, beating up the two in the front, and riding underneath the truck to survive. Almost immediately after, he is on a ship and is in so much pain he can barely get his shirt off. We get to see scars on his hand from the fighting. Indiana Jones is human. Raiders works because the story holds up, the humor holds up, and so do the leads. Indiana Jones it the part Ford was born to play, and Allen gives Marian great strength. Finally, the action is unrelenting, and serves the story well. This is the greatest. I will never get tired of watching it.",10,0,1,30 January 2008
It," Best King Horror Adaptation
","What is It? Well, It is the best Stephen King horror adaptation since Kubrick's over-indulgent The Shining, and It surpasses The Shining on so many levels. We come to the town of Derry, Maine, a town that has six-times the national average of missing people and murders. That has a huge skewing once every 27 years when It stalks food for hibernation. That is according to Ben Hanscom (Jeremy Ray Taylor), Derry's newest pre-teen denizen. He shares this information with some other kids like Bill (Jaeden Lierbeher), Richie (Finn Wolfhard), Eddie (Jack Dylan Grazer), Mike (Chosen Jacobs), Stanley (Wyatt Oleff), and Beverly (Sophia Willis). They are, in fact, the Losers Club because of their age (middle school) and tics. Bill stutters, Eddie is smothered with a hypochondriac mother, and Mike who only has the sin of being black in a very white-bred town. They are all having visions of Pennywise the Clown (Bill Skarsgard). He tricks them with illusions to create ghastly fear, and he operates from the sewers of the city to get his prey. In fact, one of his recent victims was Bill's little brother, Georgie. Of course, this motion picture only reflects the first half of King's classic novel. A sequel will reveal the second half in which the afore-mentioned come back together as adults to confront It again. If this one is any indication of the sequel, audiences will wait with heavy anticipation. It has a great screenplay penned by Chase Palmer, Careu Fkuanga, and Gary Dauberman that respects the source material and adapts it well to modern times. Even better is the direction offered by Andy Muschietti. I will add kudos to cinematography and editing of Choon-tuk Chung and Jason Pallantin, respectively. All these elements blend for a perfect recipe of horror and suspense. Jump scares are plenty without being triggered by the gotcha tropes of dogs, cats, and friends around the corner. The scares are for the monsters, visions, and disturbing images. The suspense is geared up with unpredictability. What will happen? How will these kids stop It? Even more troublesome is the evil perpetrated by real humans. The adult figures are often the absent, abusive, and overbearing parents, and the vicious bullies in town. What really makes this one work, though, are the believable, earnest performances of the young kids. We can identify with them as the ones being picked on for being fat, bookish and nerdy, or for stuttering. Even these children have differences between themselves. The 1990 TV mini-series has nothing on this one as it is raised to a level of reality without the camp or cheesy early 1990's special effects. Now to hope the sequel will live up to the success of the current installment and live up to expectations.",9,4,8,15 September 2017
Star Trek," Great time at the movies
","Face it, the Star Trek franchise needed this, badly. The new Star Trek movie is fabulous, and will definitely find new fans and give the Enterprise a good shot of adrenaline. I know a lot of classic Trekkers (I always preferred that name) are crying blaspheme since it did not follow the true 'canonical' history of the series and the original movies, but purists like that are not realists. Yes, Kirk's parents were murdered by an evil despot, he has a brother named Sam, and was originally on the Farragaut, not the Enterprise--at least that is the purist view. I can understand changes to the source material, but not in the show and movie's commitment to science. First, the warp drive works too well, making planets that were days or a couple weeks away now just a couple of hours. The other sin was Scotty's ability to beam something from one end of the galaxy to the next, even if one of those objects is at warp speed. Finally, one plot point of how Spock removes Kirk from the ship is ridiculously idiotic. However, the film has much more in the positive column. In this rebooted version by J.J. Abrams, Kirk's dad dies in the line of duty, allowing his pregnant wife to escape and give birth to James Tiberius Kirk. He is true to the maverick form portrayed in the original series, although he does not enunciate and hesitate in his painful over-acting. McCoy is also true to form as a cranky, old-fashioned doctor who is leery of new technology, especially transportation. My favorite (as it has always been) is the reboot of Scotty. Yes, he's still Scottish, he's still an engineering genius, but he's a lot more comical. Spock (Zachary Quinto), though, is taken in a different light. He must learn to follow his emotions and look to them. And we get all the phrases used: 'I'm given her all I got, Captain,' 'I'm a doctor, not a physicist,' 'Fascinating.' We get Captain Christopher Pike, Sarek, the Khobayashi Maru, and Romulans. The plot is that a Romulan Commander, Captain Nero (Eric Bana), travels back through time to exact revenge on the Federation. You see, the Spock we all know and love (Leonard Nimoy) was trying to prevent the Romulan sun from going supernova. However, he is too late, so Nero vows revenge and travels back in time to punish both Vulcan and Earth. This leads the Enterprise, commanded by Pike, to appoint Spock as acting captain and Kirk as the first officer. There are so many things that go so well with this movie. First, it is laced with action scenes blended with fantastic CGI effects the old television series could never duplicate. We also get the first taste of actually using the up and down mode with space as opposed to forward, reverse, and side to side. The audience is also treated to a more conflicted Spock. There is also a strong tension between Kirk and his Vulcan ally. There is a little romance, and some kick-ass space battles. There is also room for sequels (of course). Reading some earlier reviews, I recall seeing one calling this Star Trek the best prequel ever made. I agree. I can't wait for what's next.",7,2,9,8 May 2009
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A Decent Addition to the Star Wars Saga
","Star Wars Rogue One puts the 'war' in Star Wars. It is gritty, dirty, and a dark trail that eventually leads to hope. It starts without a crawl, but we quickly meet Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) and her parents on a remote ring world. An Empire Officer known as Orson Krenic craves the power and grandeur behind the building of the Death Star and forces Jyn's father, Galen Esro (Mads Mikkelson) back to the Empire to help build it. Jyn was raised by Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker) for several years. One day, he disappears, seeking to join an extreme wing of the Rebellion against the Empire, and she is now on her own. Another faction of the Rebellion liberates her from an Empire transport and she finds herself flung into the Rebellion. Her two allies, Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and a droid K2SO (Voice of Alyn Turdyk) are on a mission to find an Empire pilot who has defected. He has knowledge of the Death Star. On their way to find him, they find two more allies, Baze Mallbus (Wen Jian) and Chirrut (Donnie Yen). A series of events leads our rebels to a lonely planet where Jyn is reunited briefly with her father, to find out he has a plan of his own. Once they return to the Rebel Base on Yavin 4, rebels contemplate deserting their cause out of fear. Jyn, Assian, Baze and Chirrut cannot walk away from it, though. Finding a group of rebels determined to forge ahead, they make a run at stealing the plans of the Death Star. First out, this has good action, paced with some character development and story development. It is a dark side of the rebellion that has soldiers who have gone to extreme measures for their cause. Moreover, they have been hardened by the gritty, dark side of war. And this is the troops part of war, lacking the Force, light sabers, and duels. the closest we get to the Force is Chirrut, a blind man who would rather chant his way with the Force instead of emptying himself. Of course, the sinister Darth Vader is back, with the voice of James Earl Jones. He did have ample screen time and a pretty good battle scene against some rebel soldiers. The best part was the epic battle between the Rebellion and the Empire in the effort to steal the Death Star Plans. And for all the nitpickers who griped about the design of the Death Star will find a very satisfying answer. The characters are not fleshed out as well as the original trilogy, and the CGI used for the return of Grand Moff Tarkin was used way too much and will likely kick an audience out of the story for a while. Still, overall, this has it all for Star Wars fans: fights, space combat, droids, and decent stories, decent characters, and the perfect cameos.",7,2,4,11 February 2017
Dawn of the Dead," Pretty good remake.
","Usually, I do not like remakes. However, the contemporary version of Dawn of the Dead breaks the usual trend and entertained me. It could never live up to the original caliber and vision of the original 1978 masterpiece, but it makes a good movie in its own rite. A nurse named Ana (Sarah Polley) wakes up one morning to find her world upside down. Her husband is immediately infected by a virus that brings back the dead. She runs to find Kenneth (Ving Rhames), Steve (Ty Burrell) along with a few other survivors. Afraid of the zombies, they decide to hide in a large mall. Unfortunately, they meet the wrong mall security guards. CJ (Michael Kelly) leads his deputies to threaten, intimidate, and harass their fellow humans whom they consider captives. Eventually, Ana, Steve and Kenneth are able to take over and allow more people to seek refuge in the mall. They make a friend across the street. Andy (Bruce Bohne) might as well be miles away as thousands of zombies litter the street in full force. They communicate with signs. Eventually, they realize they cannot stay or they will die. They make an attempt to escape to an island within the Great Lakes. To review this one, you have to compare it to the original. In the first place, I will fault the new adaptation with having too many characters. At one point, it gets weighed down. Still, the dynamic is more ripe for conflict amidst the survivors. At the same time, some characters are redeemed, like CJ who eventually comes around to be an all right guy. Also, the idea of fast moving zombies really adds to the tension. It made me wonder if they represented the disenfranchised and angry consumer as opposed to the mindless shopper zombie of the original movie. Also, while the original had a few scares, this one is more action oriented. It moves much faster to entertain instead of developing slowly to create thought. I also liked the cameos by Scott Reiniger, David Emgee and Ken Foree. I will also say this version has a more cynical and dark ending as opposed to the original. This is neither good or bad, just different. Still, I thought the movie deserved a better ending. Dawn of the Dead 2004 has enough to make it fresh, and enough to keep you interested. Just don't expect it to overshadow Romero's masterpiece.",8,0,0,7 February 2008
Star Trek Into Darkness," Great Star Trek Movie
","While the previous Star Trek gave the franchise a desperately needed shot of adrenaline, Star Trek Into Darkness resurrects the franchise into full force. Kirk and Spock are on a planet where they must save the alien race from certain doom. Both violate the prime directive so many times, it is enough for Pike to yank both of them off the Enterprise, or at least out of the captain's chair. Then, things turn dark. A mysterious federation officer has staged a terrorist act against the Federation. Kirk's job now is to track down this man and kill him under the order of Admiral Marcus. Kirk, though, captures the fugitive and discovers his secret: he is Kahn, a ruthless 21st century genetically altered human. He wants Marcus killed for a sinister betrayal. Ironically, Kirk cannot trust either Marcus or Kahn. This movie has a few strikes against it. The idea of reusing Kahn for a nemesis was a good idea, but terribly marketed. Abrams denied it was Kahn for a long time. However, that is marketing. The cinematic problem was a movie a bit too long, and one that desperately wanted to play homage to the original Star Trek Kahn movie. I laughed at Spock's 'Kaaaaaaaahhhhhhhn.' It was forced and downright stupid. Finally, because of this plot piece, it drags the movie out a little too long. Another gripe is that, just like the previous installment, Dr. McCoy is not used well. My biggest issue was that JJ. Abrams makes the galaxy much smaller with the warp drive - which makes planets that should be days or possibly weeks away a mere three or four hour jaunt. Adding to that silliness was the new transporter technology makes it capable to beam hundreds or thousands of light-years across the galaxy. On the other hand, it has a lot going for it. The Kirk/Spock relationship is the core of the movie. The characters also have to learn and grow. Scotty becomes alienated because of the secrecy and sinister nature of the assignment. The space battles are epic, and we get something we have always wanted to see: a star ship falling through the atmosphere. This is a good movie providing some good, epic, battles and stories for a new generation of Star Trek fans to enjoy.",9,3,5,5 January 2014
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Not for the faint of heart
","My first exposure to South Park was the film, Bigger, Longer and Uncut. Experiencing it for the first time, I was shocked, bewildered, and entertained by Stan's search for confidence, Kyle's moral compass, Eric's obnoxious personality, and Kenny's death. The Terrance and Philip movie has swept through South Park. It is so profanity laden, the kids of South Park are imitating the art. This provokes a violent reaction by the parents, it eventually leads to the capture of Terrance and Philip. Since they are Canadian, our neighbor to the north decides to declare war on the U.S. Meanwhile, Satan plans to use the war, particularly the execution of Terrance and Philip to usher in his new reign on the Earth. I will first get a few gripes out of the way. While The Simpsons uses subtle irony and satire to provoke thought, South Park hits the audience over the head with a shovel. There is no subtlety. In fact, sometimes the spirit is downright mean and vicious. In fact, sometimes it slaps fundamentalist puritanical culture with the same hatred it dishes out. This is the predominant weakness of South Park. Parker and Stone work so hard to shock and offend, they often sacrifice that for the message they try to get across. Also, the lovers spat between Saddam Hussein and the Devil was really drawn out too long, making the movie about 20 minutes too long. But there are some things that work. The best part is the humor that rests in both irony and unpredictable dialog and situations. One of my favorite parts was having Cartman rigged up to a V-chip that gives him a shock every time he utters a curse word. Another good scene involves the rescue of Terrance and Philip amidst a very strange USO show featuring Big Gay Al. Another involves the U.S. military strategists shooting Bill Gates for making Windows 98 too hard to handle. What really got me to like this movie, though, was its overbearing satire. Despite the shock factor, most people will get what Parker and Stone are trying to say. At one point, Kyle tries to dissuade his Mom from her vendetta against Terrance and Philip. However, she is so wrapped up in stopping their filth, she forgets to pay attention to her son. Also, one musical number stands out: Blame Canada. Apparently, the parents of South Park were so outraged at Terrance and Phlip, they break into song. Their battle cry is to 'blame Canada before someone thinks of blaming us!' South Park does push the limit of good taste ... but that is what makes it fun. You could enjoy it ... if you are not too easily offended.",7,0,0,9 January 2008
Spider-Man 2," Spider-Man rocks!
","Spider-Man 2 is one of the best super hero movies ever. Peter Parker is still dealing with the dichotomy with being a super-hero. He loves and hates it at the same time. On the one hand, he realizes 'with great power comes great responsibility,' but he still wants his own life. It seems that every promise made to others he cares about is broken because of his self-imposed 'responsibility.' He cannot hold a job because he felt compelled to stop a robbery. He misses Mary Jane's play for a similar occasion. Adding insult to injury, is the fact that his powers are misfiring. He keeps losing his mastery of equilibrium, he cannot stick to walls, and he cannot sling his web. Frustrated, he packs up being Spider-Man. But is it for the best? At the same time, Doctor Octavius is trying to show Peter Parker the mastery of fusion power. It could solve the world's energy problem, mostly by copying the power of the sun. His robotic arms used to control the experiment fuse with his spinal cord and brain functions, giving the scientist a split personality. Now, he is controlled by the artificial intelligence of his robotic arms. Doc Ock needs a special element to continued his experiments. Only a vindictive Harry Osborne has. Since he wants Spider-Man dead, Doc Ock has to kill Spidey to get his precious metal. At the outset, this movie does so well in giving us super-heroes who we care about. The characters and story do not take precedence over the special effects. Director Sam Raimi does well in making Mary Jane, Harry Osborne, Peter Parker, and even Aunt May believable as real people. This is probably the best strength. We identify with them because they have the same problems we do. Aunt May cannot meet mortgage requirements, Peter can't pay rent, Harry turns to alcohol after an abysmal failure, and Mary Jane is frustrated with Peter's lack of commitment. Probably the best scene that shows this believability is when Peter confides in Aunt May. In fact, I think Rosemary Harris does a fantastic job, giving this background character real strength. I also liked the way Doc Ock was given some depth and intrigue. As a villain, he is smart, powerful, and strong. Even more intriguing is how he meets his demise, which will surprise the audience. However, the action and special effects are the topping on the cake. The fight scenes between Spidey and Doc Ock are incredibly fantastic, giving such intricate detail that will even wow a CGI specialist. One of those involves Spidey trying to save Aunt May from Doc Ock atop a high building. A better scene involves the two opponents fighting atop a moving elevated train. In any case, Spider-Man 2 is the best of the series, and probably the best super-hero movie ever ... so far.",9,5,6,19 February 2008
Spider-Man 3," The Web is Very Tangled
","Spiderman 3's webbing caught me. Fortunately, I got out of it. This third installment by Sam Raimi and Tobey MacGuire shows a lot of misfiring of the web as well as the execution of a disjointed screenplay. Spiderman/Peter Parker is riding high on his success. He is planning on proposing to Mary Jane Watson. However, following a disappointing opening night and being replaced, she is down in the dumps and Peter has no clue how to help her. At the same time, an alien symbiote has fallen to earth in a small meteorite. Also, Flint Marko escapes from prison. A person who was complicit with the death of Ben Parker, he falls into the midst of a scientific experiment that turns him into the Sandman. Harry Osborne, the Green Goblin II, is still planning his revenge against Peter Parker/Spiderman. They fight, and Harry gets amnesia, forgetting his feud with Peter/Spidey. He starts dating Mary Jane. Also, a new photographer, Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), gets on at the Daily Bugle and starts annoying Peter Parker. Furthermore, Gwen Stacy is a new friend of Peter, and Brock likes her. Eventually, the symbiote gets on Peter, taps his dark side, but then ditches the new suit that merges with Brock and becomes Venom. If you can't follow that story, then you get the problem. The movie tries to do way too much with a huge, disjointed story, and too many characters. Ironically, all the performers give great, credible performances with the loose screenplay. Raimi even does a good job at directing the actors and characters, but has trouble with the labyrinth screenplay. He does well with the juxtaposition of Venom and Sandman as one is redeemed, but the other isn't. He handles ideas of forgiveness as well. Where Raimi and MacGuire fail is when Peter Parker gives into the dark side with the symbiote suit. It becomes ridiculously silly. Then, as the Symbiote attaches itself to Eddie Brock to become Venom, it is clear that Topher Grace was terribly miscast as an evildoer. The worst part is the campy ending that somewhat rivals the Batman and Robin fiasco. No, this is not a complete disaster, but it cannot be rated as a masterpiece, either.",5,0,2,5 July 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spider-Man Swings Back to the Top
","Spider-Man Homecoming is appropriately named, finally bringing our favorite web-slinger home to fun, lighthearted fun. After the Raimi- Maguire era came to an ignoble stop, and after Garfield's gloomy, glum, grim take bottomed it out, Spidey is swinging strong. This is the best since the apex of Raimi's Spider-Man 2 over a decade ago. We begin immediately after the Avengers defeat of the Chitari in New York when Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) is scavenging through the alien technology. He was contracted to do so, but then ingloriously kicked to the curb by the government and Tony Stark/Ironman (Robert Downey, Jr.) He takes some for himself to research and use. Kick forward to near present day when Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tom Holland) helps the Stark Team against the Cap Team in Civil War. Then, we return to New York where Stark tells Spider-Man he will be an asset to the Avenger and to wait for his call. Spidey is now relegated to the kids table while Happy Hogan (Jon Faverau) 'monitors' his progress. The adults tend to ignore Peter Parker as he gives minor help and juggles his life at high school. He still wants to prove himself, and eventually stumbles across Toomes' team as they try to sell weapons fueled by alien technology, and rob from ATMs. Happy and Tony tell Spidey to stay out of the big stuff, but not much else. Spidey is desperate to prove he is ready and pursues the low-lying crime syndicate on his own. He does a few impressive things, but eventually, his endeavors backfire. Tony Stark/Ironman has to bail him out, and takes the suit. Alone, Spidey has to figure out how to save the day. There are a few gripes to get out of the way. First is the Spider-Man suit from Stark can do as much as the Ironman suit. This takes away from Peter's ingenuity and creativity he displays in the comics. Secondly, the Aunt May character is underused, undeveloped, and miscast. And this seems to be a conscious decision by writers and producers to focus on the Peter Parker cadre at school. Aunt May is a prominent character, and can show all of strength as Rosemary Harris proved in Spider-Man 2. Finally, the lacking of adults in the movie spreads to the crew as well. With the focus on high school, mostly Peter's peers, it is a high school movie. Of course, Peter is in high school, and attempting to reconcile his aspirations for peers and his responsibility. On the other hand, the strengths of homecoming outpace this missteps. The first kudos is to Tom Holland who portrays the web-slinger with such conflict, hope, and frustration so well. Between his anger with Happy and Tony, and reconciling his disappearances with Aunt May and his friends, and trying to impress the Avengers, Holland gives us an earnest performance. The audience will believe he is 16. Just as good is Michael Keaton as Adrian Toomes. As a Spider-Man comic collector, I never held the Vulture is high regard. That goes the opposite way in this cinematic adaptation. This was the best villain since Doc Ock in Spider-Man 2. He does garner sympathy to a certain extent, but Keaton gives the Toomes character the right amount of bitterness, anger, and desperation. Finally, there is a Spider-Man who has to reckon with being a kid and wanting to be an adult with adult figures failing him. As a kid, he makes mistakes because he does not stop to think things through. This is Spider-Man movie of the future. It works, and works well. It still does not have the power and gravitas of the original Raimi/Maguire movies (1-2), but it is a great one for the ages.",7,2,6,7 July 2017
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Great ending of the greatest trilogy ever.
","While Return of the Jedi is my least favorite of the original three Star Wars movies, but it still packs a good punch and closes out the best trilogy of motion picture history. It begins with C3PO and R2D2 visiting Jabba the Hutt. They find Captain Solo (Harrison Ford) still in carbonite. Chewabacca (Peter Mayhew) is captured, along with Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) who was incognito as a renegade bounty hunter. It is up to Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to save the day. As a real Jedi, he is able to confound Jabba's men, destroy his barge, and rescue Leia, Han, Lando, and Chewie. The remaining two-thirds of the film deal with the final rebel assault against a new Death Star. Emperor Palpatine himself oversees the project with Darth Vader. As Luke and Han launch an attack to take out the defense shield from the moon of Endor, they meet some strange friends, the Ewoks. This leads to rollicking fun, great space battles, action sequences, awesome special effects, and Luke's temptation to join the dark side. I did have a few gripes with this movie. I know Lucas originally wanted to have the Ewok battle originally done with Wookies. I wished he would have stuck to that because the idea of stone-throwing teddy bears warring against storm troopers strained credibility. The only other strike was not introducing us to Emperor Palpatine sooner. He is only mentioned in the first Star Wars movie, and we do get a holographic image of him in the Empire Strikes Back ... but as the true master of evil he should have been brought in earlier. Nevertheless, Luke, Han, Leia and Chewie overthrow the Empire once and for all, restoring balance to the force and allowing good to triumph over evil. If only more movies could do that better.",8,0,1,20 January 2008
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Movie Good, Trilogy Bad
","The latest Star Wars movie, Rise of Skywalker, delivers a good movie. Unfortunately, it is not enough to completely rebound from The Last Jedi. True, I enjoyed the previous outing more than most people, but Rise of Skywalker was better in many ways.
We pick up right after the end of the last one - where we found out Kylo Wren is hearing the voice of Palpatine. He flies to the Sith Planet and discovers the former Emperor is alive and trying to manifest himself within another. Then, we return to Rey being trained by Leia. Poe, Fin and Chewie are up to saving the galaxy as one. When they all put their heads together, they realize the only way to find the Sith Planet is through a Sith Finder that will guide them there. To find the clues, Fin, Poe, Rey, Chewie and Threepio must travel to a couple of different planets, ending their quest near the Endor system where fragments of the Death Star have landed. Rey and Kylo are playing a cat and mouse game and have their final light saber duel. Now it is up to Rey to stop Palpatine and the Resistance fleet to stop Palpatine for returning and taking his new fleet to conquer the galaxy. The journey is fun, the battles are epic, and the story is ... well a story.
This is my first gripe of the new movie. While the pacing is far better, some things are developed that do not pay off well. Threepio seems to be making a huge sacrifice, which is really not has heave as we were led to believe. Adding to that sin is the attempt to do too much, too quickly. No, it is never boring, nor does it drag, but the plot is haphazard and unfocused. Also, Abrams has the direct intention of putting a Lesbian kiss, hoping to make a cinematic universe full of Wookies, Jawas, Uhgnaughts, Ewoks, and whatever the hell Jar-Jar Binks seem more culturally diverse.
The biggest error, though, was lack of a cohesive story. I'm not talking about the individual movies, but rather within the scheme or a trilogy. For the most part, there is no consistency to bring them together. Even though the prequels were terrible, they did have consistency, and story-arcs that played out. The original trilogy did it superbly. The blame here, though, rests solely on Disney. After the Force Awakens with Abrams, it was handed off with no idea of the beginning, middle and end.Johnson took what Abrams did and discarded much of it - mostly on the death of Snoke. Now it was up to Abrams to set things straight, which forces him to make a long movie that has to rectify things like Rey's parents, and the death of Snoke.
However, what makes up for it is the individual movie. I liked the three new protagonists of Rey, Fin and Poe together most of the movie - something missing in the last two movies. Also, Adam Driver does a great job as Kylo Wren. He is a superb actor with a good, sinister presence. Daisey Ridley also makes a convincing Rey as someone who struggles with her identity and who her parents were. And, of course, are key cameos, some fan service, epic battles, and incredible special effects.
You will not be blown away by Rise of Skywalker, but I think fans will like this one more than Last Jedi. Still, the next time Disney decides to make a trilogy, I hope they realize a trilogy must be a three-part story, not three separate films.",8,2,6,22 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack of the Clowns
","My brother once asked me, 'What is Attack of the Clones' about. My answer: 'It's about two hours and 20 minutes too long.' While I hoped that George Lucas might push the reset button and go back to telling a story about characters we cared about, my hopes were dashed when Star Wars Attack of the Clones. There have been several attempts on Amidalla's (Natalie Portman) life. The attacks continue when she returns to Corsuscant to meet two old friends: Ben Kenobi (Ewan MacGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christianssen). They go after one attempted assassin who turns out to be Jango Fett, the father of Boba. Curious, Ben Kenobi does an investigation that leads him to a distant world in which an alien race has created an army of clones under the direction and dealing of a former Jedi, Dooku. This way, the Empire can now have a standing army. The template is based on Jango Fett (so I guess he was a lousy shot with a blaster?). Meanwhile, Anakin and Padme go to her home world of Naboo and start to fall in love. Anakin starts to resent the Jedi order as he feels Kenobi is not treating him well. He returns to Tatooine to visit his mother. She has been kidnapped by the Tusken Raiders and Anakin finds her just as she dies. He goes berserk. Returning to Padme, he confides in her and their loves grows. They decide to find Ben Kenobi on the planet of Geonosis, home world of the Trade Federation. Through a series of events, all three survive a battle droid factory, are put in an arena with large, mean alien animals, and join a large Jedi battle against the Trade Federation. Joining them are the new clone troops. This eventually leads to Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) where Anakin, Kenobi, and Yoda all do their best with their Light Sabers, but come up short. My first gripe was the pacing of the plot: slow. Moreover, the exposition usually resides in people sitting and talking to let the audience know its plot points. My second gripe was the acting coupled with the worst dialog since Captain Kirk's monologues in the TV version of Star Trek. In fact, Christianssen's lame acting rivals that of Shatner, although the latter was usually tongue-in-cheek about it. There is absolutely no chemistry between Anakin and Padme. Again, we have epic characters who don't care, because the actors do not care. It boils down again to Lucas who cares more about sets and special effects instead of telling a story. As a matter of fact, I found this one the most boring of the entire franchise. I struggled in staying awake at a point in this movie. Even worse, I felt like leaving at one point, but stayed thinking 'This might get better.' I was wrong. At least the light saber battle in Phantom Menace provided a little bit of entertainment because it was truly different and innovative. This was Lucas at his worst.",2,0,5,22 January 2016
Justice League," Not as bad as most suggest
","Justice League, like so many of the comic book superhero movies, is very average, but hardly has bad as many critics and fans suggest. DC Comics/Warner Brothers has been playing catch-up to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, although it has not been as nearly consistent in quality.
Bruce Wayne/Batman has been invigorated with hope since he witnessed Clark Kent/Superman sacrifice himself to stop Doomsday in Batman v. Superman. He is working with Diana Prince/Wonder Woman to build a team of heros to deal with the growing problem of powerful enemies. He recruits the elusive Arthur Curry/Aquaman, Barry Allen/Flash, and Cyborg. While the Flash (Ezra Miller) is on board quickly (no pun intended), Curry and Cyborg are a little reticent.
While this team is being assembled by Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), the menacing Steppenwolf returns to the Earth to recover the four Mother Boxes left on the Earth. The Amazons have one, the Atlanteans have the other, while two others remain missing. As he moves in on them, the newly formed Justice League takes action. However, they lack a certain something to defeat the powerful being.
The only choice, they assume, is to resurrect Superman. It is obvious he comes back, but he is not right. Superman must remember who he is and what he represents. Kal-El/Clark/Superman retreats back to Smallville to rediscover who he is while the remaining Justice League take a gamble on defeating Steppenwolf.
First, the bad. The movie was a bit rushed, not giving enough exposition to set up the plot. The audience really has to pay attention to a quick-paced story. Another Achilles heal to the franchise is stealing ideas. In the early days of Marvel, they borrowed ideas from DC. As their cinematic universes expand, the opposite is happening. The World Boxes are the DC answer to the Infinity Stones of the MCU, and Steppenwolf is Loki, although a bit more sinister.
On the other hand, we have some good conflict, and decent characters. While Cyborg lacks imagination, Erza Miller gives Flash his usual smart-ass comments and humor laced with a little fear. Even better is Jason Momoa's interpretation of Arthur Curry/Aquaman that defies the culture of ridicule and jokes of his uselessness by being stronger and tougher. Henry Cavill, however, really shows a little more depth as he renews relationships with his mother (Diane Lane) and Lois (Amy Adams).
Do stick around for a couple of post-credit scenes, because one of them sets up for whatever the sequel will be. Sure, their writers could take some lessons from the MCU writers, but this DC outing is pretty decent.",7,1,1,8 September 2018
Man of Steel," Man of Steel?
","Man of Steel does for Superman what Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy did for Batman: made two superheroes as real people in the real world. While the movie does misfire at times, it is a good, solid piece of the DC universe. Of course, we must go through the origin story since this is an official reboot. So we have to learn of Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and General Zod (Michael Shannon), the plot to overthrow the planet, the exile of Zod and his cohorts, and the escape of Kal-El to Earth. The story continues as the Kents adopt the boy and watch him grow up. Straying from the story, Clark (Henry Cavill) is a loner, realizing his abilities and identity make him an outsider. He does good deeds, moves on, does some more incredible good deeds, and moves on. He eventually discovers his father's spaceship. Also discovering the ship is a young Lois Lane (Amy Adams) who has been following the trail of mysterious good deeds. It is then, she discovers the lonely Superman. As he reveals himself to the world, it does not know what to do with him â€“ especially the U.S. military. All that changes when Zod escapes and returns to Earth. Now, they must trust the incredible alien. A few problems do exist in the story. The beginning is laden with a complex plot addition that seems irrelevant to the rest of the story. It does allow for Zod to have a slight motivation, but it is negligible to the story's end, and it drags it down a little long. Second, the end battle is drawn out a bit too long, overdosing on the destruction and mayhem of a real fight between the last two survivors of Kyrpton. However, this is the greatest aspect in this particular version of Superman: a gritty realism in both characters and situations. It really gets going as Clark goes through changes, discovering his super- hearing and super-sight at a young age and not knowing how to deal with them. This keeps him as an outsider and a loner. Another scene has him deal with a rowdy restaurant patron who pours beer over Clark's head. When he discovers flight, Superman must learn to control it, and eventually finds it exhilarating. One of the best scenes is when he circles half the globe and then ascends to the edge of space. Then comes the burden of being Superman: defending the people of Earth from Zod. This is a lonely life that keeps him isolated. And his super powers cannot shield him from emotional trauma and his own fear of rejection. The characters of Jonathan (Kevin Costner) and Martha (Diane Lane) are stellar, giving a sense of worry and love for their adopted son. Many people are going to want to compare this one to the original Superman starring Christopher Reeve. True, it is a classic, especially with the more difficult special effects needed at that time. Also, Reeve played the roles of Clark and Superman as opposites: Clark the bumbling, inept fool, and Superman as the confident, strong type. Henry Cavill, gives a more quiet performance, giving us emotion on both sides of his identity. He does struggle with who he is, while Reeve only struggles as Clark. Margo Kidder gave us a strong Lois, but she was still ditzy. Amy Adams is strong and passionate, but needs coaching on restraint from Perry White. Also, Laurence Fishburne is a strong, wise, and reserved Perry White. Simply put: the older version was for kids, Man of Steel is for the adults that want to see realism in our heroes â€“ even the imagined ones like Superman. We all have to reconcile seeing our parents, and our heroes as real, fallible human beings. In this case, Man of Steel, is about a Superman who may have steel-like skin, but has a fragile soul like the rest of us.",7,0,0,20 July 2017
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," James Cameron's Best
","Pardon the pun, but Arnold Schwarzneggar is back in his greatest role: The Terminator. But wait  this time he is the hero.Terminator 2 Judgment Day is one those rare sequels that outshines the original. In the 1984 blockbuster hit, the Terminator goes back in time to 1984 to try and kill the mother of the resistance movement against the machines. It fails as Kyle Reese saves Sarah Connor from certain doom, and fathers the man, Jon Connor.In Terminator 2, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) has gone nuts knowing about the future. She tried to blow up a computer lab to stop Judgment Daythe day when the Computer Skynet takes over all U.S. Defense systems and launches a nuclear attack against the former Soviet Union to start a Nuclear War.Jon Connor (Edward Furlong) is in foster care, but has been getting into trouble over truancy, shoplifting, and other juvenile offenses. Then, a new Terminator, a T-1000 comes from the future to assassinate Jon. It is made of liquid metal, can assume the form of almost anyone it touches, and can create stabbing weapons. Enter the good Terminator (Schwarzeneggar). It goes back to time to protect Jon, rescue Sarah from the mental hospital, and hopefully stop Judgment Day.Terminator 2 has so much going for it, it is difficult to know where to begin. First is the acting and the characters. This was the part Arnold was born to play. Linda Hamilton plays Sarah with such depth, anger, fear, and desperation, it is stunning. Newcomer Edward Furlong also does an outstanding job as someone who knows too much about the future as well.A smaller supporting cast member, Joe Morton, plays Miles Dyson who invents Skynet, and he must deal with knowledge of the future. And Robert Patrick, who plays the T-1000 is one of the greatest villains in movie history. His eyes and moves makes up for his lack of lines. And he is the first villain since the alien of Predator that Arnold could not 'beat-up.'The second strength is the story. There is depth and intrigue. Ironically, Sarah Connor forgets to value human life, whereas the good Terminator learns to respect it. The good Terminator also has keen insight into human nature. At one point, he states 'now I know why you cry.'A quick kudos has to go towards the special effects of Terminator 2. Aside from the fact they do not distract from the story, they are the best new stuff since the first Star Wars. Most notably was how the T-1000 changed or morphed from one disguise to another.The final strength is the stellar direction done by James Cameron. While the first Terminator bordered on B movie plot, characters and effects, this one ranks high on cerebral science-fiction like that of Blade Runner. Cameron deftly mixes stunts, action, special effects, story, and depth into one tasty recipe.",10,1,2,4 July 2008
Spider-Man," Pretty good start for the franchise
","I had been looking forwards to the Spider-Man movie since the mid 1980's. I started collecting Amazing Spider-Man at the age of nine and had all from #150 to 400 along with all other accompanying titles. I was so anxious to see how film maker Sam Raimi would do it. He did not disappoint, although he took the mythology a different direction. Instead of a radio active spider born out of the fear of nuclear holocaust, we have a genetically altered born of the fear of genetic tampering. Also, instead of Peter Parker creating his web from science, his body creates. We follow the same predictable plot line of Peter wanting to use his powers to wrestle in order to get money. When a robber takes the money winnings, Peter has a chance to stop him but doesn't. Later, when he tracks Uncle Ben's killer, he finds the same robber. Now we have to hear 'with great power comes great responsibility.' Peter is now driven by guilt to be responsible and stop the bad guys. Unfortunately, one of those bad guys is very powerful. The Green Goblin comes in with his glider and explosives to wreck havoc on New York. It is up to Spidey to stop him. First, Tobey McGuire was perfectly cast as the nerdy, smart, and introverted Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He gives the character depth, charm, and wit. Peter finds a lot of self confidence through his super hero persona. Also well cast was James Franco as Harry Osborne. He is the good friend embarrassed by excessive wealth on his father's part. Even better was G.K. Simmons as Daily Bugle Publisher J. Jonah Jameson. He is the fast-talking opportunist who uses his rag with more abuse than Joseph Putlitzer and William Randolph Hearst combined. Willhelm Defoe plays Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. He is the entrepreneur and scientist who is driven to the edge by his own obsession. My only gripe is that his mask prevents us from seeing the emoting from his eyes and face. Kirsten Dunst makes Mary Jane believable, strong, and forceful. She made the role her own and made it work well. Also, a congratulations must be given to Rosemary Harris who gives the Aunt May a personality that was never strong in the comics. Director Sam Raimi gives us a real story about real people, which is what made the comic a gem. The audience can identify with the different characters. They have precedence over the special effects, which are outstanding in their own rite. While the original X-Men got the super hero to movie craze started, this one put the idea on the map.",8,0,1,21 February 2008
The Amazing Spider-Man," Decent Reboot
","When you reboot a franchise, the goal is to give the story a shot of stimulants to get it going again. Just like the recent Star Trek reboots, the Amazing Spider-Man does give the franchise a little boost, especially after the flawed and unfocused Spider-Man 3. However, it isn't the most groundbreaking, either. We have to get the origin story going again - although this time we get a little more into Peter Parker's absent parents. Once the story gets going, we are introduced to Dr. Curt Connors - AKA the Lizard. In all honesty, this was a great villain - probably the best one Spidey faced in the comics of yore. This was a flawed person that Spider-Man/Parker was always trying to help and redeem. We also have two vintage comic characters, Gwen Stacey and Captain Ned Stacey. Yes, they were introduced in Raimi's campy Spider-Man 3, but they were out of sync with the canonical story. This fresh take, does keep with the older comic stories and characters - and with Parker developing the web on his own. There was also a good casting call of making Martin Sheen who made a great Ben Parker. Sally Field, though, as Aunt May seemed a little weak as opposed to Rosemary Harris who gave the character a lot of strength. The one miscast (slightly) was Andrew Garfield as the new Parker/Spider- Man. I'm sorry, but Garfield did not give us the nerdy outcast vibe Maguire gave us. I thought the story moved a little slow. This one is also darker than the previous installments. It does not, however, resort to the camp and silliness of the previous Spidey venture. Overall, though, it was a fun time at the movies. It was not as fun as Raimi's first two ventures, but still enjoyable.",5,2,4,3 July 2013
Avengers: Endgame," The Resolution We Have Been Waiting For
","The hardest thing to do is end something. The ending of a story, novel, or movie is probably the hardest thing to write. This is not the climax and falling action, but the resolution, where all the dangling threads are tied up and resolved. Very few writers can create one with supreme satisfaction - mostly because in this day and age writers want sequels and franchises. Avengers Endgame is the pinnacle of Marvel movies. It is a masterpiece of the super-hero genre. It gives closure, and resolution.
The movie picks up almost immediately after Thanos snapped half the world out of existence. The remaining Avengers, Iron Man (Tony Stark), War Machine (Don Cheedle), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and Rocket (Bradley Cooper) are trying to gather their wits after they had their asses handed to them.
Tony is on his way back to Earth from Titan. His only companion is Nebula (Karen Gillian). Fortunately, Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) comes to the rescue. Bringing them back to Earth, they are reunited ... for a moment. Tony wants nothing to do with them after Cap's betrayal. He goes back to Pepper.
The remaining heroes track down Thanos (Josh Brolin) and find the Infinity Stones have destroyed themselves, as well as him. Now, what do we do?
Five years later, a van in San Francisco has its computer activated by a mouse. It activates the shrinking device that left Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) stranded in the shrunken universe. He comes back - but the five year isolation was only five hours to the Ant Man. He traverses the nation to find the Avengers. When he learns of what happened, he has an idea. The microscopic universe has entry and exit points in time.
Yes, they can travel back in time and find the Infinity Stones, bring them back, and snap everyone back into existence. Hey, you have to realize that time travel was going to come into this sooner or later. The Avengers need Tony to figure out a way to take out the random effects, but he is tied too much to Pepper (Gwenyth Paltrow), and their daughter, Morgan.
Tony, though, cannot back out of a possibility of setting things right. He is onboard with the idea, so three teams travel back to different points. Tony, Bruce, Steve, and Scott (hey, my name's Steve Scott!) head to New York after the Avengers battle. Roadie, Nebula, Nadia, and Clint (Jeremy Renner) return to the stellar world where two other stones exist. Rocket and Thor return to Asgaarrd before its destruction to fetch a couple of others.
As they find the stones, they find themselves - as well as a slew of MCU characters that helped and hindered them on the way. Loki, Brumlow, Sitwell, Pierce (Robert Redford) all have their cameos as former HYDRA secret operatives. Of course, it would be a sin not to have Tom Hiddleston return as Loki. Tony and Steve go to another spot where Steve catches a glimpse of Peggy Carter (Haylee Atwell), and Tony gets to have some words with his father, Howard Stark (John Slattery).
Thor gets to see Jane again (Natalie Portman), as well as his mother, Frigga (Rene Russo). Rocket has to work hard and convince him to take the stones back. Of course, Thor cannot leave without one particular thing.
Meanwhile, Clint and Nadia have to retrieve the Soul Stone. They need a soul to get it. At the same time, Thanos, who is alive at this point, realizes the Nebula of the past is having glitches. He and Gamora (Zoe Saldana) are able to figure out what they are doing there. Realizing their plan, he has to stop them and make sure his plan comes through.
You can tell this all-star cast was handled well, providing story, action, laughs, and even tears. A few of these heroes sacrifice themselves for others. They get to reconcile themselves over past mistakes, regrets, and get to redeem themselves. They are reunited with loves ones lost five years ago when Thanos snapped his fingers. And they fight together against a foe for the first time since Avengers Age of Ultron. They were one team.
Someone could easily nit-pick this one, especially on the time travel. However, the ending brings so much satisfaction. Between the sacrifices, the second chances, the characters all have their resolutions tied up, with no post-credit scenes. Some of the character arcs are messy, but the movie provides an emotional satisfaction unheralded in motion picture history. Avengers Endgame gets a perfect score.",10,50,80,21 August 2019
Quantum of Solace," Three cheers for Fleming's Bond.
","James Bond returns for his 22nd adventure, picking up right after Casino Royale ended. However, while he finds leads, they are elusive, and mysterious. After his first lead dries up, he ventures to Boliva and finds his nemesis: an ecological terrorist bent on withholding natural resources from the native people of South America. He also meets his Bond girl, Olga Kuryenko. She vows revenge on the Hunta leader who slaughtered her family. The trail leads to a strange, bizarre group of powerful people in the world who desire to manipulate and control the economics of the world. Through terrorism? Through murder? It is still not clear, even at the end of the movie. There were several things I liked about this one. The first was Daniel Craig who plays Bond the way he was meant to be played: like a ruthless assassin. He does have a license to kill, right. This is also the first real sequel, keeping many characters from the previous one like M (Judi Dench), Mathis, and a frustrated, on-edge Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright). The fight scenes are fabulous, and the action scenes have more believability than most over-the-top Bond movies. I also liked the villain in this one because he was not bent on 'ruling the world' as so many Bond villains want. I have seen many critiques, blasting this film because it has 'borrowed' from Jason Bourne movies (does anyone notice a similarity in initials--also think about Jack Bauer from 24). I am sure it did influence Bond--mostly by bringing 007 a healthy dose of realism. The cartoonish and outlandish flamboyanies of Brosnan and Moore really grated on my nerves. There were a few downsides to this one. Some of the action shots were haphazard and incoherent. I think director Marc Foster, being so green, did not know how to shoot an action film. Many people are dissing this one because it lacks gadgets. Roger Ebert said he missed 'Q,' and the massive overbearing megalomaniac villains. Not me. You see, there are two types of Bond fans. The first type, like me, has read the books and short stories created by Ian Fleming. The second type are the ones who grew-up watching all the James Bond flicks (the good ones and the bad ones) for four decades. In all honesty, the latter (for the most part) was the Bond of Cubby Brocoli, not Ian Fleming. If you want the Brocoli Bond, then rent the videos with Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan to your heart's delight and enjoy the cheesiness. That way you can get the cheesy gadgets and megalomaniacs. If you want the Bond Fleming created, look to Quantum of Solace. It is not nearly as good as Casino Royale, but still up there.",7,1,3,20 November 2008
Batman Begins," The real Batman
","Batman Begins was a movie I liked marginally when I originally saw it, but have grown to like it better the more I see it. Christian Bale plays the renegade billionaire Bruce Wayne who mysteriously disappears for several years while studying the criminal mind and element in the Far East. He is found by Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), a member of the League of Shadows. This organization uses Ninja tactics and sees itself as the guardian of the world. The League of Shadows exists like a Star Chamber, taking actions against criminal elements government courts will not deal with. This secret league was responsible for the sacking of Rome, and the London Fire. Now, they wish to level Gotham City. Bruce barely escapes after learning their battle tactics. Returning to Gotham, he dedicates himself to ridding the city of Falconi, a ruthless crime lord who has the city in his grips for decades. In fact, the man who killed Bruce's parents worked for him at one time, making the stakes higher. Wayne uses his clout to look into weapon systems his company developed. He find some body armor. An unusual car. A cape. He forges them all into his new persona, Batman. While he brings down Falconi, someone else gets to him first: Dr. Jonathan Crane or the Scarecrow, played by Cillian Murphy. His gas agent causes people to go insane by releasing their worst fears. Apparently, he is working with the League of Shadows and release his chemical into the drinking water. We also meet a young cop named James Gordon (Gary Oldman), who is trying to go against the crooked police department. Another player is Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), an attorney who works for the city. This is how Batman should have been. Director Christopher Nolan deftly puts Batman into the real world. While I enjoyed Tim Burton's concept for Batman and Batman Returns, it was foreign - removed from reality into an uncertain time with uncertain technology. What Nolan does is give us not only circumstances, but also consequences for a man driven to the edge. I also enjoyed his use of non-linear time, which he seems to be a fan of. It keeps the audience interested and puzzled until the third act when it truly unfolds and fully makes sense. Also, Chrisian Bale does a wonderful job as a man conflicted. He hates the criminal mind and believes they should be stopped. Still, he cannot bring himself to kill those he hates. He also deals with his own hatred and propensity towards vengeance. The other performers also give great performances. Morgan Freeman is wonderful as the company man who leads Bruce Wayne to the interesting toys. He tells him how they work and how they should be used. Michael Caine gives the best performance as Alfred Pennwise, the faithful butler to Bruce Wayne. His charm, charisma, and dedication are portrayed so well. I was even moved by Gus Lewis as a young Bruce Wayne who took the role seriously and gave us a boy who truly blamed himself for his parents' death. The best scene is when Alfred comforts his loss. This was one of the best of the superhero movies of the last ten years. I hope the next one is done just as well.",9,5,6,11 March 2008
The Princess Bride," Wonderful!
","Director Rob Reiner may have created the most endearing romantic comedy of all time in his latest project, 'The Princess Bride.'Based on the book by William Golding, the story really begins with a young sick boy (Fred Savage) by his grandfather (Peter Falk) who reads to him 'The Princess Bride.'The real story is actually within the story (although we go back to the boy and his grandfather from time to time).The scenario is not distracting from the funny modern fairy tale. A young girl named Buttercup (Robin Wright) falls in love with the farm boy, Westley (Carey Elwes). They share true love. However, Westley must seek his fortune to marry her, so he becomes a sailor. His ship is captured by the Dread Pirate Roberts and he is no more.Although heartbroken, she agrees to an arranged marriage with Prince Humperdink (Chris Sarandon). Before the wedding, she is kidnapped by three men, Viccini, Indigo (Mandy Patinkin), and Fezik (Andre the Giant).Tracking them are two people: Prince Humperdink, and the Dread Pirate Roberts. The Dread Pirate initially wins, revealing himself to be the long-lost Westley. But Prince Humperdink pulls the upper ante to retake his bride and punish Westley.Westly must escape the torture chamber that awaits him and reunited with his true love. For help, he relies on Indigo and Fezik.The movie may sound convoluted, but even a young audience watching will understand how things unfold. Even better, they will laugh. Still, this is not the ultimate strength.The first are the characters that mesh well together like a song and dance. There is chemistry for humor, light-hearted conflict, and battles of wits. One of the best scenes is when Westley has a sword duel with Indigo. Fortunately, mutual respect and quick wits both prevent a duel to the death.Another is a hand-to-hand combat with Fezik, who is worried that his idea of sneaking up on Westley and crushing his head with a rock is 'not very sportsmanlike.'A subplot exists for Indigo as he seeks revenge against the six- fingered man who murdered his father. This leads to another great sword fight and one of the best lines in any movie.The only gripe is many of these characters talk so fast and with accents, it is had to understand them at some points. Of course, that will make you want to see it again.Another strength is the writing that gives a good romantic fairy tale as well as some good morals along the story. It is also not as predictable as some might think. What happens to the antagonist may surprise the audience.In any case, Rob Reiner has done it again. While 'Spinal Tap' is still his crowning jewel, 'The Princess Bride' serves both as good family fun and the perfect date movie.",10,1,2,9 April 2011
1941," Not all bad, but not great, either
","1941 is Steven Spielberg's take on comedy thrust upon the war nerves experienced by Californians following the first few days after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. This brings in an all-star comedy cast to deliver the fast and furious jokes that are almost non-stop. Unfortunately, the movie falls short of either comedic masterpiece, or cohesive storytelling. This is not to say the movie was a total washout, because there are some very funny moments, but that is not enough to save 1941 from itself. The all-star cast includes Tim Matheson, John Belushi, Dan Akroyd, Nancy Allen, Bobby DiCicco, Treat Williams, John Candy, Robert Stack and a slew of other Hollywood legends. The movie's comedy does work in many instances. One of the best scenarios developed well was Murray Hamilton trapped on a Ferris Wheel with Eddie Deezen and a dummy. Another was the tank group under the command of Sgt. Frank Trees played by Dan Akroyd. Probably the best was John Belushi as Wild Bill Kelso, a dimwitted Army Air Corpse pilot looking for Japanese in his P40 Tomahawk. And of course, there is a lost Japanese Submarine that wants to inflict damage on Hollywood. There are good performances, too. Belush is genius, conveying the lunacy and determination of someone who isn't all there. The communication in his eyes, and the way he thrust himself into the role is fantastic. Tim Matheson pulls off a great job, too, being a guy who wants to score with Nancy Allen on a plane. However, the comedy and performances are for naught. For the most part, the plot is too scattered and not focused. Let's see, Wally wants to dance with Betty, while Treat Williams tries to steal her away. Matheson is the horny guy who wants to score with Nancy Allen who has planes on the brain. A Japanese Submarine is lost while two guys are stuck in a Ferris Wheel and a tank team is trying to suppress a riot. Just who is the main character? There is no focus or cohesion to this story. It finally comes together towards the end, but it is too late for the lost audience who has to follow too many story lines. The other problem is the comedy, that does misfire. Spielberg gives us too many close-up shots of people screaming and yelling, somehow thinking this is funny. Moreover, the destruction is so overblown it becomes boring. Does Dan Akroyd have to shoot out every light? Again, this is not a total washout. It does have it's moments. Unfortunately, 1941 is one that is hard to fully dis, or fully recommend.",5,0,1,24 December 2010
Insidious," One of the best
","Insidious is the latest horror endeavor by the original Saw creator, James Wan, and Paranormal Activity producer Jason Blum that will literally terrify audiences. It revolves around Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson) and Renai Lambert (Rose Byrne as they move into a new home. Their oldest son, Dalton (Ty Simpson) is an adventurer who likes to explore. One night when venturing into the attic, he falls and hits his head. The next morning, he is in a coma. Unable to do anything, Josh and Renai bring him home to care for in the hope he will one day come out of it. Then, strange things start to happen. Strange noises occur. Faces appear. Things are moved. The alarm sounds. Strange happenings occur more frequently. After a while, they have had enough and move to a small house for lease. It does not help. Apparently, it was not the house that was haunted, but rather Dalton. More bizarre things happen - frightening things. At this point, they turn for help from Josh's Mom, (Barbara Hershey) and Elise (Lin Shaye). She explains the strange things that pervade: what is happening, why it is happening, and how to get Dalton back. This leads to a secret memory that Josh has buried (which was easy to figure out) and a terrifying venture into the spiritual world. Insidious, despite a few flaws is deft craft, using atmosphere, suspense, terror, and stunning visual imagery that will frighten the deepest part of your soul. This accomplishment is primarily done with Wan's wonderful direction that leaves an audience confused, guessing, and frightened. The performances by Wilson, Byrne, Shay, and Simpson are also good, giving the audience people to care about. The story is also engaging, slowly unfolding in a subtle way that keeps our interest. It is part Amityville Horror, part Poltergeist, part Exorcist, and a few other horror gems. The most stunning aspect is the imagery, especially when crossing over into the spirit world. It is not only frightening, but downright disturbing. Yes, it has a few flaws. The explanation offered by Elise seems too convenient and easy, as if writers assumed the audience HAD to know what was going on instead of leaving us in the dark to figure it out for ourselves. The 'surprise' for the audience is also weak, and is something that can be seen a mile away. Making up for these flaws is a disturbing terrifying movie that relies on suspense and fear instead of buckets of blood and guts. In the end I was exhausted by fear, and it took almost an hour after movie's end for the terror to fade. This is one of the few times a horror movie has infused a fear into my soul. I would rank this as one of THE most terrifying movies I have ever seen.",9,10,19,2 April 2011
X-Men: Apocalypse," Average
","In no way am I saying X-Men Apocalypse is a bad movie. However, with the glut of super-hero movies done well, this one is definitely in the average category. Apparently, Apocalypse was one of the first Mutants to appear a little more than 5,000 years ago in Egypt. With untold power, he was about to transfer his mind to another when the attempt was thwarted by his minions. It left him buried underneath the Earth until a cult reawakens him. Also discovering this long-forgotten mutant is CIA Agent Moriah MacTaggert (Rose Byrne). When the vault is opened it causes a world-wide tremor that alerts our favorite wheel-chair bound Mutant, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy). They reunite. At the same time, we find Erik/Magneto (Michael Fassbender) living quietly in Poland as a working man with a family. He has a wife and a child. However, he is discovered and local authorities kill (by accident) his new loved ones. His new anger makes him ripe for recruiting for Apocalypse who is seeking new minions. He also adds Ororo Munroe/Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Angel (Ben Hardy), and Psylocke (Olivia Munn). At the same time, other mutants make themselves available to counter the power-mad ancient Mutant. This includes Jean Grey (Sophie Turner), Scott Sommers (Ty Sheridan), Night Crawler (Kodi-Smit McPhee), Quicksilver (Evan Peters), Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), Hank McCoy/Beast (Nicholas Hoult) who all must band together to stop Apocalypse. The movie has some good things - mostly in McAvoy and Fassbender as Xavier and Lensher, respectively. Both men play their familiar parts with such adeptness and depth - especially Fassbender. Magneto is one of the best Mutant Villains because of his complexity, conflict, and pain. He is someone you can sympathize with, especially with the discovery of his family. Another great aspect are some of the supporting characters, especially Quicksilver who steals about every scene he occupies. He also has a great scene of his endeavor to save a bunch of young Mutants from an explosion. Jennifer Lawrence is probably the best, usurping the role from a quiet, sinister Rebecca Rojmin Stamos. Also, this one (like First Class and Days of Future Past) is wonderfully etched with the time surrounding the events. This time, it is 1983 where we have the musings of Return of the Jedi by the cadre of Mutants. However, as they ponder the points of the finale of the original Star Wars Trilogy, a huge hint of foreshadowing occurs when one of them says 'The third is usually the weakest of a trilogy.' They hit the nail head on. Not every trilogy ender can be an Iron Man III or Captain America III (and the Mutants could have used the Avengers help in this one). First, there are too many characters and sub-stories to follow. Just like Last Stand, do we need this many main Mutant characters? At a point, it becomes exhausting. And while Fassbender, Lawrence, and Peters are stellar, the rest of the Mutants don't have much depth. Another strike is the use of special effects over story and character. It is too much, especially towards the end with an over- the-top climax and resolution where the CGI distracts from the conflict. Moreover, one really has to know the whole plot line from First Class, Days of Future Past, and even the original X-Men Trilogy. In other words, this one is hard to watch unless you have seen ALL of those previous movies to know how they progress with the story arcs. I'm not saying it is a total washout. It is certainly no Spider Man 3, or even Last Stand, but it fails to deliver the depth, fun, story, and character the two previous installments offered. I still recommend it, just don't expect it to be as entertaining as previous installments.",6,0,5,3 June 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," What the heck?
","Spiderman's web misfires so much the web of the Amazing Spiderman 2 becomes too tangled, leaving comic and movie fans stuck in their tracks. It's not that the actors are bad. It's not that the story is weak. But execution always trumps the previous two elements. It does have some good things going for it. Andrew Garfield, Emma Thompson, Jamie Foxx and Sally Field have good talent and work well with what they have. Also, towards the end of the story, we have good action laced with good battles, and good conflict. The problem is it takes way too long to get there with uneven and hackneyed direction. The story begins with Peter Parker on top of the world, chasing bad guys with the public of New York mostly behind him. In one scene, he saves a nerdy Oscorp employee, Dillon Max (Jamie Foxx). He is so eager to be liked, he assumes he and Spiderman are friends and develops an unhealthy admiration. But when Oscorp kicks him to the curb - or rather into a vat of eels that is hit by power rods, he turns into Electro. When his powers spark (no pun intended) fear, Spiderman steps in and he is shocked (no pun intended again) that Spiderman is not the friend. Meanwhile, Harry Osborn returns home to see his father die from a debilitating disease. He finds out he has it and needs help. Unfortunately, the things he needs are not available - and he is forced out of Oscorp. At the same time, Spiderman/Peter Parker is discovering the truth behind his father's disappearance. Gwen Stacey is interviewing for a chance to go to Oxford Peter and Gwen's relationship is rocky - and so is the friendship between Peter and Harry. Understand the problem? All these stories fold unevenly, and behind way too many special effects that try to dazzle the eye. Then, plot holes pop up so large, Spidey could never plug them up with enough webbing. Hospitals and airports have their own emergency generators off the grid. In the end, we have a dark, violent Spiderman, far apart from the Raimi/Macguire Era. Moreover, Garfield does not have the nerdy quality that the original star had to nail the role. Frankly, too many villains, too many special effects, too long a movie all make The Amazing Spiderman 2 too terrible to watch. It might even make you prefer Raimi's final installment to this one.",5,12,26,2 May 2014
Dumb and Dumber," Great fun
","Dumb and Dumber would not be one of those movies destined to fit in the classics. Surely AFI would not want to put this one in the high-caliber humor hits in the history of movies. Still, Dumb and Dumber is one of the funnest comedies of the last 20 years. We meet Lloyd (Jim Carey) and Harry (Jeff Daniels). Both are inept, moronic imbeciles who plan to own a pet store called 'I Got Worms.' Good luck not only on raising the money, but even more on getting the loan. In any case, both have their odd jobs to get them through. Lloyd's life changes when he drives a woman, Mary (Lauren Holly), to the airport in his limousine, and she forgets her luggage. He decides to take it to her in Aspen, Colorado with the help of Harry. However, the luggage is actually ransom money for her husband. Harry and Lloyd have no idea, but they could really use the money since they have so little. They eventually discover it trying to find Mary, and on their tail are the kidnappers. It reminded me of a Three Stooges, Marx Brothers, or Abbot and Costello movie. However, with these guys, there is no straight man, nor any intelligence. This paves the way for idiotic miscarriages of common sense. Simply put, the audience will laugh because we can be assured that our intelligence is superior. This one also started the gross-out comedy. Looking back, the gross-outs in this one were not over-the-top. They were simple and much more plausible situations. Again, we can laugh because it is not us. There are no breakout performances, nor deft screen writing. Another strength for the movie is that it could work for kids as well as adults. Both ages can have fun with this movie--which is what I often watch on a snow day. Finally, let it be known that truth in stranger than fiction. I knew a guy in graduate school named Mike. In college I knew a guy named Jim. Put them together, you have Dumb and Dumber. However, I think they would have been smart enough to get on the bus at the end.",8,3,4,13 January 2008
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A Fun Star Wars Movie Despite Flaws
","You either love Star Wars, or your wrong. So who is wrong here? While the Last Jedi has polarized Star Wars fans, the movie is true to the spirit of overcoming odds against a despotic government.
The Resistance is licking its wounds, especially after a New Order attack. Poe defies orders of Leia Organa and is demoted. Now the Resistance fleet is plodding along with the General Hux and Kylo Wren slowly overtaking them.
Finn teams up with a new character, Rose to attempt to obtain a code breaker who can disable the Resistance flag ship. To do that, they must travel to a casino-type planet to locate him.
Meanwhile, Rey has found Luke Skywalker who is a jaded, old, cynical crumudgeon. He wants her to leave so he can guard the ancient Jedi Temple and texts. He lives off the land and sea. He learns of Han's demise, and sneaks past Chewie to see the Millenium Falcon once again. Artoo somehow rekindles him to help Rey learn the ways of the Force. However, he is full of self-doubt and fear because of his failure in teaching Ben Solo (Kylo Wren). During this time, Rey and Kylo make visits with each other via the Force.
At the same time, Finn and Rose locate DJ, a code breaker who could possibly help them. They return, but hope seems dashed as the New Order slowly closes in on the Resistance fleet.
All the elements come together for both, epic space battles, as well as a planet battle with walkers, and a light saber duel for the ages.
I will get gripes out of the way. First, Leia uses the Force to save herself, but it was pulled off in a cheesy and lazy way. It strained credibility not to her or the story, but to the lazy writing of Rhian Johnson. He also convolutes the plot in Finn and Rose's venture to the casino planet which not only seemed very out of place, but also hindered the plot and flow of the story. Finally, Johnson's writing almost gives us an incredible scene of self-sacrifice, but then derails it for another cheesy, lazy scene.
Fortunately, there are more positives than negatives. Mark Hamill shows some real talent, showing someone so jaded and unsure, that he fears taking on a new student. His acting is superb, besting his performance in The Empire Strikes Back. Also, Rey is a real sympathetic character who wants to do right, but still struggles with her own doubt and fear. What I really enjoyed was how Kylo Wren's character was fleshed out more. We learn of his training with Skywalker and how it went wrong, and of his torn conflict of befriending Rey while despising his Sith Master, Snoke. This part keeps an audience guessing, too, as to what choices Kylo Wren will make. Adam Driver really delivers a great performance on this one.
Also, just like the Empire Strikes Back, we learn a lot more about the Force and what it can do - without the long exposition scenes prevalent in the Lucas prequels.
The ending's ambiguity will leave some fans cold, but hopefully pique the interest of future audiences. Who knows where the Millenium Falcon goes next? Or what will the Resistance do after they are almost decimated? If Johnson continues his partnership with the Star Wars universe, he needs to look to other screen writers for help. However, I still look forward to episode nine.",7,1,3,21 December 2017
The Dark Knight," The Real Batman
","The Dark Knight is the best summer movie since ... okay I don't know when because its been too damn long since a outstanding summer release has overwhelmed me. It picks up right after Batman Begins. The Dark Knight (Christian Bale) is combating evil as rival gangs vie for the missing Falconi. Batman has inspired the people, police, prosecutors, and government officials with hope. A few idiotic copy-cats also join the fray, much to Batman's chagrin. Enter the Joker (Heath Ledger). His contention is that the criminals have lost their edge because Batman is alive. His solution: kill Batman. One of the people who has caught Batman's hope is the new police commissioner, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and District Attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). In fact, Batman hopes that as Dent and Gordon become the white nights for decency, Gotham will no longer need Batman. Dent starts to fall for Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhal). A cat-and-mouse game ensues, intertwining Batman, Joker, Dent, Rachel, Gordon, Fox (Morgan Freeman) and Alfred (Michael Caine). I don't want to give away any more of the plot because it is so well done and does not fall into predictable pratfalls and plots prevalent in summer movies. What it does, though, is give us good performances, great writing, outstanding directing, and a great time at the movies. At the outset, this is gritty Batman. It is nothing like the Tim Burton or Joel Schumacher takes which thrust Batman into a fantasy world removed from our own. It is real. That is especially true for Batman himself. For a change, we get to see a bloodied and bruised crusader who has to stitch up his wounds and clean blood. The frightening aspect, though, is the presence of evil. The Joker is truly menacing, diabolical, and frightening. Heath Ledger's performance is outstanding, giving us a glimpse into random, chaotic, no-holds-barred evil. His plotting is genius, bordering on insanity. There is no real joke or humor in Ledger's Joker. Aaron Eckhart also shines as Dent. His tragedy that scars his life and turns him into Two-Face. As we look into the this twisted relationship between Batman, Dent, and Joker, we can see where heroes and villains are similar, and different. While Batman and Dent find hope in their war against evil, the Joker simply wants to prove everyone is evil and no better than his own dark soul. I will admit the dialog gets a little corny at the end, but nowhere near the abysmally horrific diatribes George Lucas subjected us to in his Star Wars prequels. When Batman questions one crime lord, and later the Joker, he goes very far. I heard the audience rejoicing with this. They obviously knew Batman was willing to go far enough to stop evil. He is a Dark Knight instead of a white knight. Which one are we? Are we willing to do what we need to combat and stop evil? One of my favorite parts entails Alfred explaining to Batman that some men do not need a motivation for evil. Rather, 'they just want to see the world burn.' Probably my favorite dialog scene is when Batman interrogates Joker, who does want to see the world burn just to prove everyone else is just like him. This is stellar filmmaking. The only question is how can Nolan top this one? Enjoy it.",10,1,4,18 July 2008
Die Hard," One of the best
","I would rank Die Hard in the top three or two best action films of all time. Most people know the plot: New York Cop John McClane wants to spend with his kids in Los Angeles. His ex-wife's boss provides a limousine to bring him to the corporate party. During the party, a group of terrorists seize the building, sealing it off from the outside. They did not count on McClane being the wild card in the deck. Die Hard works in so many ways--better than most action films. First, it sets the standard and formula. After this one, we saw many adaptations of Die Hard on a boat (Speed 2, Under Siege), a plane (Con Air, Passenger 57), a train (Under Siege 2), a bus (Speed) and probably at least a half dozen more I can't think of. Second, the story draws us in. John McClane, played wonderfully by Bruce Willis, is someone we can identify with. He is smart, tough, and flawed. He bleeds, unlike Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarzeneggar. I cannot recall one movie in which the hero is totally bloodied like McClane is at the end. Third, there is a cool story with interesting characters. McClane's wife, Holly, is tough, strong, and we want them to get back together. She and Willis have good chemistry at the beginning when they talk and argue. We also have a headstrong Police Chief (Paul Gleason), the sensationalist Dick Thonrburgh, the insightful Sgt. Powell (Reginald Van Johnson), the overbearing and arrogant FBI Agents, and a very poised, confident heavy in Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman). The screenplay is also well-crafted, giving us a cat and mouse game as well as a battle of wits that does not degenerate to silly one-liners prevalent in Arnold and Sly movies. As story, screenplay, and characters all interact with director John McTeirean, we get a very credible, exciting vision of excitement and tension. Finally, there is a certain degree of believability to this one. Unforutnately, the believability was strained with each subsequent sequel. This is one of the best, bar none.",10,1,1,4 February 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Only Decent Prequel
","The good thing about Attack of the Clones, is that Lucas could only improve. That he did with his third installment, Revenge of the Sith. In this outing, war has broken out. Separatists, led by General Greivous, have split the Republic. Now with a standing army of clones, Emperor Palpatine has them dispensed to quell the uprisings. Secretly, though, Palpatine is the one behind the separatist movement - using them to give himself emergency powers. While the Jedi oversee the clone troops, the Emperor works against them. Enter Anakin Skywalker and Ben Kenobi who are trying to bring the war to an end. Skywalker kills Count Dooku, leaving Palpatine without an apprentice. He takes interest in Anakin as Ben Kenobi tries to locate General Greivous to bring the Separatist Movement to an end. That is when Palpatine seduces Anakin to the dark side, promising him a way to keep alive the ones he loves. After Kenobi finally brings an end to the separatist military leader, though, Palpatine does not relinquish power. Anakin discovers he is a Sith and brings Mace Windu in. However, tempted again by the Dark Side, Anakin ascends to Palpatine's apprentice. He must now rid the galaxy of Jedi. Kenobi somehow returns, then follows a pregnant Padme to the planet of Mustafar where Anakin is. Yoda confronts Palpatine, and loses. However, Kenobi defeats Anakin, rendering him to a life forever in a special life- support suit. Padme gives birth to twins that will be kept in hiding. Yoda exiles himself. This is a dark episode of Star Wars - as well as the most violent. It also has better dialog, especially when the Emperor is tempting Anakin. The plot is much more streamlined, and there is an even pace of the story. True, some of the exposition involves people sitting and talking, but there is more action interlaced with the plot. The acting, too, is not very deep. It keeps the audience from getting completely involved in the conflicts and temptations, but the performances are not as wooden and the previous installments. Overall, though, Revenge of the Sith was a decent, watchable prequel. It was not as stellar as the original trilogy, but still entertains far better than Phantom Menace and Attac of the Clones.",7,1,1,26 February 2016
Inception," Great movie
","Christopher Nolan's latest venture, Inception, is everything Hollywood needs: human story, cool special effects, and an original idea. The movie works on so many levels it cannot help but be entertaining. Cobb (Leonardo DeCaprio) is a thief. However, he does not steal jewelry, bonds, money or cars, but ideas. He does this by visiting the dream scape of his victims. It has to be done in a clever way because some people are aware of this type of crime. Not only are there natural defenses in our dreams, but trained ones as well. His team is made an offer, though. The offer comes from Sato (Ken Watanabe) who wishes to do the opposite: he wants to plant an idea in a rival competitor, played by Cillian Murphy. Now Cobb's team must invade Murphy's dream. The movie works on so many levels. In the first place, we must learn the rules. For example, someone entering a dream cannot draw attention to themselves or alter the dream from their psyche or the dreamer will catch on. The dreamer also has 'memories' that act as defenses, much like White Blood Cells that fight infections. Also, five minutes in real time equals something like an hour in dream time. You can invade a dream on two levels, or have a dream within a dream. The invaders must keep some sort of physical device and hold it to memory within the dream to make sure they are dreaming. Then there is the story of relationships gone awry. In fact, we learn the dreams are ways of dealing with past traumas. Cobb must learn to deal with his own baggage. This relates to the death of his wife and the alienation from his children. Unfortunately, they manifest themselves when he tries to invade the dream of others. What I truly like about this film was the metaphysical questions that deal with guilt, love, loss, and fear. What makes all these things work so well is the even-handed direction and screenplay of Nolan that keeps our interest piqued, but at the same time does not reveal everything. It also has a very dark element without being cynical or depressing. Instead, there is redemption. Nolan keeps getting better without falling backwards like M. Night Shymalan has done over the last half-decade. This is equally true in his writing as well as his directing. He is truly the best director out there at this time.",9,1,2,16 July 2010
Halloween," Favorite horror movie of all time
","There are two movie experiences I will always cherish. The first was seeing 'Star Wars' for the first time at the age of 10 with my little brother. A close second is sneaking into Halloween at the Tripple Plex with my good friend, Trevor, in late October 1978. Halloween left me breathless, speechless, and downright scared. Everyone knows the story. Young Michael Myers decides to kill his sister on Halloween 1963. He escapes a mental hospital 15 years later to return to Haddofield to wreck havoc once again. He spots Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis), a shy senior who enjoys babysitting, and begins stalking her. Her partying friends across the street are killed, one-by-one as Michael sets his plot to get her. Ironically, the young boy she tends on Halloween is afraid of the 'Boogeman,' and can see him outside. During the murder spree, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) works hard to find Michael before he unleashes his fury. He has no proof, no evidence, just a hunch he has to sell to Sheriff Bracket (Charles Cyphers). As the plot unfolds, you have a suspense-driven movie instead of a cheap thrill scare. Alfred Hitchcock once said, 'You can have four men at a table playing cards and they don't know there is a bomb and it goes off. That is a cheap thrill. However, put four men at a table who discover a bomb and discuss what to do about it--then it doesn't go off, then you have suspense.' Director John Carpenter takes that advice to the hilt in Halloween. The audience will see glimpses of him outside, watching, stalking his victims. We gasp. Will he kill her? When will he kill her? Then, Michael disappears. Carpenter also uses the suspense in lieu of special effects that usually highlight the gore. This movie has little blood, but still provides good scares. One of the best scenes is Michael lifting Bob off the ground. He rears the knife back as it glints off the moonlight, then he drives it. All you hear is a loud thud, then the audience sees Bob's feet drop lifelessly. Carpenter was the first to use a vantage point from the scene of the killer. This also peaks our audience. What will he do? What's going on inside his mind? Finally, Carpenter's hauntingly masterful score adds to the tension. Moreover, the tandem screen writing he did with Debra Hill gives us a story which develops characters we care about. The teens are not 'party mad,' but merely going through the rebellious angst of teenage wasteland. Finally, there is some decent acting in this 'B,' low-budget thriller. Nick Castle who plays 'the Shape' (Michael) adds something to the mindless killer. It is cold, merciless, and without any pathology. Moreover, the personality does everything the same way. He kills only when trapped, or to set up a trap. He splits the victims apart. He also relies on brute strength. And that mask used (a bleached William Shatner mask) gives an impression of something that has no soul or emotion. While Pleasance is melodramatic in his deadpan monologues, he comes across as someone scared, desperate, and determined. It made me wonder if he represented modernism's fading attempt to explain evil. The crown jewel, though, is Jamie Lee Curtis' debut. She plays the Laurie character as someone scared, but also determined and strong who fights back. The end is one that left me speechless. This was the first concept of an indestructible serial killer who could not be stopped. Movies like Star Wars have the advantage that it can be enjoyed numerous times. Halloween, and other scary movies, though, do not have that advantage. So if we could erase our minds of the first time we see a movie to experience it again as fresh and new, Halloween would be the movie I would choose.",10,8,11,29 December 2007
Wonder Woman," A Good DC Movie
","Not since 2012's Dark Knight Rises has the DC cinematic universe shined like this with Wonder Woman. Gal Gadot stars as the iconic character of Diana, the Amazonian who fought for justice throughout the ages of comics. In this modern re- telling, the Amazonians are immortal women who reside on a secret island, hidden from the world. Born of the Greek Gods, they have Herculean qualities in combat, strength, and character. Eventually, they are accidentally discovered by soldiers fighting in World War I - the War to end all Wars. After a skirmish battle, we find Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) as the lone American who is helping the British cause against the Germans. At the same time, a sinister German known as Ludendorff (Danny Hutson), and his sadistic cohort of chemical warfare, Dr. Maru (Elana Anaya). They have a new chemical gas agent that can really turn the stalemate in World War I. As Diana thrusts herself into this war to stop it, she automatically thinks the Greek God, Ares is behind it. He is the God of War. If he is stopped, it would bring the war to an end. As she learns of the plot, she knows that Ludendorff must be him. Diana, though, is not only naive about the outside world but also impatient with the politics behind waging war. She always wants to do the right thing, and it has to be now. Steve has to temper her, and teach her the ways of how the world works. There are a few faults with the movie. The first being the run time of 2 hours and 40 minutes. That is a long run time that may leave the kids squirming in their seats. Also, Steve Trevor's secretary, Etta Candy (Lucy Davis) is wasted for a few measly minutes for brief comedy as opposed to being a full fleshed out character. Also, as Diane adjusts to British Society, especially the fashion, she is a fish out of water (or should I save that for an Aquaman review?). Some of the comedy misfires. However, making up for these errors are the way Wonder Woman conflicts with British Society. She thinks Etta is a slave since she 'has to do what Steve tells her.' Diana is shocked that women are looked at with disdain and as many British officials disregard her and consider her an intrusion into 'men's work.' For the record, women had no vote in the United Kingdom until after the close of WWI. Fortunately, one of my high praises is the message of feminism does not exceed to male bashing as did last summer's 'Ghostbusters' reboot. Instead, Diana works as a team member with other men under Steve's command. She earns respect, and gives it to the men around her. There is also a good melding of the use of time element, which is reminiscent of Captain America, The First Avenger. Wonder Woman, though, is pulled off much better. Probably the best thing is the characters and actors. Finally, we care about DC characters. Gal Gadot finally gives us a comic hero we can identify with, something lacking in Man of Steel. She is not larger than life, and brings a sincerity to the role. Chris Pine, who often relies on charm, gives us a character we can identify with as the hero who wants to do the right thing, and must come to terms with a strong female presence in his life. This is also a bright movie, unlike most DC outings. Man of Steel had much introspection and brooding. Batman v. Superman was incredibly dark as the two big ones battled for supremacy. Even Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy was a bit bleak. Green Lantern was just plain silly. So see Wonder Woman. See it again. And maybe a third time. It is the most re watchable of the DC universe, and a good time at the movies.",8,38,105,7 June 2017
The Dark Knight Rises," Best Trilogy Ending Ever
","Despite a few flaws, the Dark Knight Rising brings a spectacular end to the best trilogy - and catapulting Christopher Nolan as the premiere movie maker of the last ten years. It is eight years after the Dark Knight has ended. Batman has disappeared, and Bruce Wayne has become a recluse. However, bringing the caped crusader out of retirement is the last remnant of the League of Shadows: Bane (Thomas Hardy). He was born in a pit-like prison and clawed his way to freedom. The price is a morphine inducing mask to keep him from feeling pain. While brilliant, he is also brawn - and a formidable opponent for the Dark Knight. Also in the mix is the mysterious Selena Kyle (Ann Hathaway), a jewel thief cat burglar. As usual, she is the amoral hero, only looking out for her self-interest, but not totally void of doing good. Bane puts Batman to the test, actually injuring him in the process. Now Bruce Wayne must heal, recuperate, and claw his way back to fight for the city he loves. Bane not only defeats Batman, but also puts Gotham in a vice-like grip, using a nuclear device to hold them hostage. He attacks the two things America loves the most: money, and sports. All this leads to an intriguing story that unfolds over two hours and 45 minutes. I did have two gripes. First, and the most problematic, was the noise and music that sometimes drowned out character dialog. In fact, Bane's mask upped that even more-rendering many of his words very dissonant. The second was that the plot got a little too labyrinth, offering too many twists and turns. Some plot devices can be seen from far away, but others seem to have Nolan trying to out-do his masterful twists in his 2006 masterpiece, the Prestige. On a lesser note, I found Joker much more interesting as a vicious, plotter bent on playing games to prove that everyone else is like him. Bane is straight forward and uses brute strength, usually drawing people into his trap. Also, the idea of Batman breaking his back and recuperating so quickly strained belief. All that aside, though, the finale brings us closure and full round back to the original Batman Begins - even bringing cameos by Rhas A Ghul (Liam Neeson), and Bruce Wayne's father. This is not done with clichés, but rather good storytelling that unfolds evenly with plot, motive and interesting characters. It is also layered. Yes, the Avengers had its layers - but it was mostly in a clash of egos between heroes, and Captain America losing his faith in military leaders above him. However, the issues in Dark Knight Rising are far deeper. One of those is to remind both Gordon (Gary Oldeman) and Bruce Wayne of their failure of making a lie their greatest victory. And Wayne must repair some relationships with Alfred (Michael Caine) and Luscious Fox (Morgan Freeman). Then there is Miranda Tate and John Blake (Joseph Gordon Leavitt), a Gotham Police Officer who realizes that Bruce Wayne and Batman are one and the same. So go see it. See it twice, maybe even a third time. This is the art of film, not just a movie.",9,4,10,20 July 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Batman and Superman Winners
","Just like the critics and fans, Batman and Superman duke it out for supremacy in the DC Universe. Despite its flaws, the Dawn of Justice does justice to the two heroes. Batman is on a vendetta against Kal-El/Clark/Superman. The collateral damage from the most recent Superman has cost many lives, many of whom were close to Bruce Wayne/Batman. He now worries about the unchecked power of Superman. So does the United States. When Superman has to save Lois (big shock, right?), some more collateral damage happens somewhere in Africa. Now the U.S. Congress wants to meet with Superman and discuss this immense power, since they think with great power comes great ... wait ... wrong franchise. Still, you get the idea. As Batman investigates some strange activities of Lex Corp and its founder, Lex Luthor, he meets the reporter, Clark Kent. Of course, he has his own agenda, wishing to investigate the Bat Vigilante who operates outside the law. In fact, when Wayne and Kent meet, the young reporter is already on to him. Also, a new casual observer is growing curious, as well as stirring up curiosity: a meta human who will be known as Wonder Woman. Finally, we have a Lex Luthor who has created an elaborate plot to pit the two against each other. We have a battle, a team-up, and the defeat of a bigger threat known as Doomsday. Fresh from the genes of General Zod, it wreaks havoc in Metropolis, so only the two heroes, I mean three, stop him. First, I want to get my gripes out of the way. First, the trailer for the movie pretty much gave away the whole plot - so thanks a ton, Warner Brothers. Second, Jessie Eisenberg as Lex Luthor will have people considering him for a prestigious award: a Razzie. While Gene Hackman went with camp and humor, and Kevin Spacey went with more sinister, Eisenberg gives us a loopy Lex Luthor who has Tourette's Syndrome. There is also some lazy writing within the screenplay, as they could not execute the story as well Marvel writers have. Instead of focusing on our three superheroes, they pull some tricks out of left field to introduce Flash, Aquaman, and another hero I am unfamiliar with. However, it has a lot going for it. The most controversial casting decision, Ben Affleck as Batman, was the best choice. He owned that role, playing it to perfection. It even rivaled Christian Bale's take on the role. Henry Cavill as Superman is no Christopher Reeve, but he plays the role more for complexity and not so much as comical. Clark and Superman are much closer to each other. Moreover, unlike Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth, Cavill and Adams have a good chemistry as Lois and Clark/Superman. Another good aspect was the fights and the action. While Doomsday went a little over the top, at least it was entertaining and fun to watch. And the fights between the two leads are both entertaining and done with a much greater level of believability than the Doomsday fight. The movie was drawn out a little long, especially the ending that will still pique the audience's attention. So that part did work for me. I just wish the writers could have found a way to shorten the path. Overall, despite these mistakes, Batman v Superman is one to watch for the ages. I look forward to the next one.",6,6,13,2 April 2016
Casino Royale," Craig saves the day!
","After Die Another Day, I thought Bond was finished. Daniel Craig proved me wrong when he took the role by the horns and brought Bond back to what he really was: a ruthless assassin. We begin when Bond gets the status he needs to be a 00 agent. We then move to Africa where Bond is after someone who was paying off someone who makes money off terrorism. It eventually leads him to Bermuda, where he must wine, dine, and dazzle the women to find a nefarious plot to take place in Miami. There, he learns of a plot to destroy a plane. The hope of the financier is to manipulate the stock market so he can get rich and finance more terrorism. His last ditch effort is to make headway at a poker tournament at Casino Royale in France. Bond teams up with a beautiful Vespa (Green) whom he falls for. It eventually leads to a mysterious plot twist that keeps the audience on the edge of their seat. In the first place, Craig is definitely what the fans wanted in Bond. We no longer have a pretty boy who makes wise-ass comments for mere laughs, but rather out of an overly masculine ego. Craig also makes the role very physical. This is the first time when you see Bond bloodied, bruised, in pain, and vicious. The fights are so well choreographed, the audience will really feel pain and appreciate the physical prowess it would take to be an agent. My only gripe was that the movie was drawn out a little too long. Other than that, Bond returned to the top of his game. My hat is off to Craig. I hope he can continue this momentum.",10,1,6,5 February 2008
X2: X-Men United," One of my favorite super hero movies
","X-2 is one of those rare sequels that outshines the original. I liked the original X-Men. While it was good, X-2, X-Men United is superb. It picks up where X-Men left off. Logan (Wolverine) is returning from his quest to discover his origin. Meanwhile, a new Mutant, Kurt Wagner (Nightcrawler) makes at attempt on the President's life. Enter Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox), who vows to stop the Mutants for good. Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) asks for Dr. Jean Grey (Fahmke Jansen) and Storm (Halle Berry) to find this new mutant. Meanwhile, he must consult with his old nemesis, Eric Lynch, or Magneto (Ian McKellan). Dr. Xavier and Cyclops, aka Scott Sommers (James Masden) are captured by Stryker. At the same time, a hit squad goes after the young Mutants at Dr. Xavier's school. Barely escaping are Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Rogue (Amanda Paquin), Iceman, and Pyro. Then, Magneto escapes with the help of his co-hort, Mystique (Rebecca Rojmin Stamos). The plot may seem labyrinth, but it works well, again showing why Marvel superheros always outdid DC Comics. In the first place, Mavel characters are reluctant heroes, often having a downside to their power. Rogue can never touch another human being, isolating herself from others. Cyclops can never look at someone with his own eyes. Second, the Marvel superheroes are thrust into the real world. People fear them, hate them, and want them relegated to the fringe of society. The movie also goes deeper, cutting into society and their reaction to the Mutant 'threat.' In X-Men, the villain was Bruce Davison who plays a Senator reminiscent of Joseph McCarthy who used the Red Scare in the 1950's to alienate his enemies as 'Communists.' In X-2, the villain is Stryker. He does not want to use politics, he just wants to eradicate the Mutants--more like Slobodan Milosovec. The movie also takes the end of the struggle for equity. In both movie, it seems Dr. Xavier has the idealism and hope of Dr. Martin Luther King, whereas Magneto is a separatist who strikes back like Malcom X. Laced between the depth is a good-paced story with credible acting, good action sequences, and special effects that do not overshadow the story. The performances are another praise. James Marsden actually does a decent acting job as Cyclops. Ian McKellan is able to make the audience sympathize with Magneto, despite the character's cynicism and dubious methods. Brian Cox also does well as the real heavy. For a change, the villain is not over the top or a megalomaniac. He is the true, subtle type of evil--convincing himself he is doing society good. Rebecca Rojmin Staimos does her acting with her moves and stare--emitting a subtle, yet powerful evil. On the other hand, Alan Cummings gives us a Mutant who not only has a love of life, but also a faith that does not come off as self-righteous or preachy. X-2 may lack a beginning, middle, and end, but it works so well as a great superhero movie.",9,2,4,14 February 2008
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force Awakens Fans
","After two of the three prequels seriously bored and unimpressed audiences, and the third garnering a little more attention, the Force is back and Star Wars awakens the stupefied and disappointed audiences. No longer are we laden with inane expository dialog, wooden characters, and uneven direction. Star Wars - The Force Awakens has given the franchise a serious shot of adrenaline. It starts about 30 years after Return of the Jedi. The Empire has retrenched itself with the First Order, while the Rebellion has also has turned into the Resistance. In charge of the First Order, is Kylo Wren, Dark Jedi who is prone to fits of anger and is laden with a mysterious, dark past. Wren, along with General Leia Organa of the resistance, are searching for Luke Skywalker, who mysteriously disappeared years ago. The search begins on Jakku, a desert world where scavengers trade old scrap pieces for a day's food. We meet Ren, a loner who seems to long for someone to return in her life. A few people do come into her life: Poe, a resistance pilot looking for Skywalker, BB-8, a droid with some secret information, and Finn, a former Stormtrooper who develops a conscience and decides to leave the First Order. To escape, they must use an old familiar flying hunk of junk. Once they do, they meet the actual owner, a lonely, older smuggler we have grown to know and love. Once he learns of the quest, he decides to help. He eventually reunites with Leia and works to launch a strike against the First Order's new weapon: a Star Killer (a really, really large Death Star, which is actually a hybrid of a natural planet along with technology). It is in this adventure that draws the old and new cast together. Backstory is revealed, characters are developed, and some twists and turns spring up without it being corny or sappy. As the characters mesh with the story, direction, and effects, we are left with a thrill ride laced with great humor. There were a few strikes against the movie. In the return of Han Solo, we have another back story that evolves into a muddled mess with strange alien creatures that was forced. Another was the fallback to use another Death Star. Although it was done slightly different, the Empire or First Order should probably give up on this idea as the rebellion has been able to destroy three out of three. J.J. Abrams and his team have reinvigorated another sci-fi franchise, proving George Lucas was the biggest weakness in the prequels. In this day of bloated special effects, weak stories, and wooden characters, this one returns Star Wars to its majesty of yesterday. Now if we can just wait for the sequel.",9,4,21,24 December 2015
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Greatest movie of my generation
","Seeing Star Wars for the first time on the big screen way back in 1977 was the defining movie experience of my generation. At that time, I was ten, my brother was eight. We were both mesmerized, hypnotized, and captivated by a wonderfully simple yet epic story. It was a simple idea of good over evil, rescuing the helpless, discovering adventure, mammoth technology and sword and sorcery. Luke was the boy we could all identify with. Ben Kenobi was the wise leader. Han Solo was the cool, quick-witted pirate. Chewie was the faithful sidekick. The droids were great comic relief. The princess was smart and strong. And those light sabers were so cool. The movie is timeless, transcending generations. More than 30 years later, it still works magic, wonder and awe with new generations all the time. It can still be enjoyed time after time after time. It is definitely my favorite movie of all time.",10,1,2,27 January 2008
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Probably better than Star Wars
","Call me blasphemous, but cinematically, The Empire Strikes back is far superior to the original Star Wars. We pick up shortly after the destruction of the Death Star. The Empire has dispatched probe droids to find the rebels. One probot finds a base on the remote world of Hoth. Frustrated, the rebels must bug out. Commander Luke Skywalker and his flight team make their stand against giant AT-AT Walkers and Imperial Snow Stormtroopers. Meanwhile, Leia cannot get to her transport, so Han Solo must get her out on the Millennium Falcon. Darth Vader is obsessed with finding Skywalker so he wants the Falcon. He will stop at nothing--even asteroids. Vader tracks them to Bespin where Han hopes an old friend, Lando can help out. However, Vader beat them there and force Lando to turn them over. Luke ventures to Dagobah to meet Yoda, the Jedi Master. There he undergoes training to be a Jedi. As he learns to focus the Force, he has a vision of Han and Leia suffering in a city in the clouds. He leaves training prematurely to face Vader. He is not ready. And he learns of Vader's secret. Star Wars was an introduction and The Empire Strikes Back goes deeper. At the outset, we learn more about the Force and how it can help. It was only vaguely touched on in the first one. We also learn more of Vader's sinister side. In the first one, his presence and appearance exuded evil. In this one, he demonstrates it through dispatching the Empire officers who fail him. We also get to see Leia and Han grow closer. Their love blossoms and grows. They had real chemistry. Finally, Luke really grows. He is the impatient, naive, and adventurous boy. He suffers for his decision. This forces him to mature. While some people found Chewabaca's incessant howling over the fate of Han Solo, I found it touching, giving the great side-kick alien depth and soul. The magic of Star Wars is unmeasurable. It was great swashbuckling fun with age old themes of good triumphing over evil. It allowed us to escape and be struck with wonder and awe. Empire, though, is thoughtful, deep, analytical, and fun. The audience will identify with Luke, Han, Leia and Chewie all the more because of their suffering. At this point, they were no longer larger than life, but human. I compare this to falling in love. With Star Wars, the infatuation and lust begins. With Empire, the love deepens and becomes solid. If it never happened, the love would not mature. This is Lucas truly at his best. I hope he recaptures this someday.",10,5,10,24 January 2008
Contact," One of my favorites of the 1990's
","I will go a step further and say this is one of my favorite movies ever. I found it though-provoking, awe-inspiring, deep, thoughtful, analytical, and powerful. Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) is a young, gifted scientist who is eager in finding the proof of extra-terrestrial life. This has been her ambition since the death of her father. She cannot fathom a universe so big without any other life, considering it a 'waste of space.' Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey) is a religious leader who crosses paths with her. Ironically, while he believes in God, Ellie is an atheist and demands proof of the existence of everything. At odds with Ellie is Dr. David Drumlin (Tom Skerrit) who keeps pulling the funding from Ellie's crusade. He eventually becomes the White House Adviser on Science. Suddenly, Ellie finds the proof she has been looking for. A definite signal comes from the star, Vega, which is roughly 26 light-years from Earth. They apparently intercepted a signal, then sent it back with their own schematics for a device that will likely transport someone somewhere. The White House takes over this project, and several nations join to build the massive device. Of course, Ellie wants to go, but vying for the honor are several others and she must compete. Then, the politics begin. The politics behind building and technology rights, who will go, and who will implement public policy. Some people expect hostile aliens, others consider them friends, and many people see it as the ultimate religious experience. I like this movie for so many reasons. At the outset is the politicking that goes on. It mirrors what the real world would be like if such a thing would happen. This leads to the wonderful acting that goes along with it. We all know the over-zealous pragmatist Mr. Kitz (James Wood), the level-headed White House Chief of Staff (Angela Bassett), the conservative religious leader Richard Rank (Rob Lowe), and the wise and insightful Kent (William Ficthner). We know a grand-stander and opportunist like Drumlin (Skerritt). What pushes this movie over the top, though, is the direction of Robert Zemickis. This is undoubtedly his best movie to date, even outshining his previous effort, Forest Gump. He adapts Carl Sagan's novel into a tour-de-force that not only lets us see how our society would truly react to such a thing, but also the dire consequences. He casts enough story, doubt, and confusion to make us wonder what really happened ... until the end. It also delivers a subtle, powerful message without being preachy or over-the-top. I left the movie theater awe-struck in a deep, profound way. I was scared, nervous, and moved. I have contended Contact was sorely over-looked in the Academy Awards because of the entertaining but over-hyped Titanic. It should have been nominated for best picture. Too bad. It was truly majestic ... and my favorite picture of 1997.",10,3,7,7 June 2008
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Great fun
","The first time I saw Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, I thought it was okay. The more I saw it, though, the more I liked it. Indiana Jones must find his missing father who was searching for the Holy Grail. Donovan (Julian Glover) dispatches Dr. Jones and Marcus (Denholm Eliot) to Italy where he meets Dr. Schneider (Allison Dody). After a couple of attempts on their lives, they find their way to Austria and locate the elder Dr. Jones (Sean Connery). The Nazis, too, are after the Holy Grail and kidnapped the elder Dr. Jones in hope to find his notebook. It eventually falls into their hands, giving them an edge on finding the ancient relic. This one has it all: fights, chases, comedy, the father-son relationship, beautiful women, and really mean bad-guys. While I liked Temple of Doom, I liked this one much better for several reasons. The first is the introduction in which we meet a young Indiana Jones played by River Phoenix. We learn how he got the scar, his morbid fear of snakes, and his adventurous impulses. The action sequences are also well done. The scene in the dungeon with the oil gives the audience a claustrophobic sense. Following is a great boat chase. There is also a good dogfight scene. The best is the tank scene when Indy is trying to rescue his Dad. Another thing I liked was that the female lead, Dody, was a strong woman who does not appear to be all she is. Not to give it away, but her romantic interests are selfish. This does not allow it to blossom into love, and keeps the movie from being predictable. Also, I liked the villain in this one. Julian Glover's depiction of Donovan is good, giving him a subtle sinister side along with some depth. I really liked Vogel (David Byrne) as the Nazi Commander. In the first movie, we hated the Nazis just because they were Nazis. Byrne, though, portrays evil, impatience, and anger so much better--making you loath him for his character. I liked the incorporation of previous stars like Denholm Eliot and John Rys Davis (Sallah) who were both in the original. Finally, I loved the chemistry between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery as the father and son who could not connect. They made it believable, funny, and entertaining. The best scene is when they are aboard a Zepplin and cannot think of a thing to talk about. I still contest that Raiders of the Lost Ark is a superior film, mostly because of the originality. But the Last Crusade is darn close to capturing that freshness once again.",9,0,2,28 January 2008
The Simpsons Movie," Woo-hoo!
","I've been waiting for the Simpsons Movie for a long time. To get it out of the way, I thought the Simpsons peaked about ten years ago. Therefore, I originally thought the movie was about ten years late. Fortunately, the Simpsons, Bigger, Longer and ... whoops. I mean the Simpsons Movie delivers. I recall seeing South Park, Bigger, Longer and Uncut in a vacuum, meaning I knew nothing about the show itself before seeing the movie, but still walked away somewhat entertained. If I was a fan first, I might have enjoyed it more. As for The Simpsons Movie, I think it has more direct appeal to the fans and probably won't find new ones. Essentially, Homer screws up Springfield once and for all by dumping pig poop into the Springfield Lake, forcing the EPA and President Scwharzneggar to encase the city in a plastic dome. Once the Simpson family is exiled, Homer must make up his mind who he cares about more: himself, his family, and the people of Springfield. All along, the story and pacing is laced with subtle satire, irony, and quick-witted lines the Simpsons is known for. It will make you laugh out loud, and like many Simpsons episodes, you might want to see it twice to catch all the jokes (be sure to stay for the credits, too). The only drawback is that it cannot be seen in a vacuum. You have to know about Homer's stupidity and impulsiveness, about Flander's religiosity, and about the cold-heartedness of C. Montgomery Burns. It also feels like a 90 minute Simpsons episode instead of being an actual movie. What it does not do is go overboard like South Park did in their profanity-laden movie. Instead of a relentless attack on the American Puritanical Culture like South Park, the satire is more subtle and not as cynical. The Simpsons evens pokes fun at the idea of a Simpson's Movie itself. The best part, though, is that the fans will definitely give a resounding 'Woo-hoo!' instead of 'D'oh!'",9,0,2,25 July 2008
