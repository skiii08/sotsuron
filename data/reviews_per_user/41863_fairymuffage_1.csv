The Longest Yard," How much of a rip off of mean machine is this
","this is incredible that it was allowed to air it is a total rip off of mean machine accept instead of football its American football. he gets chucked in the slammer after drunk driving after throwing a football match(hmm sounds familiar to mean machine I'm thinking) He then is told to make a team of convicts and he is then told to throw that game(very very suspicious) he starts to throw it then decides to win no matter what cost and a guard lets him off a life sentence.(oh my god am i the only 1 who's seen this before) UNBELIEVABLE how they have the identical story and get away with it, oh well that life, P.S mean machine was better because English football is better than American",1,1,3,21 September 2005
