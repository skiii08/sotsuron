Casablanca," true
","i am not a movie buff or aficionado but this movie is the best i have ever seen. if you have ever had you heart broken you will love this movie. was it about war? was it about mystery, who cares? never has there been a more romantic, truthful movie, where you, as in reality, lose the one you love. this movie is therapy for the single man. we all have that song that reminds us of someone special, we all cry about the one that got away. suddenly she walks back in your life. your true love and fate, and perhaps the fate of the free world is in your hands, what do you do? if your happily married this movie isn't for you, this movie is about the passionate, less fortunate who love never blesses.",10,1,4,22 May 2005
