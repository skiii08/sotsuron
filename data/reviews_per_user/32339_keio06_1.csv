The King's Speech," Crap
","Booooring storyline. Hard to keep awake as it was so boring and predictable. It really is hard to understand how this can receive so many nominations. I've ticked that it contains spoilers but it really isn't hard to know what happens: Man has a stutter, gets help, succeeds. The end. There really is nothing more to it. The best part of it is when his daughter says, 'splendid papa, just splendid'. The acting was good but not to the extent that people are raving on about!I would not recommend anyone to watch this, especially not at the movies. Save your money and watch the Black Swan instead! Best movie ever!!",2,27,63,3 February 2011
