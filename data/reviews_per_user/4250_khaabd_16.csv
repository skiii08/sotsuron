Ford v Ferrari," Oscar crime against Christian Bale
","I was so excited to see this movie and the fact that it never disappointed me, Because I really really enjoyed it from start to finish despite its relatively long duration, I think that watching this movie was one of the best moments in 2019 With the shock factor that was large and multi in all moments of the movie, Speaking of the performers' performance, the performance was very excellent, and this film is the best for Matt Damon for the martian a year 2015, As for Christian Bale, he deserves to run for the Oscars.
Finally, I wonder, why did filmmakers wait until 2019 to produce this movie and tell this legendary story",9,2,4,31 January 2020
Scarface," A timeless masterpiece not affected by time
","This is the second time I saw this movie, after the first time in 2005 and after watching it I discovered the value of this wonderful film, Which carries a lot of wonderful meanings with a positive and negative side, From an illegal immigrant has nothing to America's largest drug promoter, And many events that make you enjoy throughout the film without getting bored, and the film has increased the splendor of the performances of the actors and directors and the wonderful screenplay.",9,0,1,2 October 2019
A Star Is Born," A very boring film except a song Shallow
","The experience of Bradley Cooper in the directing was a bad reversal of what he was doing in acting, Expected events The output was very bad and the worst of that deprived us of the scene of suicide, the beautiful thing in the film is for song and acting only.",5,2,3,24 May 2019
Fight Club," A legendary film
","With the 20 years since the production of this timeless masterpiece, I saw it re-seen for the fourth time and written a review, I never hope to repeat it or change my perception of it, Not in terms of the story that is characterized by everything a film needs to be complete like drama and comedy, Also, I do not miss the cheating with the performance of the actors who was already a reference and the output, which does not disagree with two, Also, I do not miss the cheating with the performance of the actors who was already a reference and the output, which does not disagree with two.
Fight Club, reference movie",10,2,2,16 September 2019
Captain Marvel," It could have been better.
","What distinguishes the film is the acceleration of events, and I think the problem is in the scenario and not in the Director, Where the directors gave an average work thank him despite the absence of enthusiasm and the expected end, and there is a problem of visual effects where it did not live up to the required level.
I think Marvel is back at the best of this and I wish the best in the second part.",6,2,4,29 May 2019
12 Angry Men," A good movie compared to the year of production
","This kind of film is what we miss in our time, A very cool epic film that takes place in a single room, but it makes you live outside the room for the tight screening, good director and great performance, This is what makes us yearn for its wonderful end.But what made me retain it was not to tell us who the perpetrator was and why the witnesses lied, It would be better if there were scenes abroad with events and stories of witnesses from the jury room.
I have no objection to producing the film with a bigger budget and some of the scenes that increase the length of the film, and with a director like Christopher Nolan or david fincher.",8,1,1,25 September 2019
Us," Jordan Peele Continue to dazzle
","The film is good in all respects, especially the symbols presented as scissors, rabbits and red clothes, And thus the director presents his own touch in his films after the icon of the cup in his first film get out, In addition to the sequence of events and the process of linking events to the viewer, But it would be better if the director showed us the chaos that had taken place abroad and did not deprive us of it, with a focus on the family.We wait Jordan Peele in another movie and close, God willing",7,0,1,16 June 2019
Forrest Gump," A Movie studying ....
","Tom Hanks never disappointed in his movies, Two hours and twenty-two minutes I was never bored, The film has been crammed with many events, combining drama, romance, adventure, action, comedy and the thrill of what is the end, As the mother's tenderness and sacrifices teach us for her children and if they are disabled, Teach us the meaning of friendship, loyalty and kindness, this film will remain a catalyst and a masterpiece of art throughout generations and generations.",10,1,1,11 September 2019
American Beauty," A Realistic movie
","Once again with the classic films that remain immortal, the film offers us a realistic life with distinction Not just in America, but in every community in the world. The manifestations are deceptive and what we see with our eyes does not reflect at all conscious not in terms of marital or family life or work or anything else, I also do not fail to praise the performance of the actors and good directing.",8,0,0,23 September 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," As usual Tarantino does not disappoint me personally
","I really enjoyed the movie in all its stages from start to finish, Acting performance, soundtrack, director, story, 1960s decor, everything was so cool. In addition to the high-end dialogues that are a feature of Tarantino. And his clear touch in his good construction of the characters of the film, every character that you see the director clearly
What I'm keeping in mind is the length of the movie with some extra scenes that might make you bored.
We are waiting for your next movie with great passion",8,2,3,15 February 2020
Gone Girl," David Fincher As usual he did not disappoint
","Wonderful presentation of characters, excellent sequence of events, The dialogues were interesting and not boring compared to what we see in the mystery films, In my opinion the only drawback is the encounter with Amy Dunne and Desi Collings and the end where Amy Dunne did not receive what they deserve, so we do not know if there is another part or not",7,0,0,24 May 2019
1917," A movie that makes you live, moment by moment
","Since the movie was announced, it was clear that it is a film that has its place in cinematic artifacts, especially with the announcement of the starring team, And with the appearance of the first trailer, it was well confirmed, Film 1917 makes you live through the events and feel what the soldier feels from start to finish, Also, the performance of all actors, especially George MacKay Who deserves an Oscar nomination. But the most important thing remains the direct and indiscriminate directing of the method of filming that would otherwise have been an ordinary film in my view It suffices to name the director Sam Mendes. What is wrong with the movie is that it is a little slow, as if you feel that there is no struggle with time.
1917 is a masterpiece.",8,0,0,22 March 2020
2001: A Space Odyssey," Worth seeing only once
","The beginning of the film was good with fantastic soundtrack that predicted great suspense, Then the scene of the monkeys in the desert - like The orangutans, And the scene of transition from the old to the modern era was also wonderful, photography, visual effects and music is indisputable, My problem with the film remains the long, long scenes in frivolous dialogues and other scenes that were of little use, I also think that the film is very helpful to Darwin's theory, so I do not think the film deserves all the hype.",6,0,2,27 May 2019
Pulp Fiction," A symbolic movie par excellence
","This is my first time watching this movie, and I think I'm too late as a Quentin Tarantino fan, For a number of reasons, but after watching the film and despite the length of its duration, I did not feel it at all for the beauty of dialogue and high-end comedy, The film also requires a great focus, and contains many symbols and lack of sequence in the story and the audacity of the dialogues, Also, I can not fail to talk about the fine performance of all the actors and good director, What is wrong with the film is the persistence of a lot in the use of symbols and the presence of scenes have no importance.",8,0,1,18 September 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Not so dusty!
","First of all, the acting performance of all the actors must be commended, especially the one who played the role of JoJo. In addition to the last actors and good directing and the environment in which the events take place. But I think the story was ok and very normal and does not deserve all this cheering, in addition to that there is no comedy that makes you laugh despite the fact that the movie is rated comedy and there is not even a black comedy.
A film that has more political goals than anything else",6,3,5,15 February 2020
Green Book," For me, the best movie in 2018
","The film is good in all respects, a representative performance of all major actors especially the main duo We have missed films that address the issue of racism in comic ways, What only hurts is the length of dialogues that can be shorter
Oscar deserves the best in 2018",8,1,2,24 May 2019
