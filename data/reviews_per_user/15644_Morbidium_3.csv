Ghost," Had some ups and downs
","This is a decent fantasy/romance movie that has some interesting moments and good characters, although it felt like they couldn't find the right tune to tell it. Clearly a better and smarter screenplay could elevate this movie a lot, especially some dialogues were so out of place.I liked the chemistry between Patrick Swayze's character and Whoopi Goldberg's character, for me that was the strongest aspect of the movie. The other good thing about this movie was how they kept the story simple and focused. However, the drama never worked for me. Movie telling you how to feel all the time combined with cheesy romance and bad acting wasn't something that I can ignore. Totally Watchable!Best way to watch it: catch it on TV when spending lazy time on bed.",5,3,7,26 February 2017
Heat," Artistic and Classy!
","WOW! I wasn't expecting anything like that. I kept ignoring Heat for quite some time. This is a movie with no flaws, nothing is fake here, nothing rushed. Thrilling and chilling atmosphere from the start 'till the end. Where do I even start? From a 2h 50m long movie you'd normally expect some boring moments or silly, out of place humor to compensate that. But there were non. Pacing was incredibly accurate.The plot is generic and simple: two men from opposite sides of the law collide with each other. Those men are played by Al Pacino and Robert De Niro and they are at the top of their game (both actors and characters). Unlike many other movies we're not only told that they are good, we're shown! Each of them demonstrate why they are the best. Both crafted well and intriguing. All side characters are perfectly placed. It's a very risky move for a 3 hours long movie to take itself that seriously from the start to finish, but I think it paid off. And what a great casting choice, Al Pacino and De Niro both are very dedicated to their roles, they are not relying on their reputations.Other than great acting, storytelling, crafting a tension, pacing. There were 2 elements that elevated this movie to become a masterpiece: cinematography and score. Both are incredibly rich. Both are amazing by their own and when they unite with all those classy elements of the movie: THEY CREATE ART! This movie respects it's audience and never cheats.Best way to watch: spare some free time, get comfortable on the couch, be sure that you wont get disturbed. This is not an action movie that you watch with friends while chatting. This is not a background movie. This is intense.",10,3,6,26 February 2017
Beetlejuice," Entertaining as Hell!!!
","I grew up watching 80's and 90's movies on TV, and to be honest I've never seen Beetlejuice until recently. This is a movie that knows what it is and uses it properly. I like most of the Tim Burton movies and this one surely is one of them. The story starts as warm as 80's fantasy/family movies with a charming couple and it's followed by entertaining wtf moments. When Keaton joins the party it becomes wild with crazy tempo. I try to avoid reading plots and watching trailers as much as I can, and this time not knowing what's going to happen paid off. Adorable simplicity and short runtime makes Beetlejuice more and more re-watchable. I am giving it 8/10 and recommending to anyone with a little bit sense of humor who wants to spend some joyful time on colorful world with tingling soundtrack. Best way to watch: Late night, with anyone, anywhere.",7,2,3,26 February 2017
