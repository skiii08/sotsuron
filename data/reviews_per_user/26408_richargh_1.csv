The Avengers," Great popcorn flick
","Finally caught the Avengers. My thoughts... Overall, a good movie. Whedon made good use of every character, even the minor ones no one cares about (Black Widow, Nick Fury, Hawkeye). Action scenes were top-notch, especially those that involved Hulk. Amazingly prior to this, Whedon had not directed any blockbusters to speak of. Yet they chose him to handle a film of this magnitude, and fortunately the producers' confidence in him paid off because this movie was a home run. My only complaint was Capt. America and how useless he seemed, being overshadowed by the others. Just give Black Widow the shield, otherwise, having both on the same team was redundant. Anyway, I don't know who wouldn't be entertained by this film. Movies like this are the reason why we go to the cinema, so we have something to talk about afterward.",8,0,2,4 May 2012
