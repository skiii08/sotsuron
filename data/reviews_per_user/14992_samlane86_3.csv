Black Swan," The Black Swan
","The uninitiated might find it odd for 'ballet' and 'psychological thriller' to describe the same film. I did when I first heard of The Black Swan, though the idea intrigued me. Much of the intrigue was due to the film's director, Darren Aronofsky director of Pi, Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain, and The Wrestler. With a basic knowledge of the competitive nature of ballet, these descriptors make more sense. After watching The Red Shoes recently, I was even more interested in seeing The Black Swan. I wanted to see how the two films compare.Natalie Portman plays Nina Sayers, a dancer hoping to be awarded the lead role in a new production of Swan Lake. The director of the production, Thomas Leroy (played by Vincent Cassel), knows she has the precision needed to portray the white swan, but he unsure if she can let go and lose herself in the sensuality required for the evil twin, the black swan. Mila Kunis plays Lily, a new dancer in the company, who possesses all the qualities needed for the black swan. As the film progresses, the pressure on Nina increasingly builds. She is obsessed with dancing both parts perfectly and fears being replaced.Lily is everything Nina isn't: free spirited and sexual. She is the only dancer not obsessed with perfection and procuring all the lead roles. When Thomas comments on how effortlessly she dances, one can sense Nina's envy. She has practiced for years striving to perfect every step, every move.Thomas never holds back his criticism, even when it brings his dancers to tears. He plays them against each other. He will stop at nothing to get the performance he wants. He even uses sexual advances to get them in to the state of mind he feels is needed.Nina still lives with her mother. She sleeps in the same room she likely slept in as a child. It is still decorated with pink, frilled blankets and stuffed animals. Her relationship with her mother, Erica (played by Barbara Hershey), would make even Oedipus worry. Erica is both overly familiar and controlling. She was once a dancer herself and is set on fulfilling her dreams through her daughter.Ballet is an art that can be life consuming, physically taxing, and, in Nina's case, mentally detrimental. The more obsessed she gets with dancing perfectly as the black swan, the more she loses her mind. She get's paranoid. She has nightmares and hallucinations and can't differentiate between these and reality. No matter what happens, she is never satisfied. When she thinks she didn't get the lead role, she cries at the rejection. When she wins the role, she still cries because of the pressure. She is insecure, always hiding her nervous habits of biting her nails and scratching.I admire Aronofsky mainly for his reputation. Of his films, all I've seen is The Black Swan and The Fountain. I have yet to watch Pi and Requiem for a Dream, his supposed best work. But, he has impressed me so far. His subject matter is always interesting and unique and he directed The Black Swan expertly. The story parallels aspects of Swan Lake wonderfully. It was skillfully photographed and its effects, especially those involving hallucinations, are quite stunning. And as Nina's mental state deteriorates, he causes the audience to feel just as confused as she is. Was this real? Was that a hallucination? Aronofsky doesn't let on until the very end.The Black Swan's performances are all top notch. Portman handles the difficulties of her role extremely well including doing most of her own dancing. Kunis is an actress I've enjoyed since first seeing her in Forgetting Sarah Marshall (That's right. I've never seen That70s Show). It's nice she is getting more substantial, dramatic roles.I don't think comparisons to The Red Shoes are entirely fair. While they are similarly themed films, they take much different approaches. The Black Swan revels in the darkness that The Red Shoes only hinted at comparatively. However, since I've watched both films so recently, comparisons were inevitable. Had I not seen The Red Shoes, I'm not sure I would have appreciated the dancing in The Black Swan. At the same time it left me expecting more. I suspect I'll gain a greater appreciation for The Black Swan when I watch it again and separate it from my thoughts of The Red Shoes.",8,0,2,15 January 2011
Catch-22," Catch-22
","Catch-22 is a movie I've wanted to watch for quite some time. In fact, I've owned the DVD for years, I found it in the $5.50 bin at Wal-Mart way back when. For one reason or another I've never gotten around to watching it until today. The film is a satire of the absurdity of war, it's commercialization, and of bureaucracy in general. The story, in a nutshell, involves a bombardier who doesn't want to fly anymore missions and desperately tries to get grounded on the grounds of insanity. But, this turns out to be easier said than done.The cast is one of the most eclectic I've ever seen: Alan Arkin, Art Garfunkel, Bob Newhart, Martin Sheen, Jon Voight, Orson Welles, Bob Balaban, and Charles Grodin, to name a few (it's interesting seeing some of them in such early roles). They play characters with quirky names such as: Major Major, Chaplain Tappman, Milo Minderbinder, and General Dreedle, each with their varying degrees of insanity. The Major who is forced to take over as squadron leader (an unwanted job) refuses to let people in his office to see him while he is in. They can be sent in to see him after he's left, however (which barely scratches the surface of a great sequence of dialogue). The Lieutenant who trades much-needed supplies with other countries, including the enemy, believes they can come out of the war rich. The General who doesn't understand why he can't shoot an insubordinate officer. The Captain who has crash-landed into the sea four times but always manages to survive and fly right back out there, which has a great payoff in the end. With everyones' use of insanity to cope with the horrors of war, I couldn't help but to draw comparisons to M*A*S*H, the film more than the TV show.Catch-22 was adapted by Buck Henry from a novel, of the same title, authored by Joseph Heller. The story is, effectively, told in a non linear fashion and with recurring flashbacks. As with other satires, many of the situations in the film are absurd, some brilliantly so. And I loved the 'who's on first' nature of the dialogue, going in circles, never quite reaching a logical conclusion. However, I'm interested in reading the book sometime. A couple of the characters felt underused in the screenplay, especially Newhart as Major Major and Welles as General Dreedle.It's director is Mike Nichols, who also did the classic film The Graduate. Though not his best work, it's certainly not his worst either. He opens the film with a beautiful sunrise slowly coming up over a mountainous horizon. All we hear initially is the occasional dog barking or bird chirping. Then, the sound of jet engines roaring. Much of the films opening dialogue is all but drowned out by these sounds of planes starting, taking off, landing, even crashing but the characters carry on, unphased, as if nothing is happening. Nichols' portrayal of humor and violence, often simultaneously, is quite jarring.Though not quite as good as I was hoping, some of the hilariously insane situations and ingenious dialogue make it well worth a watch...Check out my other reviews at: notexactlyaquote.tumblr.com",7,1,3,7 January 2011
It's a Wonderful Life," It's a Wonderful Life
","I don't know how many times I've see It's a Wonderful Life over the years. But after seeing a clip from it in The Ref a couple weeks ago and after hearing references to it in various findings on the internet, I got a hankering to watch it again over the holiday season (I was a day late for Christmas, but close enough). This was the first time I'd watched it in years, and I was amazed how much more you pick up in such a familiar film when you're older.I was surprised by the overt sexual overtones in at least two scenes between George and Mary that I was to young to recognize in years past. And, while this was more of a reminder than a realization, the depth of darkness this film reaches is quite shocking, especially for its time. And yet there was always a shimmer of light in that darkness. I was struck by the scene (major spoilers if any of you haven't seen this classic film) when George is contemplating suicide. Even at his darkest hour, at the lowest point in his life, when he sees Clarence jump in, he doesn't give a second thought to go in after him and save him. What a testament to the ultimate goodness of man.Not only is It's a Wonderful Life a classic holiday film, but it's also an all around great movie for anytime. It is a wonderful story filled with many great characters. It contains many thought-provoking themes on how we effect the lives of others, even if we don't realize it, and what would happen if these effects were taken away or changed.On a side note, I was extremely disappointed to see that the DVD release of this film includes a colorized edition. It's sad that in this day and age we feel like we have to change things to make them more appealing rather than appreciating it the way it was intended, for it's original artistry.
