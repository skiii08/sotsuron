Men in Black 3," Really entertaining!
","I was young when the first Men in black hit the big screen, and I loved it. It was fast, funny, action-filled, lots of cool stuff, good CGI, it took me, and the world, by storm!Then some years later the second one came, and it was kind of a disappointment. The ending was crappy. And the series died.. For a while. But then! Men in Black 3! Suddenly!And you know, I was really entertained through out the whole thing, pretty much. I love that both Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones reprise their roles, and Josh Brolin is an excellent addition. I guess it has to be said that when a movie has time travel, I'm pretty much sold. At least it really helps. I just love time travel. Love it.But the action in this is really good. Will Smith is just the right amount of Will Smith. It's very nicely paced, not too long, I just think they did it right with this one.It does not reinvent the wheel or gun powder, but no movie ever does, and when people think movies do, they don't really. And it doesn't matter if we've seen stuff before, as long as it is done well. And this is just entertaining.I know I totally overuse the word entertaining in my reviews, but hey, entertainment is what I am looking for in a movie. In my opinion if a movie is entertaining, it is good. I'll give it a good rating.Men In Black 3 has that feeling of a late nineties movie.",8,0,2,5 June 2015
John Wick," Pure action perfection
","I watch a lot of action and a lot of horror movies. The more you watch of a certain genre, the more picky you get. Well at least me. Most movies are just OK. That's the sad truth. Most movies are neither horrible nor excellent.Then along comes John Wick, pretty much from the first second I just liked it. The atmosphere is great. Keany Reeves is great. It's crisp, it doesn't waste your time. Normally a movie might start real good, then dip down. Or a movie starts badly, then gets better. John Wick starts excellent, and it just doesn't let up. Every scene is good. I love animals. (I don't even eat them! :P ) And if you love animals, this movie is such a treat. Man oh man. I have been waiting for a movie like this, for I don't know how long.This movie has more head shots than the combined history of Call of Duty. OK, maybe not that many, but a crap-load for sure.It is violent. The action direction is superb. But one of the best things about it, which makes it so damn efficient, is that the build-up is so darn awesome. They do all the right things to get you to understand what kind of ultra bad-ass John Wick is. It is so expertly done, by the actors, the reactions, the direction.I've seen naysayers complain about the lack of 'originality' or whatever in John Wick, and I'm just sick to freaking death of hearing that. If you want originality, do something else than watch movies, because originality has nothing to do with whether a movie is great or not. If the movie is well made and entertaining, it is good. And John Wick is just about as well made and entertaining as action movies get.Watch it, and if you don't like it, you're to blame, not John Wick.",10,2,6,6 June 2015
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Yawn. Pretty much sums it up. Nothing special at all.
","Sorry Star Wars fans, you're probably gonna hate this review. But you'll all admit in a couple of years, that this was one of the worst Star Wars movies. You just need time, I get it.OK, so I'm no big Star Wars fan. But I did enjoy The Force Awakens. And as this is a huge movie with a big budget, big stuff, I was positive. I'm almost always positive when it comes to movies. And with all the stuff that is Star Wars, it kind of has to be at least pretty good, right? Well I thought so, but wrong. This movie commits the greatest sin a movie can: it's boring. It's just downright boring and dull. The main characters, the guy and the girl, have no chemistry, super dull and not even charming in the slightest. Especially the guy, he's like anti-charming. To spare you the boring details, let me just say this, it was two characters I liked, one of them is Donnie Yen. But guess what, he criminally underused! He has like one fight scene, and that's it. He is such a cool character, what a damn shame. The other character I liked is that new robot. He's entertaining.But yeah, this movie is just boring. Sure, for the ultra fans I guess there's a bunch of easter-eggs and connections, but for me, it was just dull. Even the huge action scenes really fail to entertain.Alright alright alright, yes, there is a scene with a VERY famous character, and yes it's awesome. But every scene should be at least a little like that one. You can't have ONE awesome scene in a movie. I also liked the CGI-dude. It's ballsy to try something like that, and they almost pulled it off.So, not saying the movie sucked, it was just really meh. It's visually alright, and has good parts, but all in all boring. Shame.",5,21,37,29 July 2017
Star Trek Into Darkness," Just what it is supposed to be: Entertaining Sci-fi.
","Whoah, is my review gonna drown in the over thousand other reviews? I think so-o!Anyways. I am no Star Trek fan, nor am I a Star Wars fan, and maybe that makes it a bit easier with this one. Because I really liked it. I liked the first one, and I liked this. It is just so well made and so entertaining. It's crisp, looks pretty, actors do a good job. You know, it's just a good movie.Eye candy all around, and lens flares up the wazoo! Which I don't mind, by the way.This was the first time I really noticed Mr. Cumberbatch too. I had heard his name, and probably seen him too, but I wasn't aware of him before this. He is pretty cool, I have to say. He looks super strange (that's just how he looks), and that really fits in this role.Star Trek Into Darkness has plenty of cool action scenes, the story works very well and pulled me in. Like I mentioned, I am initially no big fan of Star Trek, so this is very objective. Well, when it comes to the old Star Trek vs the new, vs Generations and all that stuff. I am not really especially a fan of Sci-fi in general, but I swallowed up this some'thin real good.Both the new Star Trek movies are entertaining fun, I think.",8,3,6,12 June 2015
Us," Just because you want it to be good, doesn't make it good.
","Jordan Peele is at it again!Hard to say too much about this one without spoiling, but here goes.
The acting is good, especially considering many of the actors plays two roles. They all do a bang up job in that regard. So no trouble so far.
The movie looks good. I have no complains here either. It's technically very well made. We always see what's going on, no shaky cam or anything like that. Some nice shots too.
The humor works pretty well, the dialogue comes off as natural.
I like the beginning of the movie, the family is pretty likable.
The movie is sort of a mystery, and when the mystery unravels is when we get to some slight problems. The scrips seems to be based on a pretty good idea, that was never thoroughly worked out. It just isn't thought all the way through.
I am left with several questions, and not in a good way.
This is spoiler terriroty, so I won't go into detail, but it didn't sit well with me. Doesn't seem to make sense. The plot has more holes than a swizz cheese. (that almost no critics talk about this is very strange)Now, in the movies defence, the sub-genre it turne out to be is very far from my favorite, so others might like it better. I've seen a lot of horror movies, and this is just not one of the best ones. It is mediocre.
Not a weak movie, but definitely no classic. Will not be watching it again.",6,530,832,21 March 2019
Crash," Overrated, overdone, forced, at times almost like a parody.
","Alright, I get it. I get what this is supposed to be. Here is the problem, at times it feel like a parody, or a totally unfunny comedy.The first part of Crash is pretty damn stupid. It is just so incredibly overdone! Oh my god. It just gets dumb. Everyone is a unlikable racist. And it's been a while since I saw a movie with this many, this annoying characters. Like 95% of them, I just wish they'd die. And everyone is a complete asshole.Crash only has one really good scene. But I have to admit though, that a couple of the not-so-good scenes did get to me a little. There's some emotional stuff here, and some of it works. A lot doesn't, but some works.Some of the dialog is just plain idiotic. It is so forced, nobody would react like these people do. Most of the major plot points could super easily have been avoided if the characters had talked to each other like normal people, and not in the stupid drama-movie-way that they do.I went into this expecting a solid drama, but once again I am disappointed by a so called 'good' movie. It's just not very good.I won't give this a super bad score, because it has it's moments, and it is well made, and it did entertain me, it's just not great. At all.",6,2,4,21 June 2015
American Sniper," Politics aside - Very good movie
","Let me first say it: I hate war. I think war is a sick, sick concept. It's a legal way to kill people. That is what war is. It's absurd. Chris Kyle was a stone cold killer, just like any serial killer. That's my opinion on that. (man will this review get a lot of dislikes from war vets and gun nuts)Anyway, the movie! I really liked this movie. It's tense, entertaining, and just well made. The story is fascinating, the pacing is good, it barely drags on just a tiny bit towards the end, but just barely. Not enough to have a negative impact.I don't think this movie glorifies war or the US, it shows the grimness of war quite well. Also it tackles how people get disturbed in the head from killing, in a good way.And Bradley Cooper, oh my. He is just excellent! He isn't Bradley Cooper, he is another person! (I would say he's Chris Kyle, but I don't know how he was) Cooper does a fantastic job. And I'm not talking about the weight gain, which anyone could do, I'm talking about his acting chops. I actually felt like I got to know a person, as I saw the movie.So, great movie. Not a fan of war, at all, but a great movie is a great movie.",9,19,34,1 June 2015
Gone Baby Gone," Not that great..
","I really liked Argo, I almost loved The Town. And then I saw Gone Baby Gone, and uuhm, I thought it was a little boring.I was waiting for this movie to pull me in, to satisfy that sweet spot in my brain that some movies hit. When they hit, it makes me happy. It keeps me entertained, and for a little while life seems worth living. But, Gone Baby Gone never got there. Yes, the acting is good. Technically, camera work, lighting, all that, the movie is great. But it just is not that interesting. Well, not for me. I didn't really care much what happened. It just never sucked me in, dammit. That really annoys me, because it is kind of the sole purpose of a movie like this.Therefore, Gone Baby Gone is not that great. It didn't stick with me at all, I will never watch it again. The Town though, that's a much better fare.",6,1,2,13 June 2015
American Hustle," One word: Disappointing.
","I was looking forward to this. All that critical praise, dem actors!I must admit, I didn't quite get what this movie was supposed to be. It has some comedic elements, some crime elements, and a lot of.. drama, I guess.I thought I was getting a clever heist-movie or something, and it kind of is, but the payoff comes so late, and it's not very satisfying.The acting is top notch, pretty much all over, but that's not enough. Plus, some, well at least one of the characters is really annoying.I'm a guy, so yeah, I couldn't help but notice the female eye candy. Neither Jennifer Lawrence or Amy Adams are ugly, that's for sure. As for the ladies, not that much eye candy for you in this one, I'm afraid. But human eye candy does not a great film make, so I'd say this is way overrated.Might be one of those movies you should see twice to appreciate. Or maybe know exactly what you're getting, before you watch it. But I doubt I will see it again, so I might never find out.",5,3,4,2 July 2015
Baby Driver," It was OK. But I'm a little disappointed (prob bcs of hype)
","Once again, expectations ruins the party. It's impossible not to expect great things when a movie gets such praise as this one got. And I gotta say, I'm a little disappointed.It's not bad, it doesn't suck. It has qualities, no doubt. It's an alright movie, but that's it for me. Alright.The first half hour or so, was kind of boring to me. Some cool details sprinkled here and there, but nothing more. Then something clicks and the movie steps it up a little. But still it's like.. overall it's just OK. The characters are OK, sadly not half as cool as they (try hard) are supposed to be. Some of them are slightly annoying, but nothing that ruins the movie or anything. The action is pretty good and well edited, I maybe thought the shootouts were a little too hectic though. But the driving is solid, but not out of this world.The music I found to be tiring. Yes, it's there for a reason, but it's just too much. And the love story? Gtfo. Love story? Like really? That did suck.To sum up. If I hadn't known anything, I would probably have liked it better, but I did know something, so here we are. Score. I'll probably rate it a 7, even though I am tempted to give it a 6, but I think that's too low. Somewhere between 6 and 7, then. If I see it again, maybe I'll bump it up, who knows. Weak 7 for now.",7,3,6,5 August 2017
Man of Steel," Such a disappointment, poor action build up
","What the heck happened!? Zack Snyder, director of 300, Watchmen, Suckerpunch, movies containing some of the very best, most awesome over the top action scenes the world has ever seen..? And then he makes a Superman movie, and it is totally not awesome? It must be studio interference that screwed this up, because I really want Zack Snyder to have more awesome action up his sleeve.You can say a lot about Man of Steel, but here is my main beef. The action is not very good. We get a lot of destruction, humanoids being tossed around, thrown through buildings and such, but why is it not awesome? One reason I think, is that it is just too.. hard. Too violent. Not too violent as in in too much violence, but it's like, they barely touch each other and then they just fly through the air 1000000000 miles per hour.. You get no sense of their power, although that's what you're supposed to, because it's just so overdone. For that to work, you must build it up. You don't start with the biggest action scene. You wouldn't start with superman hitting someone making them fly through a thousand buildings. First we get a little taste, then a little bigger taste, and so on.In all the fights it's the same. Somebody pushes or hits someone and they fly away so incredibly fast that you get no sense of anything. A real shame. The effects are very good though, this could have been awesome. But it's not.I know the movie is just made to clear the way for Batman v Superman, but still. And why are there not lots of slo-mo? Come on, it Superman for crying out loud. Even the last Superman-movie had that awesome bullet-to-the eye-scene. Here we get nothing? At least I can't remember any.Also it is totally devoid of humor, badly paced, just not very entertaining. Well made, yes. Good movie? No.",5,3,6,12 June 2015
Kung Fu Panda 2," Huge disappointment. Crap fighting. No good.
","I really liked the first Kung Fu Panda-movie. I was really looking forward to this, but what the hell happened!? This sucks!The first one was funny, entertaining, at times heartwarming, pretty awesome.Then we get this? Nothing is right in this one. The fighting scenes are total crap. Sloppy and boring. The action direction is awful. The movie has no real heart. It's not funny at all. But most of all, the fighting is crap! I need to stress this, because the fighting in a movie about fighting, needs to be good. And how in the name of all that is holy can you mess up the fighting in an animated movie? And the next movie in the series even has the same director! (together with another director according to IMDb, but still)No, this was a huge disappointment. How this movie has the high score it has, is beyond me. Jeremy Jahns even liked it! What!",3,1,5,19 June 2015
"I, Robot"," So. Easily. Watchable. Very entertaining.
","I don't have a lot to say about this movie, all I really want to say is this:I, Robot is one of those movie that if I catch it on TV, no matter at what point in the movie, I will watch it to it's end.It is just so easily watchable. I don't know if English speaking people understand what I mean by that, but what I mean is that is doesn't require anything from the viewer. It visually interesting, got lots of eye candy, it's cut in a way that keeps it from being boring, it's well paced - and so on and so on. It is just very 'easily watchable'.It's action, very enjoyable action sequences, it's the future, technology. It's just really, really entertaining. Well made.",8,0,1,14 June 2015
Wanted," This is art. Action art.
","When I saw the trailer for this movie, I got psyched. Stoked. Excited. It looked really cool. I happen to love bullet-time, and the trailer shows bullet-time. But, what I had experienced on several different occasions is that the trailer shows all the cool stuff, and then in the movie there is nothing new. Wanted is not like that. There are tons of awesome scenes, bullet-time, slo-mo. Lots! Yes, you can pick this movie apart for several reasons I'm sure, plot holes, 'unrealism', blah-blah-blah, but the bottom line should be: is it entertaining? Let me answer: Yes.There are so many awesome scenes in this movie, it is just incredible. Head shots, super slo-mo, blood, violence, action! I just love it.I have some minor gripes here and there, but the coolness just flat out outweighs it.Wanted is visual candy violence, and if you love bullet-time like me, you will probably love this.This is a perfect example of extreme action. We don't get many as good at this! If this movie and John Wick had a baby, it would just explode.",10,0,2,13 June 2015
Divergent," Uninteresting.. Rating on IMDb is way too high.
","I went into this hoping for some simple entertainment. I liked The Hunger Games movies quite well, they are just well made and entertaining. This is not.First of all, there are too many dumb things with the story and the universe, this is set in. When you think, while you watch the movie, 'hey, that's dumb', when you don't even have to be made aware of it after the movie, but think it during.. Needless to say, that's not a good thing. (and I can usually suspend my disbelief)Also it gets way to obvious that is was made only because The Hunger Games was such a success. Same thing with The Maze Runner. It's not the worst movie ever, but it's annoying, and that's not good at all. Shailene Woodley does an alright job, she's a good actress, and has an intriguing appearance. That tall dude, his appearance I don't care for. And yes, how people look matters in movies. I want to see pretty people in movies. But anyway! Divergent is just not very good.",4,0,0,5 June 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Overall pretty good, but had a couple of minor problems.
","I was actually slightly, although just slightly, disappointed with this one. Probably because of the hype, mostly. I liked the last one, Ghost Protocol, much better. Lemme break it down f'yall!My first problem, bad fighting choreography. Not that it is that much fighting, but the fighting that is, is a little too shaky and you don't see clearly enough what is actually happening. I hate that. It totally ruins fighting. I tried to see on the cast and crew-list who the fighting choreographer was, but couldn't find any, for shame director, for shame! If you have fighting in a movie, you need a choreographer. My next minor problem was that I thought some of the more exciting scenes, were a little clumsily directed. Maybe it's just me, but I felt i lacked that last.. uhm, whatever, to make it really exciting. A little anti-climatic.With that said, there is some awesome action in this movie, no doubt! The actors are all likable. Production value is sky high. Sound design was excellent. All effects were great. Big props to that crazy old Tom Cruise, for doing his own stunts. Maybe I'll crank my score up a star if I see it again and like it better, we'll see.I would also like to see a little more extreme action, I like that kind of thing. You know, the hero landing a bike on a car in mid air, while shooting two guns at 10 bad-guys, then jumping off onto a boat as the car explodes. The action in Rogue Nation is more 'down to earth'. Still pretty extreme, but could be more extreme. Funny thing, saw it at the theater in Oslo, with my girlfriend. The people next to us, who we though were undercover cops at first, turned out to be 'agents' because the Crown Prince of Norway just happened to be at the theater, same times as us! Hah! And there is even a 'I'm the king of Norway'joke in the movie. Sitting next to a real undercover agent, while seeing a movie about agents. Now that's meta!",7,0,3,15 September 2015
Inside Out," Fun, entertaining and mostly really smart.
","Caught an early screening of this at Cinemateket, Oslo. Nice! Because it premieres here in late August. Wah-wah.Having seen several good reviews and scores, I went into this expecting something pretty great. Albeit, I also heard great things about Up and Toy Story 3, which I found to be overrated, but in this case, what was said, was mostly true.This movie has a lot of really smart writing. The main idea is really good, and all the small details are super fun, the story in general, as in plot is nothing too special, but it works.But as I said, what really makes this stand out is the smartness of a lot of the jokes and ideas. The big jokes, main jokes, if you will, I didn't find all that funny, but the small details, those made me chuckle. A chuckle that both said: that's pretty funny, and wow that's really smart.Funny thing, a couple of times during the movie I thought to myself, 'ah, so that's how my brain works'. Haha, then followed by, 'no wait, we know emotions aren't tiny creatures living in our brains'.. right? My point being, it's really plausible and well made.The animation is of course superb, didn't expect anything less. The voice cast is also top notch. I did find a couple of things with the script to be a little lazy, actually, and really felt it took the movie down a notch. I was rather surprised at some parts, well one in particular, giving the fact that most of the movie is so smart.I had heard that it was supposed to be very sad, or touching in some parts, but it didn't really get to me as much as I'd hoped.(not trying to be tough here, I love being touched and sad by movies)All in all this is a well made, entertaining, smartly written (for the most part) movie with heart. Well done.How soon will the sequel be announced? and spin-off? This could potentially be a huge franchise.",8,12,37,30 June 2015
Twilight," I didn't hate it.
","I'm gonna go right out and say it, I didn't hate this! I kind of enjoyed it. It was more good than bad. It was alright, but after this one it went so fast down hill that the whole carriage crashed and burned.I don't have that much to say about it, really. I can say that most of the 'action'scenes are pretty bad. The scene where Bella sits on his back, and he runs around, ouch, that's just painfully bad. It looks totally stupid. It's like.. So silly looking. I don't hate Kristen Stewart either. Yeah, she is kind of annoying, but more than that I think she's quite cute, and not that bad an actress. And she isn't stupid either, I think. And she used to not wear high heels, and I am a sucker for that. But enough!This is the Twilight that is fully watchable, the second one is horrible, and I haven't seen any more. I just said: that's enough of that!",6,1,3,2 June 2015
Non-Stop," We have a very enjoyable thriller over here!
","Non-Stop is a very pleasurable action thriller.Another one of those movies that I just liked immediately after it began. Some movies are like that, some, very few movies.As long as you don't expect another Taken, (this is thriller-material) you will probably have a very good time. Sure, there are some plot holes, I did not notice any during the movie, but have had them pointed out, but we (well you) should all stop focusing so damn much on plot holes. As long and they are not right in your face, and/or really poorly explained away, they don't matter.Liam Neeson is good, as he always is. the movie is kind of tense, and pretty exciting. I love plane-movies, planes look so nice and cozy in movies. Relaxed me.So there you have it! I don't need to say more. Non-Stop is a well made, entertaining, action-thriller.",8,1,2,12 June 2015
How to Train Your Dragon 2," My high expectations were shot down, or should I say ...burned down? *wink*
","This is one of the very few times that I don't agree with Jeremy Jahns. He was crazy about this, but I did not get blown away at all.I really liked the first HTTYD, I had some gripes with it, I thought it was different than it actually was, and thus was very pleasantly surprised when I found out I was wrong, and that I liked it. But there is just something missing from the sequel. Actually, I don't really remember that much, it is very forgettable.I can't really say what I didn't like, there was just something missing. It didn't pull me in, and I was almost kind of bored at times. It is not a bad movie, but it is really not a great one either. It is mediocre, and that is a movie sin!Of course the animation is spotless, and the action is alright, the dragon is cute, and so on and on, but there is something missing.",6,2,6,12 June 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," The overrating is strong in this one
","Don't get me wrong, this is a funny-ish, quirky, alright little movie. But it is just that. Alright.How many Oscar nominations did it get? About a billion. While I watched it, never, not for a second, did Oscar come to mind. Although, the Oscars is but a bleak shadow of what it used to be. Moving on. (I did not know about the nominations when I saw it, just for the record)This movie is quirky. Kind of strange, got some humor of the Wes Anderson-type, it's got a lot of strange characters, and an OK plot. But never is it really fantastic. I think people just expect Wes Anderson to be brilliant, and so they think everything he does is.As I said, it's mostly entertaining. But it never becomes much more than OK. It has a lot of actors, pretty big names, which is part of the reason why I wanted to see it. But to be honest I expected more from the movie it self. Yeah, it's visually interesting, but everyone already knows that.",6,11,20,5 June 2015
It Follows," All hype aside, a creepy little thing
","It Follows! The long awaited sequel to Stephen Kings It! I couldn't say I recognized much from the original IT, but hey.. What do I know? KIDDING! Hah, I am a funny guy.It follows! I am a little confused here. Did I like this because it was really good, or did I like it because I know it has gotten real good reviews?I don't usually buy into hype, because I've many times experienced that movies 'everybody' loves, ain't always that good. Therefore I think It follows is pretty good.But let's just get right into it. It Follows has some genuinely creepy scenes. Really creepy. I actually got goosebumps at one time. And I don't goosebump easily from horror.Personally I could have taken a couple more creepy scenes, but maybe they work better since they are not that many. Apart from the creepiness of some scenes, the atmosphere in the movie in general kind of weighs down on you. There's some good use of sound effects and music here. It's unsettling and dark, and you kind of wonder if there is something the movie isn't telling you. The acting is really good. I don't think we've seen the last of Maika Monroe! She works very well because even though she is pretty and hot, she looks like a normal teenager. (she doesn't wear tons of make up, always having perfect hair and being unhealthily skinny) I really liked that. So, try to forget the hype (hype always ruins) and watch It Follows for a somewhat different and creepy little flick.",8,39,78,7 June 2015
Insidious," Fantastic horror. Just straight up done right.
","Let me tell you a story. A story about a couple dudes who love their horror. Me and my brother had this thing for several years, where we watched a horror movie almost every night. Some nights even two! We loved 'ghost movies' maybe the most. So we were always on the look-out for those. Then one night we got a hold of this one, Insidious. We hadn't heard of it, but we gave it a whirl. As I said, we watched a lot, and a lot of what we watched was pretty bad. But his one, oh, it just blew us away.There are plenty of reviews on this one, so I won't go into too much detail. But the thing with Insidious, is not that it's a revolutionary movie you've never seen the likes of before. It is that it does what it tries to do, so very, very good. The stuff that happens is just cool, and creepy. (The scene with the record player and the creepy song, in particular) It just has these small details that not everyone gets. And these details are what makes this a horror classic.In a haunted house movie, a very important part is what kind of creepy stuff happens. Not everyone understands this. A common mistake is to pace it wrong. In Insidious it is very well paced, and the incidents that happen are really cool. And it is genuinely scary. Scary movies never really scare me, but this one gets pretty close.Insidious goes to show that there are still excellent horror movies to be made. And that on a budget of one million dollars? James Wan, you know your damn stuff!",9,0,0,1 June 2015
Frozen," Froverrated!
","I love animation. I like almost all computer animated movies I see. (Some of the low budget ones are a drag, though)But Frozen is not low budget. It has sky high production values. But still, I was really, really disappointed by it. Which I hate. I hate being disappointed by movies. I love movies, and I want to like them all!Frozen is, well, it's just not that good. No one thing in particular can be pointed out. They have two of everything basically, maybe that's what makes it a little strange. I don't know.Parts of the plot make absolutely no sense at all, this is not something I'm normally bothered by, but here I was.I can not understand why everyone is so crazy about this movie. There are so many really good animation movies, this is sadly not one of them. It does not excel at anything. And a couple of the songs are horrible. Oh my god. We have many great animated movies, from the classics like Toy Story, to the newer ones like Cloudy.. Brave, and so one. Watch those instead.",5,4,12,5 June 2015
2001: A Space Odyssey," A technically good snooze fest
","Don't believe the hype. This movie is dated and for the most part, very boring. I mean like, really, really boring. Yes, the visuals are great for their time, and there are cool elements here, but it is way to long, and very little actually happens.I can enjoy old movies, I mostly like newer movies, but there are lots of good old movies too. And I can appreciate visual art, I am a visual artist with a visual brain, so it's not like I am a simpleton who only likes action movies. I like all kinds of movies, if they are entertaining. This is just not, except some parts here and there.People get very mad when someone criticizes this movie, because everyone thinks it's supposed to be this fantastic classic, and maybe it is, but it is a boring classic. But don't rate this super high just because everyone else does.On a couple of occasions it's interesting, for a minute or so, then it's straight back to snooze mode. Old movies are not always good just because they were good back in the day. It racked up some stars from me, because I really liked some of the acting from the main character, and of course the special effects who are incredible considering they are soon to be 50 years old (oh my!), and a couple of things I won't mention any further to not spoil, but all in all I was not entertained by this. Rather watch The Shining again.",5,5,12,18 December 2014
Drag Me to Hell," Super fun and entertaining
","Let me start by saying: We get way too few movies like this!This is a thoroughly entertaining horror movie with some good scares, and lots of cool stuff. It didn't scare me, exactly, but it has lots of scary imagery. Cool, scary stuff, in short.It is just fun. It's got a nice budget, is really well made, and fun. It doesn't take it self that seriously, it's got some humor to loosen it up.I'm not going to go on and on about this, but if you want a crisp, new, fun horror flick, look no further. Good effects, solid build-up, a couple jump-scares, some scary images, just horror entertainment, OK?Fun fact; this was the first movie I saw with my (now) girlfriend. Good times. And then it turns out she hates horror..! Do'h!",8,0,0,16 June 2015
La La Land," Directing good, plot and characters flat, like really boring people.
","What's the big deal with La La Land!? I don't know! Narsissistic Hollywood nominating it for 16 billions Oscars, I sort of get that. La La Land is all about the good old (boring) times. But what about all the other critics? Why do they love it so much? Strange. Could it be that no one dares to say they thought it was kind of meh? Possibly.OK. So La La Land is well directed. It's well made. Everything is nice and OK. Technically it's pretty good. But that's it. The songs are really nothing special. The acting is nothing special. The dancing is nothing special. The story? Nothing special. Not much at all, really. See where I'm going with this? La La Land is nothing special. It has nothing new. I don't really mind it not having anything new, but other critics always seem to, so why don't they think it matters with La La Land? And no, it's not one of those times where the direction is so good that we don't need a story. Not at all.These characters are so flat and boring. Oh my god. Emma Stones character wants to be an actress. Ryan Goslings character is a jazz pianist. That's it. They have absolutely NO other qualities. They are the most boring people I've seen in a movie for quite some time. And it's nothing more to say about them. They are snore.And the piano theme they beat us over the head with? Yes yes, it's nostalgic and nice, but come on! Over and over and over. And over and over and over and over.I think in a couple of years people will have forgotten why they supposedly loved this movie so much, and it will more or less get lost in history. It's hype, people. A lot of hype. It's not bad, but 14 Oscarnom worthy? Hell no!",5,6,11,23 February 2017
Sinister," Sinister is a dish best described creepy.
","Without spoiling I can say that this movie surprised me, because I thought I knew how it was going to be, but it wasn't that way. I love being wrong in those cases. Anyway, this is a creepy ass movie!Damn! I watched it alone, at night, as I do with pretty much all movies I watch, at least horror. And you know what? A couple of times I looked behind my back, just to check I was alone. That's not something I often do. The atmosphere is very creepy in this little flick. There are some sound effects that can really chill ya! Chilled me, anyway.Without giving high hopes I can say it is one of the very, very few horror movies that kind of scared me a little. Which I just love. And it impresses me, because movie wise I do not scare easily. (Not saying that to sound cool and tough, although I am those things)Ethan Hawke does a great job, some of his reaction shots are excellent, and really ups the scary. You can read some trivia on that here on IMDb, after you have watched this little gem.I liked this one very much, it's up there with Insidious, and a couple of others. This blessed new wave of creepy, well made horror movies. Huzzah!",8,1,3,2 June 2015
Reservoir Dogs," Overrated. It's OK, relatively entertaining, but never is it great.
","Maybe I was expecting a little too much here, but dammit if this wasn't one of the most disappointing movie experiences I've ever had.Although Quentin Tarantino has done some cool stuff, I think he is one of the most overrated directors out there.Yes, there are some cool scenes in Reservoir Dogs, but you know, the feeling I was left with after the credits rolled was: was that it? I was waiting for all this awesomeness to come, but I didn't see much of it. Their names are maybe the coolest thing in the whole movie.It looks good considering the low budget and being Tarantino's debut, but mostly it's just OK. And that god damn 'Tarantino-dialogue' that everyone can't stop yapping about, what is so great about it? I find it more annoying than anything else.Btw, just to make it clear: I love violence, I don't mind movies that lack plot, and I don't mind style over substance. What I do mind is boring movies.Maybe if I didn't know anything about this before I saw it, or didn't know what I was seeing, whatever, I would have enjoyed it more, but that wasn't the case. It is what it is, man!",5,0,0,9 July 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," I'm no Scorsese fan-boy, but this is just excellent
","Like I said, I am not a Scorsese-fan, really. Yes, he has made some good movies, but not all his work is worthy of all the praise it receives. But The Wolf of Wall Street, now that is just one hell of an entertaining roller-coaster ride. Roller-coaster ride is such a cliché expression, but this movie is exactly that.It pretty much starts at 90mph, and rarely lets up. There is cynicism, money, drugs, sex and lots of swearing. Leonardo Dicaprio is absolutely fantastic, and I don't even need to mention a certain Quaalude-related scene..? Awesome. The other roles are really good too, Jonah Hill is great.This is possibly the longest, entertaining movie I have ever seen. It's about three hours long, and still it's not really too long.That it's based on a true story of course sweetens the deal, as some of the stuff that happens is pretty wild. I also kind of like the mystery of not knowing what is true or not. (Some of it simply can't be true..right?)There is something about these kinds of success stories that I find incredibly entertaining.Everything is probably already said about this movie, so I shall say no more! It's awesome.",9,0,5,12 June 2015
Dark Shadows," Entertaining enough, but a little too uneven
","Even though I kind of like Dark Shadows, it is a shame it does not follow up on a rather awesome scene quite early in the movie. What I'm referring to is a rather violent scene, I won't go into detail because spoilers, but let's just say it's pretty cool. It really looks like Tim Burtons way of portraying some vampire-related violence.Unfortunately though, the scene I'm talking about does not represent much of the rest of the movie.I do think this movie is the kind of movie that sort of grows on you. The first time I saw it I had some expectations, they were not really met. But then I caught parts of it on television later, and I found it more entertaining. Dark Shadows is a little bit more of the old Tim Burton we know and love, not so much the new one. Yes, it has Johnny Depp, but still I find it to be more Batman/Scissorhands and less Alice in Wonderland. It is a little on the long side, I would have liked if it were a little darker, some more vampire violence, but hey, what are ya gonna do!? It is uneven, and that is much of the reason why I didn't like it better. I hope Mr. Burton continues in this track, rather than the track he has been on the last 10-ish years.Johnny Depp is alright in this, but Tim Burton, you have got to stop having him in everything you make.",6,0,0,13 June 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," As a drama-thriller, this is quite nice.
","Let's face it, this is a drama-thriller. It has like, two or three action sequences, and they are not really that memorable either. And Batman.. Come on, Christopher Nolans Batman is not Batman. It is supposed to be realistic, (which it is not at all) and if you're going for realism, do not make a movie about a nut-case who dresses up like a bat.But I do not think of Nolans Dark Knight-trilogy as Batman, I just think of them as movies. And when you do, they are good. (Tim Burtons Batman-movies are the real Batman-movies BTW)But with that said, this is a well made, entertaining drama-thriller, with a couple action-scenes.But as a Batman movie this is total crap. (All three are, actually) But when it comes to movies, I give the benefit of the doubt, and I want to be entertained, so I give this a score based on the premise that it is just a movie that kind of reminds of Batman. It had me entertained.",8,2,5,1 June 2015
Casino," Not horrible, but a little overrated
","It's pretty entertaining and all you know, well made, good acting, all that. But after seeing it, I'm still thinking.. It's not really that great. One thing is that it's too long. It's fun to see the empire growing, and there is a lot happening, but it is still just too damn long.I am no big fan of mafia-movies, really, but I had this mafia craze a little while back and I saw The Sopranos, and all the biggest mob-movies, but still I was a little meh about this one. The reason for the high rating is that it's Scorsese, and that it's mafia. Those two combined often equals overrating. It's not bad, that's not what I'm saying, but it's not a perfect movie. I want to be more entertained, and more sucked in by a movie like this, Casino didn't quite do it. I can't say exactly what it was, maybe it was just my expectations being too high.Maybe I'll see it again some time, and then like it better.",6,1,3,5 June 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Slightly overrated, but entertaining enough
","Wow, it's the same thing almost every time - when a movie receives extreme praise from both audiences and critics, it is wise to be a little skeptical, because it's probably not that good. And while this is a pretty entertaining movie, it's nothing too special.I wanted to like it, I always want to like movies, but I'm giving my honest opinion here.It does have some really cool elements though, and some nice cinematography, some awesome shots. But I found it to be rather uneven. We have long action sequences, that are not really that exciting, to be honest. It got a little dull. It's basically the same thing for 2 hours. But spread evenly around are small things, details, that bumps it into awesome-territory, then the action bumps it down again.This was how my brain was thinking during the movie. It went from: 'Is this all there is'? To: 'wow, OK, yeah that's pretty cool'. To: 'This is not that entertaining'. To: 'Oh, that is awesome though'. And so on. See? Uneven.And where was all that gore and violence I was promised? We see a bunch of dudes getting run over, but there is so little gore that I felt like this was PG13 most of the time. I don't mind PG13, but when a movie is rated R, I expect more than what we got here. (could it be they were aiming for PG13, but got an R and didn't have time to edit?)It probably doesn't help me much that I don't like this kind of dry, deserty post apocalyptic crap. But considering I don't like it, I did like the movie relatively well. Parts of the main plot I am totally sure I've seen before. I don't want to spoil anything, but right? Haven't we seen exactly this in some cartoon for children or something?The acting was fine, I don't really have much to say. Immortan Joe was pretty cool, Max was a little weird. Charlize I have nothing to say about, but she did fine. Mel Gibson should absolutely have been in it though, he has some real charisma, which this movie is lacking. (I know he's an a- hole, but he's still a good actor)The effects look pretty decent for the most part. I've read that there is a lot of practical effects used here, which people go on and on about, I don't care that much, I just want to see cool stuff. CG or not. There is definitely CG used in Fury Road, too btw. Not all of it is great either, actually.So, all in all. Uneven movie. Some really good parts, other parts are not that good. Some ideas work very well, others no so much. I'm looking at you, air soul heart grab thing. Among other stuff.I think you have to like cars/engines/driving, and SAND to really dig this movie. Plus it helps to be a huge fan of the old ones, I guess.",7,1,5,2 July 2015
Furious 7," Has its flaws, but the action is superb. Over the top, like I like it.
","For the absolutely most part I really enjoyed this action movie. This is exactly the kind of action that I really like. Extreme action. Action that does not try to be 'realistic' at all. Over the top action. (and I really hate people that can't accept extreme action, they be all like: 'yeah, right, that's SO unrealistic'! Dumb people.Here's what I don't like. I have to say I have a slight problem with Vin Diesel. I mean, he's alright, it's just, compared to Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham, he's just, well he kind of pales in comparison. His character is also slightly annoying. With his family-talk all the god damn time. We get it, you're into family, the only thing that matters is family, your little gang is family. Family. Family. And hose gravelly grunts he speaks in, ain't cool bruh. Sometimes you can barely make out what he is saying.The movie also tries to portray him as super strong, which I don't totally buy. He's a big guy, but not that big. He looks like he thinks he's bigger than he is. Compared to the monster that is The Rock, he looks like a skinny twig for Petes sake. And he, Vin Diesel, is lifting cars and tossing people several yards, I just don't buy it.Also there's some other stuff that I didn't like. There's this 'computer chip' with some insane technology, and it seemed a little out of place. That stuff was straight up sci/fi. I hate when they mix sci/fi-stuff into action movies that are set today. The plot has some issues, but I choose not to care too much.OK, got that out of the way. This movies has perfectly shot, exciting, over the top-action. Several big, long action scenes, and I pretty much loved all of them. And since this is an action movie first and foremost, I won't let the negative stuff count all that much. I was very entertained.There are a couple of 'jump-out-of-a-car-in-slow-motion, at-the-last-millisecond, with-a-one-in-a-billion-chance-of-making-it'- scenes that for some reason gives me goosebumps a little. Probably because they are so over the top. I love that stuff. I think of who ever came up with something so over-the-top, and get a little impressed. Good job!Good thinking getting Jason Statham into this, I so rooted for him. He is way cooler than the whole furious-team.And that Nathalie Emmanuel, holy gasoline fumes is she gorgeous. And she speaks nineteen languages, including Dothraki, what a catch!And of course, we all know Paul Walker is no longer with us, and you're reminded of that each time he is on screen. He gets a little montage at the end, it is very well done - really sad, man. Real damn sad.",8,81,95,21 September 2015
