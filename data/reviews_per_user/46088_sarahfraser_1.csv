United 93," amazing
","i was amazed at this film, the beginning is slow but very interesting, i thought the three guys in this film were amazing (dont want to spoil it for the people that have not seen it), they were so brave for what they did, there families should be proud for what they tried to do to save the country, if i was in there shoes i would be I just cannot believe it took the vice president so long to give the military permission to let them, so it was to late to save so many lives I'm appalled.I so recommend people to see this film its so powerful and moving i cried. It goes behind the scenes about the about September 11th and what happened.",10,0,2,8 June 2006
