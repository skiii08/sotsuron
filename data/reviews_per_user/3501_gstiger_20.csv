Raiders of the Lost Ark," Snakes, why did it have to be snakes...
","This is the first of the popular series. A great film but I feel it is the weakest of the trilogy. The action is great but not as good as the prequel's and sequel's action. Steven Spielberg received his second Academy Award nomination for Best Directing, for good reason, he does a phenomenal job. The story is pretty good, incorporating action and a little bit of comedy and drama. Harrison Ford does a good job at acting, as always. The music is terrific, introducing the famous Indiana Jones theme. The special effects are good, especially for this area. All and all a pretty good film.",9,0,1,19 April 2000
Se7en," A truly brilliant film, in its own dark and twisted way.
","This is a film that stays with you long after the credits have finished. It is incredibly dark and twisted. It provides an intriguing passage into the human mind and human behavior. Fincher's direction is good. He chooses dark, wet, and dim locations to spin this grotesque tale of death. The story is good in that it tells it like it is, this is no fairy tale. The performances are, for the most part, pretty good. The best performance is given by Kevin Spacey. Morgan Freeman is terrific as always. Brad Pitt is good but he could be better. This film has the greatest climax I have seen form any motion picture, it is incredibly intense. If you haven't seen this then you simply must, but it is not for the faint hearted.",9,0,0,13 June 2000
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," I told you this place was dangerous...
","This is the third installment in the epic space drama.  It is an excellent film but perhaps the weakest out of the original trilogy.  The story is first rate, bringing even more exotic locations and characters to the Star Wars universe.  After seeing only a brief glimpse of the Emperor in ESB, we are finally, truly introduced to the Dark Jedi Master here.  John Williams' score is excellent, as always.  The final space battle is far more elaborate then the one shown in the original Star Wars.  Do yourself a favor and watch this classic.",8,0,1,3 April 2000
Alien," Alien is sleek and stylish science fiction film.
","Through its magnificent sets, story, and characters, Alien would influence many science fiction films that would follow it; though few would ever equal it. Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett's screenplay is good and very original. The one drawback is the minor subplot involving Ian Holm's character, Ash, which is fairly interesting but I always felt that it bogged the film down.
Overall, the cast is pretty good. Tom Skerritt does a nice job at underplaying his character of Captain Dallas. Sigourney Weaver, Harry Dean Stanton, and Ian Holm also give commendable performances.Ridley Scott's direction is phenomenal. His attention to detail is astounding. He takes full advantage of his sets, music, and lighting to make the film as eerie as possible.Jerry Goldsmith's subtle musical score is great; it is very effective and quite ominous and unnerving. The art direction and set decoration in Alien is absolutely terrific. The sets are large and yet they have a very claustrophobic feel.
The special effects for the alien creature are quite convincing. The full-grown alien is not shown in prolonged shots or whole-body shots. This is a wise decision on the filmmakers' part; had the alien been shown in full body shots it would have given the impression of someone in a suit and so it wouldn't have been as convincing. Alien is a worthy addition to anyone's film library.",10,0,1,31 May 2001
Taxi Driver," Taxi Driver is a great film; one of the best to come out of the 70's.
","I'm not really that much of a Scorsese fan, I saw nothing special or extraordinary in Raging Bull or Goodfellas, but I must say; I found this film to be very good.Paul Schrader's dark and gritty screenplay is exceptional. He effectively creates a sense of loneliness in one of the largest, most highly populated cities in the world. Schrader creates one of the most complex and disturbing film characters in Travis Bickle. Robert DeNiro also lends, significantly, to the character of Travis in one of the greatest cinematic performances ever. He perfectly captures the loneliness, complexity, and frustration of Travis. Jodie Foster gives a commendable performance as a young prostitute on the streets of New York City. Peter Boyle, Cybill Shepherd, and Harvey Keitel all give noteworthy performances. Martin Scorsese uses many intriguing and unique camera angles and shots to tell this shady story; his direction really is quite good.
Bernard Herrmann's romantic and sometimes ominous musical score nicely compliments the images on screen. Michael Chapman's cinematography is also first-rate. His use of lighting combined with Scorsese's unique direction and the occasional utilization of slow motion gives the film a very surreal look.Taxi Driver certainly isn't a film for everyone. It will leave you feeling hollowed out but if you think you can stomach it; I urge you to give it a try.",10,0,0,31 May 2001
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," I swear I will not kill anyone...
","This is the best action/science fiction movie I have ever seen. It is Arnold's and James Cameron's best film. This film is much better then the original Terminator. James Cameron shows us again that he is a master at creating wonderful science fiction and action stories and managing to  bring in several elements of human drama. Some examples of the drama are: Sarah reluctantly excepting the Terminator as a partner and Sarah's struggle with what she knows the future will bring. The Terminator takes on a fartherly figure while Sarah Connor becomes the hunter, the 'terminator.' The acting is pretty good. The music is okay. The special effect are wonderful, especially for the time period in which this was made. Do yourself a favor and watch this classic.",9,1,1,19 April 2000
Aliens," Who's laying these eggs...
","One of the greatest action/science fiction films I have ever seen. I feel this film far surpasses the original. James Cameron is a master at creating a good action film that includes bits of human drama, an example of this is Ripley's bond with Newt. The story is good and filled with suspense and terror. The acting is okay. Sigourney Weaver does a wonderful job at reprising her role as Ellen Ripley. It's no wonder she received an Academy Award nomination for her performance in this film. The music by James Horner is very good and adds to the atmosphere. The special effects are excellent, especially the vicious and life-like Alien Queen. Do yourself a favor and watch this classic.",9,1,2,19 April 2000
Pearl Harbor," Pearl Harbor's technical aspects are astonishing but its plot is lacking.
","Pearl Harbor is a film that tries too hard to make too much money by giving us harrowing battles, Hollywood hunks, and a Hollywood romance. It's real focus should be to honor those who died at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.
Michael Bay's trademark, flashy direction is quite evident here. In many of his shots and sequences it is quite apparent that his borrowing from Titanic and Saving Private Ryan.Randall Wallace's screenplay is overly clich√©d and includes many one-dimensional characters. Many of the lines of dialogue are quite annoying and melodramatic. The performances are merely mediocre. Ben Affleck needed more expression and emotion both in his speech and facial expressions. Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett give average performances, but when they try to be emotional it's painfully clear that their emotions are forced and fake. Cuba Gooding Jr. overplays his character but his screen time is minimum so he's not as annoying as he would be. Jon Voight is very convincing as President Franklin D. Roosevelt and gives the best performance of the film.The pacing is both poor and excellent. The beginning of the film is rather slow. There's simply too much there and it bogs the film down. On the other hand, the editing for the battle scenes is appropriately face-paced and riveting.The CGI work and pyrotechnics of Pearl Harbor are first-rate. The sound effects and sound effects editing are also terrific.John Schwartzman's cinematography is reasonably good. His use of the `shaky cam' technique is reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan.Hans Zimmer's melodramatic musical score suits the vast scale of the film nicely.With a little bit more care placed in the editing, better actors, and a tighter script; Pearl Harbor could have been the gem it was made out to be through its extensive advertising.",1,0,0,28 May 2001
Saving Private Ryan," This time the mission is a man...
","This is one of the most powerful and emotionally moving movies I have ever seen, it is a true modern work of art.  The story is a extraordinary with many well defined characters brought together by the incredible acting.  The story shows us the American side of the war and our feeling towards the Germans, but it also shows the cruelty we showed towards them, too.  Steven Spielberg does an absolutely wonderful job in capturing the horror of war, a prime example of this would be the D-Day landing sequence and the final battle.  As I said before, the acting is fantastic, especially Tom Hanks' performance as a Captain Miller.  The music has that grand, powerful feel to it which is what you come to expect from John Williams.  Do yourself a favor and watch this classic.",9,0,0,5 April 2000
Die Hard," This is the greatest action movie ever.
","Die Hard has all the qualities that make a good action movie: great villain, likeable hero, good one-liners, and of course awesome action sequences. The story has often been duplicated but never equaled in greatness. The direction and acting are pretty good. I think Alan Rickman's Hans is ONE of the best cinematic villains ever. The music is pretty good and occasionally does a good job at adding to the intensity. This is an instant action-classic!",9,3,3,16 May 2000
The Green Mile," I tried to take it back, but it was too late...
","This film is definetly a modern classic! The story is excellent, filled with many wonderful, well-defined, strong, characters. There are some truly intense moments in this film. There is a definite line between good and evil shown here. This is one of the few films I have seen where the acting is solid, all the way around. Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan are absolutley fantastic. Frank Darabont does a great job at capturing that old fashioned feel of the films of the 1930s. Do yourself a favor and watch this classic.",8,0,0,8 April 2000
Jaws," Jaws was the first real summer blockbuster, and to this day it's still the best.
","Unlike most blockbusters of today, Jaws was blessed with a superb cast, a fantastic director, and a good screenplay.Most of Jaws's success can be attributed to Steven Spielberg's masterful direction. He brilliantly utilizes the Hitchcockian method of showing less and there by giving the audience more.  By not showing the shark for the first half of the movie and only showing the evidence of its strength and the aftermath of its attacks, Spielberg triggers the audience's imagination making the film all the more suspenseful. Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb's screenplay is well written. Now granted, this is not a brilliant character study but the script is more character driven than most of today's blockbuster scripts. Evidence of the screenplay's strong characters can be found in the extraordinary chemistry between them and their motives for their actions. The cast does a fantastic job at giving life and voice to the characters of the screenplay. Roy Scheider wisely underplays his character, Martin Brody, making him very believable. Robert Shaw is absolutely wonderful as the sea-worn fisherman, Quint. Richard Dreyfuss is very convincing as the energetic, young scientist. Lorraine Gary gives a very naturalistic performance as Brody's wife. Murray Hamilton does a nice job at playing the greedy, sleazy mayor of Amity; the town endangered by the shark.Bill Butler's cinematography is first-class. He brings the ocean right into our laps by placing the camera at the water's level. Although there are many continuity errors, Verna Fields's editing is smooth and fast paced. Despite the fact that the shark is not seen for the first half of the film, the movie still manages to be suspenseful and interesting.
John Williams's musical score, for this film, has reached legendary status for good reason. His simple use of a few notes to characterize the shark was ingenious. He brings the suspense/action scenes to life with his energetic score.Many people complain that the shark looks too fake. Do sharks really look all that life-like to begin with? I personally think the shark effects could have been much worse; they weren't that bad.All of these fine qualities are why Jaws has remained one of my favorite films for quite some time.",10,3,7,12 June 2001
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Embracing the Dark Side never felt so good!
","After the somewhat disappointing first two entries of Lucas's new 'Star Wars' trilogy, I was worried that 'Star Wars: Episode III ¬ñ Revenge of the Sith' would follow the same path and prove to be a letdown. I tried to remain optimistic since this was the final entry in the saga and the very nature of the events which would inevitably transpire on screen might allow for an exceptional film. On the evening of May 18th, as I impatiently waited for the eminent midnight screening, my enthusiasm and excitement matched that of a small child on Christmas Eve. A few hours later, I had finally seen 'Revenge of the Sith'. I can thankfully say that it was, in fact, very much like revisiting my childhood. There were moments during the screening where I could not help but stare in wide-eyed amazement at the screen, raise up my hands and clap, or murmur excitedly to my friend seated next to me.Like most of the 'Star Wars' films, 'Sith' suffers from some clunky lines of dialogue, which include, 'From my point of view, the Jedi are evil' and 'You're so beautiful¬ÖIt's because I love you'. However, such poorly written lines of dialogue are few and far between when compared to a film like 'Attack of the Clones'. Lucas's strength as a writer has always been crafting a good story, and he has set himself up for quite a story to tell! 'Episode III' inescapably culminates with such drama and tragedy and is presented with such captivating visuals and riveting action that I didn't particularly mind a few moments of poor dialogue.Another integral factor in lessening the blandness of the dialogue is its markedly improved performances. Ewan McGregor does a splendid job at channeling Alec Guinness, the British actor who originated the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi in the original 'Star Wars'. McGregor seems comfortable in the 'Star Wars' universe. Finally breaking free of the woodenness that plagued his performances in the previous two films, McGregor's emotional output at the conclusion of his duel with Darth Vader is truly moving. Ian McDiarmid, portraying Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, is also worthy of special mention as he seduces Anakin to the Dark Side with subtlety and menace. Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman, while still occasionally stiff and uncomfortable with some of their ham-fisted dialogue, have developed a nice bit of chemistry. The two share a moment, a wordless exchange prior to Anakin's descent into darkness that is beautifully acted, scored, and edited and not only enhances their relationship but offers a great sense of foreboding. Frank Oz rounds out the cast with his as-always incomparable vocal interpretation of Jedi Master Yoda.All the production departments have substantially raised the bar for 'Episode III'. Stylistically, the film is very different from most other 'Star Wars' films. Resembling 'The Empire Strikes Back', Lucas's cinematographer bathes the characters in shadow, illuminating their eminent fates and the tragedy of the story. John Williams has composed yet another unforgettable musical score that ranges from operatic to ominously atmospheric. The meandering and tasteless political dialogue of the previous two films have been excised, allowing 'Revenge of the Sith' to move at a break-neck pace which imparts a sense of urgency and events spiraling out of control. With many plot threads going on simultaneously, the film left me feeling breathless without coming across as rushed or disorganized. Finally, you can't talk about 'Star Wars' without mentioning its visual effects. 'Revenge of Sith' boasts an unprecedented volume of computer generated imagery. The highlight of the special effects work is perhaps the opening space battle which is both visually and sonically arresting. Entire shots are composed completely within the computer. While Lucas occasionally goes overboard and loses focus in the midst of such CGI-mayhem, the effects work on this film has greatly improved upon the work done in 'Episode I' and 'Episode II'. Computer generated Yoda is particularly strong as the character has understated yet clear emotional responses to the events going on around him.The joy in watching 'Revenge of the Sith' comes from over 20 years of waiting and anticipating how the saga will draw to a close. There are so many hallmark moments in this film that fans know must happen. Audiences know that all the Jedi must die and that Anakin will fall from grace and become Darth Vader. One might argue that such knowledge would sap the film of any potential tension. On the contrary, the realization of these scenes elevates the film to something of a modern Greek tragedy. When watching 'Revenge of the Sith', one can see fate at work.After having seen 'Revenge of the Sith', I don't think I can ever look at the original trilogy the same way again. Vader's already substantial character has been given far more depth and the trilogy, as whole, now contains far more emotional resonance. Small, seemingly unimportant lines such as Yoda's line in 'Return of the Jedi', 'Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor,' have been given far more weight and significance. 'Revenge of the Sith' advances the entire saga, not just Lucas's original trilogy. The admittedly grating depiction of juvenile Anakin in 'Episode I' will now come off as a stark and poignant contrast after having seen what becomes of the small boy from Tatooine.As the credits began to roll at the conclusion of 'Episode III', I had never felt so simultaneously exhilarated and depressed at the end of a film. The best thing I can say about 'Sith' is that, despite the great deal of enjoyment I have taken from the original trilogy, I did not want the inevitable events of this chapter to transpire. I wanted so much for Anakin to make the right decisions. Arousing such emotions and turmoil within an audience takes a great deal of care and balance. Bravo, George! A job well done!",4,1,4,26 May 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," A fantastic, powerful film.
","This film is destined to become a classic. It shows the human spirit in full force. The story is terrific with many wonderful characters. Morgan Freeman delivers a truly brilliant performance that received a well-deserved Academy Award nomination. Bob Gunton gives a wonderfully villainous, intense performance as Warden Norton. Darabont's direction is solid. The climax is wonderfully uplifting. On a personal note, I thought this film slowed down at times but these sequences were essential to the plot, they just seemed to distract me. This film is definetly worth a look.",10,0,0,15 June 2000
The Silence of the Lambs," In my opinion, The Silence of the Lambs is one of the greatest films ever made.
","It's not very often that a first class cast and a fine director come together to bring life to an absolutely wonderful screenplay as they do in The Silence of the Lambs. Ted Tally's script is a brilliant adaptation to a good book. It is unmatched in its use of characterization. The story is simple yet it works on a psychological level, thanks to the infamous Hannibal Lecter and his mind games with Clarice Starling.Jonathan Demme's direction is good. His close-ups of various actors' faces are well done and well placed in the film. Demme effectively creates some very suspenseful moments, in the film, through his direction and his use of the first person point of view.Anthony Hopkins delivers the greatest, most riveting performances ever, as the psychotic Dr. Hannibal `Cannibal' Lecter. Jodie Foster also delivers a brilliantly subtle performance as FBI trainee, Clarice Starling. Ted Levine does a wonderful job as the disturbed Jame 'Buffalo Bill' Gumb. Scott Glenn gives a commendable performance as Jack CrawfordHoward Shore gives a wonderfully haunting musical score that adds a lot of atmosphere to the film. Tak Fujimoto's cinematography is also first-rate. His use of lights, especially red lights to make the audience uneasy, is very effective.
The editing by Craig McKay is marvelous, particularly the intercutting between the exterior of the wrong house in Calumet City and the interior of the right house in Belvedere, Ohio. All of these aspects make The Silence of the Lambs one of the greatest, if not the greatest film ever made.",10,0,2,13 June 2001
Blade Runner," Blade Runner is the most beautiful and poetic film I've ever seen.
","Everything about Blade Runner, from its exceptional music and script to its brilliant direction; oozes with substance and style. The screenplay, by Hampton Fancher and Philip K. Dick, is well written and intelligent. The dialogue is smart, philosophical, and meaningful.
The cast does a fine job at bringing voice to the script. Harrison Ford delivers a fine performance as the troubled Blade Runner, Rick Deckard. Rutger Hauer quite possibly gives the best performance of the film, though. Hauer plays the replicant, Roy Batty, whom is searching for a way to prolong his life. He delivers his lines with menace and with a sorrowful undertone. Sean Young and Daryl Hannah also give noteworthy performances.Ridley Scott is in top form here. As in Alien, he shows us that he has a very fine eye for details. His vision of Los Angeles in 2019 is frightening gritty and dark.Jordan Cronenweth's cinematography is extraordinary. His use of lighting is quite effective. Vangelis's jazzy blues music suits the images on screen nicely and adds a lot of soul to the film. The gothic set design of Blade Runner is incredible and help bring Ridley's vision to life. Blade Runner is, in my opinion, one of the finest science fiction films ever made.",10,0,0,26 May 2001
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," May the Force be with you...
","This classic science fiction movie enforced the idea of the 'summer blockbuster' that was created by Steven Spielberg's 'Jaws' two years earlier.  The story is very good, it includes many interesting aliens, locations, and spaceships.  There is a wide range of incredible characters. Alec Guinness delivers a fantastic performance as the veteran Jedi Knight, Obi Wan Kenobi.  This film also introduces one of cinema's greatest villains, Darth Vader, The Dark Lord of the Sith.  The special effects are fair by today's standards.  The music lives up to what you come to expect from John Williams.  The score gives the movie that old fashioned, golden feel.  Do yourself a favor and watch this classic.",10,0,0,29 March 2000
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Strong is Vader...
","The story is very dark, far darker than the first.  This film introduces many new exotic locations as well as a few new characters such as the Jedi Master, Yoda.  The film has one of the finest climaxes of any film I've seen.  The movie shows the true power of the dark side and the evil of Darth Vader.  The music is just as good as it was in the first, here we are introduced to the notorious Imperial March.  More is done with stop motion animation but other then that the special effects are just as good as the were in the previous film.  Do yourself a favor and watch this classic.",10,0,0,31 March 2000
Gladiator," Gladiator is a slightly flawed, but never the less entertaining, blockbuster.
","Gladiator provided one of the very few enjoyable movie-going experiences of 2000.David H. Franzoni's screenplay is adequate. It's clich√©d and doesn't introduce any new ideas or concepts to the genre but it is still entertaining. The cast does a fairly nice job at giving life to their roles. Russell Crowe does a great at putting the human back in the hero in his role as Maximus. He does a good job at bringing ferocity and nobility to the character of Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix is pretty good as the disturbed villain, Commodus. Some of Joaquin's more emotional scenes are a little over the top and hammy, though. Oliver Reed is wonderful at bringing a hardness and edge to the character of Proximo. Connie Nielsen and Richard Harris also give commendable performances.Hans Zimmer's score is fantastic. During the battle scenes it is effectively powerful and energetic and during the more dramatic scenes it is very sorrowful and mournful.The set and costume designs in Gladiator are very good; they bring out the splendor and glory that was ancient Rome. The CGI effects are acceptable but sometimes it is evident that the images seen on the screen were generated from a computer. Ridley Scott is in top form as usual; the film carries his wonderful stylistic flare.Pietro Scalia's editing, and Scott's direction brings the grisly battle scenes to life. Scalia utilizes quick cuts for the battle scenes, which prove to be very effective. His editing does falter however; at times the film tends to drag on a bit too long. John Mathieson's cinematography is one of the films poorer qualities. The camera movement is occasionally too bumpy and some of the images appear to be too murky and dirty. Overall, Gladiator is a good film; one of the few enjoyable films of 2000.",8,1,2,29 May 2001
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Sharing your adventures is an interesting experience...
","This is, in my opinion, the best Indy film of the series. It is a terrific action movie with bits of humor. The character of Indiana Jones is further developed in this movie. Sean Connery and Harrison Ford work wonderful as 'father and son'. This idea of 'father and son' adds humor to the wonderful story. What makes this entry slightly different then the two previous films is that Indy is not only searching for the Holy Grail but he is also searching for a antiquity that is more rare then the Holy Grail or any of the artifacts he was searching for in the predecessors, Indy is searching for his father. The music is good. The acting is great especially Sean Connery's performance as Dr. Henry Jones. Do yourself a favor and watch this classic.",9,3,5,18 April 2000
