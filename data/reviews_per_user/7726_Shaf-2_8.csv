Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A word to the naysayers...
","If you truly want to comprehend the impact a movie like Episode I is capable of delivering, the only way to see it is with somebody who has never seen the older trilogy.  I've had the good fortune of doing this, and the look on this person's face, the absolute delight at the visual wonders and magnificently simple story-telling, was worth the price of admission for both of us.  If you can do this and still state that this movie lacks the soul of the original trilogy, well, phooey.  You're wrong.Opinions of this movie were formed well before it was finished ... well before anyone knew anything about it, in fact.  The die-hard fans could have been subjected to a showing of Speed 2 and claimed it to be a masterpiece, while the naysayers could have seen a movie with twice the impact of Citizen Kane and still proclaimed it to be a piece of crap.  In a very real way, this movie is an inkblot test: your opinion of it says more about yourself than it does about the movie.As for myself, well, I feel sorry for anyone that doesn't love this movie. To take an object of such pure imagination and dissect it, searching for flaws, is to miss the point.  No single specific criticism has been made of The Phantom Menace that can't also be made of the original trilogy, but these criticisms aren't important.  What matters is the fact that these movies are the visual realization of an amazing imagination, contained within a mythological story of good versus evil, told in a way that will, with time, transcend the criticisms of it that have been made thusfar.Lucas knows how to tell a story the way stories were originally meant to be told.  He wowed us once, with a trilogy that has defied its aging and will forever remain a classic.  20 years later, he's showing us he hasn't missed a beat.",Null,0,0,3 June 1999
As Good as It Gets," Good but overlong...
","2 hours and 18 minutes seems a little bit long for a movie which was essentially nothing more than an excuse for a few very good actors to deliver a few very good lines.  Most of what you can get in terms of entertainment value out of this movie could be gained from watching the highlights of the best quotes.All of the actors did extremely well with their roles, and deserved their awards and nominations, and the screenplay had a lot of good lines but could have used a bit more plot.  I enjoyed this movie as I watched it but had a sour taste in my mouth after it was over.  This is a pretty good movie, but not as good as it could have been.",Null,0,1,6 September 1998
Romeo + Juliet," Almost watchable ... unfortunately, not quite
","I saw a High School Theatre production of Romeo and Juliet a couple months ago, and was amazed how closely it came in entertainment value to Baz Luhrmann's on-screen adaptation.Granted, this High School didn't make an attempt at modernization, but instead tried a production closer to what the bard was intended, but watching this I still came to a revelation; it's not the attempt to bring the classic play into the 90's that sinks this film, but instead, the sophomoric, high-school quality acting.In this production, the male and female leads were actually pretty good, and had a feel for the dialogue.  I was reminded of Danes and DiCaprio, who knew what they were doing, and made every scene that they had together work very well.  Unfortunately, they eventually got sunk by the actors surrounding them, whose idea of emotional Shakespeare is to scream their lines as loudly as possible.It's almost a shame that Miriam Margoyles (Juliet's Nurse) and Pete Postlethwaite (The Friar) are in this movie; they remind us what good Shakespeare is supposed to sound like.  And their all-too-brief scenes raise the bar for the rest of the actors, who, unfortunately, fall very short.It's not the direction or attempts at modernization which eventually sinks this movie, but instead the lack of support for Danes, DiCaprio, Margoyles, and Postlethwaite, which lowers Lurhmann's production to the level of a High School play.  It's almost watchable, if you let yourself sink into the concept, but not to the standards of what a good movie (let alone good Shakespeare) should be.",Null,0,1,17 January 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Stands to reason...
","...that the grossly cynical and horrifically misguided review that graces the imdb entry's front page would be written by someone that doesn't know the difference between 'its' and 'it's'.  Or, for that matter, someone who claims that the movie abuses its source material but then proceeds to take to task plot points that stems directly from the book.A defining movie for our times.  The power of LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring in its nearly-perfect filmic form goes to illustrate just how effective the source material is to begin with - just how good a story it tells.  The movie is impressive in its own right, bringing an epic feel to the screen that hasn't been seen since Hollywood's Golden Age, and that accomplishes it via a revolution in technology, special effects, and meticulousness.  Expect the genre of fantasy filmmaking to receive its long-overdue true genesis as a direct result of Peter Jackson's efforts to bring the genre's most classic story to life.  The movie is every bit as groundbreaking as the books were.",Null,0,0,13 November 2002
Armageddon," Don't call it an action movie...
","Armageddon is to action as porno is to romance.  Real action movies involve logical, realistic decisions which lead to intense situations, just as romance movies do to lead to emotional ones.  This movie, just like porno, throws all that out the window, and attempts to entertain only on a visceral level.  The result works ... but only if you're into that sort of thing.'Oh my God!  This [insert object here] is about to explode!!!'  'Hey ... did someone order a ... pizza?'",Null,0,1,4 August 1998
Dark City," An enchanting masterpiece
","Alex Proyas' 'Dark City' is perhaps one of the best science fiction movies ever made.  Enchanting and well-made in every aspect of its vision, the script is beyond intelligent, and the direction makes good use of perfect acting and grandiose special effects.To view this movie is to sit back in splendor as the secrets are revealed, one by one, piling on top of each other for the entire length of the plot, crecendoing to a climax that is as psychologically complex as it is just plain cool.  From the opening credits to the final shot, suspension of disbelief is automatic, and we become one with these characters and the strange lives they live.Enormously immersing and a great deal of fun, this is one not to miss.And on a sidenote, the absence of this film's name in the Oscar nominations is a travesty, particularly in the categories of Visual Effects and Art Direction.  It should have been a shoo-in to win both.",10,1,2,9 March 1999
Good Will Hunting," A spectacular achievement of screenwriting and acting
","Those who call Good Will Hunting 'predictable' are missing the point.  This is a movie that shines on dialogue, both comedic and dramatic, that is written and delivered with a poetic flair.  The humorous sequences will have you laughing out loud (I especially liked the 'Sandwich purchased on lay-away' bit), and the drama will hit you like a punch to the stomach.  Suspension of disbelief was immediate, even with the premise, and it held me inthralled throughout its length.  Sure, the ending is predictable, but it's the journey, and not the destination, that made Good Will Hunting the best film of 1997.",10,1,4,4 August 1998
Mission: Impossible," Strong, tense thriller ... but pay attention!
","Joining other recent thrillers such as 'The Usual Suspects' and 'L.A. Confidential' in the realm of mind-twisting suspense, 'Mission: Impossible' puts a solid stamp into the genre.  While it's not as good as the above two movies, it is worthwhile, intelligent entertainment, though not for the cerebrally challenged.Those who dismiss it as too confusing have most likely been spoon-fed for a bit too long on a few key movie trends as of late.  Recently, in order to not baffle its audience, a movie has not only had to present everything such that what is happeneing is exactly but it seems, but everything has to be repeatedly explained in monosyllabic words.  Thankfully, the occasional flick such as this comes around that doesn't assume the audience has a collective IQ below 70.For the movie itself, the acting is strong, with Cruise casted perfectly as Ethan Hunt, and a surprisingly effective cameo by Emilio Estevez.  The plot hums along, and the heist scene is one of the most suspenseful I've seen in a while.  If you are capable of paying attention, and do, this is a very fun movie to watch.",Null,0,0,18 October 1998
