50 First Dates," A pleasant surprise
","50 First Dates is a pretty big mix. There's some traditional Adam Sandler humour, there's some hilarious lines and situations while there's also some that are just not... even though they meant to be. There's a romantic story, that is really nice and cute to watch. There's also a twist that kind of mixes 'Memento' into this whole story making it one of the most original romantic comedies recently.Adam Sandler is not different than other of his roles, while Drew Barymore is just great. There is some laugh-out-loud jokes and a cute romantic story plus an original twist.Overall it's an easy and nice watch, that you should enjoy in many ways!50 First Dates is a very pleasant surprise in the genre.",7,4,6,25 April 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," Dark, violent and sad (fantasy?) tale, that is not flawless but the ending will leave you thinking for at least a while...
","Pan's Labyrinth is a movie, that starts out like Alice in Wonderland. But during the war. And with the scenes happening in the real world, too. Including the sadistic captain, stepfather to plot's main character - Ofelia. The movie can be described by many words, but there are a few that definitely fit to it perfectly. It's not a masterpiece. I don't think so, there were flaws in the screenplay, in the direction, too, but here one might argue. It has lots of strange, weird scenes as fantasy is involved. It's dark and shockingly and brutally violent. It's getting more and more complex as the plot goes on, adding new subplots and leading, finally, to a great finale.The ending is something that changes a grade for this movie from 6 for making, meaning sets, makeup, special effects, pictures, acting which is all flawless to solid 8, for a great, beautiful and extremely sad, symbolical tale with lots of lessons to learn and things to think about after the watch.It's one of those movies, that you know how they say, you'll either love it or hate it? well, maybe not that extreme here, I would say, but its one of those movies that you won't just stand by it not moved by it at all. The ending completes the story, adding it a much better, more complex outlook creating a dark, violent and sad tale that will leave you thinking for at least a while.",8,1,7,1 April 2010
Twilight," Nice cinematography and great music!
","OK, so Twilight, a movie which almost every (usually female but not only) teen saw, after reading the book. I haven't seen the movie up to now, and I've never read the books so the only thing I'm reviewing is the actual movie by itself.TWILIGHT opens with a well-shot action sequence that shows already two main reasons to watch this movie - cinematography (also the blue, cold filter through most of the movie was a great idea!) and score by Carter Burwell (most of Coen Brothers' movies) who did a great job. His 'Bella's Lullaby' is simply beautiful and the rest of the score includes some great, suspenseful music with the use of both drums and the guitar. The film also features some popular songs, which work well with the movie.As the story goes - it's not a horror. Not in a bit. It's a teen-romance with vampires in it. The story is nothing amazing but enjoyable as it is something new, I have to say.The acting. Robert Pattison is really BAD. I heard he's a better actor than it looks here, well, I'll have to see it myself, but most of Twilight (with maybe the exception of the last, dancing scene) he's terrible.Kirsten Stweart had better roles before Twilight (Into The Wild) but here she's not that bad either.The screenplay is pretty stupid at times and definitely shortened from the book, some poor direction and funny scenes that weren't supposed to be funny, but still it is an enjoyable watch!For those two, main reasons..",6,0,2,28 March 2010
2012," A whole new lev... size, of disaster movies!
","I admit, as a kid I loved disaster movies, and I don't know what is it about them, but they are always enjoyable and thrilling and watching building collapse, tornados pick them up etc. was always great fun. Not only for me.When I first saw the trailer for 2012, I thought 'Damn, this will be a good disaster movie! Look at those special effects!' and then I thought that I had similar expectations after seeing previous Emmerich's blockbuster - 10.000 BC, which turned out to be.. eh.. that's not the review. Let's go back to 2012.So, apart from the effects I saw in the trailer, the cast didn't look bad - John Cusack and Amanda Pett (funny.. I just saw the Identity the night before), Danny Glover, Thandie Newton and... Woody Harrelson. The acting in the movie is decent, but nothing amazing.... only Harelson gives a great performance being also most colorful character of the plot.As the plot goes, it's Emmerich - so the great Americans are saving the whole world once again, the president is black and everything is ultra-politically-correct while every single piece of the story i surprising and as far from being original as it's possible.So what is good, you may ask? Well.. the effects! I have to say, no matter what people say about this movie, it might be just heaven for hardcore disaster movies fans. Of course, the CGI is nothing compared to Avatar (it's still perfect though!) and such, but that's not the point. The SIZE is the point. The destructions are amazingly big, perfectly shot with clear, realistic CGI and some scenes are easily breathtaking. And even though I gave the movie a 6, it's basically for Harelson and... the destruction. And still, I wish I had seen it in the cinemas.Trust me, the disasters in the movies have never been so powerfully huge and enormous yet!",6,0,1,29 March 2010
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," 'Twilight' was decent... 'New Moon' is worse.
","OK, so, I've never read the books, but I have to say Twilight was a decent movie (6/10). The cinematography was beautiful, the cold blue filter gave it a cool 'feel' and the most important thing - the music was great. The story was easy but nice to watch.Here, most of the pluses of the first one are gone, and most of the minuses of the first one are... even bigger. But from the beginning.The story is not bad, but the screenplay, I have to say, it's AWFUL. It makes you feel like Rosenberg wrote it in a few days or even better just to get the paycheck. The dialogues are mostly terribly awkward, the storyline skips to fast making the story unbelievable etc.The acting now. Robert Pattison is NOT better. Maybe he wanted to be like that, maybe he was supposed to be just acting a cold guy with one face expression, that doesn't actually act at all, but seems to be tired of being on the plan, because he has some smiles (2 maybe?) that may suggest so, but that's to little. Kirsten Stewart, whom I thought was a good actress (after Into The Wild), and who I though played well in Twilight, here... it's not bad at all either. Surprise. I really liked her.The music. No 'Super Massive Black Hole' in the songs from the movie, no 'Bella's Lullaby', dramatic drums and Burwell's talent on the Score. Much more forgettable, but the main theme (Meadow) might be better than lots of music composed in the cinema in recent years. Beautiful. If only there was more...As the cinematography goes, no more cold blue filter here, but still some nice shots. The best scene, I though, was a scene with 'Hearing Daamge' song in the forest, hunting for Victoria. Very nicely shot and edited, working with the music well. Only hope the whole movie was that way....",5,5,11,28 March 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Pure magic!
","I have to say that I'm not familiar with neither Disney animated version, any other film adaptations or the books themselves. I knew the basics of the story, I enjoyed some Tim Burton movies very much and I liked the special effects in the stills I saw, so I decided to go ahead and give it a try.Alice In Wonderland is a film you WANT to see in Imax, as in my opinion which I'm not afraid to proudly stand - the 3D is more impressive than in Avatar. Not the special effects, don't get me wrong, the 3D itself, some sequences are really impressive.I mentioned special effects - here, I'm pretty sure there are no competitors for an Oscar for 2010! Simply perfect!The plot is crazy but that's how it's supposed to be, the characters the same with Johnny Depp in another flawless performance leading the group as a Mad Hatter. Lots of great creatures, talking animals etc. that you'll love.The world Burton created competes with Pandora pretty equally, it's the matter of opinion, but the magic is seen everywhere. The costumes and makeup are sure Oscar nominations.But enough about MAKING, let's say something about the MOVIE.Well, alright. The movie is a little bit more than 1.5h of pure magic. I caught myself watching this spectacle with open mouth, smiling all the time. What we see is again the work of great imagination, and perfect film-making.Awesome adventure!",9,3,5,20 March 2010
Avatar," Feast for an eye, not much more, but... who cares?
","AVATAR... is fun. It's huge fun. The whole movie is huge. There is everything here, there is enormous explosions, shootings, space ships, but that's not the best part.The best part of Avatar is the world that Cameron created. And that world AMAZES however we think about the plot. It's perfectly designed, totally believable and simply beautiful. And magic. It is magic. It's not Tim Burton's magic, it's different magic. BIGGER, more epic and simply - breathtaking. Enough about it.The story is new Pocahontas but some good messages mixed in. The acting is decent but nothing award-worthy here, apart from an evil military guy who was really good.The movie is epic, and whatever you and your friend think about it, YOU NEED TO GO OUT AND SEE IT, IN 3D! because this movie, -even though not a success at the Oscars (well, effects were certain, pictures a surprise but still not that many here) - will, and already did, make a history becoming real fast the biggest grossing film in HISTORY of the world. And I think the movie that will beat it, will be Avatar 2 Cameron's is planning to start working on real soon.Trust me, you want to see it.",8,1,4,20 March 2010
Mystic River," into the Mystic...
","The Mystic River is another example, after Million Dollar Baby of Clint Eastwood's flawless directing. The scenes are made with perfection. The story for some may be only a 'who's the killer?' crime but even though trying to solve the crime is still exciting here, that's not exactly the whole point. The point of the story is the exploration of human soul, humans, what do we do, when and why, what can cause what...The strongest part of the movie are performances, especially by Sean Penn, but also Tim Robbins and a lot more. They're one of the best performances in years of film-making, for sure.The story itself and the plot in my opinion at parts is to slow, but now that I think about it, I think it might have been because I was really sleepy and it was late as I can't - analyzing the whole movie - think of one single scene that was either unnecessary or not strong enough. That's directing enough.The story, after the ending makes you sit for a while and think about what you just saw and that's good. It's dark, it's surprising, it's very emotional and believable. It's a very good movie, but somehow I seem to think that Gone Baby Gone made me sleep less nights thinking abut what would I do, who was right, blah blah blah, but as the directing and performances as well as the plot itself - Mystic River is a simply strong and important movie.",8,0,0,20 March 2010
Man on Fire," A modern masterpiece!
","Man On Fire tells a story of an ex-special forces guy with a drinking problem who accepts a job as a personal bodyguard of a little girl in Mexico during the wave of kidnappings for ransom. At first he's not to friendly, but then they befriend with each other, he decides to stop drinking etc., etc... then one day she gets kidnapped... and killed...And HE, won't stop at anything to get the revenge.That's basically the story of Man On Fire but expect some big twists at least a few times including the ending which is beautiful and will probably make you cry.That's also because of the great music Harry-Gregson Williams with Lisa Gerrard (Gladiator) composed.But the strongest part of the movie... wait... the thing is, everything here is perfect.First - acting. Denzel Washington is at his best, Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken good as always, great Radtha Mitchell and AMAZING young Dakota Fanning. And that's not the end of the list...Then come the cinematography which is dazzling and along with superb editing, should have won an Oscar for sure.The story is... not just a revenge movie. The story is intelligent, the story makes you think... and is pure beautiful. Really.This is one of those movies you need to see in your lifetime, at least once!",10,0,1,21 March 2010
The Blind Side," Highly overrated!
","The Blind Side is a movie like a thousand others. It's the same movie that you can find on Sunday afternoon on TV, that nobody really has heard of before. Why was it such a blockbuster then?Honestly...? I have no idea!Yeah, the story is true, I know that, but even when the story is true you don't have to make a movie absolutely predictable - that's just bad directing. What's even worse is the screenplay - the dialogues are completely unrealistic, unbelievable and often simply trashy. Some scenes are like copied from B class trashy family movies. That's how bad it gets. As for the acting, the main character Big Mike - Quinton Aron - is just not really good, the scene when he's walking on the street 'being cold' is the best example of that and the sad facial expression gets boring pretty soon, he's still likable when he starts smiling etc. though. As for Sandra - nothing even close to being worthy for an Oscar NOMINATION, - and award is a joke. Not that I don't like her - it's just... just no.Overall, don't get me wrong, the movie is OK-made, it is enjoyable, it's a good movie for the whole family, that teaches values as... family and not only, and has got some pretty good Football scenes, but for those of you that prefer something better in the cinema, it's just not the right choice, sorry.Highly overrated!",6,1,1,22 April 2010
Never Back Down," Rocky for the new generation?
","Y'all remember Rocky right? Well, this is the Rocky new generation. For American teens in XXI Century. Is it bad, you can ask,? Well, depends what do you mean by that.Never Back Down continues the stereotype of American teens driving Ferrari-s and other cool sport cars, organizing huge pool parties with half-naked girls including open lesbians in their parents' houses and not doing anything else in their free time but that and maybe fighting.The story is predictable from the very beginning to the very end, using every possible theme already used somewhere before. The teen that's poorer, bad relationship with his mother, falls in love with a girl, a girl uses him asked by her boyfriend. Her boyfriend beats him up... blah, blah, blah. I don't want to spoiler for anyone so that's it's it about the story from me.So,... why the hell did I give this movie an 8 out of 10, you may ask?Well, I did gave this movie an 8 out of 10, for a few reasons actually.First, for a great role, as always, by Djimon Hounsou. Secondly, the movie enters a new era, by showing the world MMA. Finally. I admit, I am writing this as not only a fan, but a fighter, myself, but the movie shows MMA at its finest. Of course, it is pg-13, of course some things are made to look more effective than useful, but it shows a great difference between a fight and... a fight.The scenes of training are very well edited, shot and feature great music (not the score, but a perfect choice of popular rock/rap and other songs are the best thing in this soundtrack). The same with actual fight scenes.The movie tells a predictable but e very enjoyable story, it is another American-teen movie and not really at the same time. It tells a lesson, it may show some people that Mixed Martial Arts is not Human CockFighting and as a sport movie should be - the training and actual fight scenes indeed ARE very inspirational and powerful!",8,0,1,28 March 2010
Up in the Air," A breeze of fresh air...
","UP IN THE AIR comes with a breeze of fresh air. It tells a story about a guy that basically lives on the airplanes travelling around the US and telling people they're fired. No relations, no settlement. But two things change in his life. One - he gets a young girl to train for the work and he meets a woman who seems to have a similar life, he does. It's an intelligent, original and fresh (finally!) (a little bit dark) comedy/ drama, with realistic characters, great performances (3 main stars, 3 Best Role Nominations - now that's a trio!) and most importantly - clever, witty dialog and a great, surprising story, that stays in your head for quite a while.",10,0,3,20 March 2010
