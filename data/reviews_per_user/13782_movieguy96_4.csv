The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Underwhelming but entertaining enough
","I like The Hunger Games series. I'm not a die-hard fan by any means (I haven't read the books, nor am I into teen fiction), but I enjoyed the first two films, especially Catching Fire, which displayed a great combination of thrills, humour and tragedy.Mockingjay Part 1 felt like a bit of a letdown in comparison though. By all accounts there was really no need to split the third book into two parts anyway, and it's all too clear to see on screen. It's like what Deathly Hallows Part 1 was to Harry Potter, a slow plodding instalment in the franchise, made purposely to make more of a profit for the studios involved, and to apparently flesh out the characters' backstories and plight.Someone obviously forgot to tell the writers and director this almost kills the movie dead, and reduces the whole thing to a snail's crawl.I didn't hate the movie by any means. There's a few good intense scenes in the film to sustain one's interest until the end, and it's interesting to see how the overall story of The Hunger Games develops here, plus the cast, as with the previous entries, is a joy to watch, notably Donald Sutherland, still quietly menacing as President Snow, newbie to the series Julianne Moore as the commanding President Coin of District 13, the always watchable Woody Harrelson, and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, who brings some much needed warmth and humour to the film. Among all this though, nothing much really happens in the end, aside from a few skirmishes to keep the viewer entertained now and again, and Jennifer Lawrence delivers an unusually one-note performance, compared to her other stints as Katniss. It's like she's been told to act more moody and glum than usual so we feel sorry for her, which backfires, with certain set pieces made to show her anger and rebelliousness towards the Capitol, which here somehow feels a bit too fake and staged. She does try hard though with a rather uneven script, and doesn't disgrace herself. All the young cast acquit themselves well with the plot, especially Liam Hemsworth, and Josh Hutcherson, but some people, such as Natalie Dormer, are virtually wasted. Not that it harms the movie, mind.Overall though, compared to the colourful excitement and buzz over Catching Fire, this film feels like the brakes have been applied to the franchise, and is consequently all the more dull and soulless because of it. Hopefully Part 2 will put everything firmly back on track, because after watching this, you will feel satisfied enough, but because the inconsistent pace and mood rather distances the audience from the characters and the movie itself, it also puts a dampener over the overall hype of how it will all end in the last film.",5,16,29,24 November 2014
Knives Out," A re-evaluation of Rian Johnson, with a tour de force ensemble!
","I'm pleased to say that Knives Out confounded my expectations in the most surprising and joyous way possible. One of the most enjoyable experiences I've had at the cinema in a long time, it not only pays homage and slyly subverts the conventions of the murder mystery genre, but it also made me re-evaluate my opinion of writer-director Rian Johnson as an artist in his own right.After the drubbing he got over Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Johnson's reputation has been stuck in the quagmire somewhat, a name synonymous to fandom as arguably sabotaging a much loved franchise. Whilst this matter is debateable in of itself, Knives Out showcases how much of an ingenious and skilled auteur Johnson can be, even more remarkable when working within the confines of a relatively modest setting and budget. This minimalist approach allows Johnson to be experimental; free reign to carve a richer canvass of quirky characters and surprising red herrings, which serve to enhance the plot and character's motivations rather than undermine it.I do not know what decision making process went into Johnson being chosen as directing SW: TLJ. I believe half the time the studio finds a director who produced a movie, or series of movies, which offer a uniquely immersive experience, or have showcased a idiosyncratic interpretation for movie-making in general, and given them the unfair burden of helming a multi-million dollar project which is totally incompatible with their skillset.I have literally just finished watching Looper on TV, for the second time after originally watching it in the cinema, and I was staggered by the narrative and tonal similarities with Knives Out, in terms of how the story unfolds in a nicely convoluted yet inventively slight manner. Johnson has never given himself more than what's he's needed in order to create his vision, EXCEPT with the notable exception of SW: TLJ, and therein my point is concluded.Johnson's audaciousness and prerogative to subvert expectations works so well when he's focused on a stand-alone project which he's conceived from the get-go, but taking responsibility for a tentpole movie which is a) expected to adhere to the conventions of the franchise/genre, b) please its die-hard fanbase, and c) fit in nicely with a gazillion dollar Disney gravy train; he was almost doomed to fail right from the start. That's just not Johnson's style, and the studio should've realised that.This is not to say I'm going to re-evaluate SW: TLJ as some sort of overlooked masterpiece. Far from it! It still has problems, quite a few in fact, but you want someone who's going to toe the party line, not an individual who does things his or her own way. To this end I believe that Johnson has suffered unfairly, purely because of the studio's naivety.But anyway, back to the movie...The way in which Knives Out unfurls in front of our very eyes is a masterclass in misdirection and cracking entertainment. The narrative is created purposely to focus the viewer on the here and now; to not let their minds wander. You hinge on every word and action. You could almost accuse the movie as being episodic with its shifting focus of multiple character strands, were they not interweaved together so delicately by Johnson's deft touch, and the enthusiastic portrayals by the ensemble cast at his disposal.Indeed, it's difficult to know where to start with a cast so large and talented. As with most movies with a multitude of big names, a lot of actors fade into the background, merely there to draw in the crowds while not actually contributing or enhancing the viewing experience. Knives Out, on the other hand, is a very different story.Each and every cast member lends their own personality to the piece, with passion and gusto. You could tell everybody was having a lot of fun making this movie, as Johnson's given them a lot of rich material to draw from and make their own. There seemed to be an overriding, and palpable, chemistry between the actors which meant you totally believed their relationships and motivational self-interests.With a canvas this large you'll forgive me for not singling out any specific names, however I must give special mention to of course Daniel Craig and Ana De Armas, the latter a revelation in her non-showy but memorable performance as a timid yet strong-willed caregiver, integral to the plot. In many ways she carries the movie, as the viewer is aligned with her from the very start, and she's the prism through which we see the infighting and breakdown of the Thrombey dynasty. To pull this off with a degree of believability, and more fundamentally likeability, required an actress who could showcase a series of subtle yet telling emotions to which the audience relates and understands. The fact De Arnas is a relative novice to the movie industry, with little opportunity to flex her acting muscles beforehand, makes her casting all the more inspired.Craig, though, is an absolute delight and hoot as the private detective tasked with solving the case. His exaggerated deep southern accent and clich√©d powers of deduction lend themselves greatly towards the eccentricities of the movie, and serve to enhance his character's affability and larger-than-life demeanour. Craig is definitely revelling in chewing the scenery (or probably more apt, furnishings) at every opportunity he gets.As for the supporting cast, I actually considered Lakeith Stanfield to be a perfect level-headed foil for Craig's more rambunctious character, and it was nice to still see Christopher Plummer in the spotlight with a tender, and affectionately wacky, portrayal of the family patriarch.Knives Out has its twists and turns at every corner, and dares the audience into questioning what they're seeing in front of their very eyes. Nothing is ever as straightforward as it seems, and Johnson is never satisfied with settling for a by-the-numbers and generic whodunit. He chooses to keep us delightfully bewildered and encapsulated with a cracking rollercoaster of a movie which is literally fun for the whole family!",9,0,2,22 December 2019
Avengers: Endgame," The best superhero movie ever, and why? (a 'brief' essay)
","I think there's a cynical generalisation that Avengers: Endgame, and by definition the MCU, belongs in the same category as the likes of Fast and Furious, or Transformers, i.e. a lazily produced, generic production line, superficial big-budget, dumbed down blockbuster; watering down any substance and story in order to appeal to the mass consumer market. This couldn't be further from the truth.In fact, it's that willingness to be more brave and take an un-patronising approach with the audience which enabled it to become the highest-grossing movie of all time.Marvel took a gamble. They decided not to appeal to the lowest common denominator, but instead weave a rich tapestry of character arcs and narrative exposition, which was developed to greater detail in the 'trilogy within a franchise', i.e. Civil War, Infinity War, and Endgame. Indeed, I struggle to think of another movie in the MCU that does so much justice to all the characters, or encapsulates their all too human traits in such profound and tragic detail.I say that purely on the basis of scale, and Endgame's ability to 'cover all bases'. Take Thor, for starters. Now I read in one review that Chris Hemsworth's performance (specifically the comedic elements) was too 'on the nose' and overplayed. I couldn't disagree more. The Thor we see in Endgame is a complete subversion of the borderline toxic masculinity that shrouds him in previous instalments. He's broken, pained, tortured, and Hemsworth captures that in a sublime tragicomic reinvention of the character. Never have the stakes been higher, and never has a superhero been more mentally ill-equipped and insecure to face his demons. I think as a viewer we empathise wholeheartedly with that. Not all heroes are the one-dimensional, cardboard cut-out, indestructible, and incorruptible knights akin to Dominic Toretto or Optimus Prime (although these characters do get corrupted at some point or another this is carried with nowhere near the same degree of authenticity or pathos as Thor's). His ego, and self-esteem, have been dented (no, decimated) by his 'failure' at the end of Infinity War/start of Endgame. It's Endgame which serves as a spiritual journey for him, to pick himself up and prove himself 'worthy' once more. This theme is underlying with most of the characters in the movie, in fact, but not in such a powerful, or personal, way as his. It's testament to Hemsworth that you don't know whether to cringe, laugh, or cry at his plight and instability. The term 'beautiful disaster' comes to mind.This may be just me, but I always thought of Captain America as something of a non-entity during the events of Infinity War. Come to think of it, that was almost certainly an intentional decision. After Civil War it's almost as if Steve Rogers is ashamed to be associated with the Captain America moniker (his dropping of the shield in the climax of that movie symbolic of his disbanding that identity altogether). He's become a more humbled shadow of his former self. You could debate therefore, that Steve depends on 'Cap' to harness his strength and resilience, that he's incomplete without him. In Endgame, though, we get a triumphant return to form. After the reality check that was the devastating resolution to Infinity War, his humbling has given him a newfound sense of heroism, confidence, and most importantly modesty. In my mind he's the stoic backbone, the rock in the team through which everyone gravitates around.Needless to say, the greatest character development comes in the form of Tony Stark. Robert Downey Jr's mesmerizing performance has been increasingly fine-tuned and nuanced as the MCU has progressed. In Endgame he finally comes full-circle. Once the selfish playboy millionaire who never truly stepped out of the shadow of his father's legacy, in Endgame his transformation is complete: making the ultimate sacrifice in a completely selfless act, but not before finding true fulfilment with the woman he loves, and finding true acceptance, or closure, with his father's influence in his life. The thing I found most profound with Tony in Endgame is his embodiment of 'the hero' archetype. For perhaps the first time ever in the franchise, in the form of his daughter Morgan, he doesn't need to wear the suit to be 'the hero'. He's just her dad, and that's enough. I think this is indicative to his character's journey from Iron Man. He no longer serves to his own self-interests, exacerbated through his previous use of grand posturing and artificial superpowers, but now rather displays truly heroic qualities from within, for the benefit of others. Tony Stark is the lynchpin which forms the emotional crux of the movie, made all the more heart-rending through the heightened sense of responsibility now bestowed upon him.One of the most surprising character departures comes in the form of Clint Barton, the reason being that in previous instalments there was always that feeling he was just there to make up the numbers. Maybe he'll pop a wisecracking one-liner, or show off some sick archery skills, but with no real depth through which the audience can truly engage with him. Fast-forward to Endgame, and we see him in a nightmarishly self-destructive spiral, slaughtering those he's decided are unworthy of having survived 'the snap', in some vain hope of avenging his families disintegration. Ironically, by the time we catch up with him in Tokyo any moral compass or conscience he may have possessed have disintegrated too, having turned into a violent mercenary alter-ego by the name of Ronin. It's a radical left-turn for the character, one which adds another layer of resonance into the failure and loss caused by the repercussions of Thanos's actions. Very similar to Thor you can see he's visibly traumatised, barely holding it together, ashamed, grieving, and now consumed by very un-heroic traits.Avengers: Endgame is just as must a story of redemption as it is a mission to reclaim the Infinity Stones. This truly is the fight of their lives, not just against a terrifying threat, but also against their own eroded feelings of self-worth and purpose. It's in this chaos that they must pull together, now more than ever. One of the notable additions to the movie which I must mention is, of course, Paul Rudd's Ant-Man, the comic relief whose presence brings some much-welcome levity to an otherwise sombre start, and adds to the delightful camaraderie which underpins the teams relationship.The 'three-act structure' (beginning, middle, end), as highlighted by film critic Mark Kermode, is utilised to daring and startling effect in Endgame. There's something very haunting and elegiac about the entire first-act. The filmmakers allow time for the audience to immerse, or acclimatise, themselves to this new colourless reality where the heroes are down on their luck, barely getting by, wandering around aimlessly and looking for a new sense of meaning in the fallout of 'the snap's' devastation. This in-turn heightens the emotional intensity, and as a result our allegiance to the characters, ready for the absolute sucker punch in the climax of the movie. We're just as determined as they are to prevail in the face of overwhelming odds.There's a scene, which one critic derided, where Natasha Romanoff breaks down in tears while trying to eat a sandwich calmly and collectively. He argued that this was silly and was just there to pad the film out. I think he missed the point entirely. This scene perfectly emphasis the futility of our heroes readjustment to this new reality. Natasha is falling apart at the seams, trying desperately to put on a brave face, in the face of an inevitable and tragic truth. Sometimes a simple piece of storytelling like this can hold a such deeper meaning or resonance.I was also very impressed by the reinterpretation of Thanos in Endgame, as opposed to him in Infinity War. Whereas before he was a world-weary conqueror, disillusioned and ruthless but ultimately led by a sincere impetus of moral righteousness, now he's a despotic tyrannical warlord. No longer interested in preserving the sanctity of life in the universe, instead he pursues a more greedy and egocentric ambition, to wipe out life as we know it altogether, starting from scratch and fashioning himself into a sort of false God. It's this despicability which makes Thanos an even more threatening presence, especially when compared to our now-vulnerable and emotionally scarred heroes. Josh Brolin delivers another magnetic performance, and without his involvement I do believe the success of the Infinity War and Endgame would've been seriously compromised.The climax, when it comes, is absolutely electrifying. Basically the culmination of a 22-film saga, it's the ultimate reward for an audience who have persevered and followed these characters throughout an astonishing multi-layered journey. It runs the entire gamut, right from when the holy trinity of Iron Man, Thor, and Cap face-off against Thanos, to Cap's worthiness to wield Mjolnir, to the spine-tingling emergence of the portals/resurrection of the rest of the Avengers, to the evening out of the odds, to the battle to end all battles, to the realisation that a sacrifice must be made, to the period of mourning and self-reflection afterwards, and finally the transition of Cap/Agent Carter's ethereal dance into the end-credits montage, which is the cherry on the cake.Personally I found that Endgame was satisfying on every emotional level, so much so I left the screening completely astounded and awestruck. It was truly epic in every sense of the word. The directing/scriptwriting team of The Russo Brothers, Christopher Markus, and Stephen McFeely should be lauded for their sheer commitment to the story and characters, and reluctance to sell-out for a quick buck. I think those who choose to disregard it as just 'lazy' and 'unimaginative' are cheating themselves of a hugely gratifying experience.",10,1,3,21 May 2020
Sicario," So-so-cario
","I saw this movie the other night so I'm writing this while it's still fresh in the mind.If I'm being honest I did find Sicario impressive in its scope and detail; Roger Deakins' cinematography being highlighted in all the other reviews. It's certainly a plus, and adds to the impending sense of dread and tension that are ever present throughout, but when looking back on it now you can see none of this really amounts to much.Emily Blunt's Kate Macer joins a group of operatives in searching for those responsible for a number of bombs and hideaways that have been located. Sure enough she finds the team aren't playing by the book. Seeming as she's been done over by her employers you can understand her inevitable resentment, especially when pitched against her occasionally uncompromising and unorthodox team, although her character almost resigns to being a caricature in certain moments, especially when in the final scenes she gets on her high horse over her superiors about what she sees as an unacceptable change in the mission objective (which is all for good really).Indeed, Blunt's sturdy performance is undermined by her characters' clich√©s. She's supposed to be a professional and tactful FBI agent, so as she constantly wallows in her loathing and disgust against the system (which reaches its' apex in her final scene), it comes across as self indulgent rather than sad, probably because those clich√©s are portrayed as deadly serious and 'realistic', something the film tries very much to be, and heavily exert on the audience. It becomes increasingly irritating. Equally as frustrating is how a woman with her skill set can't successfully defend herself against a corrupt cop she fights with in a rather intense struggle.There's solid supporting turns by Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro, the latter of which especially excelling in a role which barely gives anything away until the reveal in the climax; his world-weary tired expressions hiding a tortured and complicated persona. He has some of the most stand-out scenes in the film, especially in the aforementioned climax where he really comes into his own.Breaking Bad brilliantly portrayed the whole cartel network as a dark and subversive world which has wormed its' way into normal society. It was both harrowing and thrilling to watch, not least because it was mixed into a solid story of an everyday man interacting with this world, which had lasting consequences for either side, but because it developed basically; constantly growing ever deeper and darker and complex, while never losing its true focus.I can't say the same about this though. For all its' worth in how its' framed and constructed, you can't help asking yourself why did they bother making this film. Sicario is essentially a series of expertly staged but one-dimensional set pieces before moving along neatly to the end showdown, which incidentally barely involves the disillusioned Macer. It's a simplistic film disguised as a clever and intricate work of art.This isn't all to say it's a terrible film, because it's not. It's engrossing and intriguing in equal measure, in certain parts of the film that is, notably the opening and ending. The landscape is portrayed as haunting and unforgiving, and is essentially the main star of the piece, because it lends itself to the whole aesthetic of the movie. You simply don't know what's going to happen next; it's one of those movies, and yes, first time viewing there is a couple of rather distressing scenes. Once seen though, and when you realise it's just a basic serious drama, you may find it hard to have the patience to then sit through again what has become a slow and rather pretentious piece of cinema, especially when considering this story has been told before, and much, much, better, on the small screen. Forgettable.",5,26,48,19 October 2015
