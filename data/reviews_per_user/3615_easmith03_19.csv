The Blair Witch Project," Great Student Film. A complete rip off at the theater.
","The concept of making a movie from the spliced together films of a missing film crew, is a very clever concept.  And if you are in a college film class, I think you would be deserving of all of the praise and accolades possible.  However, when you release that student film as a movie, then you are ripping off people to present it as a real movie.  There is about enough material for a good 20 - 30 minute film, maybe.  But, stretching this one act play into a movie made it tedious and redundant.  And while the idea is clever, it wears thin  when stretched out.  Everyone has their own tastes, but I was surprised by the number of people who actually found the movie scary.  There are some things going bump in the night... but... nothing to really suggest you couldn't have defended yourself with a nice pointy stick. I'm usually hiding under my coat in horror movies, but I was looking at my watch as this one was winding down. *Yawn*",2,0,2,21 October 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," All style, no substance
","It is very stylish to sit around and have long discussions with someone you are about to try and kill... not very practical, but stylish. It is very stylish to research what kind of snake to use to kill someone with, and then to sit down calmly and explain to the dying victim why you chose that particular kind of snake... not very practical, not very believable, but very very stylish. It is not very practical to bury someone alive, and quite impossible to dig yourself out once buried... but, very very very stylish. Of course master Pai teaches no one the secret 5 pressure point punch... was there anyone watching the movie that didn't know exactly how Bill was going to die at that point? I could have wrote the last scene right then, right down to him dropping on his fifth step. How nice they had a few moments to express their admiration for one another before Bill took his last walk.I guess QT is an acquired taste, and I haven't got it yet. How wonderful for those fans of his that can be entertained by virtually no plot, and no drama. Even after he splits one movie into two movies and uses the clips off the cutting room floor. Maybe for his next movie, he won't have any plot at all. Just some random scenes of people being really cool... yeah... I smell an Oscar!",3,5,9,26 February 2005
Catch Me If You Can," Entertaining Drama/Comedy
","I found the movie to be top notch entertainment.  The acting was great, and the story was paced in a way that it didn't have any slow spots for me. There were enough laughs to make the movie seem quite light hearted.  But, there was also a dramatic element of the movie where you realize that Frank (DiCaprio) is committing crimes, and he is being tracked down.Frank leaves home as a 16 year old and begins a 'successful' career as a con man who uses the cover of a pilot, lawer, doctor, etc to help him to a life of riches as he uses his counterfit identifications to help him pass bad checks.  The FBI is always a step behind.  Frank seems to be able to get away with anything, and seems quite the clever con man.  But, you begin to realize that he is really just a very young man, who despite the adventures, is really quite lonely.Yes, he is a criminal and you do have to kind of root for 'bad guy' to get away to enjoy some of the drama in the movie.  However, I don't think I'll be giving away too much to say that he does eventually have to pay for his crimes.I had just finished the book just prior to seeing the movie.  And I do think the movie captures the spirit of the book.  However, I found a couple of things curious about the transformation to the screen. Apparently the book is embelished.  Probably several things in the book are presented more 'grand' than they actually occured, or just made up entirely. But, there were a couple of events in the book that might have been interesting in the move.  While the movie also adds some elements that weren't in the book at all.  Oh well, I enjoyed the book also, and it was a pretty easy read, so if you enjoyed the movie, you may want to consider reading the book also.",8,1,2,2 January 2003
The Ring," Top notch horror movie
","The ring delivers plenty of chills with out being a slasher movie and having 'buckets-o-blood'.  The movie is actually kind of a combination mystery/horror movie.  The rumor of a mysterious video tape that people watch and then die 7 days later, is investigated by Rachel (Watts)when she investigates the mysterious death of a teenage relative of hers.  There are a couple of 'fright scenes' but the majority of the movie revolves around the investigation into the mystery of the tape.  People in the movie (and the audiance) do see video, which sets us up for a 7 day deadline to get to the bottom of the tape, and try and solve the mystery to put an end to the curse.  I found the mystery and the investigation to be interesting, and helped set a dramatic tension in the movie with the race against time.  Top notch thriller that I think will have a wide audiance appeal.",8,0,0,27 October 2002
Minority Report," Good movie... but definitely not great
","I think with such a high tech, futuristic movie there is a tendency to really look for the flaws.  I'm not a big fan of this genre for that very reason.  I wasn't particularly impressed with the Matrix, because I found the plot so hard to believe.  This movie has the same problem.  It seems that some future advancements are actually a step backwards.   But, kind of ignoring some the `futuristic' aspects of the movie, there are a few good actions sequences, and the plot held my interest as it turned into a murder mystery with a couple of twits in it.SPOILER ALERT  You can't go any where without having your eyes scanned and being recognized for who you are.  That seems reasonable enough for 50 years in the future. But, on the black market you can have new eyes put in, and now you can suddenly walk around with a completely new identity.  And the same technology the mall and subway uses to recognize you by an eye scan is apparently the same technology that the most secure installations in the world use.  I might have guessed that secure installations would have thrown in a backup thumb print scan or something But, I decided to look past those technological issues, and I found something that bothered me more about the plot.  The `pre-cogs', those beings that could see the future, were described as being perfect predictors of the future.  The visions that they see are the future.  However, we see 4 events of their pre-cognitive ability.  The opening scene, where we don't know for sure what would have happened, the murder that Tom Cruise's character commits, which we find out he doesn't commit, Tom Cruise's murder, which doesn't happen, and the murder of the pre-cogs mom, which was dismissed as an echo.  So, 4 alerted murders 2 which the killers didn't go through with it 1 which was mis-read by the tech and 1 which we don't know the disposition.   Seems like a system which had huge flaws.  How did it ever survive testing?  Seems like the system wouldn't have really survived to the point of about to go national.",7,0,0,1 July 2002
Memento," skcuS
","You see the ending, and then have to wade through the rest of the movie, as it is told in scenes that are presented in reverse order, to see if the ending was a good thing, or a bad thing.  I had that figured out as the opening credits were rolling.  I didn't find the story at all interesting, I knew how it ended, it was just a matter of seeing how we got there... it didn't work for me.Also, I found the guys affliction very odd.  I've never heard of such an extreme memory problem.  I also kept asking myself if a person with this problem could function well enough to leave himself notes, and to tatoo himself with notes, and go on this quest, would he be going around with no one to help him a little... he knows that eventually he will be lost again, except for his notes.  I didn't buy it.  Too odd... too silly.",3,5,8,22 August 2002
Insomnia," Enjoyable, but how about some aluminum foil for the window?
","This is a solid murder mystery, with some great acting performances. Dormer(Pacino), a Los Angles detective comes to Alaska to help out on a murder in Alaska.  He brings a partner, Hap, with him.  In Alaska, a new police officer, Ellie Burr (Swank) is a fan of Dormer's and has studied his work in 'the academy'.  At first the movie seems to be a straight forward 'who doneit', but a couple of twists spring up.  Dormer and his partner are having a conflict about an on going internal affairs problem back in Los Angles. It is apparent the pair have something to hide. Dormer has trouble sleeping in the land of the midnight sun, and his physical condition worsens through out the movie.  Dormer is clearly a superiour detective, but his problems back in Los Angeles, crept up to affect his police work on this case.  There are some twists in the plot that are clever, and make the movie fun to watch. Although, I had the ending pretty well figured out well in advance.  A few things test believability...** spoilers follow **One being that Finch (Williams) seems to be able to just evade bullets and police, but simply turning and running.  Viola... he is gone.One of the major plot premises, is that Dormer can't sleep, because up in the part of Alaska they are in the sun never sets, so his bedroom always has the sun shining in.  I kept thinking that if I was really in need of a dark room, I could figure out a way to black out the window.  Also, Ellie, the local rookie cop in Alaska, just happened to be a big fan of Dormer's. In fact she did a case study on him at the academy.  I'm not sure I really bought the likely hood of a local cop in Alaska doing case studies on Los Angeles cops.  And then having them show up to solve a crime in your little town.  But, the most significant twist in the plot involves the killer, witnessing Dormer doing something in which Dormer is trying to hide. This is kind of a clever concept, the policeman being blackmailed by the person he is trying to arrest.  But, I didn't really buy the scenerio that got Dormer into trouble.  They have the killer trapped, but he practically disappears into a fog so thick you can't see anything... except the killer apparently can see everything.  Oh well... if you can over look that, you should enjoy the movie.",7,0,0,23 October 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Was it supposed to end that way, or did the film break?
","** spoilers ahead **I'm not a huge fan of fantasy science fiction.  I didn't read the trilogy of books, and went to see the movie with out too many expectations of what it was about.The movie starts out with top notch special effects, great sets and beautiful scenes.  The story is intriguing and I was intrested in the mystery surrounding the ring.  But, when the quest starts I found the movie bogged down significantly.  I became dis-interested in some of the little side stories from their quest.  Knowing that there are two more movies to come, I didn't think the little hobbits were in too much danger on their quest.  I sure could have used a fast forward button in the theater.  I wouldn't have had any problem knocking 45 minutes out of the movie.The ending left me felling cheated and betrayed.  The film just ends, practically in mid-conversation.  I thought maybe the film had broken.  What is the point of a movie with no ending.  I'm going to skip watching the second one.  And if the 3rd one is any good... I might go and watch the second one later...",6,0,0,7 August 2002
American Beauty," I just don't get it.
","I think I have never been so at odds with the 'mainstream' on any movie as I have been on this one.  I didn't find this movie entertaining at all, and I didn't find it insightful, or revealing of American suburbia.   Virtually every character in the movie is grossly dysfunctional to a comical degree. Perhaps the most being the wife of the neighbor.  She is comically catatonic, and unresponsive to her surroundings, and her husband doesn't seem to notice, or care.  The Kevin Spacey character is nearly completely estranged from his wife and daughter, but doesn't really seem to be all that concerned about either as he pursues a relationship with his daughter's friend, and smokes pot, and works fast food as his wife cheats on him. His daughter seems to appreciate the attention of the neighbor.  Anyone else would have been treating him as a stalker, and getting a restraining order against him.  And the young man (who sees beauty in everything), seems to have a rather elaborate and open drug selling business out of the home, that seemed comical given his relationship with his tyrant father.I didn't identify with any character in the move, I don't know any one like any character in the movie, I don't think a bag blowing in the wind is beautiful, and I just didn't get it.",4,1,2,6 May 2002
Apocalypse Now," Thank goodness for the fast forward button on the remote
","This movie has many powerful scenes.  It deserves it's status as an American film classic.  However, I found the redux version way too long.  I felt some of the restored scenes in the movie took away from the flow.  Especially out of place was the scene where they arrive at the French plantation.  I think the picture does a good job of conveying the hopelessness and confusion that probably existed in the battlefield.  Duval's character was my favorite of the film.  His character's willingness to attack a difficult target was more inspired by his desire to surf on the beach than to accomplish a military goal.  I think that conveyed a sense of the way that some military decisions were made.  However, I didn't buy the Kurtz character.  I thought Brando's acting was great, but the situation of him forming his own little army to fight the war was too outlandish.  Oh well, certainly a classic, I think I'll take the original over the Redux, and I think I would have prefered a more believable conclusion.",7,0,2,16 July 2002
Spider-Man," A lot of fun
","A great adaptation of a comic book for the big screen.  The movie gives you a feel for Peter Parker's awkwardness as a teen, and the transformation he makes to become Spiderman.  The love story between Parker/Spiderman and M.J. will remind you of the relationship between Superman and Lois Lane.  Where you the viewer are in on the secret, and kind of hoping that M.J can figure it out.  The special effects were mostly great.  But, some of the scenes of Spiderman flying through the streets on his web looked a little fake.  But, did remind me a great deal of the animation from the comic books.I think fans of comic book style action adventure will find the movie to be a lot fun.I thought all of the acting performances were great.  Particularly, Defoe was memorable in a difficult role of the nice guy/ruthless business man, transforming into the arch villain.",8,1,2,3 November 2002
K-19: The Widowmaker," Solid, entertaining.
","I was kind of expecting a version of Crimson Tide from a Russian point of view, and it almost was.This film starts off by setting up a conflict between the Captain, and first officer.  Polenin (Neeson) is the designated captain of a sub that Russia wants to put to sea well before it is ready.  Polenin is concerened with his men on the boat.  The higher ups, not nearly so concerned with people, put Vostrikov (Ford) in charge of the sub to make sure the mission is carried out regardless of the risk.  Of course there is conflict between Polenin and Vostrikov.  The submarine begins to experience some significant malfunctions.  I found the movie suspenseful, and the conclusion entertaining.",6,1,2,17 December 2002
Men in Black II," Watch the orginal again, instead of this.
","After watching MIIB, I had the feeling that the film makers thought that the orginal movie was so successful because of the special effects.  So, when making a sequel, they should just put in more special effects;  And they did.  If you thought the 'weird aliens' were funny in the first, there are more here.  If you thought a talking dog was funny in the first, lots more of him here.  If you liked the car that is part spaceship, lots more of it here.  If you thought the alien getting his head shot off and it growing back was fun, it happens about 5 more times here.  Of course while putting in all the extra fun stuff, a few minor things like the the characters and the plot had to be squeezed out.The first movie developed a little background Smith's and Jones' characters, and let you sense a bond between them.  No time for that here.  They were mostly just typical buddy cop characters.  Setting out to save the world, always a 1/2 step ahead of the villains. There are a couple of clever jokes, a chuckle here and there, but there was too few for the humor to save the movie, and there was too little development of the characters or the plot for me to be concerned about resolution of the story.",4,0,1,6 December 2002
Mulholland Drive," Like spilling paint on the floor and hoping it turns into a painting.
","It could be interpreted any number of different ways.  But, what is clear, the story is jumbled, characters change name, situations are repeated with different people.  Two stories mixed together?  Two variations on the same story?  Who cares?  For me it was a pointless.  I've noticed a number of the reviews of people that liked it seem to suggest that the movie needs to be studied and reviewed so that you can really 'get it'.  That there really is a masterpiece in there somewhere.  I would suggest to them, that if you spill paint on the floor and stare at it long enough, you may actually see a face after a while, but you are still looking at a mess, not a painting.  On the upside, Naomi Watts was great.  Her performance was believable despite whatever character she was playing or situation she was in.",3,1,5,21 August 2002
8 Mile," Not much there.
","I will qualify my review by saying I'm in my 40's, lived in the suburbs my whole life, and I tend to avoid rap music.  However, I have heard a few Eminem songs that I like, and I had heard the movie wasn't really featuring a lot of rap music.  So, I had an expectation of a movie about a guy using his talent to pursue his music career.  And, that is kind of what the movie was about... kind of.  The movie certainly portrays people in dire circumstances.  They drive cars that barely run.  they live in places that are barely inhabitable.  I don't know how realistic it is, but it is certainly gritty.  'Bunny' (Eminem) is seeking a better life through his music career.  He has an interesting band of friends that all seem close, and supportive.  One character was impossibly dim-witted.  But, the others came across as decent people, with distinct personalities and life goals.  They are are depending on Bunny to be a big hit as a rapper.  The acting was varied.  I thought Eminem was a little wooden, he would go from very kind and sensitive, to quite hostile and violent with not too much in between.  His gang of friends were all good, with Mekhi Phifer's character being the most interesting.  Brittany Murphy's character Alex seemed kind of out of place.  I'm not sure that the 'love interest' really did much for the story.  The rival 'rap gang', were kind of one dimensional also, but they weren't given a lot to do.  As Bunny pursues his rap career we see a dismal failure early in the movie when he 'chokes' and has to walk off stage.  He seems to now have a stage fright, and he is determined to purse a rap career, without rapping in public.  It would seem like there would be a chance for a big climatic conclusion in the movie with with him making a triumphant return to the stage, and winning over the crowd... *** spoilers follow ***This does kind of happen.  However, the big rap contest at the end turns out to be a 'rapping out insults' contest.  So, rather than get Eminim's big smash hit song for the movie, you get a couple of episodes of him insulting people better than they insulted him.  With each witty zinger, the crowd ooo's and aaah's its approval.  But, while mildly entertaining, it wasn't as much fun as listening to one of his real songs, and the conclusion was no more dramatic than the ending of Sly Stalone's 'Over the Top' movie where he tried to make arm wrestling even less interesting than it already is.  The conclusion wasn't particularly satisfying for me.  The story was a little slow with out too much really happening.",5,0,1,17 November 2002
From Hell," Suspense and Horror from Jack the Ripper
","The movie is a violent, suspenseful retelling of the Jack the Ripper killings.  The acting is good, and the story is told as a murder mystery where you as viewer get to attempt to solve the crimes along with Fred Abberline (Depp).  The story has a few new twists in that Fred seems to be something of a psychic, who gets some of his clues from drug induced visions.  Also, all of the victims are acquaintances, who seem to have something in common with their pasts.  The movie does have some clues that you can pick up along the way where you may actually be able to make some guesses as to who the killer really is.The movie is quite gorey in a few scenes.  There is a enough mystery and suspense to keep you guessing until the end.",6,1,2,29 December 2002
Halloween," 'Don't Open That Door'
","In some ways Halloween deserves some blame for starting the 'slasher' horror movie genre'.  However, I personally don't consider this movie a 'slasher' film.  There is a monster on the loose, and there is a body count.  But, the movie is suspenseful, with several scenes that will have you peeking through your fingers at the screen.",8,0,0,31 October 2002
Amélie," Very satisfying
","I watched this movie on DVD, and really enjoyed it.  Amelie, the main character in the film, is painfully shy and introverted.  However, upon feeling the satisfaction of doing a good deed for a stranger she sets out to do more good deeds for others.  There is some great subtle humor, but not any real belly laughs.  Likewise, there are some sentimental moments, but nothing to really draw tears.  The version I saw was in French with English sub-titles.  I found this a little distracting.  The film also uses some interesting techniques to convey the feelings and thoughts of the actors. The characters in the film have kind of sparse dialog, there is a voice-over to fill in the gaps, but the film has many short 'dream like' or surreal scenes that fill in the characters thoughts and emotions.  For example in one scene when Amelie comes face to face with a man she has a crush on, as she walks away, she actually turns into a puddle of water and splashs on the floor, kind of Alley McBeal style.  Sometimes there are little dreams played out briefly just in a corner of the screen.  I found this unique for a film, and thought they added conveying the emotion of the characters in the film. The film has a different look, style, pace to it from movies I'm used to seeing.  Maybe because it is French, or maybe just because it is a different kind of film.  This unique look is something that I enjoyed about the movie. I found a couple of spots where the story seemed a bit slow, but all in all, I found it to be really entertaining, and left me feeling quite satisfied.",9,0,1,26 July 2002
Windtalkers," Not about the 'Windtalkers'
","The movie advertises itself to be about Native American Navahos using their Navaho language as an unbreakable code in WWII.  However, I didn't find the movie to be about that at all.  There were a couple of 'Windtalker' characters in the movie.  But, they were just there as a plot point to give give Cage the excuse to have a mission of protecting the code... not the person, but the code.  That means he can't let the 'Windtalkers' fall into enemy hands at any cost.  So, naturally, they immediately run the 'Windtalkers' to the front lines where they run randomly around in circles while Cage follows along with a machine gun mowing down dozens of enemy soldiers at a time.  And since they really want to protect the code, they do things like putting one of them in a Japanese uniform so he can walk right into the enemy camp... Of course cage goes along.  Machine guns blaze, and Rambo, er rather Cage, racks up huge body counts mostly in slow motion. There is a tremendous amount of close up fighting.  Lots of hand to hand combat, lots of hand gernades... and none of it seemed realistic to me. Apparently both the Japanese and US armies believed in having a few soldiers constantly yelling and running out into the open where they could be shot easily.Did the US army really use the windtalkers on the front lines to give coordinates for artillery?  Once they sent in the coordinates the shelling started almost immediately, what difference would it have made if they gave the coordinates in English?  Maybe this is historically accurate, but I have a feeling the 'windtalkers' were probably used more to coordinate the date of attacks, help coordinate meeting points, and probably not on the front lines fighting hand to hand.  I found the movie unrealistic, unentertaining, and unwatchable.",4,1,1,20 January 2003
