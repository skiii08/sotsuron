The Blair Witch Project," Horrible
","The success of this movie was one of the big mysteries in my life.What really surprises me is that there are people who, even when getting clearly disappointed after watching it, try to see in its bad technical quality a sort of reason to appreciate it.The technical means used were certainly poor but how can this be possibly considered a good point? Moreover, there is a clear lack of ideas. The plot and the scenes that are supposed to be scary are ridiculous and banal. It's not really the fact of being home-made. There are home-made movies far better than this and with a lot more of ideas.The only explanation of its commercial success is, in my opinion, the huge advertising campaign and the smart abuse of the 'urban legend' voices that the authors their-selves spread around.",2,1,4,19 August 2007
