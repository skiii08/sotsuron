The King's Speech," The King's Speech was inspirational for many
","'The King's Speech' is a great portrayal of the problems that King George VI had with his stammer. Colin Firth, who plays 'Bertie' in this film, has been stammering ever since he can remember. He goes to get treated by Lionel Logue, an Australian speech therapist, played by Geoffrey Rush. Together, the both of them journey as they work together in order for Bertie to improve on his speech and gain an unexpected and long-lasting friendship.I liked this movie because I could relate to Bertie and his problem. Though I don't have a stammer, I am quite terrified of talking in public, so I found that I could easily relate to Bertie's hazardous breathing, his hectic eyes roaming the crowds and his numerous pauses when talking. If I could relate to it, I'm sure there are many others who did the same. This movie really was an inspiration.Though not all facts were 100% accurate, it doesn't do anything to harm this movie's reputation. Plus, most details are less than noticeable, so it won't take away anything from the movie. Unless, of course, you're a historical buff who is particular when it comes to such things. But if you're like me, who has very little knowledge about the life of King George VI, you might enjoy this one as much as I did.Viewed on: May 6, 2011",8,0,0,5 May 2011
The Mask," Smoking!
","I enjoyed this film! That's saying a lot since I never liked the animated series which I grew up with. I just found it too weird and too crazy. But it works in this one. Especially with Jim Carrey as the lead role. I've noticed that Jim Carrey always gets the goofy and crazy roles. It was actually weird seeing him as a sane and normal bank clerk during the beginning of the movie. Regardless, I love Jim Carrey. He's a great actor.This was a pretty good film, considering I don't usually like crazy. The actors were great if you take into account that they're acting in a slapstick sort of comedy. It reminded me of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, actually. Though, I did like this one more. I also thought that the special effects were great for the 90's. Or maybe that's just me.In The Mask, Jim Carrey plays an average bank clerk who one day stumbles upon a mask which allows him to let loose and become crazy. His antics are hilarious and crazy and it's just plain funny. You're sure to laugh with this one!",7,1,1,14 February 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Less Edward/Bella scenes, more werewolves scenes and this movie would have been all set!
","'The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1' is the fourth movie in the series. Edward and Bella get married and soon, Bella is pregnant. The problem is that the child within her is no ordinary fetus. It is deadly and it is killing her from the inside. Literally.I actually liked the movie. Apart from the all-too-cheesy Edward and Bella scenes, of course. I just wanted to share that I found myself literally giggling at two parts because of its cheesiness. But I did like this movie because of the werewolves- particularly Jacob Black. Jacob added drama and spice to the movie. I was just sorry that the movie didn't feature that much of him. In the book, there were chapters written in Jacob's point of view. I enjoyed those a lot. The werewolves scenes in this movie didn't do the book justice. I wanted more of Jacob. And NOT just because of Taylor Lautner.This movie basically just revolved around Edward and Bella's unborn child. The movie felt short. I didn't see the need to split 'Breaking Dawn' into two separate movies. This movie felt more like an 'opening' or a 'teaser', rather than an actual movie. The events here could have been summed up in a few sentences. They should have included the action scenes. I was really looking forward to it. Oh well.Don't judge this movie too much because of its reputation. Give it a try. It is interesting, for what it's worth. A must see for fans of the series.",6,7,15,19 November 2011
Source Code," A fantastic thriller movie
","I first learned about Source Code thanks to IMDb. I saw Jake Gyllenhaal was starring in the film, so I decided to check out the trailer. It was brilliant. The trailer made me excited to see the actual movie and I was very disappointed (when I first saw the trailer) to find out that 'Source Code' wasn't out yet.We were originally going to see 'Sucker Punch' today, but it wasn't showing during the times we were available. Luckily, I saw that this movie was also playing, so I eagerly suggested to watch this movie instead. It was a good choice, seeing as my mom, my sister and I all enjoyed this movie tremendously.This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat, waiting for Colter (Jake Gyllenhaal) to make his next move. I was surprised to see that this was sort of a low-budget movie. The director did a great job with limited funding. 'Source Code' will keep everyone interested. Unless you're that type of person who over-analyzes everything and wants everything to be perfect.As an action movie, this film gets a perfect grade. As a thriller, another perfect grade. But I was confused with the science-fiction part of this movie. The ending made me confused. I didn't know what had happened anymore. I think that this movie should have ended 5 minutes earlier. But it didn't. And for that, I gave this movie a 9/10. A very small (and can be overlooked if you wish to) deduction.'Source Code' is an excellent mystery thriller. Don't over think things. Just enjoy it. This is truly a great movie. I will be looking forward for more works of Duncan Jones.Viewed on: April 4, 2011",9,2,5,4 April 2011
Kung Fu Panda," The big, fat panda kicks butt!
","This film has got to be one of Dreamworks best ones! The animation is great, the music really fits in with the movie's mood and the humor is excellent!Po is a Panda whose dream is to fight along side the legendary Furious Five. Only he can't do that because he's stuck selling noodles in his dad's noodle shop and on top of that, he has absolutely no knowledge of martial arts, whatsoever. One day, a flyer is sent out stating that the Dragon Warrior will be chosen from the Furious Five. Po, along with everyone in the town, is excited and goes off to see who'll be crowned the Dragon Warrior. However, due to some circumstances, instead of one of the Furious Five being crowned the Dragon Warrior, Po finds himself being chosen! Now Master Shifu finds himself having to train a big, fat panda who knows nothing about kung fu. He has no choice, though, since Tai Lung, a known criminal, is heading their way.The plot itself seems like it's nothing special- an outcast being chosen to do a professional's job. But the way this movie was presented was just great. The humor really blends in with the movie and makes it just really fun to watch. The humor is what makes this movie stick out. It isn't just your usual animal slapstick comedy. It's really more than that. On top of that, the fight scenes were quite awesome, if I do say so myself. I hope 'Kung Fu Panda 2' lives up to the expectations of the many fans of this awesome first film!Viewed on: April 12, 2011",9,1,1,12 April 2011
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Not THAT funny as everyone makes it out to be
","I've never watched a single episode of South Park, so the reason why I decided to watch this movie was because it was on the top 50 animated films of Rotten Tomatoes. I've seen South Park here and there back when I was about 10 or 11, but never watched it since I understood that its humor is usually obscene and was targeted for adults. I thought, while deciding whether to watch it or not, that I've matured enough to give this movie a try. Damn. Do I regret it.First of all, let me state that I'm not a prude. I curse almost everyday. I am trying to put a stop to it, though. But, wow, was I surprised at the amount of swear words this movie had! Even if the first 10 minutes! I don't know if all South Park episodes are like this movie, filled with much profanity, but gosh. I don't think I'm going to be watching the TV series any time soon.Let me also say that I was very disturbed with the images of Saddam Hussein and Satan. I thought it was offensive to Saddam, too. I am impressed with the openness this 1999 animated film had with homosexuality, though. I'll give it that.I did enjoy some of the songs. For example, that rehabilitation song that Mr. Mackey taught the kids was funny and kind of inspired me! AAAAAAND, that's about the only song I remembered.Overall, this wasn't really a funny film. It was funny during the first 20 minutes, with everyone freaking out because of the corrupting of the youth and the children experimenting with 'new words', but then it just began repeating itself. Imagine Friend A throwing a pie at Friend B's face, unexpectedly. Funny, right? Now imagine Friend A throwing his 3654th pie at Friend B's face. Not so funny anymore, right? And I'll bet Friend B just wants to kick the crap out of Friend A now. This movie is just like that.This film isn't for everyone. I thought that it would appeal to me, but it didn't. I guess this one's for South Park fans and people who enjoy crude humor.",2,0,6,26 February 2011
Ice Age: The Meltdown," A worth sequel to 'Ice Age'!
","The Ice Age is coming to an end and all the animals journey together to find a safer place. Manny the woolly mammoth, Sid the sloth, and Diego the saber-toothed tiger join all the animals as they retreat to higher ground. On their trip, they discover that Manny may not be the last woolly mammoth left on Earth.Most sequels fail. I thought that this movie wouldn't interest me as the original one did. I had low expectations for this movie, to be honest. However 'Ice Age: The Meltdown' showed me how wrong I was.I found the new additions to the cast fun, and not at all annoying. Ellie, another woolly mammoth and Crash and Eddie, two possum brothers, gave me a lot of laughs. I liked Ellie's story line. I found it entertaining. Crash and Eddie may have acted like two brats, but it was amusing.I found this movie funny, fresh and unique. I found many lines hilarious, although I may not have laughed out loud. I know that I laughed a lot more when I was younger. It's sad that I can't enjoy this film as much as I did when I was a kid. With that being said, I can say that I know that kids will really enjoy this movie.",7,0,0,5 November 2011
127 Hours," They didn't have to turn Aron Ralston's story into a 94 min. movie
","James Franco plays Aron Ralston, a man who enjoys mountain climbing. '127 Hours' follows Aron as he prepares for a great hike out in the Grand Canyon. He's confident in his abilities, with good reason, so he doesn't bother telling anyone where he's off to. Yet, even an experienced hiker, who has his head packed full of survival knowledge, can't prepare for everything.I was excited to watch this, given all of the hype. But after watching it, I can say that whatever I was expecting in this movie, just wasn't there. The movie was tedious. The first 20 minutes were all right. I enjoyed Aron's bonding time with the 2 girls and I was quite shocked and surprised after seeing the boulder fall down and crush his arm. We then see Aron pushing the rock, grunting, crying, drinking water, filming, etc. That was literally all the happened throughout the entire middle portion of the film. It got repetitive and boring! Though I admit, it makes me wonder why I just didn't stop watching. Maybe I was curious to see how it all ended.This film could have been better if the movie was shorter or if they spent some time building Aron's character. What we saw on film (from the flashbacks) was just a man who loved adventure and liked being by himself that he didn't bother telling anyone where he was heading off to. That's all I got from the flashbacks.I admit, Aron's triumph was no easy feat. I'm sure I would have given up, if I was in that position. So, congratulations to Aron! But really, they didn't have to make it into a full-length movie. Tedious and repetitive, really.Viewed on: May 5, 2011",3,5,8,4 May 2011
Home Alone," Great if you have company
","'Home Alone' is about a young boy,Kevin McCallister, who gets left behind in his house accidentally. When his family realizes this, it is already too late, seeing as they already took the plane and are thousands of miles away from home. But despite that, they still try all that they can do to get home and contact Kevin. Meanwhile, back in Kevin's neighborhood, there has been reports of ongoing robberies. Kevin, with his many tricks and fast wit, does his best to protect his home from the burglars.The movie is a bit unrealistic, but the again, there wouldn't be any movies if nothing out-of-the-ordinary ever happened. To enjoy this movie, it is best if viewers don't over-think about what happened and just sit back and take in Kevin's crazy antics.I admit that I began getting bored when it was the climax of the film. I felt like the humor was very cheap and it wasn't at all engaging. I did however like the message and the heartwarming feeling that I felt during the ending.For me, this was a mediocre film. I'm sure I would have liked this film more if I had company. This film may have many people saying it's very hilarious, but I found that I only really laughed about twice. Maybe if I had company, I would have appreciated this film more. I'll keep that in mind when December 2011 comes around.Viewed on: April 5, 2011",6,0,0,5 April 2011
The Adventures of Tintin," It made me want to read the comic books
","Tintin is a reporter who has unexpectedly gotten involved in a mystery concerning a ship. He sets out on a journey to find hidden treasure with Captain Haddock. However, there is also someone dangerous after the same prize.I know who Tintin is. I may not have grown up with him, but I am familiar with his comic books. I only knew very few details about Tintin, so it wouldn't be right to call me a fan. However, I was still excited to watch this movie, when I learned that there would be a movie adaptation of the famous Tintin.I liked this film a whole lot! I like stories that have mystery and sleuthing in them. That's why I'm fans of Detective Conan and Nancy Drew! After watching this film, I also got very interested in Tintin! Aside from the mystery parts in this movie, there were also many humorous moments. There were many parts where the audience was literally laughing out loud. It's that good!Have I mentioned that this film is absolutely beautiful? Everything looked great.. I almost want to watch it again just so I could marvel at the beautiful graphics. The action scenes were very intense, too. Mad props to the director and writers.Watching this film has made me want to try reading the Tintin comics. I can't wait. This is a great film for everyone to watch! I, who didn't know too much about Tintin, really enjoyed this one!Viewed on: November 30, 2011",7,2,6,30 November 2011
Tangled," A new Disney princess!
","And a kick-ass one, at that! Tangled is the modern version of the old fairytale classic- Rapunzel. I've forgotten what the original version of Rapunzel was, but I know that it certainly wasn't this one. Disney did a good job in making this movie. They added the plot with the hair and I loved the whole thing with the lanterns! A big plus was that all the songs were catchy! None which I can see as classics, though like 'A Whole New World' or 'Colors of the Wind' or etc. But they were still good. Good enough for me to want to have that album.The plot wasn't exactly A+. It was average. Not that I'm complaining since this movie's target audience ARE for the kids. I didn't hate that evil witch, by the way. I thought she did a pretty good job. I mean, she was willing to go and trek 3 days for paint that Rapunzel wanted? Most evil stepmothers wouldn't do that! (Certainly not like that bitch in Cinderella, OOPS.) But not this woman. She showed that she cared. That's why I wasn't really hoping that she would die. Halfway throughout the movie, I was even thinking of ways on how this movie could end happily, without the witch dying. 'Maybe Rapunzel's real family will let the witch work somewhere in the castle and Rapunzel would sing for her weekly!' Hey! It seemed like a good idea to me!The humor was indeed funny. I think both adults and children would enjoy it. I loved Maximus! Max's relationship with Eugene sort of reminded me of Shrek and Donkey. I liked Maximus more, though, since he wasn't annoying. It was a good call for Disney to NOT make the animals talk this time. That gets annoying.I also liked the big hair change Rapunzel had. This movie proves that hair can really do a lot to a person. With her long blonde hair and gorgeous green eyes, Rapunzel looked like a child with no knowledge of anything. She was a child. But after her hair was cut, she looked like a new person! She looked more mature and a lot more edgy. Eugene did a good job. I teared up in the ending. What can I say? I'm a sucker for family scenes.This was a great movie. It isn't showing in the Philippines yet, but I think I'll still watch it when it hits theaters next week, even if I already got to watch it. :) Good job, Disney!1st viewing: January 29, 2011 ; 2nd viewing: February 5, 2011",8,4,6,29 January 2011
Corpse Bride," Only appeals to certain people
","I had a weird craving for this movie one night. I didn't know why, but I did. That's what led to me deciding to watch it. At first, I found it okay. With all the singing and the gloomy colors and etc. But after Emily brought Victor down to their world, I lost interest. I stopped watching. It seemed boring to me.I didn't watch it for several days (2? 3?) until tonight. I forced myself to go through the remaining scenes and I found that I could actually tolerate it. It wasn't captivating, but it was adequate enough. Okay entertainment for a night.I found this movie dull, bland and boring. I always thought Tim Burton was a genius, but after re-watching this, I found that I didn't really like his style. I understand the appeal his movies have to certain audiences, but it wasn't to my liking at all. Sorry.However, to be fair, I did like the piano scene between Emily and Victor and all the other songs, though. Except for that creepy one when the underworld is first introduced.If you're one of those people who likes not-your-ordinary-love-story animation movies, you could give this a try. Maybe. I guess.",4,0,2,20 January 2011
Forrest Gump," The world from a different viewpoint
","I watched this a very long time ago, but I never really appreciated this movie. It must have been because I was very young. I wasn't even born when the movie first aired! However, I do remember a few scenes from this movie. The ones that stuck with me throughout the years were the very, very sad scene of Bubba dying and the oh-so-famous quote: 'Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.' This movie starts with a feather floating in the background, getting flown all over in the place, when finally it lands beside some dirty rubber shoes. The owner of these shoes, Forrest Gump, picks it up and keeps it. He just sits there, quietly all by himself, when a woman sits beside him on his bench. He then greets her and thus, begins the narration of his life story.His story is wonderful. I loved everything about it. Forrest wasn't exactly the brightest crayon in the box. On top of that, he couldn't even walk properly. His IQ was a poor 75 and he couldn't even get accepted into a public school. But his mother did everything for Forrest. His mother was great. You could see she struggling.I thought it was very cute the way Jenny and Forrest's friendship blossomed. How she invited him to sit beside her. The way they hung around with each other in their tree and just talked about anything and everything. Jenny was very protective of Forrest. When the first bullying encounter happened and Jenny told Forrest to run? That made my skin have goosebumps. It just felt good. 'Run, Forrest! Run!' I also never realized back then that Jenny was having trouble with her father. But now, I understand. Jenny's prayer was also.. Amazing. 'Dear God, make me a bird. So I could fly far. Far far away from here.' That just touched me.After his friendship with Jenny, Forrest met Bubba during the Vietnam War, after he finished college. During the scene where Forrest first entered the bus, it was like the first day of school all over again! Nobody would let Forrest sit with him. Until he came upon a guy who had a weird lip jutting out. That was the start of their strong brotherhood.I felt like the time they spent together was so short. I didn't even cry when Bubba died. It was weird since I was expecting to cry, seeing as how Bubba's scene was the one that stayed with me all throughout the years. I'm so disappointed in my lack of emotional attachment. But I still love Bubba. :) It was nice how Forrest went on with his shrimp catching business just for the sake of keeping his promise to Bubba.The two things that changed during my previous screenings and the one I had tonight were 1.) I liked Lt. Dan more than I thought I would and 2.) Jenny wasn't all that great.I'll talk about Lt. Dan first. First of all, I didn't even remember him! I was even shocked when I saw that his legs were cut off! See how much that 'didn't' affect me. But he was a good friend. He became one of Forrest's best friends. He even stood up for him when one of the hookers called Forrest stupid. I thought Dan didn't care, but that proved me wrong. They even became partners with the whole Bubba-Gump thing. Sweet.Now, about Jenny. I don't see why Forrest liked her. Yes, I get that they were friends since childhood, but after they grew out of their childhood, she kept leaving him! I was so mad after she left him during 'the morning after'. At least that sparked Forrest's will to run all over America. Hm.The ending was great. I forgot all about that. What a welcome surprise. It's just a shame that Jenny died, too, in the end. All of Forrest's loved ones passed away. All he's got left is Little Forrest. I guess in a way, that was nice. He had someone to look after and someone to look after him. :) There were a lot of great cameos that I was on a look out for. I loved that Elvis part! I even took a second look to check if that guy was really Elvis! Yes. I know. It's impossible since he's already dead, but hey! It seemed realistic. There were also meetings with different presidents. And a deal he had with a very famous 'fruit company'. The cameos just kept coming and coming. And it worked! The main message of this movie was that life just keeps on going. Bad things are inevitable, but you can trust that there will be a million good things that will come your way. It's a movie about life. Forrest Gump teaches you things. He sees the world from a different viewpoint. Not an idiot's viewpoint. But a child-like sort-of perspective. No biases at all. Just an average things-the-way-they-actually-are perspective. This is one movie you mustn't dare miss. Wonderful movie. Just wonderful.",10,4,7,29 January 2011
Bridget Jones's Diary," Bridget Jones: The Awkward 33-Year-Old
","Bridget Jones is a crazy woman. She's in her early 30's and single. However she's full of hope and she managed to get her boss, Daniel Cleaver, interested in her by a skirt (or lack of it) she wore to work one day. I think their relationship was too rushed and too full of sex. It's no surprise it didn't work out. After detaching herself from Daniel, she's hit on by Mark Darcy, one of her childhood acquaintances. Apparently, she fell in love with Mr. Darcy after he said that he liked Bridget 'just the way she was'.The movie is subtly implying that women can't live without men- a woman is nothing without a man. Bridget should learn to stand up for herself. Even when single, she's already mentally and emotionally unstable, with her drinking and smoking problem! So how can she survive a relationship? Then again, this comes from a teenager who's been single since birth, so you can feel free to disregard that.Despite the subliminal messages, this movie was okay. I couldn't see Shirley Henderson as anyone other than Moaning Myrtle in the Harry Potter series. I had to pause in the beginning of the movie, when I heard her moaning/complaining to Bridget. Anyway, this movie was not Colin Firth's best movie. And DEFINITELY not Hugh Grant's best one. However, Renée Zellweger was perfect for this role. Even though I haven't read the books (but I am planning to!), Renée just seems like a Bridget Jones! Her English accent wasn't that bad, either.I was turned off by Bridget's alcohol and smoking problem, but her awkwardness and silliness made her lovable and easy to relate with. When I first watched this movie at a young age, I remember rooting for Daniel, simply because I was in love with Hugh Grant. And every time the ending came on, with Bridget in her underwear, kissing Mark Darky.. Yeech. I always thought, 'Why would she pick him when she could have Grant?!' But watching it now, I realize that Mark was the better choice (and he might even be as sexy as Grant is).",6,0,2,2 January 2011
10 Things I Hate About You," 10 stars for this movie!
","This is an EXCELLENT movie. Sure, the plot wasn't the most original one. It was cliché, but for some reason, I still loved it! I mean, the way the movie was executed was just great. All the actors did a wonderful job. They all had great chemistry which made the movie very enjoyable. I found myself interested in both sisters' romances. I wasn't only rooting for Patrick and Kat. I found myself also rooting for Cameron and Bianca.Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles had SO MUCH chemistry. I absolutely loved them together. They were very sweet with each other, but they were still very real. If I could pick out one of my favorite scenes to talk about, I'd talk about the date that they had. I loved their paintball date! I thought that it wasn't too formal or stuffy. It was just plain and simple, but still very fun. During this scene, it was like they weren't even acting. They were just having fun with it! That was great because this IS a rom-com movies for teens and in this scene, they were just that. Teenagers having fun.When I was younger, I watched this movie, but never really understood it. As I grew older, I remember wanting to rewatch this movie again, but I couldn't remember the title. I felt very frustrated with myself. But I did remember one particular scene, though. (SPOILERS:) That one scene where Patrick serenades Kat out in the field. (/SPOILERS) Thanks to that scene and with the help of YouTube, I managed to figure out what the name of this movie was. This very well proves that this movie is a classic. Almost 12 years has passed since the release of this movie, but no one has forgotten that epic and heartwarming scene (SPOILERS:) where Patrick just forgets about everything puts himself out there for Kat. (/SPOILERS) While watching that scene, I had this huge smile on my face the whole time. I'm sure that I'm not the only one who felt that way. And YouTube can prove that with their many videos of this particular scene- one video with almost 7 million views!I really don't know what else to say about this movie, except that it's great. It is truly an excellent movie that I doubt there's really anyone else in this world who hasn't watched it yet. If you're part of the minority who hasn't watched this movie yet, there's just one thing I want to ask you: 'What are you waiting for?!' This was really a truly great movie and I'm pretty sure that it's on my top 10 favorite romantic comedy movies now.",10,0,0,24 March 2011
Grease," Grease is the word
","Great musical. All the songs were great and catchy. My favorites were Grease, Summer Nights, Look at Me I'm Sandra Dee, Hopelessly Devoted to You, Greased Lightning, You're the One that I Want and We Go Together. I'm glad Glee introduced Summer Nights and You're the One that I Want. Definite favorites.The plot wasn't really that superb, but it was good enough considering that it was a movie made in 1978! Now, this plot is sort of the ones you see in fan fictions. Bad boy falls in love with innocent girl. Not that unique, but whatever. It was an old movie! And I seriously cannot get over the great quality of the songs. I was really impressed. They're all so catchy! Such a great musical. I only wish I could see the play, for real.After watching the ending and that last dance scene, I thought that it reminded me of High School Musical. I think that the ending was so cliché. (SPOILERS) Did everyone really have to get paired up with the group of friends from the 'other group'? So unrealistic. Speaking of unrealistic, what was up with that flying car scene?! That was so out of place.The ending, where Danny let go off his bad boy image and Sandy changed from her cute innocent self to a 'bad girl' wasn't the greatest. I didn't like it. I liked Sandy more as the pretty quiet girl. I'm sure it was meant to be an unexpected sort of twist, but I'm sure that there were people who got offended by that. (/SPOILERS)If you have nothing to do for 2 hours and want to spend it watching a musical filled with great songs, this is the movie for you! Grease is totally the word. It won't disappoint.",8,1,2,27 January 2011
The Village," Creepy, but not so much
","Before actually watching this movie, I did some research. I saw tons of people complaining about the twist ending, so I was wondering what in the world happened that made people hate it so much. The hate made me even more curious to actually watch the film, so I did!I can say that I found this movie to be quite good, but then again, I don't think it's for everyone. If you enjoy thrillers that sort of play with your mind a little, then you should give this a try. Don't be swayed by the negative comments!All the actors in this film were perfect. Their performance was simply splendid. Every last one of them. Especially 'Ivy'. Bryce Dallas Howard was brilliant! Her acting was amazing. Words cannot describe how good she was. But seriously, she was great.(SPOILERS) I found the idea of the 'Those We Don't Speak Of' to be great. It creeped me out, though. I had to lower the volume every time the scenes seemed to turn scary. But it was good. I never would have thought that they were just the Elders. I think it would have been better if there were really creatures like them. The whole idea of them, made up the creepy factor for me. Until now, I keep on glancing towards the door, half fearing that one of them will show up.I loved the relationships between people. All the characters had their own little quirks. Ivy's blind. I liked the parts where she was talking about people's colors. It reminded me of synesthesia, which I find very interesting and hope to learn more about it. Lucius is a very quiet and reserved man. But he does have feelings. He tries to keep it bottled up inside, but it gets out eventually. I never would have expected that he would stop being the main character halfway throughout the film. I mean, who kills off the main character? Unexpected twist, but very welcome. It reminded me of Death Note where that antagonist dies. Noah, a grown man who has some sort of developmental problem, likes Ivy. When he finds out Lucius and Ivy are getting married, he gets crazy. I was not expecting that at all. And the Elders? Well, they have their own messed up story. To sum it up, everyone's got their own little thing going on. It was what made this movie what it was. Great character development! Even the minor characters were great! I loved the ranger guy. His kindness and compassion- trying to help Ivy, even if meant losing his job.. Great. Gives me hope for the world. (/SPOILERS)This movie gave me a Shutter Island feel. It's like, you think you know something, but you really don't. The ending was just like Shutter Island's also. An open ending.

","I have grown up with 'Harry Potter' and as preparation for the last film, which is going to be shown this week, I am going to be re-watching all of the previous films this week.It is Harry's supposedly 7th year at school, but he chooses not to return to Hogwarts. Instead, he vows to set out to find and destroy all the Horcruxes, with his friends, Ron and Hermione. As the trio searches, they come across the existence of the Deathly Hallows- the 3 most powerful objects in the Wizarding World.I will be honest. When this first came out last year, I was expecting something big. But instead, I found myself getting bored. I found that I didn't enjoy the movie as much as I thought that I would. I found myself missing the fun that the previous films had. Where was the friendly banter between students? Where were the Quidditch games? In 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1', there is none of that. I guess I can't blame them. It's all serious now. Voldemort's growing stronger by the minute and everyone's getting ready.This movie wasn't all bad. But I found that, although it was a lengthy film, nothing ever really happened. All the good stuff took place in the first and last 10 minutes of the movie. What happened in between? I can't even remember. What a disappointment.It's sad knowing that the series is coming to an end. I just hope that 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2' will deliver and give the series the BANG! it deserves to go out with. This film just consisted of pure build-up. Just development, development and more development. Not that that wasn't bad, but where was the action and thrill? I hope that the last film will redeem the series. The franchise really needs a brilliant ending.Viewed on: July 14, 2011",6,1,2,14 July 2011
Kung Fu Panda 2," The big, fat panda kicks butt! Again!
","If I could describe 'Kung Fu Panda 2' in two words, they would be: Amazingly kick-ass. I was really in awe during all the fighting scenes. All of the action scenes (and when I say 'all', I mean ALL) were superb. They were easily the best part of this sequel.In 'Kung Fu Panda 2', viewers are introduced to a new evil villain who is bent on controlling all of China. Po, along with the Furious Five, are set on defending the Valley of Peace from this menacing peacock who has created a very powerful weapon.Aside from the action and hilarity this sequel has, viewers now get to see the background of Po and how he came to be. That was a nice touch. The emotional impact was great and quite rare when we talk about films made by DreamWorks.This sequel will leave you satisfied, but still wanting more. When it comes to sequels, it's either a surefire hit or a sad, sad miss. Thankfully, Po and his friends did not disappoint with this film, although the original was still better. The first film was a lot funnier and had more continuity. This second film lacked those. But hey, the action scenes were excellent! I will still be hopefully waiting for a third installment to this series.Viewed on: June 12, 2011",7,0,0,11 June 2011
Over the Hedge," Only children should take a peek at what's over the edge
","I think when this first came out, I thought it was a cute movie. It wasn't THAT great that I was able to remember it for 4+ years. I actually forgot that this movie existed until I saw it in one of IMDb's related pages. Was it on 'Horton Hears A Who'? I'm not really sure. The point is, this was actually a pretty forgettable movie.After rewatching it, I'll say that this movie does have its charms. I can see why kids used to swoon over Hammy or the 3 porcupine kids. But aside from that, the plot is quite serious. Or about as serious as a kids movie can get.RJ, a mischievous raccoon, gets into some pretty big trouble. He tried stealing from Vincent, a vicious bear, and had to bargain for his life. The deal was to find a whole new stash of junk food for Vincent within a week. RJ has no idea where to begin collecting all the loads of food he stole. Luckily, he stumbles upon some other wild animals who just woke up from a seasons worth of hibernating. Upon waking up, the wild animals, who are composed of two possums, a skunk, a family of porcupine, a squirrel and a turtle, are surprised to see that a huge bush-like thing has been created, limiting their habitat. RJ convinces them to venture beyond the hedge since a whole new world awaits them there. And thus begins RJ's scheming and trickery.The ending is quite predictable, seeing as it is a film by Dreamworks. Nevertheless, the humor makes it enjoyable for both kids and adults. The message and theme of the movie does make the movie worth seeing. It teaches people about the importance of family and friendships, which I think is a pretty darn good message. It's just quite sad that I didn't like this movie as much as I used to. I guess this movie, like many other Dreamworks films, is best suited for children.",5,0,0,30 March 2011
Salt," Why action films are one of my favorite movie genres
","A Russian spy accuses Evelyn Salt, a CIA agent, of planning the assassination of one of the President of Russia. She quickly goes on the run, which makes her fellow CIA agents question who she really is and what her motives really are.I really did like the action that was in this film. I was enthralled with the fighting scenes, the car scenes, and just the whole action aspect of the film. Angelina Jolie did good with this one. Although the plot did get predictable, I was still quite impressed. Sure, it could have been a lot deeper, but this was meant to just be a fun action film to watch. It's really as simple as that! I don't get why others don't seem to like this one. I'm already excited for the possible sequel of this movie.Viewed on: December 26, 2011",8,2,5,27 December 2011
She's the Man," The humor was better served 5 years ago
","If I was the same 9-11 year old that I was when I first watched this movie, I would have given this film an easy 10, no doubt about that!I remember when I first saw the DVD cover and its confusing (but inviting!) subheadings: Everybody has a secret... Duke wants Olivia who likes Sebastian who is really Viola whose brother is dating Monique so she hates Olivia who's with Duke to make Sebastian jealous who is really Viola who's crushing on Duke who thinks she's a guy... Even now, I'm going, 'SAY WUUUT?' What more for the past me?It was a funny movie, no doubt about that. I watched this movie with my maids. I actually thought about downloading it (not because If felt like I wanted to watch it, but..) because Gigi said that she wanted to watch this movie again after many years. I just decided be a friendly hostess by surprising her with this movie. :D I can say that all 3 of our helpers enjoyed it. Maybe they enjoyed it more than me, but that's okay. :)Even if my initial thoughts while the movie was starting was that I had matured a lot and am too 'mature' for the jokes that this movie has, I admit that I had more laughs than I thought I would have. The part where Viola's hot girl friends came and helped her trick 'Sebastian''s friends were hot and sexy. There were lots more other good and funny scenes, like that final soccer game where Sebastian and Viola showed their 'assets' to prove their true gender. I bet I laughed way harder back then. Hahaha!I think that the ending was very unrealistic, though. I can't believe that I only realized that now. Though, I have a vague feeling that my younger self kind of questioned this. Why would Olivia go so easily with the real Sebastian? Shouldn't she have been hesitant or something? And how did Duke suddenly fall in 'like' with Viola after only meeting her once? Unrealistic. Aside from those, the whole movie was in fact, unrealistic! But then again, if it wasn't made that way, we wouldn't have had a movie now, would we?I think the main thing that I just want to emphasize about this movie was that the younger you are, the funnier you'll find it. Or if you watch it with a child or someone who has a child-like sense of humor.. Yeah. You can count on having a good time. But either way, you're bound to have a few good laughs here and there. :D",7,0,0,24 January 2011
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Darker, but definitely more magical
","I have grown up with 'Harry Potter' and as preparation for the last film, which is going to be shown this week, I am going to be re-watching all of the previous films this week.In the wizarding world, there is a criminal on the loose- Sirius Black. He has escaped from his imprisonment at Azkaban for the murder of Harry's parents and is looking for Harry. He is now at large and Dementors (soul-sucking guardians of Azkaban) are seen everywhere, searching for him.The plot may seem normally adequate, but I really think that this third installment was brilliant. This was a lot better than the first two movies. I loved the new characters who were introduced, especially Remus Lupin. I particularly liked the humor and sheer fun that this movie had. Yes, this movie was dark, but the touch of humor added here and there in dialogues, balanced the movie out.I remember when I first watched this movie, I thought that it was too long. I think it was because I was too young to actually understand what was happening. Now that I'm older, I can see why this film is a definite favorite amongst fans. 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' really is magical. You can see it everywhere. There were so many things that were happening in this movie. But surprisingly, it worked. I never got the feeling that events were too fast paced. The flow was great. I don't know how they did that!Viewed on: July 10, 2011",9,0,1,10 July 2011
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Movie shaped out of the video game world
","Great movie. It reminded me of the other Michael Cera films, like Juno and Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist, maybe? This film kept me interested throughout most of the film. Plus, the obvious humor and the graphics were a great plus, too.The plot was certainly different. Come to think of it, this whole movie was like a video game unfolding right before your eyes. I found myself getting bored in the fight scenes, but I think those parts were pretty good. It just wasn't for me. The storyline was different, but it worked. It did, somehow. The ending was also unexpected. Totally love Knives.Overall, I think what I liked about this movie were the characters and the graphics. The plot, while interesting, just wasn't for me. I did like the love story, but not the fighting scenes. The humor made it an enjoyable experience for me, though.",7,0,3,23 February 2011
Bridesmaids," Just what was so funny..
","Annie's best friend, Lilian, has just gotten engaged, and Annie has been picked to be Lilian's maid of honor. Annie finds that the other bridesmaids are very different from her personality. Aside from that, there are a lot of other things going on in her life. Annie must learn how to adjust accordingly, to make her best friend's wedding perfect.I've read one good review about 'Bridesmaids' before, saying how it was inspiring and nice. That review made me want to see this movie. But now that I've watched it? Yeech. Really, guys? A 7.2/10 for this movie? This was not an entertaining movie.I didn't find this movie that funny. The movie could have been funnier if the jokes were toned down a bit. But they weren't. I found some of the jokes to be tasteless. I also found that I didn't feel anything for the characters. I didn't care for the romance plot or Annie's business or etc. This movie was boring. And for people who said this was inspiring? Really? Really? I'll give credit to the little 'best friend triangle' plot, though.'Bridesmaids' is no 'Bride Wars'.

Cars 2," Not Pixar's best film, but still certainly enjoyable!
","'Cars 2' is the sequel to 'Cars' (well, duh). The only thing is, the two movies are hardly related to each other. In 'Cars', Lightning McQueen, a spoiled hotshot race car, discovers the meaning of true family and friendship. In 'Cars 2', the story focuses on Mater (McQueen's best friend) and how he somehow gets caught up in a spy mission.I was prepared for disappointment, considering all the reviews that I heard. But I was really surprised! 'Cars 2' was very enjoyable! The humor was funny and the action was great! I did like the plot. It sort of reminded me of a real James Bond film. Who knew talking cars and an action/mystery genre could work?Most of the reasons that people didn't like this film was because this sequel wasn't related to 'Cars' at all. But if the first film wasn't considered, then people would find that 'Cars 2' is actually be a pretty good movie! But to be honest, I think that I would have liked this movie more if it was a new original Pixar movie, not just a sequel to 'Cars'.While watching this, just forget about 'Cars' for a while and enjoy the humor and action that 'Cars 2' gives. Pixar still did good!Viewed on: August 29, 2011",6,3,5,29 August 2011
Ghostbusters," Must have worked better in the 80s
","'Ghost Busters' is a 1984 comedic film that follows the jobs of 3 parapsychology scientists as they capture and destroy ghosts from their town.While searching for good comedy films to watch, the recommendation of 'Ghost Busters' (1984) kept on coming up. I then remembered vaguely that there was a TV show version of the series. I never really watched even an episode, but I do remember seeing the opening credits and tidbits of the show here and there. So I thought I'd give it a try. I was in the mood for some laughs, after all.The film worked well in the first half. Though I never really laughed out loud, I could see that it was entertaining. But after the actual plot took place, I lost all interest. It became too boring and took away the movie's charm. The jokes started to get old, too. The visual effects didn't help keep my interest, either. I found my eyes drooping!I understand that this movie is pretty old, so it may have been amazing for people who watched it first when it came out in the 1980's, but when you watch it in the late 2000s, it doesn't really do anything for you.Viewed on: May 3, 2011",4,28,56,2 May 2011
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Hilarious, imaginative and leaves you w/ a happy feeling
","This movie has got to be one of the most hilarious animated films ever. And the best thing is that the humor didn't seem forced or out of place. The humor that was incorporated in the movie, actually went with the plot, but it wasn't that strong to overpower the movie and the plot itself.When I first saw the trailer for this, I didn't think it was anything special. I thought it would just be another mediocre movie targeted for children. I mean, food falling from the sky? Really? Really? I had no plans of seeing it, but when my dad showed up with tickets to the IMAX movie, I didn't fight it either. 'Oh, he's already bought the tickets! Might as well watch it!' So I went into the movie theater, not expecting anything great from this movie. Wow, was I surprised. I found myself getting sucked into the story. The characters were lovable, goofy and realistic. The animation was great and the 3D helped! I think this is one of the best animated films put into 3D. If I could watch it again in the IMAX theater, I would.Flint Lockwood is an aspiring scientist. Ever since he was a little boy, he has dreamed of creating big things. Over the years, as he has been growing, all he's ever experienced was disappointment. His inventions have all failed miserably, until one day, Flint decides to try his latest invention- a machine that creates food out of water! However, lots of things go on and somehow, the machine ends up in the sky. Flint's lost hope of ever seeing the machine again, until later, it starts raining food. And that is when things get messy.I learned, after first watching the movie, that this was adapted from a children's book. I've never read the book, but after watching this movie, I'm planning on reading it soon. Judging from some of the reviews, most people say that they were first fans of the children's book and this movie lived up to it, even if it added its own twist on things. I guess that's a good thing, then!'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' is a happy film that will surely leave people smiling. This isn't only a movie for children! I'm sure teenagers and adults will enjoy it. In my opinion, this film could rival Dreamworks and actually be a product of Pixar.Viewed on: April 6, 2011",9,2,3,5 April 2011
Dumb and Dumber," A film anyone can understand!

Even though the plot wasn't the best one, it was good enough for a comedy film! Even better than most plots of comedies. Lloyd and Harry are off to return a briefcase that was left behind in airport, unintentionally getting involved in some very dangerous events.All the scenes were hilarious, I'm not even kidding! You'll be sure to be laughing the entire time. ('One time, we successfully mated a bulldog with a shih tzu.' 'Really? That's weird!'

The Adjustment Bureau," Original plot and very intriguing
","I was surprised to see a lot of negative comments about this movie, seeing as how I thought this movie was brilliant. It had this whole playing-with-your-mind factor which kept viewers interested. But it wasn't as mind-blowing as 'Inception' was, though.I'm glad that the movie lived up to the promises of action, thrill and romance that was shown in the trailer. The people who decided what to put in the trailer should also be given props. Not much was given away, but the audience got the gist of the movie. I was surprised at many events that happened during the viewing. All trailers should be like this one, not like those overly long trailers like 'Charlie St. Cloud' where they practically reveal everything. This movie had a great trailer that attracted lots of expectant viewers to a great movie.This is one of those movies where it feels like the events could actually be happening in real life. What if all those little times when we had a blackout or when the TV screen becomes static-y or when we drop our things, were all planned to somehow alter our course in life? It made me wonder.This is a great movie. I would have given this movie a perfect 10 if I hadn't got brainwashed by some of the posts in the discussion board. If I read those posts before I went out, I probably wouldn't have chosen to see this movie. Don't listen to naysayers. I'm surprised they even exist.

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Disappointing lack of emotional attachment
","I have grown up with 'Harry Potter' and as preparation for the last film, which is going to be shown this week, I am going to be re-watching all of the previous films this week.It is Harry Potter's 5th year in Hogwarts and he is met with much misfortune. Hardly anyone believes him or Dumbledore when they say that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has really returned. Both of them are scoffed at and thought to be ridiculous. The Ministry of Magic has even gone so far as to appoint one of their own, as a teacher in Hogwarts, to keep things on track. The new teacher is nasty and utterly unfair. On top of all that, Harry has been having some mysterious dreams that are somehow related to the Dark Lord, Voldemort.After watching this, I realized that I hardly felt any emotional attachment with any of the characters. The closest I felt to sheer happiness was when (SPOILERS:) the Weasley twins burst in during the Year 5's OWLs and when the centaurs raised off to the deeper parts of the Forbidden Forest with Dolores Umbridge. Other than that, I didn't feel anything. Even during the ending. Oh, except for that tiny pang I felt when Luna and Harry shared that small moment, though. (/SPOILERS) It's weird saying that I didn't really feel anything about characters in a 'Harry Potter' film. But that is how I felt (or lack of) while watching this movie.I have yet to read the book (don't judge, I'm waiting for all the movies to come out first), but I know that it is one of the longest in the series. This movie is only 138 minutes, which is less than previous movies. So I'm guessing that a lot of scenes have been left out. Hm.'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' is an adequate enough movie. It's not my favorite one, but I don't particularly hate it, either. It's so-so. But I really did miss that emotional attachment that other Potter movies gave. I also missed the Quidditch games that the other movies had. And the school work given. Oh well.Viewed on: July 12, 2011",6,0,0,12 July 2011

","This movie focuses on Puss, who is mostly known for his appearances in the 'Shrek' films. We learn about his background story and how the past led to the task that Puss has to face now- find the magic beans.I decided to see this on a whim, really. I wasn't really planning to watch this movie at all, but it just came to me! I couldn't do anything. So yeah. This movie was entertaining, but it didn't really make an impression on me. 'Puss in Boots' is just another animated movie to me.I liked how all the fairy tale characters just meshed and blended with each other- a detail that I always liked from the original 'Shrek' movies. I would have liked to see a little bit of how Puss ended up meeting with Shrek and the rest of the gang. But this was also okay. Jack and Jill, Humpty Dumpty, the Golden Goose and many more!I just found myself getting confused at the end. I had a lot of questions and found that there was a lot of loose ends. The movie didn't have a good ending, in my opinion. But the movie had lots of funny parts and it did keep me laughing. My reason for giving this a 4 is that I just don't think I'll be wanting to re-watch this movie any time soon. As I said, I think 'Puss in Boots' will be just another one of those animated movies that I watched just because I could.Viewed on: November 12, 2011",4,5,14,12 November 2011
There's Something About Mary," Rude, tasteless and boring
","I was expecting this movie to be at least a decent romance movie. I was wrong. It was my own fault. I decided to watch this movie because I judged it by the title and the plot line. I thought it would be a good romance comedy like 'When Harry Met Sally'. I should have researched about this film more. That's 119 minutes of my life that's gone now. Do yourself a favor and don't watch this. I don't get why it's rated a 7.2, there have been much much better films that were rated much lower. Goes to show that IMDb ratings suck.I would have liked this movie if there weren't so many tasteless jokes inserted into it that weren't even funny. If you like movies with raunchy humor that repeats its gags over and over, then maybe you'll like this movie. I know I didn't.Viewed on: April 7, 2011",3,1,2,7 April 2011
Super 8," Lack of backstory and plot development was the downfall of this movie
","While watching 'Super 8', I found that I was really enjoying myself. The actors were great. They were all young kids and had a lot of talent. I think that many of my favorite scenes in the movie were scenes where it had the all of them, just interacting. I felt like they were just a normal group of friends who got caught up in this whole whirlwind of events. They acted like any young teenagers. The actors made this movie.After the movie ended, I still kept thinking that it was great. It was only after time had passed and the adrenaline set in, when I began realizing that this movie wasn't perfect. Not at all.'Super 8' really lacked a good backstory. For example, (SPOILERS:) in the beginning of the movie, we see a young boy mourning over the death of his mother, Elizabeth. Pretty quickly after, we see the boy's father arresting a blond man. Later on, we learn that the blond man was the guy who was sort of responsible for Elizabeth's death. (/SPOILERS) I kept waiting for more explanation on this event. How did it happen? What were their jobs? But I got no explanation. That sucked.But the real downfall of the movie was the ending. Aside from some questions that were left unanswered (see example above), the movie was pretty great. The acting was very good, the dialogue was witty and smart and the whole atmosphere was just fit for the movie. The buildup to the climax of the movie was brilliant. I was really interested in it. But the ending really disappointed me. These were some questions that I had after the movie: (SPOILERS:) Why didn't the alien kill the humans? What was it keeping them around for? Why didn't the alien just build a spaceship already once it was free? Did it have to wait for someone's approval and/or encouragement? (/SPOILERS) Those things really bothered me.'Super 8' is a pretty good film. Disregarding the plot holes, it's a very interesting movie. It's not the best science-fiction movie out there, but it's good. If you had to choose between 'Green Lantern' or this one, go with 'Super 8'.Viewed on: June 26, 2011",7,1,3,26 June 2011
Rio," An animation bursting with color that makes up for the movie's quality
","I was excited to see this film because the teasers seemed funny enough and I heard that the people who made this film were the same guys who produced the awesome 'Ice Age' movie. But after getting the tickets, I began feeling worried and guilty. 'What if the movie wasn't as good as I thought it would be? What if the money that we used wasn't worth it? What if I've just wasted my afternoon by seeing this film? What if this is just another movie meant for children?' But all those thoughts stopped as the opening credits began and the screen filled with a great landscape view and then suddenly, birds of every color bursted into a lively song.Blu, a Mackaw, is taken as a pet while he is still young, by a sweet girl named Linda. As years pass, Linda and Blu form a special friendship where they both trust,love and care for the other. The only problem is that Blu, a bird, can't seem to fly. One day, Tulio, an ornithologist, informs Linda that her pet seems to be the last male of his kind. He asks Linda if Blu and herself could be flown to Brazil so that Blu could mate with the last female of their kind. Linda, after some hesitation, agrees. However, things don't quite go as planned. Jewel, the last female Macaw, doesn't take well to Blu and because of some unfortunate circumstances, both Blu and Jewel get lost in the wild chained up together.The humor was not bad. I actually found myself laughing, which I didn't really expect. Some of the songs in the movie annoyed me. I think this movie would have been a lot better if it didn't have a musical-like feel. The ending of the movie is very predictable, but even so, that doesn't mean that you won't feel that short euphoria that all happy endings give us.The animation is great. The background and the settings were just brilliant. So much color! It made me think that Rio does seems like a grand place to take a vacation in. The parade scene made me appreciate Rio's beauty more, too! If I could rewatch one scene from the movie, I'd pick the parade scene. There's just so much going on and it's a pretty cool scene. If ever you decide to watch this movie, be on a look out for that scene since it really is beautiful and fun to watch.Viewed on: April 10, 2011",6,2,13,10 April 2011

Harry has absolutely no relief in his life. But on his 11th birthday, Harry learns a secret. He is actually a wizard. Harry is suddenly thrust into a world full of magic and is invited to attend the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. In school, Harry makes new friends and learns many new things. However, Harry quickly finds out, that in the wizarding world, problems do exist and there are more dangers than he can imagine.When this movie first came out, I was about 6-7 years old. While re-watching it again, I did look forward to some scenes. Those scenes were the ones that stuck with me through out these ten years. (SPOILERS:) Two scenes that I remember the most were when 1.) Hagrid did the tapping thing on the bricks and 2.) the chess scene- where Ron sacrificed himself. (/SPOILERS)Re-watching this movie made me really feel nostalgic. Sure, the last time I watched this movie was just last year, in preparation for 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1'. But while watching it now, I still felt chills during the Quidditch scene and the ending. I don't think I'll ever stop feeling that.Watching it again, I realized that I didn't find this movie as great as it was to me when I was younger.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Olympics-- 'Harry Potter' style
","I have grown up with 'Harry Potter' and as preparation for the last film, which is going to be shown this week, I am going to be re-watching all of the previous films this week.It is Harry Potter's 4th year at Hogwarts. It is also the same year that the multi-wizardly school Triwizard Tournament is going to be held. Three students from three different schools are going to be competing for the trophy. Only students over the age of 17 are allowed to participate, so all students and teachers are surprised when Harry is called to partake in the dangerous games.This movie serves as a prologue to the darker side of 'Harry Potter' which is going to be more evident in the next films. When I first watched this movie back in 2005, I remember being really amazed with it. The games were intensely great and I really liked the budding romances between characters. Once again, the flow between the scenes were done greatly. There felt like there were many stories, but they were all interwoven with each other perfectly.I really did love the games here. It was the Olympics-- 'Harry Potter' style. I think that 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' was a great 'laid-back' film that gave viewers a chance to enjoy Harry's less serious life, before things start getting really dark in the franchise.Viewed on: July 11, 2011",8,0,1,11 July 2011

He must clear his name and find a way to fight the system.I've wanted to watch this movie ever since it came out in theaters. I liked the movie's idea. It seemed very intriguing. Sad to say, after having watched it, my high hopes were for naught. The execution of the movie fails.Justin Timberlake was great. Amanda Seyfriend was like cardboard, on the other hand. Together, they had no chemistry. Aside from that, the script was very forgettable. I hardly remember anything from this film. It was just a disappointment. Enough said. It's sad because the movie's concept really does seem interesting. Save your time and don't watch this one.Viewed on: December 25, 2011",4,1,4,27 December 2011
Thor," Full of thunderous riveting action scenes
","'Thor' was a great Marvel film. Although not on the same level as 'Spider-Man', it was still good and highly enjoyable. I wasn't expecting to enjoy this film as much as I had, which was a pretty pleasant experience for me.Thor is a powerful warrior in the realm of Asgard. He was set to become next in line for King, but was banished from his homeland and was sent to Earth after one of his thoughtless actions.The plot seems very 'normal' and/or 'cliche' for science-fiction movies, but 'Thor' proved that even a mediocre and often-used plot could be turned great. The mythological additions to the movie were wonderfully done. It made the film more interesting.The fighting scenes were all really intense and my eyes were really glued to the screen. I can't even choose a favorite action sequence! They were all just really good. Another great thing about this movie was the humor. Believe me, there are many one-liners that will most likely get you to chuckle.I loved the twist in the plot, too. I was honestly surprised by it. That was funny because I thought I had the story and the characters all figured out. It turns out that I didn't. (SPOILERS:) It only made me love Loki more. From the beginning, I had this thought that he'd turn out to be the villain (I mean, hello! Dead-like eyes?), and I was right. I wasn't expecting him to be a double-crosser! That was a big, but pleasant, surprise for me. I was sad that he chose to 'die' in the end. I wanted him to rule the land of Asgard with Thor. Oh well. (/SPOILERS)I didn't care for the romance that 'Thor' had. Natalie Portman and the rest of her family didn't actually do anything for this film. Except for add to the humor of the movie. (SPOILERS:) I was glad the movie ended the way it did. Unlike the standard that mythology action-romance films seem to have, where when the god falls in love with a mortal, he gives up his god-like status in the end to be with the girl and etc. I'm so glad that 'Thor' didn't go down that worn-out road. (/SPOILER)The only bad thing about this movie was the 3D. While everything did seem to have that 3D effect, the colors were very drained out. It didn't help that the movie already had dark hues to begin with. It was hard to see, especially during the start of the film. But other than that, it was good! Save your money and enjoy this riveting film the classic way: good 'ol 2D style.Viewed on: May 5, 2011",8,0,2,5 May 2011
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," The 'Harry Potter' installment that I really remembered
","I have grown up with 'Harry Potter' and as preparation for the last film, which is going to be shown this week, I am going to be re-watching all of the previous films this week.It is Harry Potter's supposedly 2nd year at Hogwarts. But a few days before he is supposed to attend school, he meets Dobby, an house-elf. Dobby warns him not to go back to Hogwarts for strange and terrible things are going to happen. Harry doesn't heed Dobby's warning. He continues with his original plan- attend school in Hogwarts. But maybe he should have listened to Dobby, for strange and terrible things did indeed happen- things that involve the mysterious Chamber of Secrets.I don't know what it was about this film that made me remember it the most from all the others I watched when I was younger. Maybe it was because of the mystery that it gave. (SPOILERS:) I remember being really scared of the basilisk scene. (/SPOILERS) It's a wonder that I didn't feel scared while going watching it. I guess things do change.In this film, I enjoyed practically everything. I enjoyed the mystery that it gave. I enjoyed the school work that it showed- simple things like Professor Sprout's class, the Quidditch match (of course), and even Gilderoy Lockhart's class. (SPOILERS:) In the succeeding films, that's one factor that I miss the most. The simple school work that this film (and the previous one) showed. It just made Hogwarts seem like an actual school. (/SPOILERS) And most of all, I enjoyed the satire and humor. Rupert Grint was hilarious, without even trying. Props to you, Rupert!This film has a long run time- 160 minutes. However, I must give props because it certainly didn't feel that long. I didn't feel bored while watching it in 2002 and I certainly didn't feel bored while I watched it again today. This film, along with the first one, showed the less frightening and less dark times that Harry experienced. It's only going to get darker from here. I'm excited.Viewed on: July 10, 2011",8,0,1,10 July 2011
When Harry Met Sally...," Best romantic-comedy movie of all time
","I hadn't even hit the first time-skip before realizing that the movie that I was watching was absolutely amazing and was possibly the best movie in the romance genre that I have ever watched. I fear that the next romance movies that I watch, won't live up to the standards that 'When Harry Met Sally' set for me.I think what appealed to me most about this movie was the slow, but steady friendship that Harry and Sally had and nurtured. The time-skips made the movie seem more realistic. Instead of those crappy teenage romance films we have now (where the characters fall in love with each other as soon as they meet), in this film, we're greeted with a refreshing change of pace, where nothing is rushed. It is a beautifully done movie.I fell in love the characters during the first 10 minutes of the film. Harry and Sally drove to New York City and became acquaintances. Their conversations mostly led to arguments caused mostly by Harry who was played by Bill Crystal. Bill had the best lines. He was the funniest character in the movie.My favorite part of the movie was the time when they were best friends. They'd talk to each other before they went to bed. They had daily lunches out. One particular scene that I remember the most during the peak of their friendship, was when Harry began talking in a robotic tone and encouraged Sally to join him. That part was adorable. It didn't seem forced. They were just having sweet, innocent fun.The script was amazing. It was filled with so much wit. The dialogue also flowed very well. It was just so natural. The last lines of the movie were great and very, very romantic.Harry: I came here tonight because when you realize that you wanna spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.This movie is definitely a classic. I can't believe I didn't watch this one sooner. If you like romance flicks or if you feel like watching a heartwarming movie, be sure not to miss this gem. And even if you don't fit in in either categories, the comedy in this movie will be sure to keep you entertained.",10,0,1,3 January 2011
Love Actually," Love is all around us
","A romance movie that wasn't about a love story, but about the wonderful gift of love itself.I wanted to download this movie some time when I was planning to watch Black Swan (December 28, 2010). I thought this would be a nice and heartwarming film like When Harry Met Sally, but it wasn't. It reminded me of that 2010 movie, Valentine's Day. In fact, I downloaded VD just to compare what was better.There were a number of crude scenes that I wasn't really expecting to see. John and Judy's 'sex' scenes were very.. Mhmm. Turns out they were both actors who did naughty movies or something of the like.My favorites were Jamie & Aurélia (a writer and his Portuguese maid) and Sam & Joanna (young children).When it was still in the middle of the movie, I found that I wasn't particularly interested in any of the relationships except for Juliet & Peter (newlyweds) and Mark (Peter's best friend). I was wishing that they'd have included at least ONE homosexual couple in the movie, but ha. As if. I was wishing that Mark would be secretly in love with Peter, but.. Yeah, right. Turns out Mark was in love with Juliet, even though he's never talked to her before. :| Very unrealistic, if you ask me. I must admit that their ending scene (Mark with the cards), was very sweet, though. :D While watching Sam finding Joanna in the airport, I felt all kinds of chills. That was the moment where we see everyone being interconnected. When Daniel (Sam's stepfather) tells Sam to run, we see the mysterious jewelry salesman (who was introduced during Harry's- I couldn't see him as anyone other than Professor Snape, by the way- scene of buying an expensive necklace) kind of 'distract' the airport employee. It made me smile. Rowan Atkinson (I couldn't see him as anything other than Mr. Bean) reminded me of an angel. After Sam runs through more obstacles (outrunning guards, for example), he stumbles upon another conflict; 3 staff employees guarding the entrance gate. Then Billy Mack (rock singer) comes up and catches everyone's attention. That is when Sam managed to run past, undetected. Very sweet.My favorite scene, however was Jamie & Aurélia's. We saw Jamie take Portuguese language classes. It was obvious he was trying to learn the language so that he could talk to Aurélia. When he reaches the restaurant where Aurélia works, he makes a big speech in her language, with many errors. In the end, he asks Aurélia to marry him. I was surprised by her answer. 'Yes is being my answer. Easy question.' It hit me. She tried learning his language, too! I felt so heart-warmed by that. :) Probably why they were my favorite couple in the movie.The last scene- where we see everyone again- was nice. It put closure in everyone's love story. Billy & Joe's friendship was nice. I even thought they'd be the unexpected twist in the end, where Billy was gay for his manager. But, of course that wouldn't happen. Juliet & Peter are happily married, with Mark being the supportive best friend. Jamie & Aurélia are still together. We also see that Aurélia's grammar has improved significantly. Harry comes back and there are no hard feelings between him and Karen. Or are they just being civil? I can't tell. Joanna comes back and Sam's there to greet her, with his stepfather, Daniel- who's there with another single parent he met, Carol- is also there with him. John & Judy are getting engaged. Colin comes back from America with a beautiful girlfriend, who brought her sister for Tony. David comes back from a trip and Natalie greets him with a kiss.Yes. Too many relationships. I know. I even got confused myself! That's the biggest problem, in my opinion. That's why I gave this movie a low rating. However, I don't think this movie should really be analyzed. People should just look at the big picture- the message that the movie is sending.'Love is everywhere. Often, it's not particularly dignified or newsworthy, but it's always there - fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, old friends. When the planes hit the Twin Towers, as far as I know, none of the phone calls from the people on board were messages of hate or revenge. They were all messages of love. If you look for it, I've got a sneaking feeling you'll find that love actually is all around.' That's it. Love is all around. We all know that, but we don't particularly remember it. That's why this movie is here. It's to remind us of that fact that most of us take for granted or hardly even notice. Love is all around us. I did like that song, by the way.",9,1,2,12 January 2011
Ice Age," A cool film that kept me laughing back when I was younger
","Manny, Sid and Diego, a mammoth, a sloth and a saber-toothed tiger, form a surprising trio as they journey through the ice-ridden mountains of the Ice Age to return a lost human infant that they found. However, one of them has a hidden ulterior motive..I remember that I watched this movie twice in theaters in 2002. I was laughing like there was no tomorrow when this was out. Granted, I was quite young- about 7-years-old or so. The good memories that I had of this film were what pushed me to re-watch the trilogy. :)Re-watching the film now, I can see that the story line was a bit too simple. Just fit for a kids film. If I was still the 7-year-old me that had watched this years ago, I would have given this an instant 10. But time does things for people, and for that I'm giving it a 7.'Ice Age' is a GREAT film for young children. Or even parents watching it with their children. It will garner lots of laughs from the silly antics the trio get themselves into.",7,1,1,4 November 2011
X-Men: First Class," First Class is right
","I will be honest and say that I haven't fully watched the X-Men trilogy, but this prequel made me want to watch all the movies. I guess I know what I'm going to be doing in the next couple of weeks.I know that this movie is part of a bigger franchise, but this was a GREAT film on its own. Although, it will leave you wanting more. I know I'm dying for another movie. In 'X-Men: First Class', I don't think there was ever a dull scene. I remember being interested in it all the way. I never felt my attention waver or feel a yawn coming up.Aside from the kick-ass action, this movie had its own share of good humor that doesn't fail. The audience must have laughed out loud together, at least three times. I also especially liked the emotions that were being portrayed to the audience. I could care less about Raven's love life, but I really did love the bromance that Charles and Erik shared.I don't have any other X-Men movies to compare this one to (aside from the spin-off 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'), so this may either be a hit or miss with die-hard X-Men fans. But coming from an unbiased viewer, I can say that this was an excellent film. If you haven't watched it yet, what are you waiting for?!Viewed on: June 11, 2011",9,2,5,11 June 2011
The Emperor's New Groove," Is this the most hilarious Disney movie?
","I can't believe that this movie is over 10 years old. I remember going to the theater to first watch this movie and I loved it. I may have been very young during that time, but the funny-looking characters and the outrageous scenes that they were in, were enough to keep my 5-year-old self entertained. Now that I'm older, I think that I can better appreciate this movie because now, I can understand the sharp one-liners and jokes. The dialogue in this film is a hoot and a half. It's very witty, really! Adults and children are sure to have fun with this movie.After watching this, I had to check what company produced this film. It's a Walt Disney animation! Who would have thunk! The humor is excellent! Almost every scene will have you either smiling, giggling, chuckling, laughing or just leave you speechless with the hilarity of it all. Just because this is an animated film made for children, I believe that even adults will enjoy this. The humor. It is brilliant. Really.Aside from the mirth that this movie gives, there is a good plot! And this film shows great character development and leaves people with a good moral and a great feeling. But humor is really what dominates this film and makes it what it is.",8,1,2,9 April 2011
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," And a third time's the charm!
","Manny and Ellie are expecting a baby, which makes Diego and Sid question themselves. Diego yearns to be back out in the wild and Sid wishes he had a family of his own. Due to Sid's determination, he ends up stealing some baby eggs, which results in everyone discovering a new world filled with dinosaurs.The movies in this trilogy just keep getting better and better! This film still has the humor and charm that the last two movies had. It kept me entertained. Sequels usually don't do good in the market- more so if it is a threequel. Surprisingly, 'Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs' wasn't at all bad! The new additions were hilarious and amusing.My only complaint about the movie was the unnecessary 'too-long' footage of Scrat and his female frenemy. I think the movie could have done better if it wasn't for them. I would have liked to see more of the main gang, rather than Scrat and his nut problems. It gets tiring after a while.Overall, this was still a funny movie! A great addition to the trilogy! I still wonder if there will be a fourth movie to the franchise.. I can only hope that it stays as funny and as true to these three movies.",7,1,1,6 November 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Will leave you with that unexplainable feeling
","I don't even know how to begin this review of mine, but let me just start by saying this-- for fans of the decade-long 'Harry Potter' saga, everything all comes down to this final movie. I've spent the entire week re-watching all seven previous films to prepare for this last movie.Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is in danger, now that the Dark Lord has gotten ahold of the powerful Elder Wand. Harry, Ron and Hermione return to their school for one last stand against the dark forces that threaten to take over the Wizarding and Muggle worlds. They must also continue their quest of finding and destroying the last three remaining Horcruxes so as to defeat Lord Voldemort. If I could use only one word to sum up 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2', it would be 'intense'. I never once looked away from the movie screen. All the scenes (and I mean, ALL) were intriguing and filled with action. It was as if all the build-up in 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1' exploded and turned into fiery hot action here in this movie.I have yet to read the books, so I don't know how the book compares to the movie, but coming from a loyal movie fan, I thought that the conclusion to the decade-long series was brilliant. It wasn't perfect, but it came pretty damn close. Just one minus for some scenes that seemed a bit too rush. Plus points for everything else!I still don't know how to explain this post-movie feeling that I'm having. I did not cry, weirdly enough. But I am devastated that there will be no more future movies. The best quote that I could find to explain what I am feeling is this: 'I'm sad that it's over, but I'm glad that it happened.'When the movie ended, the audience applauded. I loved the camaraderie that we all shared. Even if we were strangers to one another, we had all shared a special moment, thanks to Harry Potter. The 'Harry Potter' franchise has been doing that for years and years now. Thank you, Chris Columbus. Thank you, David Yates. Thank you, Daniel, Rupert, Emma and the rest of the cast. And of course, a million thank yous, J.K. Rowling. 'Harry Potter' has really touched a lot of lives. Including mine. Thank you for my childhood, guys. Although the movies are over, 'Harry Potter' will still live on in our hearts. As J.K. Rowling said-- Hogwarts will always be there to welcome us home.Viewed on: July 15, 2011 ; July 23, 2011",9,0,3,15 July 2011
Happy Feet," The first half of the movie was good
","But after that, it all went downhill. I guess I just didn't like the 'dark side' of Happy Feet. I found it boring and not at all entertaining. I did like Ramón, though. He and the rest of his friends, made up most of the humor for me.What really threw me off was the ending. (SPOILERS) When I saw Mumble return to Emperor Land, I thought it was all an illusion. I mean, how would he even have gotten back there? Why would the zoo bring him back when he could have been a total money bank? How did the people know that the penguins wanted fish? Shouldn't they have just been totally amazed by how they were all moving in sync? Why did they make anything seem more than it was? (/SPOILERS) Those factual errors just really threw me off and made me dislike this film.Because of the disappointment that I had over the ending, I was really temped to give this a one rating, but I did like the starting of the movie. And Ramón. Sure, it's 'just a kid's movie', but I know many other kid's movies that I liked. This is no excuse. 'Happy Feet' is just really low on my list right now. Sorry. Baby Mumble was cute, though.",3,0,0,16 March 2011
