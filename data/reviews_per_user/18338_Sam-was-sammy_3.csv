The Devil's Advocate," One of the best movies of all time
","This is simply one of the best movies of ALL time. I don't know why it has such a low rating for a film of this caliber.I was expecting a rating between 8 and 9. Right to the point,this is one of the finest performances from keanu reeves and indeed Al pacino(best i consider scarface).This is one of the finest thriller movies I have ever seen.The film has a great plot with great performances and you should definitely watch this movie and you will be surprised how you didn't watch it before and haven't heard of it as much as the great movies like the shawshank redemption,forrest gump,etc. To sum it up, I would like to just say this 'Vanity,definitely my favorite sin!'",10,3,4,23 June 2012
Million Dollar Arm," Predictable but enjoyable...definitely worth a watch!
","Based on a true story, Million Dollar Arm is a predictable motivating sport film from the Disney stable.Jon Hamm with his flawlessly groomed stubble and cocky grin plays the haughty sports agent Bernstein with ease. As a groomed smooth talker in sharply tailored corporate suits, there are few to match Hamm and he does what is expected of him. The two main characters of the movie are Suraj Sharma, the star of Life of Pi who plays Rinku and Madhur Mittal, the older brother in Slumdog Millionaire who plays Dinesh. Both of them perform their roles very beguilingly and inspire affection from the crowd. The rest of the supporting cast also perform their roles very well especially Lake Bell who was very impressive in her cameo role as Brenda.I might be a bit biased since I am from India but the comedy in the movie is hilarious...I found myself laughing throughout the movie enjoying every moment of it. The direction and editing are also pretty impressive. In a nutshell, all the elements in the movie combine really well and the result is a fine movie which has plenty to offer.So, overall, Million Dollar Arm is a finely made movie which will impress you despite being predictable and is certainly worth a watch.My Rating : 8.5 out of 10",8,50,63,10 May 2014
