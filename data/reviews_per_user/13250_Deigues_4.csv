The Lobster," A masterful exploration of the pursuit of love in the current digital landscape
","Some movies strike such a singular chord in your heart, that you feel they were made exclusively for you. For me, 'The Lobster' is such a movie.This marks Yorgos Lanthimos first English language film, but don't worry. It's just as uncompromising and delightfully weird as his other features, namely 'Dogtooth' and 'Alps'. The film is set in a dystopian future, where everyone must have a romantic partner, otherwise they are sent to the Hotel, in order to acquire one in a maximum allotted time of 45 days. If they fail to do so, the unlucky loners are transformed into an animal of their choosing and sent out to live in the wilderness. David is one such bachelor and the film follows his quest for a partner.I write a 'partner', because that truly is the purpose of the Hotel. The people in charge aren't interested in some romantic notion of true love or anything like that. The guests must partner up with someone who is an empirical match with them; whether they both suffer from sudden nose bleeds, have poor eye sight, or even a limp, they must somehow be physically compatible. Lanthimos brings us immediately his incisive satire, exploring to an extreme the social expectations of dating in the current online landscape; where you swipe endlessly to the left until you find that one person whose mere looks just click. The way Lanthimos exposes society's conventions, by pushing the concept to its extreme is what makes 'The Lobster' a humorous but also incredibly violent film.'If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face—forever.'The future in this film isn't unlike the one George Orwell described above. It operates in an artificial world, drained of human emotion. Most characters search for a partner, but only out of self-preservation. It is when David begins to experience true love, that Lanthimos masterfully explores the struggle of nurturing true affection in the current oppressive digital age. David reveals himself alive for the first time, distinguishing himself from all others, and those who don't remain indifferent react with violence.I won't reveal just how far the violence in 'The Lobster' escalates, but the ending is in perfect Lanthimos fashion, leaving you fulfilled but grasping at your seat. There are still quite a few films from 2015 that I am eager to see, but, as of now, 'The Lobster' is my favorite of the year.",10,1,6,26 February 2016
It Follows," One of the most unique horror films in recent years
","A terrific concept and a flawless execution solidify 'It Follows' as one of the best horror films in years.The film follows Jay (no pun intended), a girl who after having intercourse with a guy she'd been dating starts being followed by an unknown entity. Jay quickly aligns herself with her friends and together they try to make sense of what exactly 'It' is. The group finds out that 'It' can take the shape of anyone it pleases and will follow Jay and kill her unless she has sex with someone else and passes the 'curse' onto them. The premise isn't hard to grasp and the film does a fine job of getting the specifics out of the way quickly.David Robert Mitchell stages 'It Follows' carefully and shoots it methodically. He often frames his characters in wide shots and continuously uses pans to engulf them in their surrounding world. But what world is this? Adults are strangely scarce. 'It Follows' mainly encompasses teenagers who seem somehow adrift in their life, none of them really knowing what to do. Many have stated the premise is a metaphor for STD's, although continuously having sex with others wouldn't diminish your chance of dying.In the beginning of the film, a 21 year old states that he would like to be a little boy of 6 again, so that he would have 'his whole life ahead of him'. Maybe that's what it's about, teenage angst; having to leave the safeguard of childhood and embrace the inherent challenges of adulthood. These characters spend their time running from something they simply cannot run far enough away from. Sex is widely seen as an act of transition into adulthood and they struggle between escape and embrace. They're defiant but afraid of what the future will bring. They can try and ignore their maturity, but with each passing day, it's closer and one day they'll have to do something about it. They'll have to accept certain responsibilities and maybe confront old fears they had buried so deep, they thought they would never have to face.Of course this is my take on it. You might not agree and it might not be yours. We can disagree on that, but hopefully we'll agree on this: 'It Follows' is unique. It's unique and frightening as very few recent films have been.",9,2,6,26 February 2016
Ex Machina," Alex Garland debuts with one of the best sci-fi films of the last decade
","'EX MACHINA' isn't only of the best thrillers of 2015, it's also one of the most engaging and cerebral sci-fi films of the last decade.The plot starts with Caleb: a young coder who wins a competition to study in the secluded research facility of Nathan - one of the world's greatest computer geniuses and CEO of the company Caleb works for. There, Caleb must analyze and determine if the Artificial Intelligence that Nathan has created (played by Alicia Vikander) truly has a conscience.Contrary to most sci-fi films of this age, 'Ex Machina' doesn't rely on big set pieces and explosions to get our attention. It does it subtly. Alex Garland had already proved himself to be a great screenwriter and, while the film as a whole is great, it's the script that truly makes the movie shine. Garland takes the sci-fi setting to question what 'Blade Runner' asked us in 1982: 'What does being human really mean?'; 'At what point does something artificial become human?'; and so on Garland structures these questions and their delivery in a way that never feels heavy handed; the dialogs flow naturally and you never feel like you are listening to two computer geeks coldly talk about technical gibberish.That is also thanks to the acting, which is great all around. Oscar Isaac continues to establish himself as one of the best leading men in films, however it was Alicia Vikander that really surprised me: she was able to find the thin line between man and machine and play with it, making you doubt what is really happening underneath.I started by saying 'EX MACHINA' is an excellent and intense thriller, but it's also one of the most stylized. While I am not particularly fond of the whole digital aesthetic, seeing as 'EX MACHINA' is a film that is so intrinsically tied to that subject, I cannot help but feel that it serves its purpose. Overall, my experience in the cinema was terrific. This is the type of low key cerebral sci-fi that I most enjoy and of the best since Duncan Jones' 'Moon'. With 'EX MACHINA' Garland proves he is not only a writer to look forward to but a director as well.",9,2,5,25 February 2016
Whiplash," A simple concept with a brilliant execution
","'There are no two words in the English language more harmful than 'good job'.'This is Whiplash's mantra; Damian Chazelle's second feature starring Milles Teller, who helms the film as a driven musician and drummer in a conservatory band led by the strict and abusive mentor J.K. Simmons. The plot follows their relationship as Teller struggles to gain success and the approval of his mentor. If you're not a jazz fan, don't worry. 'Whiplash' is as much about jazz as 'Raging Bull' is about boxing. It's just background, or maybe even less than that. This is a film that knows what audiences are fed, but it also knows what they are craving. Its story might seem almost too simple or formulaic, but the urgency with which it's told is what makes it unique.In an age where most movies dawdle through their run time, unsure of where to go or what to do, 'Whiplash' is a breath of fresh air; but a breath you'll most likely be holding throughout the entire film. 'Whiplash' builds up like an exquisite piece of music and doesn't waste a single frame. Teller and Simmons's relationship is at times sick, poisonous and even destructive. Chazelle magnificently frames 'Whiplash' in ill lit and oppressive environments. Its close-ups are, for a lack of a better word, claustrophobic and make 'Whiplash' look like it just might bend the frame and burst from the film at any time. Of course a lot of this energy is merit of the actors as well and, in this case, to say that J.K. Simmons is great is an understatement. I fail to recall a more menacing and authoritative performance since R. Lee Ermey in 'Full Metal Jacket'. Damian Chazelle has taken a simple and universal concept, the eternal struggle for success and acknowledgment, and made it into an incredible and high-octane film. While I know better than to congratulate him, with 'Whiplash' I think it's safe to say he's earned it. He's done a hell of a job.",9,3,7,28 February 2016
