The Blair Witch Project," Okay, not the greatest film of the decade - a good campfire ghost story, nonetheless.
","After hearing much negative flak about this movie, I'm reminded of what I overheard two twenty-somethings saying as they left the theatre behind me: 'Man, that movie was ****! It scared the **** out of me! I hated it!'Perhaps, in an era of big-budget thrills and CGI scares at ever-increasing cost, we needed this film. Yeah, I'll concede that it was NOT the most brilliant work of art I've ever seen. But it serves as a reminder that today's jaded audiences can still be scared. And, to be perfectly clear, I liked it. I'll take a shorter cut, if it could retain the feel - the arguing did seem to drag. Still, it played like a campfire ghost story, reeling you into suspension of disbelief to deliver its wallop.Pros: Audacity, Style, Acting, Concept.Cons: Camera Work, Hype, LengthRating: ******** (8/10)",8,1,2,19 August 1999
