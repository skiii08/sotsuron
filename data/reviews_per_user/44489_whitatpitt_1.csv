Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat
","Funny, funny, funny. A little touchy at times but if you are an open person you will laugh and let it roll of your shoulders. Saw this at a premiere last night and I sat next to women in their 40s who seemed to think it was stupid and wanted to leave.....they were WRONG! I loved it and cant wait for everyone to see it....Borat takes it over the top a lot but says what a lot of people are thinking and def. breaks movie boundaries. Just a typical funny as anything Borat movie. I like how the movie actually had a nice story line in a similar journey that many American men take. Although it is rated R some people may still be offended but its great anyway! I am going to see it again when it comes out!",10,5,17,27 October 2006
