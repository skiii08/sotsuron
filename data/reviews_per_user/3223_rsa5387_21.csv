National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Disney, What Happened To You?
","More garbage from Disney? Ridiculous and illogical, the execs at Disney probably thought that the more outlandish they made this film the smarter it would feel. This film does not make an ounce of sense! Not the premise, nor the way the characters behave, the world they inhab...(read more) it, or any part of the story. What the hell happened to you Mr. Cage? Did you even read the script for this one, or the former, or any of those terrible films you starred in last year? Guess you were too distracted by the mountains of cash that were dumped on your mansion. Anyhow, this film is absolutely inane. Most of the history on display here is either false or unbelievable. The only positives I can think of are some of the action sequences, and even those felt contrived and boring, and the acting by Jon Voight and Helen Mirren, their banter was hilarious. Overall, I would say just watch a real adventure movie over this garbage. At least Indiana Jones does not totally insult your intelligence.",3,1,2,17 August 2008
Public Enemies," Ultimately Underwhelming
","On one end of the spectrum, Public Enemies is embellished with great performances by its cast, especially Johnny Depp and Billy Crudup. It's also immensely mounted, with an extremely well designed 1930's era Chicago. The clothing, cars, weapons, and accents are all very accurate, as is to be expected with a big-budget period film. The narrative is also captivatingly woven, showing Dillinger's latter crime career, including his relationship with Billie Frechette, and eventual downfall including his eventual capture by the FBI.So, while the film certainly had an adequate cast, budget, and script at hand, in the end a lot of it felt underdeveloped. Dillinger and Billie's relationship could have been fleshed out a bit more, and there should have been a few more scenes between Dillinger and Purvis. Both of these were needed in order to create more emotional depth for these characters, particularly to rationalize the actions of both Dillinger and Purvis, in order to make them viable for the audience to care about. As it stands, Public Enemies wasn't lacking in depth for Dillinger, as the majority of the film focuses on him, but Purvis was seriously under-written. His character was under-developed to such an extent that Bale's performance appeared to flounder in comparison to Depp, as Purvis wasn't lended a personality that made the audience empathize with his intentions. Puvis's lack of character development also left much suspense out the picture, an aspect that worked to nerve-wracking results in Mann's Heat, as both DeNiro and Pacino were very well-developed, and possessed far more dialogue exchange than the solitary scene Depp and Bale share in this film. Other faults that hurt the film was the uneven editing and the use of digital cameras instead of traditional 35mm film. The editing for Public Enemies disrupted the flow of the film, as certain scenes were either extended too long or cut so suddenly that pacing felt awkward at some points. Moreover, the use of digital film was not a good choice in shooting a period film. A few scenes, the shootouts especially, are 'cheap' looking, meaning that the realistic shooting style made much of this big-budget film look like it was shot for television or as a documentary, removing much of the scale it would have had on 35mm.In the end, Public Enemies is a well-acted, stylishly mounted, enjoyable biopic that falters a little due to its underdeveloped characters, uneven editing, and awkward shooting style. But, in essence, its positives far outweigh its negatives, with some outstanding sequences, especially the climax, well-written dialogue, strong performances, and authentic art direction.",7,4,6,11 August 2009
Terminator Salvation," Terminator Lacks Soul
","Aside from some jaw-dropping visual effects and production design (sound, robots), T4 felt like it lacked any real significance, meandering from one action sequence to the next in-between lines of clich√©d dialogue. Regardless, the acting was quite good, with Bale coming off as the only real disappointment. Usually an outstanding character actor, his character here really didn't have any development beyond being John Connor, leader of the resistance. As such, he was in 'Batman' mode throughout the the entire film, with dialogue mainly consisting of screaming, often incoherently. On the other hand, Sam Worthington was a real surprise, delivering an incredible performance as Marcus Wright. He saved the film, adding the only real touch of depth and emotion to an otherwise hollow, unengaging plot. Overall, while I can't fault McG's direction, if T4 had spent some more time in the scripting department, maybe we would have gotten something beyond a drearier version of The Matrix Reloaded. Disappointing.",7,2,3,25 May 2009
My Neighbor Totoro," Essential Viewing
","I was initially skeptical on the quality of this one, but surprisingly this film was both engaging and beautiful from start to finish. Loosely based on Miyazakis own childhood, My Neighbor Totoro is a simplistic story with a kind of charm, depth, and broad appeal that makes it irresistible. When two girls move to a new farmhouse to be closer to their ailing mother, they have to deal with some of life's more eccentric experiences, that of impending death and incredible magic. At its heart, its about the uninhibited curiosity of childhood, and the innocence in accepting everything without question, to such an extent that magic is a very real reality. The otherworldly in this film, comes in the form of Totoro, an animal spirit who is the guardian of the forest near the girls home. Overall, this film is absolutely spectacular. Kids will love it, though some of the deeper meaning will be lost on them. Adults will also love it, as a nostalgic ride through childhood and for some of the more profound themes running throughout the film. Technically, though made in 1988, the animation in this film looks every bit as stunning today. Totoros forest and the many quiet landscape shots are absolutely gorgeous. Disney, eat your heart out. The film is paced slow, letting the film unfurl at a relaxing pace through its scant 86 minute runtime. The lethargic pace, along with Miyazakis expressive camera pans and attention to detail lend the girls discovery of their home/the forest, the famous cat bus scene, and every moment with Totoro a very 360 degree, hypnotic feel. The new English dub is well done without losing much in translation, retaining the witty and lighthearted exchanges from the original. Overall, this films serves as a great introduction into the world of Miyazaki, and remains a timeless classic in its own right. Miyazakis most lighthearted venture also remains his most introspective and grounded work. Even without the whimsicality of Spirited Away and Kikis Delivery Service, this is by far his most engaging and charming film. Essential viewing.",10,6,7,17 August 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Yo Ho Ho-Hum
","This film was disappointing. A half-baked story that took 2/3's of the films runtime to get going, actors sleepwalking through their roles, and an action set-piece climax that is as uninvolving and boring as the majority of the film. Among the plusse...(read more) s, the films camera-work is stunning, among the highlights is the scenes showing Johnny Depp in Davy Jones locker. You wont see anything that strange and imaginative in a mainstream summer blockbuster this year. The sparse action scenes before the climax are well done, but boring. The cast does a commendable job as a whole, but they don't bring anything new that we haven't seen in the last two movies. Johnny Depp carries the film on his shoulders whenever he appears, too bad he doesn't garner much screen time in the film. Overall, the film is too complicated and takes its self too seriously for its own good. It seemed half-baked compared to the first two's strong story lines, and contained too many characters and subplots. While the 2nd film had some pirate mythology in the form of Davy Jones weaved nicely into the storyline, the third relies far too much on far-fetched pirate history and mythology to carry the plot...so much so that the world the characters inhabit looses its believability as taking place in our world, and the films endless backstories and subplots carried out for the first 2 hours becomes so tedious and boring that you just don't care anymore. The conclusion of the majority of the trilogy's main story lines did not receive enough screen time, and became lost in a pile of underdeveloped subplots. Disappointing...catch it on DVD.",6,1,1,17 August 2008
Cloverfield," Better Than Expected
","Best monster movie ever? This was quite different from the norm as it had the shaky cam perspective...but it was actually done well for once. This view not only made you feel like you were part of the movie, but heightened the suspense quite a bit. I...(read more) loved how they hid the monster for the majority of the movie. Anyhow, after the first excruciatingly boring 20 minutes of drama between some rich kids, this film really takes off and never lets go. The effects are first rate (the crowd shots are amazing...especially the bridge scene...the monster is terrifying). The acting was believable, but the characters could've been written more plausibly...a lot of the decisions they made were totally illogical...but they grow on you and aren't as dumb as most horror movie characters. Overall, this film gets high marks for its no nonsense attempt at the monster genre within a context that felt chillingly real. A must watch!",8,0,1,17 August 2008
Watchmen," Good Adaption...Brilliant Film
","An adaptation of a highly influential graphic novel, touted as the best of all time, certainly has a lofty set of expectations to meet when being adapted into a film. Whether it is an inferior product to the novel is debatable, in any case, Zack Snyder mostly succeeds in adapting Watchmen into an incredibly daring, thought-provoking, entertaining film. Turning the traditional superhero story on its head, it's one of those rare comic-book translations that diverts from merely an entertaining action movie into a real piece of cinema. The acting, dialogue, and cinematography are outstanding. The dialogue, especially, hits all the right notes. While the best are certainly reserved for Rorschach and Dr. Manhattan, the rest of the cast get their bits with some hard-hitting dialogue of their own. The exceptional acting, especially by Walter Kovacs (Rorschach), Billy Crudup (Dr. Manhattan), and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (The Comedian) create the believability the exceptional dialogue needs to make an impact on the audience. When the backstories of the main characters were developed, and the main plot of the film finally began to take it's course, Watchmen had already succeeded in having the depth and resonance of a dozen other films. While it's not an all-time masterpiece, not a moment of its nearly 3-hour runtime is wasted. Every scene serves a purpose to advance the plot, and nearly every dialogue has substantial meaning. The flashbacks with the Comedian, Dr. Manhattan and Rorschach's backstories, the Mars scenes, and Rorschach's monologues are the most resonating. Even the opening credits are exceptionally crafted, summarizing 50 years of an 'altered' American history. In the end, it's hard to describe how well-made this film is, you can tell that every frame was a labor of love. At some points, however, you could also tell where studio execs tampered with the film to make it more appealing to the masses. Nevertheless, that risky, meaningful big-budget films such as The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button and Watchmen exist at all show that mainstream cinema has the ability to be the best of both worlds, pieces of entertainment that also stimulate us to think and question. Those are the real blockbusters.",9,1,3,29 July 2009
The Shining," Lost In Translation
","Kubrick lost the plot on this one. The film left out many important details from the novel, hence making Shining lose much of its psychological impact. It fails to get under your skin as the novel does. Elsewhere, beyond Kubrick's half-baked script...his direction is flawless. Notably, the opening credits, the wide follow sho...(read more) ts of the hotel interior, the 'blood' scenes, the ballroom/bar sequences, jacks fury, and the maze chase are masterful . The film is beautifully shot...the hotel looks both inciting and forbidding. The score is memorable. Performances by the cast is commendable. Of particular note is the boy who plays Danny and Scatman Crothers as Mr. Ullman. The mothers performance is effective enough to induce sympathy from the audience. Elsewhere, Jack Nicholson is brilliant in one of his most recognizable roles. He is both hilarious and terrifying at the same time. Overall, The Shining is a decent adaption that is pulled down by its unfaithfulness to its source material. Though its not a Kubrick masterpiece, the film is worth seeing for Nicholson's performance and cinematography alone.",7,0,1,17 August 2008
Wanted," Stylishly Vapid
","Fluff held together by overblown action sequences. Though it started out interestingly enough, as it progressed the plot became too far fetched for its own good. Once McAvoy steps into the Fraternity, the film throws all logic out the window and relies on action to advance the narrative. That the script is half-baked only emphasized that the somewhat creative action sequences are the only positive this film has to offer. The acting was a bit better, with Freeman, Jolie, and McAvoy delivering competent yet unimpressive performances. In summary, Wanted was another disappointing summer flick that follows the trend of relying on effects over plot.",4,6,13,6 March 2009
Alice in Wonderland," Not Enough Nonsense
","Alice In Wonderland is quite ordinary, lacking the whimsicality of Carrol's books, and the zaniness of Disney's original 1951 production. Much like last week's Prince Of Persia, in place of an enchanting story, we get a soulless retread of the original, with an overabundance of CGI and little heart. Burton's Wonderland is more akin to an amusement park ride, jaunting from one green screen to the next, setting up one conflict after another. Skipping characterization in favor of nostalgia, Disney takes the blockbuster route, assuming that vague flashbacks and lazy alterations of the original work serve as a plot. The acting is toned down all-around, with Carrol's characters losing their carefree madness in favor of innocence. Depp's Hatter disappoints the most. He comes off as weak and sullen, when he should be as his name suggests, mad. The 'futterwacken' scene is an abomination. Bonhan-Carter fares the best, but her character comes off as foolish rather than conniving. Alice is a disappointment, suffering amnesia throughout the film to avert from her lack of characterization. We never get to spend too much time with Carroll's memorable side-characters, as Alice is reduced to simply being a tool that propagates our nostalgia, not interests our curiosity. On a positive note, The Cheshire Cat and Caterpillar were very well done. Overall, in interpreting this work to a new-generation, Burton has emphasized visual splendor, but lacks the storytelling prowess and imagination of Carrol's books. I don't blame Burton, as I am sure Disney had a hand in dumbing-down this film. Taking steps to make it appealing to the widest-audience possible, throwing creativity out for safety of profits, and advancement of 3D-gimmicktry. Much unlike the 1951 film.",5,3,5,5 June 2010
Avatar," Disappointing
","Avatar certainly succeeds in being entertaining, but theirs precious little more here than being well-made 'escapist' fare. While the visual effects are absolutely fantastic, the film lacks an innovative story. From the beginning to end, Avatar is a predictable fare that only sustains on the back of its spectacle. Even encouraging performances by Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana can't cover the films cringe-worthy dialogue, one-dimensional characters, and safe, clich√©d narrative. So while Cameron spent 10 years waiting for technology to improve, and an additional 5 years developing Avatar's effects, what the hell happened to the script? He should have realized that the visual splendor of Pandora could only hide Avatar's lack of heart so long.",6,2,5,25 January 2010
The Last Samurai," This Is Bushido
","One of my favorite movies ever. Its this generations Dancing With Wolves, with a career highlight performance by Tom Cruise, and a heartbreaking story that shows how the majority of today's nations have forgotten their culture in the process of adhering to industrialization and mass commercialism. Among the films trump cards is the absolutely beautiful score by Hans Zimmer. It reaches its emotional crescendos at the right moments and manages to uplift the films climax a few notches. The cinematography, set design, and amount of research that has gone into the film should also be applauded. The scene's at Katsumoto's village are the best of the picture, amply supported by the organic feel and stunning camera-work of its surroundings. The film's more quiet, poetic moments with Cruise's Soliloquy's are also brilliant. Lastly, Ken Wantanabe is excellent as Kasumoto and nearly overshadows Tom Cruise in a number of scenes they have together. Timothy Spall is noteworthy, as usual, in a supporting role. All in all, this is a wonderful film that I can recommend to anybody.",9,0,1,17 August 2008
Up," Creative, unique, engrossing...and somewhat disappointing
","While I didn't find this nearly as impressive as Ratatouille or Wall-E, Up was still a quality Pixar product, and a creative, if slightly pandering animated film. The animation, as to be expected, was stunning. The character design and ballooning portions of the film were exceptionally crafted. The story, however, was lacking. The first 30 minutes were perfect, exuding a level of maturity I didn't expect from a Pixar film. With minimal dialogue, the expressive cinematography was emotionally effective, reminiscent of the best moments in the nearly silent Wall E. The summation of Carl's life with his wife was absolutely beautiful. It is truly one of Pixar's finest moments, and one of the best scenes of 2009 thus far. Once Carl's journey got underway, however, the film took on a far younger sophistication, with cutesy side-characters and inane slapstick moments thrown in to keep younger audiences awake. Kevin the bird was especially annoying. On the other hand, the dogs were hilarious and creatively crafted, garnering some of the best moments in the film. Overall, I thought UP was an enjoyable, if somewhat underwhelming film that could have been so much more if it didn't noticeably pander to younger audiences. Even so, Pixar's heart is always in the right place.",8,1,2,12 June 2009
Departures," Certainly A Departure
","A meditation on death that's startlingly different from a plethora of similar films on the subject. Daigo, a cellist in an orchestra, loses his job after its dissimilation. Fate forces him to move back to his hometown and eventually take a job as a mortician. As Daigo grows to respect the noble work that so many shun, he is forced to confront the past in the form of his father, who abandoned him as a child, and the growing disdain of his wife on the job he has taken up. Everything about this film is masterfully done. From the taut script, which allows the camera to convey much of the dialogue, to the remarkable understated performances by the cast, and Joe Hiasishi's silently swelling score¬Öevery element falls into place perfectly. The subject matter is handled with the utmost care, careful to be tasteful and not too serious or light. Even so, Departures managed to make me smile, think, and cry at relative intervals. At its core, it's a film with a universal message, that says: Mistakes, human differences, and even death should be embraced rather than scowled upon. Because really, aren't we all hurtling towards the same ultimate destiny? Memories are easily altered or forgotten¬Öit's the moments that are precious, in every lifetime, from this one to the next.",10,1,3,12 June 2009
There Will Be Blood," Uneven
","I have mixed feeling for this one. The first act starts off brilliantly, showing Daniel Plainview's (Daniel Day Lewis) plight in finding and extracting oil, a brilliant 15 minutes, sans dialogue! Once Plainview does speak, we do not like him. A truly...(read more) sinister person, his greed for money and power is driven by his hatred for others. He is willing to manipulate anyone to gain what he desires, and he does. Once Plainview learns of the oil rich land in Little Boston, California, the rest of the film is devoted to Plainviews manipulation of the townspeople, his battles with an evangelical preacher Eli Sunday (played brilliantly by Paul Dano), his alienation from his family, and eventual downfall into a bizarre third act. With that being said, this film is very uneven. Though I found the 1st and 3rd acts to be wonderful, with the latter being a bit strange, the 2nd act was far too slow. From Plainviews arrival in Little Boston, up until the last 20 minutes, there was far too much filler in those 90 or so in between minutes. Sure, there were a lot of absolutely brilliant moments, and some jaw-dropping amazingly perfect dialogue (Plainview is very quotable), but a lot of those 90 minutes drag. The film could have easily been cut by 30 minutes. The whole side plot with Plainview's brother from another mother felt contrived and a bit unnecessary. Moreover, Plainview's battle with Eli Sunday felt very undeveloped. On the other hand, the films main story about Plainview's rise and the effect it has on both him and his family is brilliantly done. The film would have benefited from devoting as much screen time fleshing out the secondary characters in the story, especially Eli Sunday's character, than the ending would have been more coherent. Aside from that, I though the film was wonderful. The story was interesting, the dialogue was absolutely brilliant, and the cinematography was at times, mesmerizingly beautiful. The wide landscape shots and oil drilling scenes are highlights. Jonny Greenwoods (Radioheads lead guitarist) score is creepy and tension filled, it complimented the eerie edgy tone of the film wonderfully. Overall, I would have to say this is a flawed masterpiece, its a film of many brilliant moments interlaced with some pacing and characterization issues. If the characters were fleshed out a little more, and the film spent a little more time in the editing room, I would say it was perfect.",8,0,3,17 August 2008
Hancock," Hancock falls short
","Well, what too say about this one. An interesting premise to be sure, but it suffers from a poor 2nd half. The 1st half was very well done, both funny and believable, but once the dramatics started up in the 2nd half, with Hancock's backstory and twist, it became ridiculous. While the backstory was somewhat tolerable, the twist was not very well done. It felt incomplete and rushed like the writers wanted to do something far more with the story but they had ran out of ideas/time and decided to slap something on at the end. Once again, Will Smith is well, Will Smith. While he does a commendable job as always, much like his last venture, I Am Legend, he is once again letdown by an under developed script. Overall, Hancock wasn't a terrible film by any means, but it could have been so much more than what it ended up being, another mediocre superhero film.",6,1,3,17 August 2008
WALL¬∑E," Spellbinding
","Another great effort from Pixar, though it does not scale the heights of last years Ratatouille, its still a commendable effort that deserves the highest praise for its imagination and sheer bravery. With a plot that is far beyond the scope of normal...(read more) kiddie fare, very little dialogue, and an absence of cute fuzzy creatures, Wall-E succeeds due to the strong characterization of its protagonist (sans dialogue), a wholly believable plot that does not drag, and its stunning animation (the beginning shots of Earth, the trip into space, and the robots on the ship being highlights). If theirs one flaw, I would say the film is far too preachy. Though its intentions are noble, the message becomes jarring in the 2nd act, and its ending left me with more questions than answers. Like, what are they going to do now? So what if one plant was salvaged, it does not mean Earth is once again ripe for sustaining life. Those small criticisms aside, I thought Wall-E was not brilliant, but was another enjoyable Pixar product with something profound to say, and once again proves that animation is not just for the kiddos.",9,1,3,17 August 2008
The Dark Knight Rises," Bane Rises
","Christopher Nolan's Batman films have both surprised & disappointed me. On one-hand, Nolan has strived to ground the mythos into as realistic and relatable setting as possible. Given the suspension of disbelief needed for most of these comic book adaptations, the change was risky and admirable. However, along the way, specifically with the second film 'The Dark Knight', Nolan's realistic setting is at odds with increasingly implausible and fantastical happenings. This sense of imbalance carries over to the bloated & meandering final film.'Rises' spends the greater part of its nearly three-hour runtime in escalation, introducing plot lines & characters that serve too embellish a sense of importance & complexity too the proceedings. The main issue with the film is that the majority of the multiple plot lines are poorly executed and unnecessary. For example, while the character played by Anne Hathaway adds a touch of much needed sarcasm & sensuality to the overtly serious proceedings, her motivations & actions are never explained.On the other hand, the characters of Bane & John Blake were well-etched and save the film from outright mediocrity. Bane is equal parts fascinating & menacing, with a convincingly crafted back story that forms the emotional core of the film. Whereas the Joker is the titular villain in the Batman mythos, he is ultimately an absurd character that lacked development & conviction in the previous film. While I never viewed Joker as a legitimate threat in the previous film, Bane's actions are well-plotted & he challenges Batman accordingly. However, both characters actions are ultimately unrealistic, resulting in a film that is neither crime drama nor superhero fantasy.John Blake is the only other character in the film that is well-etched. Unlike Lt. Gordon, Lucius Fox, & Alfred, Blake rises above being mere plot device & garners genuine emotion through a well-developed back story, realistic staging, & strong motivations/actions. As it stands, I found Gordon-Levitt's Blake a far more convincing & interesting character than anything Nolan has written for Bruce Wayne since the end of the first film.Thus lies the main problem with 'Rises', Bruce Wayne & his Batman alter-ego come off as emotionally stilted & reactionary rather than mature & intelligent. This is most likely based on the poor narrative in the previous film, where I had trouble buying into Wayne's relationships & Batman's fall from grace. The character has simply failed to develop since the first film.It's not helping that the films script & technical aspects are also poorly manipulated. While Nolan's script for Begins was generally competent, it's still hard to digest moments of thought-provoking dialog intermixed with sophomoric dramatization, & cheesy one-liners.While a few scenes stood out in this film, particularly in the beginning sequence & Bane's prison, the cinematography on display lacked any sort of flourish, reveling in gritty skylines & explosions over any sort of interesting composition. The action sequences are admirable, if not poorly shot. Sound editing & mixing are first-rate. The score by Hans Zimmer is abysmal.Overall, The Dark Knight Rises is a film that falters due to a weak foundation. 'Rises' ambition & scope are grand, however, it's setting and characters lack development and conviction, ultimately rendering much of the proceedings hollow & self-important. As summer entertainment, Dark Knight rises is the best of the bunch, a gem amongst a sea of nameless sequels, testosterone driven action films, regressive family fare, & tasteless comedies. As a film, however, 'Rises' has no reason to exist, it stands tall amongst such relevant masterworks as 'Avatar' & 'The Matrix'.Stay for the taut & thrilling opening sequence that introduces Bane's character, than fast-forward through the rest.",6,7,15,22 July 2012

Am√©lie," Captivating
","A simple, yet unique, quirky, and spontaneous film full of hilariously flawed 'human' characters, clever dialogue, dazzling cinematography, and a poignant story that encourages one to bask in life's simple pleasures, not taking a moment for granted, and above all¬Ötaking chances. It's with the latter that we all seem to have some learned societal trait to avoid taking said risks, in being different, rather pushed to assimilate, masquerading our idiosyncrasies and seeing being unique or 'weird' as a flaw. In this respect, Amelie is an unusual fairytale that uses its oddly charming story and cast of quirky characters to deliver a charming and ultimately uplifting film brimming with a child-like splendor, full of an unmitigated aspiration to view the world through a technicolor lens, one of pure enchantment. A definite re-watch.",10,1,5,19 May 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Boyle Triumphs
","The power of education, money, and technology pales in comparison to the strength that an individual can attain through the force of love. An eye-opening, heart-wrenching, pulse-pounding film on so many levels, Danny Boyles Slumdog Millionaire is a brave and novel attempt that both entertains and informs. The film is very novel in the fact that its main story centers around a poverty-stricken boy who ends up on the Indian version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. As he escalates closer and closer to the top prize of Rs. 20,000,000, the producers think hes a cheat and he cant believe whats happening either as every question somehow relates to an incident in his life. Though the plot initially sounded far-fetched, it unraveled in such a fast-paced and carefully crafted manner that by the end I was on the edge of my seat rooting for Jamal to win that prize, and realize his dreams. Presented in a series of flashbacks, most of the narrative is spend chasing our protagonist throughout India, from the slums of Mumbai to the steps of the Taj Mahal, as he struggles to live in a world that is seemingly against him at every turn. The only shimmering light in this boys life, and the reason he is on the show, is to find the love of his life, a girl named Latika. Though how he manages to find and lose her throughout his life was absolutely heartbreaking, it also helped shape the subsequent events that help him answer the questions on the show. Therefore the film informs through the exploration of three subjects: Depicting the harsh reality of poverty in modern-day India, the ethereal force of love that rings with total purity and absolute selflessness, and the role destiny plays in ones life. Its a very harsh, realistic film while also having elements of a fairytale, ala having an underdog rise to the top. Its very well acted, with the child actors who play the young versions of Jamal, Salim, and Latika leaving the largest impression. Even their adult counterparts and the supporting players including Bollywood stars Anil Kapoor and Irrfan Khan lend natural, engaging performances. Moreover, its gorgeously shot, edited with aplomb, and has a score thats both haunting and irresistibly catchy. In summary, walking out of this one, I felt absolutely floored at the power and beauty of Slumdog Millionaire. This is definitely one that cannot be missed.",10,2,5,4 January 2009
