Source Code," Expected too much
","Maybe it's just because I was tired, cranky and my date cancelled (bummer), but I thought Source Code was nowhere near as good as Moon, Duncan Jones' debut. Sure, it's an interesting premise, and Jake Gyllenhaal finally proves he can stand his ground as a lead in an action feature, but it had to deal with a bit of a credibility problem. Also, as I have a bit of a 'celeb crush' on her, I think Vera Farmiga's character came across slightly underdeveloped; you just didn't get to know anything about her. But yeah, great visuals, good camera work. Not a bad sophomore effort, but it did have some big shoes to fill. I'll rewatch it in a better mood.",7,1,1,19 May 2011
Inglourious Basterds," QT's glourious return to form
","This is truly a great movie, celebrating everything that's wonderful about cinema. Granted, although it isn't anywhere near as brilliant as Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, Inglourious Basterds hits Tarantino's recent full-blown or half misfires like Death Proof (boring dialogue, uninteresting characters) and Kill Bill (fun, but annoyingly superficial) right out of the park, and rejuvenates this once-great director's career.No need for nitpicking about the blatant historic inaccuracies, since this is just sheer good fun - made abundantly clear by the first chapter's title, 'Once Upon a Time... in Nazi-occupied France' -, with Christoph Waltz as an inspired nazi villain, Brad Pitt's laughable Tennessee accent providing comic relief, and great, highly convincing female performances by MÃ©lanie Laurent and Diane Kruger, rekindling memories of the leading ladies of cinema's golden age.Furthermore, making the characters speak in their native tongues was a bold - Americans are known for disliking subtitles, especially in a 'talky' movie like this one - , but refreshing move, certainly after having to sit through 'Shakespeare-English' abominations like, for example, Valkyrie.Combine all of this with an exciting, exceptionally smart storyline and a fantastic, at times anachronistic soundtrack (especially Bowie's 'Cat People' is put to good use), and what you've got is a highly entertaining two-and-a-half hour thrill ride.So, in short: welcome back, QT!",9,2,10,19 August 2009
Psycho," Visually impressive, but doesn't hold up.
","While I know I'll anger a lot of thriller fans, here's my two cents: this is one of the least enjoyable Hitchcock classics. To clarify: if you compare Psycho to North by Northwest, Strangers on a Train, Vertigo or Rebecca, I can't see how any self-proclaimed film fan wouldn't conclude that it falls considerably short. Even other Hitch classics I don't particularly love or hate (such as The Birds, Rear Window or Marnie) trigger a wider emotional response than the pretty simplistic shock effects which are all Psycho has to offer. Of course there's some great cinematography, but it isn't backed by any involving factors other than sheer horror, or the kind of hammy pseudo-psychology Hitchcock already tried his hand on in Spellbound.My reasonably kind rating of seven out of ten is mostly motivated by its historical importance - even if you take into account that Peeping Tom, which I think is a far superior film with a similar theme, relentlessly flopped earlier in the same year - as it opened the mainstream public's eyes regarding the horror/thriller genre. But if you've seen Psycho once (which, in fact, any film fanatic should), to me there's no real reason to watch it again.",7,1,2,27 November 2010
Joker," Derivative, too long, and nothing substantial to say.
","There's a load of references in there, which they show over and over again; the starting point isn't smart, so repeating it incessantly isn't either. Phoenix is amazing, as are a lot of the other cast members, but they can't save a lazy, derivative, predictable screenplay from failing. Also, regarding the soundtrack, they could've used a lot of era-appropriate and psychologically fitting new wave or punk, but instead they keep on copying Bernard Herrmann (taxi driver, don'tcha know) and using the same two Sinatra songs repeatedly. And it takes waaaay too long, treating the audience like toddlers. Yeah, i get it already. 6/10, purely for the performances and cinematography. The rest of it sucks.",6,1,2,12 November 2019
Slumdog Millionaire," No Top 250 material.
","Overly sentimental, anything but credible and ridiculously over-hyped, this petty excuse of a movie managed to reel in a multitude of Oscars. I have to admit I wasn't exactly bored while watching it, but a second viewing just isn't going to happen.The storyline's a wash - to name just one inconsistency, as Salman Rushdie pointed out: from Bombay to the Taj Mahal by jumping a train? Really? -, the actors don't bring anything truly endearing or sympathetic to their characters, and the 'award-winning' music is more often a nuisance than an extra to the whole movie-going experience. Don't get me wrong: I love M.I.A., for instance, but for the biggest part it just didn't work for me.In fact, the only virtues of this film are the often astonishing landscapes, the energetic, yet dynamic camera work and the rhythmic, punctual direction. But you simply cannot make a good movie out of those three elements - except if you wanna go all 'Koyaanisqatsi', which I love. But they didn't.Hence: six out of ten.P.S.: To be completely honest, I would probably rate this a seven, seven and a half tops if it weren't for the suffocating hype surrounding the film, but I feel like bringing the overall score down a notch in my own humble way, because 'Slumdog' simply doesn't deserve such a high rating. I mean: Top 250? No.Let's just wait and see who will remember this film in three to five years' time.",6,8,11,1 April 2009
