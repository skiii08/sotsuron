Requiem for a Dream," Not For Me. I'll Stick with Pi
","I enjoyed the previous effort by Requiem's directory Darren Aronofsky, Pi, but this one didn't work for me.  The subject matter is interesting enough (I loved 'Traffic'), but the out-of-control direction and annoying camera angles overwhelmed the plot and the acting.  There weren't enough scenes over a few seconds for me to even get a flavor for what was going on within the actors.  Those emotions were supposed to have been communicated through the visual medium rather that dialog, however I found it to be ineffective.  It's a shame.  I am a fan of Jennifer Connelly since seeing her in Once Upon a Time in America.  I think Jared Leto is a fine actor, but again, I couldn't tell from this movie.At age 41, perhaps I just haven't watched enough MTV to follow manic cinematography.I felt the ending was cheesy and pandering, so it didn't carry the emotional power that was intended, either.",4,9,18,2 July 2001
Friday Night Lights," 'Over the Top' Directing Detracts Strongly
","I rented this movie primarily on the strengths of Billy Bob Thornton. I think he takes on consistently good roles. This movie had a lot to offer in terms of plot. Rural Texas is big on football, often more so than on academics. The plot point came out in the movie, but seemed to be glossed over to a large degree.One of the subplots also deals with the relationship between a father, a past high school football champ, and his son who has the opportunity to become a state champ. It is a contentious relationship, but the movie failed to explore that relationship beyond a superficial level.Perhaps the greatest distraction in this film is the awful directing by Peter Berg of the football action sequences. They were very unrealistic and 'over the top' so that they seemed more like a John Madden video game than a high school football game.The acting was good and the plot was sufficient to prevent this from being a truly horrible film. If you are a sports movie fan, there is a likelihood that you will like this movie much better than I did. However, I was expecting a little more realism and a little more character depth than I saw in this movie.",5,13,27,24 May 2005
Monster," Charlize Theron's Tour De Force
","This is a wonderful portrayal of an interesting story.  Female serial killers are rare and the plot does a good job of a balanced portrayal of a complex woman.  It avoids the obvious ultra-liberal position that Aileen Wournos was a martyr of her upbringing.  Instead, we see a woman capable of compassion, but also capable of being a monster.  Kudos to the scriptwriter for walking such a fine line.A lot has been said of Charlize Theron's DeNiro-esque change in body structure for the sake of cinema, so there is nothing that I can add except that I agree.The direction was as it should be - unobtrusive.  The camera work did a good job of exuding emotion without being overly obvious about it.  Nice job!",7,1,2,5 June 2004
Passengers," Solid Execution on a Trite Storyline
","There is a lot of positive in this movie, but unfortunately, it fails to deliver overall.There are few cast members with any screen time. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt have to deliver and they do. The acting is solid. The special effects and cinematography are also well-done.For a movie to be good, a lot as to fall in place. In this case, the plot fails to deliver. I've seen a LOT of movies, and there was nothing original here. The story arc is exactly what we would expect. As a lifelong technician, there were some eye-rolling moments on the technical aspects of the storytelling as well.It's not a bad movie, but it is uninspired. With so much to chose from, I should have chosen another way to spend my time.",5,1,3,1 October 2018
The Notebook," Unabashedly Romantic and Sentimental. It's Storytelling at its Best
","This story plays out as Duke, played by James Garner, reads a story about two young people in the 1940s who fall in love and endure life. The movie moves between present-day and the 1940s. It is structurally very similar to 'Fried Green Tomatoes', which is also one of my all time favorite movies.Unlike 'Fried Green Tomatoes', this focuses on young love as it grows and endures through wars and parental dissent. Sure, the core is the 'Romeo and Juilet' theme, but the way is plays out and the exceptional charisma that the actors bring to the screen make it feel fresh and not entirely predictable. This is a deeply romantic movie. If you are cynical at all about romance, timeless love and dedication to another person, you may find yourself rolling your eyes a bit. I am not that cynical about the emotional ties that bind us and I was thoroughly taken in by the story.This is such a gentle movie. The characters are very human and very likable. All of the actors turn in engrossing and compelling performances.Technically, this movie is exceptional, too. The scenes during the opening credits is absolutely breathtaking. The editing is very good. The story is compelling from the opening credits to the closing credits.My wife and I don't always share the same perspective on movies, but we agreed on this one. We both loved it immensely. I am certain this will become part of our permanent collection.",10,284,354,26 February 2005
The Danish Girl," A Tour de Force of Acting
","The plot was well done and the cinematography was delightfully elegant, but it is the acting that makes this movie the spectacular work of art that it is.Eddie Redmayne is a gifted actor. I have enjoyed is work in many previous films, but his work here is exceptional. The way he channeled another gender is quite remarkable.Alicia Vikander is also a gifted actress. I have not seen such an expressive face since Juliette Binoche. Her subdued emotions are reflected in her face in a manner that engages the audience and draws out an empathetic reaction.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.",9,0,1,10 December 2016
Troy," Ostentatious Garbage
","This is an epic picture. There isn't a moment in this movie where the director, actors, writer or the musical score let you forget it. Sadly, it a very poor epic. The dialog is pretentious posturing and war-mongering. Many times in the movie, our great, god-like hero, Brad Pitt, speaks and the crowd cheers. Utter garbage.There are wholly implausible moments in a movie that is attempting a very realistic presentation. There is a scene where Brad Pitt lops the head off a gold-plated, stone (or perhaps solid gold) statue like it was made of butter. This can work in a movie that is a fantasy or supernatural epic, but it was inconsistent with the timbre of this movie.The acting from very good actors is consistently bad. I like Brad Pitt. He is an exceptionally talented actor (just see '12 Monkeys' for proof of that). This movie made him look like a pretty-boy B movie actor, which he worked so hard to avoid early in his career.The director of this movie, Wolfgang Peterson, has to take the blame for this. He failed to execute on a very good, well-known story. Even the score of this movie was pompous and intrusive. There is nothing redeeming about this movie. The best part is the special effects, but that is no where close to being sufficient to save this dog.",3,15,33,16 January 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," Poor Script and Direction Finished Crippling a Lame Film
","I figured that this would be primarily a special-effects movie, so I didn't have high expectations. Unfortunately, those expectations weren't met. I had hoped that solid acting by Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal could make this a character-driven action movie. The writing and direction removed any hope of that.When watching the movie, I was surprised to find that the acting of Quaid and Gyllenhaal was quite bad. Since I hold these actors in high regard, I blame the script. It quickly digressed into unimaginably simplistic melodrama. Perhaps the actors had as much problem believing the dialog as I did. For crying out loud, they even threw in a kid with cancer as a whorish attempt to generate some emotion, although it added nothing to the plot.The special effects were exceptional. If that is sufficient for you to enjoy a movie, this is a movie for you. If you require good character development and a creative script as I do, then this movie is likely to fall well short.",4,0,1,12 August 2005
Crash," Wonderfully Nuanced Treatise on Racism
","This is an exceptional film on all levels. Technically it is masterful. The filming is exceptional. The acting is top notch all the way through. There is a lot of very deep, but suppressed emotion, in the acting. There were no weak performances throughout this film. There was one scene that perhaps could have been edited a little more tightly, but that is a genuinely trivial complaint. This film really hit the mark with me.Structurally, this film is very close to 'Short Cuts' by Robert Altman, which is also a favorite of mine. This tells the interwoven stories of an ensemble cast of characters as they face the frustrations of daily living. Racism isn't black and white. Interspersed throughout the film are the multiple nuanced facets of racism in all of their ugly shades of grey. There is no overt KKK-style racism here. It's all about the subtle assumptions that we make of people based on their appearance. Sometimes those assumptions are correct, but wrong. Sometimes they are wrong, but correct.This is a brilliant screenplay. Sure there are some coincidences that are quite unlikely, but they are there to contribute to the point of the stories, so that level of poetic license is quite alright with me. It didn't detract from the message.There are so many wonderful actors and performances in this movie that it is unfair to pick out one out. However, I thought Don Cheadle - whose acting I am always admired - had the best performance of his career. His ability to convey emotion through expression was just plain exceptional.It takes a truly exceptional movie to impress me enough to earn a 10 of 10. This is just such a movie.",10,5,12,8 September 2005
Southpaw," They Doubled-Down on Dumb
","This movie has some positive aspects. Jake Gyllenhaal and Rachel McAdams put in their typical, exceptional acting performances. Other technical aspects of the movie - direction and cinematography - are well done, but not exceptional. These elements aren't easy to achieve. It's hard to make a good movie, because ALL of the aspects of the film have to come together.In this case, the plot was formulaic and not a single dumb melodramatic trope was left out. (Oh, I guess no one got cancer, so they mercilessly left out one manipulative trope).This plot is just a pathetic, unoriginal manipulation of the audience. As a lover of good movies, I expect more.",4,0,3,25 November 2018
The Aviator," Well Done in all Aspects
","This is a very well done movie. Technically, the movie was exceptional. Leonardo DiCaprio is a phenomenal actor. It's a shame that he got temporarily slotted as a teen idol after 'Titanic'. His performance is very well done. It would have been easy to go over the top in portraying the mental illness that Howard Hughes suffered from. Instead it was played with humanity and compassion.The direction was also well done, as one would expect from Scorsese. There are a couple of action scenes that appeared to be exceptionally difficult from a technical point-of-view that were absolutely stunning. The pace of the movie is perfect. At 2:50, one would expect some sags, but it kept my interest for the duration.The plot was also quite interesting. I knew a considerable amount about Howard Hughes before watching this movie, but this filled in some gaps a details and placed these events in a historical context.Howard Hughes led a complex and interesting life. This movie brings that to us in a very compelling way.",8,0,2,9 July 2005
Doctor Zhivago," One of the Greatest Cinematic Works
","This movie has it all.The plot plays out on the backdrop of the Russian revolution, a fascinating event in world history.  The contrast in the life of Yuri (Omar Sharif) before and after the revolution is profound. The love story between Yuri and Lara is the central plot.  It is deeply romantic and evolves in an entirely believable way.The art of this film is wonderful.  The cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen and is worthy of the Oscar it received.The acting is great.",10,0,1,28 March 2001
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Not Generally My Kind of Movie, but It Works
","I tend to be drawn to character and plot-driven dramas. The sophomoric sex humor movie doesn't generally appeal to me. My 16 year-old wanted to see this and I thought that there might me a laugh or two.There were many more laughs than that. I was laughing from the first scene to the goofy end. I haven't laughed that much since 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'.I can't really say there was a lot of depth to the characters, but they weren't superficial clichés, either. Each character contributed to the setup for the nearly continuous set of very funny lines. The writing is really exceptional. Of course, the jokes are essentially sex humor, but they are exceptionally and unexpectedly witty... and darn funny.There's not a lot of surprise in the plot, of course. The movie doesn't spend a lot of time trying to interject drama into what is unabashedly a comedy. That's a good thing. This is an great way to spend a couple of hours with some quite funny sexually oriented humor.",8,1,3,1 October 2005
The Butterfly Effect," Fascinating Plot Idea that is Well Acted
","I have always enjoyed movies that center around time-travel.  While this isn't a time travel movie per se, it is similar in that the Evan Treborn character (Ashton Kutcher) learns that he can alter the past.  These changes create a ripple effect throughout the intervening years.  Some of the results are positive and anticipated.  Others are unexpected and unfortunate.  The plot is intelligent and gives the audience a chance to reflect on the notion that many defining moments in life are a result of happenstance.The direction and editing are done in such a way that we can keep track of the changes that result from the alteration in the past.  That is difficult to do in a movie of this nature, but I had no problem following the time transitions.The actors did a fine job. Aston Kutcher, an actor for whom I didn't have a lot of regard, showed me that he really could act with some depth. I also enjoyed Amy Smart's performance.I had moderate expectations for this movie and those expectations were exceeded by a significant amount.  I recommend this film.",8,0,3,15 August 2004
The Pianist," A Depressingly Real, Wonderful Movie
","This is not a 'feel good' movie.  The story of survival in war-torn Europe makes for a good plot and has been done many times.  This movie has to stand out as one of the best.  The acting is exceptional all the way through, especially by Alan Brody.  The writing is exceptional - and exceptionally accurate - since it is autobiographical.  All of the characters are richly portrayed and richly developed. There was no lazy writing or directing that fell back on stereotypes.It felt like I was there - and man, was that depressing.  I enjoyed this movie from the first frame to the last.",9,1,2,31 July 2003
The Incredibles," Another Good Pixar Film, but not as Great as Others
","It's hard not to like a Pixar movie. I have enjoyed them since I first saw 'Luxo, Jr.' and their other exceptional short films. The animation in Pixar films is extraordinary, but it is the characters that make the movies so enjoyable. Since they are family-oriented, they also have to find the magic that makes the movies entertaining to both adults and children.There are two distinct parts to this movie. In the first part, the Incredible family is trying to live as normal people in society, although they have extraordinary skills. In this part of the movie, the Pixar magic is in full swing. The characters are interesting and the humor is sometimes nuanced and sometimes right down the middle.The second part of the movie is oriented more toward the action and the Incredibles as action heroes. I think this movie is oriented much more toward the kids and I found it to be less interesting.It's still an entertaining movie, but I don't think it is quite up to some of the other Pixar movies such as 'Toy Story'. If you have young kids, it is a good bet. If your kids are grown, as mine are, and you are viewing this with adults, it's still entertaining, but not quite as much of an easy recommendation.",6,1,3,25 April 2005
Coyote Ugly," Formula Hollywood with Eye Candy
",This is one of the classic Hollywood plots.  The girl trying to find herself in the 'big city' and realize her dreams. The conflicts that get in the way have a feeling of being contrived as the writing seemed to be a little lazy.This is an OK movie.  If you are under 25 years old and haven't already seen this plot a dozen times it will be enjoyable.  The girls are attractive and the acting is consistently good.,5,1,1,13 August 2000
Million Dollar Baby," A Powerful and Soulful Movie About Relationships
","Clint Eastwood may be best remembered for the spaghetti westerns and 'Dirty Harry' shoot-em-ups. If so, that is a shame. The past several years ago, he has made some powerful, soulful and reflective movies such as 'Unforgiven.' 'Million Dollar Baby' is the best so far.There is so much depth to the plot and the characters, it is hard to know where to start. It is about relationships - the ones these characters failed, the ones that have been in development for decades and the new ones that are evolving quickly.There are so many ways in which a lesser film maker would have spoiled this movie, but not Clint Eastwood. The power of the ending is not dissipated by melodrama, but comes full force, even though there was enough commentary on the movie that the ending was spoiled for me.The narration by the exceptional Morgan Freeman is icing on a delicious triple-layer cake. This is fine cinema.",10,2,4,18 July 2005
Garden State," Slow Paced, but Time Well Spent
","I wanted to see this movie primarily because I enjoy Natalie Portman's performances. She once again shows that she is a very talented and charismatic actress.I like plot and character-driven movies and this most certainly qualifies. I also like movies with quirky characters. Like 'American Spendor' and 'Accidental Tourist', this has quite a few. The plot is also original and compelling. The main character, played (and written and directed) by Zach Braff, at age 26, is spending his first time without psychotropic drugs. He gets to start living in a world where he feels his emotions. It would be easy to go over the top with that kind of plot idea, but this movie plays it out in a very subtle manner. It is well-written and all of the acting contributions are strong.The only complaint, and it is minor, is that the pace of the movie was a little slow. There was probably a scene or two that could have been eliminated to get us through the movie a little quicker.In all, this is a very enjoyable film. I recommend it to those who like the plot and character-driven movies.",8,0,1,29 January 2005
Mulholland Drive," Ed Wood with a Budget
","This is the worst movie I have seen in a decade.  I tend to like so-called 'art films' and don't have any need for all of the loose ends in a movie to be neatly tied up.  This movie has more loose ends than Davy Crockett's jacket.I have to admit it was creative, but so were the words of my college roommate when he was tripping on LSD.  He too, was creative, but he was neither lucid or entertaining.  I still don't know what this movie (or the LSD trip) was about.The direction was horrible. It looks like the experimentation of a sophomore film student in college. The script makes no sense.  The acting, except for Naomi Watts, is horrid.I wasn't a fan of David Lynch before this movie.  Now, I am all but certain I will never waste time with a David Lynch movie again.  That turkey of a writer/director owes me two hours of my life.",1,60,122,27 April 2002
Mission: Impossible II," Formula Hollywood Movie - Nothing Special Here
","This is a typical Hollywood action yarn with two dimensional characters and a very predictable, very lame plot.  The good guys are great, the bad guys are horrible and the girl needs to be rescued. (Snore).The direction is annoying.  The inappropriate overuse of slow motion in the movie attempts to enhance the drama, but comes across as cheezy.  The film approach and plot (if you can call this a plot) is a ripoff of the James Bond genre.Don't waste your time on this one.  It doesn't even work as escapist fare.",3,0,1,2 January 2001
The Insider," A Good, Intelligent Movie
","This was an interesting movie.  It is enjoyable to watch a movie that respects the audience.  The characters are complex and flawed as you would expect in a portrayal of real people.  This movie is well-written and well-acted.There are a couple of things that detracted from the overall quality of the movie.  First, I thought the direction was annoying in a few scenes.  There were some handheld shots that were course and jittery.  This did not convey any emotional element of the movie to me, but was a mere distraction.  I also read in Brill's Content magazine about the factual errors in the movie. I understand the need for 'dramatic license', but when portraying real events using real names of people who are still alive and still in the line of work portrayed in the movie, I would like to see the content held to a higher standard of accuracy.",8,0,0,30 July 2000
Annie Hall," The Definitive Woody Allen Movie
","I am not a huge fan of Woody Allen and my wife can't hardly stand to watch him. As a result, I have only seen a half-dozen of Woody Allen movies. With the exception of 'Manhattan', I have been unimpressed or felt them to be downright horrible.I have heard so much about 'Annie Hall' that I had to take the time to watch it. It was on HBO in Hi-Definition, so why not? Indeed, this is a wonderful movie. While not a big Diane Keaton fan, it was most certainly the best performance of her career that I have seen. I think the casting was exceptional and she handled the material well.I tend to like to immerse myself in a movie. Woody's use of the aside (talking to the audience), is a little distracting, but the short scene with Marshall McLuhan was a wonderful shot at self-absorbed intellectuals.The plot idea is very good. I think so many of Woody Allen's characters in so many of his movies have been this same character over and over again. I think this is the definitive Woody Allen character. So much of his recent work as been a pale imitation.Even if you aren't a Woody fan, I have to recommend this as a creative piece of comedic cinema.",8,8,14,12 January 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A 'Dark Comedy' with No Comedy
","This was billed as a 'dark comedy', but I failed to find the comedy. There is plenty of 'dark' to go around, but that's OK. I don't mind a serious movie that makes the audience feel some emotion.The direction in this movie is outstanding. There have been many cinematic attempts to create a surreal environment for the viewer. They usually come off like those awful LSD 'trippy' movies from the 1970's. This one got it right. It was clear when Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) was experiencing the progressive memory loss and how surreal that was to him. There is a LOT of interesting things going on in the background of many of the scenes in this movie. It is done without upstaging the events in the foreground, too. Truly outstanding work my Michael Gondry.The acting was well-done, too. Jim Carrey turns in a remarkably depressing performance. Kate Winslet also plays her character extremely well. It is very, very believable even though the subject matter requires the suspension of disbelief.This is my kind of movie. It is character-driven with a deep and innovative plot. The cinematic qualities of the movie are exceptional. What confused me the most was that I didn't like it much.It took me until the next day to realize why the movie left me cold. I didn't like any of the characters. The Jim Carrey character is depressed, lonely and rather pitiful. The Kate Winslet character was a loony. She must have had bipolar disorder or something, because she was not stable. The supporting characters were ethics-free. There was no one in this movie that I cared about. It's a shame, too, because so much is right with this movie.I gave it a 6/10.",6,2,5,2 February 2005
Once Upon a Time in America," Complex and Gripping. The Definitive Gangster Movie
","This is an exceptional movie.  The progression throughout the lives of these people makes for a compelling, well-written movie.  The acting and direction are fantastic.Most people consider 'The Godfather' to be a definitive gangster movie, but I liked this more.  It was a more interesting story and considerably more violent.If you look for this movie, ensure that you get the long version.  The American version cut out several minutes and ordered the story in chronological order.  The long version requires more from the audience to track what is going on, but makes for a more interesting movie.Why isn't this out on DVD!?!",10,7,15,19 November 2000
Saw," Bad Acting and Implausible Plot Makes for Bad Cinema
","I have to admit I am not a big fan of horror flicks. This did nothing to change that basic opinion. The basic plot idea is well worn. A psychopathic killer tortures his victims before killing them. There are enough creative plot points to make this worthwhile for fans of the genre.I felt that the acting was quite poor. I thought the performances by Cary Elwes was over the top. I like Danny Glover as a rule, but his performance was off in this movie as well.The real failure of the movie was the implausible plot. I can suspend disbelief and expect to with horror and sci-fi movies especially. This one went too far for me. Some of the horrors that were rigged up by the mastermind felt more like those from the Riddler or the Joker in the campy 1960's Batman TV series than a contemporary, serious horror movie.Before the movie was over, both my 16 year old and my wife were mocking the script (and I didn't start it!).I think horror fans will enjoy this, but it wasn't my kind of movie.",3,2,5,5 March 2005
The Last Samurai," Technically Good, Formula Hollywood
","This has all of the characteristics of a high-budget, Hollywood production. Tom Cruise does a great job acting the same as most all Tom Cruise parts.The plot was interesting enough. Even if moderately accurate historically, it provides a lesson in America helping those who eventually turn on us.The direction and overall production was as good as one would expect from a high-budget movie. The writing, however, didn't break any new ground or present anything that we haven't seen a hundred other epic Hollywood production.If you like these lavish war stories, this is another great example. Personally, I like the plot-driven movies more.",7,0,3,12 September 2004
The Red Violin," A Finely-Crafted Movie
","This is the story of the soul of a violin, created in the late 1600s.  The story flashes forward to the red violin being sold at auction and back to a period in time where the story of its various owners through the ages is told.As each story is told, the mystique about the violin grows and another group is added to those interested in bidding on the 'holy grail' of violins whese rumored existence becomes a reality.This is an exceptionally good movie.  It excels in all technical aspects of film making.  The plot is very interesting.  I highly recommend this, especially for those of you who, like me, are tired of the Hollywood, predictable 'cookie-cutter' movies.",9,1,1,14 January 2000
The Matrix Reloaded," Self-Important, Incoherent Garbage
","I didn't care much for the first Matrix, but went to see this with my 14-year old.The plot is very hard to follow. The acting is very stilted. Except for the visually-stunning fight scenes, the direction is one-dimensional.I find plot & character to be vital for a movie to be interesting. This cartoon fails at both.",3,0,1,25 December 2003
There Will Be Blood," Meandering Plot Makes for a Boring Movie
","This should have been my kind of movie. I was anticipating a well-acted, plot-driven film with an historical angle and the timeless notion of the greed that drives many people.The movie started out well, albeit a little slow paced. The character development was good and the plot points were relevant. Once the Day-Lewis character achieved a level of stature, the plot started to become incoherent. It meandering along, explaining little in the way of motivation. It lost direction and never found its way. At the end, I just couldn't wait for it to be over.I think Day-Lewis turned in an Oscar-worthy performance, but the entropy of the plot made for a very big disappointment.",4,3,6,30 June 2008
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," Exceptional Filmmaking in All Aspects
","There is so many movies from so many services, but it is still hard to find ones that are outstanding. This is one of them.I am not in the industry, but I have a deep appreciation of how many things have to come together in the right way to create a true work of art.First, the acting in this movie is exceptional. There are quite a few recognizable faces from 'Downton Abbey,' and that's a great place to start for acting talent. Lily James is nothing short of radiant. The direction and cinematography highlight her fine work in bringing this story to the screen.The direction isn't limited to the rich characterization that Lily James brings. It is exceptional throughout. The pathos is apparent, but not melodramatic.The best movies are built on a great story. The story here is exceptional. I put it up there with 'Fried Green Tomatoes.' It unfolds beautifully. It is compelling and engaging.",9,1,2,12 November 2018
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," I Expected Little and Got Less
","I didn't have a lot of hope in this being a particularly good movie. I like Will Ferrell and thought there might be some good laughs in it. Instead of being a witty comedy of words, it is very sophomoric and slapstick. There are a couple of scenes of physical humor that are inappropriately dumb, even in the context of the very dumb dialog.The acting was over the top, probably due to the direction. Christina Applegate delivered the dialog with a sort of over acting that dominated the movies from the 1930's. Will Ferrell was mainly just being Will Ferrell, but also delivered many of the lines with the pomposity of his character.Of course, there is some good humor. I did get some chuckles out of the movie, but I was quite disappointed, even starting with few expectations.",3,0,1,22 July 2005
Ray," It Deserves the Accolades
","So many of the hyped movies fail to live up to their billing. I was afraid that Ray would fall into that category. This is a very good story, very realistically portraying (or so it seems) the life of Ray Charles. It is an excellent story about a gifted and flawed man.I have to admit that I didn't have much respect for Jamie Foxx. After all, 'Bait' and 'Booty Call' just aren't the stuff of good cinema. I was wrong. Jamie Foxx is an exceptional actor. His work is quite outstanding in this movie and the work he did in 'Collateral' proves that it wasn't a fluke.The other elements of this film are top notch as well. The direction is superb and the acting by the supporting cast is very strong. This is an outstanding movie.",9,2,4,1 April 2005
The Terminal," How Could This Be This Good?
","I couldn't understand how a plot about a guy stuck in an airport terminal could be good. I had the same feeling about 'Cast Away' and it turned out to be a good movie. The question was, 'Can Tom Hanks pull it off again?'. The answer is a resounding YES! It works because the characters are so compelling and the stories are so interesting. The plot has plenty of levity, too. It makes a nuanced statement about the absurdity of bureaucracy without going over the top. Mostly, though, it is about the adaptability and resilience of some people.I thought the writing and direction were exceptional. Cinematography was good as well, even though nearly all of the movie was shot indoors. I have one minor complaint. The antagonist in the movie started with some depth and progressed toward more of a two dimensional archetype. It wasn't enough to ruin the movie, though and wasn't to the degree that is could have been.This is a very good movie with exceptional work by the supporting cast. I highly recommend this movie.",8,1,2,12 March 2005
The Bourne Supremacy," Wild Editing Added to the Disappointment
","I am not a huge fan of the action movie genre, but others in the family wanted to see this one and I did enjoy the Bourne Identity.I really had trouble following this movie. Characters appeared on the screen without any context. The editing was horrific. There were very short edits and a lot of spinning whirling camera. If the point was to impart the confusion that our protagonist was feeling, it was successful. However, this lead to a nearly incomprehensible movie. I guess I am just a little bit too old for the MTV, short-attention span approach to video. If I want disorientation, I will do it the old fashioned way and have one to many martinis.The acting (at least what little acting is needed in a film of this type) was good. I like Matt Damon as an actor.I have to admit, the car chase scene was one of the best I have seen in a movie. It beat the heck out of the Bullit chase scene that is so often cited as the definitive car chase.In all, this was a disappoint for me. If you like the action genre, this will likely fit the bill.",5,0,2,9 December 2004
The Island," Absurd in Too Many Ways
","This movie is consistent with the majority of the action flicks being produced by Hollywood. It is so formulaic that writers can write it in their sleep. I am all for suspending disbelief in a science fiction movie, but I don't think we will have the technology in 20 years to create a full-size adult clone in four years that is educated to a high-school level.Somehow Ewan McGregor's character knows how to drive a car and a jet-powered flying motorcycle, even though he has never seen one. Somehow, he knows how to use a credit card and cash.The draw for a movie like this is the special effects. They are spectacular. Absurdly spectacular. Our heroic duo fall 30 stories while helicopters and metal rain down on them. All involved are doomed, except these two. It's pretty nuts.If you are an action movie fan, you will likely enjoy this movie. If you are interested in substantive cinema, this is not your movie fare.",4,2,4,2 September 2006
