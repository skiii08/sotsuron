Spotlight," First
","The whole movie is like an excellent news report itself, stating the ins and outs, introducing characters, looking for evidence, and solving difficulties. Calm and organized, it is said that the real reporter's office and living environment are also restored properly. Of course, in order to maintain this tone, the story of the news itself is weakened, and the personality pf the reporter cannot be deeply shaped.",8,0,0,29 April 2020
The Revenant," Watched several tines

Dunkirk," Frist
","Three story lines, of different lengths, but intentionally edited in parallel, creating an illusion. This time there were not many narrative tricks and no visual wonders. The main thing is to restore the atmosphere of terror and create the despair and tension at that time. There are heroes of substitution is stronger. Music strongly promotes the emotion of the film and makes the ending more relaxed. The glide at the end is really beautiful.",7,0,0,22 April 2020

Frozen," The Best
","In recent years, I have seen the best Disney cartoon. This movie has a very unique perspective, focusing on sisterhood, rather than the traditional Prince and Princess happily together.The characters are deeply portrayed, everyone has a multi-dimensional and unique personality, and the introduction of two female protagonists is unprecedented. The music is definitely Broadway, not for singing. Wonderful ! !",9,1,2,30 March 2020
The Lion King," The theme of kindness is eteral
","I have not seen the animated version of the Lion King movie, so the content in it is all new to me.
I went to the cinema for the first time to see the animals in this movie look good and the music is brilliant. The composition of the entire movie is magnificent and the colors are bright.

1917," First
","Long shots of this level can only be the product of this era. I think he has surpassed the traditional technique of so-called lens movement and scheduling, because from this perspective, it is impossible to realize this long lens. This long shot is simply creating reality. I also have a feeling that the story after the only shot in that movie is cut off becomes a bit surreal. The sun-like flares, the Madonna-like girl in the basement, the river full of corpses, the nostalgic song that soldiers listened to before going to battle, and the rushing in front of the trench. All of this was so dreamy that I doubted whether the protagonist had actually died under the black shot.",8,0,1,29 April 2020

The Artist," Watch silent movies for the first time
","Give the puppy a prize. It is somewhat unfair to compare with classic silent films. After all, the times are different, and the creative mentality and vision have changed. From the current point of view, the highlight of the film is that it is different from others. I am used to seeing blockbuster visuals and lines, and use black and white silent films to change my taste. It is a relaxed and slightly touching love movie.",8,1,1,10 April 2020

12 Years a Slave," Inequality
","What impressed me most was the long shot of the man hanging from the tree, which made me suffocate. This is a clever mainstream move. It hides cruelty in a peaceful and harmonious environment. After watching it, it will make your back cool.

Black Panther," I can't find anything I like
","I think this movie is out of standard, and it is another piece of chess piece with enlarged layout. The action scenes and plot highlights are very limited. Some political ambitions are inserted in the middle, but is actually quite bring.
However, professional judges have rated this film very high, and I may not know the highlights.",6,1,2,9 April 2020
Green Book," Racial Discrimination
","The two men, whose skin color, class, personality and orientation are so different, became acquainted with music and became friends for life became of road trips. Sometimes talent is not enough. It takes courage to push down the wall in my heart to open the door. The film is like a small green pebble, plunged into black and white American society, and stirs up small and beautiful ripples.
