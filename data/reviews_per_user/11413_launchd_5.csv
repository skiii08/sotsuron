Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A lush, Over-due return to a more Heroic Universe
","'SW:TPM' rivals the first flick as my fav- (though the OVER-abundance of whimsical characters makes me almost yetch). And Jar-Jar gets tired. One sequence that has NOT been ballyhooed is tremendous (and...wet). The young Anakin is a bit too young- the kid is barely in the 'kid' age. Young Anakin (Jake Lloyd) is fun to see, but he's too young for a lot of this. There's Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala- she's too weak at times. I had noticed this in the trailers. She simply does not engage my allegiance to fight for her to the death. She does pull off much of the flic though.Samuel Jackson as Mace Winddu is always great. And can Liam Neeson ever go wrong? You know he announced this week he is quitting acting? Probably a good place to do it at- a high point (and besides- his character, 'Qui-Gon Jinn' ain't coming back [Oops! Plot point unveiled!!]). The look of this film is lush compared to ANY of the first 3. Lucas and ILM gang have don't a GREAT job. I predict this could be the first Sci-Fi best pic at the Oscars. Music was up-to-par (been listening to it off and on for 3 weeks). William's best is still the Original theme (heard here at the opening as usual- sequing to new themes particualr to Episode 1) and CE3K, hands-down. I am glad George L. directed and said he'd do the next  2. He's not a great director but he's a good story-telling director and I feel like I am in an easy chair with a loved-one in my lap watching his films (or at the Samuel Goldwyn, the AMPAS theatre in B.H.- cooooozy!). I am also glad we are returned to Tatooine- not enough Jawas for my taste (or Tuskin raiders!), this time around. Remember the Teaser Poster for Star Trek 5 (the Shatner-directed one)- a theatre seat with a seat belt- well that film didn't live up to the suggestion, but perhaps the poster for this should have had restraints keeping one at the edge of their seat. This is a great time. 'Pay no attention to that reviewer behind the newspaper......go see it!'",Null,0,1,18 May 1999
Ali," Hard to believe this undisciplined film is from Michael Mann
","I saw 'Ali' the other night- Smith is very good- film is just OK. Directing is unremarkable-to-junior college film 101. Interesting that Mario van Pebbles pulls off playing Malcolm X- a good but too restrained job of it. Guy playing Howard Cossell is cartoonish- largely due to the appliances on his mug to try and get him looking like HC- however the friendship between Ali and HC comes through. Smith deserves the Oscar nom he got. The essence of the boxer comes through, but the entire story is still awaiting lensing. Film should have been helmed by someone else. Perhaps since Spike Lee did such a good job on his X biopic, he'd have been a better choice. You won't be wasting your time watching this though.",5,0,1,30 April 2005
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Star Wars Chapter VI: Review of the Jedi- 'A New Look'
","...watched my DVD of ROTJ yesterday. I honestly hadn't seen the film since the orig version- I had bought the VHS set (used) of the 'special edition' but had only seen the 1st film- I'd watched a few minutes of that version's Empire.... Other than the end of Jedi showing all the new 'celebration' footage establishing the cities to be seen in Chapter 1 and 2, and the additional Bespin stuff, and the re-ghosting of Anakin ala Hayden 'I seriously need some actin' lessons George!' Christiansen (in what might be said to be his BEST performance yet...) it was unchanged. And that means a big yawn. Jedi disappointed me on many levels- repeating the Deathstar, the scene where the Emperor is trying to do in Luke (with 'energy bolts'- when will something replace the lightening effect?!?!) and the shots of Darth looking back and forth obviously in a nature brain lock of 'What do I do??'- it could have been executed differently (I know- there's only SO MUCH expression one can give a big IL' dumb black helmet), the use of the goofy-ass giant fish guy as a commanding general, give me a break (GMAB!), the use of what-ever-the-crap-it-was-supposed-to-be as Lando's co-pilot aboard the Falcon. Geeze, George- Those last two were primo instances to exercise your obsession with CGI!!! And since Star Trek VI and a couple of films that overused it, that silly expanding energy ring got tired BEFORE you used it in the 'special edition'. At least continuity was maintained- BOTH 'splodin' Deathstars had it.... (although in Jedi you get to see the sucker expand past the viewer's POV- that was sort of cool). And he did add flames to a TIE fighter spinning out of control into a Star destroyer. Adding all the additional celebration stuff at the end doesn't help the film- the lethargic Pricess Leia performance goes unexplained ('Oh Paul honey! Put down that guitar and pass me that doobie, or toss me a 'shroom button!'), making Han look like he's regressed to some naive kid with very stupid lines, Luke returning to Dagobah to 'complete training' after he's already told Jabba and the 'world' that he's a Jedi (and effectively demonstrated it in spades) was a weird plot device for what? Showing the casperization of Yoda. Whoopee! Hey George! That dropping blanket after der Yoda vanishes was some hot trick, dude.... Oh and how 'bout when the rescuers are entering Jabba the Butt's palace- here we have all sorts of guises- bounty hunters of every shape and size (staying in the shadows I noticed......why? Doesn't scum and villainy have a right to party openly with the fat sluggoid? Or are they too aware of the trapdoor to Rancor land?), even Leia, disguised by a 1953 Chevy AM radio headpiece (makes me wonder what fantasy of youthdom Geo. Lucas was hung up on in that design...), IS disguised, and in comes Big IL' backstabbin' Lando in some gawd-awful seashell and bones facepiece that looks like something Gilligan made up for the 3rd Halloween party on his island.... Geeze, Dude! You own and run a magnificent skyborn floating city that has fabulous wealth written all over, and you dig up this piece of Jawa poodoo?? Now, seeing Leia in a too brief (and I sincerely believe it could have been BRIEFER) beach outfit was OK, but isn't even the thought of Yoda and humanoidal women together a bit '10 minutes past perverted'? And George did add more babage to the whole Jabba's lair sequence proving once again the old Popeye film making maxim: 'Out of story substance? Add womens....' The flying cycle chase(s) are fun, as is the use of the two-legged At-At's, but the whole syrupy teddy bear Ewok stuff? Again, <cough> GMAB. May the forest be with you.",Null,0,0,12 November 2004
American Psycho," As interesting as slapping chalk erasers together....
","'If you can't say something good about a movie...' or so the paraphrase goes. I suppose the most glaring thing I can cite about the film is- I DIDN'T PICK UP ANY TIPS!!! What's up with that? 'Modern American Male looking for Love, Lust and just OODLES of blood, desires that special someone who can die C-R-E-A-T-I-V-E-L-Y. Should carry own HMO plan.' Now- how many times have you seen THAT personal ad? Patrick Bateman (acted by Christian Bale- the child star of possibly the best Spielberg film, 1987's 'Empire of the Sun') as portrayed here is less than two-dimensional. And maybe that's the rub and I just don't get it??? Yowza! There is lots o' talent in this here flic. Bale tosses his native UK-eseic accent wonderfully- but the fascination just DOESN'T CARRY THE FILM!!! No- I didn't read the novel (simple fact: not interested), but due to a true devotee of that raucous best-seller having dropped lots of 'visuals' about it over a span of time I think I had a feel for it. The director is relatively new, and though she makes a professional-looking production, she don't have the suspense thing down. She could take some lessons from mother Hitchcock, such as 'WATCH MY PSYCHO!' The film tells you the guy is sick. It shows you why. It ends inconclusively- even hinting that maybe the carnage didn't occur at all. Huh-wha....? Roll credits. Certainly as inventive as the conclusion of 'Fight Club', I'd say. I was expecting Jackson Pollack and all we get is a spilled cans of Campbell's Tomato Soup. Wassup wid dat? And the really clever part- Bateman constantly reviewing audibly, in front of the potential [more like 'upcoming'] victims, the on-going careers and discographies of such fledgling '80's rock artists like Huey Lewis and Whitney H., that just got me sooooo involved with the almost chronically-deep characterizations. Maybe we or I have become so inured by carnage in the past 20 years or so of American film that I am now starving for a bit of STORY to go with it! Want to get involved in good suspense, wit, and plot? Read the new Spenser novel.",Null,0,0,20 April 2000
American Beauty," Holds your interest, but not your empathy
","Spacey gives his best performance yet; Bening does well (for once not being grating). Supporting cast is good. This film makes no claim to attempts at realism and is more akin to a weird, unimportant dream. A film that keeps you interested but has nothing that compels to watch again. This entire film feels as though one is being transported through an insomniatic skism- the super-dysfunctional mother (Bening) that most of saw growing up at a friend's house (but never our own). A Dad, basically an O.K. but uninterested (but interesting) guy in a doldrum-rut finding a spark to reignite his libido/life (daughter's g/f- played by Mena Suvari) and augmented by new neighbor kid/pot dealer played very intriquingly by Wes Bentley. The daughter seems to be, along with new boyfriend (Wes) one of the few with 2 feet planted firmly in reality. Well-known TV-quality actor Scott Bakula finally portrays the role he seemed destined for- the stereotypical gay (as portrayed in the non-PC days when 'gay' roles entering mainstream film) other neighbor. Chris Cooper- the hugely underrated actor (he was the father in 'October Sky') is too disturbing as a retired hardcore Marine Colonel and Wes' father. This is a melodrama played up for the moment due to a lack of current input of fakish Lawrence Kasden fare, but without the fake 'tude attached- the psycho-tropic flippantism still intact. See this movie, be entertained for a while then go see other films.",Null,0,0,1 October 1999
