Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," TOTAL CRAP- WHAT A BETRAYAL TO STAR WARS FANS
","Without a doubt, this is the worst Star Wars movie in the series and quite possibly one of the worst in its genre.  Take away the Lucas brandname, the star-studded cast and the overworked special effects, and you have an extremely poorly written, totally incoherent farce that carries an underlying theme of racism throughout.  The beauty and mystique of Star Wars has been wrecked by introducing half-baked concepts into the storyline, such as 'mediclorans' being the origin of the Force.  PLEASE!!! This is EXACTLY what the Highlander sequels did to the original movie.  As I watched the conclusion to the battle between Obi-Wan and Maul, I could not help but stare in utter disbelief.  The outcome is totally nonsensical and if you look closely you will notice a MAJOR editing error in the scene.  Shame on you, George Lucas!  Please quit while you are ahead and leave the series UNFINISHED!!!!",2,0,1,5 June 2000
Lost in Translation," The world must be full of despondent middle-aged husbands and hopeful, yet equally despondent young wives...
","for this movie to be so highly praised.  Nice shooting and structure, subtle dialogue and acting, but you know, in the end, so what?  Been there, done that.  I think it will be interesting to see a few centuries from now how history records the way people so eagerly lapped up recent movies representing their entrapment in what has probably become an archaic and unnatural institution, marriage, i.e. American Beauty, i.e. In The Bedroom etc etc etc etc.  Everybody gets married and then everybody ends up wanting to have an affair, but they don't go through with it, so they end up getting excited over movies like this.  I'm not sure what it offers to them - Inspiration?  Consolation?  Whatever. 77/100",7,0,1,28 February 2004
The Bourne Identity," A Travesty. Ludlum is turning in his grave.
","This movie had absolutely nothing to do with the original story so masterfully told in Ludlum's book and subsequent trilogy.  If the producers are going to make such a huge departure from plot and details they should just give the flick another name instead of trying to scam fans of the series.  Even without this glaring shortcoming, the movie itself as a spy film was just average, the rhythm and pacing erratic and the plot hardly compelling.",3,1,2,25 January 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Throwing pearls to swine
","To all you mediocrities out there whining about how the Wachowskis have sold out and are milking a franchise for all it's worth - I would like to point out that:1. Taking over 60 days to film a 14 minute highway sequence and spending millions of dollars on a single scene is NOT selling out. 2. Having your actors train full-time, 5 days a week for several months to meticulously choreographed fight scenes is NOT selling out.Selling out and milking a franchise would be making Friday the 13th Part VIII.If the Wachowskis wanted to simply cash in on your desperate, barren imaginations, they could've done it in 2 days and produced something like Wing Commander.If you're having trouble with all the loose ends and unanswered questions, then may I suggest something a little less straining on your limited intellect, like The Fast and The Furious.  I'm sure that movie has much less ambiguity for your jaded tastes, and will spoon-feed you the answers like you need them.I am by no means a huge fan of the Matrix trilogy, nor did I find the last 2 installments particularly good, but Reloaded and Revolutions were, in their own right, entertaining and visually spectacular.  Get off your expectations and what you think Hollywood/the Wachowskis 'OWE' you.  If you're too cheap to spend 10 bucks or whatever it costs you to take a chance on someone else's efforts and achievements, then just stay home and watch TV all day. Like any notable work of its time, The Matrix series will be looked upon by history as something wasted on the cynical, uncomprehending and unappreciative rabble it was released to.",7,5,11,8 November 2003
