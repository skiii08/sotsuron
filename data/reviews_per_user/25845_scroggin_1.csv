","Trailer is better than the film unfortunately. Horribly predictable, below-average editing, average script, good acting, light entertainment. Plot twist at the end but my bum was nowhere near the front of my seat.To be fair though it is intellectually interesting rather than Hollywood's typical 'bang boom gargle explosion boobies!' sci-thrill-fi.I think I was just annoyed because the villain in the story is delivered to you (at least I got it) in the very first scene. Like seriously editors/director/producers - how hard is it to stick to the modern movie making principle of keep your friends close and enemies closer? By not having the main character focusing in on the villain it become bleedingly obvious who it is. I'm sure that if you watched it though and well, didn't pick up on who it is then the film would have a lot more going for it. 1.75/5 stars",3,1,2,11 June 2011
