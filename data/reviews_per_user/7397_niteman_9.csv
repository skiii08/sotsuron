Antz," Antz is a great kids movie for grown-ups.
","The refreshing thing about Dreamworks SKG is that they don't appear to care very much about how marketable their films are.  Heck, the guys are millionaires, right?  This summer, for example, they made an action movie with believable characters and not much action (Deep Impact, which compared to Armageddon was practically a Merchant Ivory film).  And now with Antz they turn the world of children's animation on its ear.  This is stuff that Disney would never dare: No songs (or catchy broadway soundtrack), no bright colors, no hip sidekicks, No over-the-top villain.  Antz is edgy, and much of the humor adult. The PG rating isn't fooling around, you'll find three damns, a 'hell,' and a 'bitching' in here, as well as lines like 'I'm sorry, but drinking from the anus of another creature isn't my cup of tea.'  And yet Antz succeeds as a children's movie in spite, or perhaps because of its willingness to jettison the pop-culture junk that permeated Disney's Hercules, as well as the preachiness that ruined Pocahontas.  The paint-by-numbers plotting of recent animated movies is all but gone, as well -- the villain's master plan isn't fully fleshed out until the end of the film, instead of telegraphed in the first five minutes.  Antz is something of an oddity as a children's movie because it feels so completely *new*, every idea fresh, every plot twist unexpected.  When was the last time you watched a kid's movie and weren't sure how it was going to end?  Of course, it doesn't hurt that Antz looks GREAT.  The characters look real, not merely computer generated, and the Ant's eye view of the world is entrancing and nearly flawless (occasionally, the backgrounds look too static, but that's a minor quibble).   All in all, Antz is a fine movie.  Very young children should not be taken to see it, however; they will miss the humor, might be bored by some of the chattier scenes, and will most certainly be frightened by a termite/ant battle scene early on (heck, it frightened ME.  Those termites were nasty).  But anyone over the age of ten will be entranced by Antz' vision.  This is a film to see more than once, simply to appreciate the wit lurking behind the scenes (For example, in the ant/termite battle, every soldier on either side is killed except one ant.  The ants have a victory parade, and one sign reads 'One - nothing.  We win.'  If that's not skewering satire, tell me what is).  Pixar's 'A Bug's Life' will most certainly be more lively and bright than Antz, and more kid-friendly.  But it will also be safer, more predictable, and more clearly aimed at the bottom line (that is, selling toys and soundtracks).  Antz is a breath of fresh air in the genre, and will be fun for children and adults alike.",10,0,0,7 October 1998
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Are movie critics working for the dark side?
","I kept hearing that The Phantom Menace was something of a disappointment -- the characters were thin, the plot was sketchy, the special effects not so special.  Fortunately, I discovered that the critics were, as usual being over-critical.The Phantom Menace is phenomenal.  Sure, the weaknesses that plagued the first three films are here as well -- corny dialog, cheesy aliens, one-too-many coincidences -- but the strengths are stronger than they've ever been.  The light-saber duels crackle and zing, moving almost faster than the eye can follow, a heady blend of fencing and martial arts.   A series of historical meetings 'R2-D2, this is C3PO) gives you goosebumps. The planets are lush and beautiful, and colorful characters fill every frame.But above all, Lucas' storytelling makes The Phantom Menace.  You'll find yourself thrown into a complex plot that involves the Trade Federation, a crumbling Republic, and a grab for power by a Senator who we know will become an Emperor.  We sense forces stirring underneath the surface of the film, knowing that what we're seeing is the tip of a very large iceberg. And in the midst of these massive forces are a young queen, a little boy separated from his mother, and a brash teenage Jedi who is in way over his head.  Critics say the human element has been largely ignored, but I'm not sure what movie they were watching.In short, it ain't perfect, but it will blow you away.  At the very least, for two and a half hours, you'll feel like a ten year old again.  And that's worth the price of admission.",9,0,0,20 May 1999
Blade," Stop thinking and eat your popcorn!
","The first, oh, 70 minutes of Blade are what an action movie (and a comic book movie) should be.  The action sequences are well-choreographed, without the now-popular editing that makes it impossible to tell what's going on.  The special effects don't diminish from the fighting.  And little touches like blood raining from a sprinkler system let you know you 're in a very strange world. The last ten minutes of Blade are perhaps the strangest reversal in the history of film.  I don't want to give it away, but the villain goes through what will happen in great detail, and then it happens in a fashion completely different, which is unexplained.  It's like they decided to change the movie without telling us why.  Still, the final scenes do offer the most enervating sword-fight I've ever seen.  All in all, this is a cool movie.  Not a smart movie, not a movie that, ultimately, makes much sense, but a cool movie.  With some damn good techno, if I might add.  Go see it, but put your brain in neutral.",8,0,1,10 September 1998
The Mummy," Indiana Jones Lite
","The Mummy is, at heart, an adventure serial from the 1930's, which means it is in the same genre as the Indiana Jones films.  While it never achieves the excitement and awe that those movies brought to the big screen, it has its moments.The cast, for the most part, is outstanding.  Brendan Fraser plays another variation on his hunky-cartoony persona, swaggering and swashbuckling like an old pro.  Rachel Weisz is great as the feisty love interest, sort of a Lara Croft for the 1930's.  The chemistry between the two is real, and their dialog is witty and exciting.Arnold Vosloo makes a somewhat disappointing mummy, however.  He never seems very menacing -- largely because he looks more like a high school math professor than a mighty lord of the undead, with his doe eyes and pudgy face.Whether or not you like the special effects in the film will depend largely on how you feel about computer animation.  There are some shots, particularly of the mummy, that look like low-grade 'Hercules&Xena' quality effects, a surprise since the effects were done by Industrial Light&Magic. Some of it works, some doesn't, and it all would have looked better with models and makeup (but I'm old fashioned).Regardless, the movie is cheery, exciting, and fun.  There is an element of 'Army of Darkness' style camp which is good for laughs, but it also delivers some  good old-fashioned thrills and chills.No one will ever mistake The Mummy for a masterpiece -- it's too  slick, too post-modern, and at times embarrassingly silly (like the beginning, where characters stand around spouting plot exposition as if they're pitching us the movie).  But it's well worth the 6 or 7 dollars to see on the big screen.",8,0,0,12 May 1999
Notting Hill," Startingly original, nicely familiar Romantic Comedy.
","Unlike soft-focus confections like 'You've Got Mail' (which was more about the love between a consumer and large corporations than Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan), Notting Hill has a bit of an edge to it which serves the movie well. Grant and Roberts get to zing each other with all sorts of wonderfully hilarious dialog before the inevitable happens, and the cast of supporting characters (including a wheelchair-bound first love and a sad-sack stockbroker) keep the movie grounded and the sap quotient to a minimum. Perhaps the most astonishing thing, however, is the camerawork.  The director takes some chances -- jump cuts, one exceptional scene in which four seasons swirl around Grant's character as he walks down a London street -- that pay off big time.  This is a movie that was basically presold. Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts are huge box-office draws, and the words 'romantic comedy' and Julia Roberts together are pure gold.  It is refreshing, therefore, to find a well-written script, great performances from all involved, and some creative risk-taking.All in all, an excellent romantic comedy, a great date movie, and if you're single like me, another great excuse to stare at the bottle of sleeping pills and wonder how many it would take.",9,0,0,7 June 1999
Pitch Black," Oops -- WOW! -- Oops.
","Pitch Black opens with a long, slo-mo shot of a spaceship gliding by the camera.  Oops #1: obvious Star Wars rip-off.  It then presents us with a most improbable crash scene, in which the force of the landing blows out the ship's windshield but leaves the pilot remarkably unscathed.  Oops #2.  The crash scene is edited with MTV-on-Speed cuts, which are both impossible to follow and headache-inducing.  Oops #3.  By the time the spaceship actually touched down, I was regretting losing $4 on this movie.Fortunately, things pick up speed in the middle.  The visuals are gorgeous -- our heroes are on a planet with three suns, and the scenes are filmed in gorgeous washed-out blue and gold tones.  The deceptively calm surface of the planet serves as a backdrop for introducing and fleshing out characters, who are all given more depth than your average cheap sci-fi cast.  The tension climaxes with a gorgeous triple eclipse and the awakening of the underground dwellers of the planet, who look like a cross between Ridley Scott's Alien and a hammerhead shark.  As the characters scurried around huddling behind their meager and failing light sources, bickering with each other, the suspense was thick enough that it was hard to breathe.Unfortunately, the last half hour abandons any notion of story arc or plot in favor of killing of characters at random and twisting the plot in improbable directions.  The most interesting character, Vin Diesel's hulking homicidal maniac, is reduced to arm-wrestling the aliens and spouting Batman and Robin quality dialog.  By the last twist and the by-the-numbers ending, I was disappointed in the movie again.Out of the movie's two hours, the middle hour is great and the surrounding hour is average to horrid.  50% is generally an F, but for the great visuals I'll give it a C.",7,0,0,27 February 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," An impressive film with a bad marketing campaign
","Eyes Wide Shut is ill-suited for the summer movie corridor.  It has no explosions, no running, shouting, or a single gunshot.  What it has are long scenes in which characters talk to one another.  Slowly and carefully.  The problem is that the film is marketed as having white-hot sex scenes and plenty of gratuitous nudity, while it has neither.  There is plenty of naked flesh, don't get me wrong, but in exactly the opposite way that the ads make it appear.  This is not a movie about being sexy and naked -- it's a movie about how flesh is just another part of being human, so what is all the fuss about?  The marketing campaign is misleading, and led to disappointment in the audience that I saw the movie with, who were just looking for some skin.The tension in the plot and the issues that the film discusses aren't telegraphed to the audience, they're hinted at in the dialog.  There is no neat resolution at the end, life simply goes on.   You may watch the whole film and think 'that wasn't about anything!' Then think about what you've seen and realize it has a great deal to say.The film is a meditation on sexuality and how it relates to marriage, death, and money.  It's a fascinating commentary on modern life, and a rare movie that dares to examine sex as impassionately as any other issue.The directing and cinematography alone would be worth the price of admission without the social commentary.  The sets are an integral part of the movie; they breathe and glow and live.  Kubrick was a master director, and he uses long shots and dissolves to great effect.  Cruise and Kidman are at their best, and the supporting cast is also strong.  It's Kubrick's magic work with the camera that holds the film together.All in all, definitely worth seeing for the un-uptight.  It's possible to watch this film and actually think about it for hours afterward.  That's something you won't get with the Wild, Wild West.",9,412,526,17 July 1999
The Sixth Sense," A haunting, beautiful movie.
","The first thing I noticed about the movie was that the music was creepier than even the X-Files theme, which is a definite accomplishment.  The second thing was that M. Night Shamlyan's has a great eye for setting up shots and knows exacly when to end a scene.  The third thing was that my heart was pounding and I could barely breathe.  There are some truly unsettling, suspenseful scenes here, all centering around an amazing performance by the movie's 11-year-old star.  The movie works on so many levels -- and the last five minutes make it effectively two movies, the one that you've been watching and the one that you *weren't* watching, that slipped by under radar.  Definitely one to see twice.Not just freaky, not just suspenseful, but beautifully crafted and graced with standout performances from Osment and Willis.  The summer's only other successful horror movie, The Blair Witch Project, worked because it took place in a recognizable reality.  In essence, 6th Sense makes its own reality and gently, subtly drags the viewer into it.  There are revelations that hit with near-physical force, and there are moments of sheer masterly filmmaking as well.  Definitely worth a full-price ticket.",9,0,0,19 August 1999
The Matrix," What's all the fuss about?
","Having finally seen the Matrix after hearing people sing its praises for months, I confess I'm a bit  baffled as to why it's so popular.  It was a good film, yes -- slick visuals, cool effects, nice fight sequences, interesting ideas -- but nowhere near a *great* film, and certainly undeserving of the brou-ha-ha it's been getting.Great science fiction films are original, they provide a new visual or mental language for the viewer or present old ideas in new ways.  Films such as Blade Runner, Alien, Star Wars: A New Hope, and 2001 are examples of that sort of filmmaking.  The Matrix is not.  The visuals are an uneasy mesh of Blade Runner and Alien, the idea that our world is an illusion was most recently explored in the far superior Dark City, and the mythology smacks of Star Wars.  Even though the movie does provide plenty of eye candy, it pays homage to the point of theft.The movie is also overlong, divests most of its plot twists in the first 30 minutes, relies too heavily on extended slo-mo fight scenes (How many spent rounds do we need to see floating slowly to the ground?), and frequently trips over its own internal logic.  But if there is a weak point around which all else seems insignificant, it's Keanu Reeves.  His pipe cleaner body and sunken chest don't fit his role as kung-fu master, and when he strikes a 'manly' pose he just looks silly.  His acting talent is on par with his other work, which means he says 'whoa' and looks blank a lot. It's a dangerous thing to base a movie around a non-entity like Reeves -- even when his character has his (cliched) is-he-dead-or-isn't-he scene, I couldn't bring myself to care.In short, it's a fun movie, a nice action film posing as a sci-fi film, but don't rent it if you're looking for something that will make you think, or something that you haven't seen before.",7,1,2,29 December 1999
