The Blair Witch Project," Not scary, but creepy
","After all of the hype (One newscaster said, 'the last 15 minutes is the most scary piece of film I've ever seen'), Blair Witch left me kinda flat.  Sure, it was VERY creative, it had a good story and was also kind of funny.  BUT, it was not scary.  It didn't have shock value, like any other horror movie. I was also slightly disappointed when we didn't even get to see at least a shadow of what was terrorizing the three documentarians the whole time. But, if you go in NOT expecting the scariest movie of all time, you might be a little creeped out.  But I was expecting the scariest movie of all time, and I came out wanting another teeny-bopper slash film.  Still a good movie to see.  It's entertaining to watch the spirits of our heroes decompose in front of our eyes!",Null,1,1,1 August 1999
