Requiem for a Dream," i love this movie
",this is one of the very few movies that have almost made me cry... and i never cry at movies.  when you get to the end it completely grabs you by the balls and takes over your emotions.  I'm disappointed that it only got nominated for one oscar.10/10.,10,0,1,22 November 2001
The Fast and the Furious," good action scenes, horrible acting and plot
","The action scenes in this movie are pretty good, its a great movie to watch on DVD if you have surround sound. I'd rate the action scenes as an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the highest).  The problem with this movie is the plot and the acting.  The acting is so horrible that it almost made me sick to my stomach. Same for the plot, it's extremely stupid and ridiculous. Also, who the hell hijacks a truck by jumping on it while moving at 65mph? What ever happened to blocking the road and pointing guns at it?  This is a teenagers movie.  All what you'll see is driving, partying, and a pathetic attempt in trying to give the movie a plot.  This movie would have been much better if there was no acting or plot and just a bunch of racing and car crashes etc. 4/10.",4,0,1,4 January 2002
