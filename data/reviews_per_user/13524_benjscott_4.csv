Skyfall," 'With pleasure, M... with pleasure.'
","After the poor success of Quantum of Solace (2008). Bond was shelved due to financial issues. In 2010, I said to myself. 'For the 50th anniversary and coinciding London 2012 Olympics. The world will be looking at Britain like a massive firework!'So, in 2011... Skyfall as the title, I was pleased when my sister announced it to me. I knew Skyfall would be the appropriate year for 2012. The golden milestone anniversary of the film series needed a new one. I knew for a second that Adele would be the epic singer for the opening credits sequence. My wish came true, the producers went for her.With high hopes, went to the cinema. I praised it big time! I was pleased and satisfied, preordered the Steelbook Edition.Weeks later, it grossed over $1 billion making it the highest grossing James Bond film in history. I was pleased for Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. They knew they were on the ropes and I believed Albert R. 'Cubby' Broccoli are proud of them in spirit.",8,1,4,6 May 2019
Quantum of Solace," 'You people should find yourselves a better place to meet.'
","This was the first Daniel Craig Bond film I saw at a cheap cinema. It was worth it because I thought this film would live up to expectations from its direct sequel, Casino Royale (2006). The title, Quantum of Solace of course was taken from Ian Fleming's novel, For Your Eyes Only where they also found From a View to a Kill which they dropped 'From' off the title.This film had a massive budget wasted on for being the shortest runtime of all Bond films to date. I couldn't understand where Bond was going in this film, I mean they copied Goldfinger with a death of a Bond girl. It felt bland as a filler for Casino Royale (2006).After it's poor success and financial difficulties, Bond 23 was shelved for the time being until 4 years later.",7,1,2,6 May 2019
Casino Royale," 'Yes... considerably.'
","Here we are, the new era of James Bond. Post 9/11 era, the digital age, the new millennium. The world needs Bond as there international terrorists out there disguised as citizens.When Daniel Craig was casted as James Bond in 2005 after producer Barbara Broccoli was satisfied watching him in Layer Cake (2004). The public was shocked about him being blonde. The fans boycotted him so badly.In the end Daniel Craig had no choice but to get on with his 5 picture deal contract.With Dame Judi Dench as the only actress from the 1962-2002 era films return as M was a great bridge to peak into the new era Bond. I'd say Craig and Dench we bloody astonishing in this film along with GoldenEye (1995) director, Martin Campbell. Casino Royale (2006) approved the critics. The fans found it delightful as for former James Bond actor (1973-85) Sir Roger Moore found it that brilliant, he went and actually purchased the DVD of the film and declared him as his favourite Bond eclipsing Sean Connery. Even though in an interview, Connery said that Daniel Craig was excellent!",8,1,4,6 May 2019
Spectre," 'Doesn't time fly when you're having fun?'
","After Skyfall's major success. The only way to make SPECTRE bigger. Is to have a bigger budget. It did, James Bond is back in his original ways with a male M, Q and Moneypenny that didn't appear properly in Craig's era until this film. This Bond film was a being like the Connery era but. This film didn't have the right elements to deliver them. Just chase - shoot - crash - explosion and repeating it.Well, after 5 years off screen which Bond never had since the early 1990's. James Bond returns in a new decade of the 2020's with Daniel Craig as Bond for the last time.I'm with everyone involved with Bond 25 all the best.",8,0,0,6 May 2019
