The Blair Witch Project," I applaud the innovative approach, but not the result
","I always like to see people trying new things, so in that respect I applaud the Blair Witch Project.  However the end result was basically terrible.  There was not one moment in this film that I, or any of the 5 others I went with that I could tell, was scared by this film in any way shape or form.  The characters portrayed are complete idiots whose approach to problems is to cry a lot. Gee, thats drama for you, not! -jrg",1,2,5,18 October 1999
Cast Away," good film, should have been set in the 60s
","My only real complaint about Cast Away is that it is virtually impossible to get lost on a tropical island, WITH a life raft (since rafts nearly universally I think, in this modern day have emergency transmitters (EPRBs or something like that)  that can be picked up by satellite and your location gets sent to the coast guard).  The jets radio black out is also rather implausible. The lack of infection from a major injury in topical (bacteria infested) waters is also at least extremely lucky. One of the things I liked abou it is that its sort of just a story of a guy going through an amazing experience, just s slice of life, not major upheaval and resolution and etc etc, an amazing slice of  life due to the circumstances, but just a guy somehow managing to get thorugh it.  Could have been you or me.  That, in addtion to the excellent direction, on location etc. gives it a very realistic feel.  I think Philadelphia is still Hank's best work, but Cast Away is good.",7,0,0,4 January 2001
Pearl Harbor," The graphics are great, but the script is weak.
","Having the romance angle is fine, such times do indeed take a toll on relationships.  But one of the most pivital times of the modern era seems to take a backseat to this exagerated and predictable love triangle.   When you had tears in your eyes, and I did, you also feel like you are being manipulated rather than feeling empathy for someone you have come to care about, to think of as real.  The agony of war is not due to the extreme soap operas of the beautiful people that it creates, but the swath it cuts through every day ordinary folks, who feel the loss of their loved ones just as much. I would have liked to see much more focus on the shuffleing of power in the governments of both sides and the intel-crypto rooms of both sides etc. Regarding the Computer Graphics, its good.  It still has a generated feel in some of the panaromic battle scenes, but the smaller shots where they are mixing real life and CG etc are really well done.  (the flight path of the zeros coming in on the deck over the valleys seems a bit eratic, but...).",5,0,0,29 May 2001
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Its good, but also disappointing
","As a docu-drama (i.e. trying to be like you were in the news studio of CBS at the time) its well done. But I wanted more than that. Its interesting that Murrow's on screen presence as the ultra serious reporter is depicted as just the way he is all the time (which may have been true, but seems a little doubtful). I found this to sort of dilute the weight of his words (that I have heard before). You also get nothing about who Murrow and Friendly were, why did they do this, what were the risks etc. What did they think and feel about it, what did their families think and feel about it, what price was paid etc. Clearly Friendly and Murrow (and others) put a lot of their lives into this, and must have been passionate about it, but that passion does not come across. Its like the cast is on anti-depressants and having their emotions compressed, no real highs, no real lows. It has this constant air of ultra seriousness, yet also a sort of superficialness. Its about what they did, but not who they were or why they did it. You get a little of this in the one scene with in Bill Pailey's office, but its not enough.",6,2,4,1 November 2005
Braveheart," Most romantic movie ever or just most gory?
","One of the most interesting things about this film is how differently people react to it.  When I offered it as one of the most romantic films I had ever seen, several people scoffed, commenting on how much death and gore there was and how could that possibly be viewed as being romantic.  True, the battles are horrific, hundreds, thousands, of men butchering each other in close quarter hand to hand combat.  There is decapitation, dismemberment, and rivers of blood and death.  Yet it is also the story of the power of commitment.  In the story (how true this is I can not say, but the theme works anyway) William Wallace gave up his life, gave himself entirely to free his country.  Nothing else mattered.  There is no cautions planning, no careful conservation of resource.Every fiber of Wallace's being is spent in every second on defeating his enemy, now, not tomorrow, but now, right now.  He lives entirely in the moment, being his commitment to free his country.   His success is a direct consequence of that total commitment.  And the source of that commitment was the love he had for his wife, his childhood sweetheart.  What could be more romantic than a love that changes the world?    If the tears aren't flowing in the final scene, about both an agonizing death, and the power of love to overcome even that horror, then your heart is made of stone.  This film is among the best I have ever seen.Great sound track too (interestingly enough I believe the new release Cast Away uses at least one of the same tracks).",10,2,3,28 December 2000
