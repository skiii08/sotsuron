Blade Runner 2049," Amazing (almost)
","This film gorgeous as everyone has noted. One of the most beautiful films I've seen in a while. It's not a breakthrough piece like the original but it's a good smart story all the same.I like sci fi and was enthralled for about three quarters of the film. There is a clever play on the question of how we would treat androids that reverses roles in the romantic life of the main protagonist 'K'. So much of the film revolves around the replicants that I felt something akin to culture shock. There's a grimly humorous reference to the anarchic bands of post apocalyptic humans found in so many other future dystopias. The return of Deckard is mostly well done. The interesting question of whether he is a replicant is almost answered but (again) thankfully not conclusively. The film is too long. I thought that was just the complaint of a younger generation brought up on thoughtless Marvel 'sci fi'. But some scenes added time without purpose. And for all that time taken the film ends without much of a conclusion. Maybe that's okay: not an archetypal storyline. But you can feel the producers wanting a sequel if the film does well. I'm not a fan of this contemporary trend that puts box office takings ahead of story structure. Despite its length I felt the film was well paced overall. Perhaps the biggest fumble is the character of Wallace. Unlike the original film this one contains an unambiguous 'bad guy'. He's a straightforward psychopath from central casting. And boring as a result. What's worse, they gave him some quirky robot doodads - a clear cover for the lack of depth in the character. His henchwoman replicant is better, she's got some personality and a more relatable motive. I'm particularly fond of dystopian film futures. And this is a very good one with a few notable flaws.",7,4,8,17 October 2017
