Ford v Ferrari," I'm not the fan of motorsports. Yet I was for over two hours
","Years ago, I would say that I'm not interested in seeing a story about motorsports. But it all changed with 'Rush' - it was a great movie that made me realize this topic isn't that boring as I thought.
But Le Mans'66 brought it just to another level. The ultimate level, actually.
It's a masterpiece, that will entertain you more than anything you've seen in this year (maybe except Joker, which is great too).Great characters, fantastic acting, great scenario, wonderful camera work and beautiful cars!Definitely a 'must see' - in IMAX, if possible",10,3,5,10 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," So deeply disappointed, that I'm giving up this franchise
","When I watched it, I could not believe my eyes...Everything there was wrong! Wrong, unnecessary characters that do absolutely unnecessary things, the number of fundamental Star Wars universe rules broken increases rapidly every minute, the number of facepalms per minute - ridiculous.It is so irritating how easily the screenwriters simply flush down the toilet all the ideas that JJ Abrams was trying to introduce and - probably - develop through the upcoming movies, that I hope that some day someone more sensible will tell 'OK, that movie was a joke, let's forget it and reboot the Star Wars beginning from Episode 8.Why 2 stars instead of 1? Actually, it should get 0 stars, but I'm giving it '2' for a single reason:This movie made Episode VII look good.Argh!",2,13,19,5 June 2019
