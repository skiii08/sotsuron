10 Cloverfield Lane," Thrilling, unsettling, exciting - with a twist at the end!
","Seeing really good movies is rare these days. Lots of remakes, some of them wholly unjustified, and lots of really bad movies, too. So when something that exceeds the original comes along as a sort-of sequel, it's a pleasure.10 Cloverfield Lane was a total surprise. I liked the original Cloverfield a lot, even if the actual pictures of aliens attacking were very distant and disappointing, yet the action was great and so was the edginess, the hand-held camera, the priceless shot of Lady Liberty's head rolling down the avenue in New York.How to follow that and make it even better? 10 Cloverfield Lane. The basic premise is simple - a woman is run off the road by a large pick up after a scary encounter at an eerily dark gas station in the middle of nowhere. We don't know much about her except that she has just run away from her husband/boyfriend/partner and is just driving to escape. And yet, she picks up the mobile when he calls, which is ultimately her undoing. Sideswiped into a deep ravine. Next, she awakens chained to a wall, attached to a medical drip, in a bleak cellar, not understanding where she is, blood-matted hair and on a mattress on the ground.Enter John Goodman in one of his best roles ever - he's the scary 'dungeon master,' who insists he rescued her after the car wreck and brought her to his lair to nurse her back to health... although he doesn't tell her of his ulterior and ultimate motives, which are not hard to guess...But the pot thickens with the introduction of another inhabitant of Goodman's lair... one who tells our main protagonist that the world outside is contaminated, possibly destroyed. Goodman compounds the tale, and when a CB radio is seen in what turns out to be an incredibly well-stocked underground nuclear fallout shelter they are all sharing, she never tries to contact the outside world on it after being told by Goodman that he's tried and it is all to no avail.The plot develops with some immensely interesting personality traits that are just plain weird and eerie. As soon as you settle into believing that Goodman's character is a complete pervert, a murderer and more, along comes her escape and the connection to the original Cloverfield, but this time we get to see the aliens up close. And ugly they are, too.Enough said, go see it. You won't be sorry. And the door's been left open for a sequel, which I do hope gets made and I look forward to.",10,5,9,3 April 2016
Interstellar," Interesting but very long-winded...
","INTERSTELLAR was an interesting film to watch. Excruciatingly long at nearly 3 hours, I felt it could have been cut in several places without harming the plot and making it eminently more watchable. I know some here will disagree with me, but that's how I felt after what seemed a very long time spent of sequences involving wormholes, black holes, etc. that could have been condensed.Performances by everyone in the cast were extraordinary and in some cases Oscar-worthy. The future of our planet, as painted hauntingly by the film, was fascinating to me and one of the better aspects. I also loved the scene in the school where the parents are told that the books they have raised their children with are 'Federal' and therefore undesirable as they purport the moon landings in 1968 to be real instead of a huge, government-perpetrated fake, as the future apparently will reveal according to the beautifully satirical scenes in the film.Some of the special effects were wonderful, and generally the film was enjoyable, but I overheard many leaving the theatre wondering aloud if they had actually enjoyed the film or not, and, due to the incredible and unnecessary length, I had to wonder the same thing myself.",7,1,5,8 November 2014
Jurassic World," More ham than a Christmas dinner
","Keeping in mind the first the Jurassic series entries, I read the reviews on IMDb before going to see this turkey and was amazed that so many people thought it was so brilliant. Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard and Vincent D'Onofrio called in their performances, resulting in some of the most shallow, I- couldn't-give-a-damn characters on screen. Whether that's what Colin Trevorrow was aiming for I don't know, but considering the hokey performances from Ty Simpkins, Nick Robinson, Judy Greer and BD Wong, one has to assume he was aiming for the lowest common denominator and the shallow end of the pool.A wholly uninspired cast sleepwalks its way through a monotonous, boring plot underscored by bombastic music more worthy of a made- for-cable production than a supposed blockbuster. The only bright note throughout the entire ordeal is a praiseworthy performance delivered by Irrfan Khan as the big boss of Jurassic World, the be all, end all of unrealistic theme parks - think Disney World on steroids with live dinosaurs instead of animatronic ones.The opening is a family scene with a desperately clutchy mother, Judy Greer, saying goodbye to her little darlings going on an unaccompanied trip to La Isla I Don't Care to go see the dinosaurs, where the big bad theme park is conveniently run by her flibbertigibbet sister, played by Bryce Dallas Howard. All the emotions throughout the film seem hackneyed and either totally over the top or so shallow that your feet wouldn't even get properly wet.Once we see Jurassic World, we are introduced in quick succession to Chris Pratt playing a character he apparently based on a combination of Crocodile Dundee, Indiana Jones and any number of other hokey jungle-style macho misogynists.The naughty brothers played by Simpkins and Robinson ditch their (naturally) British nanny, and thanks to aunty's VIP passes for them are the last on a ridiculous theme park ride just as the big bad lab-concocted supersaurus escapes and begins to eat and terrorize everyone in sight.The resulting hunt and chase scenes, complete with cheesy oeuvres by D'Onofrio playing an InGen madman wanting to use the dinosaurs as soldiers of the future for the U.S. army, are at times hilarious enough to wonder if the entire cast had a parody in mind, and at other times so stunningly poorly acted that I assume multiple retakes were necessary and everyone's collective spirit flagged to the point of 'let's just get it over with.'Another point leading to the conclusion that this was intended as parody is the fact that the theme park - oh so closely based on Disney World and targeting the same lolling tourist audiences - was completely devoid of the average profile theme park visitor - the overweight American. All the visitors to Jurassic World are beautiful people who do not at all look like the regular theme park crowd and make it more like a EuroDisney with giant lizards.The dinosaurs themselves, the CG and blue screen techniques used are noteworthy and fun at times, sometimes predictably boring and inane.There were a number of (most likely unintentional) belly laughs throughout, just as the plot was so utterly predictable as to be totally uninspiring; the phrase 'mind-numbingly mundane' springs to mind...If you are looking for anything like Oscar-worthy performances or an unforgettable story-line, skip this film. If technology and blue screen stunts are your bag, then you'll like this film. Don't expect anything more than pretty low- grade B-Film acting, writing, direction and execution here.",3,48,99,12 June 2015
Woman in Gold," Oscar-worthy Mirren steals the show
","Woman in Gold, beautifully written and acted with gripping performances from Ryan Reynolds and Daniel Br√ºhl alongside memorable cameos from Elizabeth McGovern and Moritz Bleibtreu, deserves several Oscar- nominations. Helen Mirren delivers a tour-de-force performance and the entire film mirrors high production standards, excellent continuity and obviously skillful direction from Simon Curtis along with a wonderful musical score.Those pundits here and on other sites panning this little gem because they are either anti-Semitic or think that money and lawyers getting rich was the only motive for this real-life story have missed the point entirely and should probably stick to watching mindless shlock like Jurassic World instead of something tender and lovingly crafted dealing with a difficult but nevertheless touching story told with a warmth, obvious love and pride of craftsmanship that is not often found in many films these days.",8,3,4,12 June 2015
