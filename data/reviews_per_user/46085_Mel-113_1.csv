Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," For those who dream and love life.
","We all know about the saga, characters, etc. So I'll briefly discuss what Lucas, I think, wanted to accomplish.SW: E1 movie is for people who love going to movies and seeing a vast richness of life and art unfold before them. Lucus' vision (to name a few), depicts the battle between good and evil, art nouveau of the 1920s, exotic locations, heroism, kings and queens, sci fi civilizations reminiscent of Alex Raymond's Flash Gordon, space ships, space flights, and not to mention the state-of-the-science cgi.It's not just about good sfx - such as the Matrix. It's about an epic, a saga, and great imaginative film making that captures the essence of mankind.The movie is indeed created by marketing gurus, however, it goes beyond the aspect of money making. It's about work that's filled with true passion: a Leonardo Da Vinci note book, a Hemingway novel, Jordan's drive to win NBA championships, a computer hacker's program, a professor's lecture, an artist's sketch, and a writer's vision.Great movie - 8/10. It's for those who dream and love life.",8,0,0,24 May 1999
