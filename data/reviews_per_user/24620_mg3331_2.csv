It," It shines
","There are two basic reasons I went to see this movie. First is because it is a Steven King adaption and in this case I would say a very good one. The other reason is because Finn Wolfward (can't wait to see him in Stranger Things 2) is among the cast of young leads and I would say he stands out the most. It's good that they stayed quite loyal to the book and produced an R rated film rather then a toned down version which would ruin the whole thing in my opinion. Strong scary scenes, good chemistry between the kids and generally a satisfactory effort. Maybe one of the movies of the year and maybe worth viewing a second time.",9,4,11,12 September 2017
Jurassic World," Jurassic World surprise hit!
","The success of this movie is a little surprising considering it is just retreading old ground from the earlier films but now that I've seen it (must be viewed in 3D to fully appreciate it) I would have to say that it does deserve to be big box office. The dinosaur effects have improved slightly since the original movie. I found the first half a little slow but once the action started it had my attention. Of course like the other Jurassic films it had to have a couple of kids in danger (not really of course)and these two did pretty well on their own without adult help. At the climax we have an epic battle between the dinosaur creatures while the main characters get a ringside seat. As for the idea of having a Jurassic theme park well, if such a place was really possible and in the light of all the disasters in the previous films you would have to wonder how many customers they would really attract. I would say however it is a quite impressive piece of entertainment.",8,48,94,15 June 2015
