Angels & Demons," For someone who hasn't read the book
","I liked it, I mean, it's not an awesome movie, but it's worth the ticket. It keeps you entertained, you really wanna know if they are gonna save the next Preferiti, or what the clues mean. In my country, several people did not want to see the movie due to its topic and how it affects the image of the Catholic Church, but come on, I'm Catholic and I'm not offended, despite that some of the stuff referred in the movie are true (the problems with Galileo Galilei, for example)we're still good people, so don't make a big deal out of it... Overall, the movie entertains you, I didn't expect that Ewan McGregor's character would be the villain, it does keep you at the expectation of what's next, you want to know how it ends. I want to see the Lost Symbol Worth the two hours and the movie ticket",8,0,1,1 August 2010
Forrest Gump," My reaction...
","About Forrest Gump... I'll only say that I cried like a baby when the movie ended and I'm not the type of person who cries whenever she sees a chick flick or a drama. Seriously, there are only like three movies that have made me cry and I mean real crying. This film has a soul and you can easily fall in love with the characters. With this movie I suffered, laughed and felt real tenderness towards Forrest. Sometimes I feel that Academy Awards winners are overrated but this movie deserved every award.Kudos, Tom Hanks It's a must see if you consider yourself a movie fan.",10,3,5,31 July 2010
Saving Private Ryan," One of my favorites
","OK, I'm a girl who is not a big fan of movies with gunshots and war, but I loved this movie. The first 20 minutes alone earned Spielberg the Oscar for best director, they are realistic, you can see and really infiltrate the horror of D Day, you can feel the despair, anger, madness and courage of the American soldiers. But what I loved the most was the fight of the principal characters for staying human and earn the right to go home after killing a lot of people, bad guys, but still people. It keeps you at the edge of your sit, wondering if they are gonna be able to find Ryan, and when they do, if they are gonna win the battle at Ramelle. The only negative thing I gotta say about this movie, is that I expected that a principal character would die and surprise! Tom Hanks dies.Going back to the beginning, the first 20 minutes left my jaw on the floor. I'm not American, but my country helped the American soldiers with supplies and nursing, and it makes you proud of pulling something right 'out of this s**tty mess'Congrats Spielberg!",10,1,2,1 August 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Excellent!
","I have to say that I'm a LOTR fan, and this movie is my favorite film out of the three. Even though some Frodo-Sam-Gollum, Merry-Pippin scenes were a little bit boring, the final hour compensates it all. I think it's one of the greatest battle sequences we have seen in the last 10 years, it keeps you at the edge of the seat; the directing, the location, the acting, the music, even the rain, it all comes perfectly together to make us feel the chaos, the high, the rush that the characters experience. I've read the books (after watching the films), and I have to recognize that there are a lot of episodes missing, but it is for the best; Tolkien created a whole new world: culture, languages, thousands of years in history... it is impossible to put it all in a movie, but the very essence of the books can be seen on the big screen. So, kudos for the writers.Going back to where I started, maybe the first two hours are a little slow, but those 60 minutes at the end make the ticket worth it, it is EPIC; and it is deep story too, because it's not all about whether they are gonna lose or win the war, it's about friendship, loyalty, inner strength, going against the odds, this is a good movie because the characters have a soul, they are not hollow (like Avatar).Love this movie",9,0,2,3 August 2010
Schindler's List," A work of Art
","Thank God for Steven Spielberg! Oh my God! this is one of the deepest movies you can see, I know that Spielberg is Jewish, so you can tell that every detail of the film is personal for him. I can't watch this movie again, I suffered though the entire film, and cried my guts out from minute 10. The casting... It was the right choice not to cast famous actors, it would have taken the seriousness from the film, Liam Neeson gives a strong performance through the film, I mean, he helps the Jewish, but he still sees them as an inferior race, but at the end, when he breaks down in tears after they give him the ring, he recognizes them as people, not workers, people. One of the best scenes ever, I loved the transition of the character. Ralph Fiennes is an excellent villain, I love the inner fight that he has when he 'falls in love' with Helen, his performance gives you goose bumps. The symbolism, how it is all in black and white, except for the girl in the red coat, the innocence of a kid walking around corpses, the death of innocence, for me. Gives me chillsI mean, you hear about the Holocaust in History class, but you can't imagine how cruel that was, at least I had no idea, and when the movie ended, I spent some minutes crying, wondering how was that possible, to treat people worse than animals. One thing is clear Holocaust must NEVER happen again.An the music is breathtaking is sadness translated into a score...This a breathtaking movie. It is art.It really touches your heart, you suffer and cry with the Jewish people.PURE ART",10,9,13,3 August 2010
The Hurt Locker," Best Picture of the year? Seriously???
","This movie is so boring, it had me watching the clock every ten minutes. I'm sorry, but not everyone is Spielberg, and Bigelow is not ready to do a war movie, she just can't pull that off. It takes more than just the 'shaky camera' to make a good war film. I mean, I get it,I get that 'war is a drug' and makes you less human, but even that type of characters have a soul, they interest you and you wanna know how they end. But even the principal character is completely hollow. If there was a 'Hurt Locker 2' following the life of Jeremy Renner's character I wouldn't watch it. So for those who haven't seen this movie, don't do it, it would be a waste of money at Blockbuster. If you wanna see a good war movie, rent Saving Private Ryan again.",6,0,2,1 August 2010
The Dark Knight," Not your average superhero movie
","I really liked this movie, I liked it a lot, I mean, my expectations weren't that high, I expected action, what I did not expect was the inclusion of more abstract topics than just the good vs evil fight. I can't believe what I'm about to write, but Heath Ledger turned out to be a better Joker than Jack Nicholson, I mean this new Joker was a total psycho, he did those things because he wanted to prove that we all act like animals when we are under pressure and Nicholson's Joker did all those things just because he wanted to, because he was the bad guy. I also liked the twist that Nolan gave to Batman, because we all have this image about superheroes: they are good, innocent guys and everything they do is right, but you really question this when the movie ends. I also didn't expect certain things to happen in the film (Rachel's death, for example)which is good, because it means that the movie is well- written. Can't wait for the next movie, I read that Joseph Gordon Levitt will be Riddler, I don't like him a lot as a villain, but I thought the same about the Joker and Nolan proved me wrong, so I'll just wait and see.",9,0,4,31 July 2010
Avatar," So overrated
","Some say that Avatar is one of the most amazing movies of the decade... I don't think so... For me, the most important part of a movie is its story. The reason why some movies become timeless and unforgettable (The Godfather, Gone with the Wind, Casablanca, Forrest Gump...) is because they are so well- written and so well-directed that you can't imagine how it is gonna end. And what happened when I saw Avatar?? I had the story all figured out before it even started: The good guy infiltrates the NaVi's world by the command of the bad guy in order to find a weak spot so that they can destroy the blue people. Good guy falls in love with girl and finds out that the aliens are good people, then she gets her heart broken when she finds out about his original intentions, they have a big fight, and then good guy decides to protect the NaVi community, they win the fight and live happily ever after... Don't get me wrong, it is visually stunning, it takes creativity to come up with a world like Pandora, but if you take away all of that artwork and technology there's nothing left but a Pocahontas story, but instead of Native Americans you get blue aliens. I also understand that it has an ecological message, but come on, tell us something we don't know.It is a good movie, but it's not THE movie of the decade like some people say it is.",7,2,6,31 July 2010
Braveheart," Every movie is released, not every movie is a hit...
","I've just seen Braveheart on TV, and it is simply a great movie. Mel Gibson gives a great performance. I usually measure the acting of a movie by how the actions of the characters and why they do certain things affect me, how they make me feel , and with this film, I can see through William, I can feel his pain, his bravery, you understand him, you understand why people follow him. And when he shouts 'Freedom!', maybe I overreacted but I seriously got goose bumps So kudos for Gibson. Besides it has a great villain. Longshanks, yeah, I ended up hating that guy. Another good thing is the story, because it has little bit of all: romance, passion, violence, patriotism, it deserves its R rating, but its is justifiable, I think that the film would have been altered in a bad way without those scenes of graphic violence. The story is well-told, the first time I saw this movie was also in TV and I didn't want to get up, every minute is interesting Good cinematography, good costume. A really great movie. Deserved its Oscar",9,3,9,1 August 2010
