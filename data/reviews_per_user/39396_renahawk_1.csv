Ford v Ferrari," I Loved This Movie!
","I went into Ford v Ferrari a little unsure, as I'm not a huge racing fan, and wondered if the movie might be boring to me. My worry was unfounded - Ford v Ferrari is the best movie I've seen all year. It's surprisingly funny, completely engaging, historically accurate, and now my favorite Christian Bale movie. In fact, you'll forget you're watching Matt Damon and Christian Bale as they both completely disappear into their characters. So no spoilers here, just a recommendation to go see a great movie.",10,26,56,7 November 2019
