The Equalizer," So here is another super hero in human form...
","There's no doubt Denzel was able to portray the stoic character of the protagonist. In fact, he did it perfectly, so as to appear that he was the real villain. One would, as usual, expect spectacular effects from such wealthy companies as Sony and Columbia. But the story was disappointing. Here we have an agent who assassinates adversaries perfectly in every situation, with minimal to no damage taken at all. The girl was even set aside in the mid-section of the film and, laughably, re-emerges in the final scene (maybe so as to remind viewers her significance in the film was not fully set aside). Plus, some would find the insertion of a meaningful quote at the beginning baffling. The movie doesn't even provoke pity or, at the very least, understanding of the main character's situation. With so many slow-motion and time-lapses in between scenes, one can vividly picture the aim of the movie; to impress viewers with force, which some people may see as arrogance. It is a commercial action movie though, so most who are satisfied with intense action and little drama would find this film worthy of taking their time.",6,0,0,21 January 2015
Cloverfield," What else would you expect from a Hollywood production company?
","I thought I would be able to like all found footage films. However, this disappointed. The voice acting by the cameraman was so horrible like he was just making fun of it. What's more, there's so much sensationalism in the obviously Hollywood high-budget movie which strips off the suspense and realism. The numerous 'Oh my Gods' are extremely annoying. Plus, the storyline was so bland that it would seem the movie was primarily for showcasing the impressive graphics and simulation technologies at the time. Whatever the case, this isn't even a scary or thrilling movie. So I wouldn't know why they made such a pitiful script for such a high-budget movie. I would like to think of it as a waste of time, but at the very least, it opened my eyes to see how big and wealthy production companies venture into the found footage genre only to end up mostly creating a trying-hard or trying-to-impress movie full of your usual mainstream movie elements; extravagant graphics and annoying sensationalism, two key elements not typically found in the REAL found footage genre.",6,0,0,24 September 2014
Insidious," Scary at some scenes, but not too much.
","I had watched James Wan's The Conjuring before this, so I had high expectations. I am a fan of found footage horror films, but the Conjuring was one of my favorite commercial horror films. The start of Insidious is always good, like in Annabelle, which he also had directed. James knows how to create a very uneasy atmosphere. Insidious was a scary one, but as usual, at the middle towards the end, it gets fast=paced, knowing that the mysteries are being divulged. Plus, the repeated overusing of loud distorted scary orchestra sounds can sometimes be annoying, like it is trying too hard to scare. Near the end of the film, it doesn't get scary, especially since the demon's face is explicitly shown. It looks more like watching an adventure/fantasy film. Overall, I enjoyed this better than Annabelle, but this film is short of scenes that would have made it more well-remembered.",7,0,0,15 February 2015
Evil Dead," Gory scenes make up for the lame story.
","At the first scenes, one would think the movie courts the audience with all of its good-looking actors and actresses. But why would people want to make a movie with a lame-to-useless story just to show how gory and cruel a movie can be? The movie's background was so rushed that I cannot understand why the the group even visited the cabin. In addition, the lead actor is good-looking but his acting style is so bad. His persona and decisions are so dumb that it can be annoying. The flow is fast-paced and there is no element of suspense. At the middle of the film, you already get to know the outcome. The scenes are virtually the same; gory scenes, loud screams and survival. There is so much blood and violence in the movie that one can only imagine how twisted the writers and director were to portray the worst imaginable kind of physical feeling; but that's all about the movie. For people who really enjoy gory and cruel stuff, however bad the story is, then this is for them.",5,1,2,17 October 2014
The Cabin in the Woods," One of the most worthless things to watch.
","I do not get the idea why people would make a movie so worthless. Its story is senseless and extremely lame to say the least. Its primary purpose is to show gore, gore that is done by non-humans; 'monsters' if you will. Like your usual mediocre gory horror movies, the cast is all enticing with youthful good-looking actors and actresses. In this movie though, the acting was fair enough. The movie writers wanted to make a movie that combines technology with old-fashioned backwoods zombies. They thought it was a brilliant idea. All it did was an utter waste of resources. Maybe that's what they wanted after all, since the movie was all about that; futility.",4,3,4,18 October 2014
