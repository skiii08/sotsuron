First Man," An inspiring biopic that will make you appreciate the man it is based on
","The norm of an average biopic is that the person it is based on is deified and the narrative distorted to suit the worshipping of the protagonist and an almost predictable story of rags to riches. There have been many movies about the various NASA missions told from various perspectives but 'First Man' is not like any of them and that is what makes it unique.
'First Man' is an extraordinary inspiring biopic of the first man to set foot on the moon, what I loved about this movie is that the narrative is extremely personal. Neil Armstrong is not portrayed as a 'hero' but as a man who is driven by personal motivations. Ryan Gosling delivers a delicate, nuanced performance as Neil Armstrong, it's his movie through and through.
The direction, screenplay, costumes, set design, background score and cinematography is top-notch. The cinematography, in particular, is just out of this world. The space sequences give a sense of awe and wonder. Honestly, I was on the edge of my seat during the entire Apollo 11 sequence. It gave me goosebumps as it is shot with such precision and accuracy.
This movie was one of my favourites of 2018 as the scale and talent on display here is stellar. Go watch this movie, if you love cinema and appreciate good film-making.",10,3,6,21 February 2019
A Star Is Born," Magic, Pure Magic
","I want to start by saying that I loved this movie and boy was I not expecting that. What Bradley Cooper has created here is magic, pure magic.
It is a love story for the ages and the two leads sparkle with intense chemistry. It is a thrill to watch them on screen. Lady Gaga as Ally is beautiful and brilliant and Bradley Cooper as Jack is so charismatic yet destructive at the time. When they perform 'Shallow' I got goosebumps (Now that is perfect casting). Theirs is a beautiful relationship and it endures a lot of trials. Their love stands rock solid even when Jack loses himself to his addiction. It is heartbreaking to watch and Ally's unconditional love for him made me want to just cry. The music is spectacular, the songs are powerful and the performances is topnotch. It is a tragedy and it is a story of love and at the end 'A Star is Born'",8,2,6,15 February 2019
Captain Marvel," Apprehensions proved wrong
","I had my doubts about this movie from the moment the trailers dropped. It seemed nothing spectacular, which was a shame considering, she is the most powerful superhero in the MCU. But, my apprehensions proved wrong and I really enjoyed the movie. What makes it work despite its many flaws is Captain Marvel herself, she is an interesting protagonist and I sincerely hope they develop her persona more in the future movies of the MCU. I can't wait to see how she deals with Thanos in Endgame. I am all in now.",8,1,4,18 March 2019
Aquaman," Expectations=Reality
","'Arthur goes on a journey of self-discovery to claim his rightful place as the true ruler of the seas'. This is what I expected and it is exactly what I got, So, I am not at all disappointed. It is a fun movie although a little pretentious at times.",7,1,1,11 March 2019
BlacKkKlansman," Powerful, Entertaining, Inspiring
","This story seems so outlandish and impossible, a tale of myth and legend but it is not. It is a true story which is powerful and inspiring and yet highly entertaining. A tough task considering the subject is grave.",9,3,7,18 February 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," A good movie and an Outstanding performance by its lead.
","To call this movie a biography would be inaccurate as the makers have taken many creative liberties, hagiography would be more accurate. Despite that, the movie is highly enjoyable and at the end, I had a deep appreciation for the band, their music, what they stood for and Freddie Mercury. Rami Malek is outstanding, his performance cannot be described by words. The scenes featuring the band members interacting with each other and creating music are like fireworks, spectacular to watch. The 'live-aid' performance which has been meticulously created and executed. It is impossible to not be swept away by the rhythm, for me that was the best part of the movie.",8,1,1,18 February 2019
Justice League," DC Movieverse Redeemed
","I am one of the few people who actually liked 'Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice' even though it was a mess, so I was really looking forward to the Justice League movie to see how it redeems the dc movie- verse.I was pleasantly surprised to see the movie exceeded my expectations.Batman and Wonder Woman are in fantastic form as always. Aquaman is hilariously refreshing. Cyborg (ironically) brings humanity and depth to the group. Even Superman (oops Spoiler) is having such fun, smiling and cracking jokes. The best of the lot is definitely The Flash. Ezra Miller as Barry Allen steals every scene he is in. Barry is so innocent and vulnerable and apprehensive, yet at the same time tries to be brave that he is the most relatable among the lot.There is not much to say about the plot. It is really predictable. The antagonist 'Steppenwolf' is plain ridiculous, but who cares about him when we have such wonderful characters to root for. The entire cast is so likable, and the camaraderie between them is electric and refreshing.They make the movie fun to watch. The JL members are so perfectly cast that I definitely want to see more of them and this movie was the perfect launch-pad. So watch the movie for them. I have much hope for the future movies and am eagerly awaiting them.",8,1,4,20 November 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," The Complete Cinematic Experience
","Where do I even start with this movie? It shattered all my expectations and totally blew my mind with its storytelling, unique background score and immersive visual style. It is not just a spiderman movie, not just an origin story and not just a coming-of-age story. It is all of the above, merged effortlessly to get a refreshingly original unique story. The movie is a true cinematic experience in every sense of the word, it is unlike anything else out there. It has definitely set the bar high, not only for animated movies but for movies in general.",9,0,1,25 February 2019
The Favourite," Did not like it as much as I thought I would
","Three women, out of which two are competing for the third, sets up the stage for a delightful dramedy. The three ladies are all outstanding, their chemistry with each other is so perfect that it is a delight to watch them bicker and romance and seduce each other. The extravagant costumes and the beautiful cinematography add to the overall experience. Despite so many positives, I did not like it as much as I expected.",7,1,1,19 February 2019
Cold War," Reminded me of Casablanca
","A love which has no hope, yet the two people involved are drawn to each other despite the inevitable. Beautifully shot and brilliantly performed with music that touches the soul at its core.",8,2,5,21 February 2019
Green Book," A feel-good movie which hits all the right notes.
","Green book is about an unlikely friendship between two people who are as different as chalk and cheese. It is about humanity, about understanding the other person, being in their shoes and how the simple act of talking to the other person erases all sorts of boundaries. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali slip into the two characters effortlessly, It is a delight to watch the journey of their friendship. Their performances shine and their dynamic with each other is what makes the movie so watchable",8,1,1,18 February 2019
Annihilation," Left me more confused than ever
","Annihilation is a movie which frankly requires a lot of patience to watch and also requires dedicated effort from the viewer to understand it's central themes. I liked it in parts.
The background score is evocative but the visual effects were a hit and miss.
The screenplay, however, left me more confused than ever, I felt that there were a lot of questions unanswered. The writing could have been more coherent and sharper.",7,0,1,13 February 2019
Incredibles 2," The greatest Superhero Family of all time return
","I remember being completely obsessed with 'The Incredibles' way back in 2004, watching it any chance I could get. It was unlike anything at the time, The protagonists were a family of superheroes, which was awesome. It was entertaining and a lot of fun.
The sequel has virtually the same plot, which is a bit of a letdown but the movie is just as entertaining, just as fun. Jack-Jack is the stand-out, he is an absolute delight and it is exciting to uncover all of his superpowers. There are plenty of superheroes with cool powers. The animation is spectacular. The theme-music made me feel like a child again. The makers take the nostalgia and add something to it. My only issue with it is the villain, Who is underwhelming. Which is a pity, considering Pixar has some of the best villains.
Still, I loved this movie because the Incredibles are back and I am ready for more.",8,2,2,22 February 2019
