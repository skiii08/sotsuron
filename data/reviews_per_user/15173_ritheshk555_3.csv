It," Terrifying IT !
","First and foremost, I came across the movie when it's teaser was announced. Then after going across the book, I had high hopes for the film and it's cast, mostly Bill (as the dancing clown) and with expectations, I went to the movie. I enjoyed each frame of the movie, particularly it's cast, their act and the loser club's sense of humour. When it comes to the horror scenes and Bill's acting as Pennywise, he nailed the character with ease. Overall, the perfect horror film in 2017.",10,5,14,10 September 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Avengers Assembled; In a way that exceeds of the first one
","MCU has given us a lot of movies that should be remembered with. A great story-line combined with a lot of humor and Actions sequences to be applauded. Avengers 2 meets its expectations in every way possible way which it has to left from the impressions made by the first one.The plot is that the Avengers unite again to retrieve the scepter of Loki from Hydra and when they do, they unleashes Ultron unknowingly who now obsess with destroying mankind to save the earth in his way. How they stops him is to be watched. Whedon proves again that he is one of the best film maker. From the start till the end the race and the actions never end and makes us watch it at the end of the seat. Davis tries every possible way to make all the crew appear in a way to make them look fantastic. BGM also was great in terms of the critical scenes and made the movie a fast one. The cast was the pivot point of the whole movie. Robert Downey Jr never ceases to me amaze me and this movie also proves his awesomeness. From his intellect & expertise to his timing humor, he perfected the role of Tony Stark. Then to the Head, Chris Evans aka Captain America does all the job by the rules and follows his duty of soldier in this film too. He tries to make the team one till the end and gives precision orders to everyone on the team. Chris Hemsworth proves again that he is the guy with the ability to hold the Hammer. He powers and strikes well to Ultron but he really comes with a touch of humor in most part of the film. Mark Ruffalo played his role as Bruce Banner,mostly Hulk in the film led his acting a great and supporting one to the film. As for Jeremy Renner, his character was given a good & detailed one from his past to his well kept secret. Scarlett Johansson kept her assassin part a nightmare to her enemy. She fights well and keeps her romance also a high and convincing one. As for the twins in the movie, Aaron and Olsen never gives up for each and then the support of their acting to the movie was surprising and refreshing. Other guys played their part subsequently without a hint of boredom and pleases everyone. And then to James Spader, the acting of him in The Blacklist was fantastic and brilliant and it continues to here also. The speech given by him and the voice of him made him, the perfect Antagonist for a such a crew against the heroes. After Loki, ultron proves that he is the villain for the avengers to thrash them and not to go down easily. Overall the film lives to its expectations and provides action sequences like none other. The fight between the Hulk and the Hulkbuster is a very crazy and freaking one with a lot of CG done in a perfect way. The climax was also of its action packed kind and end the film well. Thanos gives us a glimpse of the future of avengers and its fate which is to be waited for another 3 years.",10,18,41,24 April 2015
Furious 7," Adrenaline Coursing through my veins.
","As a F&F fan, I've enjoyed every movie in the franchise excluding F3. But, that movie has an important part and effect to the franchise. And now to the film, It was a full action flick alongside with a tear crying tribute to Paul Walker. From the first race of Leticia to the last scene between O'Connor and Toretto, It was one of the best movie in the franchise. The Core part of the story tells us about good ol' fashioned revenge combined with Speed of NOS and muscle. Deckard Shaw seeks out his kind of style revenge which pulls Toretto and his family into Shaw's world.And so, he combine forces Mr. Nobody to complete a mission for him and in return gets Deckerd Shaw. What happens afterwards, is your's to see. The performance of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker is fantastic. From the Screenplay to their actions, their brother 2 brother relationship was amazing. Michelle Rodriguez played her principal cast perfectly. She had done homework in her fighting and she looks gorgeous as always. Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson played their respective roles well and their chemistry for humor doesn't cease to amaze at most of the times. Rock and Tony Jaa and other's also played their part to their maximum. But Elsa Pataky wasn't given that much to her role. She was a like a cameo appearance but it wasn't that much necessary to include in the whole movie. The graphics and stunts was nearly mind blowing except that the CGI work done for Paul is notable at some times. But, it wasn't that much drawback for the movie as he played his part well and his brother's completed the work he is done. The franchise might have losen a big cast, but it manages to keep the film to the edge of the seat climax. The tribute given by Vin Diesel for him is absolutely superb. It was very touching when he said,'It's never Goodbye' and when they separate in cross roads, it was really amazing to give such an tribute to Paul Walker.Overall, as the franchise keeps promising its Action and Adrenaline, it manages to keep it together even though they lost Paul Walker. A must see for everyone. Try it in a cinema and your money's value will be nicely spent for a good entertainment.",9,79,91,2 April 2015
