Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Modern homage to the Spaghetti Western
","Kill Bill One was a homage to the old Samurai revenge classics. Many of the old martial arts movies including Bruce Lee's first few films focus on revenge being a emotional response to a injustice thereby revenge from Eastern thought is more of a out of control rage.Kill Bill 2 is Tarantino's homage to the Spaghetti Western. Revenge in Western thought should be more about justice and based less on emotion. As the tag line says 'Revenge is a dish best served cold'.Nothing is more 'Americana' in movies than the western and Tarantino does a excellent job of blending the old West with Eastern culture in this film.The whole saga is about revenge, from Bill getting revenge on Kiddo to Kiddo avenging Pai Mai, the old saying holds true that what comes around goes around in this movie.Though not as violent as K.B. One the film does have some great fight's in it but more important are the characters and the lesson that revenge is a vicious cycle of cause and effect.This is a true modern western masterpiece from Q.T. with the focus that there is a fine line between revenge and justice.",9,0,1,10 March 2005
The Last Samurai," Excellent movie on Ethics and Values
","Although the movie portrayed the Samurai as 'simple' mountain people nothing could be further from the truth. The Samurai were aristocratic elites who in this new age of PC correctness would be considered 'Fascist'.However, the value system of duty and honor as well as the concept of what a true warrior is suppose to be is done very well in the film.Outstanding performance by Wantanabe and one of Cruise best he has ever done on film. To my knowledge, speaking myself as a martial artist, this is the ONLY film that portrays the true Way of a Warrior who seeks enlightenment.No other film, (with the possible comic Star Wars films and Kung Fu TV series) portrays the Eastern Warrior arts this way.A great film and a treasure for those who study the warrior arts.",10,2,4,3 May 2005
