The Ring," Great, suspenseful horror film!
","I have watched this movie several times now and I still love it. I want to mention that I have not watched the original version 'Ringu' yet.'The Ring' is very suspenseful. A good story but for me it's the characters that make this movie so very good. Especially the little boy Aiden (David Dorfman), he is so creepy, so much. Great acting! Naomi Watts plays the mother's role very believable in my opinion, a very passionate character who tries everything to save her son.The videotape is very disturbing. This may sound odd but I think the oval-shaped mirror is one of the scariest things I've seen in movies.Samara's story is an interesting one. You want to know what happened to that little girl, why is she doing what she is doing? ....and at the end you don't know whether to call her offender or victim.",8,1,1,9 March 2012
The Notebook," So touching!
","I'm not into romance movies at all, I find them to be too predictable and often just plain boring but I LOVED this movie! I didn't want to watch it at first because I thought it would just be another typical romance movie but now I'm glad I changed my mind and finally watched it!...and I cried like a baby! I have never cried that much over a movie in my life.It's a great love story with amazing characters that you fall in love with immediately. It is full of beautiful and touching scenes. Get your tissues ready, cuddle up with your loved one and watch this wonderful movie!",9,1,2,8 March 2012
The Butterfly Effect," Just...WOW!!
","Great story! Interesting characters! Really good acting! The Butterfly Effect is a movie I can watch again and again and it won't get boring. It's one of a kind, I cannot compare it to another movie because it's different and unique.The movie is very suspenseful and watching it will be a roller-coaster of emotions. There are sad parts, terrifying parts, sweet parts even some funny parts in the movie. I recommended Butterfly Effect to my friends and everyone loved it.Butterfly Effect: AWESOME(!!!) movie from beginning to end! 10/10",10,1,2,9 March 2012
