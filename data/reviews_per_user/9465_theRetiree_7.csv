First Man," If you Thought 2001 Was slow and Solemn
","And Keir Dullea was wooden, get ready for almost two and a half hours of close-ups of Ryan Gosling's eyeballs. I remember watching 2001 when it was released, and the Moon landing when it happened, but movies like Hidden Figures and The Right Stuff give much richer portraits of the time and the people involved. And who can forget Sam Shepard as Chuck Yeager striding away from the crash scene--a much more powerful image than the one depicted here. Yeager, by the way, gets almost no notice here. As with other recent historical movies like The Post, this film would benefit from subtitles identifying some of the true giants who flit almost un-noted through the story.Granted, I loved Claire Foy as QE II, but for my money this is her movie, and she's the emotional center. Maybe she should have married that boring dentist after all.Star Wars gave us space operas full of beat-up junky old crates, and First Man has something of the same feel, with cramped claustrophobic capsules and drab GI offices. Not unlike the new Blade Runner, but Gosling isn't Harrison Ford, and he isn't Sam Shepard either. On a final note, this movie opened nationally just as Gus Grissom's widow finally passed away some fifty years after his heroic death. Folks who get their knickers in a twist about insufficient displays of Americanism in this movie might reflect on how our Great Nation treated the widows and orphans the Space Race cost us.",7,3,7,13 October 2018
Spotlight," Powerful Story, Powerfully Acted
","There is not a bad performance in this dramatically powerful, profoundly sad story of a tiny group of idealists who take on their own religious faith, cultural heritage, and local Authority to defend the weak, violated, and oppressed. This is why some people got into journalism inspired by Watergate and All the President's Men, and why we desperately still need them as a counterbalance to pre-canned viewpoints (including many people on this very movie's message boards who reflexively condemn it before it was even released. There are only a few great journalistic enterprises left in this country still capable of the kind of honest rigor depicted here, and we are all poorer for their absence. See this movie for fabulous acting, see it for an honest portrayal of professional skill and ethics of the highest order, see it to remind yourself of the clich√© that 'all it takes for evil to triumph is for good people to do nothing,' and ask yourself honestly what you would do in similar circumstances, especially if you, like most of us, don't buy ink by the barrel.",9,3,7,22 November 2015
Bridge of Spies," Naturally the Air Force Loves It--Bad History
","One reviewer saw this movie with Air Force brass, who naturally loved it, but almost everything related to the 1950s U-2 program is flat wrong without any obvious reason for the errors. President Eisenhower specifically directed the CIA to develop and manage the program with 'civilian' pilots to avoid committing acts of war by sending military aircraft over foreign countries. Pilots were required to resign from the Air Force, certainly didn't wear uniforms, and were trained at Area 51 (now officially acknowledged) and certainly not in Peshawar Pakistan. Only accurate bits were the grease pencil number on Powers' helmet (they were obviously custom fitted) and the fact that he couldn't destroy the cameras because he got sucked out of the cockpit. All that being said: a great story, great character study, great acting, great if momentary homage to the immortal Billy Wilder and his much more accurate depiction of 1961 Berlin: 'Eins, Zwei, Drei' aka 'One Two Three.' Wilder too presents German dialogue without subtitles, but with him it's much funnier and no less pointed.Well worth watching, especially for Hanks and Rylance, but keep in mind that its no more 'history' than Oliver Stone's 'JFK.' (JFK got shot, Powers got shot down and swapped for Abel.) BTW: Powers got screwed by both the CIA and Air Force, with Kelly Johnson of Lockheed's Skunk Works the only person to stand by him. That's why he wound up flying a traffic copter and running out of gas in 1977. I was there in 2000 when Brigadier General Kevin Chilton, commanding the USAF 9th Reconnaissance Wing at Beale Air Force Base in northern California, gave his son Gary Jr those medals as a way of assuaging the government's guilty conscience.",8,1,3,20 October 2015
Ex Machina," What's the Difference Between God and Nathan?
","As the old joke about the Silicon Valley demi-gods goes: 'God doesn't think he's Nathan.' And Nathan would have been well advised to pay better attention to Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. Be warned, this movie is a cold and cerebral as the terrain and the claustrophobic setting, and has some scenes not for the squeamish or prudish. But for those not easily bored who can actually pay attention to and think about the dialogue and the ideas being explored, its a classic to be compared to Metropolis. If Ava is a machine with 'human'intelligence, then the lesson is to treat her (and all her brothers and sisters) as human beings. Are you ready for this? The same dilemma faced by Harrison Ford in Blade Runner.",8,1,6,25 April 2015
Kong: Skull Island," When will those Pilots Ever Learn?
","So how many King Kong movies will it take before the various pilots learn to STAY OUT OF REACH of those long ape arms??? Five minutes in, every freaking one is toast after presumably surviving an entire year in 'Nam. Even the biplane pilots in the original did better than that! When I was practicing bayonet drills at Fort Benning, the instructor told us he'd never actually used one because he 'always carried plenty of ammunition.' Excellent advice for infantrymen and pilots both. And I never ever saw anybody lugging around an actual record player--see the Air Cav scene in Apocalypse Now for the proper reel-to-reel machine. In general a stupid waste of time and money although its good to see that John Goodman has lost weight and Brie Larson is as lovely as ever, although not as limber as Naomi Watts. Its good Samuel Jackson still has a day job shilling for Capital One, and its good to see John C. Reilly, an under-appreciated actor whose heart got broken by Roxy Hart in Chicago, stealing the show. One only hopes he hung in there long enough to see his beloved Cubbies win it all. But I guess if characters in these movies paid attention to the warning from the guy who'd 'lived there 28 years,' we wouldn't have movies like this.Hummm; maybe not such a bad idea.",5,1,3,1 April 2017
Midway," AF is Short of Water
","One of the few blockbuster war movies to give credit to the oft-maligned intelligence component of World War II, and yes I've read Layton's salty 1985 memoirs. If you like remarkably realistic battle scenes, this movie is for you. As an intelligence professional, I loved the scenes in ICPOA (Intelligence Center Pacific Ocean Area) although for the life of me I still don't completely understand the difference in Layton's role as Nimitz's intelligence chief and Joe Rochford's role as chief of Nimitz's intelligence center. I didn't know he wandered around in a bathrobe but I did know he got screwed by jealous Washington rivals and shipped off to command a drydock on the West Coast. Given that he and Layton were among the fifty (!!) Japanese linguists the Navy had, a shameful waste on many levels. And guess who replaced Rochford? One Commander Roscoe Hillenkoetter, surviving EXO of West Virginia who as naval attache in Paris in 1940 had watched the Germans march in to Paris. After the war, and a stint as captain of USS Missouri, he was appointed by Harry Truman as the first director of the CIA.This movie is like the world's greatest Trivial Pursuit for historians. look, there's CNO Admiral King giving Nimitz the bad news about his next assignment; look: John Ford with his signature round sunglasses madly filming the attack on Midway. Oh, no, that torpedo bounced off the hull of the Japanese warship: wait til the same thing happens at Midway and the torpedo squadron goes down in flames. And having seen MANY photos of Admiral Nimitz, a shout-out to Woody Harrelson, who looked and sounded just like a good ol' Texas boy.",9,50,86,10 November 2019
Sully," Shoulda Known Better
","OK, since I don't get my information about the JFK assassination from Oliver Stone, why do I expect 'truth' from a guy who talks to chairs? Without question the movie is a technical marvel, and I understand that Mike O'Malley has to put food on the table and do what the director tells him to do, but this movie's gratuitous and conspiratorial bashing of career civil servants is going to drive me to Sully's autobiography and the NTSB transcripts. Did they really try to railroad guys who JUST SAVED 155 PEOPLE? Did they really hide the number of (SPOILER ALERT) failed simulations just to get Sully's silver scalp? Seriously? What could possibly be the government's motivation beyond (SPOILER ALERT) 'big gubmint is evil'? And since Clint couldn't find a chair to play the lead villain, he had to find the smarmiest, most supercilious actor possible (again, sorry Mr. O'Malley.) Is this is actually what happened then my apologies, but I'll bet my talking chair that it's not. Some fictionalizations are harmless, and some, like 'Eyes in the Sky' are really on the money about how bureaucracts work, but are there really no honorable and honest people in NTSB? Anybody at NTSB want to offer a review?OK, after posting, I did indeed go to the web and read the extremely interesting and balanced NTSB accident report. Did I find the slightest criticism of Sully? Noooooo. Did I find any indications of efforts to blame him? Noooooo. I am so sick and tired of the sloppy and easy default of painting hard-working, conscientious people as villains just because they, gasp, are trying to keep the flying public safe by looking into accidents. In the report, the real villains are eight pound geese and overly long and cumbersome checklists, but I guess that ain't dramatic enough for ol' Clint.",4,14,29,13 September 2016
