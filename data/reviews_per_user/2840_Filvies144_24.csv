Million Dollar Arm," Great movie!
","I love this movie! The movie is about a sports agent that goes to India to find a new pitcher. This operation is called ''Million dollar arm''. He finds two pitchers and brings them back to the U.S. This movie is very original (Based on a true story) and it makes a good family film. Its also very funny (But it's not a comedy). It can make some people laugh just as it's a good family film. I am so letting my kids watch it when I have kids. Best 2014 movie ever! Godzilla 2014 was trash, so get this movie instead. It disgusts me that IMDb only rated this 7.1. That's underrated in my opinion. This film is rated PG for Language,and some sexual suggestion. PG is not bad rating for family. I recommend this for 8 and older",9,1,1,21 November 2014
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Slightly disappointing...
","This movie wasn't great, but it was still pretty watchable. It was shorter than the first and second movies because Mocking-Jay is in 2 parts. This might've been better if Mocking-Jay was only done in one film because they are doing two parts just to make more money. In this one, Katniss is not in the Hunger games, but she is forming an alliance against the capitol. The 'Slightly disappointing' part about it is that I thought it was going to be long, but it actually is pretty short. The good thing about it is the acting, action, and few other stuff. Its weird how this film is 2 hours and it was short. Godzilla 2014 was 2 hours, but it went on forever. I hope the second part has more action because I heard there's probably going to be more action. So overall this movie was good, but just not good enough.",6,13,24,22 November 2014
Iron Man 3," Special effects don't always make up for extreme overratedness
","I'm not a huge fan of Marvel, since I've only seen a few. Captain America was nice, age of ultron was good, iron man 2 was OK, and I've seen this one. It was released in 2013 to high amounts of praise. But I think it's over-hyped. And here's whyThe story in this film is about terrorists about to completely take over the U.S., and it suddenly starts to focusing on people that can burst into flames. See, this is super disorganized this film is? What makes it more choppy is the fact that Tony Starks home was under attack, then he gets in his suit unconscious, flys off, and wakes up in a totally different place. I thought while seeing that, what just happened? Things get more disorganized for reasons that will spoil the film. The writing is just super choppy, disorganized, and a bit confusing. It goes on like this for so long and it just makes me wonder what the heck is happening here. There is not much logic. Its just super messy and just doesn't make sense.The special effects look super great. I will not lie, it just gets you excited and hyped during the action scenes. It's another big budgeted set of special effects that played off. The iron man suit looks great and it really gets you. The only problem I have with it is the fact that the action scenes makes you think about the cgi in the movie. So overall, the effects have a lot of effort.The characters in the movie are flimsy just like the movie. For the main character Tony Stark, instead of learning more like in the second one, he's just the ordinary hero. The kid in the movie serves more of a plot device and is a bit bland. The rest of the characters are mostly forgettable like the people who can burst into flames and more. So there's not much to offer with these guys. There just isn't. So overall, Iron man 3 is one of marvels worst films. It may have done things right like the special effects are great, and the acting is good . But it's not enough to save it from its lackluster writing, and bland characters. Iron man 3 is so over-hyped that I think some people were a bit harsh on the second one. So bottom line: Its a waste of a screenplay, a waste of characters we watch for two hours, and it's overall a bad film. Rating: D+ = 3.5/10One more thing: This movie was so confusing that I even wrote a factual error about the plot that I had to remove. Well, I hope that doesn't happen again.",3,2,5,14 November 2015
The Maze Runner," Entertaining really, but still flawed.
","I haven't seen the second film, Scorch Trials, but I have seen this one (That's why I'm writing the review, duh). But know that I think of this film, it's a mix between the March 2014 Sci-Fi Divergent and the 1998 Jim Carrey Comedy, The Truman Show. I will explain the similarities soon in this review. BTW, I've never read the books, but when I watched it, it felt like I didn't need to.In the story, a teen stumbles upon other teens around him all trapped in an area with walls surrounding it (See, the Truman show similarity?). Everyone in the area called the Glade has no memory of why they are there, but they try use this electronic maze to get out, which included 3 years of failed attempts. Its like putting the characters of Divergent in a Truman show like environment. Actually, it's an enjoyable film with the good execution and it's even thought provoking. But one plot hole is this: The Glade has some trees in it, yet the people there never tried building a ladder to bypass the wall (it isn't a dome, unlike the Truman show). Not a single one of the Teens figures this out. Isn't that just moronic? But even with that, it also has some twists, like a condition where a person would go insane and will have to be killed in the maze, and the condition is caused by a 'Sting'. So overall, things do get a little creative here, even with similarities to other films, but it does have some issues like that plot hole.The special effects are very effective I should say. Get it? But seriously, for 32 million dollar budget, it looks amazing. The technology in the film like the maze, the grievers, and more don't look cheap. The effects look artistic and look like very special effects. Get it? Okay, enough with the puns. But still, don't expect awful CGI creatures that look like Jar Jar Binks or that lazy CGI dog from the 2002 Scooby Doo.The characters in the film. Ah, not so great. The protagonist Thomas seems to be like the confused Teenager that is actually be very helpful, but he's treated badly in the Glade like an idiot. I think that he's a pretty good character, actually. Other than a few exceptions, the rest of the teens in the glade aren't very smart. Like I said earlier, they never figured out about a ladder ever and are huge jerks to Thomas. Plus, they are pretty bland. BTW, I can't tell you about more important characters because they will spoil the movie, who actually are pretty interesting. So overall, some characters are good, others, not so much.So overall, The Maze Runner has an enjoyable plot, Great Special effects, but not so great characters. Oh, and FYI, I can review the Truman show and Divergent soon to share my thoughts on those.",7,0,0,12 February 2016
Zootopia," We need more Disney films like this!
","In a year full of animated films, a majority of them feature a big cast of animals. Like previously, we had Norm of the North and Kung Fu Panda 3, and we are going to get even more with The Angry Birds movie, Finding Dory, The Secret Life of Pets, Storks, and Sing. But Zootopia is a masterpiece and looks like it's going to win an Oscar. I personally thought it was great. Why is that so? The film has an excellent message about not to judge others despite any limitations. It perfectly brings out this message very deeply. That's not all. The story is highly well crafted through the characters experiences and the twists that come. Many of the scenes are twists that make the story so unpredictable that it surprises you deeply throughout. In fact, the villain (Who I simply can't spoil) gets revealed after several other characters we thought were the villain weren't. These twists are very clever, the message is deep and strong, the humor is hilarious, and this makes perfect writing.The animation is unbelievable. It shows all the parts of Zootopia, the backgrounds are amazing, and the character design is a delight. Remember how The Lego Movie had amazing CGI that surpassed Pixar quality even? Well this is just as great, and looks even better than the special effects of Star Wars: TFA.Also, the characters have so much depth and are very dynamic. Judy Hopps is the perfect role model for people everywhere, not giving up her dreams when bullied by others, and is enthusiastic to 'Make the world a better place'. Nick Wilde starts off as a jerk, but later has a back story similar to Judy's that develops him, and becomes a good friend. With the exception of a few minor characters, many of the other characters are important, dynamic, and strong. I'm talking characters like Chief Bogo, Mr. Biggs, and more. The villain (Major Spoilers, not going to tell) is clever because it is revealed after many twists and turns. These are just highly unforgettable characters.This is the best animated film I've seen since Toy Story 3 because of it's great writing, outstanding animation, and unforgettable characters. It's even better than Inside Out, and it's the best Disney film I've seen along with Fantasia and The Lion King. It will likely sweep the Oscars due to it's success and will be remembered for a long time. I never thought I would see a modern Disney film that would be a 10/10 for me. So bottom line: Watch it in theaters now, it's a must see.",10,3,11,25 March 2016
Captain America: Civil War," The best Marvel movie I've seen
","I'm not a big fan of the MCU films, but on this weekend, I chose to watch it instead of The Angry Birds Movie (which is getting ugly reviews). But anyways, I thought it was great, much better than any other MCU film I've seen. Here's why.I found the story in this movie solid. It was entertaining, it mostly made sense, and it was funny. In it, the world considers Super Heroes dangerous, so Iron Man wants limit to their actions, and Captain America doesn't, which causes conflict between the two. But in the process, a threat rises. I find it also deep, and well craft. Age of Ultron's story on the other hand, was simple compared to this, and not solid. But one flaw I find is there are a couple of plot holes. But I won't tell them, because it might be a spoiler.The characters in the movie are more dynamic than they are in other MCU films. There is clearly some struggle in them, and with good reason. Also, the special effects in this movie are amazing, and very realistic and believable, despite the CGI.So overall, I recommend this movie to anyone over 10, even non-Marvel fans. It is amazing, and I consider it better than Star Wars: The Force Awakens.",9,1,6,21 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," A Harry Potter based film without Harry Potter? No problem.
","Originality is nearly non-existent in the movie industry now a days since sequels, spin-offs, prequels, and Remakes dominate. But I do usually see them because the originals are good. Checking this out in theaters for me didn't require any trailers, because its based on the Harry Potter universe. What's not to like about that?This film is set in the same universe as Harry Potter, except in 1926, in New York. It is centered on the wizard Newt Scamander, who brings magical a suitcase containing Magical Creatures to New York, but when the creatures come loose, its up to him and his friends to get them back to avoid getting exposed to non magical people. The movie mostly has a good pace, and is fun. It also introduces interesting ideas to the universe, which really got me intrigued. However, it can be confusing, and hard to get into at first. When I watched it, it took me 10-15 minutes to understand it. But those little nitpicks don't take away the good writing this film has.For the characters of this film, they are a pretty enjoyable cast. The main character Newt (I'm just going to be honest) is a moron. Seriously why would anyone think that bringing a suitcase of magical creatures that isn't 100% secure to a city of non magical people is a wonderful idea? However, he is a fun character with a goofy personality and if great to follow. Also joining the adventure, is the auror Tina and her sister Queenie, who are likable and contribute to the adventure. But my favorite character is Jacob, who is a no-maj(non magical person) who gets involved in the adventure and helps Newt. I liked how he has a goofy personality and is very funny. The fantastic beasts in the movie are also really funny, and cute as well. I only mentioned those because the rest of the cast involves spoilers, but the characters are overall pleasant additions to the Harry Potter universe.The visual effects in this movie are better than shown in the other 8 Harry Potter movies. The budget is 180 million and it shows. The design of the animals are brilliant, (just to avoid the 'fantastic' pun)with unique abilities, and they all stand out rather than simply having dragons. Other magic in the film is unique (like the suitcase). I like how this film used many more of these ideas to bring to life and doesn't make it stand out as much in the action scenes or use gimmicks (unlike the other Harry Potter films). So overall, brilliant visual effects to add to this film.After the Harry Potter films, I didn't expect this spin-off to be this good, but I was wrong. The movie is overall a holiday treat with a Fun story and characters, interesting ideas, and awesome effects. It is a recommendation from me indeed, and after this, we'll see if the next spin-off coming to theaters near us, Rouge One: A Star Wars Story, can top this.",9,21,47,25 November 2016
Inside Out," Pixar may be coming back.
","Lately, Pixar hasn't created anything considered perfect since Toy story 3. Cars 2 and Monsters university weren't great and didn't live up to others. But now we have this film, which is one of two Pixar films this year.When I saw this film, there was a theatrical short called 'Lava'. The short was actually awful, un-entertaining, and was like a romance music video. I give that one a 2/10.OK, on to Inside out. The film was fun, funny, and even a little complicated like the Toy story films. Before this film was released, I really doubted this film, thinking the concept would be unappealing and the writing might not be good. But this bashed my low expectations. I liked the adventure in this film because the backgrounds were excellent and made me feel like I was either in San Francisco or inside Riley's brain. The animation also made the emotions look cute, but the thing about this film is, like other Pixar films, it starred human characters in it, but the animation just creates good looking humans because its not always a good idea t make your animated film look as real as possible like 'The Polar express'. As for the characters, the emotions are sometimes funny and a little lovable. One problem is that I feel like the emotions have emotions of their own. Like there are scenes where Sadness and Anger smile like they're happy. That makes no sense since they're supposed to feel their own emotion since Joy is called Joy for example.This film doesn't have a good theatrical short, but it is still great movie that makes up for Pixar's previous disappointments (Cars 2, anyone?), and manages to blow away doubts. I hope Pixar continues this comeback with the Good dinosaur this Fall. Kinda hard to believe that Pixar would release 2 films in one year when during previous years it would be one at a time. Update July 26: When I created this review 3 weeks ago, I noticed a lot of negative reviews even though it has a 8.7 average rating. Its sad to see it have all this undeserved hate. At least tons of others have the critics point of view for this film. Plus, all this hate is coming from people who thought it was 'sad'. Sure they do have an opinion but this movie is still clever even when some parts like Bing bongs entire storyline is sad. If you watch the first 10 minutes of Up, you may understand that sad is sometimes sad in a good way. I can't wait for its home release then I can watch it over and over again.Update: This stupid troll is still going. Its down to a a8.4! WHY?Anyway, I'd like to thank the people who gave this at least a 7/10. Its beautiful and heartwarming and deserves to be in any animation hall of fame. Its just amazingSO DON'T LISTEN TO HATERS, EVERYONE! JUST BECAUSE ITS MORE SUITABLE FOR OLDER CHILDREN DOSEN'T MEAN ITS A BAD FILM! Oh, and one more FYI, its better for kids then that horrible Cat in the hat movie (This film has no adult jokes).Story: 9/10 Animation: 9/10 Characters: 10/109/10",9,13,40,6 July 2015
Cars," Awesome
","Cars is a really entertaining and delightful movie. I like how all the characters are cars (But some back-round characters are planes or trains). This is much better than Cars 2 as well. The credits are the best credits I had ever seen because normally credits are boring. One thing I don't like about Cars is that Mater is a very very VERY annoying character. Another thing that I don't like is that Lightning McQueen is treated so unfairly in Raidiator Springs. Speaking of the credits, they show a car version of Toy Story (Toy car story.) Monster inc (Monster truck inc.) and A bugs life (A bugs life) during the credits. This the 3rd best Pixar film in my opinion. The best Pixar film in my opinion is Toy story 2 and the runner up is Toy story. This is a film that is good for all ages.",8,0,0,12 December 2014
Cars 2," What a sequel to a great movie!
","I do not hate this movie, but Pixar sure created a weak one. The first Cars was enjoyable, while this was confusing and hard to follow. But at least its better than Wall.E, which is completely stupid and doesn't entertain. The main character is everyone's favorite tow truck, Mater. Mater is very annoying and not that funny, and they just don't focus enough on Mc-queen. But the trailer at least looked better than Planes (I haven't seen it, but I don't want to because it looks dumb and it gets a lot of hate.) I hope Cars 3 improves from this because if it doesn't, the franchise is dead. The story is an oil spill compared to the first because they had to ad spies. I think this is Pixar's second worst film.",5,0,1,14 March 2015
X-Men: Apocalypse," Its not amazing, but the critics were too harsh.
","This was actually my first time watching an X-men movie. I never seemed to be interested in the movie series from X-men 2000 to X-men Days of Future past. But like Captain America Civil War, (which is a great super hero movie, a must see) I once again chose to see this over the Angry Birds movie. But that's not the point. I came in with low expectations, expecting it to be only a little better than 2015s non MCU Marvel film Fantastic 4 (which is underrated, but still not good). But I actually found it quite good. Here's why:I found the story in it a rather interesting story that puts you close to the edge of the seat. It includes very funny humor, backstory that doesn't fall at a boring level, and intense , but riveting action scenes. One issue is that the bland characters (which I will get into) gives this interesting story a stale and bland side, but that still doesn't destroy this riveting action movie, Like I said, the characters in the movie are mostly bland, but with little exception. Charles Xavier, for instance is like Nick Fury from MCU films, but he lacks big personality. Raven is also a pretty bland character, and I think the writers /directors could've used the character and Jennifer Lawerence better. But some exceptions are some comic reliefs that are actually funny, and provide most of the great humor the movie has to offer. The villain Apocalypse, lacks a big villain build up, and lacks a personality, but he does have great reasoning for being a villain. In fact, it may b a character a lot of people could possibly root for.So overall, I think that this film is worth your time with Great special effects that look very believable in it's effort, and a great story and humor. It's not as good as Civil War, but it's fun exciting and exciting, trust me.",8,11,19,31 May 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy," Guardians of the galaxy
","This was a funny and good movie. But I don't know why they decided to put comedy in a Marvel movie because Marvel movies are susposed to be serious the whole way through. This is the best marvel movie so far, but the only marvel movies I have watched other than this is Captain America(2011), The Avengers, and a little of Incredible Hulk. I give this movie a 7.5/10. The reason I give this a 7.5/10 is because it was a little boring in the middle and I wasn't 100% sold on the characters. What I liked about the movie was the humor, the special effects, etc. Unlike The Avengers, they sort of killed of a character because SPOILER ALERT: Groot dies, but one of his parts is planted and he becomes a small plant. So overall, it was a good movie. It gets a 7.5/10",8,0,3,21 December 2014
Jurassic World," A Jurrasic comeback; way better than the 3rd one, however predictable
","I watched this movie today. It was enjoyable, it kept the spirit of the original, and way better than the abomination and disappointment that was Jurassic park 3.Jurassic world, the 4th installment to the series manages to return to the ways of the original Jurassic Park because it had a story about the theme park being open to the public, yet things go awry with a new dinosaur creation. The only problem I had with this was that the story felt like a modern copy of the original Jurassic Park, there are plot holes, and the first half was clichéd, but it was still fun and worth watching. But the characters weren't really amusing or worth remembering except for Owen, who is easily the best one. The other sequels, the lost world and Jurassic park 3 have barely any connection with this and they were pointless. Like if you watch the first Jurassic park and then watch this, you wouldn't miss any plot points. The special effects are great like other modern day. films by the way as well. If you liked the first one, you may like this. Don't expect too much, but you can give it a try if you want to watch it.",6,5,18,19 June 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Good, but could've been better
","I saw it today. I may have been a little late to see it since it was released on May 1st, but at least I didn't miss it.Anyway, this film was a little enjoyable and watchable, but it could've had better writing. The story is just not the most original because its like Tony Stark/Iron man creates ultron, it turns out ultron is bad, and the avengers must defeat him. Most of the action scenes are fun, but a couple are a little meaningless. The effects and scenery are still great. As for the characters, Ultron, the villain is well written, but not as great as Loki. The odd thing is that Tony Stark/Iron man is like the main character in an avengers film. Luckily, the other super heroes do get enough time on screen, but if there were TOO MUCH focus on Tony Stark/Iron man, it would be something like a 4th installment to the Iron man series. The Avengers were pretty much assembled the whole time, and Nick Fury only appears for a maximum of 10 minutes. The ending wasn't all that great, either. The effects are great as always, but the writing needs work.7/10",7,1,7,6 June 2015
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Great movie, my favorite of the franchise
","The first Home Alone was liked by everybody. I liked the first one but this is awesome. I like the adventure in this one, in fact this is better than Home Alone 1. Everybody thinks Home Alone 1 was better than this, but I think this is a little better. The booby traps were even better than the original, like there was one where Marv was electrocuted. I didn't think Home Alone 3 was bad, but Home Alone 4 was a complete disaster. Its strange how this can be called ''Home Alone 2'' even though kevin is not in his own house. A 6.5/10 is underrated, so I think that should be raised a little bit more. At least they had the same criminals as the first one, because 3 had different criminals. That's all I can say, so overall, this movie was a great movie.I give this a 8.5/10",9,4,6,2 December 2014
The Secret Life of Pets," An improvement over Minions, but absolutely not perfect.
","This film is from illumination entertainment, which recently created the first non Disney animated film to crack 1 Billion worldwide, Minions. For my thoughts on the studio, Despicable me 1, and 2 were great, Hop was OK, but forgettable, but The Lorax and especially Minions were bad. Then this film came along.Easily the weakest part is the writing. It rips off Toy Story using the same concept except with pets, which makes this movie very predictable, often in the first hour. It however, becomes a lot less predictable in the 3rd act, which gives it some suspense. This is also a problem with Independence day resurgence, but unlike that movie, the concept is well executed, which makes this movie entertaining. I had a good time watching it because of that. But overall, this writing is mediocre.The characters in this movie are one of my favorite parts. Max is, however the weaker one who is like Woody from Toy Story, who is a jerk to his companion at first, but then grows to be friends with him. The rest of the characters are all lovable and enjoyable to watch, suck as Duke, Gidget, Chloe, and more. But my favorite one is the bunny Snowball, who is the funniest, with Kevin Hart making a good performance as the bunny that looks cute but has a violent personality, making him the villain.New York City is one of my favorite cities in the world, and New York looks like nothing I've ever seen before. It perfectly shows all the attractions such as the One World Trade Center, Times square, Central Park, and Brooklin in way I've never seen in animation. Also, the design of the pets are accurate as they are both cute and well designed. The only part I don't like about the animation is the human design, which is always rather weak in Illumination movies. Along with this high quality animation, the humor hits a lot, with very smart gags, and not the very unfunny slapstick in Minions and it also takes a break from DreamWorks like Crass humor. There is an animated short that plays before this called 'Mower Minions', which is OK and cute, its just that the humor isn't funny, just like the Minions film.The writing may be weak, but the film is enjoyable with memorable characters, and smart and funny gags. The animation is also breathtaking as heck. I recommend to kids and adults. It may not be as smart as Zootopia, or as unforgettable as Finding Dory, but it is a good addition to the summer.",8,9,17,16 July 2016
Finding Dory," A sequel on par with if not, bettet than the original
","I saw Finding Dory several weeks ago, and I have to admit, I can be slow at making reviews, but that's not the point. I really enjoy Finding Nemo for its great concept, humor, and heart. Similar to the gap between Toy Story 2 (1999) and 3 (2010), this comes 13 years after the original. Because of the long gap and how most sequels aren't as good as the original, I thought I would enjoy it but it wouldn't be as good as the original. I was wrong, and here's why:In this movie, Dory, (the blue tang who suffers from short term 'remembery' loss) remembers that she has a family and sets off to find them with her two friends, the clownfish father and son Marlin and Nemo, and Dory (while trying to find her family) gets separated from Marlin and Nemo, and the father and son duo must FIND DORY (get it). From this summary, I will admit it has similarities to the original, and it can get a little predictable. However, the story has depth, (no pun intended) and true heart of a Pixar movie, especially when we see Dory's struggle with short term 'remembery' (I meant memory) loss. It is also enjoyable, with some cleverness and it isn't very predictable.As for the characters, everyone's favorite blue tang is back, and she's better than ever. She's three dimensional, therefore well developed, and still very enjoyable with a good personality. However, Marlin and Nemo are still enjoyable and funny, however not as well developed as Dory in this one. Hank the octopus (or septopus) is a very funny character who is grouchy, but later shows that he does in fact have three hearts. Destiny and Bailey are like the tank gang, and are enjoyable as well, however not as great. Mr. Ray is as funny as ever, and other characters from the first one get cameos. This may not be the best cast of characters, but it is good to see some old ones again.For other things, the animation is better than terrific. It upgraded the original animation by giving out even better textures, backgrounds, and design. Pixar delivered a whole new level of high by animating Hank and his camouflage well and detailed. Also the humor is really funny, mainly from Marlin, (no pun intended)Mr. Ray, Dory, and Hank.Finding Dory isn't as good as Zootopi, but is close with a 3 dimensional plot, characters that not even Dory herself could forget, and stellar animation. I definitely recommend it. Pixar has rebounded from the let down the good dinosaur.",9,2,11,5 August 2016
Blade Runner," A complete waste of time and effort.
","The most praised movie of 1982 (Along with ET of course) gets a 8.2 average rating on this database you are on right now. How could it be that high? I mean this is a complete garbage film that is so overrated. And heres why: In 2019, Earth has been rebuilt and Los Angeles becomes a dark and depressing area or 'colony'. A group of replicants (robots who look like humans) from outside of Earth steal a spaceship to get to Earth to meet their creator and murder people. Then the police call a retired employee, Deckard a Blade Runner (A person who kills replicants) to kill the replicants. Why is it so moronic? Well, there are a series of plot holes: One plot hole is that there are said to be six replicants at first, but then for some reason even when none have been killed, it is said to be 4 with no explanation. There is also no reason for the replicants to be murdering a bunch of random people. Plus because of reasons that will spoil this film, wouldn't the geniuses that created the replicants build them so that they won't kill people and steal spaceships? This is completely illogical and idiotic. That's not all. The film is also VERY BORING. Even though I watched the whole movie, I lost interest in the first 10 minutes and nearly fell sleep. I mean there's not much action. It's just a bunch of talk 11/12ths of the time. And not interesting talk like the Indiana Jones films. So overall, this is pitiful. It also lacks strong emotion, heart, and development. So overall story of the movie is so depressing, dark, cruel, very boring, and is completely illogical.There's also the characters. Oh my gosh, this is sad. The replicants in the film (Roy, Leon, etc.). Lemme just say that they have no personality. Sure they're robots, but maybe they shouldn't have been so bland. Y'all may disagree, but I think they should've had a big personality like Bender from Futurama did to make them more interesting. Harrison Ford was wasted because he would underact and sound bored while playing Deckard. Deckard is charmless, and bland. The creator of the Replicants amazes me because of how forgettable he is. Then there's Sebastian. He's actually a 25 year old who do to health problems looks so old, but he does collect toys and show a smile, which is why he is the best character of the movie. So yeah, these characters are so boring, undeveloped, and such that it is just unappealing.That's your answer. Blade Runner is the steaming pile of crud. The writing is abysmal, and the characters are so bland. It is so boring that I was so close to falling asleep. One of the only redeeming qualities I didn't mention before was a Star Wars reference when you can hear a Chewbacca growl at one part, which is a very small pro but adds a little Star Wars, which is why better than this Atrocity and has everything this doesn't: A well crafted story, memorable characters, a little heart, and lots of charm.2/10",2,4,10,14 February 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The most anticipated movie of the year, and how it turned out
","Yeah, I know how people who haven't seen this don't want to see any spoilers. I will only write one small spoiler here (I'll warn you when it comes, so read on), but i will tell you what I thought of it. It was actually the first live action (Not clone wars animated stuff) Star Wars theatrical movie since Revenge of the sith. So how was it? The story in this movie takes place 30 years after Return of the Jedi and focuses on what happens in the future of Luke, Leia, and Han's galaxy, which in the movie is not only expanded, (The desert planet in the trailer was not Tatooine, for example) but features new characters that we focus on throughout. The concept of an expansion to the original trilogy is very engaging, drags people to theaters, and gets people talking about it. Its actually a well executed and much more enjoying than the awful Phantom menace and Attack of the clones. Is it perfect? No. One reason is that it is way too similar to a New Hope. It may sound awesome, but it just takes away any suspense by making it so predictable. But can it be funny even if the trailer insists its an action drama. Yes, because there were some parts that just made me laugh (Even those parts are spoilers, there are so funny). Also, there were a couple of plot holes and questions it leaves that are problems. The story overall can be clumsy for its predictability, unoriginal , with a couple of plot holes, but it is enjoyable for its great execution and nostalgia of the original trilogy.The special effects, are out of this galaxy far, far, away. I've heard before release that director JJ Adams tried to use as little CGI as possible. Even if there was still some, it sure delivered. The special effects, are epic, from the TIE fighters to the explosions, and the controlled (Non CGI) robot used for BB8. Unlike the Marvel films where the effects are epic but have so much CGI that it makes you think about it all 2 1/2 hours, this didn't have a lot of that and also had less ugly CGI aliens than Phantom Menace. So overall, these are effects some directors should take into consideration.The characters in this movie are the following: The main character, Rey, starts off doing things similar to what Katniss Everdeen did in District 12 like getting food, for instance, then proceeds to become involved in an adventure. She's not really as appealing as Luke Skywalker, but she is still a good character. There's the other main character, Finn, who is actually a better character because of choosing to be good instead of evil, which makes him a great guy actually. Han Solo is great to see again because he was one of my favorite characters in ep. 4-6. But the problem with him is that he may be a bit like the old man who was once a hero but now a grumpy person, but still a good character. However he gets character development at one point, but it would be spoiler galore to tell you guys. Chewbacca is in it as well, and is also nice to see again, and still pretty helpful and lovable. As for the rest, Leia does appear, but is more quiet in this one than in previous films, and doesn't develop really. Lovable droids C3-PO and R2-D2 are barley in it at all, but are nice to see on the big screen again, making it a positive appearance. Then there's the villain, Kylo Ren. He actually isn't that amazing of a character because he is powerful with his helmet on, but (Small spoiler) actually kind of wimpy with it off (At one point). But he does have a great struggle, making feel like a real character, far more real than Dooku or Darth Maul. There's one character named Poe, who's important in the first 30 minutes, but then the film seems to forget about him for a while. Finally, there's BB8, the droid with a sphere bottom and a half oval head we see in the trailer. He's very interesting in the first half for reasons I won't get into, but then those reasons tone down, but he's still a cute and helpful little droid to be in it. But most of the characters overall are great.So overall, the Force Awakens is a good holiday treat to watch in theaters. An improvement to the prequels obviously, but not as good as the original 4-6 movies. But for this weekend of movies, I took it over Alvin and the Chipmunks: the Road Chip because seeing the force re-awaken for the 7th Star Wars film would be more enjoyable for me than hearing atrocious Chipmunk talking/singing for 90 minutes. Seriously, how come they released their 4th film at the same time as this? So Star Wars fans can see it, but they should maybe lower the high expectations a bit because of its flaws.",8,1,14,19 December 2015
Godzilla," lame and tedious
","This movie was a huge waste of time! It was really boring in the start of the movie and it goes really off topic of ''Godzilla'' at one point. I was excited for this movie, and it was really disappointing. It was only two hours, but the movie from start to finish felt like 3 hours. Plus,Godzilla only makes an appearance for little time, so this shouldn't be called Godzilla. I would highly recommend Million dollar arm if you want to watch a 2014 movie. That's much better than this piece of junk! For the 2nd Godzilla coming out in 2018, they should hire a new director, a new producer, and some new script writers to change the movie so that it's not so boring and actually has more action. This film should be called ''Borezilla'' PS: (If you like this movie, please don't be offended;its my opinion)",3,2,6,21 November 2014
Minions," Watch Inside out, not dull, horrible, cheap, lazy, unfunny, heart lacking cash in
","Now I really liked the Despicable me movies, but now that the minions got their own movie, lets take a look. First off, I'd like to say that this film can be predictable at times and a bit fast paced, and the film gets really dull. Most of the jokes are cheap too. Like, the only chuckle worthy and best jokes are in the trailers. The way how the 3 minions are trying to find a villain for a leader makes no sense because since the other bosses weren't evil or in-fact animals, there's no reason why they should find a villain if their fine with a bear being their leader. Plus this film lacks heart. There's isn't any real drama or heartwarming moments unlike Inside Out, which has them. The best parts of the movie were the first 30 minutes of it, which is probably the only redeemer other than that great music that brings a feel to the 60s. But this story is seriously pitiful.The animation looks pretty good like the backgrounds are great, but the character design is decent but very simplistic as always., but as for the characters, the minions are extremely cute,(Bob is my favorite, he's so cute!)but one dimensional. Scarlet feels too over the top and forgettable/bland at the same time, and the rest of the human characters are forgettable. Like the actor Michael Kenton was totally wasted playing a minor character whose only purpose is to bring the Minions to the Villain con.So bottom line: This film is a lazy cash in and the D me films were better. The story is lazy, lacks heart, and is boring and unfunny. The animation does look good, but the characters are one dimensional/ My recommendation is: If you want to watch it just rent it. Inside out is better than this. Adults should watch inside out, avoid this. It's only amusing to 6 year olds. 3/10",3,0,0,5 August 2015
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Great movie, my favorite of the franchise
","That's right, folks! It is slightly better than the amazing film, Raiders of the lost ark! Its also an improvement from Temple of doom as well. But here's why its so great In this, the prologue takes place with young Indy's adventure in 1912, which is fun and interesting to see Indy as a boy scout escaping from gangsters. The rest of the movie takes place 2 years after Raiders in 1938, where Indy must hunt for the holy grail before the Nazis and find his missing father. OK, I admit that it is like Raiders, but I am totally fine with it because Raiders is an amazing film, and this is a well executed film that is linked with it. Unlike Temple of doom, its a sequel that actually follows raiders and has Marcus Brody, Sallah, and Nazis, making this related to Raiders. But the only problem is that there were some plot holes in the 3rd act (I won't spoil it). But other than that, its much more pleasant and great than seeing monkey brains being eaten and children being enslaved, and having an annoying love interest like in Temple of doom.The special effects are great as always. But the only problem is that in one flying scene, it looked fake. So great special effects that look great are a great addition to a great movie (That may've sounded ridiculous).The characters in this are great as well. Indiana Jones is charming as always and fun to follow on his adventure. Marcus Brody is very helpful and smart, but I've always noticed that every movie that character is in, it turns out amazing. Then there's my favorite character in the movie, Henry Jones Sr played by erstwhile James Bond, Sean Connery. Not only is he charming, but he's smart, funny, (especially 'Junior')and extremely helpful. The Nazis (not the same ones in Raiders of the lost ark)are greedy like in Raiders, but they are great as villains because they are fierce for power and memorable. There's Sallah (who was in Raiders as well) who is kind and helpful, making him a great character once again. The only character that's kind of in the middle is Elsa Schnider, the 'love interest' that turns out to be a Nazi villain like Donovan. Sometimes I just feel like she switches sides a lot like I was confused that at the Nazis burning the books, she looked upset watching then the next time we see her, she's loyal to the Nazis. Se is a kind of OK villain, but it just leaves me a little confused. So overall, there truly is a great set of characters.The last crusade is my favorite of the franchise. It is the most exciting, with great characters. I am surprised that some people think Temple of doom is better. I think not. I notice that Raiders of the lost ark is to The last crusade as Home alone is to Home alone 2. Well, Last crusade isn't exactly like Raiders of the lost ark, but they are similar in their own franchise. So if you liked Raiders of the lost ark,, watch this!!",9,2,3,9 December 2015
The Simpsons Movie," Good, but not as good as the old TV show
","Now, I am a fan of the old ones. Not the new ones, but the old ones. But when it comes to a film, almost all jokes and plot have to be similar. That's what best describes this movie. The plot can be strong, like how the people are trapped in a dome, but the humor of it all is like your average episode of the Simpsons. The jokes are mostly good, too. The animation is pretty decent-good, and the character design has improved, but it looks too perfect. Now the developed characters probably have to be Bart and Homer, but the rest is either a comedy relief, a family member that's there since its a Simpsons movie (Lisa, Maggie and Marge.) Now Marge does make Homer change his mind, but she's not very developed and sure Lisa is helping the town, but neither is she. The villain, Russ Cargill is kind of threatening, but in a humorous way and he could've been used better.So overall, this is a hit and it's good, but it could've been better. I'd actually like the show to end now that it's stale, but they should make another movie. The story is pretty dumb, but so dumb it's funny. This is probably one of the last Simpson thing that kept the good quality. So if you're a fan, this is the film for you, especially if you're a fan of the new ones.Story: 7/10 Animation: 6.5/10 Characters: 6/10 Overall, 7/10",7,2,11,3 October 2015
The Martian," Nice job Oscars for nominating this!
","Yep, this film is rated just fine. It's like Cast away(2000) combined with the previous space blockbuster Interstellar(2014). But how good is it in my opinion.Like we see in the trailers, Astronout Mark Watney cannot be saved from a storm on Mars as his crew has no choice but to leave. But Mark Watney survives but Earth figures this out and brainstorms how to get him back to Earth. There is no antagonist, but a very simple plot. It's enjoyable most of the time, but one problem with it is that the Earth sub-plot starts out interesting, but becomes a bunch of very boring talk that no one, no one wants to listen to. I was just thinking, move on to Mark Watney. The scenes with Mark Watney are the best scenes in the movie. As Watney would say, 'So yeah, Surprise!'.The special effects are a piece of art. They are just brilliant and they don't over load s much as the Marvel films. There are no flaws. It makes you feel like you are in Mars or NASA. Just incredible.The characters in this film. Mark Watney swears up a storm on Mars (Get it?) and learns to survive on Mars. He is a very smart character, is sometimes funny, and a little inspiring too. The crew that traveled to Mars with Watney are blamed for the problem, but they are not antagonists because they had to leave him for huge safety reasons, but are still great characters. Most of the rest of the characters are helpful, but I should say, bland.So overall, the Martian is a treat and deserves it's Oscar nominations, including best picture of the year. So go watch it. No seriously, I recommend it. Rated PG-13 for language, Frightening scenes, and violence (well, I didn't mean little kids).So overall, the Martian is a true treat",8,1,4,13 February 2016
