Black Swan," White Swan and Black Swan. Good and evil. The second will dominate over the former for the sake of art ...
","Girl Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman), full of promise, a ballerina of the New York ballet. Her life was entirely focused on dancing, and achieving success in their careers. Is largely due to her upbringing. Mama Nina's Eric (Barbara Hershey), a former ballerina, not having achieved recognition, despite all his care, has a negative impact on the girl smothering control and imposing their own ambitions.Plot of the story begins with the moment when the artistic director of Ballet of Nina Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) replaces the prima ballerina Beth McIntyre (Winona Ryder) to open the new season production of 'Swan Lake'.In selecting the lead role, he seeks not a ballerina and actress who will be able to bring on stage two images: white swan and black swan. Heroine Portman, who can not translate the second image due to its internal 'trapped' in a strange way, this gets the role, but as it turned out, Thomas wants by all means unleash its nature, a sexual desire. 'Fuel to the fire,' she adds Lily (Mila Kunis), in which Nina sees the embodiment of that very black swan. Thoughts and close dialogue seems expensive to achieve the goal - to grasp the essence of assigned roles in the forthcoming statement, but is it true? The plot of the fifth feature film by Darren Aronofsky's 'Black Swan' is built on the theme of the possible existence of two sides of personality and rivalry between a man first and foremost with themselves.The only person standing in your way is you. © Judging by the scene, the plot films can certainly blame the film for some of the secondary with respect to the known past films ('All About Eve,' 'Fight Club', 'Lodger', 'Inland Empire') that it would be wrong. 'Black Swan' is a film, a variation on the same topic, but he has an original in its development and serve the audience on the screen. In a picture Aronofsky the dual personality is good suppression before harm, a white swan before the black swan, restricting self-checking before a freedom. Freedom to which so heroine Natali Portman for the sake of convincing game on a scene of theater of ballet aspires, appears for it secret defects destructive and at the same time captivating by realization, desires and own possibilities. Freedom to which the heroine is so eager to Natalie Portman for the sake of convincing the game at the Theatre Ballet, turns to her destructive and at the same time captivating the implementation of secret vices, desires and their own capabilities.Video series of films was made in the style of 'The Wrestler' a, simulating an amateur video of a combination of surreal fantasies of transforming the image of the heroine movie Nina Sayers.This inventive in its storytelling film-horror/triller about ballet keeps in suspense until its strange, creepy and compelling finale. Fans of scary tales and crazy stories are unlikely to remain indifferent.",9,4,10,25 December 2010
Oldboy," Always get pay
","Everything in this life you have to pay - this is the meaning of this film. For everything and even what you may not consider serious or do not understand it or do not even want to understand. Have you ever hurt someone because of his talkative, and if you have it so, then I have sympathy, language, laughing at someone else in order to amuse your self-esteem, spreading a bad rumor about a good man then know that it will take 15 years , 30 years, it does not matter, but you have to pay for your actions. And before you think about revenge, that you may not have such a hero in this story. This neodnaznachnoe (неоднозначное) cinema, art house, but the art just because not everyone will understand and not to each income. Film with strong visuals, music, terrific editing and other technical twists and all at the same time the idea of the meaning of which up to an incredibly profound and relevant as ever. The movie is not about what the world is no good and no bad people, and that every action has a reaction, according to the abstruse Newton's third law. If you compare this movie is only from the film 'A Clockwork Orange by Stanley Kubrick. In Oldboe as a succession of very severe bloody scenes hiding food for thought, food for thought. You should not be afraid of the forms of this product you should get the gist. History is made so that the audience gradually starts to think about all the above things.

Kick-Ass," Blow mind
","Another adaptation of comic books? Oh, how everything has gone crazy for the comics! Cinema occupied unsuited cartoon characters of novels. Some radioactive spider bite, and they are finding a fantastic effect, soar over the heads of ordinary passers-by. Other masters, almost single-handedly, an iron suit and give himself the nickname Iron Man, fighting against terrorism. And, of course, colorful costumes, which, probably, will soon come into vogue. That we have this season is popular? Spring-summer season. Please, give me a wetsuit of Kick-Ass ... What? And the costume is a Black Widow? My wife size there? Hit-girl costume for my daughter ... Save the deal? That's the main character, perhaps the most extraordinary, unusual, shocking, and simply stupid(and maybe still stupid?) Movie in 2010 Dave Lizevski decided to try onthe role of superhero. Only took to the streets with a belligerent look and a fanatical desire to do stupid good as received from some bandits stabbed in the groin. And then it all and the car was hit. Heroic everyday ... oh. Then you know not to save the galaxy, huh.Refer to the 'Kick-ass' very seriously you do not get, but stupid movie just will not name. He is somewhere in the middle between the 'Funny Games,' Haneke and easy 'American Pie'. Picture every now and then goes from one genre to another, confusing the viewer. In «Kick-Ass» will be discussed on the responsibility for his actions, the choice of roles in his life (who you are pathetic red mist or still Kick-ass?), About the destination and want to see that all the terms that I now have listed, never will hear from the mouths of the characters. Do the creators of tape got to balance between comedy and fierce fighter, but not every viewer, even with all the incredible flatness of the film, will be able to perceive the story.The question that defines the film's hero Dave Lizevski moron, 'Can there be a superhero in real life?' In the movie is not the main. There are a lot of moral superhero that somehow almost sacrilegious way sometimes transmitted through toilet humor. In the worst moment of the film, and did make laugh. And can not help but laugh when Matthew Vaughn and his team threw a stone in the garden of American culture? What would have thought Superman before the last moments of my life, do you think? Why did not I started a family? Why do not I build a house? Why am I not planted a tree? Why am I this stupid costume and I like the last idiot circling Empair State Building? Why could not I watch the last series 'Lost'? ..Kick This is not complete. He is controversial, unconventional, then funny, then sad, ultra crazy, ultra violence and sometimes even cute. Kick your brain, let alone a full 'Kick-ass' or not, everyone decides for himself.9 of 10",9,1,4,10 November 2010
The Cabin in the Woods," Familiar and one of my favorite stories.
","When the horror genre has ceased to please the audience with new villains and plots in different time release of the film pays homage to the recognized classics. Walk through the history of such horror. In 1986 came even three of the film 'Fright Night' by Tom Holland, 'Re- Animator' Gordon Stewart and 'Return of the Living Dead' by Dan O'Bannon. In 1986 'Fright Night' won the Saturn as the best horror movie surpassing its competitors. It was filmed as though for fans of Dracula and vampire movies. Complied with all the canons and with a hilarious comedy with cool special effects. 'Re-Animator' was a modern look at the history of 'Frankenstein' and 'The Return of the Living Dead' is the most controversial film of all three continued the story of 'night' and Dawn of the Living Dead 'in a humorous style. 1996 was the year of the movie 'Scream' to use a cliché, 'Halloween' and the most overrated horror film in the history of the 'Friday the 13th.' He was dedicated to all fans of the genre of slasher and turns of the canons of the genre inside out and this has become so popular in his day .. In 1999, the Department released Robert Rodriguez with the story plot of 'Body Snatchers.' In 1998 'The Lost Boys' is also about vampires. In 2010, 'Drag Me to Hell,' with references to 'Zloveyschim dead,' but the film was a curse. By the way director Sam Raimi produced remake of the Japanese 'curse.' It turned out bad.'Cabin in the Woods' pays tribute to the classic 'dead Zloveyschie' Sam Raimi. One of the coolest horror films for innovative photography and special effects. And Bruce Campbell, tough guy. But in fact, in contrast to the 'Scream' Wes Craven's here we see very different techniques. The first 20 minutes of the film is an introduction to the style of 'Zloveyschih dead.' Teens go to the forest to the damn cabin. They are talking. Mention of the map and the road, or rather the fact that there is no road map. Just as in «Evil dead». They come back, start to come off in full, then find the basement, there a book that certainly is cursed. As in the movie Raimi one character out of five said that it is not worth reading, the more so in this book and it is written. Characters receive a warning about the dangers and still read! This is so stupid you say, but you would not have done? It's the same as a teenager in the 80's sitting in a movie theater watching 'Halloween' to say: 'Do not go there, you were waiting for a maniac! Damn well why did you go here! »: Facepalm: In parallel, they are being watched workers underground research center, controlling the situation by pressing any buttons. Their goal to teenagers died and died spectacularly. Yes they are, and they are also an Image. Center employee laughing, discussing everything that makes teenagers and how they are being killed, and those trying to escape. This is an unusual story, this fact has not been anywhere, in any horror movie. All the colorful characters, dialogues through in many ways I'm sure Joss Whedon is very interesting. In his script characters always look like a family - Avengers, Mission Sererniti, Toy Story. It can create an interesting dialogue between them and then he did a great job.After the entry is a different horror movie, nothing to do with 'Zloveyschimi dead.' Lots of blood, there is nudity, good special effects, even though the computer is not much. There is a scene making fun of clichés of the genre of horror. They are not as many as we would like, but they are very clever and most importantly - the end of the movie, you just will not know how it will end until the inspection up to the galleries. This is the first film for the whole year which is really fun to watch. And I was thinking that 'Battleship' in no way inferior to the stupidity of 'Pearl Harbor,' that's all I see this year. Horror genre could again surprise and Joss Whedon to pair with Drew Goddard proved almost as well as Wace Craven 6 years ago.",7,0,1,27 March 2013
