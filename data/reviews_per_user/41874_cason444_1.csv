The Ring," Bucking the trend
","The Ring has finally bucked the trend, started by The Sixth Sense, of trying so hard to have a surprise ending that you write yourself out of a decent story. The great mystery writers of the past never lied to you about which person committed the murder, they convinced you that you didn't need to know who did it until the end of the book, this is the best way that I can explain the way that The Ring redefines the budding modern horror/thriller/mystery genre.I felt that, after The Sixth Sense, M. Night was trying too hard to do something special, and lost sight of filmmaking. This is also true with alot of lesser filmmakers who have tried to make a decent entry into this genre.
The Ring may be a remake, but it is a truly original piece of work, I haven't yet seen Ringu, but boy do I plan on it now!",9,1,1,2 May 2003
