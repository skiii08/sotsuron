Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Way too much
",This movie had a very good concept to it and hearing it made me think it would be great. The only truly funny parts were the people he was talking to: the redneck at the rodeo was obviously ignorant and some of the people(like the one girl at the house) actually showed genuine caring and was probably hurt to see that it was a practical joke on her. The fight scene where they were both naked went way too far and sadly that was representative of this movie. It was a horrible let down and for the few(and right minded) people who dislike jackass do not see this movie. It was just crude and stupid and I pray that there will be no sequel nor any future talk of the movie,3,14,29,20 November 2006
