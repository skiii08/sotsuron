Hereditary," Not a horror movie
",I think the mixed reviews for this movie is due to the fact that the movie was promoted as a horror movie when it wasn't. If you take the 'horror expectations' out of the context then the movie was surprisingly good. I would say have no horror expectations and just sit back and enjoy the ride. It will definitely take you through some twists and turns.,6,1,2,20 June 2018
