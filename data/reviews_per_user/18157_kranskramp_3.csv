Alien 3," I did like it, but there are some things that could have been better
","Seeing the movie when it came out, i did already appreciate the different style and setting in the alien series.
The thought of having to fight the alien without weapons, and in an environment where the people could be your enemy too, was very interesting to me.
Very original indeed.Now it sure was a change from Alien and Aliens, but if they had made a movie in the same style as any of those two movies, it would not have been cool i think.What i did not like though was the fact that a lot of the prisoners in the movie were portrayed as quite daft/ dumb.All in all i think it is definitely worth a 7. If they had made a bit more interesting characters in the movie, this could have been an 8 or even a 9 in my opinion.The acting of the main actors was credible for me.",7,2,2,17 July 2018
Star Trek," Not bad, but no star trek.
","The concept of star trek kinda died with this movie. Maybe the US public likes a testosterone movie like this, but i sure don't.The scene where young Kirk drives a convertible of a cliff, just managing to save himself is just sad. This is just one example of where it went wrong. The actor playing Kirk does his job well though, no discredit to him.Im no Trekkie, but i have seen most (if not all) of the star trek series and movies, i love the concept very very much.Fun movie if you have time to kill, but they should have given it another name like 'space conflict' or whatever simple.Im sorry, this movie was only nice on the part of acting, effects and some other things, but the plot was not great.Don't spend your money on an expensive cinema ticket, buy it on discount (5 bucks max) one day and you will notice.",5,1,3,4 October 2009
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Entertaining movie, would recommend
","Very entertaining movie to me. I wasn't in the right mood to watch a movie. I generally do not have the patience to sit a movie through, but this one went down easy.I like sci-fi and i can handle fantasy in some cases. The movie itself may not have been a classic, but i found cast and acting very interesting. Lots of famous actors, but also a couple of new to me.The effects are incredible, something that would fit a movie like this. Now i said earlier i can handle fantasy in some cases. GoG2 does have a few 'over the top' graphic sides to it, but hey that's me. I found some scenes a bit too 'dreamlike', if that makes sense, the shiny blurriness was all over the place at times.The story was easy to follow and to see through, that is a bit of a letdown for me. I would like to be a bit challenged, although i do admit that is hard nowadays in movies.Overall i found it to be interesting and entertaining, keeping my attention the whole time. Oh, this is the first Guardians of the galaxy movie i see and i didn't know it was from Marvel.",7,12,19,15 August 2017
