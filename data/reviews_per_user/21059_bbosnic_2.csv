Blade Runner 2049," Boring and unworthy
","I watched the original Blade Runner (all versions) like 50 times. It is one of my favorite all time movies. This sequel is a bad attempt to create the same noir atmosphere and magic of the old one. Boring long scenes, undeveloped characters and meaningless dialogues are overabundant and I almost fell asleep three times in the cinema. And Harrison Ford's role is a joke. It is clear that this movie was made to make money off of the glory of the original. Similar to what has happened to Star Wars and the Ghost In The Shell. There is just no soul in it, no higher meaning, no Zen. Those three short intro stories were 10 times better than this movie. Shame on you, Ridley Scott, for allowing this piece of crap tarnish your masterpiece and your legacy.",3,27,59,7 October 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," Entertaining
","Not a bad way to spend 2h to get your mind off of everyday things. It's full of colors and beautiful CIGs. And that's about it. But it is entertaining. It is closer to a comedy infused movie like the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' than it is to the first Thor movie witch I really liked. And while the movie made me smile a few times, I can't help but thinking: is this what the viewers want these days? To see distant, magical worlds on the screen, and magical, eternal, godlike beings acting and making jokes like in some sitcom like 'Will & Grace' and 'Friends'? If the answer is 'yes' then you will enjoy this movie.",5,20,52,28 October 2017
