The Ring," Ringu is better
",I saw ringu a while ago and wanted for a while to see this to compare. I watched this today and whereas ringu was the scariest film I've ever seen this wasn't by a mile. Sadako is much much scarier than Samara for a start. Ringu just has a scarier aura whereas this is just like any old american horror film... ie: not very scary at all. My advice is see ringu. It is much better in every way and especially 'the scene' (as I have heard it referred to. You'll know what I mean when you see it (well if you see ringu because the ring's version of it is lame in comparison)). If this was original it would be OK but it's not so just watch the original.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Utter rubbish
","This film was to put it simply rubbish. The child actors couldn't act, as can be seen by Harry's supposed surprise on learning he's a wizard. 'I'm a wizard!' is said with such indifference you'd think he's not surprised at all. I've never read the books and this film did nothing to make me want to read them. The only spell this cast over me was one to get me out of the room as quickly as possible every time I have seen this on after my first viewing of it in the cinema. If you want to see a decent book made film watch Lord of the Rings or possibly the sequel to this which I thought was actually good. 1/10",1,25,69,29 November 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Much better than the first
","I am one of those dying breed of people who haven't ever picked up a Harry Potter book with the slightest intention of reading it. However, I saw the first film and thought it was a load of rubbish. However, I am not commenting on that here. This film was much better. Not only did I find the story better, but the special effects were very good and they could actually act in this one. I enjoyed this film a lot and that is much better than the first which I sat through in the cinema only to walk out of it every other time I've seen it. 8/10",5,0,1,29 November 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Brilliant doesn't begin to describe it
","What can I say? This is the most wonderful film ever made. Tolkien's story cannot be better of course, but the way Jackson presents it is so spectacular that it was beyond all expectations. I consider myself very lucky going to see it on the day it opened here in England and am going to go again on Sunday. See it.",10,1,1,17 December 2003
