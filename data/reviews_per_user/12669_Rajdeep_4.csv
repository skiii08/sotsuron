Vertigo," Overhyped.
","If you are a Hitchcock fan (or wish to be one!) watch 'North by Northwest'. If you a James Stewart fan, you could watch 'It's a wonderful life'. If you like both, then do watch 'Rear window'. But 'Vertigo' can be safely given the miss without ever having a reason to regret it. For what it delivers, it's forty-five minutes too long, lacks the technical finesse of some of Hitchcock's later films ('North ...', 'The Birds', 'Psycho'), and is completely unconvincing (and often contrived).Of course, Kim Novak looks smashing! But then, we all have our virtues.",5,5,15,7 October 1999
Chinatown," multi-layered complexity - eternal appeal
","There is always more to 'Chinatown' than meets the eye on the first viewing. Like the proverbial onion, one discovers more and more as one peels the outer layers.Jack Nicholson was first-rate as a private eye, and Dunaway provided sufficient support for the acting to be termed 'memorable'. That is till you consider John Huston. He was absolutely magnificent in his portrayal of a crooked father. And with Polanski directing the film with his usual aplomb, it comes up real trumps.The story is quite complex, but you never get the feeling that someone has gone over the board, as you often do with some of the other films of its genre. The tragic ending is chilling, and leaves you feeling vaguely bitter about our world. Nicholson's character makes you feel sad, but you never pity him. You might dislike Evelyn, but will never despise her.Overall great cinema - timeless in its appeal (even if you miss the director's brief appearance as a toughie in a superbly shot scene). 9/10.",10,2,3,7 October 1999
Catch-22," Disappointing!
","For fans of Joseph Heller's brilliant satire on war, Mike Nichols' effort was disappointing. A lot of the most interesting (and funny) parts were left out (including the absolutely hilarious court-martial of Yossarian) and most of the characters were not allowed to develop to their full potential. Major Major Major Major was a let-down, as was the exclusion of Nurse Duckett. Colonel Cathcart's character (pardon the alliteration) had much more meat in the book, and where was that sequence of the Washington Irving letters? Alan Arkin managed to look believable as the only sane man in a crazy world, and kudos to him.Probably it would have been a better idea to forget creative licenses and stick to the chronological order of events as in the book. Although one must grant that maybe it's not the easiest of books to film, just as it is not the easiest of books to follow, as its readers will vouch.",5,4,8,8 October 1999
Apocalypse Now," magic realism on cinema!
","Francis Ford Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now' is a brilliant piece of poetry on celluloid that depicts the utter insanity of war. Often revolting, sometimes rambling, frequently luxuriantly beautiful, at times poetic, this film portrays the horrors of war like no other film in living memory has. With liberal sprinkling of literary allusions, poetry, classical music and haunting rock-n-roll, the film is, without a shade of doubt, a sublime creation by a master of his craft.I have read multiple reviews which harp on the fact that the film is historically inaccurate, that Coppola was not sure of the ending, and that it is devoid of any one special idea. It is possible that this is so, but surely any attempt at depicting lunacy must necessarily deviate from the normal. The artist is entitled to the liberty of using all possible means - although apparently meaningless to others - to achieve his end. Towards that end, it is clear, even to the casual observer, that this is an intensely personal film that mirrors some of the beliefs and convictions of the film-maker. Coppola could not have made this film sitting in a Hollywod studio - he must have spilled his blood and guts out on location.Viewers looking to find Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' in the film might be disappointed, and not without reason. The film is only loosely based on that story, and the director has modified the novel to suit his storyline. But that does not take away anything from the languid beauty of the film. As you follow Willard down the river, and witness one act of insanity after another, you realise that for realistic portrayal of horror, this film is an unparalleled achievement. Using the magnificent locales to its advantage (embellished with haunting cinematography - sometimes surreal, sometimes terrifying) this film best incorporates some of the elements of magic realism (as inspired by the works of Freud, Joyce, Dali and Garcia-Marquez).To expect the same attributes in this film as those which make up some of the other so-called classics, and therefore to use the same established set of parameters to judge it would be a folly. Like all art, it too is often inscrutable and ambiguous, sometimes dubious, and almost always open to interpretations. But sometimes, even life is like that.",8,0,0,28 October 1999
