Blade Runner 2049," Almost a masterpiece
","Overall this was an exceptional movie. And it exceeded my expectations for it in some ways but fell short in other ways.In terms of visual style, I have to say I was stunned by the beauty of the environments and the closeness to the original. Visually this is one of the best movies I have ever seen and it truly felt like a Blade Runner movie. I was amazed with what I was seeing on screen.The acting was also excellent all around. I felt like they created characters and gave us the chance to get to know them and the actors did a great job portraying the experience of their characters.The fight scenes were superbly done. I loved how they contrasted the fighting with the normal progression of the movie, it gave everything a nice effect and really helped illustrate the nature of the replicants and how they operate.The only things that I really want to criticize are the plot and the audio. The sounds in this were amazing but they felt out of sync with what was happening on screen at times. Otherwise the sound was great and really enhanced the experience.The plot was a little too light hearted for me. It has a typical Hollywood fluff ending which wasn't befitting of the nightmare that is unfolding before our eyes in this film. And this film is absolutely a nightmare.I hope that if they make another one they go less with a plot and more into the psychology of the world they live in and the fear and loneliness that surround the idea of being alive.",8,2,16,8 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Went to s***
","Are there any artists left or is it all just committees and focus groups that drive everything now? It's plain to me that America's day in the sun as the leader in mass media is over. A society too overburdened with the idea of making money at all costs can't be a leader in creativity. And all the new generation cares about is texting each other 10,000 variations of the smiley emoji. They don't give a s*** about or even understand art. It's a new kind of society from the one I grew up in, instead of personal expression it's personal suppression. Suppression in the form of incessant buzzing technology demanding that we all look, think, act, speak, and dress alike. Watching this movie warp itself into a harry potter-esque monstrosity it becomes obvious that creativity is dying if it isn't dead yet. And toleration for things that are different is at an all time low.... Now I realize it is time for Star Wars to end. It wasn't meant to go on this long. The truth is, there was one good Star Wars movie, and it really was good. Everything after that has just been an excuse to profit off the thing that worked. Not art, just profit. Apparently my generation can't come up with it's own stories to tell the world, we're content just rehashing tired old crap for a new generation of imbeciles. Cei la vie, thats life, the end.",2,1,10,21 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A very, very, very good homage to the originals
","I enjoyed this movie overall. It feels like a Star Wars movie, they succeeded in that. And for succeeding in that I have to say THANK YOU. In many ways it's more of a Star Wars movie than the originals. This might be the weird, corny, action-packed movie that George Lucas intended to make the first time. I'll never know how the original came to be what it was, whether through accident or intent, it was unique. Uniquely imaginative, awesome, and sometimes just funny, but it really meant something to me. It is a world where magic is real, and people can be truly special, and their lives can be truly meaningful, and the fate of a whole galaxy can rest in the hands of a small band of those magical people. This movie sets up a new cast of special characters, unlikely heroes, and a couple old friends, and it does it, very, very well. The end result is something that only a curmudgeon could find fault with, this film oozes quality, it feels like everyone involved gets it and runs with it. And run they do, from beginning to end this film is filled with FX and action. It's not perfect, but few things are. It's certainly made with care and consideration of the source material, and I appreciate that. Minus a couple unfortunate script ideas here and there it's a solid movie in all respects. Probably JJ Abrams best movie.",8,3,28,18 December 2015
