The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," tasteless film experience
","The first two instalments were nice to watch and made me curious about the sequel. They totally lost me with this one. I have to add that I did not read the books.The film is very boring and stupid. The characters are becoming boring and shallow. The pace in the film is none. The only action is revealed and actually seen in the official trailer.The characters are totally ruined and Katniss in spite of her previous acts of sacrifice, becomes very selfish, ready to let the whole nation bleed for her own feeling of satisfaction. The new characters are not properly developed and some old ones have rather random appearance, making the plot a set of mostly random and unimportant acts and moments.The young adult previously fighting for her life (and the lives of others) and prepared to kill now becomes a teenager totally lost in her little sorrows and feelings. Again and again and again until the film is over.I had some expectation after the first two instalments and this felt like a let-down.",3,5,6,28 February 2015
The Expendables 2," it can't get much better than this!
","I give 9/10, cause I need to have something in my sleeve should there be Ex3 ;-) Ex1 wasn't bad, but this is so much better. Don't remember any movie recently that left me in such a good mood.The film is all I would expect from a run'n'shoot action genre. And yes, there is an exact line between good and bad like in the the old fairy tales.The dialogues are funny and the actors are not afraid to make fun of themselves and their previous roles. In a way, they actually play a parody to themselves. This is most unusual and refreshing and extend the characters behind the plot of the film. In addition, the film did surprised me pleasantly a few times (not with the plot) and that does not happen that often anymore.There are references to older films, public life /gossip and even jokes. Back than, when Rambo and Commando came out, Stallone and Schwarzenegger wasn't really a couple in love and many of the phrases would be a clich√© if they would be said by somebody else. Lucky for us - they are not.The plot in this genre is not very complicated. If you expect a Sherlock Holmes or Da Vinci Code movie, don't watch it. The plot was clear long before they even decided to make it. If this disappoints you, than this genre is probably not your cap of tea.The atmosphere starts immediately and gets graduated. But if you lucky, you should find a 30 second window between actions, long enough to get you another beer from the fridge.If you want some action and fun this is a yes. And if you remember the 80', you will have more fun than action and the film is full of action.",9,0,0,5 November 2012
Pacific Rim," fisting your mind
","This film is very simple minded. Don't expect anything and you will not be disappointed. Unless you paid for tickets, in which case it might be a bit of a let down.Shame is that it is becoming a new film genre - huge budget, a lot of cgi with no story, no tension and poor actor performance. and sometimes it would be better off as a silent movie too.I will not add anything from the plot, but I am sure you will know the what will happen at least one minute in advance. The biggest mystery is the score here at IMDb. It is watchable, but it's a typical watch & bin it movie.",2,2,6,12 October 2013
Taken," is this how it works?
","Please tell me what you think of the script: (Warning this is a SPOILER :-)Natasha, a spoiled daughter of Igor (an ex KGB spy) goes to New York with a girl-friend. While Natasha is on the phone with her father, they get kidnapped from their apartment. Igor, knowing that time is of the essence, does not call the local police (who would trust the NYPD while he is only 10000 miles away) and decides to fly over for a visit.Igor breaks into the apartment. He knows that the Mexican Mafia is involved and kills a man at the airport and so the killing begins.To give it the right atmosphere, Igor speaks only Russian, as he knows that all Americans speak fluently Russian, especially the Mexican Mafia members.Igor meets his old friend John, who used to work in CIA and is now a NYPD head officer, who tells him he can't help him, but gives him a business card. Using this business card Igor pretends to be a special NYPD officer while he speaks only Russian. The Mexican Mafia members believe Igor and he successfully infiltrates their established HQ and kills everyone in his way. The NYPD does not care much for murder and violence Igor leaves behind, as this is widely accepted in New York.He deliberately cripples his friend, an innocent mother of children, by shooting her with a gun, because she was married to John.He kills the big boss, rescues his daughter and leaves the country via JFK Airport, cause the Mafia, NYPD, CIA and Customs administration are absolutely useless. When he comes home, his ex wife gets his 'I was right message' and everyone in Russia is happy.So what do you think of the script? How plausible is it? Well, to give a connection to the film Taken, try to substitute: Natasha=Kim, Igor=Bryan, NY=Paris, Russian=English, Mexican=Albanian, KGB=CIA etc.Maybe if the film wouldn't try to be so serious but had been more like From Paris with love or Pulp Fiction the script would be much more appropriate.",3,3,6,4 November 2012
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Did I miss the point?
","I was probably expecting something other. English is not my native language and I do not have much of a connection to Broadway or its history, so I would most likely miss much of the interpretation in translation, but I found the movie extremely boring.I like that the film was made without visible cuts, as this was a new experience. I don't think I would like others to follow, since the camera moves were sometimes distracting, but it's nice for a change. And it definitely suits a film about theater.Otherwise the movie pace was terribly slow for me. I actually could not watch it in one go. Only after a few week, I felt like finishing the other half, which was not much better as the first and I was forwarding most of the last 20min.This film is not to my taste and I cannot recommend watching it. The plot pace was like the drum music in it - without climax, just dragging on forever.",2,15,32,28 February 2015
Prometheus," Prometheus - the good and bad things and the biggest mystery
","So what's bad and good about Prometheus? The bad first - the script seems to be a huge line of holes with a little plot in between. It might not even be written with words, but rather sketched as a comic book and the dialogues and actions are the direct result of an immediate improvisation of the actors trying to get from one scene to another.The characters behave irrationally, professionals act as pure stupid amateurs. The whole team is acting (and looks like) as a bunch of junkies when exploring a junk-yard. Luckily there are no safety procedures and protocols on the ship, so the misery wont take long.Ridley Sotts' science consultant has just finished the first grade school. But that's just fine, because the anatomy consultant must be a pre-school, cause his knowledge is based on first 'How was I born' answer = You were in mama's belly and the doctors opened it gently and took you out. The ship was designed with the imagination of a 16 years old, as it is cool to include a snooker room, a lot of alcohol and a huge gym where the android can play basketball and ride his bike. In the end it's called a space ship for a reason - cause it has a lot of space in it! The android, however, is very limited and his input-output interfaces are the eyes, ears and mouth. To wrap it up, from the moment you meet the crew in its full beauty, you're only waiting for the members to die. The only fun is to guess the order (I am sure you know who the first will be the moment you see him). Since they are junkies pretending to be scientist you feel like they deserve it and you shall not miss any of them. (Some should have chocked already in the cryo-sleep anyway).Now the good things about the film. Some scenes are really nice - for example the first 30sec - but are these even related to the rest of the movie? But the best moment was when I read some of the critic reviews with spoilers, I nearly wet my pants.The big mystery of the film - how on earth can it have 7.3? Either the audience 'chose they want to believe' or Hollywood has paid 1 Trillion to create 150,000 IMDb accounts and voted 10!I would hesitate to recommend this film unless you can watch it for free and love special effects (and even so you will waste your time).",2,2,4,3 November 2012
Black Panther," boring movie
","I try to keep it simple. This is one of the the worst hero movies. Boring with chaotic action parts and outside of action the movie has a pace of a dead horse.There is no action, there is chaos. That a spear is not good choice again a gun knows everybody. To make up for this 'handicap', the fighting scenes are cut every 2 second resulting in a chaotic mishmash. This is in strong contrast to the rest of the peace less movie.This is and should have remained a purely fictional hero movie, but the attempt to put it into context with painful events in the history of Africa is the biggest laugh to the misery and suffering of its people.The feeling after the movie is clear: disappointment.",2,8,13,24 May 2018
