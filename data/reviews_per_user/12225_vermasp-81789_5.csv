Airlift," Proud to be an Indian--- by Maharishi Verma
","Now, I'm not going to tell you about the mistakes of this movie I'm going to tell you that what I liked in this movie.There is no need to discuss the plot because that is well-known.first thing which I like in this film is performances of actors , every actors in lead or supporting role have tried their best.Akshay Kumar has delivered a soul-full performance. He goes into the depth of his character and what we get is the best performance of Akshay's career.Nimrat also does her best .The other supporting cast including Purab Kohli does justice to their roles.Raja Menon ,the director, has successfully evolved the human drama in this war- thriller.But there is another plus point which is the songs which are brilliantly written.The cinematography is awesome and same for the VFXs.This is a movie which will be remembered as a classic, for its effort ,especially for AKSHAY KUMAR.",9,1,2,16 May 2016
Man of Steel," Man of Steel-- Confusing screenplay,Poor casting ---by Maharishi Verma
","I must say that Superman Returns (2006) was a far better film than this.Henry Cavill is the most boring Superman, yet with zero facial expressions.The movie wastes much of its time in establishing the characters.It examines the viewer's patience as Superman takes lot of time to come on screen.Cavill looks tired on screen, Amy Adam looks aged,Like she has been mistakenly cast.Zack Snyder's direction is functional,One would expect more from him after Watchmen(2009) and 300 (2007).Sorry Mr.Snyder but this time not justified.The problem of the film lies in its screenplay,which is confusing.Rather than entertaining,It tries to spoon-feed every detail about the story.All in all Man of Steel is not what you are expecting.My RATING--*1/2 out of 5",4,2,3,13 June 2016
Kick-Ass," Don't dare to miss it-- Kick Ass-- reviewed by Maharishi Verma.
","Plot-- Dave an unnoticed teenager decided to become a vigilante by taking inspiration from comic books.But, soon he realizes it's not so easy as he thinks.Meanwhile , here is another super hero(without superpowers) named Big Daddy who is also fighting with criminals with her daughter Mindy. Performances--- The entire lead cast include Aaron Taylor Johnson, Nicolas Cage, Chloe Grace Moretz and Christopher Mintez had delivered good performances.Aaron Taylor's witty jokes make viewers laugh.Nicolas Cage and Chloe Moretz had provided a good support.where Christopher Mintez has been perfectly cast as a confused kid. Whatever, the action scenes leaves much to be desire.Editing is so crisp which do not let the viewer's interest down. The cinematography is good as the screen filled with colorful characters. All in all it's an good action comedy so, don't miss it otherwise, I' ll kick your............understand!",7,0,0,30 April 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," OMG!The worst superhero film I'd ever seen.---by Maharishi Verma
","There is only one word to describe this flick,which is 'Trash'.The poorly written screenplay,the acting,and boring action sequences everything is just rubbish.After the forgettable 'Man of Steel' Zack Snyder,Once again, succeeded in his mission of boring the viewers. As I mentioned above the script is too weak to hold the viewer's interest as the previous installments this one takes more time in establishing the characters.Henry Cavill disappoints.Ben Affleck does his job well.Other actors does what they got.Action scenes are heavily stuffed. Like MofS this one is highly depends on VFX rather than script.When I saw the trailer I was very excited but after watching this, I need to go to a doctor.My rating---*/5.",3,5,9,13 June 2016
