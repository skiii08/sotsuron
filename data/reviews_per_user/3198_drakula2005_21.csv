Sucker Punch," Zack Snyder's cruelty once again finds it's audience
","Listening to Emily Browning's adaptation of Eurythmics's Sweet Dreams, i must say i found some decisions in the movie-making process very bizarre, decisions made mainly by Zack Snyder, coming right out of the blue.For example, he wrote the script directly as a PG-13 movie, something very untypical for him.In an interview, he stated, that the movie was already to cruel and the story itself was too hard on viewers for him to make it an R-rated movie.So he did it directly for PG-13.When does that ever stopped him to do it.In Watchmen, there were some pretty intense and gross, so to say, scenes, that it was hard to bear.And in Sucker Punch, the opening scene was intense, full of emotions, so was the ending as well, but that's not a reason for Zack no to do what he's best at.So that was a sucker punch for the audience, and as well a reason for the movie not to fit in to the frame of most Zack Snyder movies.Even his remake of Romero's Dawn of the Dead was performing better at the domestic box office in it's start, not to mention Watchmen and 300.Besides that, there are some plot holes to be seen here or there, acting to be improved and some other details, that need to be touched to be perfect.So saying all that, i shall explain why i'll rather give the movie the full note than apply those weaknesses to the note.Zack Snyder has those skills, i personally think no other director has.He has the ability to speak to the audience with his style with what we see on screen, combined with the powerful soundtracks and songs he and Tyler Bates, the composer, use.He lets his visually rich and upgraded style speak for himself, and that's very unique for him and for the movies he make.There literary is no dialogue in the first few minutes of the movie, he allows the viewer to see and be a part of the experience, of those frames.The feeling in the viewer is stronger when it's all shown, rather than spoken of.Actions are stronger than words.And Zack Snyder knows that.With him words are not necessary for the strenght of a movie.And that he makes perfect good use of.That's what's impressive with his work, and that's why i'll give the full note to the movie, as i did to 300 and Watchmen despite some flaws and holes.Otherwise, the CGI was great, the movie as a whole is a visual masterpiece and people will see that a lot of effort and commitment is sacrificed for the quality, the movie has.The crystal clear shots, made a little 60s like, are great and the fight sequences and than the train and castle sequences in the imaginary world, that Babydoll's in are great.So there can't be any complaints about that.The acting was something that could've been up a little bit.Emily Browning is very lovable and convincing in her role as Babydoll, a young girl, who experienced the death of her mother and sister, and her stepfather, involved in it.He institutionalizes her and she reprises this part of her role almost perfect.She has the needed experience from her last movie, The Uninvited, where the role is very similar to this one, at least most of it.Shid did a perfect job with the other part of her role as well, being a somewhat silent but very skillful and good looking deadly warrior, killing everything in her way to survive in the imaginary world she creates, in the brothel and in the mental institution she's at.Abbie Cornish was also solid in her role as one of the girls in the facility.Vera Gorski and Blue Jones, played by Carla Gugino and Oscar Isaac were good as well, although his role is very unpleasant so to say.So the acting was good and it's obvious, that the cast had a great time together.That's mainly because of another great choice Zack Snyder and Tyler Bates've made.They let Emily Browning, who, aside from her acting skills, is obviously a talented singer as well, perform some of the songs, for example Sweet Dreams and Asleep, both of witch were reprised and remade perfectly for the film.The voices of the other actresses can be heard in the background of the songs.So that made a great bond between the actors and what helped to improve the movie.So with some great decisions from the team and some great performances from the cast (mainly Emily Browning pulling the movie forward), the movie ended up as a very entertaining movie-going experience, sad and intense at moments, breathtaking and cool in others.All in all, it could've been better but i liked it like that as well and in order to get some things straight, i'm ready to see it once more.I liked it, one of the first movies a really liked this year, and although this wasn't Zack Snyder's best effort financially, the movie definitely has it's fans, and so it marks the true beginning of the movie season.Not Zack Snyder's best, but i'll give it the full note anyway.Bring on Superman:Man of Steel!10/10 P.S.There are tributes to some classics in the movie, classics such as LOTR, i'm sure you'll notice them :)",10,90,179,10 April 2011
Resident Evil: Afterlife," 'Afterlife' is great-Milla's return to the role, that fits her the most!
","I saw Resident Evil when it got out back in 2002, and was impressed by the tension and action and, by Milla Jovovich, of course.Although flawed, the second installment of the franchise found more room to expand to than i could've ever imagined.And though it was logical, the third one provided the goods as well with more action and a bigger picture, as well.Now, visiting a pre-screening of 'a movie', everything would've been perfect, if the movie was one of Zack Snyder's upcoming efforts, or Milla/Anderson's new Resident Evil.And boy, was i happy to know it was one of my most anticipated movies this year.Now, Alice is back, once again.I wasn't sure what to expect, because the series were strong and solid so far, but it isn't easy to keep up the good pace.So, at first, i thought it wasn't going to be easy to match the prequels, especially the scale of the last installment.But then, the news about the 3D came around, and followed by the fusion system technology announcement, the infamous Cameron creation, that will be used almost ruthlessly often in the future, it was all clear.I saw it getting better and better, the development of the movie was incredible lately and, though the trailer wasn't saying much, i was kind of hoping to cover the best parts, and i luckily hoped right and this was the best part-i wasn't expecting even half of the action and battle sequences i saw.And i must say, that the cast is the best, that could've been assembled.Ali Larter is great, she's grown so much to the series, that fits her perfectly well.Wenthwort Miller is cool, a little bit Scofield-like, but that's normal.After all, he was great as a con.The only thing i missed was Oded Fehr, who has portrayed a very likable and convincing character in the 2-nd and 3-rd installments.And, surprisingly, the script had more incommon with the videogames than the prequels had.I mean, that's a fresh take, and the 3D makes it better.This is probably the best 3D since How to Train Your Dragon was around, and as a horror/action movie-the best of it's kind.Just to compare, the technology was way better than the 3D, used in the last 'Destination' installment and, as well, better then 'Valentine's Day' remake.And those movies made a lot of profits at the Box Office.And to add something up-i red a review, claiming that the movie is a 'Matrix' rip-off.So my advice is this-don't listen to those claims-first of all, there were some stunts, looking very similar to a couple, featured in 'The Matrix', but the script led very logically to them, and this isn't a trademark for 'The Matrix'.People dodging bullets or walking on walls-wow i've seen this somewhere else-oh yes, in, at least 2 or 3 movies.Second of all, those scenes are very sane and surely not even looking close to those, in the Wachovski movie, instead being shot in an entirely different style.It's like claiming that a car, plane or train explosion is a trademark for some movie.And those people should admit, that The Matrix is also copying a couple of movies.And those movies are Alex Proyas's 'Dark City' and Germany's 'Welt am Draht'.So don't give the audience false infos.Another interesting thing was the way Anderson shot the movie-in entirely different style from the previous ones.This new moves are definitely a change in direction for Anderson as a director, a fresh and surely an epic one.So expect 'Afterlife' to surpass the domestic achievements of its predecessors, because, aside from the fusion tech and the hype surrounding it's release, the movie has something the above-mentioned movies don't-a convincing lead.Because Milla Jovovich sets the mark for lead female characters in all movies to come, and she's fantastic-Alice's return and the role that fits Milla Jovovich the most.Fantastic movie for fans, a real peak in it's genre.And one of the best movies of its kind this year.My rate:A deserved 10/10 for Milla & co.",10,152,310,2 September 2010
Iron Man 2," And that's coming from a neutral viewer:Iron Man's astonishing return!
","At first, when a heard about a second installment, i thought, i was unsure in it, because Jon Favreau is relatively new on the director's chair, so could he pull of another classic superhero movie?The answer is simple-YES! I saw it in its opening day and the theatre was full.I went along with a few friends, and all of them loved it!Here are some things, we all agreed we liked.CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:It was pretty good in this movie-making aspect, although it is an action movie, there is some quite exciting development, especially the leads.Don Cheadle made a perfect substitute of Terrence Howard, and looked pretty good in the movie.So did the Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlet Johansson's heroines.For me, Scarlet is one of the most gifted and talented and in the same time, the most beautiful actresses in the last decade and even more.And last, but not least, of course, the Iron Robert Downey Jr., making one of his unique, specifically for him, roles.He is smart, funny and in the same time, well, action hero type of guy-he adds so much to this otherwise, stereotyped role.Sam Rockwell was a little irritating, but that's what his role is supposed to be, and to those who have doubts, yes, Mickey Rourke made a decent and interesting role again.TIMING:Almost perfect, except, maybe, the opening credits and a few over timed scenes afterwards, everything was alright and on the perfect spot.PLOT/STORY:I finally can say it-YES, the day has come.A day, where superhero movies haven't got just CGI, put a pretty decent story, attached to the normal amount of CGI.Well, hard to say normal, a little bit over-the-top, but nonetheless fun, when you get use to the headache.The humor was perfect, brilliantly touched to the smallest line.And most importantly-it's not that predictable-i don't mean the ending, but the development, leading to it.Excecutet skilfully, when looked from this point of view.CGI:10/10, nothing else to add.Believable Flawless.Perfect.With no big flaws or plot holes, very funny dialogue, skillful acting and good directing, Iron Man is definitely the best movie of the year so far.The perfect blockbuster as well.I'm glad a saw it, and if the first one didn't made me a fan, this one did.I can't wait to see it again.Cheers to Iron Man Amazing! I would've given this a ten, but with some very few weaknesses, i'll lower this a little, although it did make me a bigger fan than before...My rate: 7.5/10",7,34,64,30 April 2010
Argo," Over-hyped
","This review may be coming a little bit late, considering i saw the movie back in November, but i wanted to check one or two things before i write it.I wanted to see whether or not the movie will receive any Academy awards buzz from the the Golden Globes and the various Guild awards.I wanted to wait, because i could not believe the hype surrounding it.I saw it, and i was not that impressed at all.So after some amount of time has passed and the seven Academy nominations have been announced, i thought it was time for a second viewing, in order to try and change my mind about the movie, but-no.First of all, i enjoyed Gone Baby Gone and The Town of Affleck's repertoire much more than i did with Argo.I would even recommend Zero Dark Thirty (Bigelow's recent take on historical events, that are important to American society)ahead of Argo.That being said, Affleck's based-on-true-story-sci-fi-flick has it's strenghts.The fact that the movie is solid enough and that a thorough enough background-check on the events depicted in it, are made, admittedly do the movie some justice.It's well and accurately written, but a nomination is as far as it can stretch itself.Never mind the fact that Affleck is still weaker in front of the camera, than he is behind it, this is clearly visible.One might even wonder how he has that experience as an actor and as a director and be so far ahead with the material when at the helm of a movie.So, the era is accurately depicted, even the jokes, sets, clothing, music-all fits the bill, although Led Zeppelin's When the Levee Breaks is probably 10-12 years earlier, thus not from this period.But i'm willing to close my eyes on this one, considering the love i have towards Plant&co.On that subject, Aerosmith and Dream On were more accurately chosen, although only for the trailer.The technical part of the movie was almost excellent, i mean there isn't any breakout aspect to put in the running for some awards (although some people obviously think there is), all in all everything was good enough.Maybe only William Goldenberg can get a nod over the others, but he'll have stiff competition from his other movie, Zero Dark Thirty and himself.As this is pretty evident by now, he has two nominations in one category for two different movies.So, it will be pretty interesting to see which movie do the critics hold in higher regard-this category will tell.For me, that should be 'Zero'.So, technically good, historically accurate, even a little tense, so what's the matter, you might ask.Very simple.Contrary to popular belief, that has been planted in most people's minds, there actually was no acting in this movie.Not a single part was properly played by nobody, including you, Mr. Arkin.I can't understand where did this nomination come from, but in my eyes it is totally undeserved.Arkin and Goodman were of course fine, fun to watch, but the parts they played, others have played so long ago and to a better extend.When we start off with Sunset Blvd. and stop at present-day Hank Moody, there are people much more prepared to the challenges of playing a movie guy.Arkin was fine, but for 10 minutes of screen time you just can't receive that kind of reception and you just can't make this big of an impact.It is not normal.Not that they are, those awards and guild-members.So, if i have to sum it up in a nutshell-the screenplay was good enough, the directing was decent as well, the acting was stiff at best (i'm looking at you, Ben), the era was pretty impressively(although inaccurately story-wise) depicted (still looking at you, Ben), the technical part was top-notch (William Goldberg), but all in all this does not make up for the 'masterpiece' many of you claimed it to be.If i had to recommend it, i would, simply because of it's must-see- based-on-true-story(although if we have to go there, discussing how accurate it really is, we'd be in for a long night) factor.But, as i said earlier, i'm not that impressed and there is nothing all that much to be impressed with.And Best Picture?No way!!My rate: 6.5/10",7,121,239,16 January 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Cooler in every Aspect
","As a non Star Trek fan, i might say i found the film staying as far as possible from that universe, without spoiling all the joy to the followers.J.J. Abrams has a way of doing this and i'm sure he'll do it again with Star Wars, although it is a little strange for one person to be doing probably the most iconic sci-fi movies for two of the most devoted fractions of fan groups, despite the fact they don't like each other-the hardcore fans especially-not one bit.So, on with the film-i must confess i found the first film to be nothing special.Yes, some special effects thrown into it were indeed, spectacular, but the story itself was quite linear and straightforward.No intensity, no tension, only technicalities and quite the strange unit to be honest.It definitely had more for the fans, since it was basically an origins story, and that bugged me as well, because all i wanted was action, clever twists, some wit in the mix, and last, but not least-a great villain (which, albeit an A-lister, Eric Bana sadly isn't).But for god's sake-Benedict Cumberbatch is!The story was quite interesting, more than the first time for sure, some clever writing was involved and finally we get to see Kirk (Pine) and Spock (Quinto) actually act, you know-with real emotions and tears in their eyes.This time the action was more and even more impressive, some of the scenes were real space opera, a poetry of Kubrickan proportions.The tie-ins, as one friend, who's quite the Trekkie said, were quite a few, but this time around more delicately added and that also put a smile on my face.I recommend it to everyone and anyone who loves a good space adventure, even if he/she is not a fan of the series-because of that sole reason alone.Now, the script is more elaborate, more twists are involved and, ahem, John Harrison (Cumberbatch) is probably the best written villain of recent memory.Worthy of a mention are his scene-stealing appearances on the Enterprise as he was locked on the ship.Sherlock just makes acting look a child's play.The film itself is darker as promised, and i will see it again, because so much is happening at once, because it has it's flaws (everyone are superhuman, for instance, jumping back and forth through outer space looks like i can do it tied-handed and blindfolded).But it's moral dilemmas are overwhelming, and some moments are, in that respect, quite unforgettable and special.And for a film who wants to achieve much, greatness even, i believe this is the most important part indeed.It is a)-special, b)- harder to forget and c)just look at Cumberbatch, seriously, look at him.They say good actors are those, who can stay stone cold in one scene, and weep in the next-but he does both things.At once.In a single shot.And also i cannot say i remember anything from Kirk and Spock's first outing back in 2009.Only the technicalities on their ship pre-flight, the multinational flight squad, Anton Yelchin speaking weird (he does it again, but not as irritating) and some scene with a giant fire ray coming over from a planet (which i think , no disrespect, was destroyed- it even might've been Spock's planet, but it made no difference whatsoever, because i was not feeling it, because they were not feeling it).That's all can remember.But now they do, it all looks better emotional-wise and i'm grateful to all of the cast for that.Because of that, this time around, i won't be having the trouble remembering at all!An almost great, independent (from the old-school Star Trek universe) and original film.My rate 8.2/10",8,30,64,10 May 2013
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Went in with low expectations, ended up surprised.That's how a game adaptation should look!
","To be honest, i wasn't a big 'Prince of Persia' fan, i haven't played the games, but i probably will now, because the film is great.The movie is shot in great style, well adjusted to it's time and era.And this means costumes, effects, traditions-everything.I have a friend, who's waiting for this movie for a few years, early 2007 to be exact.We went in, and he was totally blown as well, and said there are more similarities with the game, than he could've imagined.So it's story is actually accurate and believable.The acting was at a very high level, equal to the scale of the movie itself.I like Jake Gyllenhaal for a long time, since 'Donnie Darko' and than he was great in 'Brokeback Mountain'.But i never could've imagined he'll fit so good in a blockbuster movie like this.Gemma Arterton is also cool, as she is in 'Casino Royale' or 'Clash of the Titans', where she's actually one of the few things i liked.But here, she has more on-screen time, and she shows her talent more fully and that's a lot for a movie like this-a blockbuster.Another thing, that's not very common for a cash-making movie is the dialogue.There are some pretty edgy and funny lines one could enjoy, especially in the hands of the leads in the movie.Once again, they did an outstanding job.I can't wait till the day i'll see sir Ben Kingsley as the good guy in a movie of such scale.I doubt it'll ever happen, but i hope it will.He was better than most of his villains, more convincing than before.I liked him.There was a little mystery as well.Who is the killer, who's guilty, many people can be responsible for what's happened.I didn't expect such things, and was left surprised by them too. The lenght of the movie is one of the many good things about it.It was long enough, not too long, but perfect.I was a little bit disappointed of the ending of the movie, i don't like endings like this, but i haven't played the game, so that must be the reason for me to feel like this.Go see for yourself, because i'm sure You won't be disappointed! I went in and i enjoyed it.The best blockbuster/summer movie this season.I'll see it again, very soon, with more of my friends.My rate: 9/10 Agh, what the heck, sheer 10.I'm a fan now!",10,21,42,23 May 2010
Oblivion," Engaging From the First Moment to The Very Last, But Blink-and You'll Miss It !
","Every passionate moviegoer (as myself) has a certain annual wish-list of films, he/she is willing to do everything to see ASAP.And as a sci-fi fan, it has from some time been a foregone conclusion that Oblivion stands at the very top of my 2013 must-see-at- all-cost list, right up there with Elysium and Riddick among others.So the time finally came and in the time of writing this review, this nutbag moviegoer has seen the film twice.Because, love it, or hate it-you must admit, that blink-and you've missed it.Shut down for a moment-and you've missed it.And that's what's so fascinating about this experience.For those of you, who know Joseph Kosinski-i don't need to tell you, that he's already proved (Tron:Legacy), that he is unparalleled in his vision and style.As if he was born to do sci-fi of the highest order.And even if you wanted, dear reader, you actually cannot look any further than Tron, because there's literally nothing to look at.He is indeed new, but that doesn't seem to be bothering him nor his impeccable vision.The screen writing is also strong, contrary to critics believes.I found the collaborating between so many people in that department rather useful.In most examples, when one has a few writers or directors, the end product becomes rather divided and visibly shaken and chaotic at moments.But the story with Oblivion is very different and unique in it's own way, thus making it all the more special for us.So, with such an elite team penning the script, Oblivion grabs you in it's clutches and doesn't let go until the very end, when all the questions you had during the build-up, are either left open for you to decide what to believe in, or unfold logically, without ruining the whole mystery and mesmerizing enigma and integrity of the film, thus making it an experience, the first must-see Experience of the year to date.And with such a talented group of people at the helms, the only thing missing is an equally strong cast.And, boy oh boy, didn't we get one (that's right, Olga Kurylenko, i'm talking about you).As a person, who's seen the film twice, i consider myself lucky to have been able to focus solely on the actors and their expressions and emotions throughout the second view of the film, so soon after the firs one (it's all still fresh in mind this way).And it's fitting to begin the examination of the actors and the human factor from the man in the front, Mr. 100 million dollar man Tom Cruise.I personally dislike the guy, because of the lack of emotions on screen and the wild personal life off it.But let's focus on the screen-in films such as all 'MissionImpossible''s, i just can't feel any emotions in Cruise, i understand he must be coldblooded and decisive as Hunt, but even the affection he should have been allegedly feeling towards his loved one, just wasn't there.In his more recent Jack Reacher, it's the same.Rosamund Pike is reaching out, but he's not responding.But here, he's oddly terrific-he even manages to break a tear or two in a few moments.He feels more human, than he does in the films he actually portrays one.But here, although just a number (roughly said, he's more than that), he has all the emotional mojo going on for him.Andrea Riseborough' Victoria is a little bit colder than needed, but given her looks, i assume that was the idea all along-a precise, even perfect (on the outside), yet cold woman-a perfect description for a flawed, non- functional 'human' being. As one of my most beloved actresses, Olga Kurylenko's fallen angel, Julia, on the other hand, is Vicka's complete opposite.She's warm, full-blooded, a human being in every sense, and Jack's heart rightfully belongs to her, even when she is nothing more but a distant memory, a dream that comes at night.Even with his memory erased, he still sees her as his love, his life in a past world, not yet plagued by destruction.All that time he has been waiting upon her return in his life.She is even willing to sacrifice herself for the sake of all rebellious people left on earth, in order to preserve a little bit of that world she knows still exists in the heart of the still living humans led by Morgan Freeman and ass-kicker Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, and, of course, Jack.Both she and Jack understand the meaning and the consequence of an eventual sacrifice, because they both know and with her help, they both remember and see, that really 'Earth is a memory worth fighting for'.Aside from the strong tagline, which comes to great aid of the film, and a very accurate one as well, the Cruise/Kurylenko pair is a marvelous one, and after seeing her portray Julia the way she did, i no longer feel sadness over Jessica Chastain's (another muse of mine) drop from the film early on.That's how awesome and human Kurylenko was.Just look at her mesmerizing and beautiful eyes, they express a waterfall of emotions throughout.The just say it all...And that piece of Paradise Jack has found and made for them at the meadow by the lake, is the most deserving and fitting finale for the two, although there's always a sour note that one must digest.But i won't spoil it for you.But in the end(linger with me just a little more), Oblivion answers most of the questions it raised, and leaves others intentionally wide open.But the human aspect of it, will remain in my mind as the strongest quality this film possess.And the sheer brilliance in the visionary aspect of it.A fitting finale (the last heartbreaking & in the same time-heartwarming scene in particular) to a fitting summer 2013 opener and my number one so far this year as well!A deserved 10/10 for Kurylenko, Cruise, Kosinski & co. for the masterful job on Oblivion!",10,26,50,20 April 2013
28 Weeks Later," As Satisfying As The First One
","When I heard about a second part, a sequel not being directed from Danny Boyle, I was sure that it'll be messed up and definitely not that good.But after I saw the movie, I wasn't disappointed at all.It was surprisingly good and the plot was even better than the first one.The acting was at a high level, although the chemistry director/actor was stronger in the first one.This one is entertaining as well, the visual effects were very good and all of the cast did their jobs perfectly.There was solid action, but drama too, and the atmosphere from the firs movie isn't lost at all.The directing was very good, visionary stunning.The hawk eye views of the city were cool and at the right moment every time.The actors played their roles perfectly, especially the kids.I cared about them all the time, they were outstanding.The movie was very good and intense from the beginning to the end-stunning! 7.3/10",8,0,0,3 August 2009

","I have watched many Sci-Fi's, but to be honest I have never felt like this before.On the way out of the cinema, I couldn't stop thinking about the movie.I was staring in nothing most of the time.Maybe, just the sun made any difference about me.Nothing else couldn't bother me.I have never seen a movie like this before, there weren't any obvious flaws and the acting of Nicolas Cage was sheer brilliant.It was disturbing and dark in a way.I was expecting something to happen all the time, leaving the cinema.I like all Nicolas Cage movies, but here, he is...WOW.I was speechless after that and I think that every Sci-Fi fan should go and watch it.Cage and Proyas are just geniuses! 8/10 The movie is different and compared to the last Sci-Fi-releases is just outrageous!",7,5,10,28 June 2009
28 Days Later...," Very Impressive!
","I have to say that I should have watched it earlier, but when I saw Slumdog and Sunshine I knew I'll do it.And I wasn't disappointed at all.The chemistry between Boyle and Murphy is obvious and a very good one.Murphy is like a born Boyle-movie actor, (he does his job perfect in Sunshine too).The film follows the story of a courier, that wakes up in a hospital after an incident.He is rescued by two survivors from an army of infected people.Than they go north hoping for shelter and survival at a military road block near Manchester.The film is very well directed and the plot is full with action and intense moments.If you want to see a pop-up out of nowhere zombies movie, that is not the movie for you.But if you're going for something really good, for a intense action/thriller movie with good plot, acting and directing, that's the movie for you.I only have to say, that sometimes Boyle's movies get a little lost during the development.They have a little bit of everything-it has drama, romance and entertaining moments as well.But in this case this makes the movie even more likable.I didn't realized how fast I thought the movie ended-I haven't checked my watch at all.The movie is intense, entertaining, dramatic, thrilling and even epic-very impressive!Danny Boyle's best work in my opinion! 8/10",7,0,1,1 August 2009
2012," And the Oscar goes to...
","I have just came back from a screening of the movie, and i have to admit i liked it.Something you should expect from Roland Emmerich is the good SFX and of course...well, the disaster type of plot.And the plot is obvious-the world comes to an end as we all know it, the people try to save themselves and etc. , etc...But this time it was a little bit different.I don't know if it was, because of the effects or because of the cast(especially Woody Harrelson-hilarious as ever!), the movie managed to give me something, i haven't seen or felt since 'Independence'.There weren't any Oscar performances, but the cast really made the binding and the chemistry between them.That helped improving upon Emmerich's last tries(especially 10K B.C.).The rewards they might and will receive is in the SFX's zone of the movie.Looked from this angle, the movie was one hell of a roller coaster ride!The intensity was great, not too slow, although there was a place for more improvement, which could've made the movie even a better ride for us, moviegoers. After all the characters were likable, we received a different, new angle of the end of the world type of movies, and it was entertaining and epic enough.THE Master of the end of the world/disaster movies won't disappoint, because 2012 is THE Ultimate Disaster Movie ever made!!!It's an epic journey, won't disappoint!!!

","I bought 'The Hurt Locker' DVD a few days ago, and had the chance and time to see it this morning, since it's been so long out there, but not at our theaters, unfortunately.Or at least, i thought so.The movie tells the story of the solders, rotated to Iraq, their relationships, with the locals and with each other.Team Bravo are a bomb squad with the mission to locate and defuse different kinds of bombs in the territories of the city Baghdad.There were many bright, fresh, new ideas and some intense scenes as well, but i won't ruin it for you.But also, there were some big problems i saw, at least with me.Let me make a short list.I won't write down the things i liked, because they are many and very obvious for the viewers, considering the awards the movie won and the upcoming Oscar noms, which won't be one or two.The things i didn't liked: * LENGHT:I thought the movie was too long.There were some expanded scenes, that didn't make much sense.Scenes, where main characters stare at each other for a couple of minutes or some, were very annoying to me.In war movies, that's not that good.* PLOT/STORYLINE:In my opinion, the long scenes were there only to cover some plot holes and actions, that couldn't fit well in the movie.SPOILER HERE>>>Angry with the death of a boy, one of the leads goes on a search for the people, responsible for the boy's death.Then, at some point, he just stops the search, confused<<<.Even if there was some message in his actions, it was blurred, unnecessary, pointless and could've been skipped.Also, after a mission two of the leads pretend, they're fighting.They're obviously playing and chilling up, but the scene is too long and pointless.* CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:There was a very good development indeed, but some of the actions of the lead were simply unthinkable and irrational.If the movie's goal is to show the war in Iraq in it's true face, then those actions are needless.The lead is like the lone and unaccepted action hero, saving the day by himself, making things even harder for both him and his team.A real sergeant will never put his men in such position, threatening the whole unit.But those things could be found, again due to plot weakness at some points.Those are the problems i found.As a whole i liked the movie, but i can't say the things, the movie critics say.I can't appreciate the movie, as some of you do, at least not that much.The movie was good, fresh and a different point of view at war and at the people involved in it.The actors were very convincing with their plays, with the emotions, they express throughout.Because war is emotion.War is a drug.My rate:*** out of *****Edit:Rent 'Jarhead' instead.",5,6,13,29 January 2010
Avatar," Visional Triumph.WoW.The year's Best-'Avatar'
","I came back from an IMax 'Avatar' screening a couple of hours ago.It was snowing outside, so I just tried to watch up the sky and imagine I'm at the theater again and I'm enjoying the Movie again.Because this IS the Movie.One of the year's finest, if not THE Finest.I was absolutely taken into the story and than blown away by everything-the characters, the nature. the visuals, the emotion...The whole idea as well.The alien concept is very strong.The planet's concept as well.All the action is happening in the Alpha Centauri A Solar System, on one of the moons orbiting a giant gas planet called Polyphemus.There are many moons around Polyphemus, but the most important of all is Pandora, where everything takes place on.Polyphemus is visible in Pandora's sky, as well as a few other moons orbiting around the gas giant.I'll leave you to visualize the whole world of Pandora-beautiful rain forests and planets filling the skies.And because of the new world Cameron has created, it all seemed a reality.Everything had this typical Cameron touch, a touch to the very last detail.All of his movies deserve to be seen, and 'Avatar' won't disappoint as well.It really changes the course of worldwide cinema, because Cameron's genius has created not only a believable plot, but a humanoid one.To destroy something that beautiful and innocent, that's only in our nature.And we quickly begin to take the Na'vi side.They're the indigenous population of Pandora.And you feel as every single moment of the movie is something new, kind of unpredictable and unique-not because of the story, but because of the environment, the nature, the Na'vi people and the feelings and emotions throughout.You will get literally in love with all the characters.And surprisingly, only a few of them are humans.You'll love Neytiri the most.The Na'vi princess is so beautiful that you'll be left dreaming of her and the world she lives in.The emotions she express are more real than the emotions the humans are expressing throughout.Although based on CGI, Zoe Saldana plays Neytiri beautifully and her role is one of the strongest, if not the strongest in the whole movie.Sigourney Weaver is strong and shines as well.Sam Worthington and the rest of the cast are also very good and convincing.You'll even have the feeling those People are real.That Neytiri and Jake are real, because they look as real, if not even more real, than the humans.And again, all thanks to James Cameron, who brought to life the Na'vi People and made them look in many aspects better than the humans.And that's one of the strengths of the movie.James Cameron is a genius and an artist and 'Avatar' could be his biggest masterpiece yet!!! I'm happy I saw it at an IMax theater, and I'll definitely do it again.It just deserves to be seen again and again, at a theater.'Avatar' is 'numero uno' at my top 5 list of the year and definitely among my top 3 list ever!Why not even at first...I loved the movie and I'm sure you'll do as well!!! God bless James Cameron and his latest Masterpiece! 10/10 of course!",10,6,12,19 December 2009
Mama," An Unforgettable Experience Brought By Muschietti, Del Toro and Chastain ! !
","First of all, my fellow moviegoers and horror-fans, i must begin by saying, that, even in a decade's time, i doubt that my instant love for this film would have changed in any way.Was it because of the wonderful work of the entire cast and crew on the film that struck me?Or even that rare feeling you get, when a film has been carefully nurtured with love and selflessness and raised up to be one of the best in the genre to come out for a good long while?Or is it the wonderful Jessica Chastain with a little mix of Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau's assuring performance as Lucas, and of course, Isabelle Nélisse's and Megan Charpentier haunting performances of Lilly and Victoria.And once we are rolling and underway, Muschietti and Del Toro never really let us go.Their ideas, their intelligence and vision, along with some brilliant acting, made this film a special cinematic experience.Suspense and horror wise the filmmakers have made a wise choice not to go with blood, gore and other clichés nowadays horrors are filled to the brim with.Another great choice is the masterful cast they have chosen-Chastain, Waldau the whole cast.And since i'm very fond of Chastain, i will get on the subject thoroughly in a moment.The film was shot in incredible style not revealing in the opening scenes and ,step by step, showing more and more, both story and emotional wise.Not only that, but with the titular character of Mama, we find more about her, we see more of her, and in the end, we experience what means being her, being all of them.This storytelling arc i found very suspenseful and the great character development in Annabel and Victoria, the bigger sister, lead up to the climax, which is very heavy on emotions, pain and a triumph of the director's extraordinary vision.Which, in my humble opinion, leads to the strongest quality, that this film has in it's possession:the cast!!Game of Thrones's Waldau does a really solid job portraying Lucas, the uncle, who never gave up on his nieces and kept searching, when nobody else did, he never let go.Isabelle Nélisse and Megan Charpentier are great playing the two wild, insecure, girls and manage to find the perfect line between this world and the civilization they are so reluctantly brought into by their uncle and his girlfriend.Although the word 'girlfriend' is very misleading in this situation, it does no justice to the relationship between Chastain's Annabel and Waldau's Lucas at all.Throughout the whole movie we have seen real love and real human feeling, not just a bunch of teens sleeping together and fooling around which basically happens in every horror movie.But here, people are full-blooded, real, emotional, humane.So, they clearly love each other, after all Annabel stayed with him in order to help him raise his nieces, they moved in a new house together, she left her life of the tattooed, beer-drinking, guitar-playing, Rooney Mara-resembling woman, that was not yet ready to be a mother.At the end, Annabel has become so fond of the girls, that she takes the role of a real mother, caring, protecting and loving them, when Lucas in not around.She is risking her own life for them and is gifted with the love of the bigger sister, Victoria, in return, which ultimately proves to be at the center of the main conflict-the unconditional love of two mothers towards the two sisters, and the choice that they have to make.A real mother, or Mama-a hurt, but jealous ghost, with a history of her own, a mother, who is able to take a life in order to preserve it, a mother, who defended the two children for years in the wild, as if they were her own, but not a real, full-blooded mother at all...There is no right choice here, which means things are ultimately going to end bad in one way or another...So, for those who were able to bear with me for so long, i'm going to wrap it all in a nutshell:this film is an experience, that needs to be seen, an experience, resembling a beautiful, but also painful story with no winners and real, human emotions.It reminds me of Nicole Kidman's The Others in a way...And being introduced to Jessica Chastain's warm and full-blooded portrayal of an otherwise clichéd character, that she shows has been played the wrong way all those years, is the most important experience for me.She was brilliant, and as i have grown to love Chastain for her roles in the past two years, for her devotion and skillfulness, she is the best choice for this role.If horror movies had more overall quality and were higher-regarded as movies not only made for the purpose of cheap jumps, but for enjoying a piece of film making of real cinematic value, in a world where scripts are better, Jessica Chastain could even get nominated for an Oscar among other high-profile awards for her mesmerizing and beautiful, yet humane portrayal of a forced-by-the-circumstances mother, ready to do anything to protect the ones she loves.So, with the 1000-word limit upon me, for one of the best films in the genre for the last years and a wonderful film as a whole, this piece of devoted filmmaking and acting, will keep you mesmerized until the very end and you'll be discussing it even afterward.It definitely left an impression on me, and i can't wait to see the beautiful Chastain again, as soon as possible, as she has proved to be equally impressive and devoted in every genre she has worked in and every role she has taken.The one-two, that's shaping up at the U.S. box-office this weekend for her, proves she covers more cinematic ground than most, and that the future is bright in her presence!I wish her the Lead Actress Oscar this year, as she absolutely deserves it for her work on Zero Dark Thirty!My rate:a deserved 10/10 !!!",10,53,97,19 January 2013
Rio," Rio-an epic, lovable, beautiful and visually stunning animation
","Not many animations like Rio come around these days.When i first saw the trailer and the team behind this very anticipated animation, the Ice Age team, i knew it will be very enjoyable and fun to watch.Seeing a TV spot right now, i remember that it was all those things, but much more as well.The quality of the animation was unique-only two or three movies can still compete with this and those are Tangled, Up and How to Train Your Dragon.But still, there was so much going on in Rio, the birds, the colors, the non-stopping stream of movement, lights, music and songs, around the carnival in Rio or in the opening and closing scenes with the singing and dancing of the birds in the forests around the city.So much was going on and with such quality, that no animation has matched.And those epic proportions of the animation are its strongest qualities.Something one can't see every day.The character development was very good, beginning with a little background of the macaw bird Blu's life, with his owner Linda in Minnesota.Maybe, the other macaw, Jewel, was a little underdeveloped as a character, but with positive reviews coming, there might be a sequel coming on the way as well.Then, Jewel's background might be better developed.With an animation of such proportions, some box office power along with a few Oscar noms will surely be along the way and the fact that it takes place in Rio alone, will act as an audience magnet, given that Rio's one of the most popular and non-stopping cities in the world.This magical feeling stays all along the movie.You just can't forget you're in Rio.Rio is as well another example of an animation, worth the time and money of both young and grown-ups.That's what catches the eye.20-th Century Fox has made a great animation and with the possible box-office power of the movie, a sequel might as well be on the works.So, a great animation, very epic and visually stunning, Rio will keep everyone mesmerized and captivated long after the end, and personally for me is one of the best, if not the bast animation i've seen.I definitely hope for a sequel and i'll definitely see it again, at the movies.10/10 for this stunning, colorful, heartwarming and breathtaking experience, named Rio!P.S.The one thing i thought was missing, was Bellini's Samba De Janeiro- this song can make the mood of every crowd in the world :)",8,95,143,10 April 2011
How to Train Your Dragon," More mature than 'Shrek'-probably one of the best animated features ever made.Worth seeing
","This was one of the moments, when you feel so overwhelmed by a movie, that you want to see it again immediately.And when i think of how the whole movie-going began-a theater, full of annoying, noisy kids, 3-th graders mostly.But in the end, you realize you haven't spent any time listening to them, because you are so fascinated by the movie.You feel you are alone in the otherwise overcrowded theater.This feeling is very precious and when you realize it, you know you loved it.The whole idea is very interesting-alternate Dragon-fighting times, an era of vikings and so many kinds of winged creatures.The main character, Hiccup, is the son of a mighty Dragon fighter-Stoick, who is the vikings chief as well.He wants to teach his son the Dragon fighting ways of the vikings, but the boy befriends one of the Dragons, a very rare kind, almost impossible to find.He names it Toothless and they are in for a lot of adventures.The movie is very fresh, but solid and strong as well.And considering it is an animation, the voice performances are very good.That is also important.But the truly strongest sides of the movie are the heart of the movie-it is really a moving picture, but i think, that the level of maturity of the movie is higher, than DreamWorks's previous efforts like 'Shrek'.It is more meaningful, and although it is a Dragon-fighting story it is more real than most of the studio's previous tries in this genre and definitely a step up in animation.The feelings, the emotions, that were expressed throughout made this animation such a memorable experience, and i'm sure, i won't be able to forget it, at least not soon.'How to Train Your Dragon' is a new, fresh, different start in the animation genre, with a lot of heart and emotions.I think, that's one of the best animations ever made.I recommend it to everyone-from parents with children to more experienced moviegoers and for the more mature audiences as well.'How to Train Your Dragon' is the best movie this year so far, and a honestly moving picture.An animation masterpiece!*****/*****",10,25,34,31 March 2010
Zero Dark Thirty," Jessica Chastain in Command ! ! !
","Do not get me wrong, the movie is not that good when you get the lovely, energetic, fascinating and brutally honest portrayal of Chastain's CIA agent Maya out of the picture.It would've still be solid, controversial and updated with events, but the X-particle would have been missing.That's what the actress brought to the movie.The cast is fine-a solid, convincing ensemble, that did their respective jobs very well.I can see why people like Mark Strong and James Gandolfini got some roles in the movie.It's always good to work with a so-called red-hot director at the helm of her so-called favourite turf- war movies.Their cameos, especially Gandolfini's (because Mark Strong was under the spotlights for a little longer) made a refreshing break from the main tone of the movie midway through it, at the moment we needed something different the most.Overall, the cast was an improvement over Bigelow's last effort in the genre.With 'The Locker' i wasn't impressed at all, i was actually on the other end of emotions-i did not understand what all the people saw in it.Overlong and flat, you' be left wondering why so many strange sequences occurred in the movie.And if you are still awake, that is.But Bigelow has improved in those few years.She has a better eye for the cinematic, her cast is stronger, she changes paste effortlessly and now has a sense of jumping in one scene after another almost flawlessly.Those things, in my humble opinion, were not that visible in 'The Locker' as mostly critics screamed they were.But the movie ended being the biggest Oscar contender and winner without being the best movie that same year, so what do i know.The only department 'The Locker' still overshadows 'Zero Dark Thirty' is the tension.No that it wasn't evident here, but more than enough was provided by Bigelow in her last effort.Well, frankly, the nature of the movie was different and couldn't have hurt it.So, with all that being said, with the beautiful performance by Chastain, who is becoming a real power on the horizon with every single movie she takes, with a haunting performance from Reda Kateb's Ammar in the beginning, where one might feel heartbroken for the guy, what's the problem with the movie, You might ask.The script!This thing that has been nominated out of sheer patriotism is worth nothing.Some of the lines Boal wrote were sheer ridiculousness at it's finest.No one screams words like 'motherfucker' in the CIA director's face at a high-level terrorist-related meeting, even if there is no profane context hidden behind it and even if the CIA boss's role has been handled by the almighty Tony Soprano.Jessica Chastain was actually so good and mesmerizing throughout the course of the movie, that she handled this particular scene with calm and confidence.She was the one screaming it, if it is not yet crystal-clear.And she's been forgiven, she's not to blame at all.Continuing with Boal's outrageous screen writing we find ourselves in the middle of a mission, where the SEALs (who behaved like total children throughout their limited number of scenes, shame on you, Edgerton, i'm looking at you, because one would expect this from Chris Pratt) enter a suspect's house and begin to quietly repeat every single inhabitant's name until, like rabbits, they all come out and they all get shot.A totally unneeded and distracting scene, which took off a lot from the sheer brilliancy and tension off the last sequence of the movie.And even if there were some documented evidence speaking that it was all true, i don't believe that a clever off-the-grid person will be so stupid to get out and check who is calling him by name in the middle of a SEALs mission in his home.I repeat, even if it were true, for the sake of the film itself, leave it out, do not go there!!That's why i think the final act was less suspenseful than Bigelow's last warfare effort.Besides the fact we all now how it ends, of course.And, once again, thank God Jessica Chastain is around to save the day and bring some humanity and emotion to the movie.:But what the heck, let's give a 100/100 to the movie, because we love America'.That's the reception right now, as it was with 'Argo'...and once again, thank the cinematic Gods for Jessica Chastain's true, emotional, fascinating, electrifying performance!!At the very end she showed that even in a job well done and even in the years spend doing nothing but this particular job, there is no consolation, there are no smiles, nor happiness.Only a 12-years long hole of emptiness that's being left there.Like a homecoming soldier, who still lives with his brothers in arms, Jessica Chastain's Maya-has a tough way ahead of her.A way filled with new strives and challenges, dreams even.But a long and tough way back to ordinary life, life as it was.This sense of nostalgia is brought in absolutely uncompromising way to the screen by Chastain.The movie itself would have been a 6/10 without Chastain to say the least, with Boal it falls even steeper, but this new actress (by Hollywood laws that is), makes this whole ride unforgettable in the coming awards-season.Two thumbs up for a lovely Chastain and hopefully an Oscar this time around!!My rate:9/10",9,34,74,12 January 2013
Whiplash," Tension, tension, tension!
","After seeing Damien Chazelle's Whiplash - a film the young up-and- coming director wished to do for some time now - being so beautifully realized and brought to life by everyone involved in the project, I was glad and relieved, mainly because I have seen the short film, which was pretty incredible.I believe that among the most telling facts about a film's fortunes and qualities, is the ability to broaden it's public, but in the same time not forgetting that cinema is not all about commercial success and mass audiences.Or with other words - a film that is not just eye candy and booms and explosions, but also craft, soul, dedication and wits.Those are some of the things not only the film itself possesses, but the people behind it have in abundance as well.The upcoming Miles Teller plays the young and dedicated student Andrew Nieman, who has the drive, the ambition to succeed and to be great, which is fine, as long as it doesn't derail your personal life.A lesson the young drummer learns the hard way.Blind ambition is the thing, that can describe our anti-hero of sorts, Terrence Fletcher a.k.a the brilliant J.K. Simmons, who has a thing for mindeffin' his students to the point of total physical and mental exhaustion and even depression.But he does it for a reason, for the sole purpose of finding the next big, even great, thing in jazz and in music as a whole.The next prodigy, the next 'Yardbird' Charlie Parker that will be otherwise lost, if not being pushed to the very limit.And boy, does J.K. Simmons nails it.Chazelle has done a masterful job in casting the two leads in Teller and Simmons.Their respective acts are full of purpose, full of tension and ultimately terrific.Expect some awards going in the way of 'Whiplash' and look out for Simmons in the Oscars shortlist, that's how good he is in it.And in his own words: 'What a shame we wrapped it up in only 19 days'.It must have been really fun playing a part like Terrence Fletcher and Simmons completely sold it.As I said, the best movies are those, that reach out to the most diverse and wide spectrum of audiences, not those, who can connect to a massive number of people, who are representatives of only one specific audience type.And Chazelle has achieved just that with 'Whiplash' - a precise, tension-building film, full of beautifully staged pieces and above all else, a love towards music and the challenges it often represents if you want to get to the very top.The film ended in a big round of applause from the packed theater and I am sure that will be the case a long time from now!My grade: 9/10",9,277,383,28 October 2014
Inception," Incredible-Nolan keeps improving and Inception is by far the best improvement!
","I saw Memento very recently, something that turned out to be a great miss.I saw it again, just to make a couple of thins straight-and i'll definitely do the same with Inception.Christopher Nolan keeps improving himself, with even more complex and multilayer script like this.And i thought Memento was hard to reach by most of the viewers, but no.Inception will keep you mesmerized and captivated by the genius, that's hidden behind it.And not just directors and screenwriters (or with other words-Nolan), but with acting and sound-and effects and editing as well.When you have a cast like this-i mean Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Michael Caine, or Marion Cotillard (a personal favourite), the movie just keeps going flawlessly.Most of the crew is the same the Nolan brothers worked with on TDK and earlier in Batman Begins.So the Oscar noms in those categories are a certainty for me.The only thing one could have against the movie, is the headache one could have.See, most of my friends go to the movies for brainless action, they enjoyed Iron Man 2 and The A-Team, but this movie-you have to see it at least twice, to understand it.The levels and the layers on which thing are happening are so many, that one surely'll miss something vital.This is a reason for not fitting to the mass audience, but i hope that won't happen, because Nolan is one of my favourite directors/writers, and he showed, that the brainless action flicks aren't all of it.There are still movies like Inception out there and still people like the Nolans to make those movies, so it's not all lost.And i hope this movie could show the audience that the story is still important for the experience one could receive, not the endless, constant explosions.Because this is really a one of a lifetime event.Saying that, i must say, that in a world full of remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels and God knows what, this is a unique chance to see something different and unmatched so far-a strong movie, that, surely will be Nolan's latest masterpiece! My Grade won't change-it's the same for all Nolan movies-sheer 10!",10,1199,1918,9 July 2010
300," Well Directed And Graphically Satisfying
","I have to admit I'm a huge fan of Zack Snyder's movies and in my opinion 300 and Dawn Of The Dead are his best movies.He is in top 3 of my favorite directors list.The film is epic and the acting of Gerard Butler as King Leonidas is outstanding!The rest of the cast is amazing as well.The plot has no obvious holes or flaws and, as all of Snyder's movies, 300 was a visionary triumph-the Snyder/Miller team did it perfectly and hopefully they'll repeat their achievement once more in the upcoming sequel/prequel of the movie and why not even top the effect.When I heard about the idea of another 300 movie I had big doubts, but if someone can do it-that's Snyder and Miller.And now I have more faith...300-one of my favorite war movies, one of my favorite movies at all and a visionary triumph with epic proportions! 10/10",10,1,2,2 August 2009
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Michael Bay has somehow done it-what an improvement, what a Sci-Fi.Genre-defining!
","The Transformers series are a very strange and curious trilogy.The first was interesting, a little longer than the plot was capable of handling, but nonetheless enjoyable for what it is.Then, the second one came around with initial reviews claiming it was a loud-explosion mess of a movie.Yes, i left the theatre deaf as a post, but i still accepted it for what it was-a brainless, one-liner, visual effects driven non-plot having extravaganza, that can take your ears to the grave.Yes, it was a little sub par on plot and substance, but i enjoyed it for what it is-a summer Michael Bay movie.Now, with the third coming, i must say, that all of you, who were left unhappy, deaf and unsatisfied, you must forget it and see the third part as a reincarnation in a Sci-Fi classic, just like the likes of the nowadays Inception, or District 9 and so on, but with more effects, less inappropriate noise and featuring one of the most breathtaking scenery of giant robots fighting on 3-D.The technical part of the movie is done better than ever, on par up there with Avatar (yes, it's getting a cliché, but it's nevertheless true)and there is a believable plot, considering the flops they used to call stories in the first two movies (again, compared with this, of course).The acting isn't great, but it's an improvement, considering the movie's improvement in any other department as well.Even Rosie looks a little better than Megan Fox.Shia LaBeouf is the running man again, and with some additions such as Patrick Dempsey, John Malkovich and even the twist in Turturro's character, Transformers 3 looks fresher than ever.With good reviews coming from literary everywhere right now, i do hope people will believe, because this movie does not deserve to be in the box office shade of it's predecessors, because it is so much better.So, i'll leave you with this-go see it not because you still have faith in the franchise, but see it because as it looks to you, the movie is really different from the other two (which Bay also claimed to be 'dark'), and last but not least, see it for the mind-blowing SFX's, which have not been seen since December 2009...A great summer movie, a modern action, Sci-Fi movie, which will wind up in many movie collections over the years to come!Ny note:10/10",8,90,181,20 June 2011
