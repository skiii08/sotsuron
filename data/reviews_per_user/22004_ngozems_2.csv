The Avengers," Indescribable!!!!!!!!!
","If I could rate this movie higher, I would. I have never sat down to rate a movie, ever...so well done to the entire cast and team. Very good job done. I have never been into Marvel and my introduction to the world of Marvel was Iron Man and the Hulk some few years back...yet this movie has made me want to look for these comics and read them. Care was taken in developing this work and it shows. The dialogue was witty, action was great...amazing how they all work so well together in the movie. Beautifully produced. I already want to see it again!Can I say though, for Cineworld Milton Keynes, 3D was not too fab, if you are seeing in 3D, the action scenes are where 3D works best, all other normal dialogue scenes are clearer with the 3D glasses off.So there you are, what are you waiting for? Go see this movie...well worth every last penny!......by the way did I mention a couple of hot sexy guys?(*wink)",10,3,8,28 April 2012

","I have officially fallen in love with Bradley Cooper. And Jennifer gives an Oscar-worthy performance. Truly deserving of all the hype. This is a love story with a huge difference. It's not cheesy, you don't roll your eyes, not predictable, not trying hard to be something and failing. It is an awesome tale with different twists and turns, of love, heartbreak, life, moving on and a tale of how family is supposed to be...not perfect - just family. I cried, I chuckled and I was glad I decided to see this movie. If you see only one movie in your lifetime...this should be the one. Very well done. Every single one of the characters, you can identify with...well except maybe the cheating ex- wife. I can't say enough good about this movie. I honestly don't remember the last time I saw a movie as original as this.Bravo to everyone involved in this movie from writer to producer to actors to crew. You have a standing ovation from me. :D",9,0,2,6 September 2013
