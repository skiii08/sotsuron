Black Swan," disappointed
","What to say... Well, this movie simply did not do it for me. Yes the performances and the accolades for Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis are well deserved and all in high order: the dances, characters and the acting is spectacular and spot on. BUT the story + execution is what is at miss here and what really spoiled the movie for me. The whole movie you simply do not know what is reality and what is fiction of her imagination. So the whole movie you are stuck sitting there and thinking: 'Is this for real or is this her mind- yes it must be her mind because it is just so simply messed up...' What is exciting about that? The art of the movies is to portray it in such a clever way that while you know something is a mind trip you still know who is having it and why, and you can still 'pretend' or get into the role why they are having it - but in this movie there is nothing that the viewer can identify as reality vs the psychosis of her mind so everything becomes psychotic and fake. And that for me is a bad movie. Again, performances were spectacular but the storyline and especially the execution in my view was a huge flop and the reason for making this movie a sub far flick.",5,11,35,24 December 2010
Hot Fuzz," Ahhh the British Humor...
","I must say that this movie is not what it may look like from the cover: a serious cop gets stuck with fat Mr.Bean kind of a partner and they must learn to work together while catching bad guys. True, there is a serious cop (Sergeant Angel) and plenty of dumb/lazy/slow or simply crooked cops from a small town he gets transferred to, but it's not just a comedy movie- there's some mystery, action and the way the dark angles are shot, characters developed and sub-plot stories introduced, it all really adds a very interesting addition to what at first seemed as a silly comedy movie. There are some things that are perhaps a bit forced and far-fetched (especially when we learn who is behind the murders and all the shooting begins), but I guess this is where it is apparent that besides the mystery/action components, Hot Fuzz is first and foremost a comedy and then a bit of everything else mixed up in a fuzzy ball of Brit humor. Not bad.",8,0,2,18 September 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," A Fitting Closure
","I must say I enjoyed this third installment - I can't say that it was better than the first one, or amazing by any standard, but I was glad that it was fun but also gave us an appropriate closure. The only problem with that of course is that it was a quite predictable closure: The Bad guys get what they deserve while The Good gang prevails- more or less since not everything can be so perfect for the winning side either. As expected poor Will Turner must be sacrificed in one way or another and severed from his lovely Elizabeth... I shed a tear here (almost).BUT despite this predictable plot, I sincerely enjoyed the movie. It was a tad long (almost 3 hrs) but the cinematography was great and the screenplay developed in reasonable speed and manner which is something I look for in a movie. Now another reason why I enjoyed it so much could also be due to fact that it is supposed to be the last movie, as whether that will stand true remains to be seen, but I like it when movie-makers know when to stop instead butcher the story and drag in on for years with new sequels and triquels and whatevers coming on annually.Recommended- even if only as a cheap movie night choice.",9,1,1,18 September 2007
Spider-Man 3," Nothing Special....
","At least not for me, but mind you I outgrew Spiderman long time ago (probably the same time as I did the Santa Claus), but there's something for everyone and I know there's plenty of comic books fans out-there so why not keep making the movies, right? I guess, but in that case you must face the consequences of making it fun and exciting especially when doing a 'trequel' of any kind of a movie, especially comic books. Perhaps the true comic book Spidey fans will always find something new and appealing in a movie like this, but (unfortunately) folks like me will come out of a movie theater shaking my head.So what are my pet peeves: I'm really getting tired of seeing Tobey Maguire's face and Kirsten Dunst's grin- he is so not a superhero material and she is just.... annoying. And their break-up scene felt like a HS drama class presentation. In addition, watching Topher Grace as an arrogant/nosy geek was just like seeing Eric Forman's evil twin= both rather tedious. There were some cool special effects and funny bits, but nothing super great. And does the Spiderman have to be such a softy all the time? He can't even kill a guy who killed his uncle or whop anyone's ass without the help of the black evil force which makes him into a pompous ass prancing and dancing around. And making fun of the French is sooo last year, but I guess flying heroically around the American flag in his face is always in style- go figure. And just as Harry and Spidey become friends again Harry dies. Lame.",6,0,0,18 September 2007
Once," you need to see it to appreciate it
","Describing what this movie is about is not enough to draw an average person to see it: after all it is basically about a guy and a girl who are brought together through the power of music, and a little help of the hoover vacuum. Naturally there is more to the story- and that something is the chemistry, honesty and the beauty of music which people have to see and feel for themselves. 'Once' is set in Ireland and revolves around a busker/artist (Glen Hansard) and a slightly eccentric girl (Markéta Irglová) who while passing by is drawn by his heart-felt voice and song. The guy and the girl clearly share a connection and a crush, but we learn that both have a history/ issues that prevents them from starting a romance- He is still in love with his ex gf who lives in London, while she is actually married and has a daughter. Still they continue their friendship and musical collaboration which results in his debut album. In a way, the movie is very realistic: Sometimes love is not enough- and most times love is just too complicated. Still, love can be beautiful when true emotion is felt. To say that Once is an independent movie is an over-statement: budget must have been under $200,000 but its shooting style and ambiance honestly made the experience that much more real and personal. The music was heartfelt and really beautiful- the two main characters are both actual musicians who wrote and sang all of their songs in the movie and on the album. Another tidbit of information I learned after watching the movie was that the guy and the girl fell in love during the shooting and ended up dating afterwards! That just makes the movie all the more special and realistic: real heart-felt music and real romance, what can be better? (Free popcorn perhaps ;)",9,2,3,17 December 2007
Knocked Up," That's it?
","This movie was more than disappointing- especially considering that I wasn't really expecting much to begin with. My biggest beef is that it was advertised as a semi-comedy when in reality it is a semi-depressing 'reality' movie. And they don't leave much as a surprise because we've seen all the punch lines and the plot highlights in the previews.So this is pretty much the story line: The pretty blond girl (Alison) and the not-so-attractive chubby guy (Ben) hook up by accident (as it often seems to be the case- at least in the movies and beer commercials) and well have sex without a condom- ooops. 8 weeks later she is pregnant and since in the end she decided to keep the baby the two of them decide to get to know each other and well- give the relationship a try and be responsible parents. But their lifestyles, attitude and personalities are somewhat different and well don't have any love sparks flying either so they go through lost of ups and downs through the movie but wait- their intentions are good and of course we have to have a happy ending so in the end they do make it after all, or so we'r led to believe as they drive in the sunset to a new sub-urban house. Awwwww...Now that is all fine and well, but the movie is a) really not that funny b) not that original or complexed c) you still don't know if they will really make it because they are so different, and as we have seen through Alison's sister and her family- sometimes even with love it takes a lot to make a relationship and family function. So in the end, apart from some funny screaming and swearing moments, the movie is pretty blasé- supporting characters are OK but nothing special, there is no charming romance or memorable lines- I guess they wanted to make a 'reality movie' but in that case why spend 10$ to see it- I can just pull up a lawn chair and watch my neighbours.p.s. The only person that makes this movie is definitely Miss Greys' - Katherine Heigl. Kudos to her.",4,14,25,18 September 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," Loved the suspense and the action scenes BUT not the shaky camera
","Seeing the first two prequels, I was excited to see how the third one would conclude the series.... and while I loved the action shots and the build up, I cannot say I was as happy with the conclusion.Basically, after the murder of his girl friend Marie Helena, Bourne is after the CIA with an extra zeal to uncover not only his past but expose to the public all of those behind the Treadstone organization. He gets some help from a news-reporter (Simon Ross) who was onto the Threadstone and operation Blackbriar. Just as Bourne is about to get more info, CIA surveillance team is after Ross to eliminate him and who ever is his source. Ross gets taken out by a sniper while Bourne manages to escape taking along with him Ross' notebook which reveals that his source is Neil Daniels CIA's station chief in Madrid. As Bourne is on his way to Madrid so is the CIA lead by the vicious CIA official Noah Vosen and Deputy Director Pamela Landy, who is more sympathetic to Bourne. On his way Bourne also gets help from another CIA personnel Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles). Finally after many car chases and fight scenes in Morocco and New York and with help from Pam, Bourne finally arrives to the Treadstone training facility at 415 and 71st Street to find out who were the people that made him into the monster killer he became. The truth however turns out to be partially of his own making since Dr. Hirsch who ran the psychological training reveals that Bourne - real name David Webb, volunteered for the program. Naturally it does not excuse what the program became and their actions, but it does send a message that we should not give our lives away so easily for someone else's cause and people's dirty business (hint hint army).That said, the conclusion didn't have the avengence feeling like expected, but the action shots were awesome. What I did not like was the shaky camera style of the film mixed with the awful South Keys cinema out of focus projection quality- we all had to squint at",7,1,2,13 September 2007
Burn After Reading," Coen Bros back on track!
","I donno about others, but I loved this movie! It was kinda hard to guess what it was going to be about from the TV previews but being Coen Bros and Frances McDormand fan, and given that Brad Pitt rarely chooses bad movie roles I figured if nothing the movie should be somewhat entertaining. And true enough it was more than that! Malkovich and Tilda Swinton only add to the amazing talented star power and make this movie a one crazy adventure. I don't want to reveal too much about the movie because even those little tidbits of plot are exactly what makes it so much fun, but I will say that it has the following: this movie is funny, silly, honest and tho far-fetched curiously and realistically believable- which is what makes it that much satirical, tragic and comical. All of the characters have their own issues and quirks and carry the weight of the movie fantastically - you never feel there is only 1 or 2 main characters; there are at least 5 or 6. I seriously cannot say enough about the talented cast which made all those characters come to life.",9,2,6,30 September 2008
Ratatouille," Rats are cool... just keep them out of my kitchen
","I saw this movie over the weekend and well, apart from the weird notion that rats anywhere (let alone in the kitchen) are OK, the Ratatouille was a fun and well produced movie. Made by Pixar, the expectations in lines of animation were given - and it was delivered, but I was also interested in the storyline and weather it would have that whole family satisfaction experience, and like I said kids enjoyed it and so had I.It is a story of a rat called Remy, who with a very peculiar sense of smell and takes up interest in cuisine. However, his family (a traveling pack of garbage scavengers) doesn't agree with his new liking of humans and cooking. As luck would have it, after one accident the family is separated and poor Remy is left alone with his only and favorite possession- a cookbook of a celebrated (and also deceased) chef Gusteau, who as a figment of Remy's imagination gives him all kinds of guidance and direction. At any rate, one day he finds himself at chef's Guesto's old restaurant which is now run by a seeming su-chef and an interesting kitchen staff and decides to live there and observe how food is made. This is how he befriends Linguini, a new kid that doesn't get any respect, but whose past will soon be revealed as very important in relation to Chef Guesteau. Together, Linguini and Remy take on the cuisine critics to prove that it doesn't matter who you are and where you come from, but if you love what you do and you have a talent- you should go for it! Apart from the inspirational message, I guess it can also make kids more interested in helping moms cook- or have rats as pets.That said, I wonder whether they could have had a field mouse or any other more pleasant rodent be the main character, since let's face it, no matter how cute they look animated, I doubt this movie will suddenly make me or general folk enjoy rats presence in the kitchen or a back alley. Other than that, great family movie.",7,1,2,18 September 2007
Control," Deep and Poetic
","There is really no other way to describe this movie but as that.I really had no super high expectations going to see Control, seeing I only knew 2 of Joy Division's songs: Transmission and She's Lost Control (which was the inspiration for the title), and practically knew nothing about the band or Ian's turbulent life- let alone that he committed suicide. But suppose that's what made the movie even more enjoyable and surprisingly spectacular.Sam Riley who portrays Ian Curtis was superb and spot on, and suppose so was Samantha Morton as his wife Debbie (even though her role was not as heroic and was actually quite annoying in some parts of the movie- but suppose that was her role so kudos for doing it so well).I also loved the fact that the movie was shot in black and white which added to the poetic landscapes, enhanced the mood and the effects of the time it was set in. In a lot of autobiographical movies on music singing and performing scenes can be the demise of the film (either cuz the actor is not as good as portraying the performer or it doesn't feel real, or is simply comes of as out of place and forced), but in this movie the music scenes were perfectly collaborated and performed by everyone involved.Once again, Sam Riley was spectacular at both Ian's impersonation of movements and voice, as well as his mannerism and the turbulent personal life- battling with responsibilities of family (leaving his loveless marriage with Debbie for another woman), the growing pressures of band and performances into which he pours all of himself, and of course the struggle with frequent seizures that threaten to take over his life completely.Overall, I would recommend this movie not only to music fans but anyone looking for a deep, realistic and moving picture.",9,3,5,3 December 2007
Enchanted," great for kids- which is all that matters I suppose
","Enchanted is a movie that combines half animation and half real life- which was quite a neat concept striking many funny scenes: like when live rats and pigeons are helping Giselle make her dress and fix around the house (although I did not like numerous shots of cockroaches in the bathtub nor do I remember cockroaches ever helping Cindarella or Giselle in any animated Disney movie). At any rate the movie starts in animation with Giselle falling in love with her prince charming (Prince Edward) and after 5 minutes of knowing each other they are to be wed. However, Edward's evil stepmother Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) wants to remain on the throne and has other plans for Giselle  mainly dispatching of her in some way- in this case pushing her into a deep well that leads to present day New York. The scenes of Giselle in New York were quite funny  she barely survives the traffic, can't find anyone to help her and gets her tiara stolen by a homeless man. Eventually she is helped by Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his little daughter Morgan, and even though Robert is little freaked out by her appearance and mannerism, (and rightly so) he helps her around New York as well as to find her the prince charming (Edward) who also arrives to New York looking for Giselle. Now to add to the complication- Robert has a long time girlfriend who suspects Robert is cheating on her with wacky Giselle, Prince Edward thinks Robert is stealing Giselle from him, Evil Witch's helper is in town trying to poison Giselle, and as she is getting to know Robert Giselle realizes that there is more to a price charming than being valiant and heroic  chemistry is a big part of it.I found Patrick Dempsey a bit dry (I could not shake off the McDreamy role), and Susan Surandon was practically useless (she has literally 5 minutes worth of dialogue). On the other hand Amy Adams was awesome as Giselle and she had most of the movie's memorable funny lines.",6,0,2,3 December 2007
Shrek the Third," Just Like Spider-Man 3 Shrek the Third Disappoints
","And what else is to expect from a third installment of the all-too familiar story which in this case brings nothing new and exciting to the plot, but rather plays on the popularity and the edge of the first original release? A little originality- Humor? Effort to make something similarly funny and memorable as the first or even the second one? I guess it was too much to expect.The first Shrek was awesome! All the characters had enough development time and we got to know their silliness and goofiness (the 3 piggies, gingerbread man, donkey and the puss)- but this time not only did these usual characters have limited (and rather blaah performance) we didn't get to see any new funny characters. Arthy (described as rebellious but seems more as a whimpy/skinny teenager) was as lame of a character as the eccentric poor ol' Merlin- not one funny line from either of them :( And the plot? When the King dies Shrek needs to take over the Kingdom but he doesn't feel fit- so he goes to search for Prince Arthur who is the second in line to the throne and convince him to take over the crown. In the meantime with the help of all rejected fairy tale characters Prince Charming decides to take over the Kingdom one last time (and succeeds). Shrek is back just in time and- yes you guessed it, restores the peace to the Kingdom. The End. Makes me wonder if the writers even put any effort into Shrek III or just pulled the screenplay out of their ass- probably the latter. After all, why bother when parents will still bring their children to see it based on the popularity and the warm fuzzy memories of the Shrek I. It's just sad that they clearly don't care to make a quality movie but rather money (surprise surprise).",6,0,1,18 September 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," The best one so far? Maybe, but I loved them all
","I saw the new installment of the Harry Potter at the IMAX screen and boy was it awesome!!! The sound, the picture quality and the couple of the scenes in 3D (like the ones where they pick up Harry to the Order of the Phoenix, and the fight at the Ministry of Magic) were super cool. I must say when the 2 hour mark came and the movie soon ended I was quite bummed out- I could have watched 2 more hours and I am sure so would have everyone else in that theatre. I mean, I know they can't put everything from the book in the movie, but if the Lord of the Rings can be 3.5 hours so should Harry Potter- especially for the books that have over 700 pages. That said, I must admit I never read Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (the size was simply intimidating) and now I regret it because I am sure I would have followed the story even better had I read the book.Another cool thing was to see how everyone has grown up- Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny and the twins, Neville and etc- they all look soo different from 2001 when Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone first came out. It is surely fun to watch them all grow and change through the movies as if it was in real life...And to simply wrap it up I shall say- the movie was awesome and I cannot wait for the next 2!",9,0,0,18 September 2007
The Last King of Scotland," Now I know...
","Why Forest Whitaker took home the big prize- he really deserved it! Not that I like his face very much or his previous roles I must say (especially since the last place I saw him was in that E.R. episode where he was a freak patient avenging his rage on Dr. Kovac), but this role was perfect for him... and he really delivered. You can really feel the insanity and unpredictability of his personality and rage- truly frightening...and I would never wanna be in a situation to depend on the mercy of his ever-turbulent mood.Now apart from the great acting, I can't say I loved the plot - our main character gets into such trouble in such a way that we can hardly feel sorry for him. I mean, I really have no sympathy for the skinny Scottish guy - Dr. Garrigan. Seriously, he didn't exactly do himself any favours: you are in a crazy dictator-run country where no international laws can save your ass under any circumstances, and here you are making best friends with a very unpredictable man who gets what he wants and has a knack for paranoia and insane moments of rage- and oh yeah also gives away death sentences like food stamps. And what do you do- sleep with one of his wives? Bad idea.In that retrospect I didn't like the development of the movie- unless that was the purpose, after all maybe it did happen, but as mentioned I definitely enjoyed Whitaker's acting.... as scary as it was.",10,1,2,18 September 2007
Inception," a tad too confusing?
","As a huge Matrix fan I felt Inception was stealing a few pages out of the Matrix script - the other times I felt either confused trying to follow the storyline. Mind you there were some really good special effects, the premise is decent (albeit predictable at times) but in general I think I expected a bit more from this flick. I mean the theory of illusion vs reality via sleep is pretty cool but the way they were presented lacked: some were a bit too far fetched and some simply hard to believe. It would have also helped if some concepts were explained more clearly and especially how the sleep machine really works. I feel there were too many holes left un-explained. Perhaps my I need to see it again to really appreciate it, but perhaps it simply needed more polishing out to be a masterpiece.",7,1,5,25 July 2010
Music and Lyrics," Looked Cute but didn't quite live up to the Expectations
","At least not mine. There were quite a few funny parts and Hugh and Barrymore really make a cute couple, but the plot unravels happened kinda too fast and was a bit too silly. It was simply missing something more real to settle it down and give it more personality. Seeing Hugh Grant do his pelvic thrusting for most of the movie wasn't exactly the highlight of my day, and there were some editing faults that were an eye sore as well- example when they are in the restaurant for brunch the camera angle switches from her back and front and it is not sycronized, one moment she holds her ice tea with left hand other moment it is in her right hand, then she is putting the pastry in her mouth and next shot there is no food in her hand. This goes on for about 2-3 minutes and makes me wonder how come they couldn't spot it. It gives me the impression that it was done quick, low budget and not very well thought out- just like the plot and the dialogue. Not to say that Hugh and Drew don't have chemistry or add life to the movie but could have been much much better.",5,3,7,18 September 2007
La Vie En Rose," should have been better- Edith deserves so!
","This movie could have been and should have been much better executed, especially when the main character is Edith Piaf who led such a turbulent and eventful life. But that is the problem with biographical movies: they are either a hit or miss; but what makes them great is not only to portray events and characters accurately, but a) not to make it seem like a boring educational biography and b) to make it easy to follow for those who don't know much about the topic at hand while still making it exciting for those who do. And this unfortunately was not the case in La Vie en Rose. I found that the chronological storyline and the timeline were awfully orchestrated; the movie kept switching to scenes from her childhood to old age, back to childhood and all over the place rather abruptly. Few times this was done very well, but others just destroyed the mood. For people that don't know her life story, the movie makes Edith look like a melodramatic, over-the-top alcoholic singer with penciled eyebrows- and this is hardly an accurate representation and only half of the story. Her rise from poverty to stardom was also overlooked- it came off as a simple switch without the true emotional impact it should leave on the viewers. The ending (last 15 min) on the other hand was superb, but it only made one realize how much better the rest of the movie should have been too. They could have explored her personal life more: even though he was her greatest love, she had more lovers and love affairs than just boxer Marcel Cerdan. The mood of the Paris, Europe and all the changes through the decades of her career (40s, 50s) should have been better captured- it felt like they were simply telling us a one dimensional version of her life with only half the story and even less emotion. Shame. Needless to say, the acting hand was superb- Marion Cotillard deserves all the praise (and perhaps an Oscar too).",7,2,5,17 December 2007
300," AWESOME! A Monster of a Movie!
","Most of my friends went to see this movie (much to my amazement) and I must say that my first preview impressions were rather flat- like come on, how many movies have there been with war, fighting, ancient soldiers, (Troy, the Gladiator) etc etc.... too many. But still, I went to see it on a cheap night and OH MY GOD was it ever good! First of all, I don't know why anyone would not like this movie: if you are a girl you get to watch all these Spartans prancing around flexing their perfect abs and thighs (wearing practically nothing) and get this: among all of their tradition and military-oriented way of life they actually treat their women with respect! Of course if you are a guy you get to see the Spartan war-machines in all their glory and might- and they don't fight to conquer or enslave= they just protect what's theirs. Now, Hollywood will embellish the story a liiiiiittle tiny bit (and add some super villains and monsters and special effects) but still, the account of their way of life and history was quite legit. But the best part of the movie is not the dialogue or perplexed storyline but the cinematography and the visuals! SO awesome and shot to perfection! At times unrealistic, but hey the emotion and acting was real (which is all that matters) and it is a movie after all.I won't go too much into what it is about- let's just say that the Persians are coming and the Spartan King Leonidas must decide to stand up for his people and disobey the corrupt priests and out-dated tradition. The prophecy says if the army goes to war the King dies and if they don't clearly the Persians will enslave them and the cities will burn. Hmmm what the King decides is no brainer, but it's not the outcome that really matters but their passion and the road to their glory!",9,0,0,18 September 2007
The Simpsons Movie," i was expecting a bit more...sniff sniff
","Maybe it was the fact that I saw all of the previews for the movie (sometimes not a good idea since majority of the best bits are shown in the preview leaving a few surprises for the movie itself), or perhaps I was simply expecting more from one of my favorite shows and the first Simpsons movie ever!I still enjoyed it very much, don't get me wrong- the spiderpig in particular was awesome, but I felt that the movie was a tad too short and that all of the crucial developments unraveled too fast.For example, the part where Ned adopts Bart and starts spending time with him had much more potential: more jokes and silliness involving Bart torturing Rod and Todd while getting back at the pig and Homer.By the same token, Homer and the pig could have had a lot more punchlines as the joke was already set up: example Homer could have started taking the pig to work, shopping or to Moe's- maybe even build a house for spiderpig and eventually moved in with him.Once the ecological bomb exploded on the Springfield what happened to the pig? How come everyone was able to escape through Maggie's sandbox sinkhole and how come it lead them directly outside of the dome? Once they arrived to Alaska the fun kinda stopped- I barely laughed at all :( The Inuit shaman scene was kinda weird and again a bit of an 'easy fix' for Homer to (finally) realize that polluting Springfield with the pig's silo was his fault and the city's future lies in his big yellow hands. Again, there could have been many more jokes about the state of the desolate Springfield when Homer came back.Characters were quite predictable- maybe too predictable: Nobody listens to poor Granpa Simpson or the eco friendly Lisa, Marge tries to mediate unsuccessfully, while Homer is the most socially irresponsible of them all- although the part were he put the buzzing hornets' nest in neighbor's mailbox was pretty funny.Overall, not a bad movie, but as a huge Simpsons fan, it could have been better.",5,1,3,13 September 2007
Atonement," excellent story- great acting- superb ending!
","I went to the screening of Atonement with a friend happy enough to see a free movie and not expecting much- Actually I am also not a big Keira Knightley fan neither so clearly I was just happy to be out of the snow and watch whatever was being shown.Atonement is set through 30s and 40s (mainly WWII) and revolves around the romance of the young Cecilia Tallis and the family up keeper Robbie Turner. Through a series of candid, naive and finally unfortunate events Robbie is accused of a heinous crime at the hands of the little Briory- Cecilia's little sister. The way this storyline and the plot are revealed and expressed was very original and effective in understanding what Briory sees and what actually happens. It is a perfect example how things aren't always what they seem, and makes one debate how much kids understand things and how reliable or guilty should they be of certain crimes.At any rate, needless to say, Robbie and Cecilia are separated, Robbie is set to prison then war, families are torn apart and as Briory grows older she begins to realize not only the consequences of her actions, but also why she did what she did which is just as important. I do not want to reveal how the movie concludes and what happens to Cecilia, Robbie and Briory because the ending of the movie was for me the best part of this film- despite how tragic or unfavorable it may be, it was very original and moving.The actress playing little Briory was very good compared to the one portraying the older one, and I was even more mesmerized by Keira Knightley whose performance is (do I dare to say it) truly Oscar worthy. She should stay away from Pirates of the Caribbean and silly movies like that and show her true talent in movies of a higher caliber. I was also very impressed with the visuals, the backtracking of the scenes and the storyline and the acting.Overall, I highly recommend this movie!",9,1,4,3 December 2007
