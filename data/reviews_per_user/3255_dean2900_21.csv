United 93," Extremely well made but not for everyone
","I will preface my review by stating that I gave this movie a 9 out of 10. I have NEVER given a movie a 10.I generally go to theaters or rent movies for entertainment. I would not call this movie entertainment but it is amazing in many ways.The director stuck to the known facts or at least all the facts that could be verified. There were comments between passengers that had to be added for continuity purposes but nothing that goes too far.You watch everything unfold that day from the 767s crashing into the WTCs and the mass confusion with the FAA, Military, Air Traffic Control, etc.What makes the movie so powerful is the fact that everything seems so real. The actors seem like real people and it really feels like you are watching passengers on the doomed Flight 93.There was also a great deal of tension created as the stewardesses walked by the terrorists on the plane. You knew they would strike but not exactly when.The last 20 minutes are extremely disturbing. You watch passengers called their loved ones to tell them goodbye. They knew they were going to die but they had to fight back. The conclusion was sad but also inspirational and respectful to those who lost their lives on United Flight 93.There was no part of this film that felt like exploitation. It felt more like a tribute to the passengers on Flight 93.I do think this is a great movie for most Americans but some will not want to see it and I can certainly understand why. I also know there are a lot of questions left opened about 9/11, conspiracy theories, questions about the commission report, etc. This movie does not look to question but only show what information could be ascertained from the people involved and try to recreate in as real as possible fashion.",9,0,2,4 September 2006
Deja Vu," Skip this one unless you only want mindless Hollywood action
","WARNING: Minor Spoilers First off, the movie does deal with Time-Travel but no real explanation given. The only explanation is the wormhole shown buy folding a sheet of paper make point A and Point B intersect which has been shown in numerous movies,by Stephen Hawkins, and probably on the 2nd gen of Star Trek Series.That is the end of the explanation. The government has created a machine that connect Point A to point B. They use it to look back in time and work to prevent a terrorist act.Washington (who is a great actor) does a decent job with the material presented but quite honestly,this move is no better or more realistic than Timecop although it has slightly better acting.If you want to see a good movie about Time Travel then rent Donnie Darko. If you want to see a humorous but unrealistic movie about Time-Travel then rent the back to the future movies.This movie is basically lake house meets Timecop. It has the action segments and the unnecessary love plot just to give en excuse to send Washington's character back to the past.With all this said, if you can turn off your brain, this is not a horrible rainy Saturday Movie when it comes out on DVD. It is just the type of movie you will soon forget afterwords. It is a typical Hollywood affair.",6,1,3,2 December 2006
It," Lacks any sort of tension, creepiness, and is over-hyped
","This second adaptation of Stephen King's It is making me question weather movie studios can buy positive reviews? This is not a horrible movie as the characters where fleshed out as much as they could be in just over 2 hours.It felt very much like Stand by me as a coming of age story minus any of the interesting things.This movie had ZERO tension at all. The movie simply played typical horror movie music and then had the loud jump sound as Pennywise jumped out which happened over and over. There really was way too much of Pennywise in the movie. Unfortunately, he was night scary or creepiness in the slightest to anyone over 8 years old.Dean",4,7,11,22 October 2017
Fight Club," An all-out attack on consumerism
","Warning: Spoilers This really is a great comedy. I never ready the short novel but do have read the differences. It sounds to me like the movie improved upon a short 200 page book.The male macho 'Guy Flick' persona is what Fight Club is disguised as. In reality, Fight Club is a strong attack on consumerism, corporate sponsorship gone mad, and a dark satire.The lead character (initially only known as the narrator) is your average corporate middle-class American. He works for a large car company and examines faulty cars. He is the man that determines which will save the company more money; A) Out of court settlements or B) A Recall of the faulty parts.The narrator flies across the country from city to city with what he refer to as his 'self-serving friends'. Anyone who has had a mainly travel job for a large company will understand this reference immediately.Our narrator is addicted to purchasing meaningless stuff. He buys the yen-yang coffee table, has a great collection of clothes. He asks himself what type of khakis defines him as a person? The point is of course what a person wears does not define who they are. The larger point is that the world is out of control and people are working long hours even at menial jobs in order to purchase things that they do not need and do not really make their life better.Norton feels so empty and suffers from insomnia and when his M.D. refuses to prescribe him sleeping pills, he starts attending groups full of people with terminal diseases. This acts as a catharsis for the narrator and allows him to sleep again. However, after some time he spots Marla who is a tourist to the group just as himself. This enrages the protagonist since he can no longer get anything out of the groups since Marla's presence bothers him so much. He ends up confronting Marla and they make agreements to who gets to attend which terminal illness groups. Marla makes a big play to get the brain parasites group. Marlas also comments that she has more right to the testicular cancer since Norton still has his. This is very dark comedy and is funny even if you feel demented for laughing at it.Once Norton's character meets the infamous Tyler Durden, things change for him. Tyler makes soap for a living and likes to talk about how easy it is to make napalm out of household items and orange juice. Tyler questions what a man is. He asks 'Is that what a man is' when he see's the Calvin Klien type ad on the bus.The Narrator's fancy Condo with all of his collections suddenly explodes one night leaving him homeless and without all his possessions. This is a pretense the movie uses in order to set himself free.The narrator then meets Norton for a few beers after his Condo blows up. Tyler says he can stay in his house. The narrator agrees but Tyler asks him for one favor first -- HIT ME AS HARD AS YOU CAN. The narrator hits him in the ear and Tyler punches him back. Norton has now found his replacement for the support groups.Norton's character then goes to move in with Tyler who lives in a condemned building in a bad part of town with limited electricity and were nothing works.The narrator and Norton get into another fight and onlookers get involved. Soon enough we have FIGHT CLUB. There are eight rules of Fight Club but the 1st two are NO ONE TALKS ABOUT FIGHT CLUB.The movie has a subplot that continues with Marla and Norton's character blackmailing his boss he can have fight night every night and the money. However, the main point of the movie is watching Fight Club turn into Project Mayhem. This shows a down wired spiral into madness or freedom depending on your point of view.By the end of the movie, the twist comes and the goal is to destroy history, consumerism, and the credit card industries.I will not completely spoil the ending for those who have not seen the movie but it is a good thing this movie came out in 1999 instead of after September 11, 2001 or they probably would have re-written the ending.",10,1,3,4 December 2006
12 Monkeys," Better the 2nd time around
","I first saw this movie when it came out in theaters and thought it was OK but nothing special. I saw it on opening night and I guess the movie was different than I expected.My 2nd viewing was in December of 2006 and I really enjoyed the movie. I guess the fact that I knew what to expect but forgot many of the details made it a much more enjoyable experience.I am not a big fan of Brazil and I thought the Brothers Grimm was horrid but I will say that Gilliam deserves credit for this movie.I am sure that this movie has more than quite a few reviews. I am aiming my review towards those who saw it once and thought it was so-so as a recommendation for a 2nd viewing.Also, If you liked this movie, I highly recommend Donnie Darko. They both deal with time travel but in very different ways. I personally gave Donnie Darko a 9 and Twelve Monkeys an 8. However, I think this would be a great double feature if you have a relaxed night.",8,2,3,7 December 2006
The Natural," Greatest sports themed movie ever
","You don't have to like baseball to like this movie. The fact that the majority of it takes place in the 1930s should keep it a timeless classic.Redford gives a fantastic performance as 'The Natural.' He is a man who has a natural gift who would have been the greatest baseball player of all time.He makes mistakes and life throws his a curve ball that almost kills him and ruins his chances of playing baseball.Fifteen years later a middle aged wonder joins the New York Knights to help the Knights in a Cinderella season Questions of Hobbs (Redford) background begin to surface, a crooked bookie tries to ruin his career, and a love story entangle him while playing the game could kill him.Hobbs shows true character and doesn't let the corruption overtake him. He plays the game for the love of the game. Yes, he has some self pity and regrets but he overcomes the odd as the leagues oldest rookie.I don't see how a sports movie can get much better than this. As in most great sports movies (i.e. Rocky) the sport is just to move the plot forward. The movie is about dreams, aspirations, and overcoming odds.This is a great movie to watch if you have never seen it an quite worth the rental or purchase if you have not seen it in aw while.This deserves a 9/10 as it is nearly a perfect movie.",9,0,1,9 January 2007
Zodiac," Well made but lacks suspense
","The movie is well made and has very good acting. I did give the movie 7 out of 10. However, the movie lacks any suspense at all. I felt like this movie could have been much better if they incorporated more suspense and add some fear to the movie.The movie honestly plays out like a Discovery channel documentary as the cartoonist gets more involved with the Zodiac case which leads to him discovering clues and things the cops missed out on during their investigation.The story is semi-interesting but not nearly as good as Fight Club or Seven by the same director.The movie only grossed 35 million at this time and had a budget of 85 million. Other than 2 early scenes, this movie could have easily been PG (not pg-13). It just didn't feel like a movie about a serial killer. It felt too much like a documentary and probably was a bad idea for the big screen.",7,6,9,10 July 2007
28 Weeks Later," Great horror/thriller (NO SPOILERS)
","I am appalled by how bad and by the numbers most new movies are these days. I find 9 out of 10 movies to be rated 5/10 or below and a much higher percentage of horror movies. This movie is the rare exception.I liked 28 Days Later but didn't think it was great. I also didn't expect the sequel 28 Weeks Later to live up to the hype. I was dead wrong. 28 Weeks Later easily surpassed the first movie.I am not going into specifics because I don't want to ruin this for anyone who has not seen this flick.I think it is safe to assume that everyone knows this is about a deadly virus that turns people into flesh tearing vicious killers.This movie was filmed beautifully (even being brutal). The director used great cuts, closeups, shaky cameras, loud audibles, etc but unlike many films he actually managed to create a feeling of dread and chaos.The movie also makes you feel sympathy for several of the characters and pity. It does show the best and worst of human behavior and emotions.Don't get me wrong. This is a very violent flick and probably extremely scary to many. The movies characters action do feel real whether logical or out of panic. You have to have a level of suspension of disbelief in order to believe the premise but the director pulls you into this movie.The movie starts out fast and furious and then builds the main plot before going back to the action, suspense, and gore.I gave this movie and 8/10 which is about as high of praise as I could give to not a zombie movie per se but very close.If you like good movies and/or like horror, this is a good one to catch. It actually might be too intense for some moviegoers.Dean",8,0,2,21 July 2007
Disturbia," Snoozefest
","This movie is a real snoozer. It takes 80% of the movie to build up to the meeting with the killer.The initial story is about a troubled teen who is under house arrest and begins spying on neighbors out of boredom due to his 3 month sentence.The hero starts to witness strange things at one of the neighbors house and finds out that he fits the profile of a serial killer. The teen has his friends including the gorgeous girl that just moved in next door help him foil the killers plans. You will know how the movie ends five minutes into it.There is zero suspense, not very interesting characters, and nothing new to the genre. I generally don't like PG-13 horror movies not because they lack gore but because they are targeted to a different market. However, a movie can build suspense and keep the viewers interest with psychological horror without much shown violence. Unfortunately this movie does feel creepy and has no bite. If the producer wants to use the first hour to build the story then good for him. However, the director needs to build suspense and have some thrills, etc. in the last scenes of the movie.Dean",5,8,14,23 April 2007
Rocky IV," 20 years later and this movie is really bad
","I am one of the few people on earth that liked Rocky III the best and this based a lot on knowing the characters from he first two movies. Rocky III as a standalone movie would not be great.Rocky 5 is horrendous and hopefully the Rocky Balboa which has not been released at the time of this review can be the 'unofficial finale' to the Rocky Series.I know we are talking Cold War times and Slyster Stallone was trying to make an anti war statement but this movie is garbage.We have the Russian boxer who is on steroids, trained by high tech equipment, and produces three times as much punching power as any other boxer in the heavyweight division.He kills Apollo Creed in the 2nd round of an exhibition match so Rocky agrees to fight him in Russia for free on Christmas day.At this point, the series has already killed off all the interesting secondary characters (Mickey & Apollo). Based on what was shown with the Dolph Lundgren character, it would have been impossible for Rocky to beat him yet Rocky goes the distance and all the fans in Russia start cheering for Rocky. Rocky knocks Draco (spelling?) out in the final round and gives a sappy anti-war speech. Maybe the movie was better in the time that it was made and I was 19 when I first saw it and didn't remember it being terrible. However, 20 years later, it is just a horrible movie to be followed up by a even worse movie.Sly should always be known as Rocky and there are some great movies in there which can inspiring but Rocky 4 is just an attempt to make money off the Rocky name.",4,1,4,16 December 2006
I Am Legend," Not very original CGI fest
","I am Legend has a great premise and could be a great movie. However this movie is really nothing more than an excuse for the studios to use as much computer generated animation as possible. The opening scene looks pretty good to see a desolate NYC but once the CGI creatures are introduced then it is nothing more than eye candy.Will Smith was OK in this movie. I do think he could have been very good with a much better script. His dog Sam was probably the most intriguing character of this movie.The biggest problem outside of the CGI fest is that the story was too short. It felt like there was a 2.5 hour story to be told that was rushed into 1.5 hours. There are flashbacks which explain part of the story but not enough depth at all. There are moments in the movie which I wont spoil with the detail that makes little sense.My recommendation is to skip this one and see either The Omega Man, The Last Man on Earth, or the wonderful 'Quiet Earth' which is probably of the best of the Last Man on Earth movies.",4,6,15,21 December 2007
The Illusionist," Wow! This is a great movie!
","I have to say that I am shocked how good this movie was. I was more interested in seeing The Prestige which I have not seen to this point. I will withhold judgment on the Prestige but I do not see how it could be much better.I do not want to ruin this movie for anyone. There are many twists and turns and the ending may surprise some and not others.The movie hits hard on heavy anti government (anti-monarchy), social classes, and many perennial ideas of love, faith, truth, and even science vs religion to a degree.I always did like magic growing up so I was interested in the movie dealing with such subject matter. If one can argue that Rocky isn't about boxing then you can certainly argue this movie isn't about magic or illusions.The one flaw the movie had was their really didn't seem to be any chemistry involved in the love story but I honestly could not flaw the movie for this because the love story was used as a means to an end.The Illusionist keeps you interested from the opening scene to the great finale and has a couple of magnificence performances as well as a genuine feel for the time-period in Vienna.This is certainly in the top 3 movies of 2006.",9,1,2,30 December 2006
Children of Men," This movie is hype!
","First off, let me say that this movie has a top proved top notch director and some top notch actors. The premise is intriguing and I was looking forward to seeing this film.There has been a lot of hype that this is the next Blade Runner.This movie makes Code46 look like a masterpiece.It's all hype and people trying to make you think you should like this. Forget all the rave reviews and judge the movie on it's own merit.I am not going to throw in any specific spoilers here. I knew the movie would be very dark and not have an optimistic tone which is fine by me. However, the characters are throw away. There is zero sympathy built for any of the characters and I didn't care what happened to them. In fact, I didn't care what happened to the world in this obnoxiously filmed movie overusing hand cams and making the future look the present.The ending of the movie is so anti-climatic and ridiculously inane that it makes you wonder how this movie got the green light.For the life of me I cannot figure out where the $80 million was spent. It looks like 2 million was spent on the movie and $78 million was handed over to critics to say how great the movie is.There are better episodes of the Outer Limits and a similar episode exploring the same themes done much better.I gave the movie a 5 out of ten which is generous only because of what the movie tried to accomplish. Unfortunately, it falls way short of being anything great.If by any chance you are watching it because of the references to Blade Runner then skip this one and watch Blade Runner again which was a dark toned movie about the future done right.",7,12,23,12 January 2007
World Trade Center," Skip this one and see United 93
","First off, let me say I have nothing but admiration for the policeman, fireman, port authority, and civilians who lost their life during this tragic event.However, I do not feel this movie serves them Justice. Maybe Stone was trying to be so cautious not to offend anyone that the movie became watered down.This movie has the same feel of the made for TV movie about the Nothern California earthquake with people trapped under debris.I cant fault the movie for not being 'exciting' because of the circumstances but it I felt no emotional impact from the movie. It felt fake and staged.My recommendation is to see United 93 which is an extremely powerful and while depressing movie, it is also uplifting in depicting the bravery of the doomed passengers on that flight.I gave this movie a 5 out of 10.",5,1,4,9 December 2006
A Clockwork Orange," Great movie. Has aged like fine wine
","I prefer escapism but I do occasionally enjoy a movie that has a a point to make and A Clockwork Orange is one of my all-time favorites.I am not a big fan of 20001, but love Dr Strangelove, and even one of the few people that appreciated Eyes Wide Shut.The story is narrated by Malcom McDowell as a young thug who him and his cronies like to terrorize, mug, rape, and abuse people for their sadistic entertainment.One of Alex's rape victim dies and he is put in jail.Alex volunteers for a 'brainwashing' experiment which will have him back in society in no time.The brainwashing requires his eyes to be help open by metal pins and for him to watch constant violence while being given drugs to be make him ill. The operant conditioning works and Alex is not capable of harming his fellow man.However, once he is released from Prsion, many people including his only cronies do harm Alex who is defenseless to protect himself.The movies asks the question 'What measures are considered moral in order to make society safe.' The movie has done a great job of turning Alex into a hate villain from the first Act into a sympathetic character that people can relate to by the third act.The leaves out the last chapter of the book and shows that Alex has reverted back to his old self after bring tortured by his previous victims and pals. In the book, the final chapter showed him becoming a productive member of society. I like the ending of the movie better because it is a bit more cynical and basically shows that you cannot change what person is inside.The movie is loaded with Sex and Violence but nothing to the point of artless garbage such as Hostel. This movie was made for adults and for people who want to think about the theme's presented.The movie was filmed in an a not often used 1.66 to 1 ratio and objects in the center of the picture look perfect while objects on the edges look distorted. This is a interesting technique used by Kubrick.I will admit the one part I don't understand is that Alex's mother has a different hair color in every scene of the movie. She has orange hair, green hair, blonde hair, etc. It is not critical to the plot but there must me something I am is-sing on that part.This is one of two movies (out of 1000s) that I have rated 10/10.Dean",10,1,3,26 October 2006
Rocky III," Favorite Rocky Film? YES Best:? NO
","Do NOT read this review if you have not seen Rocky III. This is more for people who are considering re watching it after many years.I don't think many people will argue that the original Rocky was the best made movie of the series. Keep in mind I have not seen Rocky Balboa yet so I am basing my opinion on Rocky 1 - 5.I don't even care much for Sly but his role in Rocky I was perfect for him as he was completely believable as the semi bum Italian boxer who was tougher tan nails in the ring.Rocky II was the movie everyone wanted because they wanted to see Rocky not just survive but WIN the championship.Rocky III has the most entertainment value to me because we already know the characters, we know the love story, we know Apollo Creed, Pauly, and Mickey.Rocky gets soft fighting has beens for easy money and starts to get a big head.Mr T making his first appearance on the big screen played the role of the young hungry fighter perfectly IMO. He was strong, vicious, fought dirty, and wanted the championship more than anything else on earth. Rocky had sense lost the desire.Micky tell Rocky he wont be a part of this fight because 'This guy will knock you into tomorrow' as only the great Burgess Meredith could say it.Rocky prepares lightly for the first fight with the mighty Clubber Lang and Mickey dies during the first fight after a mêlée ensues before the fight between the Rocky and Clubber Lang Camps.Rocky gets destroyed by Clubber.Rocky is depressed, feels like he has lost his meaning in life, and sees no hope. Apollo Creed comes to the rescue with the famous 'Eye of the Tiger' speech and the popular pop song is played during the movie in place of the 'working hard' to make it more distinctly feel like an 80s movie as compared to its predecessors.As I am sure you know, Rocky wears Clubber Lang down in the rematch and knocks him out in the third round.The reason this is my favorite is the combination of the fact that I already liked the characters, Apollo's character is expanded on, and this movie is almost all action. It starts off with scenes from the Rocky II Apollo Creed rematch and then goes to scenes of him fighting lesser fighters. In between it switches to Clubber Lang knocking out fighters in a much more vicious manner and moving up the ranks. Rocky III even throws ins a charity match between Rocky and Hulk Hogan as an exhibition between a wrestler and a boxer. After Apollo and Adrian (Yo Adrian) gets Rocky of of his funk, it quickly goes through Rocky getting the eye of the tiger back and then quickly moves to the rematch with Clubber Lang. I don't think there was anyone who saw this movie who had any doubt he would lose the rematch.The ensuing Rocky IV and V were very bad especially 5. I recommend Rocky III as great fun one night for another viewing on DVD of course.At this point, the initial reviews for Rocky Balboa (Rocky 6) are looking positive. I laughed when I heard it was made but I am know looking forward to hopefully the final chapter in the Rocky Saga.",8,5,5,16 December 2006
The Witch," There is nothing new to see here
","The trailer did an excellent job of making this look creepy. Unfortunately, the movie did not have a scary moment or much interesting happen at all.The ending seems clichéd, the acting was OK but nothing special, and I could have sworn I have a saw a movie from the 70s that had the same plot and identical ending.I you really are a hardcore fan of horror movies, I would skip this one or wait until it is on Netflix.I am shocked by the 6.6 rating it currently has. This feels like a movie that should have around a 4.5 rating.I don't mind that the movie was slow paced but you have to make the slow pace count with an occasional creepy scene, something that makes the audience uncomfortable or something.I give it a 3 out of 10 and feel like they should have rated this PG-13 as it is only barely R and there is absolutely nothing even slightly scary. The trailer was 100 times better than this stinker.",3,1,4,21 June 2016
Casino Royale," Why all the accolades?
","I have to tell you that when this was being made, I didn't expect much other than a standard bond movie which had ditched the subplots and was nothing more than a 90 minute action movie. I was pleasantly surprised when the initial reviews came out and it had a 2 + hour running time and subplots.I cannot believe I saw the same movie that people are giving a 8.1/10 as of current.I found the new Bond to be very boring and rougher around the edges. I don't mind the rougher around the edges part but I think people have forgot what made bond MOVIES so good -- he was what every man wanted to be. He was a secret agent that always found a way to get out of danger, always got multiple women, and while completely over the top -- at some level every man would want to be James Bond.I realize this is a reboot but not Q or R, no Shaken not Stirred, no good car chases, a lame opening, and lack of a real super villain? Come on, Bond movies never relied on realism.Obviously this film is doing well so they do need my input but for the record, I would get someone more suave to play Bond with a dark side but with a sense of humor. Both Connery and Moore had the sense of humor to add to the fun. Lets face it, some of the best parts of the movie was Q or R showing the new gadgets off. Bonds gadget of choice on this outing -- a freaking cellphone.I do like the fact that they had the subplots but the stakes weren't high enough to make them interesting.I also never minded the campiness of the super genius villains. Yes, Austin Powers had a blast making fun of this but they were paying homage to it because it was classic movie making.Everything in life is subjective and maybe the plot wasn't that interesting to me. Bond and Texas Holdem just seemed stupid. British Intelligence certainly has gone downhill if they cant find a better way to get the money than Bond winning at high stakes poker.I hope they bring out the go for broke over the top villain in the next movie who is hell bent on ruling the world through mass destruction. I don't care if he in a wheelchair or a psychopath who wears a cape. There has to be a mix in there that appeals to the old bond fanatics and the younger generation.Also, it didn't feel like a Bond movie. There was something else missing that I cant quite put my finger on.Heck, I even liked Timothy Dalton as Bond. I liked the Rogue agent bit to revenge his friends death.Also, please have some sort of great opening sequence. Almost all Bond movies have a great opening sequence to quickly draw the crowd into the movie.I gave this one a 5/10 but according to IMDb, I guess most people like it a lot more than me.",7,8,12,28 November 2006
Live Free or Die Hard," Mindless Summer Movie going though the motions
","I was disappointed that Len Wiseman was the director as I did not like the Underworld movies. I didn't think much of Justin Long as the computer hacker sidekick.However, this movie got great reviews (8.9 at the time of the writing and almost 80% at Rottentomatoes) so I gave it a shot.This was a big mistake. The original Die Hard movies were great (not so much 2) because they were character driven action movies which were intense, over the top, and fun.LFODH is flat out boring. Bruce Willis only showed up in body. He he old, calm, and appears bored. Justin Long is unconvincing as the computer hacker.The action consists of dumb downed PG-13 explosions which most have already been seen in the trailers.I also saw 1408 lately which is a good example of PG-13 being intense and designed for adults while still have a friendly rating so the studio can make mega bucks. LFODH was obviously designed to be PG-13 from day 1 as John McClane is not John McClane. He is just an old guy that seems bored and doesn't cuss, doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, etc.However, I was hoping that besides the PC kid friendly rating that LFODH would be exciting and dumb popcorn fun. It was no where close. It was just PC and designed for complete morons.As a standalone movie, LFOD would get an 4. As a Die Hard Sequel, the movie gets an 1.My best advice is to rent or purchase Die Hard or Die Hard 3 and skip this one. Go see 1408 if you want a good PG-13 movie or wait for Transformers.Unfortunately, people will have to see this movie to believe how bad it is.",1,23,49,30 June 2007
Deadpool," Just non stop jokes that mainly fall flat (NO Spoilers)
","First off, I do not read comics so I do not know the source material, I am not a fan-boy of Marvel or DC I just want to see entertaining movies, I may be in the minority at least during it's first week of being in theaters but I wanted to write a review to warn others what Deadpool is like.The movie is honestly a nonstop exercise in profanity with a lot of sex jokes and masturbation jokes especially. I am fine with low brow humor when it is funny. The writers just seem to have Reynolds throw out as many wisecracks as possible and hope that some are funny. I think anyone over 30 will be bored with the jokes. There is nothing that offends me from hearing all these jokes but rather bores me because the lack of humor. It is very much like having to listen to some teen kids try to show off by using non stop profanity only to realize they are just making themselves look dumb.The plot is nothing more than a simple background (origins) story and it is run of the mill. The movie has a lot of violence but nothing creative. The movie is very similar to Super and the Kick Ass movies. However, those movies were superior to Deadpool on every level IMO. The movie also reminds me of the Vacation remake. The 2015 remake of vacation was pretty much one raunchy joke after another but they are not funny.This movie may just be better for younger audiences but I still feel the 30 and up demographics are not going to find this to be a very good movies unless they are a fan of the source material.I give it a 2 out of 10. It gets an 2 instead of 1 only because Morena Baccarin was a side character. She did the best she could with the limited material.Dean",2,219,458,16 February 2016
Dodgeball," Rip Torn steals the show
","First off let me say I am not much of a fan of Ben Stiller but his role was actually funny in this movie.Vince Vaugn does a competent job as the owner of Average Joe's Gym and the cast of misfits were well played.Rip Torn absolutely steals the show with his hilarious antics as the dodge ball coach. 'If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball' while he throws wrenches at the team.Yes the movie is dumb and mainly slapstick humor but it is slapstick humor that is actually funny! This is an excellent comedy that only strives for laughs. This is funniest movie made in a long time.If you even mildly are interested in movie then you are probably going to find it funny.",7,1,2,12 January 2007
