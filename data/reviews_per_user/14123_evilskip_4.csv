The Blair Witch Project," Too much hype;too little payoff
","We all know what this movie is about unless you've been taking a dirt nap for the past 4 months.There is no need to do a synopsis for it.I know that a majority of the movie goers out there just love this movie and it is their favorite all time thriller.I really looked forward to this and was hoping for some good old fashioned scares and goosebumps.Sorry kids, but this movie just doesn't live up to the hype.The only major scare I had was the fear of losing my lunch due to the jerky camerawork.Being severly disappointed doesn't start to describe it.The movie did have its share of creepy moments.No denying that but creepy doesn't translate into scary.(I'm too old to be a slasher/gore fan so the lack thereof isn't an excuse for not liking this film.In fact that is exactly why I wanted to see this).The late night discoveries and the daylight stick figure area were a bit spooky.So was the surprise dental work outside the tent.The ending almost saved the film with its out and out lose your mind intensity.Finally we get something that is close to being really scary.We could have used a lot more of that screaming descent into hell.The payoff to the film was ruined because the first hour was tedious to sit through.Major fear number two was that I would nod off.But the 3 characters screaming at each other were so irritating it forced you to stay awake.These 3 are such morons that I hoped something WOULD come out of the woods and put them out of my misery.Die already!! Who cares about a bunch of whining morons arguing about cigarettes a lack of supplies and an 'are we there yet?'mentality?The absurdity with the map had me lose any connection with the characters.Stop screaming at each other! Beat the moron to death with tree limbs and get the $#^# out of there!The heralded 'finding the lost documentary film' is nothing new. Cannibal Holocaust served up that angle more than 20 years ago.At least it wasn't as jerky.Sorry but I was rooting for the evil varmint in the woods. Great ending and a nice try but it doesn't save the film.Give it a 2.",Null,0,1,13 August 1999
Ed Wood," Eternal optimist in an angora sweater
",This is a very well done film about a very strange man and his even stranger entourage.Ed Wood made up for in optimism what he lacked in talent.To say he was a hack film screenwriter/director is being kind.He had no talent and didn't know it. But he never gave up. Burton's film follows Wood from his first film to his cinematic 'masterpiece ' Plan 9 From Outer Space'.Martin Landau gives a deserved Oscar winning turn as the drug addicted washed up Bela Lugosi.No doubt great many liberties were taken with Lugosi such as his extreme bitterness toward Boris Karloff.Also the scene where Lugosi is wrestling with the octopus in the middle of the night is pure dramatic license.(Watch Bride Of The Monster and you can tell that isn't Bela. The cast is wonderful and this is a film to catch by all means.,8,0,0,11 March 2000
The Sixth Sense," The best movie of 1999 hands down!
","If there is any justice in the sordid political world of Hollywood,this film should garner quite a few Oscar nominations. After seeing 'Blair Witch' one day we saw 'Sixth Sense'the next day. Folks, the wrong movie has been getting all the hype/buzz. Seeing the ads you know that a 9 year old boy sees dead people and a child psychologist is brought in to help him.Slowly you begin to discover the truth revolving around everyone.When the boy tells Willis that his secret is he sees dead people you get a bit chilled. When asked how often he replies in a very scared voice'All the time'.That turns your blood to ice.(Almost made me drop some skippy chips).Even though you see what he sees it isn't until he says that do you feel yourself going over the edge.
 I have to admit that about halfway through the movie I figured out where this was leading to. However I was only half right. Knowing this did NOT diminish the experience.It even pulled me deeper into the film.Every little nuance in the film deserved your attention.It was a kick to see the audience reaction near the end of the film.They were blown away by it. It would be hard enough to have the visions the 9 year old has even as an adult.Haley John Osment crawls into the child's skin and is utterly fantastic!You believe him.He pulls you along for the very tortured hell ride this child is on.Willis gives an outstanding understated performance as well.He's the decent man that really wants to help the child even when he has doubts about himself. The writing & directing by M.Night is excellent.He conjures up images you won't soon forget.This gets a very rare 10. If I could only give it an 11....",10,0,0,25 August 1999
The Matrix," One of the all time best sci-fi movies
",What if your 'reality' wasn't real at all?What if your 'life' was a computer program fed into your by evil artficial intelligence that was using you as a power source? Welcome to the future. A group of rebels separated from the computers fight for the freedom of an enslaved mankind.A prophetess declares that Neo(Reeves) is the one to lead them out of the darkness.The rebels risk their lives to bring him out of his force fed life into the real world. The special effects are outstanding and the plot is riveting. This has to be one of the most original and well thought out movies in the past 30 years.2001 can't even stand in the shadow of this gem. My only regret is that I didn't get to see it on the big screen and I'm kicking myself for this.Go rent it and prepare to be amazed.A rare solid 10.,10,0,0,27 September 1999
