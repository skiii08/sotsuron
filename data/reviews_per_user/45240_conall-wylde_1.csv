Marie Antoinette," Why did I vote so low
","Well... The music of this movie is just plain wrong. You just cannot show the court of Versailles featuring queen Marie-Antoinette and salt the thing with electric guitar, it's not only out of place, it's also insufferable and that's a shame, because if it wasn't for the music this movie could be a real great one, it has a very good photography, the actors are good, but unfortunately none of this manage to counteract the fact that you don't use electric music with a film like this one. It doesn't make it 'modern', it just make it indigestible. I think that the story could be more interesting too, because if we get the feel of how boring it was to live in this golden cage, it's very possible to end thinking that the movie itself is boring... It's a nice painting, maybe, but it's certainly not a masterpiece, IMHO.",1,2,5,12 February 2007
