Black Swan," Low Entertainment Value
","I was unlucky enough to take a chance on this movie. The good is that Natalie Portman gives an Oscar worthy performance. The bad is that this movie is so intense it is frequently painful to watch. I've even heard some who think it should be classified as a horror movie. As independent film buffs, my wife and I see a lot of films that are not intended for a wide audience. Fortunately, many are excellent. Although this film was very well made and had excellent direction, it has very low entertainment value. The one high point of the movie was near the end when Natalie performs as the Black Swan. But this is not worth the price of admission. As is sometimes the case, movies that don't entertain get very high critical reviews. What is surprising to me is that user's gave this movie such a high score. Sometimes, when this happens, I like to see the movie again when it comes out on DVD or cable to see if I was out in left field when I saw it in the theaters. I hated the final Bourne movie in the theaters but found it much more enjoyable on cable. Go figure.",7,3,14,4 December 2010
Ted," Pathetic and Not Worth Wasting Your Time
","Seeing over 100 movies in the theaters each year, I speak with some knowledge of the quality of the films offered. There are excellent films like the Hurt Locker, Midnight in Paris, and A Separation. There are some very good films like the first Hangover, Bridesmaids, X-Men First Class, the Fighter, Warrior, and the first Iron Man movie. There are even many good films rated from 5 to 7 on the IMDb scale. But there are also many tankers, like Jack and Jill or the current film I am reviewing, TED.I went to see it Friday afternoon because I thought I would like it. It's hard to gross me out and I really like Mark Wahlberg. When the gross out and the use of the f-word are totally gratuitous and not funny, and the story stinks, there is absolutely nothing to recommend.I see the movie did well at the box office. I hope word of mouth will keep you from wasting your time. The movie is a total looser and you who read this review have been for-warned.",1,20,44,2 July 2012
Brokeback Mountain," Failed to Meet Our Expectations
","With all the hype, I was not anxious to see this movie because I felt I knew what it would be like. As a liberal, I was not offended in any way by the movie. However, I found the movie to be very slow moving and too long, as well as short on entertainment value. I had recently seen Match Point and The Squid and the Whale and found them to be extremely well acted and much more enjoyable.The acting was uniformly good, but I expect that in a high caliber movie. The real plus of the movie is the Director was able to convey extremely well the emotional turmoil that the characters felt. However, there is a lot to endure to reach that end.I hope I don't sit back and see this movie take a lot of awards because it was so hyped by the critics. I haven't seen Munich yet, but of the movies I have seen this year, there are a number that I liked much better, including the aforementioned, and Crash, I Walk the Line, and Hustle and Flow.If you have to see all the movies that will be nominated for best picture, you'll probably have to see this one. If not, skip it.",6,9,31,12 January 2006
Shutter Island," Valentine's Day Can't Be Worse Than This
","I have to comment on this film since I was so disappointed in it. When I read the review this morning in the paper, I was sure I was going to skip it (the critic in the Washington Post panned it). However, later in the day I noticed on IMDb that it had a rating of 8.5, the same as Avatar, so I began to wonder if it might be good. I went to Metacritic and found it had a generally favorable score of 63, so I decided to see it. I could have gone to see Valentine's Day, which my friend had described as not as bad as he thought it would be.Close to two slow hours are spent in developing the story that had a very convoluted and unsatisfying conclusion. There was very little entertainment value in this movie, although the acting was generally good. The critic in the Post called the movie weird and I would have to agree. I would say that, if the story was better and the conclusion more satisfying, my rating would have been higher, although I would still not recommend this movie.",4,9,18,19 February 2010
Lost in Translation," Very overrated and boring
","Sometimes the critics get it entirely wrong.  With a 95% fresh tomato and over 8 rating on IMDB, I was sure my wife and I were in for a real treat. In addition, I like Bill Murray very much.  Believe me this film is a complete waste of time.  There are a few laughs in the first part and my wife enjoyed the view of Tokyo since she had never been there.  But, there's not much more.  The acting was fine but the film had very, very little entertainment value.  We go to the movies about once every other week and see a lot of movies.  I also see a lot of movies with my granddaughters. Pirates of the Caribbean was a masterpiece compared to this movie.  Let the critics see this movie and go to see something you will enjoy.",3,3,7,25 September 2003
Bridesmaids," The most laughs of any film in recent memory
","I can't say enough good things about this film. My wife and I were laughing out loud almost continuously throughout the entire film. I never realized from Saturday Night Live what an enormous talent Kristen Wiig is. The supporting cast is also excellent, especially Maya Rudolph, Melissa McCarthy, Rose Byrne, and Chris O'Dowd. The supporting actress who really stole a lot of our attention was Melissa McCarthy (Molly from TV's Mike and Molly). Her performance was completely uninhibited and frequently, fall in the aisle, hilarious. However, the scene outside the bridal shop with Maya Rudolph will be the one you will long remember after the movie is over.This is not a chick flick although it does star very talented women and the men, except of Chris O'Dowd, are mostly secondary. If this film is not an enormous hit, it will be because of men who refuse to see it. For those men who can enjoy a movie that doesn't include over the top action, you will be rewarded for seeing this film.My wife and I enjoyed Hangover very much and this film will be compared to it. Some time has past since we saw it so it may be unfair to compare it with this film that is so clear in our minds. However, we both think this movie is even better than Hangover. If you're not a prude, we strongly recommend you seeing this movie.",9,9,19,14 May 2011
Inception," Couldn't Be More Disappointed
","My wife and I went to this movie with high expectations. Unfortunately, I relied too heavily on the critics and IMDb's rating. The acting was good which would normally mean a higher rating, but I disliked this movie so much, I couldn't give it higher than one star.The theory of the movie is complicated and, I believe, not well explained. By the end, which I thought would never come, I felt I understood the basics but not much more (maybe my wife and I are just to dumb to grasp the intricacies).Some of the special effects were excellent, but for the most part they went on way to long. A good editing job could have eliminate enough to get the film below 2 hours. Many of the action scenes in the snow could have been eliminated altogetherMy wife and I are retired and go to a lot of movies. We thoroughly enjoyed Knight and Day which has only grossed $70 million but avoided like the plague the newer movie Grown Ups which has already grossed over $130 million. It's unfortunate, but stupid is in.When you see so many movies like we do your requirements may be higher. I want a reasonably good story, good acting, and a entertaining experience. We loved Hangover, Kick-Ass, and Toy Story 3. There was quality and entertainment in each. Except for the special effects, I can't say the same about Inception.",1,22,61,21 July 2010
WALLÂ·E," Very Disappointing
","I don't know if I would have liked this movie better if my expectations weren't so high.I agree with those critics who say the first half hour, which contained so little dialogue, was excellent. However, in the remainder of the movie, the animation got in the way of the story. The animation was stunning, but it was also distracting. In Ratatouille and Toy Story 2, the story drove the movie, and although the animation was great, it wasn't so overwhelming that it interfered.I recently took my granddaughter to see Kung Fu Panda, which was not as well animated but overall was much more enjoyable. The greatness of the animation can detract from the greatness of the movie.",7,11,23,2 July 2008
Inside Llewyn Davis," If you are a professional critic, you will probably love it, if not, there is a good chance you will hate it
","I love many of the Coen Brothers movies including Fargo, No Country for Old Men and A Serious Man. They all look like masterpieces compared to this movie. I go to a movie to be entertained and this movie, except for the songs, had almost no entertainment value. If a movie has both a bad story and bad acting, it generally gets bad reviews from the professional critics and nobody goes to see it. If a movie has a bad story but good acting it might get good reviews for the acting, which for many professional reviewers overshadows the need for a good story and entertainment value. To me there is almost no story, except to portray a person devoid of common sense who continues to pursue a dream of becoming a singer while his experiences say that dream is nothing more than a dream. Even when he appears to be heading for a real job as a seaman, his past mistakes in judgment make that very difficult to achieve. Thinking ahead is not part of his mentality.I strongly recommend skipping this movie. Look on Metacritic.com for the user reviews. Currently they are 13 positive, 11 mixed, and 13 negative. But the critic's rating is 92 out of 100. In this case the users were much wiser than the critics. If you want to see a good character study movie, with both a good story and excellent acting, go to see Nebraska. I am no fan of Bruce Dern, but he is outstanding in this movie and you will get your money's worth.",5,8,15,7 January 2014
