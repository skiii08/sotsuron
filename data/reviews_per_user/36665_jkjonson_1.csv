Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The real menace was the director. And no phantom, he.
","I've been waiting for the next installment in the Star Wars saga since I graduated high school in 1983. In fact, the opening day of 'Return of the Jedi' was my graduation night, and I went to see it after the ceremony. I got the movies when they came out on video, and even have the laser disc boxed set of the 'improved' versions of the original three movies. I've always loved Star Wars, and I am a big fan of science fiction films in general.I'm sorry to report that 'Star Wars: The Phantom Menace' is a HUGE disappointment. Certainly the special effects are awe-inspiring, and there are a few scenes which provoke smiles or open-mouthed awe, such as the pod race. But there is so much more that is either only mildly interesting or downright boring that I found myself shaking my head or rolling my eyes even before the curtain came down.Prequels always suffer from the fact that the audience already knows more or less how things are going to turn out. We know that Obi Wan can't possibly die until Episode IV. We know that Anakin Skywalker turns into mean old Darth Vader somewhere along the line. We know that Senator Palpatine is pretending to be a nice old man when in reality he's consorting with the Dark Side. We know a LOT about what's going to happen before it happens. Prequels, therefore, cannot be primarily plot-driven, because plot-driven tories are dependent on the gradual and methodical revealing of the outcome of the film. Prequels need to depend on other mechanisms for entertaining the audience. The best way to do this is through character development. If the characters are solidly drawn, and engender some degree of empathy in the audience, their trials and tribulations will inspire concern and interest, regardless of the outcome.Sadly, almost without exception, the characters in The Phantom Menace are mere silhouettes. There is no depth to them. I don't blame this on the actors. Liam Neeson can turn in powerful, red-blooded performances like those in 'Michael Collins' or 'Rob Roy.' He can also be as wooden as a two-by-four, as witness his Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn. His character does almost nothing to inspire any real degree of interest, much less empathy. Obi-Wan Kenobi, played competently by Ewan McGregor, is just a sidekick in this film, walking alongside his master and doing his bidding willingly, creating almost no conflict at all. Jake Lloyd's Anakin Skywalker is such a cute little poppet it's hard to imagine how he will transmute into the sinister Darth Vader, the rubbery Yoda's complaints about how danger there is from him to the contrary. Natalie Portman's Queen Amidala wears a lot of exotic costumes, but does very little to convince me that her character is more than window-dressing.George Lucas makes the mistake of focusing instead on the plot, which, as a prequel, is already pretty much a foregone conclusion. Nevertheless, by neglecting character development in favor of elaborate effects and plot devices, Lucas actually manages to make the story rather boring. There are long periods when nothing much happens, and the brief action scenes are all too brief. There is little tension developed, primarily because it is difficult to give a damn about any of the characters.There is one character, however, who inspired extremely passionate feelings in me: Jar-Jar Binks. Jar-Jar is the single most annoying character in all of science fiction film history. You truly have to see this film if only to have the experience of feeling such abject hatred for a character who is ostensibly on the Good Guy's team. I won't go into more detail in this review, but it is my greatest hope that at the beginning of Episode II, Jar-Jar is quickly sucked into the intake of the nearest air-breathing spaceship engine and turned into a greasy black plume of smoke.I would recommend seeing this film once so that you can enjoy the wonderful art direction and cinematography and computer special effects, but that's almost all that's enjoyable about this dreary, boring film about dreary, boring people.",Null,0,1,21 May 1999
