Requiem for a Dream," Nonsensical feel-bad move
","I was thinking a lot about this movie after having watched it. some people say this is what a good movie has to be like. well, I don't.this movie is completely nonsensical. honestly, every single action, even the introduction makes no sense at all if you think just a little bit about it.this movie is not about drugs. because its to stupid to be able to show you what drugs actually do. the only goal of this movie is to make its viewer feel bad. and it succeeds greatly in this. thus my 2 points out of 10.there are two possible reasons for the rating on IMDb:1) I guess there are lots of people who just want to feel bad. I can come over and slap you in the face to make you feel even worse.2) its all just a prank, like the 'adobe air' prank in the google play store for androidtwo small examples of the nonsense:a) introduction: son (who his mother is afraid of in the beginning but happy as f* to see him next time she sees him) steals mothers television to sell it. mother knows exactly where he will sell it (it is always the same dealer miles away, as the son is doing this regularly) and gets there to buy it back. --> think a little bit about this. the whole setting is stupid.b) end: the two boys get in Jail for, well, taking drugs and having the intention to buy more. nothing more. I'm not from the states, but I think having taken drugs and wanting to buy drugs is not a reason to be put in Jail (without a trail and while dying from an injury of course, as this has to be as realistic as possible)well and everything that happens in between is nonsensical as well.",3,2,3,27 October 2013
