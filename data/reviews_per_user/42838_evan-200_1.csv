The Hangover," This Was Supposed to Be Funny?
","I didn't have very high expectations just because these kind of made-for-fraternity movies aren't usually appealing to me. In that regard it was what I expected. Not clever at all, there really weren't any jokes. I mean you pretty much know that the movie is going to be about a terrible hangover, and it is - but there aren't any very clever jokes, solid characters, or interesting situations where something funny might happen. Instead, the writers take the easy route (but not a very funny one) and all of the attempted humor is just pure shock-value. It just doesn't meet my definition for what a good comedy or good movie should be at all. I kept waiting to laugh, but never did. I would not recommend this film to anyone. It's all hype and marketing and does not deliver.",1,35,71,7 October 2009
