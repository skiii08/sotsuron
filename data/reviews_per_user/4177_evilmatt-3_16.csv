The Ring," The best horror film to come along in years
","After enduring horror film after horror film from the 90's that paraded senseless violence and vacuous plots, I was severely concerned about the health of the genre.  From the late 90's until today, it's been even worse: we have films like _The Sixth Sense_ and _Frailty_ which purport to be intelligent but are little more than cheap cinematic jack-in-the-boxes that shout 'Boo!' at the end.  Keeping that in mind, my standards for a horror film these days have been correspondingly low.  Now, along comes _The Ring_, and all that is blown away.Not only does this film have a fantastic story (for once, EVER, we have a ghost story that EXPLAINS the ghost's activity), but the acting is first rate.  The casting of Watts, whose intensity was integral to the success of _Mullholland Drive_, is nothing short of genius.  Such talent in a horror film is risky, but pays off in the emotional punch and urgency of Watt's performance.And of course, this movie would be almost laughable without the right look. Every person involved with the visuals audio here took the utmost care to get it in sync with the emotional tone of the film.  The result is that unlike _Rosemary's Baby_ or similar films, you never get a break from the mounting tension and sense of doom surrounding Rachel Keller.  Very effective.This should be a lesson to everyone involved with _Scream_, _The Sixth Sense_, _Frailty_, _I Know What You Did Last Summer_, and all that other crap: WE ARE ADULTS IN THE AUDIENCE.  WE CAN HANDLE IT IF YOU MAKE A FILM THAT IS ARTFUL AND REQUIRES THOUGHT.  Of course, this one has a surprising ending too, but (horror of horrors) it actually makes sense and clears up some earlier ambiguities in the movie that the movie goer had thought resolved (which, Mr. M. Night, is how surprise endings are supposed to work.)If you like scary movies, this is a must-see.  One thing though: don't go to the theater and then scream like a little girl every time something scary happens.  Being an adult, you can control your reactions, and it's very annoying to the rest of us that have to listen to you.",9,0,0,13 October 2002
The Others," A fantastic ghost story
","This is a return to an old tradition in the horror genre: the haunted house film.  Many would argue that this particular subgenre has already been revived by such films as _The Sixth Sense_ and _What Lies Beneath_, but I would reply that this movie, with its excellent writing, acting, and mise-en-scene, shows just how silly and amateur those other films really are.One of the main attraction of this film is Nicole Kidman, and that is rightfully so.  She is as brilliant in the film as she was in _Eyes Wide Shut_ (perhaps more so) as a mother who is at once religiously fanatic and deeply compassionate towards her children.  It is this sort of moral ambiguity that makes this film so delightful and fulfilling throughout.The visual effects in the movie, although subtle, are nothing short of amazing.  The foggy landscape around the house and the dark, moody tone of the entire film set a tone in which the scares seem perfectly in step with the rest of the movie, as well as the emotions of the central characters.Last but not least, the script is one of the best I've seen in a long time. It maintains a careful pace (neither too slow or fast- a pitfall that claims many haunted house films) while slowly building to an unforgettable and logically sound conclusion (which seems to be less and less valued in big studio films these days, although it is an element with importance that cannot be estimated.)All in all, this is terrific filmmaking.  Here's hoping we see more horror films of this caliber soon.",9,1,2,11 August 2001
Corpse Bride," An interesting and relevant, if not perplexing, morality tale
","Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is by no means a bad movie- indeed, it is much better than most schlock these days- but it is part of a growing category of films with a very specific problem. It does not seem to have a specific audience in mind, or if it does, it is not approaching that audience in the proper way.Most people will see this film because it is to all appearances the follow-up to The Nightmare Before Christmas. Visually, this is true- Corpse Bride looks and feels very similar to the older film, although computer animation makes this one look even better.However, whereas The Nightmare Before Christmas maintained a jovial, family friendly theme and plot (complete with misunderstood heroes and dastardly villains), Corpse Bride gives us a quiet little story about three young adults who find themselves in an impossible moral situation. Promises are made which must be kept, and out of three people, one must inevitably end up heartbroken. The three central characters are all exceedingly likable- although one may believe Emily is to be the villain of the piece, she consistently demonstrates as much humanity as anyone.Ultimately, the film is about one very difficult moral choice that has to be made by one of the characters. The choice is made and the movie ends, but unless you're paying really close attention, it's difficult to understand why the characters act as they do, and why the film has the ending that it does. While not giving anything away, I'll say that in this sense, the third act of the film presents a very mature dilemma that children (and many adults) are not going to appreciate.Of course, the frustrating thing about this movie is that so much time is spent on song and dance numbers that the moral and romantic elements never really get fleshed out. As such the film (like Victor) is stuck between two worlds, and never really makes up its mind where it wants to be. On this point, then, it fails.It's probably still worth watching, although Tim Burton has done much better in the past.",6,5,9,24 September 2005
The Village," Are you serious?
","I'm feeling generous today.  M. Night Shyamalan gets a 3/10 from me because this movie had some decent visuals and a neat beginning concept. Everything- EVERYTHING- else about this movie is terrible.The story has been beaten to death so many times elsewhere that for me to do it yet again here would just be cruelty.  Suffice to it say that the plot of this film is neither suspenseful nor well-written.  Unlike M. Night's earlier transgressions, this one is almost devoid of ALL interesting moments including the patented M. Night Shyamalan Cheap Sound Effects Scare (tm). As I sat there for what seemed like eternity, I was practically bored to tears on several occasions.The acting.  The acting.  The acting.  I have the idea that M. Night thinks it's funny to collect a superb cast and then give them all a terrible script and worse stage direction so that everybody not only turns in the worst performance of their careers, but sound like they are rehearsing a high school play.  I honestly thought for the first half of the movie, 'No, surely the acting cannot be *this* bad by default.  He must be doing it on purpose.'  However, the jilted line delivery, wooden acting, and transparent facades of emotion from such cinematic greats as Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt (and promising newcomers such as Bryce Dallas Howard) continued unabated throughout the entire film.  This is the most painful part of the film, and perhaps M. Night's worst offense yet to American cinema.Because the acting is so terrible, any emotional effect whatsoever that would have been present in the movie is drained.  I simply didn't care whether anyone lived or died, and frankly thought the 'creatures' were the most interesting thing to look at (if one can properly say that- I won't spoil it here, but suffice it to say that if you go to this movie expecting an in depth exploration of the supernatural, you are going to be angry.)M. Night's latest trend is to include at least one thing in his movie so idiotic that he completely insults even the most basic audience member's intelligence.  Here, he manages to offend through the character of Ivy (to say she was played ineptly by Howard is to be luxuriously kind to both Howard and Shyamalan), who although blind, manages to run though field, woods, and houses without much trouble, can instantly locate any item she needs, looks people in the eyes when talking to them, and can 'see colors' despite he blindness.  In some scenes, Howard even appear to have forgotten that her character is blind.Shyamalan: Are you serious?  Am I actually to believe that this was a serious attempt at an adult film (let alone a thriller?)  after Signs, I simply called you a bad film maker.  Now, I'm beginning to wonder whether you might actually be mildly retarded.  I hope you're not serious.",3,1,2,1 August 2004
Mulholland Drive," I couldn't take my eyes off it
","I had the misfortune of REALLY having to go to the bathroom about halfway through this movie.  It was unfortunate because there was just no way I could stop watching _Mulholland Drive_.  This is Lynch at the top of his game: subtle, engaging, and creepy as hell.  Lynch's latest is pure joy to watch and listen to; the tension is almost too thick to breathe in some places.  The dialogue is the best I've seen in a Lynch film: well-paced and meaningful throughout.Narratively and thematically, this movie is very typically Lynch.  It is very reminiscent of _Lost Highway_, but better done and definitely scarier. In fact, just about everything in this movie contributes to a sick discomfort that refuses to let go, until, finally, the audience is allowed to comprehend the illusion when the credits roll.Excellent.  I hope they at least release THIS ONE on DVD.",9,7,12,13 October 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," An exceedingly complex film that demands multiple viewings
","Anyone familiar with Kubrick knows going in what to expect: a surreal world in which characters interact in what on the surface seem to be inconsequential ways, while beneath the surface other conflicts and storylines rage and churn. So it is: it seemed to me that although in the strictest sense nothing really happens in this film, the conflict and tension are greater than almost any other film I've seen.Kubrick has this way of expanding the film experience to the viewer, and nowhere is it more apparent than here. We are hit with a barrage of stimuli and expected to piece together the story and thematic elements ourselves. Only a truly masterful film such as this one can attempt such a thing and succeed so well. For example, Kubrick's use of colors (and rainbows of course) to represent emotional states or silence to indicate an inescapable situation are as universal as they are powerful.One really needs to see this film multiple times. By the time you figure out exactly what the film is doing, you've missed enough elements that another viewing is imperative. That's not such a bad thing: the film, with its utterly un-erotic sexuality and numerous subtexts is joy to watch.",9,0,0,17 July 1999
The Matrix Reloaded," The best and worst of the Hollywood mainstream
","This is a very unusual film.  If you pinned me down and forced me to say one way or the the other, I guess I'd have to say I enjoyed it, because I did. However, I also have *serious* problems with this movie, which, oddly enough, are completely different from my problems with the first one.The good:<ul><li>The philosophy of the film is no longer stupid.  The first was amateur at best and was often so grating I felt like the script had been written by 18 year olds overly stimulated by their first philosophy class.  Problem solved here.  This is a much more intelligent film than the first one, with some fairly deep meditations on free will and the social/personal nature of love (although the latter was thrown in almost at the last moment and didn't get the coverage it deserved).  Well done.</li></ul><ul><li>Special effects.  Well, poop.  It's _The Matrix_.  They're awesome.  What did you expect?</li></ul><ul><li>The acting.  Generally better all around, except for our friend Keanu. Fortunately he's either wearing sunglasses or generally not speaking most of the time.  We are spared the unintentional hilarity of another 'I know Kung Fu' moment.  Thank God.</li></ul>The bad (and this is BAD):<ul><li>What the film says about us as a society.  Am I the only one who noticed that this film is telling us there are only two bases for a relationship between human beings: sex and violence.  Think about it!  The only time Neo and Trinity (the 'love story' of the film) are EVER examined with any depth is when a) they're having sex or b) one of them is about to die.</li></ul>No, wait.  It gets worse.Naiobi is not merely a friendly and concerned individual; she's Morpheus' old lover.  Again with sex.  As if that's the only reason you'd help someone.Link, walking into his home after a long deployment, is expecting to see his wife.  The first words out of his mouth, which I won't repeat here, should be offensive to all women and any men who don't like to think of themselves as disgusting sexual stereotypes.Not to mention the nearly 10 minute long Zion dance sequence, which is probably the closest thing to pornography you're going to see in a mainstream film (and I saw this having seen _Irreversible_ earlier this year).  All the cool kids are having sex.  Why?  Because they're cool.*Sound of head banging against keyboard.*Go see it.  You're probably going to anyway.  And it's good.  Just remember what this film is trying to tell you about yourself, and make up your own mind.",7,0,0,24 May 2003
When Harry Met Sally...," One of the best romantic comedies ever
","I don't care whether you like the genre or not; it's impossible to not pay tribute to this film.  It was at the time a fresh idea made into a brilliant script that was executed by top notch actors.  Probably the very best thing about this film is the way it flawlessly incorporates everyday 'real' conversations into the story, without the typical Hollywood melodrama.  It's subtle enough to satisfy those who consider themselves too sophisticated for the genre and romantic enough to satisfy those like myself who for some reason can't seem to get enough.  The final word?  This one is destined to be a classic along the lines of _It Happened One Night._",9,1,1,25 July 2001
The Green Mile," Good, but let's not go overboard
","I must say I was pleasantly surprised by this film.  The acting and story were both much better than I thought they would be.However, I do not really agree with the view that Oscars should immediately rain down upon this for a few reasons.  First, the screenplay, while certainly entertaining, has all the originality of a Disney script.  This is not to say it's bad; I just thought the movie was extremely predictable. In places, it even lapses into cliché.Second, while Tom Hanks and company do a fine job of acting, none of the roles were particularly difficult to play.  All of the characters (with the possible exception of John Coffey) were extremely one dimensional.  Half an hour into the movie I knew how each of them would handle just about any situation-- there was none of that ambiguity or uncertainty that can make a character not just an image but an extension of the audience.Finally, the directing is also good, but not spectacular.  While this movie script may be more challenging than most to shoot well, I think our director again lapsed into clichés with some of the screen shots (for a good example, pick any of the bird's eye view shots with the camera slowly moving up. Apparently the director is fond of these, as he also was liberal with them in The Shawshank Redemption.)Overall, this is a good, entertaining movie, but if you want an Oscar winner, walk over to the next screen and see Being John Malkovich or American Beauty.",7,1,2,12 December 1999
Vanilla Sky," Nicely paced thriller; not exactly original
","Overall, I liked this.  It was pretty intelligent most of the time, despite a tendency to talk down to the audience.  Probably the most notable thing about this film is its unyielding romanticism regarding the universe, which is admirable in any film these days.This film owes a LOT, though, to David Lynch.  The plot structure, characters, and thematics felt like they were all ripped from Lynch's films. Crowe not so subtly pulls in elements from Blue Velvet, Lost Highway, and the recent Mulholland Drive to tell his story.  This naturally puts Crowe in a harsh light, since his use of the elements is not nearly so masterful as Lynch's.  Instead of a stream of consciousness film about the human condition, we have one that paints itself into a corner and then struggles fervently to get out- although it should be noted that the film DOES succeed, the ending only passes the credibility test by the skin of its teeth.That said, this is worth seeing.  Certainly one of the better films to come out lately.",8,0,0,24 December 2001
Signs," Aggressively bad
","That's right. Unlike many bad films, _Signs_ is not content to merely be a lesser example of what we call film-making; it seemed to me that this film was actually trying to hurt me. To say it in the nicest possible way, M. Night Shyamalan is a terrible director. He has no sense of mood or timing, cannot structure a cohesive plot to save his life, and can't scare the audience without resorting to cheap sound effect tricks. The humorous elements, which should be cathartic, instead make the film choppy and unbelievably annoying. The philosophy of the film has all the depth of a puddle and only pays lip service to the idea that films should have some sort of thematic cohesion. This movie fails to be interesting in any way, shape, or form- at least _The Sixth Sense_ kept us engaged before hitting us with an utterly absurd ending.My attempts to articulate just how bad this film is fall fantastically short of conveying the experience. Thus, I have made a list of unpleasant things I would do instead of ever seeing this garbage again. I would:<ul><li>papercut my eyelid - lick soiled toilet paper - eat a bug - be peed on - intentionally place my hand on a hot stove - get a nipple pierced - lick a flagpole in the middle of December</li></ul>Oh yeah, one other thing: after seeing Mr. Shyamalan in a too long dialogue scene with Mel Gibson, I can add insult to injury- he's a bad actor too. Do us all a favor and stop trying to be Alfred Hitchcock, okay?",1,1,2,11 August 2002
Identity," The answer is: Someone who's too smart for mainstream cinema and too stupid for David Lynch
","The question is: What kind of person is going to love _Identity_?The LA Times review says that you would never just be able to guess the ending of this movie.  Well, five minutes in, I guessed it.  I'll be the first to admit that _Identity_ does have potential: a taut psychological thriller based on Christie's _Ten Little Indians_.  Sartre even makes a brief appearance, leading one to hope that this film could give us a meaty existential meditation on the meaning of identity as well a few good scares.Don't get your hopes up.  _Identity_ does all the work for you, requiring zero thought and even less of an attention span.  I actually found myself making the story more interesting as I watched.  The ending, which is supposed to be a plot twist (though I can't see how your average 12 year old couldn't see it coming a mile away, given the structure of the film) just falls flat and left me with an empty kind of 'Is that all?' feeling.  I got the feeling that the writer thought he was being original.  Negative on that, sir: see _Lost Highway_, _Mullholland Drive_, and _Passion of Mind_ for better variations on the final twist.That said, most of the audience did not feel as I did about the film, instead chuckling with amazement as they crooed:'THAT person was the killer?  How wacky and original?'[insert sound of me slapping my forehead- HARD]With all of that in mind, the performances are all really good.  It's nice to see John Cusack getting work.  Ray Liotta does the same role he always does, so you can pretty much take it or leave it.  Alfred Molina once again changes himself completely and leave me wondering what his real accent actually is.The look and misé en scène of this film was fantastic.  Maybe next time we can have a story.So, the only way to really enjoy this film is to be too smart for your average Hollywood fare and too obtuse to see the point that the film is trying to make.  I'm sure there are people like that out there, but I don't care to meet them.",6,0,0,26 April 2003
Amélie," Wordly cynicism be damned
","Many, many people reflect on this film and find it fluffy, cartoonish, and wildly unrealistic.  While the fact that this is mainly an emotional film (as all good films are) necessitates a certain degree of hyperbole, I disagree that it is all that unrealistic and charge that Amelie's detractors are those who are unrealistic.  The simple, undeniable truth of this film IS the only simple, undeniable truth: that of human emotion.  Amelie is a person unable to separate how she feels about the world from how she interacts with it.  This translates into behavior which is often brave, sometimes crazy, and always lovable.  In this sense, then, Amelie is not a superhuman or a saint (for she is also painfully aware of her shortcomings and petty vanities), but a person who has the courage to actually be herself and let her emotions, no matter how fanciful or 'unrealistic' they may be, shape her world and the world of the others around her.  Simply put, every single person could be Amelie if he or she wanted to, except for our cynical and bitter insistence that people like Amelie don't exist.The main conflict, of course, comes when Amelie falters and cannot allow herself to follow through in this fashion in pursuing her own true love. Truly, if ever the dangers of worldly cynicism (or 'realism' as we are fond of calling it these days) have been shown more accurately in a film, I would love to see that film.So, if the above description appeals to you, you will love the film.  If it doesn't, then you need to see it even more- the message is there not for the romantics who believed in this stuff all along, but for the cynics who maintain against all evidence to the contrary that the world is a rational place.",9,2,4,6 January 2002
The Sixth Sense," An ending doesn't make a movie folks!
","The only positive thing I have to say about this film is that it had a nice ending which tied everything together.  Other than that, it had absolutely ZERO plot or character development.  It's obviously Bruce Willis' attempt to break into 'serious' acting...it seems more like his attempt to revive his previous career of pointless movies like Die Hard or its thousand sequels. See it  once for the ending, then burn it.",3,1,2,18 December 1999
Gladiator," What Ever Happened to Baby Comodus?
","You've probably seen this film or you will in the near future regardless of what this review says.  With that established, probably the most fascinating thing about this film is that it plays out almost exactly like _What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?_ for men.  The conflict between Phoenix and Crowe for the approval/authority of the father figure (at least on Phoenix's side) parallels very closely with that of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford in the earlier film.  Seriously.  Watch both of them and then try to say that you can't possibly imagine Phoenix breaking out into that creepy 'I've Written a Letter to Daddy' song.  Ugh.",7,0,0,22 December 2000
Donnie Darko," Beautiful, terrifying
","I think the main theme of this film was summed up somewhere in the middle, where Donnie is speaking to  a not-so-helpful self-help guru and says something to the following effect:'Yes, I am scared and I am confused.  But I think you are the f**king antichrist!!!'In the end, _Donnie Darko_ is a film about people who feel life and all the emotions within it very deeply.  Donnie himself is a basically sweet-tempered (often courageous) young man who is pathologically terrified of loneliness and the thought of spiritual isolation.  His quest for meaning and self-discovery drives him to the fringes of our reality, which only serves to isolate him more from the world he loves.  The few who understand what Donnie is going through go largely unnoticed (such as his girlfriend Gretchen or a tragically overweight yet remarkable sensitive little girl) or unappreciated (such as Karen, the English teacher whose only sin is trying to show her students that there is no such thing as a true end.)Of course, this movie far from polarizes its characters (indeed, polarization is the last thing this film wants to accomplish) and the majority are just a mishmash of the beautiful and the grotesque: Donnie's parents, who are at the same time loving and perpetually confused; the aforementioned self-helper Jim Cunningham, who is desperate to spread the lie that keeps him sane to everybody else; and Donnie's sister, struggling between her identity as an adult and her identity as a child.  And then there's Frank.  All I can say here is that nothing can prepare you for or adequately describe Frank.Probably the best thing about this movie, though, is its incredible emotional range.  It manages to inspire hope, love, dread, laughter, and tears at different points throughout the movie without making you feel least bit like there is a contradiction between those states.  The scenes with Frank (especially the one that takes place in the therapist's office against the backdrop of a conversation about the end of the world) are quite frankly some of the scariest things I've ever seen in a movie, as they literally made my skin crawl.Finally, the performances in this film are exquisite.  The talent in this film is top notch and even Gyllenhall is just amazing.  That said, though, this film has a dismal future.  Combine the fact that the large majority of the moviegoing public is just going to find it unbearably weird with the fact that the movie begins with part of an airplane  crashing into a building (this has got to be the very definition of bad timing) and it's pretty clear that this film is going to stay underground.  However, if you are looking for a beautiful experience with a unique film, _Donnie Darko_ is just about as good as it gets.",9,951,1218,2 December 2001
