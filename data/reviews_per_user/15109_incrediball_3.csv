First Man," Could have been great
","Much has been said about how visually stunning this movie is so we chose the biggest screen in the country to view it on. It did not take long before we had regretted this choice. All but the sequence on the moon was unworthy of an IMAX screen while the entire rest of the movie was jittery, shaky, extreme and out of focus close ups, crazy pans and tilts, zooming in and out, etc all made doubly irritating because of the size of the screen. Totally ruined the movie for us with many non-action scenes totally unwatchable. It could have even been a 9 out of 10 but for us was barely watchable. One of us was even sick and I only didn't walk out because of the subject material and the hope that it would improve, which thankfully it did for the short moon sequence.I honestly don't understand the attraction to this type of cinematography. We humans simply do not see the world in this way and so this only reminds us that we are watching a movie, thus taking us out of the moment and putting us back in the seat in the cinema, especially so as we often preferred to look at objects in the cinema than at the screen much of the time! However what do I know, it would not surprise me if it gets an Academy Award for cinematography.",1,178,330,14 October 2018
The Imitation Game," Computer science got the backseat
","As a software developer, I was interested in this film because of the computer science aspect, particularly during a time when computing was essentially non-existent. Alas the story was overwhelmingly about his personal struggles with repeated flashbacks to his school days and random shots of Benedict Cumberbatch running really fast.The actual computer science side was incorrect because Alan Turing did not invent and build the Bombe (the machine with all the rotating things) from scratch by himself as portrayed in the movie. The British bombe was a development from a device that had been designed in Poland, the initial design being from Alan Turing but the engineering design and construction was undertaken by an entirely different company. It was an official project so the scene when the machine had been running for a day and he fights to keep it running is almost certainly fabrication.While speaking of fabrication, when the machine finally does work in the movie, they happen to decode a really significant message but Alan Turing supposedly decides that they have to keep the news to themselves in order to hide their new capabilities. Not taking action based on every intercept did indeed occur but in real life if he had done that he probably would have been executed for treason! A decision like that resulting in massive loss of life would have been up to the admiralty or the Prime Minister. It simply was not his decision to make.",4,1,1,28 April 2020
Invictus," Stirring and inspiring stuff
",Clearly the world needs more people like Nelson Mandela leading their countries. It takes a special kind of human to forgive and to respect others like he did. Some other people who are now in positions of leadership are considerably more childish.It's a pity that the Springbok victory at the World Cup is marred by the fact that nearly all of the All Blacks had food poisoning and were severely ill. A former chief bodyguard to Nelson Mandela believes betting syndicates were behind the deliberate poisoning.,7,0,0,24 August 2019
