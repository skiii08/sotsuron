The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," THE best by far.
","Honestly, I do have to say that I thought that this movie was the best of all the movies. I think that this was mostly coupled with the fact that Stewart and Pattinson did a MUCH better job acting, maybe because there was less talking and more...action, or maybe Condon just knows how to work with them better. There was definitely a lot less tension between the characters. Secondly, I can understand why someone who hasn't read the book wouldn't like it. I feel like this movie was mostly made for book readers, because parts that would have seemed stupid made more sense in the context of the book. (e.g. shaving her legs, Rosalie's part in it, Edward hearing the baby, Bella writhing in pain as the venom works through her body while remaining motion less on the operating table, Edward's anger at the whole situation, Bella's dreams, etc) in other words, the entire movie. I didn't think it was to complicated for none book readers to understand though, i suppose you'd just have to have a certain taste for the kind of dramatic romance contained in the book. The CGI seemed worse than the thirds, it wasn't the worst CGI i'd ever seen but still. I did feel they did a good job portraying the werewolves thoughts they and though i would have liked to see a little more in relationship build from at least Alice and Jacob or possibly Leah and Jacob, i felt they did a good job covering the most important stuff. What I'm left wondering his how they will successfully introduce the Denali clans back story (book readers know what I'm talking about) without making it seemed kind of forced in there. I realize that it was probably not included so that you wouldn't have to remember it from this movie to understand whats happening in the next movie. Cudos for Taylor Laughtner, I thought he did an excellent job portraying Jacob with all of his snide comments and sarcastic demeanor and natural uncomfortableness at being around the Cullen's all day. I also thought they did a great job at making Bella look sickly and thin. I got cold chills when i saw her shoulder bones. So over all a good movie. the beginning part was always my favorite and the second part just stresses me out to much, and seems like it would be hard to accurately represent without coming across as boring because its a lot of talk and not very much action. I guess we'll find out.",8,7,15,20 November 2011
