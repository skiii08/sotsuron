The Avengers," 'I'll free you.' - From what? - From freedom.
","I think any viewer, buying a ticket for this film, is aware of what he expects to see on the screen. Recently, the film industry has been criticized for the abundance of projects of a purely entertaining nature, including the 'Avengers'. However, if you look closely - it turns out that there is not so much really good and quality entertainment cinema. Some films are boring, some are bluntly stupid; and, for the most part, it turns out that 'entertainment' can be called only a few luxuriously shot scenes, and at other times the viewer is forced to entertain himself with popcorn and cold cola. So the 'Avengers' is a completely different case.I'm not a fan of comic books, and the attitude towards this genre is rather negative, because of its total zashtamovannosti and uncompromising pathos. However, seeing such a spectacle as the 'Avengers', it's hard not to leave your sarcasm aside, and fully enjoy the proposed attraction. Director Joss Weedon, in the beginning, caused me to distrust, in spite of the mass of laudatory reviews, his 'Mission Serenity' did not impress me at all; However, in this case, a clear and confident direction is felt throughout the film. Weedon is also responsible for the script, and here I want to note how competently it is worked out to fill the picture with action to the eye, not forgetting about the meaningfulness and clear drawing of the characters' characters. It is a balanced scenario that makes the film look 'in one go,' and the characters look so charismatic, as necessary for a positive perception of the picture.
Undoubtedly, Marvell approached the project very seriously, presenting 'Torah' and 'First Avenger' last year, these films being technically quite successful in themselves, at the same time became an effective prelude to the main movie event Marvel. And the creators did their best to make the film truly an event that surpassed its historical predecessors. Since almost all the characters are familiar to the viewer, and the story itself is simple and understandable - it makes it possible to fill the picture with spectacular action to the point that it seems unbelievable how all this can fit into one film, even if it lasts more than two hours. At the same time, this is not the case when the entire film is thrown at different locations, trying to diversify the action in this way. The bulk of events takes place on the ship Nick Fury and in New York, but everything is done so qualitatively that not how much it tires. The scene of the massacre in the city in the final is fascinating, although the 'scene' is not called the language, because of its wide time frame. For a very long time the heroes will fight the enemy; everything will jump, fly and explode; and all this in an excellent high-quality 3D. And although the film is not without pathos, I was pleased that the question of the police 'Who are you to command here?' Captain America did not begin to pronounce his name, which the Russian viewer perceives with his teeth, but simply showed in deed.Of course, there is a lot of humor in the film. However, if, for example, in the same 'Sea Battle' creators used humor as a saving thread, literally pulling the picture from the abyss in certain places; in 'Avengers' it is, albeit an obligatory, but an equal part of the overall structure, which works in a complex. This is not the option when you close your eyes to some flaws due to some pluses (an abundance of humor, for example) because there are no obvious shortcomings in all parameters of the production of the film. And the humor itself - yes, sometimes even stiff and sarcastic, chuckling over the heroes and reducing the extra degrees of pathos. In this regard, it is not superfluous to mention that Joss Weedon also had a hand in creating the scenario 'Huts in the Forest', but here, of course, everything is in a softer framework.To say that 'Avengers' is a typical entertaining movie would be fundamentally wrong - in fact Marvel was removed practically by the standard representative of the genre, which uses every minute of its timing as effectively as possible. Mass of spectacular action, magnificent picture in high-quality 3D, wonderful soundtrack, sarcastic humor and nice characters. It is this film that should be considered a grandiose opening of the summer season of blockbusters, as it really sets a very high level.",9,126,208,8 June 2018
The Incredible Hulk," King Hulk
","History.
In the sixties, the company made tremendous progress, as it was during these times that such characters as Iron Man, Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, Daredevil, X-Men and many other heroes were created who are still considered to be the main stars of the vast Universe Marvel.Finished work on the first series of comics about the Fantastic Four, Stan Lee began to look for something completely new and different. Then Lee remembered that one day he really liked the movie 'Frankenstein' (1931), then in the makeweight remembered another masterpiece - 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde' (also in 1931 the year of release).Crossing Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde with Frankenstein Stan Lee got the monster he needed: a terrible outside, good inside (which, moreover, could turn from a man into a monster and vice versa). Originally, Lee made the Hulk gray (he explains that the Hulk is a monster, he must frighten, and gray is a suitable color). But when the first edition was printed, it turned out that the shade changes from drawing to drawing. Therefore, it was decided to find a different color. Thinking about what color a superhero did not yet exist at that time, the thought came that no one had thought of making a character green, and Stan decided to 'Be to him Green!'. So the Hulk became as We know it today.So, May 1962 was marked by the release of a new character from Lee Incredible Hulk and his 'second self' - Doctor Bruce Banner ...
Actors and Heroes.
Edward Norton (Dr. Bruce Banner aka The Incredible Hulk) - I think that Norton has already come across such a split (meaning 'Fight Club', whose main character suffers from a split personality and tries to get rid of his 'companion' in the course of the film).At first glance it may seem that the Hulk is a very primitive character, just an evil monster and nothing more. But everything turns out to be not so simple because there are remnants of human memories in his head (that's why he did not touch Batty and defended her). Part of the Hulk hates Bruce Banner, because for him he is only a miserable nonentity, while the Hulk is an invincible force and power. He constantly feels a split.Probably this is the case when superpower is not a gift, but a curse. The tragic side is manifested when the Hulk again becomes Bruce, and sees the destruction that he did (in the film - this is the destruction of the laboratory at the time of the first transformation of Banner). Then his conscience and guilt tell him that this monster can not be released, and the Doctor consciously goes into exile. Edward Norton is a wonderful dramatic actor, his game conveys the feelings of a lost person: alienation, anguish and grief - the real Dr. Bruce Banner.Liv Tyler (Betty Ross) - like Norton, Liv had a similar role - Arwen (The Elf from the movie 'The Lord of the Rings'): the same deep feelings and the same 'forbidden love', in general, everything is very sad. In Hulk, she plays a strong, and at the same time sincerely loving woman who is ready to fight for her happiness; she is the embodiment of true love. And the way Tyler transmits emotions is really beautiful. In the film, Liv Tyler treats the Hulk as Naomi Watts with King Kong; and the Hulk itself is very similar to Kong: calms down at the sight of his caring beloved, protects her from all the dangerous (and not thinking about his own self-preservation). What more can be said? God grant more such loving women.
Tim Roth (Emil Blonsky aka Abomination) - he plays Russian, who grew up in England and became a soldier (who, moreover, does not drink vodka and does not wear a hat with a fur hat!). He leads a group of professionals gathered to catch Bruce Banner. However, after the friend saw what the Hulk is, he immediately became fired with the desire 'I want the same!'.During the film, Blonsky is injected with the serum of the super-soldier, after which he becomes very fast, strong and enduring. It seemed that he got what he wanted, but after the Green Giant had made a cutlet from him with one blow of his foot - Emil realized that he did not have enough, and he wants more (and eventually achieves it). And what is most surprising is not to take over the world and rule it (like most super villains); but in order to fight properly. If we talk about the actor - then Roth like his hero is very charismatic. The game is good, not fake. Tim in a beautiful form: in his 47 so quickly run and participate in battle scenes - is respected. In general, Tim Roth disproved the opinion of the Coen brothers and Cormac McCarthy; 'Old people' here is the place!Special Effects.
Special effects in the movie a lot. I will not talk about the visualization quality of the Hulk: now, with the modern development of computer graphics, there is simply no need to talk about it, especially with a company like Universal Pictures (which, in my opinion, always wins in quality, both computer graphics and special effects in whole).If you care, you know: everything is fine, muscles are throbbing, hair is developing in the wind, drool from the mouth flying at crying, clothes are bursting; The Hulk runs, jumps and fights, as befits - really. The explosions themselves, the launch of cars and tractors into each other is done at 5+. All the laws of physics were observed: there will not be a Hulk like in the movie Enga Lee fly like a dandelion: he weighs decently for a mountain of muscles and generally a three-meter bald, so that he will fall swiftly and powerfully.The battle of the two giants can not be called otherwise simply as a fierce fight, all the tools at hand are used: stones, bricks, cars (the Abomination still used people) - in general, everything is beautiful, beautiful, incredible!
The result.
'Incredible Hulk' - the second film Marvel Studios. A wonderful cast, good special effects, great sound, not only could one enliven one of the best comics, but also create an incredible film! Adventures, love, hate, good, evil - everything comes into this movie! Sitting in the cinema, I noticed that the Hulk was looking into my eyes, then with a shout of 'Hulk Beat' he ran up to me and hit ... on the spot",8,89,161,8 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The path of one person: the pool of fear
","'Episode I: The Hidden Menace' is perhaps the most ambiguous film in George W. Lucas's 'Star Wars' series. Met by the rather coldly stern gaze of critics, the first film of the new trilogy can cause some confusion in the viewer. There are not many action scenes in it, there are many dialogues and just a leisurely development of actions, which sometimes may seem like a forced filler with a connecting function between fights and races. But this is only at first glance, because if you look closely ...Young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his teacher, Qui-Gon Jin (Liam Neeson), go to negotiations with the Trade Federation, which threatens to blockade the peaceful little planet of Naboo. In Obi-Wan's eyes, his mind and vision are already visible, his movements are already full of courage and confidence. Confidence and powerful, unquestioning dedication are seen in the young queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) that she is ready to do anything to help her people, the inhabitants of the occupied world federation. It is in 'The Phantom Menace' most accurately and correctly disclose the nature and fragile at the same time in BOGATYRSKY solid Padme: it is able to stand alone against the decision of the Senate, venturing recklessly brave adventures and combine intuitive dictates of the heart with equanimity of mind.Qui-Gon Jin is unshakable and calm, in whatever situation he was. His eyes radiate wisdom and strength, a smile condescendingly reasonable, and the movements are smooth and weighed. But the main feature of Obi-Wan's teacher is not in these, of course, the most important qualities. Qui-Gon, first of all, is a man of exceptional faith. Some of his actions seem too risky and thoughtless, but somewhere in general they can be mistaken for a desperate bluff. But for him, extremely sensitive to everything around him, holding in an unsurpassed harmony the awareness of his own forces and the sense of difficulty of the tasks set, for him, who knows how to feel the situation on many, many forward steps, faith is the main tool. With her help, he stands unshakably on his feet, seeking his own, by all means.Once having set a goal - to certainly train quite a young Anakin Skywalker - Qui-Gon will go to her persistently and steadily. He alone believes in the Prophecy of the great destiny of the boy, as if he did not hear the fears of the Jedi Council that Anakin's uncertain future could pose great troubles to the Galaxy. But the foresight and the unique sense of Qui-Gon's world allow him to see far further than to his eminent like-minded people and mentors, like Master Yoda and Master Windu. In addition, an extraordinary faith allows Qui-Gon to destroy any of his fears and doubts that can obscure his clear eyes. The moment of the film is very important, in which the wise Jedi tells Anakin about the medichlorians, micro-organisms existing in symbiosis with the cells of any living organism.
Perhaps, in these mysterious media chlorians lies the human soul, elusive to the eye and non-existent for touch. Then the wise counsel of Qui-Gon Jinn and unselfish greed deprived the boy Anakin Skywalker, wanted to visit every planet in the universe, it seems quite clear and sharp, Go up to the call of the heart, and you go on the right path. And even though this road is lost in the darkness of the gathering clouds, there will always be someone who sees a little farther than everyone else, and builds on this sagacity its most powerful faith. Qui-Gon believed in Anakin from the first second and believed in him to the end; most likely he understood the suffering and upheavals that promised further training of the boy for the Galaxy and for himself, but in one thing he was certain that in the final analysis Skywalker would return the Force to equilibrium ...Finishing on the major note of universal jubilation and festivities, 'Episode I: The Hidden Menace' at first glance does not justify its mysterious and menacing title. But, having looked a little closer, we see that the holiday is just a calm before the storm, and a sweet truce is a tricky tactical ploy. It also becomes clear with horror that all the actions of all the heroes are quite comparable with the freedom to choose the actions of puppets tied to strong threads, for which someone is confidently pulling, able to control the movements of dolls by the easy fingering.And the violent protest of Padme Amidaly at the Senate meeting, and the murder of the mighty Darth Moule, and the fiasco of the Trade Federation, and the heroic death of Qui-Gon Gin, are all foggings in the plan of the mysterious strategist who is still hiding far from the battlefields, its galactic war. And Anakin Skywalker's aching lead heart, which is filled with a burning, drying fear after the death of a Jedi so much loved by him, also lies in a small coin, albeit of a larger value than the rest, on a comprehensive battle map of the devilish clever and cunning puppeteer.
The beginning of the saga is laid, the heroes are represented, the plot knots are tied. Star Wars Beginning",8,137,185,4 June 2018
Iron Man 3," Not a single costume
","It's time to say goodbye. No, Tony Stark will not get anywhere from us, Iron Man is still at the top of Olympus Marvel. But it will never be the same again, because the cycle of the name Robert Downey Jr. comes to the end. Enjoy the same ellipsis of a beautiful trilogy, worthy of his hero.The third film turned out to be minimal superhero, but as human as possible. To achieve such an effect was possible because of a change of man in the director's chair - the place of joker John Favreau was taken by Shane Black. The screenwriter of The Deadly Guns received an appointment clearly in an old friendship with Downey. It so happened that the iconic for both 'The Kiss' (for Robert to a lesser extent, of course) makes itself felt in the story of the 'Iron Man' - if the last two films were simply 'not serious', then this time we can safely be called the funniest in the trilogy. In addition to abundant jokes, some plot twists from the duo's past collaborative work are also guessed.Robert Downey Jr. now spends much less time in a suit. After the events in New York ('The Avengers') he is overcome by panic: and suddenly something like this will happen again, suddenly Pepper will again be in danger. In a suit, fear goes, then he and Iron Man, but the battle with yourself has to lead literally with bare hands. The costume, in turn, does not disappear from the screen, it is multiplied either independently, or under the control of the skillful AI Jarvis, thereby preventing Robert's talent, the flow of which is always a little bit, but restrained by the suit. The screen time and Gwyneth Paltrow increased, for this incarnation of beloved Stark, this is actually also the last fight and this time it gives a light to the old one.
With enemies everything is much better than last time. First of all, the mysterious Mandarin. Sir Ben Kingsley and his character is SPOILER riding a spoiler, plus a spoiler and chases. It is not enough, but it surprises him fantastically, for it completely changes the preliminary opinion about the film and from fears that ZhCH3 turned into the fall of the Dark Knight, there is no trace. The second villain went to Guy Pearce. The Englishman goes deeper and deeper into the abyss of extremely negative roles, which, incidentally, is not bad, because the hostage of one role is definitely not about him.Flashed on the screen by tradition and Stan Lee, without which there would be no comic books about Tony Stark and there would not be anything else. A few months before the premiere of Iron Man 3, the master turned 90 years old.The funny pseudo-realism Iron Man 3 captivates. With the change of director, the film also changed, which pays more time to Tony Stark, and not to Iron Man. Who knows, Robert Downey Jr. may someday. will return to his main superhero role, but so far the film and he himself hint that it's time to move on. Finally, Marvel gives the audience a cocktail of humor, action and nostalgia, supplemented by a slice of the beloved actor and a piece of the universe after the credits.",8,97,171,8 June 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," What the VII episode didnt become
","Long ago, when I had a poor understanding of the cinematographic universe, when the plot of films was deeply indifferent to me, I saw a wonderful film in which the hero escaped in the belly of a dead unknown beast, and giant metal elephant-turtles walked along the snow-covered planet. And, I did not think that these feelings can be repeated in adulthood.Unexpected discovery: Rogue One, one woke a child in me, although the plot was clear, and there was no infantile desire to jump into tact with gunfights and fights. It was just great. It was just a classic trilogy, elevated to the absolute. It's just the same as many years ago. And, what is very important, without any hidden pathos, without an obsessive director's 'wink' in the style of 'well, you realized that this character returned and everyone giggles and applauds.'So, Rogue One, of course, is a fresh look. This is another camera work. These are other perspectives and, as was rightly noted in trailer analyzes, this is an amazing work with scales. The director and the cameraman made things that you believe in. You believe in the size of the Death Star. Believe in the size of the Star Destroyer. And, okay, it would be one thing: launched a comparative infographics, and finished on that one. No, here all objects of space are constantly involved in some kind of action. The Death Star moves, the Destroyers engage in battle, the transport workers, fighter jets and bombers are fighting alongside. This is a 'wow', this is 'super', this is the star thriller we wanted. The fighter in which the fighters actually shoot down the enemy, and the bombers cause point torpedo strikes, where the technique creates a real cover, and not just 'hanging around for the crowd', as in the Awakening of the Force. And, yes, this is the very setting of the fights that was in the original trilogy. I am delighted. This is a new operator's view of the old scale of star battles.The next moment is the preservation of the style of Lucas. Here everything pleases not less. This is a city similar both to Naboo I episode and Tatooine IV episode. This is nature, similar to what we saw in the second part (during the rapprochement of Anakin with Amidala), or on Kashyyyk with its battles in the woods. Everything looks natural and beautiful. There are no eared adherents of the dark side, wading through unnatural winter forests, built on an old 3D engine. The whole environment looks beautiful, relevant, familiar in the atmosphere. It seems that this is called landscape design.The plot of the film is not snotty, does not shine with pathos. Everything happens naturally. Heroes look vital, at first glance, there is no logic. The actors also played very well. Emotions want to believe, the motivation is clear.VII episode of the Star Wars exported at the expense of the name. If you remove the name, you will receive a parody of the IV part with comical physics and a trash story. But Rogue One is a terrific epic saga. One of the best films in the universe of Star Wars.",9,244,353,2 June 2018
Captain Marvel," Why is this all about?
","Going to Captain Marvel's pre-show, I was not expecting anything particularly interesting - lately, Marvel Studious paintings can only boast of beautiful fighting scenes and colorful characters. Unfortunately, there is nothing out of this. At the same time, the film was shot in the pleasant colors of Star Trek - well, it reminds him very much. At the same time, he doesn't carry any meaning to himself, even for Marvel fans, because if you remove this film, nothing will change.It is worth noting that Bree Larson is playing well, but there's nothing to say about Jackson - he is at his best, as usual. Jude Law, surprisingly, fits well, although not surprisingly, he ideally goes to play this kind of characters. Well, it seems that the positives end there, because the soundtrack in the film is very weak, and there's really nothing to look at.To take and squeeze this movie to 10 minutes and show it in the following Avengers would be a far better solution. But, of course, you need to keep the pipeline at the ready.4 out of 10For the cat and the eyes of Samuel Jackson.",4,152,330,7 March 2019
Iron Man 2," '- People often ask me how I go to the toilet in this suit? ..' ©
","So, after the publication of the first full-length Iron Man and its success with the audience (the box office speaks for itself), many with genuine interest waited for the sequel release - and Casey Cooper is no exception to this long list.As a result, I looked, I was glad with all my heart and made an inspired conclusion - the potential of 'Iron Man' on the whole scale resulted in the second part in an excellent entertaining blockbuster and one of the best comic book adaptations that I saw.But let's start with the laws of sequels, or rather not from laws (after all, they are not always fulfilled in the production of film products), but from the expectations of the audience: from the second part we expect even more scope, more humor, more battles, more heroes than in the original - and 'Iron Man' all these expectations justified.In addition, he gave an occasion to be stunned by characters with Russian roots - how nice it was to hear that China, Korea, Iran for another 10 years will not reach the technology of Tony Stark (and the competing American company 'Hammer' - all 20), and Russian, well and let the villain on the film, Ivan Vanko in the handicraft conditions did not worse, and even made so much noise!Now back to the original - remember all that you liked the first 'Iron Man' - so all this you will find in the sequel, only in places you need to multiply by 2 - and above all it concerns characters.Tony Stark did not change from the first picture and remained an amazing combination of playboy / genius / showman - so Robert Downey Jr. did not disappoint and gave out the same standing image, maybe even with some deeper into the inner world of the hero (again he does not everything is smooth with health, yes, even here my father was attached).Gwyneth Paltrow gave exactly the same image, exactly the same - no more, no less.For a couple of moments, that is, a couple of appearances on the screen pleased Nick Fury in the performance of Samuel L. Jackson, although there is no need to expect any action from him.Tony Stark's best friend changed face - in the original played Terrence Howard, and now Don Cheadle - but I somehow did not notice the difference (probably because the first part looked a long time and the character there was not the most important place), but he had to act much more - including in the suit of an iron man.Mickey Rourke portrayed a gifted mind, a hatred for the Stark family and a bunch of tattoos of the villain Ivan Vanko (in the comics - Whip), as it is required from comics, that is, beyond the PG-13 with any profanity or something did not come out, but the image was on the whole turned out worthwhile.Scarlett Johansson was beautiful and with dark hair, but her character presented a couple of surprises - first of all, I repeat: I did not expect such an image (or I interrupt memories from memories) - so as not to spoil, I will not describe all this, but in the course of the picture, all expectations around her character were covered with a copper basin, although what happened turned out to be different, but not bad at all - a couple of spectacular appearances in the course of the film, to finally shine in the finale.Sam Rockwell - did not even know that he was playing here - I can not really single out his character - Justin Hammer - the head of a competing company (primarily because Tony, as it should be, was simply eclipsed), but the actor did everything that was required of him.Final - this is generally a separate merit - the ending of the original and next to it was not compared with the large-scale, spectacular and numerous finale of the second part. Bravo for such a brilliant finishing touch! Although neither the beginning nor the middle was disappointed - another brilliant combination of Tony Stark's humor, an excursion into his rampant life, a fight scene in the beginning and the middle as a foretaste of a much more significant and multifaceted final fight.Result: the first 'Iron Man' was remembered by the bright, but classic manner of adaptations of comic strips with the appropriate filling in the plot plan, which allowed him to become not a breakthrough, but the primacy of traditions and a worthy spectacle for entertainers in general and comics in particular - and the second part from the original in no way fell behind, and in many ways even surpassed him.",8,63,128,4 June 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Good!
","There is in this picture one virtue that covers everything else - this is a story. I compare this film with chess - after every turn or word of this or that hero the situation changes dramatically and the alignment of forces acquires a new character.Better than anyone can manipulate the moves of Jack Sparrow. He is very sensitive to the nerve of conversation, instantly assesses the situation and gives a decent response to any 'gifts' of fate. From the first viewing it is difficult to realize how profound the film is.Behind external beauty, a good game of actors hides a famously twisted, dynamic and very clever plot.Everyone who does not like the picture, I advise you to review it more carefully, listening to the dialogue of the characters and trying to understand the motives of their actions. I assure you will get a real pleasure! An outstanding film!",8,86,151,8 June 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Gentlemen, ladies .... You will forever remember the day when you first saw the incomparable Captain Jack Sparrow!
","This film impressed me right after the first viewing, in August 2003, after which the following followed and so quietly peacefully, imperceptibly, I probably approached the mark of ten views. In principle, it's worth it, this film can already be called a legend, and it's a pleasure to watch such films.And now also compare with the sequel, but in fact someone seriously believes that the sequel came out better than the first episode. I, of course, do not agree with this, but I will not argue, everyone has an opinion, and there will be euphoria from viewing (views) of the 'Deadlock Chest' and people will soberly look at the 'Curse of the Black Pearl' and realize that the second part is not even nearby worth, but it is also a product of the highest class.The first film is better, maybe not all, but in humor and the plot exactly, and even such a banal sign as novelty, in the second part we saw only a sequel, a slightly different story with the same characters, and in the first film, it was all new , and moments are brilliant. When I speak genius with regard to this film, then, of course, I have the look of Jack Sparrow in the incredible performance of Johnny Depp.
This is one of his best roles, from the very beginning he was performed in a genuinely brilliant way, from the first appearance on the screen to the eighth when he sailed on a small boat, flowing through all the cracks, to excellent music - completely capturing the episode, one of the best in all movie. And his first step to Port Royal, an English colony in the Caribbean. And after it began ...The whole genius of Jack Sparrow's image can not be conveyed in words, that's why we watch this film and review it time after time, and expect the continuation. Especially the second part is the benefit of Jack, and in the first and except for Jack there was a lot of interesting things.About humor, plot, music, I already said. And also this is the Captain of the 'Black Pearl' Barbossa, some minor characters among the Barbosa pirates and among Jack's team. In addition, you can add to the appearance of Jack in the city of Torturra, a meeting with old friends and friends. Or repeated scenes, when Barbossa and Sparrow are in one frame. All these and other episodes can only be admired, for, they do not bother and remain in the memory.
The plot of the first part is much more interesting than the plot of continuation, besides the ship full of skeletons under the moonlight, where it surpasses the ship from the team in the form of sea monsters-yudisch. Special effects are here and there at a level, at a high level.Pirate films now go to the screens of the world a little, and no one can surpass the Pirates of the Caribbean Sea, here in fact there is even a romantic story between Elizabeth and William, the only problem for them is that it moves back to the second or third plan , thanks to the excellent performance of pirates of their roles.Young Bloom and Knightley could not support the level of their older colleagues, I would say that it's forgivable for them, if they were not so important to the director and producers, and in the eyes of ordinary fans of this film, they are not visible, they swam far beyond the horizon, only, unfortunately, sometimes appear on the screen saying important phrases, for me these characters are superfluous.
About Bloom, you can talk separately, his goal is to play a simpleton, spinning around the main character, sometimes trying to throw out an incredible and very daring trick, in the first part he still copes with the role of a simpleton, but when he tries to play the guy, everything fails, he does not go, and should run all career in a skirt of Paris. And in the second part of it they are already trying to make a serious man, give a chance to steer at the head of the film, but time to think, because Jack can not block him, and he does not want to be funny, but could try, maybe an idiot with the protagonist - his role ?The screen time for the Knightley-Bloom duo is very little allocated, I mean when they are together, and for this it is necessary to say a special thanks to the creators of the film, this does not allow to turn the film into a love story of two childhood friends, but, damn it, from time to time they turn out to be in one frame, and these frames can easily be called not the most interesting for the whole film, in the sense of an acting game, because these young actors do not show anything super-ordinary.
Ditch the ocean, shoot cannons (even with forks), rob ships and ports here is the destiny of pirates, and after they also appear on the screen under the magnificent setting of Verbinsky - that's the real movie. The spark from the sensations is getting stronger, the film practically does not allow him to tear himself away for two and a half hours of viewing, except for the episodes of Knightley-Bloom, but this does not prevent the movie from watching when Jack Sparrow appears from the second to the second.The film really deserves only flattering reviews. The ending of the film, although romantic, but much better than in the second part, when I did not see the ending, it was simply not invented - it's the main and very big minus of the second part, but now the conversation is not about it, because the first part ended very much in rating , I do not mean the MPAA rating, but the main thing is that it's a cobblestone in the sequel garden.This movie you will remember as the best one in which Captain Jack Sparrow was almost hanged.",9,74,142,8 June 2018
Deadpool 2," The mad harlequin returns
","Two years ago, Ryan Reynolds' long-standing dream came true: the screen saw the screening of the 'Deadpool' spitting on all morals and the foundations of the comic book. And as well as commercially there was a bomb success, it was proved that the charm is not only in black humor, greasiness and izhe.And now the same team returned. Plus 100 million of the budget (the budget of the first in the region of 50), minus Tim Miller.In my opinion, the director's change did not affect what was happening. But many were worried. It seems to me that everything is on Reynolds. On his charisma, zadore, drive and positive. Perhaps he was in the director's chair, and not only in the position of the co-author of the script and the producer. Even the promo campaign was also strong and with a ton of banter!In general, the attraction develops according to the same plot scheme. Added characters, events. That's exactly what became more interesting - the appearance of the Cable. He really and excellent counterbalance to the mercenary-chatterbox, brighter than Ajax from the first part. Yes, the conflict built on it is also excellent.And Brolin has finally proved himself in the movie comic book. It's not Thanos to voice! His bestial grin and brutality organically blended with the narrative. And I can not imagine an actor who played this character better.Wonderfully fit and Bitz. Graceful young lady, perfectly acting out a comedic image. Everything is very organic. Boyega - learn!And among the jokes about genitals, bunches and other sodomy, serious topics also run through: for example, the theme of family and relationships. And this, like in the case of the 'Sentinels', is not attracted by the ears - dear audience, laughter with laughter, but do not forget about serious.As for humor, then the authors also took a new line - in self-irony. I have not seen such a sincere and charming banter over myself for a long time! And here there is no transition to self-flagellation or kinks in the spirit of some publications. Even black humor and jokes below the pager are served deliciously and in moderation, rather than a stream from the machine gun a la modern comedies.Keep the Mark!An excellent adult action movie with meat, black humor, self-irony and banter over everyone and everything.One question - what will surprise us in the third part?

Thor: Ragnarok," «No Hammer. No Problem »
","Every year, with bated breath and absorbing one trailer after another, a huge audience of Marvel fans waiting for movies within their beloved universe. The cinematic world created by Marvel Studios will very soon celebrate its decade and for such a long time, directors from the camp of the 'reds' managed to create a lot of bright, inspirational and truly steep bands about superheroes.While the competitors are trying to keep up with the MCU, the creators of the Marvel universe from the world of cinema - roared to its fullest. Space budgets that allow you to attract great actors and show incredible beauty special effects - the best motivation for the creator, allowing you to unfold 'in full' from a professional point of view. Nothing distracts the directors of Marvel from the main thing, the work. They completely give themselves to their projects, from that and watch them a pleasure.'Thor: Ragnarok' was no exception. Moreover, the third part about the adventures of God of Scandinavian mythology can rightly be called the most ingenious film MCU. Why? Let's try to understand with you, once again chanting the thankful tirade Marvel for a similar approach to filmmaking.The director of the third 'solo' film about the Torah was the New Zealand comedy director, a man who was not deprived of a sense of humor, 42-year-old Taika Vaitichi ('Real Ghouls.') Tyka, of course, did not have experience in producing blockbusters and shot mostly low-budget comedy dramas. But, as we know, for the Marvel bosses, long ago, not an indicator of 'experience and payback.' For the 'Red Bosses', as we saw in the example of Favreau and Gunn, the main thing is excitement and 'fire' in the eyes of the creator. caught fire 'to put the film, then his own, giving himself up to work completely, then he is an ideal candidate for a director's chair.If you compare solo films about the Torah with solo ribbons about other heroes of Marvel, then Goldilocks clearly 'loses' to colleagues on all fronts. Too serious were the films about the hero Chris Hemsworth, devoid of superhero gloss ... Like a dry breakfast from a company that you do not like - yes, at times tasty, but not at all. And the fault in this was both the studio and the directors, which this studio assigned. The first film about the Torah was staged by Cannes laureate, who was shooting dry dramas, and the second tape was filmed by a serial director who worked on classy multiseries ('Sopranos', 'Rome'), but having no idea what and how works in a big movie From the appointment of Taiki to the post, from the very beginning it looked like a cry of the soul of the MCU bosses - if he does not cope, then no one will cope.First of all, the third film about the Torah completely changed its positioning. Down with the fresh supply of Scandinavian mythology to the comic! Now the ball is ruled by humor! And not just stupid jokes inappropriately, but ingenious, bursting typical Marvel banter patterns, riveting to the screen from the first minutes of viewing. Over the years, each of us has become accustomed to the typical construction of films of a superhero genre ... A skeleton over which history is built up. So Taika and his team, not giving a damn about the 'canons' and 'covenants', lit up to the full, deriding the scheme used by 'fellow workers' from year to year.'Mjolnir' The Torah can only hold a decent one, and it is forged from a dying star, which gives the hammer an incredible striking force? Turn it into dust for the first ten minutes of the timing! And there are many such moments in the film. To laugh will have to be loud and long, from scene to scene, from dialogue to dialogue.In addition to good humor, the film features wildly powerful female characters. No, not as sleek, like a Wonder Woman getting up to his full height of the trench, inspiring frightened to death of men ... And the real, live, as far as possible within the comics. For them, there is not enough pathetic-fresh nonsense that poured into the ears of the characters of the previous films. From now on they need motivation to risk their lives. Now they will not go into hell after the phrase 'We need to save Asgard!', It's not enough for them. They need to be persuaded, to gain confidence with their leadership qualities and only then ask for help. And even after that, it's completely 'not a fact' that they will agree.A separate line of praise for the third film about the Torah, I want to mention the inimitable Jeff Goldyublum in the image of Grandmaster. The character of Jeff, a dictator in miniature, running a planet-dump, where gladiatorial fights predominate. He disposes of lives like a ringing coin in his pocket, 'squandering' her for his own pleasure. Emancipated, charismatic and incredibly attractive character. I sincerely hope that one day we will see this hero, performed by Jeff and the Collector from the 'Guardians', performed by Benicio Del Toro. Why not? In comic books these two are best friends!The result. 'Thor: Ragnarok' is a film that gives a vivid understanding of how much the 'standard' molding schemes of the Marvel Studios are molded. Taika Vaitichi, through the prism of humor and ridicule, hints: 'It's time to change the positioning.' Hell, even if James Gunn acknowledged this by comparing the 'Torah' with the 'magical cassette from the 80's', what are the other MCU directors waiting for? The time of serious people is gone, Marvel.Continue in the same spirit, beat on all the strings at the same time!'Father, she destroyed the hammer ...'

Spider-Man: Homecoming," Another friendly neighbor
","To hell with the whining about what this is about restarting about Spider-Man, after all the friendly neighbor in red-and-blue tights finally became a part of the Marvel coterie, and these guys know a lot about their business, and, most importantly, learn from mistakes . You can compare three different Spiders and their performers endlessly, but this is almost the same as the argument that Parker distorts on MJ in comics, and what - in the film. Strictly speaking, not everything is put according to a certain pattern, hence the different screen versions, different characters and stories. However, if you could find fault with Maguire for snotty, and Garfield for self-centeredness, Holland is still more difficult to make claims, as Marvelers see a fresh approach to working with the character taking into account past flaws and, importantly, without selfrepetition. We will not be shown either the bite of the radioactive spider or the death of Uncle Ben, nor will they remind us that 'great power comes with great responsibility,' even though Tony Stark, Peter's current mentor, seems to have been trying. Spiderman again appears as a schoolboy, except that this time school life really boils.A flying dude does not surprise anyone in tights, especially in New York, where the residents saw the alien invasion and the battle of the Avengers. You will think, the guy weaves a web, - there, the muzhik turns to the green bully, and the Scandinavian god thunderes all with a magic hammer. Therefore, understanding the whole situation, the creators use, perhaps, the most successful method - irony. And it manifests itself in all its glory: the film ironically over superpowers and clichés, and in the end and at all successfully jokes over spectators who stubbornly sit down to the end of the credits. As for the superhero life, it does not really fit in with the school, and Parker learns to combine saving the city and passing the test in Spanish, and also spending time with Aunt Mei. By the way, we have the most sexy Aunt May, about which the creators will not miss the opportunity to joke. A spider, as it turns out, is not always super-krut: he also has to run around without cobwebs, and crash into different objects, and, after all, he can make mistakes, like any teenager who is also motivated by the desire to prove himself. Peter does not have much time to show the old woman the path, he wants something more. And without waiting for a call from Stark or Happy, he enters into a confrontation with the Vulture, who, along with his team, collects weapons from extraterrestrial wrecks after that very battle of the Avengers.Among other advantages, John Watts' film stands out for its earthiness and realism, despite the fact that the action takes place within the Marvel cable car. Realistic, of course, relative, but the picture does not have that patheticity that was in the possession of Raimi or Webb, 'Homecoming' is even more prosaic than the previous Marvel tapes, and it's ironic. Which is no less important, so it's a slightly more interesting antagonist than the typical Marvelovsky, which, thanks to the charisma of Michael Keaton, does not fade in the background of the main character. Moreover, the Vulture appears not as a classic villain, trying to destroy everything and everything, but an ordinary person who wants, like Parker, to prove himself somehow, although for this he chooses a wrong way. Watt's tape - in fact, it's a story about growing up, about mistakes of youth and the right decisions made due to some life experience. That's why watching Parker's school life is no less interesting than watching his superhero adventures. Funny episodes sometimes turn into dramatic, but the film follows the balance and does not slide into pathos, even wherever it could. The picture has a contagious energy, to match his hero. And it's definitely the same 'Spider-Man' that will please the boy inside of you, even if he grew up on Raimi movies.",9,81,148,4 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," When a tiny ray drew the entire galaxy to the Light ...
","So the legendary original trilogy 'Star Wars' came up to its logical end, for 6 years it excited the minds of the audience. Lucas and the company present to us the long-awaited finale, which will finally put all the points in the fates of the heroes and give us one of the most spectacular space battles between Good and Evil.This time, the little-known Richard Markwand sits in the director's chair. All of us favorite 'father' STAR WARS George Lucas acted only as a screenwriter. For which it can be praised, because the script was very good, without long actions and dialogues, and most importantly-exciting.The Far-Far Galaxy becomes the battlefield between the Empire and the Rebels. The construction of the second Death Star is coming to an end, and anticipating an early attack of the rebels, the head of the evil galactic state Emperor Palpatine arrives at the station to watch the battle, arrogantly hoping for the victory of the imperial forces. Meanwhile, the drama continues to develop between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. The former farm boy knew the Force and now he is waiting for the final fight with Lord Sith. Luke believes that there is still good in him and that there is still a chance for salvation.In addition to meeting with Vader Luke, in the company of his friends: Leah, Chewbacca and the droids R2D2 and C3PO saves Han Solo from the slippery claws of the gangster Jabba the Hutt. And soon the main characters are reunited with the forces of the Rebellion to prepare for the final battle.Actor's game, once again, you can praise. Mark Hammil again shone. The tension he felt, fighting inside himself with anger, spurred by the Emperor, was transmitted from the screen and made him feel empathic with the protagonist. Carrie Fisher, this time, supplemented her game with a beautiful figure, so often flashed at the beginning of the picture. Harrison Ford once again proved that he is an excellent actor who does not give up his position. I would especially like to note Ian McDiarmid. The image of the Emperor was excellent. How much evil, arrogance, excessive pride. This actor played Palpatine just as well in the prequel trilogy.Visual effects, as it should for STAR WARS, are performed at the highest level of quality. The abundance of space battles, fights on lightsabers, technology - all this due to high quality becomes a matter of good nostalgia. I really liked the new characters - Ewoks, little bear cubs-aborigines of the green planet Endor, on whose orbit the 'Death Star' was built.I want to say a big thank you to John Williams for the fact that this magnificent composer rejoiced with his delightful melodies throughout all the sagas, both original and prequel trilogy.The picture has once again proved that, no matter how gloomy and dark the world is, even the slightest ray of light can illuminate this world.George, along with Richard, completed the saga dignifiedly, in a big way. But, as we know, Lucas's imagination is unlimited and the departure to the history of the Star Wars has been postponed, since 16 years later a new episode appeared - 'The Hidden Menace', which marked the return of the phenomenon to the screens.",9,57,121,4 June 2018
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Do not trust anyone but yourself.
","On March 19, Marvel and Disney withdrew a ban on the publication of any reviews and reviews of the over-coming spring blockbuster 'The First Avenger: Another War.' They were removed because it was on this day that a special, first in Russia closed film was shown at the Oktyabr cinema. Unfortunately, no photographs could be made, since Marvel on similar premieres usually requires to hand over at the entrance to the hall all electronic devices. But, nevertheless, the film itself is important.After the attempt on the very director of 'Shield' Nick Fury, it becomes clear that the traitors are deep inside the organization itself. Captain America is involved in a large-scale villainous action to destroy disagreeable 'Hydra' personalities. Moreover, he, like the Black Widow, is wanted as a possible supporter of a secret conspiracy. Now he can trust only himself. In addition to everything, a mysterious masked man appears on the scene, known as the Winter Soldier, who has practically the same powers as Steve Rogers himself.Nothing more on the subject can not say, since it will necessarily entail spoilers, because the movie is directly packed full of intrigues and incredible plot twists. During the show, the hall repeatedly exploded with applause at the next plot move.As a person who has watched repeatedly any of the existing Marvel films, I can say that 'The First Avenger 2' can rightfully be considered one of the best, filmed by the studio. The fact is that after the plague success of the 'Avengers' abounding with colorful characters, you involuntarily begin to compare each next film with them. In my opinion, Thor is the weakest hero in order to play solo. If not for the charismatic Loki, the film in general would be very weak. The first 'Captain' also did not differ in any scale and originality of the plot, but in the sequel everything is quite different.
To begin with, the second part has grown significantly in terms of special effects. It is understandable - after all, the action takes place already in the modern world, and not during the Second World War. In addition to this company Cap was composed of Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson) and the red-haired beauty of the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), as well as the new character Sokol (Anthony Maki). All this ensemble is simply superbly interacting with each other, succeeding and joking, and even add a small share of romance. (No blueness, it's all right). Scarlett Johansson has a lot of time, which allows her character and true intentions to be revealed. It makes no sense to say something about the acting, because these characters are performed by the same actors for the first time.There are a lot of questions in the film, which remain almost unanswered. Why was the attempt on Nick Fury committed? Who is behind this? Who is this Winter Soldier and where did he come from? Who can be trusted when there are only traitors around? Fortunately, you will certainly know the answers by the end of the film. By the way, it is worth saying that the ending leaves room for trikvela, which, of course, will be.As I wrote earlier, you involuntarily compare any solo film of heroes from the Avengers with the Avengers themselves. So the 'First Avenger' can easily compete with the flagship team of superheroes. The plot is twisted much more seriously, than there, jokes and references also suffice in excess. The only drawback of the film - the absence of the agent Phil Colson, which has long been an integral part of the Marvel blockbuster. If someone does not know, the most charming agent of SHIELD does not actually die in Avengers. This is seen in the series 'Agents SHIELD', which also produces now Marvel.
The picture was shown to us in the IMAX 3D format. And I must say that it looks really cool. Again, comparing with the scale of the 'Avengers', the spectacle here is no worse. And somewhere even better. It can be seen that the creators tried to do without the use of computer graphics in those places where it was possible. Therefore, the natural filming in the film is much more than artificially drawn episodes.In short, strange as it may sound, 'The First Avenger: Another War' is different from any other Marvel movie. At least because of the fact that there is not all tied up on the steep heroes and fatal beauties. Here you will find also a certain hidden subtext, which someone, perhaps, will make you think. After all, Captain America is not just another superhero. This is the most patriotic man in America, her symbol. By the will of fate, he was not in his time and not in his world, but he had to make up for what he had missed in 70 years. He is tormented by a sense of guilt and a feeling that he is not the one who needs this world. But only a real hero is able to find the strength to forget about himself and fight for his friends.And finally, the remark about the localization of the film's name. Someone will find it funny how our distributors translated this title. But I assure you, they did it for a reason. 'Other War' in this case conveys the meaning of the film better than the original name itself.",8,85,157,13 June 2018
Doctor Strange," I am a traveler of both time and space, to be, where I have been ©
","The story of Stephen Strange, a neurosurgeon-the otherworld defender of the universe-is like a surname. A difficult destiny is the character, which he was able to push into the comic world, gently, with varying success. Charisma uncle is not deprived, but very much chakras-mantras-boddhisattva, accompanying his forces and abilities, went against the brute force of the reader's usual superheroes. At the end of the era, they forgot about him altogether, with a nostalgic smile hidden in that box of the sixties, where beads-rosaries, Pucci's prints, preparations for the expansion of consciousness and faith in the possibility of changing the world with a broad smile lay already.In the tenth years of the twenty-first century, in which everything new is a tolerantly fused old, the name of Strange again surfaced. It was sparkling, you can say, in the name of the Marvel genius, to make money from the air density of scripts, good visualization and simple humor. While DC breaks both to itself and the spectator with its three-hour, high-flown epics, Marvel, though slightly podraasteravshy old lightness, is still the same trampled caring and mummy road - eat, viewer, our gruel. Do not push (it will not be difficult - we promise). Do not burn yourself (here's the PG-13 rating). Do not be fooled (we sent you sentries so that you will not forget, as it was in the previous thirty-two films). And how about writing a powerful wizard with esoteric powers and psychedelic patterns in this template template? Yes, a trifle, it is not even worth the trouble, it sits like poured.It helped that Dr. Strange, who appeared to the world not in the best times for comics, is in itself simple as a one-color Rubik's cube. It was not initially difficult - for perception it was complicated by the surrounding situation of a tent under LSD. Reject unnecessary - and get 'I do not want to be a hero - it's dangerous! - I must be a hero. ' This is what the Marvel script writers used, revealing the hero exactly to the extent that it will help him to be adequately sequenced, trikvelizirovatsya and otsylnichat in the future. But there is one detail in 'Strange', which makes it a curious movie for watching not only the fans and ordinary lovers of beautiful bubuhs, but also the comedian who is tired of comics, can bring something in a bowl with strong tea. It's about philosophy.
The Strange's world is, first and foremost, a psychedel, which was desperately lacking during the fighting. The fact that the hobo-neurosurgeon was flown once inside the consciousness warms the soul of some pathetic five minutes, and the rest of the time the Mr. Doctor runs on foot and fights with sparks. Not enough skills were not enough for the creators of special effects (the transformations of the buildings were very impressive, Nolan's team puts the class), how much imagination to show something out of the ordinary. Let's say that there was no need to get out of the way because of the desire to not stretch the target audience - which is sad, because walking around the universe of Doctor Strange is at times more fun than drawing another Zakovi, a standard eastern market or a three thousandth Hydra bunker. Believe me, comrades from Hollywood - we are courageous, we are not afraid, we will be happy to see your fantasies. Do not be shy and do not limit yourself, and then, smelling senses, Asgard was our last gift in terms of visualization raisins.And a skeptical raised eyebrow is given to Marvel for another fused villain. Honestly, you simply did not know to which project to attach the extensive fan base of Mads Mikkelsen. However, this is empty: complaining about the clichés in comic films is like yelling at the wind, so as not to blow.Enjoy watching",8,98,172,13 June 2018
Interstellar," Theory of everything
","How hard it is, probably, not to break under the exorbitant weight of threatening ambitions, especially when it comes to 'the most anticipated film of the year' - that's how and in no other way did they call the last work of Christopher Nolan in a cinema environment. The benefits of this hysteria are few. Do not wait for 'everything, and immediately, and more', because the blockbuster - the last word that comes to mind when trying to somehow characterize the 'Interstellar', because the intellect here clearly outweighs even such a smart exterior design. As it went, it did not sound, but we have a truly multifaceted and complex film that can be adequately perceived in several different planes, and the maximum effect will be achieved only if you are able to look deeper.In the not too distant future, humanity is at a stage of regression: high technologies no longer worry us as much as the primary need for food. The farmer's profession becomes one of the most respected, and the craft is not easy, because for certain reasons nature is no longer our friend - one by one the whole vegetable crops are destroyed, refusing to yield crops. Against this background, the former pilot, and now the farmer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is invited to join an expedition designed to test potentially life-worthy planets in another Galaxy, the passage into which, in the form of a so-called 'wormhole', was recently discovered in our Solar System . While the expedition is busy searching, Dr. Brand (Michael Caine) here on Earth will have to complete his research and development, as a result of which he plans to find an effective way to transport the world's population to a new home. But if suddenly he does not find it - on board the interstellar ship there is a sufficient stock of the terrestrial gene pool to start the population 'from scratch' - this is not an iridescent version of the development of events called 'plan B'. As a form in his latest work, Nolan uses a so-so, relatively speaking, 'fantastic' plot, in which, however, modern scientific research is much more than some fantasies of the creators. Without the second, however, it was not done either - but more on that later. At the same stage, it should be said that the script is really very tightly based on modern physics and currently existing theories, and uses a lot of scientific terms - so if you do not know, for example, what the 'event horizon' is, and why the measure approaching the black hole, time slows down - it makes sense to prepare yourself a little before watching the movie, so you can understand what the heroes are talking about.For all this physics and mathematics, of course, there are real human fates, feelings and experiences. The film is still at the beginning, before the departure of Cooper devotes a long time demonstrating family interactions - but there, in the 'ordinary' terrestrial environment, this looks quite ordinary. However, as the story develops, the emotions and factors that generate them gradually take on a completely different form - here Nolan already tangles this tangle consisting of imperfection of our psyche, instincts and feelings towards others much more densely. In the emotional aspect, the film turns out to be very strong - without any conventionality or falseness. It is here that one of the most memorable scenes that produces such an effect is due to the breadth of the talent of the magnificent McConaughey. After it there is no doubt that the viewer will stay with the hero until the end, at whatever cost. Nolan allegedly opposes the cold soulless cosmos to the warmth of real human feelings, emphasizing their significance. In this regard, I would like to note that the culmination and its justification will probably not be understood by all, since here the plot departs from the science trail, it goes, in the literal sense, to the unknown - without spoilers it is difficult to say more, therefore, I just recommend not to take this allusion literally, and focus on what it means. It is also important to read between the lines and see things in perspective - and then you can see where as more logic than it might seem at first glance. But there will also be an ambiguous finale, leaving behind mixed feelings, and infusing a new subtext to where it would seem that everything has already been laid out on the shelves.
'Interstellar' amazes with its multitasking and coverage of the topics being raised. To some extent, this is also a minus, because the ideas embedded in the script, would be more than enough for three or four films. From this, it is not always perceived exactly, and at some moments even requires some effort and concentration when viewing. But in a decent way to accumulate so much food for thought in one movie, even three hours, by force of units. Not to mention how effective the picture works on the upper outer level, combining visual and sound images. Visually, the film is completely different from modern digital blockbusters: shot on a film and with real scenery, it generates an absolutely unique atmosphere. The same goes for the sound series - Zimmer clearly caught the mood: the sound is old-fashioned, unorganized and bright. This surprisingly deep, beautiful author's cinema is the long-awaited odyssey of Nolan, which remains in memory for a very, very long time.",9,74,142,4 June 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Cinema about hope and search for justice
","The drama of Martin McDon, known primarily for his ability to violate the foundations of modern drama, can easily be considered one of the best in the outgoing year.In the center of the picture is the mother of the deceased girl, seeking justice and justice in a rather cynical manner and the unquenchable hope for which is the meaning of life, along with a single son and a worn blue overall.'Where is the cliche?' - I thought, and already on the 10th minute of the movie I stopped speculating about the development of events and trying to predict the replicas and actions of the characters. This unpredictable plot was not in my memory for a long time, considering that all the events taking place for nearly two hours (and there were an unlimited number of them) surprise with their surprise and sometimes absurdity.The non-linear structure of the film makes the viewer systematically ask the question, 'What will be the end?', But 'What will happen tomorrow?'. The same question is asked to themselves and all the characters: the divorced mother Mildred, who is already desperate to find justice, ultimately lives by today and actually loses the intelligible for herself and for the surrounding purpose, humiliating the policeman and accusing them of racism, sexism and other ' '. Sheriff Willoughby, who learned that he has cancer, does not know what will happen to his reputation after his death. The sheriff's widow does not know what will happen to her daughters. The assistant to the sheriff Dixon sits up his pants and reads comics, having no motivation, no prospects, nothing.The appearance of three billboards in Ebbinge literally leads this small town into a rage. The hunt for Mildred is accompanied by violence on the screen, both from her side and from her ill-wishers (scenes in the dentist's office, as well as in the advertising firm). Even the church involved in the scandal gets gets on the forehead of Martin McDonagh, who calls her 'a criminal group' and 'lovers of little boys, and in general, boys.' The whole town shows all the dirt, like a fish, rotten from head to tail, stinks of hypocrisy.Thus, the unyielding willpower of the heroine Francis McDormand and her motivation, which at some point is questioned, makes the actress, perhaps, the main nominee for the Academy Award. And the abundance of all sorts of characters (including the hero of Sam Rockwell), well-designed, but sometimes fantastic scenario and satire on acute social problems (racism, sexual harassment, police lawlessness, etc.) make the Three Billboard reflect modern disgusting reality and valuable ( if not the most expensive) coin along with Bruges and the Seven Psychopaths in the treasury of the talented Martin McDonagh.Bravo, McDonagh!",9,103,185,5 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The most romantic episode of 'Star Wars'
","The second episode of the new trilogy of 'Star Wars' was much better than the first. He is much more gloomy, eventful and full of the sense that soon the customary world will collapse ... Moreover, it can be considered the most romantic film of the saga - speech, of course, about the love line of Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala performed by Natalie Portman. It is not only very well developed, but it also takes place mainly in very beautiful, blooming locations, which is generally uncommon for Star Wars. Even sad to realize that it is waiting for a tragic ending ...In all other respects, the 'Clone Attack' can be considered a good film. Excellent battles on light swords, skirmishes, long conversations and flights on space ships - all this is done very qualitatively and interestingly. There are a lot of really unexpected plot twists, which will be appreciated not only by the fans of the universe, but by all the rest. For example, when a small dwarf Yoda takes a lightsaber in his hands and almost starts on an equal footing with the formidable Count Dooku, perhaps everyone was surprised ...However, in spite of this, the second episode can not be put on the same level as the classical trilogy. And it's not even the quality of performance, but the fact that those films evoked much more emotional response, they had the notorious 'Star Wars magic', which is practically absent in the first two prequels.However, watching the 'Attack of the Clones' is worth all fans of fiction - these films are shot too rarely.",8,115,174,4 June 2018
Ant-Man," The smallest superhero
","Undoubtedly, each of us in childhood had favorite superheroes that we admired. They were in demand and needed, because they always taught a good cause: they clearly demonstrated how to be persistent and strong; how to overcome difficulties and obstacles; To reach heights and conquer new horizons; be able to love and offer a helping hand in a difficult moment; and most importantly - to remain yourself, soul and heart. Such acts and good deeds invariably evoked feelings of pride and enthusiasm, and it was so attractive and tempting that they could not help imitating them - fluttering like a smoke out of everyday everyday life and moving towards a huge peace, in the name of his own salvation. Sometimes it happens that patriotism prevails over soulfulness, and after all the lofty and ambitious, at times haughty and arrogant projects about superheroes, I want to take a break, to look at something that is not burdensome, unconstrained, perhaps even modest and simpler, closer to my liking. Following the loud and sensational 'Era of the Altron', the company Marvel, provides just such an opportunity, providing in his universe a place of an Ant-Man, whose name is not so popular and known as other heroes, but nevertheless, it is needed for the purpose of a full set , and also for the completion of the second phase of this very carnival.The man-ant. In the past, he was Dr. Hank Pym, now - burglar and thief Scott Lang. People do not shout at all, do not shout out his name, they do not sing praises in his honor, but the gifts given by Pim, in particular the reduction in size, clearly stand out Scott on the background of other superheroes, and, of course, find an interesting and fascinating application for themselves. Scott is far from hopeless, like many others, he also has his advantages, in fact skillfully breaks through protective mechanisms. In the same virtuosic way, Marvel draws parallels between the tiny world of the Ant-Man and our ordinary. This is the highlight of the picture, where from a daily routine, such as the running water in the bathroom, the movement of insects, there is a really exciting show that does not get bored, at least because of its novelty and uniqueness. Ants who are a friendly team, attract a lot of attention, manifesting themselves from different sides, and to discover and discover something new and amazing in its own way is always pleasant.
Without opposition and struggle, the whole picture does not lining up, so you need an opponent, who is a pupil of Hank Pym - Darren Kross, nicknamed the Yellow Hornet. And yet, it is worth noting that in the picture of Peyton Reed there are no strictly negative characters, there are only people who have lost their way. As a matter of fact, the Cross is the same, and its motives are clear and common, as well as Lang, Pim and others. If the 'Man-Ant' and stands out with some ingenuity, then only by that small world, and as to the decoupling of the plot and the characters - they are submitted in the most elementary and uncomplicated manner. Be that as it may, this does not affect the film, which, in addition to its wittyness, wins and due to a good actor's presentation. Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, together with their characters perfectly in harmony with each other, do not forget Michael Penny, with his funny character and funny gang, which makes a significant proportion of humor, due to his absurdity and absurdity.If you reproach the 'Person-ant', then only for the accelerated rhythm of the narrative, leaving in the end a feeling of unfinishedness and haste. Shortened actions and incompletely developed relationships experience the same sense of conciseness as the 'Altron era', but in this case, based on the above aspect, Peyton Read's film turns out to be more advantageous, perhaps because of the lack of trickery and sophistication . In addition to the fantastic, interesting and without exaggeration of the exciting world, the theme of love and family drama is touched upon. Love between the parent and the child, family ties are not just superficial, or for the species, they occupy an important place in the picture, which also gives an impression of a small share of its dramatic and soulfulness. 'Person-ant' can be safely called the most real outlet, against the backdrop of great pathos and excessive heroism. The film is light, casual, pleasant, sometimes ironic and funny. He will certainly find his place among other Marvel projects, thereby expanding his cinematic universe even more.",8,93,169,13 June 2018
Captain America: The First Avenger," 'Captain America - all hysterics' ©
","For a long time I did not write reviews with sarcasm. So the skill is not lost for long ... And just then a worthy candidate came out - the concentration of Pathos in it is the same as the calories in the cake.A bit about the previous set of pictures. When gangsters ravage America, masked people begin to clear the streets and return the money of depositors to savings banks. When in America there is a desire at least somehow to take part in the European military conflict - masked people make landing operations into the deep rear of the enemy, demonstrating that only the star-striped forces know how to fight. Actually, the original idea: we have a very correct morally and physically strong soldier, and you all hide behind his shield - safely migrated from the old comic book into today's movie.It's fun to watch how the directors mask political agitation. Even the name removed the post with a residence permit. As if to the Russian spectator who is not in the tooth with his foot, what kind of 'Avengers' are out there for 2012, it's not possible to reach the Wiktionary. No, in advertising materials it was necessary to move as far as possible 'Uncle Sam', which in the film is so much that it becomes ridiculous. Eloquent posters 'I want you', ten pieces of proud flags, a song and dance number in support of morale - but with emphasis on the strong will of the rickety 'simple guy from Brooklyn,' he is recruited by the international (from the continent to the subject) , and the plot is torn down, before reaching May 45th. Why was it so easy to blame and reduce the degree of humor? Ideal picture for the final tape: SC, accompanied by a company of elite handsome Americans, thundering the Berlin bunker of Hitler and killing him, forcing him to listen to the US anthem.
Then the template story would fit perfectly: the evil nehrist finds an ancient and powerful artifact (the top of originality, right?) And tries to direct its power to the destruction of the old world. Massively stamps Tesla-guns, power tanks, mopeds, submarines, 'stealth', the first tests are conducted on the sagging superiors, and all this for a couple of weeks at seven military sites scattered throughout Europe. The production is multi-purpose, since there is nowhere to screw the workpieces - the main hero attacks the bases, breaking everything down to the foundation, and, most importantly, the workshops are always ready to explode. But everything in the factory is environmentally friendly - it burns, it flushes, but no carbon monoxide is released, and the heroes breathe normally, they talk (super-people, yes, they can not).The main villain has a clearly worked out plan based on a technology that no brain can comprehend. There is a legion of soldiers, whom I can only call 'stormtroopers'. So stupid and harmless for the protagonist of the Nazis was not even in the 'Indiana Jones'. Here, at the first appearance of the correct guys with guns, they pretend to be hoses and stacked in stacks. The first assistant is ready to pass strategic plans for a plate of food. Is not it brilliant idea that a bad supermund in his lair to his soldiers pushes a speech in English? After all, they will soon be imbued with those great ideals of their underground organization.Generally funny inconsistencies in the movie car. A single submarine sailed behind a group of bad saboteurs (and logically, all but one were shot in advance). In the newspapers there is a picture of the hero with the door from the taxi, which, given that the cameras of the 40's is not a modern figure, but the tables on the legs, and the action-scene lasted about fifteen seconds, no one could do it, especially so clearly.Usually actors engaged in comic sets, even to praise for nothing - they just serve time in the frame. But this time a pleasant exception - the basic composition of familiar surnames perfectly rasproboval comedy stuffing tape and tried not to spoil it. Chris Evans was supposed to play a warrior with a code of honor and a sympathetic heart, and he qualitatively makes a frozen face in a heroic setting, but thaws with facial expressions and gestures during dialogues. Haley Atwell is responsible for the romantic component (symbolically arising after the acquisition of the hero pumped biceps), and in the romance the main thing is to look good. Therefore, the case is bright red lipstick and other mandatory make-up, successfully diverting the viewer's attention - it does not matter to him that in places the emotion is not reached to the level required by the stage.Shikaren Hugo Weaving with his falsh accent, which, most likely, will disappear in dubbing. Yes, if it remains, the voice will still not be the same, but it was the voice of the Australian that 'animated' Agent Smith from the 'Matrix', Megatron from the 'Transformers', 'V' from the same neonoire ... The main villain will lose a lot when localizing, alas, this inevitably - we will only have to look at the red computer face (well at least only from the second hour of the film). Tommy Lee Jones noted in the role of a kind and adequate colonel, in the view of which there is always a sparkle 'yes, yes, I understand everything'. Stanley Tucci and Toby Jones appeared in the image of German geniuses, separated by the front line, and Stan Lee ... Well, he as always, somewhere in the picture appeared for five seconds.
Three-dimensional graphics ... Music ... It was all, but it was not created as a separate layer of glaze, but as a cellophane package - just like a package that does not deliver any pleasure. It's not necessary to go to 3D, except in scenes where a round shield flies along a closed path, it's not impressive. Understand where the good, and where the 'storm troopers', you can and on a simple screen (thanks to the sane operator and sane editor). According to the stylistics, the stellar composition, the absurdity of everything that is happening in the frame, the tape is very close to the Cobra Brooch, and even closer to the League of Outstanding Gentlemen. So with the preliminary assessment (go / do not go) I recommend doing a retrospective on these pictures, and also not to lose sight of the fact that all this is a preparatory stage for the 'Avengers', where already there will be solid berries ... Continuous cloudberry ...",8,108,185,8 June 2018
The Godfather: Part II," The summit of Everest
","The second part of the family crime saga about the mafia of the Corleone clan was an event that was widely celebrated in the cinema. In particular, six Oscar awards and a recommendation of prestigious cinematographic universities where our VGIK enters, but the main thing is not this, but that after forty years this film is watched and is still being revised, and in terms of staging a frame and accents, many contemporaries have much to learn from the maestro The Corypoles. As far as I heard, the director was not going to be engaged in the second film and the studio had to make concessions, in particular in the history of Vittorio it was partly to address the source, and the story of Michael's becoming as Godfather had to be fully compiled. I finally looked at the second film and I want to share my impressions and thoughts on this matter.The second film was no less a legend than the original, not only having earned a well-deserved viewer's success and recognition of the members of the American Film Academy, but also entering the history of cinema as the best 'sequel' of all time, in a number of polls - even bypassing the brilliant first picture. It was with the 'Godfather, Part II' began the general fashion of assigning continuations in the headings of serial numbers written in Latin or Arabic numerals.Coppola and Puzo deliberately sacrificed the dynamic development of the plot, placing a stake on 'epic breathing', amazingly conveys the scale of personalities - a special kind of titans, from each decision whose lives depend. Even the Griffith principle of the 'cross' installation comparison of the vicissitudes of the fate of the founder of a powerful family who fled from his native Sicily and with great difficulty conquering authority in America, and his heir does not contribute to an increase, so to speak, the speed of rotation of the flywheel of History. The denouement is constructed in such a way that, inevitably recalling the final frames of the original, holds, rather, the opposite thought. The next cycle does not end, when you almost physically feel the change of the 'spiral coil', which knocks everyone: from the exiled Coroleone rivals to the last close person, eliminated for the committed treachery. On the contrary, everything returns to its own place, as if an unperformed prophecy is being fulfilled, or the Fate enters into rights, allowing for the time being to be illusions about free will. The final turns into a start, the ghosts of the past briefly come to life at a festive family table, and Michael's strong words sound even more dramatic and naive, outraged by his father's agreement with Tom Hagen: 'I have my own plans for my future.' Further - silence ...At the same time, the first and second (as well as the third, released after a decade and a half) parts are not so much refuted as complement one another. The authors, as if expanding the initial socio-philosophical premises, are no longer limited to analyzing the actual functioning of the mechanism of the mafia 'family', even significantly increasing the scale: forcing Michael to defend honor at hearings in the Senate and acquainting himself with the international interests of Corleone, as if it is a full-fledged transnational corporation. The opening of the sources of the power of Vito Andolini, on the one hand, based on the centuries-old patriarchal traditions of Sicily, proved to be stronger and more effective than modern state institutions, and on the other hand acting under pressure of circumstances, adapting to the brutal realities of the poor New York quarter. However, it can not be considered a coincidence that a memorable musical leitmotif permeates inexpressibly disturbing notes, accurately warning of the omnipotence of Rock.
From the interesting is also the concept of unfolding two plot layers, where in parallel with Michael is shown also the history of the formation of Witto, in order to better show us the father's features in the son, and the son could show the paternal character. The evolution of the mafia is visible in a huge conglomerate that has engulfed the whole of America and many infrastructures are in their hands, these people have a huge influence on politicians and other power-holders. From the philosophical point of view, this film is about how difficult it is to become an independent leader, how to show that you do not attach yourself to the glory of the Father, but you yourself are able to make weighted and complicated decisions. In this respect, the drama of Michael Corleone, whose marital status at first was shaky, and the other clans conceived the evil, worked well ...Actor's works leave no doubt that before you the screen life, when the human pain is reflected on the faces of the actors. Al Pacino is great in the role of Michael, the warm heart gives way to the pragmatism inherent in the Head of the Mafia clan. Young Vittorio performed by Robert de Niro was able to show charm and become the future of Don with him, too, there were many events that change character. All the actors here are in unity and show how it is necessary to plunge into the role, in all to see a lot of work for what each of the actors thank you very much.Verifying: A great movie that is recommended to watch everyone as an example of clear, competent and well-coordinated work of the creators' team, the whole mechanism works like a clock and as a result of hard work we get no less legendary film, somewhere even ahead of the original. Timing mastodon (202 minutes) does not interfere with perceiving history and imbued with the content of the saga. Such films are not at once to understand their greatness and strength to be reviewed and analyzed, but this film (like the whole trilogy) should not pass you by. All good and pleasant viewing!",8,78,144,3 June 2018
Dunkirk," Wars do not win by evacuation, but in this very salvation there is a victory © Dunkirk
","A talented boy named Christopher was not indifferent to cinema since childhood. His first 'home-movie' he tried to shoot, barely ten years old, armed with his father's 8-millimeter camera. The main roles in the first 'movies' of a small fan of the 'Star Wars' were played by the toy soldiers donated by the father (unfortunately, the permanent companion of Christopher's film career, Michael Kane, at that time was 'intercepted' by Richard Attenborough for filming in another war movie). Almost 30 years of persistent directorial work. 9 full-length films, each of which is not familiar with the rental fiasco. Total fees of more than $ 4 billion for all work and a 'loud' name. In the age of glory sin can not remember youth? And so, in the jubilee project, 'Dunkirk' - Christopher Nolan returns to his first 'director's' experience - military history. Only 'soldiers' this time - not a toy.Taking your favorite 70-millimeter film, a lot of natural scenery (minimum digital recording and green screens, gentlemen, only old school), loyal comrades (Zimmer, Van Hiteim, Crowley, Smith), and got several working 'Spitfires' and 'Messerschmitt', Christopher says: 'I want to shoot a visually beautiful movie.' And in Dunkirk he did it in his corporate style - with the inherent color effects a la 'The Dark Knight', the epic scenes of air battles, the sinking of ships and the endless 'bombing' that look no less qualitative than the fall of Cooper in Gargantua or a scene with a wave in Interstellar. But this was clearly not enough. And Christopher Nolan proclaimed: 'More realism!'. Operator Hoyte Van Hoytem should not be repeated twice. He unhooked a 100-kilogram IMAX 3D camera from a suspended tripod and, in an old-fashioned way, took off all the 'ground' scenes from his shoulder. Voila, 'Dunkirk' becomes the first film where IMAX shooting was done 'by hand' - the work received a lot of realistic scenes from the face of desperate British troops, filled with panic, Nolan confirmed the title of 'experimental film-maker', and Van Hoite moderately missed the gym . Ideally.'Dunkirk' is a screen reproduction of the famous in the history of Great Britain operation 'Dynamo'. In 1940, nearly 400,000 discouraged allies (mostly British) were pushed back by the German army to the small French port city of Dunkirk, on the English Channel. In conditions of total economy of military resources, involving civil courts, Great Britain begins the largest rescue operation. Christopher Nolan offers us his vision of these events and gives us a chance to look at them from three angles. Firstly, from the air - on behalf of the pilots of the Royal Air Force, at all times seeking through the strait to help their associates. Secondly, from the sea - on behalf of the crew of a small civilian ship, which is also sent to Dunkirk to assist in the evacuation of the British corps. And, thirdly, on behalf of desperate soldiers, who are eager to survive and get home, at any cost.
Christopher Nolan, in spite of his fears, was inspired not by the Spielberg story of the salvation of Private Ryan and not even by Stoun's 'Platoon', but (!) 'Nonstop action' - 'Speed' and 'Unmanaged.' The genre of 'Dunkirk' smoothly balances between the 'vigorous' thriller and worthy 'war-movie', and the suspense - just off scale. In addition, the director immerses us in a non-linear narrative, saturated with flashbacks and endless action in the spirit of the film 'Remember.' We can observe the picture of the bombing of the shore from the land, and in a few minutes - the same scene, but already from the fuselage of the Spitfire.A few words about music. Oh, the seventh was scorching. Hans Zimmer, are you human? From the very first minutes, the soundtrack began, which did not end at all until the final credits, alternating only its tempo. Due to this, 'Dunkirk' looks in one breath, in the truest sense of the word. I do not want to go into a detailed description of the impressions - I just wait for Zimmer's music to be called the classics of the 21st century.But fans of the deep 'Nolan' story are waiting for the sad news. In 'Dunkirk' the director, not wishing to go beyond the historical framework, relied on reliability and coverage. There is a minimum of metaphoricality, a minimum of a unique fantasy, a minimum of understatement with respect to the plot and a maximum of understatement with respect to the characters. Calling the main character (Finn Whitehead) by the name 'Tommy' (if we collectively called the Germans 'Fritzes', the Germans generally called the British 'Tommies'), Nolan seems to seek to 'generalize' and project on his fate and feelings the experiences of all who was in this situation - to create the effect of an impersonal mass. All this reminded me madly Remarque and his 'On the Western Front without Change' - a real war, without 'superheroes' (and was it not for this that the 'eminent' cast was slightly overshadowed?), Impregnated with despair, a thirst for survival and whistling bullets from an invisible enemy.Caesar could simultaneously read one text and dictate another. Walter White - at the same time teach chemistry and 'cook meth.' Well, and Christopher Nolan damn well knows how to combine the position of a talented screenwriter and an unrivaled director. And, perhaps, he once again proved it.
'Dunkirk' is the tenth, anniversary work of Christopher Nolan. 'Powerful' historical film with an invigorating suspense and dizzying visualization. A minimum of digital effects, a maximum of material props and 'cardboard' decorations - a balm for the soul for all fans of the 'old school' of cinema. Unfortunately (or not), the 'genius' of the play played to the detriment of the 'uniqueness' of the script - the fans of 'Beginning', 'Prestige' and 'Interstellar' will definitely wait for some disappointment. In all other respects, the signature handwriting of the master of a large-scale movie is felt in every minute of the time-keeping.You will like this movie, ladies and gentlemen, rest assured. Enjoy watching!",8,161,279,5 June 2018
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Mischief managed!
","The third film about the young wizard is the most controversial, for it was he who split the fans of the novels about Potter into two warring parties: conservatives and innovators.The first group of fans absolutely condemned and condemned the actions of the director Cuaron, altered 'Harry Potter' in his own way. Say, they did not like the strange werewolf, all sorts of jokes-jokes, interspersed by the director in addition to the script, and in addition to all the claims they discovered the disappearance of the atmosphere of magic, because of which the popular expression of 'Quaron in the furnace' was born.The second group, on the contrary, furiously began to praise Cuaron, extolling him to the unprecedented pedestal of fame, thus creating almost a cult of personality. They liked everything that only they could like in the third film.Only now it became clear that both sides are not right in their convictions. So it should be, movies must be different in essence. The error crept in from the very beginning: Chris Columbus took the first two films, and this put the old debate on what kind of movies Harry Potter should be about. Columbus did not have to give the right to shoot two films, and one would suffice. Spectators are used to the atmosphere of the first two films, because most of the audience took the innovative approach of Quaron to the screen version of the third novel with bayonets. Now the producers make a mistake again - they give the right to shoot two films (The Order of the Phoenix and The Half-Blood Prince) to the new director David Yates. This should not be done in any case. It is necessary to preserve the diversity of director's visions. Hogwarts is not accidentally depicted in different ways in films, like Hogsmeade. Everything in novels is seen differently every time, because all the reader and viewer sees through the eyes of Harry Potter, and in films through the prism of the director's vision, the viewer must perceive the magical world through the eyes of a young wizard.
Alfonso Cuaron still hit the spot with his timely vision of the plot of 'The Prisoner of Azkaban.'He created a sparkling tragicomedy for the growing up of a young wizard.In general, Cuaron's film reminds me of our old Soviet films. For the reason that the whole film can be easily taken away on the shots, quotes, fragments, heroes, soundtracks, etc., etc.
Despite everything, this film is much kinder than the previous two, differing in their gloomy Gothic style. It's more fun, crazy, and it should be, because it's Sirius Black himself on the scene!For the whole of Rowling's novel, like the film of Quaron, is a tribute to the memory of the crazy, hooliganistic and such lonely Sirius Black ... Black, whose heart is beating violently, hot blood flows in his veins, and in the soul is truly dog devotion.
The third film, as well as the film, is dedicated to the looters - James Potter (= Harry Potter), Peter Pettigrew, Rimus Lupine and Sirius Black - a group of friends who used to be friends a long time ago ...The film ruthlessly shows how easy it is to lose friendship and how difficult it is to acquire a friend ...Thanks to Alfonso Cuaron, who did a talented work, showing in one stroke all the huge gallery of the characters of the magical world and their essence: the Minister of Magic plunges into a puddle; the soothsayer with big glasses on her nose stumbles on her own table; The evil teacher Severus Snape closes the children from the werewolf; eccentric Dumbledore slams his hand over Ron's gnarled leg; Remus Lupine, at the lesson, takes a snack with an apple; portraits of Hogwarts, it turns out, also like to sleep; Stan Shanpike with his brave words is not very strong in dragging student suitcases; Hagrid and ties are incompatible things; Tom from the Leaky Cauldron has a nehyl auto; Ernie, wearing spectacles with large lenses, is led by the 'Night Knight'; Sirius Black finally began to talk moral nonsense ...
Also it is necessary to thank the new actors, so successfully merged into the old line-up:Emma Thompson (Sibyl Trelawney); Michael Gambon (Albus Dumbledore); David Thulis (Remus Lupine); Julie Christie (Madame Rosmerta); Gary Oldman (Sirius Black); Timothy Spall (Peter Pettigrew) and many others. By the way, if my memory does not change me, then the two actors from the third film (cleaning woman in the bar 'Leaky Cauldron' and Aunt Marge) Quaron quietly consigned to his other project - 'Child of Man', but that's another story ...Let me love the fourth film about Harry Potter (director - Mike Newell), but I always revise the Curaron part - it is the brightest of all existing.In a word, long live Rowling and Cuaron!'Potter, come back!' (Severus Snape, potions teacher).",9,88,99,5 June 2018
Captain America: Civil War," Split of the Greatest Heroes of the Earth
","Split of the Greatest Heroes of the EarthThe film 'The First Avenger: Confrontation' is the second loudest film comic this year, which tells us about the battle of superheroes against each other, after 'Batman vs. Superman' and is a screen version of the comic 'Civil War' - one of the most significant and large-scale events in the universe comics Marvel. As always, Marvel made a great movie. What did I like about it? Explain in order.1. The plot. In 'Confrontation' the plot turned out to be very interesting and, most importantly, not trivial. It is difficult to determine until the very end which of the heroes is right and who is not, and even if you have taken some position, at the same time it is difficult not to understand the other side of this conflict. In this story, every hero, every team is both right and wrong. In the struggle of heroes, everything can not be clearly divided into black and white, and in this contradiction there is a huge plus of the plot of the picture.Humor, although it's not so much, is still present and remembered. Especially, in this regard, the scenes with the Person-Ant and the Spider-Man are strong.Also very pleased with the final of the picture, which turned out to be as contradictory and ambiguous as the confrontation itself.
2. Characters. Heroes and their motives are revealed in the film quite full and do not make them doubt. Of paramount importance are, of course, the leaders of the warring teams - Captain America and Iron Man.The captain does not appear to us as an ideal hero, but a man who is compelled to go against all to protect his friend and the ideals in which he believes.Iron man is also shown somewhat differently, he believes that all heroes need control and are ready to obey a new law, which, he believes, will be able to protect the world from new dangers.Among the new heroes is worth mentioning the Black Panther, who plays one of the main roles in the film. For him, the film is like a test before his own solo project and we get about him only an initial presentation.Of course, one can not help noticing the Spider-Man, who personally for me was one of the main reasons for going to the movies. The spider turned out really new. It's hard to say whether he will be the best of all previous ones, but I can say with confidence that he is already sharply different from his previous incarnations, largely due to the fact that the role was taken not by an adult, but by a real teenager. Separately, it is worth mentioning and the voice of the character, the voice reflects perfectly that the hero is just a child and an inexperienced superhero who is just starting his fight with Evil. In my opinion, the filmmakers correctly decided that they did not once again show the story of the origin of the character, but present it as a ready-made hero.The new villain Helmut Zemo turned out to be very interesting and memorable, thanks to the fact that he is the most ordinary person who managed alone, using only his mind and hatred, to resist the Avengers. It will be interesting to see this character in future films as well.
3. Action. Action, as in any film on the comic books Marvel, is one of the main components and here he, as usual, at the height. I have nothing more to add here.In the end, before us is one of the most successful films of the cinematic universe of Marvel, which allows us to take a fresh look at familiar characters and leaves us in a pleasant anticipation of future films.",9,112,199,13 June 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Again a fight, but bigger
","I went and looked, and I want to express my thoughts.I went to this film with very high expectations, with a sense of something. I went to him twice, the first time, myself, and the second with the family, and I was even surprised that my mother, sister and dad (who do not understand this movie at all) brought unreal pleasure and an ocean of emotions.Each frame, each scene does not let you get bored, from the Marvel logo, and to the stage after the credits. Favorite heroes once again experienced side by side and you feel it, you are completely absorbed in a hurricane of events and you are watching it in one breath. In comparison with the War of Infinity, even the Confrontation looks like an ordinary fight in the sandbox.Uuuu, and the villain, the best as for me the best in this kirovoveselennoy, he is not just a bot at once, without motivation, no, it's just the opposite. I liked Thanos so much that you do not want to, and he began to impress me, in terms of his convictions (I had it only once, with Joker Heath Ledger). He has feelings, he makes choices, he's alive.Tense scenes are beautiful, in one moment I still let off a meager male tear (and this happens to me very, very rarely). What about the humor, the jokes are correct for me, and they do not bother you like Thor: Ragnarok, although in the beginning they look a little tight. Well, the action, it is very high-quality, and in comparison with the Black Panther is generally ideal.And of course the film can not be without punctures. The lack of predictability of some story lines, and a couple of moments that were very predictable, but they are fade against the background of all this scale.Yes, you will not find anything in this film about something, something, but, what, what, what, steep humor. Thanks to Marvel and of course the Rousseau brothers, the beautiful actors and the wonderful movie that I've been waiting for for 3 years.Out of 10, I give the War of Infinity 9.",9,533,1158,3 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Time of the last
","Many were waiting for the continuation of the legendary saga 'Star Wars'. They put their hopes on him. And now it came out. Direct continuation of the seventh episode reached the audience, but did it justify expectations?The script of the film is very rich in events. There are many plot lines and actions that play a key role. On the one hand it's good, because the film does not let the viewer get bored, but on the other hand it prevents the film atmosphere from completely being imbued, because the editing very often ends at the most interesting moment. This 'serial' reception seems not quite to the point, and the film is perceived heavier than we would like. Although in general, the characters were allowed to reveal themselves, with the possible exception of Ray. By the end of the film, it remained the same as it was in the beginning, while other characters developed in one direction or another. Although Daisy Ridley played her character at the highest level, there was still a lack of progress and internal changes in the heroine. The timeline of the film was a record 152 minutes, but they look not so difficult, although during the film very often you are in a tense state due to a large number of twists. All these twists are very well developed, which is amazing. Throughout the movie, you do not know which way the plot will turn, and at some point the film makes you realize that everything will not go as you thought. The episode turned out to be rather gloomy, but nevertheless it included a proprietary Disney humor that was not always there, although jokes were ridiculous. In general, all problems do not reduce the number of positive emotions that you receive from viewing.The director's work of Ryan Johnson has borne fruit. His film turned out to be above the 'Awakening Force' by Jay Abrams. How does Johnson behind the back of the series 'In all the heavy', which is undoubtedly one of the best in the world series. And in general, this time, 'Disney' more responsible approached the continuation of the franchise. To the music of John Williams there are no complaints at all. It perfectly emphasizes the atmosphere of the 'distant-distant galaxy', which is very pleasing and winds up memories of the old parts. In general, 'The last Jedi' very much resemble the fifth episode, only with new characters. It's understandable why the studio does it. The young generation, for the most part, does not perceive the first films, so the studio tells the old story with new heroes who may become favorites in the future for the new franchise audience, but they do not forget about the old fans, trying to please them, like JJ Abrams episode, but while they do not quite get it.Actor's work in the new film is also impressive. The line of Kylo Ren in the performance of Adam Driver is very good. Throughout the film, we see how his character develops. Unlike the previous part, in this episode the son of Khan Solo can rightfully be called a full-fledged antagonist, and not a hysterical teenager who very much wants to look like his grandfather Darth Vader, but he does not succeed. Actors 'old man' Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, too, look quite organic. The images of unbreaked Leah and Luke's lost hope fit perfectly into the plot. Young actors quite deservedly can count on the fact that they will love the new fans, but on all their background I would like to highlight By Dameron in the performance of Oscar Isaac. This brave rebel, who is ready to sacrifice everything, even his own life, for the sake of the 'Resistance' perfectly figures in the plot of the picture. Although in terms of some characters and the question arises: 'Why are they in the movie?' - It does not spoil the impression of the acting game. I hope in the future will explain their appearance, otherwise it is unclear why there was a need to include them in the script, if you could do without them. And the High Leader Snowk also failed to live up to expectations. He does not reach the level of the teacher of the Sith, as, for example, Darth Sidious.Special effects and action scenes in the movie are also good, though sometimes they sometimes get tired of them, but still it does not take away the beauty of the film. The picture is full of beautiful frames and it has an elaborate fauna of different planets. To be honest, I really liked the animals that are presented to the film. Make-up and costumes also deserve praise. Thanks to all this, the film looks very nice, and many scenes are perfectly stored in memory because of a good and high-quality picture.Personally, I liked the whole picture with all its problems. Of course, new films have something to strive for, of course. But progress in comparison with the previous part is felt. I hope that 'Disney' will stick to this path and eventually make a film that can compete with the first six parts.",8,197,341,2 June 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," A pleasant surprise, or how I stopped being afraid and again fell in love with blockbusters
","Recently, I began to understand that I was tired of blockbusters: these incredibly spectacular, voluminous, incredibly expensive, but by and large similar to each other and empty films. In 2014, apart from bitter disappointments like the 'New Spider-Man 2', there were really standing copies (whether the new 'X-Men' or 'The Face of the Future'), but they also failed to arouse my special trepidation. And that's why I did not expect the 'Guardians of the galaxy'. And if it were not for my long-standing affection for the Marvel universe and the invitation for the preposition, I probably would not even have gone to this film and ... Much would have lost!During the viewing of 'The Guardians of the Galaxy' I was surprised at the fact that it was gradually becoming ecstatic. I could not imagine that I can still empathize with screen characters and laugh at their words and deeds. This film really gave me back the love of blockbusters and revived the hope that in the film world of fiction it is really possible to do something new and unusual.And now I will try to briefly note those components of the film that bribed me the most.1. Cool plot. This tape contains several storylines, which, due to the abundance of central characters, are revealed as completely as possible. The main action is twisted around an artifact, which everyone abducts from one another. However, developing this storyline, the creators of the tape have time to give us and a spectacular escape from prison, and many spectacular interplanetary battles, and the history of the formation of a real strong friendship between the five main characters. The plot develops very rapidly and practically does not sag, keeping spectators intrigued to the very titles. Personally, I would have sopped the melodramatic part of the film, however, the reaction of the viewers to these episodes was absolutely normal, so it's more of my harmfulness and natural cynicism, and not some miscalculations of the writers.
By the way, the film itself is more associated with 'Star Trek' or 'Star Wars'. So not special lovers of the Marvel universe can appreciate this tape.2. Excellent humor. 'Guardians of the galaxy' is a very funny film. And the cool thing is that here there is a place of self-irony, as the tape makers coolly ridicule various clichés peculiar to blockbusters. In general, it is necessary to see and hear. Probably, this is the most cheerful film of this year, although according to official information it is not even a comedy.3. Team spirit. I remember two years earlier I was choking with enthusiasm, praising the Avengers precisely for their team unity. However, one can not help but notice that in the Ironman and the company the team spirit was a little bit pretentious. The heroes were constantly measured ... hmm ... by forces, and the friendly atmosphere was relegated to the background. In the 'Guardians of the galaxy', things are different: the characters are so different that they have nothing to compete with. This five of the losers (and they call themselves that) form a real friendly union, which more than ever realizes the principle 'We are different, but we are together.'In connection with the above, it makes sense to mention the work of a stunning cast of actors. Chris Pratt creates a very bright character who can compete with his own charisma, even with Tony Stark himself. It's amazing that I did not pay attention to this actor before: after watching, I was surprised to find that I already watched a dozen films with his participation. Now I will follow with interest the development of his career. Zoe Saldana confirms the status of the most unearthly actress of our time, adding to her track record a new alien image of the charming and daring Gamora. Professional wrestler Dave Batista is very organic in his role. I think he definitely has a future in the film industry. Very pleased with such venerable professionals of their business as Benicio Del Toro, Glenn Close and John Ci Riley, although, not soon, that these fantastic actors would like to see on the screen a little more.
Rocket Raccoon is also a rocket (or for many of the fair sex - milash raccoon) - this is the main bomb of the whole film. I can not appreciate the work of Bradley Cooper, since I watched the film in Russian dubbing (which, by the way, is also surprisingly very good). But the character is simply amazing! The hall came in a raging rapture, it cost the raccoon only to appear on the screen. Definitely, this is a find without which this film would not have been so successful. Spectator love was won by another character - Grut (or, again, for many girls and children - just a Tree). By the way, the incredibly laborious work of Vin Diesel on the voice acting of this character you can appreciate in Russian dubbing.4. Bright special effects. What to say, the film is bright, very beautiful and voluminous. A real holiday for the eyes, on which it is worth to fork out, in order to appreciate all this beauty in IMAX 3D.5. Music! Even if the film leaves you absolutely indifferent, then the music just needs to please you. The creators of the ribbon collected just the cream, the quintessential culture of the 70s, choosing bright, favorite, but un-played tracks. I was really pleased to share some of this amazing culture with my friends who, outside of this movie, would not for anything agree to listen to 'this is not necessary for old people'.TOTAL. 'Guardians of the galaxy' is a completely crazy blockbuster that charges the audience with a positive and undoubtedly captivates with an incredibly warm atmosphere, exciting plot, bright special effects, killer jokes and a genuine team spirit. For the first time in a very long time, I felt this naive childlike feeling: I did not want to leave the cinema and leave this amazing, incredibly convincing and soulful world, which was given to us by the creators of the 'Guardians of the Galaxy.' Probably, this is the first blockbuster this year, which I will want to reconsider. And this is the rare film that I want to assess neither from the point of view of a critic who cares at trifles and searches for story inconsistencies, but from the point of view of the viewer who can easily be bribed by a talking raccoon and a smiling tree.
That's why I highly recommend watching this movie literally to all viewers. And that's why 'The Guardians of the Galaxy' is becoming a movie that I without any qualms of conscience put an unprecedented 9 points, which I have not been awarded with yet another film from the universe I adore Marvel.Enjoy watching!",9,109,183,13 June 2018
Jurassic World," Nice film)
","Twenty years ago, people decided to play with evolution and resurrected long-extinct species. The amusement park, where the main attraction was dinosaurs, was to be a hit, but became famous for its tragic deaths. After a while people decided to give a lucrative idea a second chance, and here appeared the 'World of the Jurassic period', offering visitors an unforgettable family vacation. But how much safer is it than its predecessor?Return to the big screens of great and toothy was just a matter of time. The story was too good to leave her alone. Inspired by a new life entrusted to director Colin Trevorow, who himself is a big fan of dinosaurs. He decided to show how he could bring the insatiable and out-of-control desire of humanity to be constantly entertained. In pursuit of money and new impressions, they bring out a new species, never before stepped on our planet. What can go wrong?The characters of the film, especially as for those who work in such a dangerous amusement park, where accidents happen all the time, are mostly too careless and narrow-minded. The owner of the island does not know at all what is being deduced in his laboratories, the security system operates only when the animals behave decently, one wants to write down as a matter of fact the wild raptors to serve in the army, and children can easily escape and during an alarm to stay alone on the field among dinosaurs, because the employees of the attraction are too busy saving their skins and incompetent to the limit. And what to do, when a huge dangerous predator of a new breed escapes, nobody knows at all.Well, that on the island works a certain Owen, who almost only understands that dinosaurs are living creatures, not toys. Chris Pratt's play here is pretty plausible, especially its interaction with the raptors. In the light of rumors that he might become the new Indiana Jones, it was nice to see him in a similar image, which he is very much following. The Pratt company is Bryce Dallas Howard, for whom this is the next vivid role after the 'Servants'. She has her own moments and potential, but it feels like the writers specifically held her back so that she did not become equal with him, preferring to keep her heroine in the shadow of Owen. By the way, the only actor from the original was BD Wong, who again embodied Dr. Henry Wu.'The world of the Jurassic period' is clearly aware that it is simultaneously the continuation of the original, and the restart of history, which should breathe new life into the franchise. To the very original, creators reacted almost with sacred trembling, references to 'Park' are found throughout the entire film. There is even a character-geek performed by Jake Johnson, who seems to be the embodiment of the fandom.Steven Spielberg, of course, put his hand to this continuation of his prehistoric brainchild, but only as an executive producer. Together with Trevorow and the huge team behind the creation of this blockbuster, we are going to an island where many would like to visit, despite the deadly danger in its cages.The dinosaurs themselves on the screen impress with their realism. When raptors appear, it's like seeing old and almost kind friends. With them, there are a lot of great moments, in particular their communication with Owen. Their joint pursuit, depicted on the poster for the film, is one of the most exciting moments of the franchise. But the most impressive episode is the final battle of dinosaurs. I was delighted with who the writers were instructed to save everyone from the new predator. The original is always steeper than any remake.Continuing 2 hours, this adventure will not let you get bored and will please the dinosaur lovers, who opened their mouths with surprise and delight at viewing the 'Park'. The plot of 'Peace' is based on the idea that formed the basis of the original: people played in the gods. Heroes again create what they can not control, and then pay for it. It would seem that it is time for mankind to learn from its mistakes, but, judging by the history, we often do them again and again. And the creation of dinosaurs is far from the most serious of them.Crossing the types of the most dangerous dinosaurs, it is worth to be prepared for the fact that family rest on such an island will turn into a chase for survival.",8,182,285,7 June 2018
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Quality of manual assembly (Simple opinion about 'Avengers: Age of Ultron')
","At the moment, 'Simple opinion' certainly will do without the husks and garbage. If that's all Weedon cleaned, then what am I? Number ninety-eight, 'The Avengers: The Age of the Altron'It seems that in advertising, neither the cinematic Marvel, nor their apogee - 'Avengers' certainly do not need. Especially, the second part of them. But, if you somehow managed to distract / not notice / or just sleep in the ice of the Antarctic for the last twenty years, then the easiest way to describe what you are going to is to go to the amusement park. At what this is the second, improved version of this, which came last time.The only claim that can somehow put up the 'Era of the Altron' - the presence of the previous film, which though not on purpose, but leveling part of the effect. Nevertheless, we have already seen something similar, and we approximately know what to expect. A group of diverse heroes forced to unite for the common goal, a charismatic villain at the head of a crowd of faceless clones ... It's not that we would not see it, or we did not want to look again ... And it looks like Joss Weedon knows all the pitfalls in itself a sequel. It is no longer necessary to tell the stories of the main characters (just like last time, actually), and we do not even need to disclose the reasons for their interactions, and therefore the movie tells the stories of the characters who were deprived of attention last time. Altron is a jerk, he sings songs, runs over himself and avengers, sincerely not understanding why they are needed, if he is - all such in vibnium. And the Scarlet witch and Mercury, having lost the status of mutants, contributed a huge share of diversity to the action and history, not to mention that there are not many sympatians in the frame.The narrated story serves as a flip bridge to the further development of the cinematic universe, but it was done in a large and effective way, being a worthy continuation of the first part. Joss Weedon thus secured us with you, yourself and the co-owners of the need for the third part and the story of the same story for the third time. Wisely, considering that the history of cinema has repeatedly proved that the same approach in a trickle does not work in ninety-five percent of cases.
One way to hide the roughness and surpass the original is an action, and it was brought here with a surplus. Beginning exactly with what the original ended - the interaction of the Avengers as one, one-piece team, shown by one shot, the second part thus hints that there will be even more. And, believe me, 'The Age of Altron' does not disappoint, and the viewer will receive a huge amount of beauty and effects, the performance of which is honed in all the previous parts of the universe. Well, we will not forget that this is Marvel - there will be plenty of humor, and even the hammer of the torah will become a real joker.The second phase of the cinematographic universe is coming to an end, and the result of its evolution was presented to the audience. This is no longer a novelty, but no one promised, honestly on the heart. 'The era of the Altron' - an ideal blockbuster, which is the result of the development of entertainment movies.This is not a streaming production, it's not an attempt to keep up with someone, or to prove to someone something - it's a one-off product, quality and collected manually. Not creativity, not invention, not art. Quality of manual assembly, that's all.",8,93,170,13 June 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Family cosmagogue
","Today I dedicated to the Guardians of the Galaxy. I remembered the contents of the first film and got acquainted with the second part, which placed a great emphasis on the drama of characters and family values. With this text, I will try to orient you to watching this movie, because despite the fact that the film, though done by the templates of the first part, even stylistically and graphically turns out to be the ideological continuer of the first film. James Gunn stayed at the role of the project to revive the popularity of forgotten heroes, which by two thousand and fourteen already no one remembered. The second series promised to be bigger in many ways, but could it? Let's understand!Guardians of the galaxy angered the sovereignty of the Sovereign, their heads are hunted by space pirates, the ship is broken, and the team nearly cried to death. But there is no evil without good: The Star Lord met a long-lost father named Ego and learned the story of his origin. Because of which the Guardians again have to save this galaxy ... Synopsis is good, catching and logically coming out of the first film. The main question disturbing many: the second part was better or worse than the original. And here already from which side to look.'Guardians 2' are made at the same high level as the first part. They are as spectacular and funny and, perhaps, even more ambitious and touching. There is everything that should be in the film about the Guardians: a lot of humor, space battles, dizzying action scenes and music from the seventies. And, of course, Stan Lee's cameo and Howard's ducks.But what's in the continuation there, so this is at least something fundamentally new, at least some serious differences from the original. 'Guardians 2' is not a sequel like 'Terminator 2' or 'Aliens', raising the series to a new level, but just another portion of adventure in a familiar style. It can be compared with the next episode of the series, which is no better and no worse than the previous one. And he loses only because he is not the first.
Still, the first 'Guardians of the galaxy' was a terrific surprise. Nobody knew what to expect from the film about little-known heroes from the comic books Marvel. Nobody expected that a talking raccoon and not quite speaking tree would become symbols of 2014. And what to expect from the second 'Sentinels', everyone knew, and this is what they give: 'Pirates of the Caribbean Space.' Parallels between the two Disney franchises and the truth is a lot. Space pirates behave exactly like the team of the 'Black Pearl', and the Raccoon raccoon with its antics makes us remember Jack Sparrow. Well, Peter Quill reminds Will Turner, who finally found his lost father. And absolutely not how I expected.James Gunn did not deceive, saying that the main theme in the film would be the theme of the family. She touched not only Peter, but also each of the Guardians. Gamora finds out the relationship with her sister Nebula and serves as a caring 'mommy' for dunces-muzhiks. The rocket (do not call it raccoon!) Actually becomes a father for Little Grunt. Even Drax the Destroyer, which in the first film seemed almost superfluous, was revealed due to the fact that he found himself a pair. He flirts in a friendly way with the fragile empathic Mantis, and their joint scenes have come out touchingly awkward and comical.Characters and parallel lines in the sequel became more. To the cast was added Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone (and David Hasselhoff flashed into the cameo). The composition of the Guardians themselves grows, and they will look more than the Avengers. It is felt that it is harder for Gann to come up with memorable remarks for everyone and from time to time he gives slack. This is especially noticeable in jokes: sometimes they roll down to humor below the belt, and not an adult, as in 'Deadpool', but some school. When a raccoon threatens to throw a fecal to a friend, when the great Kurt Russell has to joke about his huge penis, it does not cause laughter, but awkwardness. Such moments can spoil the impression from the first half of the film.
t is better where the director succeeds in the scenes, where humor is born from the action itself. As an example, any scene dedicated to Little Gruda is suitable. He does not say much, but everything he does, whether it's trying to get friends out of captivity, dancing during a battle or careless handling of a bomb, turns out touching and hilarious. If the slogan of the first part was 'Especially the raccoon', then the second would come up with the slogan 'Especially Little Grut'.In 'Guardians 2' there is already no magic spark of novelty, which caused such enthusiasm in the first part. But this is a competent and qualitative continuation. The scale has grown, the characters are better exposed, and jokes and memorable scenes would be enough for a few more films.Verdicting: The movie turned out to be excellent, it has a smart picture, intelligent thoughts (the dialogue between Drax and Mantis about love of freaks and beautiful ones was remembered) and moments of non-stop dynamics with colorful explosions and blasters, in the best traditions of the new 'Star Trek'. Of the merits: Yonda, Drax and Little Groot are well exposed, they really experience for them throughout the whole film, enchanting spectacle and jokes above the belt that have a place to be. From not very successful: jokes below the belt, ill-conceived villain and lack of novelty, but about the last point you forget completely, because you are immersed in the cinema with your head, because it tightens. I advise you to watch two films at once - the picture is more complete. All good and pleasant viewing!",8,95,174,5 June 2018
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," ...Welcome to magic world
","The breeze stirred the neatly cut bushes of Tisovaya Street, silently lying under the ink-black sky. Of all the streets in the world, this street was the least suitable for amazing events. Harry Potter turned in his sleep. A small hand groped for it and squeezed the envelope. The boy was asleep ... '(c)June 30, 1997 in the light came the debut of the writer Joan Kathleen Rowling. Literally such words began to become great, a series about a small wizard, with a scar on his forehead. The story that absorbed the minds of adolescents around the world, as it was said in the press '... a book that can tear boys and girls away from TVs and computers, return it to the house from the street ...'Just imagine...'A dull, dank, dark night. In the street a storm. The little boy lies on the floor of his 'room', in a small shack and draws a finger in the sand with an inscription, 'Happy Birthday, Harry!'. The cry of the soul, he knows that no one will congratulate him, no one will affably caress the top of his head. In a minute he will be eleven. Ten seconds ... Nine ... You can wake Dudley - just for laughing ... Three ... Two ... One ... A loud knock at the door, there's no knock, just a crash. There was someone behind the door, and he was obviously going to come in. 'I think anyone will guess what happened next. Good-natured giant Hagrid, told Harry the striking news that he is not just a boy with a scar on his forehead, but a real magician.A short word about the actors.HarryWhat to say, there would not be Harry James Potter, there would not be the book itself. Whatever happens in the books, I was always entirely for his character. In the first part, he's just small, you can even tell a confused boy. All situations, difficult fights, intricate situations, are still ahead. Now he just scooped up this great knowledge - magic. The first real home, first friends, first classes, the first meeting with this evil, he is experiencing all this in the first part.
HermioneHermione Jane Granger is my favorite female character in the book and film. In it, I see a part of myself. Hermione loves to learn and she pays a lot of time. Sometimes she is too arrogant and excessively proud of her success in her studies. Born of a muggle, so often heard the offensive word 'Mudblood' in her address. Hermione is just a smart girl, how many times she has yet to pull friends out of difficult situations.RonRonald Bilius Weasley. Redhead. Already this word can give some characteristic. Ron is the sixth child in a wealthy family of hereditary magicians. Always the elders took on everything superior to Ron, be it study, sport, or female attention. Arriving at Hogwarts, gets to know Harry, the same situation is repeated as with the brothers, but he reconciles with his second plan. Whatever it is, he remains the best friend of Harry and Hermione.I wanted to say that the whole trio was exactly the same as it was represented by millions of readers in the world. Actors took absolutely unknown, but this film made them real little stars.The movie has good enough, more famous actors, the same Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Julie Walters and the inimitable Richard Harris. His death was just a blow to all the fans, his Dumbledore seemed to come off the pages of the book, the same wise look from under the half-glasses, gray hair and beard, hooked nose. He inspired a kind of majestic calmness, every appearance on the screen calming. By the way, I do not consider Michael Gambon a good Dumbledore, he turned out to be some kind of crazy, but this is not on this topic.
It is quite possible to write now a complete retelling of the book / movie, but you know, absolutely do not want to. Joan Rowling created an amazing, magical world, thanks to her, millions of boys and girls began to look for a scar on their foreheads and with impatience and hope to wait for their 11th birthday. And I'm certainly happy about how Chris Columbus embodied this idea on the screen, the fairy tale turned out to be absolutely childish, very bright, joyful and for some reason the word Christmas comes to mind, although there is not so much Christmas there.Children's dream came true. Harry found his friends, his family, found loyal defenders, but he does not even suspect what he will have in the future. However, it will not be soon, but now enjoy watching!Dedicated to: all those who are ready to go with Harry to the end.",9,78,90,5 June 2018
Thor," Thor: The Mighty Avenger
","It remains only to marvel at the company Marvel, which gives an impressive amount of money for the implementation of films on their comic books under the guidance of 'newcomers' in the genre of 'summer blockbuster.' Four years ago they did this with John Favreau, who previously filmed family comedies and yet surprised many with his 'Iron Man'. Now, the honored actor and director of the dramatic cinema and theater Kenneth Brana demonstrated miracles by taking off a large-scale fantasy comics epic.ActorsChris HamsworthTaking advantage of the tested scheme (to take on the role of the protagonist of a little-known actor and surround him with 'loud names'), Brana did not lose. Chris Hamsworth is the perfect Thor! Possessing not only impressive physical training and memorable appearance, Hamsworth was able to convey the power and emotions of this character. In some places it is threatening, in places it's funny when it's necessary to be gallant. Yes, and in general, throughout the whole movie you penetrate to the Torah sympathy and you empathize with it.Natalie PortmanAs always, she is charming and charming. The first falls on the Torah and runs after him all the remaining time :)Anthony HopkinsWorthy performance of a worthy role. The first experience of Hopkins in the film kinomics was a success.Tom HiddlestonSly, a jealous manipulator. Another one hundred percent hit in the role!Jamie Alexander, Ray Stevenson, Joshua Dallos, Tadanobu Asana and Idris ElbaWell-written characters, which should still be given a little more time, because each is interesting in its own way.
ActionIt is many, it is diverse, large-scale, beautiful, impressive and fascinating. The best episode is the battle of the top five warriors with the Ice Giants and a huge monster.Special EffectsLooking at the trailers it seemed that the 'Thor' would not be particularly pleased with the special effects, for both the monster's drawing and the Torah's hammer in action were not so impressive. But fortunately, the effects brought to shine and you can with full confidence to say that the 'Torah' is the most grandiose special effects from all the films Marvel.LocationsAh, this Asgard! He is beautiful! Incredibly beautiful and the viewer is not satisfied with the monotonous views of the city. In each of Asgard's places shown, there is something unusual and unique. And the more interesting are the transitions from the deserted quiet town of New Mexico to the majestic palaces and structures of Asgard throughout the film.MusicPatrick Doyle has proved since the time of 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' that he is an excellent composer, skillfully combining different musical styles. The 'Torah' is mostly dominated by pathos and heroic music, but in times of dramatic moments, sad compositions play.HumorHumor in the film is not as much as we would like. But he is funny and in no way slips into jokes below the belt. True, it would have been more ridiculous to beat the scenes of 'God Tor in the modern world among ordinary people.'PlotEnough fun and interesting without obvious stupidities and sagging. Although Torah's 'rebirth' was worth paying more attention.SurprisesIn the film, a lot of Easter eggs for fans and attentive viewers. Starting from the most obvious (mentioning the Hulk and the Iron Man), ending with the hidden ones (Falcon eye). And at the end of the final credits, the audience expects another bridge to the upcoming 'Avengers'.Undoubtedly, the most beautiful and grandiose film Marvel. Excellent entertaining summer movie. Satisfied should remain both the audience and the fans. I want to wish the studio to continue making films about my superheroes with the same love and warmth.",8,120,195,8 June 2018
The Shape of Water," Love
","As the director of the highest class, Guillermo del Toro showed himself at the beginning of his career when he happened to put a charming Chronos and truly frightening 'Mutants', which allowed the Mexican master to gain a foothold on American soil and continue further creative research. Each film del Toro, whether it be frightening mysticism, horror or screen adaptation of a graphic novella, has a powerful emotional charge, profound reasoning and breaking any barriers by the power of love, to which the director has a special relationship. Invariably putting his hand to writing the script, the director does everything necessary for the veil of special effects to reveal the true feelings between intelligent creatures who understand the true value of relations between loved ones. For del Toro, it is not important what kind of love grows in his paintings. It can permeate the relationship of a man and a woman, or vice versa, have a strong kinship. Value has only a manifestation of its essence in all sensual beauty. And then even the most impenetrable gloom retreats to the side, leaving only light on the review, which it is not possible to overcome other feelings. 'Hellboy', 'Labyrinth of the Faun', 'Crimson Peak' and other author's achievements del Toro always attracted special attention from the audience. When the director could bypass the intrusive attention of producers, a truly unforgettable show comes from under his hands. The same is the 'Form of water', a rich, catchy and at the same time delicate work that keeps us in suspense until the very end.So, the plot of the film unfolds in the early 60s of the last century and introduces us to the silent cleaning lady Eliza Ezpozito (Sally Hawkins), who managed to get a job in a secret government laboratory. Having found herself far from the city noise and a society that she can not accept the way she is, Sally is sitting out at work all day long and tries to do everything necessary to avoid paying too much attention to her. And let the work with the mop and buckets do not bring her special pleasure, the heroine finds time to delve into her own thoughts and create in the imagination a wonderful world in which no one else can penetrate her. Having no close friends, much less a lover, Eliza tries to look for joy in sheer little things and for a long time nothing foreshadowed the rapid development in her personal relationships, when suddenly the girl seems to know the most important secret around which the secret laboratory's activities are built. It turns out that under the care of the sinister Colonel Strickland (Michael Shannon) is a sensible amphibian (Doug Jones), an unknown creature trapped in a closed reservoir and amenable to constant experiments. Accidentally meeting with the marvelous creature with a glance, Eliza suddenly realizes that this meeting is far from accidental and it is quite possible that a feeling arises between it and the amphibian, which can not be designated otherwise than love. And when it becomes known that the underwater guest faces a deadly danger, Eliza will not sit aside, since for the first time in her life she has found a soul mate and is ready to sacrifice everything for the sake of her salvation.
'The shape of the water', undoubtedly, stands out with special importance against the background of the other works of Del Toro, since it was born at the moment when its creator had already visited the peak of universal adoration, and then dabbed the reputation with ambiguous projects and decisions that called doubts. But for all his creative mistakes Del Toro not only did not lower his hands, but became only a more perspicacious and skilful creator, who with each new work is put more inspired and restless. Seeing us in the world of brutal servicemen, unfortunate cleaners and innocent magical creatures, the master used the motifs of classical drama and tragedy, surprised with serious emotional strokes and was not afraid to demonstrate strong feelings with all the staging power that not only amazes but also frightens, Like a real horror film. And in order for all the elements of the 'Formula of Water' to converge, Del Toro needed exceptional actors, able to revive his characters and create experiences that would not have to be doubted. Fortunately, his idea interested only in respectable performers who could easily abandon a large fee in favor of serving the arts.Sally Hawkins, the confident and sought-after actress, who rarely trusts roles in big blockbusters, of course, became the soul of this film, but her talent and ability to get used to the images gradually becomes legendary. Agreeing to embody Del Toro's fantasies in life, Hawkins played a strikingly sensual role that attracts maximum attention and makes her soul sympathize with the tragedy of the unhappy girl's relationship with a creature from a different world. In turn, a good friend of the director, Doug Jones, was no less brilliant party to match Hawkins, and thereby allowed the actress to reveal the full range of dramatic experiences through the impeccable performance of the image of an amphibian man who caused in a dumb beauty a storm of unprecedented emotions for her. For obvious reasons, we again do not see the true appearance of Jones, but he has repeatedly performed in front of the camera a variety of strange creatures and in the 'Formula of Water' reached the apogee of skill, after which it will be difficult for him to play a piercing role.In the end, I want to say that the 'Form of Water' tells us a love story that is simple and yet unprecedentedly beautiful and soulful. Guillermo del Toro shot the film the way he himself wanted and thanks to this 'Form of Water' looks like a really chic authoring film.",9,325,610,5 June 2018
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," The first milestone. Sinister mystery of Hogwarts.
","'... The magical power that came to Joan Rowling from a different world, pulls for itself, and the book is read in one breath.'
Book Review, December 18, 2000The second book about the adventures of the young wizard Harry Potter world waited impatiently. And finally, he waited. 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' appears before the reader's eyes with a bright and original work. Of course, it relies on the first book, but it remains individual. 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' - a darker and more terrible book, unlike the first. So became the film. But the film and the book have not lost their charm and easy immediacy. It's still the same kind of fairy tale about the fight between good and evil, where good will certainly win.The magical world of Harry Potter has not changed. All the same oblique streets of London, the splendor of Hogwarts, the Forbidden Forest with its secret inhabitants, The slanting alley, the eerie Lute Lane, the unfriendly Rattling Willow, the huge school yard, the stunning quidditch. All this was preserved and was moved by magic wave in the second film, only slightly transformed. Hogwarts is a bright and active participant in all events. This castle, which became home for Harry, is no less important character than our young hero. Hogwarts carries in itself tying knowledge and great wisdom. This huge, majestic building knew a lot in its time. And all its secrets, its architecture and attract the eye.In 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' we meet the amazing and frightening creatures of the magical world. Dobby's elf is very cute and funny. In such a small, frail body is hidden a wide soul, suffering in vain. He does his best to protect Harry from danger. But Harry Potter, like a magnet, attracts them. Favorite animal Hagrid turns into an unpleasant monster - a giant giant spider Aragog. He is wise, old, but does not inspire confidence. And on top of everything, the mighty, dangerous serpent Basilisk appears on the screen. There are many legends about this snake, and Joan Rowling decided to add it to her epic. And, in principle, not in vain. He inspires reverence and horror, but at the same time a frank desire for Harry to finish him off quickly. Another amazing character in the film is Phoenix Fawkes. Amazing bird flown from the pages of the book to the screen. She is an ancient mythical creature, dying and rising from the ashes. It reminds us of the eternal cycle of life and death.
Special effects in the film, in other ways, as in the first, not at altitude. But even seeing a few implausible spiders and a snake, you believe everything that is happening on the screen. The magical, mysterious, magical and frankly amazing world of Harry Potter draws and you just do not want to return to reality. Chris Columbus, who became the director of the Potters for the second time, could not lose the charm and atmosphere of the first film. Just the movie 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' became more sinister, frightening and full of dangers.Characters have not changed. Bright, alive, emotionally embodied on the screen of their heroes magnificent English actors. The cold and tough Potions master Severus Snegg performed by Alan Rickman, the same adamant Minerva McGonagall, the wise director of the Hogwarts School Albus Dumbledore (the eternal memory of Richard Harris, who died three weeks before the premiere of the film), the kind-hearted forester Hagrid. Pleased with new characters. Lucius Malfoy performed by Jason Isaacs is cruel, adamant. It just blows something negative and extremely unpleasant. Zlatopust Lokons is the life-builder, reclining on the laurels of others. He turned out to be too sugary, pretty, I would even say sugary. And, undoubtedly, the actor Kenneth Bran is on top. His character, or rather his performance, is very ironic.
The unchanged trio of the main characters remained the same. Harry Potter is the star of the magical world, the orphan boy, who grew up in disgusting muggles, displays remarkable courage, desperation and determination. The one with which courage he rushes into battle, you can just envy. I'm torn by internal contradictions, his similarity with Lord Voldemort, his knowledge of the snake tongue. He is afraid of all this. And Harry desperately tries to understand himself. But when you need to become a hero, he is ready for this, because he is a hero in the full sense of the word. He is ready to give his own life for others. Is this not the highest manifestation of heroism? But Harry does not boast of it. And this is a huge plus to his character.'I'm sure that Mr. Potter will always be there to save us.' - 'Certainly.'
Lucius Malfoy and Harry Potter.Ron Weasley remained absolutely the same except for the character. He transformed, becoming better. His behavior towards Hermione, when she was insulted by Draco, calling her a Mudblood, his courage in the Forbidden Forest among not one hundred spiders, whom he fears until his death, causes respect and approval.Hermione Granger is still the same smart girl with a lively mind and a great intellect. She is very natural and sincerely wants to help others. With her character there are certain metamorphoses. Hermione clearly ceases to be such an avid guardian of order.'We are badly influenced by it.'
Ron Weasley, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.
Tom Narvolo Reddle is the past of the cruelest magician of the magical world of Lord Volan de Mort. This character is interesting with his striking resemblance to Harry. They are like halves of one whole. Harry has collected all the good and positive, in Voldemort everything is bad and negative. They are very similar, but they are very different. The choice. That's what makes Harry the way he is and distinguishes him from a dark magician. Choosing Harry to live the life he wants. His choice.'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' - a magical, mysterious, full of magic, amazing and terrible creatures canvas director Chris Columbus. For the second time we stepped into this unique world full of mysteries and terrible discoveries. Music, Gothic entourage, Hogwarts and unchanging heroes in the fight against evil: welcome to the magical world of Harry Potter, created by the hand of a fabulous storyteller Joan Rowling.",9,73,79,5 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," This is war
","May 19, 2005 was not a simple day for fans and fans of the 'Star Wars'. It was a day when all pieces of history fell into place, finally opening a riddle that lasted more than 28 years. People imagined and thought out, wrote books and stories, collected facts and made legends, and everything for the sake of one saga, which will forever remain in the hearts of its admirers. Probably, almost every person, leaving the hall, could not convey or describe in words, what happened during these several hours in the cinema. Joyful, sad, tearful, shocked faces, slowly headed for the exit, promising to come back and see this episode again.This is the chapter of history, truly the most intense and the most powerful. It penetrates into the lungs, not allowing to breathe, touching hearts and souls. We are just spectators. But we can experience. And at some point, there is only a doomed sigh, realizing that there is no way out.Indeed, the third episode is the most cruel and tragic. There is much more pain and despair in it than in any other part. Here the republic collapses like a house of cards, turning into an empire, the Jedi perish at the hands of their 'single minded', and the face of Anakin Skywalker forever hides the black helmet of Darth Vader. And all this inspires horror, the horror of hopelessness, when you slowly begin to understand that all this is only part of the plan, the way of a petty senator to a ruthless emperor, where everyone is just a pawn, in a huge game of the big world. And every word said accidentally becomes the key to this great puzzle, which accompanies the imperial march. But when you realize it, it's too late.'I swear the faithfulness of your teachings,' whispers the future dark lord to his master with despair and devotion, asking only one thing - to save her beloved. At this moment Anakin Skywalker perishes, dies together with the republic, along with the Jedi, together with her beloved, giving birth to Darth Vader - the future tyrant, which inspires terror and fear, driven by hatred and despair, in the eyes of which something like love is reflected ...
And the most terrible thing was that it was inevitable. The Jedi themselves dug themselves a pit, while the enemy stood behind them, alternately, pushing them down. This is war. Order 66. The army of clones. Padmé Anakin. Alone, these errors are not so significant, but together they form a whole madness and panic, in one hour destroying everything that the galaxy has been working on for many millennia. Therefore here the absolute evil and absolute good unite in the struggle, this cinema and consists of some contrasts. Good and bad, the Jedi and the Sith, Obi-Wan and Anakin, the emperor and Yoda, Anakin and Padmé.Such a controversial character went to Hayden Cristian. In essence, he plays two opposites in one body. Nobility and sincerity at the beginning and anger and hatred in the end. And all fear began, which slowly grew into panic, then into despair, anger, getting to hatred. It was thanks to fear that the emperor firmly grabbed Anakin's soul, not wanting to let go of his new servant. The glitter of embittered eyes, in which hatred for everything and the thirst for power breathe. It is difficult to imagine someone who could better cope with this task. Therefore, there are no more words left than one: 'I believe'.It's all over, Anakin. I'm above you!The battle of Obi-Wan and Skywalker is what remains in memory forever. This is not just a battle between two people who have spent together their whole lives, this is a battle between two brothers who sacrificed their lives for each other's sake. Here, the side and skills of each are determined. Obi-Wan (in the brilliant, by the way, performance of Evan McGregor) does not try to follow the easy ways to achieve his goals. He goes to Mustafar, he understands with bitterness what is going on. Therefore, this battle is not only with the darkness, it is a battle with yourself, with your feelings and attachments. Unlike Anakin, Obi-Wan is firmly committed to duty, goals, order. For some reason, he is sorry for the most in the end. A person who, in any situation, acted as correctly, and not as easily.
At the same time, we see the battle of two other opposites. Yoda and the emperor. Here, the battle goes for other concepts, for democracy, peace and freedom. The fate of the entire galaxy is being decided. And as the swords are crossed, good and evil are constantly side by side, weaving and maintaining the balance of power, crossing swords, but achieving different goals.But where did it start? Padmé Amidala, without knowing it herself, is the center of the whole string and culmination that unfolds during these few hours. A tragic figure that unwittingly became the key to the empire, from which they simply got rid of unnecessarily. Natalie Portman, like no other, fits into a gloomy sweep and the helpless panic that reigns around. Her heroine is touching and ardent, but unable to change anything, she is only an outside observer of the war and the collapse of the republic.Painful and sad ...Most of the attention of the film is given to Anakin, whose fear and sweeping increasingly turns him into the ruler of the Sith. However, about the persecution of General Grievous, powerful battles and amazing planets, also did not forget. This is a movie that will not leave anyone indifferent. Yes, and whether to restrain feelings? After all, this legend, which will be remembered.Bravo George Lucas.The highest ball.",9,268,306,5 June 2018
Inception," A tool of hope.
","Have you ever felt like waking up from a dream to see its continuation? This idea disturbs Christopher Nolan ever since he was 16. Already in the future, as he developed this idea in his head, he was visited by another captivating feeling. And what if it were possible to study and manage the place of sleep? Now the British cinematographer is 39 years old, and the world has finally come to the opportunity to get to know what Nolan was so stunning, fast and loud all these years. 'The Beginning' is a sci-fi thriller about the architecture of the mind. If for some reason this has not yet become a reason for the strongest intrigue, it is never too late to recreate it.Philosophy of Nolan. It is simple and at the same time terrifyingly exceptional. Making your environment think like you. To share all the events happening together. Experiencing the same difficulties. Strive to hold together for the hands to achieve the impossible. Making unusual things happen in the usual way. The topic can be continued, and its brief description will remain unchanged. Any person with whom you work, whether an actor or someone else, will always be completely imbued with the material that you yourself wrote, if this material is perceived by every person at the deepest personal level.Fans of the series 'LOST' could have done the same thing with 'Star' as they did with every series of the popular, now in the old days, series. Probably, for a reason, at the end of the day, a percentage of people will be drawn, what from wild ecstasy after watching will obviously lose consciousness in the most positive sense? The name of the film company Nolan 'Syncopy' from the ancient Greek era means the medical term of fainting, loss of consciousness. I'm not talking about plot similarities with the term. And the logo of his film company, whose foundation happened in the year 99, has absolutely identical design as the 'Start' screensaver. In the picture, the characters Paige and DiCaprio get acquainted in the same place where Nolan once met his future wife and constant working partner. And this is not all 'Easter eggs'.
From the skyscrapers of Tokyo to the snowy peaks of Calgary, from the exoticism of the Moroccan Tangier to the picturesque streets of Paris, from historic London to modern-day Los Angeles. The scale that Nolan saw from the emotional journey of his painting could not fit in a modest framework, so the shooting process affected 4 continents and 6 so different countries.To make the dreams look as real as possible, the director once again followed his eternal principle and tried to maximally abandon computer graphics. Whether it's a revolving corridor 30 meters long built in Cardington, or the busiest street in Paris, mass explosions are caused by nothing else than nitrogen under high pressure. Impressive buildings in the Canadian Calgary provided work for thousands of local residents for six months. Their efforts could not justify themselves fully due to the fact that on approaching the crew to the place of direct filming, for a long time there was not much needed snow. He 'fell out', creating for the creators is another problem due to the fact that did not stop a very long period. Arriving in early August in Morocco, a big unexpected success for the creators was the acquaintance with the local team, with whose help Hollywood partially took off more than one blockbuster in the territory of this African country. And the street traffic of Los Angeles was cleaned by the railroad train, behind the wheel of which was everyone's favorite Jim Wilkie. The same guy who ran an eighteen wheeled wagon in the 'Dark Knight'. This is only a small part of what the 'Beginning' shakes.DiCaprio amazes us with one of the most difficult characters of recent times, which is largely due to the care and personal affection that Leo showed to Cobb. Together with Marion Cotillard, they create a screen couple capable of enveloping the soul of any viewer. I've never seen anything like it and close. The talented Hollywood youth in the faces of Page and Gordon-Levitt demonstrate a full understanding of the color range and levels of brightness of the characters assigned to them. Tom Hardy, performing the imitator, brought to the picture a significant share of charisma. And Killian Murphy finally embodied an image that has long been very curious to him. In May 2009, Nolan offered him absolutely any role, and he chose the 'Client'. And Ken Watanabe ... As in the case with the other images, we all will long try to disassemble this character, which is a very important and charismatic question for us. Each of his actors, Nolan asked not to tell anything about the plot, even to their families.Quite symbolic is the fact of the presence in the film of the song of Edith Piaf. After all, for the image of Edith Piaf in the film 'Life in pink' in 2007, Marion Cotillard received a statuette of Oscar for Best Actress. Hans Zimmer paid close attention to the creation of the track, not so much to the stunning visual component of the picture, but to the emotional world of the main characters. It's always evident when Hans is captured by the storyline of the picture for which he is going to work, and 'Beginning' is no exception. Filling the rich sensory undercurrent on the screen with a wonderful musical series, Hans did not leave behind his own imagination, allowing himself to go beyond the usual framework in the hope of looking where they would lead him. From here came the guitar, played on which none other than Johnny Marr of the band 'The Smiths'.
For any of us, there is a difference in choice, when deciding whether it is worth chasing us for a happy moment or total happiness as such? Also here. Despite the speed with which you develop on the screen a completely different action - you want to keep up with it. Our feelings are awakened in the most active ways because of the resource that causes in us a similar instinct to comprehension and further awareness. This tape is a symbol of the whole structure of our everyday perception of what surrounds us in the material and immaterial world. A symbol that is itself the architect of a bridge connecting two opposite sides.Incredible and colossal, difficult-procedural result of the most outstanding artistic production in all spheres of film production. A movie that will never leave your mind, demanding from you its regular revision. The movie, which you will discover with each new show for yourself in a new way. A mad, multi-level, impressive plot production, attached to the deepest actor images. Infinitely rich semantic context and visual component. All this is a combination of the greatest cinematic experience that Nolan dragged through all these years. He would never have become a director of N1 in the modern world if he were not true, loving his family by a man. And this is the most important thing. That - with what all 'Begins' ...A rare dream that survived so many years ...Film of the Decade.",9,100,178,5 June 2018
Black Panther," Wakand forever
","In such a multicultural society like the United States, it would be surprising if, sooner or later, in the pages of the popular comic book does not appear the first black superhero capable of on a par with Spider-Man, Thor and Iron Man to resist the threat of danger, experiencing the Earth's defense strength. There was such a significant event in the summer of 1966, when in the 52nd issue of the 'Fantastic Four' magazine, from the filing of Wall and Lee Kirby appeared the proud T'challa, Crown Prince of the fictional African country Wakanda. The emergence of the superhero with a characteristic color, traditionally incredible abilities and characteristic behavior could not get past the various ethnic groups in America and soon T'challa popularity reached unprecedented heights and rapid, then it without much thought in a row the team the Avengers. And in spite of the fact that the prince, and then the full-fledged ruler of Wakid, was only one of the knights of the image of the 'Black Panther', it was T'chall who became associated with fans of graphic novels with this character who had a great future ahead of him. Having firmly established itself as its own personal series of comic books, T'challa appeared consistently in so-called crossovers and even managed to lead a charming Storm under the crown, who agreed to become the second half of such an outstanding personality. In addition to participating in various kinds of print adventures, the hero repeatedly appeared in animated sketches from Marvel, reminding the audience that he is unique and can not be written off. And in the early '90s, when the shooting process technology began to show an unprecedented rise itself Wesley Snipes tried to present themselves before us in the guise of the 'Black Panthers', but constant creative differences and other production problems at the root hacked promising ideas. And yet in the depths of Marvel no one was going to give up the opportunity to transfer the history of T'Challa to big screens. Of course, it took much longer than Stan Lee planned, and yet the 'Black Panther' merged into a harmonious series of screened characters of the publishing house and rightfully took the leading positions in the Kino-Universe supervised by Kevin Feigi.Produced by Marvel for a long time tried to introduce T'challu an endless success story begun in Jon Favreau, 'Iron Man', trying as gently as possible to bring to build a mythology movie, the universe for a meeting with an idol of the black community. And the best option was the invitation of T'Challa to the conflict, called the 'Civil War'. Friendly confrontation between Tony Stark and Steve Rogers gradually grew into by a serious, albeit not the most dramatic battle, and T'challa fully demonstrated its unique features, trying to avenge his father's untimely deceased in eternity. Played quite remarkable and not untalented actor Chadwick Bozeman character exuded confidence and unwavering despite the deep emotional conflicts tormenting his soul, managed to find a balance, thereby demonstrating the wisdom that came too early, but the world needs, more than ever before. In itself, the plot of the Civil War caused ambiguous feelings among Marvel fans, especially if we compare the scale of events in the movies with what was happening in the comics, but T'challa did not raise any doubts about the expediency of his appearance, and therefore Kevin Feigi gave the go-ahead on the shooting of the solo output of the 'Black Panther' under the direction of Ryan Krugler, one of the most interesting directors with a dark complexion, who was obliged to feel with the history of T'challa kinship and show us previously unknown regions of the Movie Universe, to they are destined to play a significant role in the further development of the conflict under the sign of the 'Stones of Eternity'.
So, the plot of the film unfolds in a remote and closed African country Wakanda, which managed to reach unprecedented technological heights due to the myriad deposits of outlandish metal. Developing aside from the major world markets and, consequently, conflicts, Wakanda managed to preserve its identity and at the same time create an exemplary unity of the society in which conflicts start and are happening, but they can always be resolved by the affairs of honor. Entering the throne of a small but proud country, the young heir of the late King T'Chall (Bozeman) decides to continue the policy of isolating the Wakis for the benefit of their own people, never in need of anything, but events in the recent past compel the Black Panther to seriously reconsider their life position. The world was no longer as huge as it was some 10 years ago. Globalization, which picks up the Earth in a whirlpool of cosmic proportions, is also clinging to T'Challa's home, which among other things attracts scoundrels of various colors ready to sell their souls for the treasures and knowledge of the Wakid.Contrary to the specific geographical location of the 'Black Panther', it does not feel at all camera and alien. Ryan Krugler's ribbon fits perfectly into the framework of the Marvel Cinema-Universe, showing a charming and, of course, embellished African flavor for the joy of a few tired of the monotony of the previous series of films to the audience. The title character in the invariable performance of Chadwick Bozeman is revealed to us on the best side, demonstrating an excellent physical form and ability to win back emotions that make him a living person, not a schematic heroic character. The actor became the real property of the 'Black Panther', he skillfully plays out even the most difficult by the standards of Marvel dramatic scenes and manages to joke so that he is not ashamed of him. Of course, by the will of the fate of T'Challa has no right to be merry to the bone, as his country is torn by a serious conflict, but the game of Bozeman takes the hero out of the walls of gloomy reflections and volitional actions in order to show the true humanity of the 'Black Panther'. Thus, T'challa becomes almost the most interesting character of Marvel since the days of Tony Stark, and although there is not so much eccentricity in him, the hero completely takes the niche taken by Kevin Feigi. And the history of the 'Black Panther' is filed so competently that not only African-American viewers will be able to fall in love with it, but also a different category of viewers. And all because Ryan Krugler, Chadwick Bozeman and the unchallenged curator Kevin Feigi understand what they need to do. Certainly, the film has strong ethnic roots, only for a skilfully told story that in fact has nothing to do. Regardless of skin color, each of us has the concept of beauty. And the 'Black Panther' is proof that a tightly-shot movie will always find attention and become a favorite for millions.As a result, I want to say that the film by Ryan Krugler reveals wonderful beauties before us, reveals a serious layer of history, is not afraid of bold artistic decisions and at the same time gives Marvel audience a pleasant feeling of comfort. 'Black Panther' is colorful, spectacular and epic. It does not violate the laws and stylistics of the Cinema-Universe, which also pleases. Of course, the authors would not be prevented from taking a partial example with the permissiveness of Taiki Vaitichi, the author of the third 'Torah', but it is clear that Marvel is increasingly willing to trust the original vision of the directors and still give them the necessary sip of creative freedom. The Krugler tape is proof.",8,259,543,5 June 2018
Iron Man," In the Christmas room there were twins ...
","Tony Stark's life is the dream of any self-respecting man. He is incredibly rich, devilishly intelligent and in no less than superb degree is charming. He sleeps mostly with the girls who have been on the cover of Maxim, he drives exclusively on cars, under the hood of which there are not less horses than in the entire equestrian sport of any country, and the interview gives only sexy reporter, ready for a long, let's say a conversation before the first cocks. But one day, Tony's always sarcastic becomes a joke, he is taken prisoner by a group of Arab-terrorist appearance with the demand to 'make us such a rocket' and subsequently - to kill. Stark and his companion in misfortune decide that to lose hope in general and stupid, and begin to build right before the eyes of nothing understanding the invaders best of Tony's evening suits.It is always pleasant, when transparent as glass, aphorisms find a clear confirmation in our lives. So it happened with the phrase 'If you want to do something well, do it yourself.' The company Marvel, which owns the rights to all at least some decent heroes of graphic novels, was tired of how famously Hollywood turns her intellectual property into a shame, and took absolutely the entire production process under her control. The Iron Man is the first swallow of this approach, and it should be noted that the swallow has come out so fat that under it branches break.The fact that the stars heavily winked at the project is noticeable already for the one who plays the main role. Downey Jr. in Hollywood is considered an eternal loser because Robert is more accustomed to look at the world from a bottled bottom or through a mirror powdered with white powder. To make such a person a titular face of a multimillion picture, which would be nice to justify the budget, the thing is extremely risky. That you had something to compare, I will say that the production of HF on his shoulders by Robert is akin to the appearance of Johnny Depp in the role of Jack Sparrow in one little-known picture. That is, this is when a good actor becomes also successful, and the viewer from this only wins. A more charming and charismatic Stark can not be imagined. Yes, and in his opponents he is not anyhow anybody, but similar to Lenin's grandfather Jeff Bridges, pushing his villainous speeches with frighteningly realistic notes in his voice. Well, any appearance on the screen of Gwyneth Paltrow should generally be celebrated at the state level - it is as usual so nice that I want to directly coat it with my coat and take it by the handle to some more cozy place than the screen of the cinema.As the adaptation of a picture book, the film is immaculate. The dose of humor, action and serious non-pseudo-paraphonic dialogues were always on good pharmacy scales, and 186 million of the budget allow you not to think much about the quality of special effects. Such falsities and unfriendly relations with logic usual in such pictures are completely absent. The general message of the film reads easily: 'We had you, Hollywood,' and the main indicator is the phrase that ends the film. As Dreamworks once sneered in their Shrek over Disney standards, so Marvel tramples everything that was done before in the field of the genre.",8,66,128,4 June 2018
Thor: The Dark World," Second, but not in quality
","Honestly, Thor was never my favorite superhero. I liked the first film, but did not make much enthusiasm, and in 'Avengers' all my sympathies were given to Tony Stark. Therefore, 'Torah 2' I waited without much trembling. And if it were not for my love for the Marvel franchise and not the prerequisite on which I managed to visit, then perhaps I would not even have gone to the movie to film ... And I would have lost much! 'Thor 2' was just an excellent, incredibly exciting movie adventure. Unequivocally I can say that this film-sequel I liked much more than the first 'Thor'. The creators of the picture made a serious work on the mistakes, took into account many shortcomings of previous films and significantly raised the level of quality.In general, I was very pleased and pleasantly surprised. And now I will try to briefly describe my impressions, to reveal the pros and cons of this film.1. A fascinating and rather original story. 'Thor 2' is a film with a completely new, separate narrative. Formally, it is the continuation of the first 'Torus' and 'Avengers', although the main storylines with these films are not connected in any way. Describe the story - it's a thankless task, a great chance to give undesirable details. Therefore, I will confine myself to general remarks. Firstly, it is very gratifying that the plot of the film does not develop according to the scenario of the 'Renaissance of the Legend', according to which, judging by everything, practically all the fantastic films released in the last year were shot. Secondly, it's worth to praise the writers for the fact that the action develops systematically, powerful action scenes alternate with lyrical digressions and small humorous insertions - that's why the film keeps the viewer's attention for all two hours. Thirdly, I am glad that the film will not be delayed: everything is lively, bodrenko and laconic. Well, the last moment, which I wanted to comment on is the ending. For most viewers, it turned out to be very unexpected. As for the inconsistencies and some logical blunders, their presence seems inevitable for almost every fantastic film. Besides, in Torah 2 there are not so many of them (in comparison with the first film, at least).
2. Excellent graphics and special effects. Life in the 21st century taught me not to be surprised at anything. I do not know what special effects need to be invented so that in the current conditions they make a special impression. Therefore, 'Torah 2' I'm not going to consider from the point of view of sensationalism and some novelty. Of course, if I had seen a schedule of this level even five years ago, then it is quite possible that I would lose my speech. Today, this film is just dignified. All special effects are well worked out. From this position, this picture can be safely put on a par with the same 'Man of Steel', for example. There are, of course, individual details that looked excessively computerized and slightly unnatural, although for fiction it is forgivable. Of course, this tape is worth watching in 3D format, so as to maximize the effect of presence.3. Beauty! What not to take away from this film, so this is a beautiful picture. And for each viewer the understanding of this beauty will be very special. For example, the male half of the hall was fascinated by the unrealistically divine views of Asgard and really spectacular mass scenes. Their companions were much more interested in Thor himself, or even his material shell, which he actively demonstrated. Undoubtedly, all spectators, regardless of their gender and other characteristics, appreciated the beauty of the night sky, stars, incredible nature and architecture, which is abundantly presented throughout the film. A beautiful picture is accompanied by good music, which has already become quite traditional for the genre of fiction.
4. Friendly cast. After the 'Avengers', it seemed that the actors' ensembles of the subsequent crossover movies Marvel would look bleak and insignificant. It is for this reason that the third 'Iron Man' caught up with a bunch of actors who, in fact, played no special role in the development of the plot. In 'Torah 2', the main actor's skeleton was removed from the first film, and there were almost no new actors. Due to this, the screen does not create an overload in terms of unnecessary dialogues and unnecessary scenes, and the cast seems very friendly and united. Of course, the main thanks are due to Chris Hemsworth (who, incidentally, after the movie 'Race' has grown very much in my eyes). He easily becomes the center of the film, brilliantly copes with all the tricks, comfortably feels in the costume of Thor (which is said to be terribly uncomfortable) and perfectly interacts with other actors. In this film, he makes his character more charismatic and profound - and this can not but rejoice. Natalie Portman, of course, is good. But she practically did not show her character development. Although, of course, it should be praised for her work, because in comparison with the first film, from a purely physical point of view, it was much harder for her. Loki Tom Hiddleston continues to be one of the most disgustingly attractive villains in the fantasy world. And the rest of the actors are an excellent way to distract attention from the main characters and bring to the film a share of humor and diversity.Also worth noting that the film is full of 'little joys', calculated on a fan base. For example, very pleased with a small, but very funny cameo Chris Evans in the role of Captain America. Or already become a classic cameo by Stan Lee. There are also soul-stirring allusions to previous franchise films. And most importantly: do not forget to stay at the screen for a few minutes longer! You are waiting for two additional episodes: the first - after the incredibly colorful final titles, the second - after the usual basic titles. Both episodes are very interesting and directly lay the path to the next film Marvel ... (personally my rating of expectations after these episodes at times increased).
TOTAL. 'Thor 2' is a spectacle that keeps the viewer in suspense from the first to the last seconds. Bright, colorful, saturated, dramatic and even quite unusual, moderately tragic and moderately ridiculous fantastic action, which is absolutely not a pity to spend two hours of free time. This is a solid and high-quality product, which you can safely forgive some plot flaws and inconsistencies. 'Thor 2' - perhaps one of the best fantastic films of the year and one of the most worthy sequels for this genre.Unexpected, very nice gift. A real surprise for fans of fantasy and specifically the magnificent Marvel franchise, which, apparently, only gaining momentum ...Enjoy watching!",8,86,156,13 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A new beginning
","The heroic cosmo-opera 'Star Wars' ended with the third episode 'Revenge of the Sith' in the distant 2005th year, later books and serials opened deeper into the universe, using plots of the expanded canon that shed light on clonic wars and some heroes like Darth Maul, the best villain franchise - Darth Vader. Six episodes of the saga, for all its difference in influence on the viewer and the fans together made up an amazingly solid canvas. The classic adventures of old films and political epic and air battles began the twenty-first century. The new generation requires a new 'Star Wars'. But the merger of Lucas Films and Disney, together with the cancellation of canons, triggered a sharp narrowing of the universe, where the new heroes are creating a new story. The new trilogy wanted to see when it comes out completely, but knowing how they like to squeeze money out of milk cows, then nine episodes may not be limited, so did not begin to delay acquaintance.
The synopsis of the film can be briefly described as follows: Luke Skywalker went into voluntary exile and became a myth. But in a distant galaxy, a conflict is arising between the First Order, inheriting the traditions of the Empire, and the Resistance, led by former Princess Leia. She sends her best pilot to find the map, which will indicate where her brother disappeared. By chance, the card hits the attack aircraft Finn, who does not want to serve the First Order, and the scavenger Ray from the provincial planet Giacca. Find the last Jedi not only they dream, but also the powerful servant of the First Order of Kylo Ren ...
Studio Disney conducted a workshop campaign to promote the seventh episode of the 'Star Wars'. Around the film was created an incredible hype, and at the same time Jay Abrams and his comrades managed almost nothing to talk about the content of the upcoming film. It seems the last time such an atmosphere of mystery surrounding the plot of the fantastic film was before the release of the third 'Matrix'. And the Wachowski brothers were intrigued not for nothing - their picture was generous with surprises (successful or not very much discussed some other time).
Abrams, on the other hand, is inclined to foment intrigue where there is no need. So, he let the fog around the character of Benedict Cumberbatch in the second 'Star Trek', although only the lazy did not know who it was. That's the mystery surrounding the story 'Awakening Force' had no special meaning, because he does not present any special surprises. The director has repeatedly confessed his love for the original Star Wars trilogy and stressed that he was trying to reproduce the stylistics and spirit of the classic episodes of the saga. But in his desire to be equal to them Abrams did not confine himself to the video series - the plot is also built according to the patterns of the early 'Star Wars'. Something similar could be seen in the universe of the Jurassic Period, where the classic 'Park ...' was also resurrected, but in the new high-tech scenery, repeating the classics of the ninety-third year, the film offered nothing fundamentally new. The same can be said about the 'Awakening of Power': it successfully reproduces the atmosphere of old star wars, does not skimp on references and direct quotes, but there is not even a new history here. As it seems to me here the failures of the starting trilogy films, I want to immediately show all the most important, give the right keys, but do not disclose all the cards at once, otherwise the case will prove to be dying before the situation requires it.
Of all the new characters (Finn, Po Dameron, Ray) the latter is better uncovered and even then it is not completely, I think that the episode of the eighth will give a little more information and food for thought about its origin. Finn is also a good character, but could be worked out better, the blessing is kind: a stormtrooper who crossed over to the side of the Resistance, but the motives for desertion are not disclosed, there are no clear leaks to this. According to Dameron, too often loomed on the screen to make any judgments.
Actor's work pleased. The newcomers coped well. Joe Boega in the role of Finn looks good, there is in this stormtrooper a comical element. Daisy Ridley in the role of Ray coped with its task, in her fate I see similarities with Luke and Anakin, in the sense that both grew on desert planets. Giacca is somewhat similar to Tatooine, but the atmosphere there seems gloomier. In the role of Kylo Rena is Adam Driver, the one who I liked as the priest Garuho, whose moral appearance impressed me slightly more than the main character. Kylo Ren is an ambitious character with a great villainous potential, but ultimately it is the synthesis of Anakin Skywalker's rushing, not knowing what he needs. But his ancestor to the dark side was reduced to the Sith, the future Emperor. Somehow his motivation is somehow incomprehensible: he wants to match his ancestor, but in this episode it has not turned out so far.
Verdicting: By and large the film turned out to be quite good. Of the advantages worth noting the style of the original trilogy, spectacular video (in this movie has always succeeded), the acting is not for everyone, but by and large does not cause questions. But the film is worth watching. Wait and see! All good and pleasant viewing!",8,176,281,4 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The beginning of hope
","NEW HOPE - a film that does not require presentation. The phenomenal creation of George Lucas for decades has become the standard of a fantastic adventure in the best possible form.Now it's hard to believe that in the distant seventies the studios did not believe in the success of the Star Wars. In the movie series that broke all box office records and spawned the world's most gigantic army of fans.Of course at that time in America, light cinema was not in high esteem. The Vietnam War, mass rallies, crises ... The situation was just like the then movie. And the young Lucas decided to wake up the society from this gloom and show that there is still a hope for peace and happiness in the world.Having written a somewhat unsightly script called The Adventures of Mace Windu - the Reverend Jedi-Bandu from the planet Ofucci, and afterwards having rewritten it several times, Lucas got the go-ahead from the 20th Century Fox studio. Basically thanks to the same as he is a revolutionary with Fox-Alan Leddu-jr.About those troubles that hit the film crew can be spoken for hours, but it's best to watch the wonderful documentary film The Dream Empire - the story of the original Star Wars trilogy.Looking for the first time Episode 4, I began to look at the movie differently. This is the ideal mixture of various components - from the Star Trek to the Lord of the Rings. Lucas took the best stories from different stories and put them together into one. Probably, Star Wars is the most organic fantasy of all time! And although the story takes place in the Far-away galaxy, it will directly affect each of you.As for the soundtrack, you can say one thing - He's great! Taking composers John Williams (who constantly works with Steven Spielberg), the creators also took a little of their main special effect. Well, who does not agree that the March of the Empire and the Introductory melody are the most memorable melodies of the cinema!Just as true was the decision to take on the main roles unfamiliar to the mass audience of actors, because they will not obscure their starry history itself. And the more it is pleasant to know that New Hope gave the world Harrison Ford.Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, Han Solo and Chewbacca, Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine, Princess Leia and Wedge Antilles - each of us in our dreams associated ourselves with some of those icons. Empire and Alliance, Jedi and Sith - in all of us there is something from them.I watch Star Wars 33 years after their premiere and clearly understand that they give odds to each of today's megadoro blockbusters.In 1977 Lucas released STAR WARS to raise the spirit of people, to make them believe in a dream! It's 2010 now. Turn on your DVD and relax. All will be well, and may the Force be with you!",9,66,129,4 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The first fantasy
","The world of cinema was divided into 2 parts - until the 77th year, and after. Well, just imagine: you were born a year ago in the 1950s, or the 60th. What did you see as a science fiction? Well, 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' as it was dashing and stylish at the time of the release. What else? Ah, the great and terrible Stanley Kubrick showed the overseas viewers the 'Space Odyssey: 2001', in the far-away such a 68th. Such a riot of technology, and now it looks somewhere stylish and, even, fashionably and effectively. Further, our viewers already saw the 'Solaris' of Tarkovsky (another master, only the Soviet one). All these films were essentially revolutionary, but for fans of anti-realism, and masterpiece. But they are unhurried, abstruse, and the people in the cinema though in a certain euphoria, but ... they did not see what could be squeezed out of the fantastic concept.And now, the date has come: May 25, 1977, this is an unforgettable figure for millions of fans, as well as October 5, 1962 for all categories of fans of another, longer franchise. But, 'Star Wars' in the USSR was immediately called 'Star Wars', and its genre was called Soviet movie distributors as 'galactic western'. And if you are interested, then you can look at this stupid poster in all respects, here in KinoBoisk, although ... There are a couple of Soviet posters of this Lucas's film masterpiece, but they are not as stylish as transatlantic, and naughty, lousy.But back to the situation. Before us, the unfortunate rebels desperately trying to shoot back from the clone soldiers (the Imperials who are behind the dark ones), Princess Leia and 2 cheerful robots: C-3PO (faddy anthropoid and golden) and R2-D2 (only to look like a bucket ). Just the same, these two pieces of iron and fall on the sand planet Tatooine, landing from the rescue capsule. They are enslaved by local barygami and bought by a young guy with the super-known (now) Luke. Luke Skywalker. And in the robots contain a lot of information that is able to properly save the galaxy from the yoke of the imperial.Imagine, this is only the first fantasy of Lucas (started with the IVth episode, thinking that he risks and the series can fail), and we are waiting for 2 masterpiece episodes in front and a semi-pop trilogy behind.Many charismatic and memorable characters distinguish Star Wars from other serials. For example, in addition to the above-described robots, the rogue, the pilot and the smuggler Han Solo (young Ford), the terrible dark commander Darth Vader, and countless other attributes of the series: the original design of the Imperial costumes, the death star, the Jedi Knight robes and their main attribute - a light sword, which every spectator certainly would like to receive, despite age, nationality and gender. And so many epic scenes, and copied by John Williams, that sometimes a tear comes to naught (in each of this series), and I still have not seen (nor heard) a single topic that I did not like.I did not find any shortcomings in the film, and I do not seem to find it while George Lucas is alive. Not only that for its time an unreal number of hunches, not to mention the audience likes, so also all this tape is trying to remaster, redraw, re-sound, add special effects, a stylish divide menu, and just box packing. All is alive, juicy and dynamical, and the Russian audience was lucky even more. The quality of the voice recorded in the 77th (eternal cinema, by the way!). 98th (eternal cinema, by the way!). 90's with tapes, 2000's on DVD and now, the lucky ones who bought home theaters and Blu-Ray players.",9,66,129,4 June 2018
Deadpool," In the company of nonsense
","A sharp-tongued mercenary Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) loves the girl of easy virtue Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) and is going to marry her. Idylls come to an end when doctors diagnose Wade's incurable stage of cancer. In the hope of remaining alive, he agrees to participate in an experimental program, whose creators promise not only to cure Wilson, but also to endow him with superpowers. Wade becomes immortal, but his face is disfigured, and in this form he is not going to return to his beloved - wearing a mask and taking the name Deadpool, the new mutant must find the one who turned it into a monster and make it return its former beauty.Even if until recently you have not heard anything about Deadpool, the creators of the project about the talkative 'non-perperable' have done everything to correct this oversight. The promo campaign of the project was unprecedented, then positioning it as a romantic comedy for Valentine's Day, then advertising billboards with emoji. Over the past months, it has been decidedly impossible to get away from Deadpool, and it worked perfectly, given that Wilson is one of the few comic book heroes who constantly interacts with the audience and knows that they are being watched by the parties.This chip is 100% used in the debutant Tim Miller's film, which the Oscar nominee in the category of animated shorts hopes to punch his way to Hollywood. The new Deadpool, unlike the silent assassin who appeared in Wolverine, is exactly what his fans wanted to see. He does not stop, he jokes with a joke and severely annihilates his enemies, while being able to regularly remind him that he is very pleased with the company of spectators.Destruction of the notorious fourth wall is the highlight of 'Deadpool', which seems to make it closer to the public. Like, this guy is talking to you, he's in the board. He listens to the same music as you, watches the same films and jokes the same way. In terms of humor, the film, of course, tries to please everyone and everything: Stebut film adaptation of the X-Men, Hugh Jackman and Liam Neeson, but at the same time, very often Hochma is not of the most intellectual kind, which would have done the honor of writing a sorting comedy. And between the gags of different categories it is not possible to establish even a shaky balance - the scales bow inexorably to the side where they laugh at everything below the belt. Is it less than that? Let's make a discount on the specifics of the main character - after all, he does not have everything in order. And, as practice shows, all the same it is much easier to attract a mass audience with a vulgar joke beyond the foul, rather than trying to humor subtly and intellectually.If you can argue about the comic component - it eventually turns out all the same to an amateur - then visually 'Deadpool' problems do not arise. The introductory action-scene is so ingenious that it raises the bar very high - it's hard to reach it later, but it's rather a script problem that does not offer the protagonist really serious trials. And with ordinary problems in the face of armed scoundrels (and even the main 'boss'), Deadpool copes easily and more than spectacularly - the benefit of the studio has agreed to an adult rating, which allows, without hesitation, to dismember bodies and splash blood in all directions.Do not expect from the 'Deadpool' swirling drama - this story is simple and trivial. And in it there is really little heroic, but a lot of romance, because the main engine of the plot is the desire of a man to look good and like his woman. Primitivism with a touch of nostalgia, which plays great in contrast to the profound modern films about superheroes, where questions of a far more global character are being solved. Deadpool is different, and it can not be bad or good - it's just that way.",9,71,145,4 June 2018
Green Book," It takes a lot of courage to change people's thinking.
","The film, from which at first did not expect delight. The film, behind the ease of irony which hides a deep meaning. A film that you watch without stopping, although this is far from a blockbuster that you have been waiting for for years. It's all about Peter Farinelli's Green Book.The plot tells of a journey through the southern states of a talented black pianist (Mahershala Ali) and his bouncer driver, hired solely for this tour (Viggo Mortenessen). Minor at first sight and a little bydlovaty hero Mortensen during this uncomplicated journey becomes for an esthete pianist a true friend, support and even a treasure of useful knowledge about life and society, and he draws from the boss useful skills in aesthetics, love of art and good parenting.
The plot is very simple, the film looks incredibly easy. Dialogues are written ironically, absolutely not boring, but at the same time they remain filled with meaning for the viewer. The relationship between the characters is the main motive of the film. And how could so different people in all respects be able to become each other friends for life in a few weeks?It should be noted that the leitmotif of 'racism', which at that time was still extremely common in America, especially in the south, was incredibly subtly written. All these hotels are for 'colored', individual cafes, pools and even latrines .. the nuances of that time in the film are shown perfectly, and so that you yourself feel ashamed that this existed. I literally wanted to stand up and give the characters in the face in several scenes.Surprisingly, the director Peter Farinelli had previously shot mostly comedies (and mostly with his brother), and this is his first film in the comedy drama genre. From my point of view, he handled it perfectly and I would love to see what else he would film later, although I can't say before that I set him apart as an interesting director. Perhaps it was the fact that the film was made only by Peter Farenelli very strongly contributed to the 'nobility' of the picture in terms of humor.The funny fact is that one of the screenwriters of the film is Nick Vallelonga, his father was the prototype of the main character Frank (Tony Chatterun) Vallelonga. The script was written on the basis of dictation records made by Nick Vallelonga. Later on these records, Viggo Mortensen learns to speak Italian, because his hero is Italian.The film was shot in the spirit of the 60s, beautiful cars of that time are very well shown, the art of the costume, the receptions in the large houses of the rich public (some 'Gone with the Wind' is immediately remembered)This film is simple, kind, sincere. Without any strain, without life horrors, you know, where someone dies, someone is killed or someone is in prison. The atmosphere of the film is 'soft' and light. You literally find yourself in this time, with terrific cars of all colors of the rainbow, men in flawless day costumes of all colors, gentlemen with whiskey at the bar in hotels listening to the brilliant pianist.The Green Book is not a picture of slavery, racism and humiliation, although it touches on these topics. The Green Book is a film about honesty, human dignity, true friendship and mutual support between people. The film is about the fact that it is very difficult to change the ingrained thinking of society alone, even if you are brilliant and famous.By viewing required.",10,20,34,9 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Yes, power will come with you: part 2
","What can I say about the fifth episode 'The Empire Strikes Back,' I really like the movie, the fifth episode has kept the atmosphere and an easy-naive narrative.Special effects have become larger, the plot has become more interesting and only fuels interest in the next film.In general, this part has everything for the adventure saga count: curious right hero (Luke Skywalker), wise mentor (Obivan), a more wise teacher (Yoda), a humorous steep friend (Captain Solo), which no, but still love Princess Leia and Solo), personal comedians who get in the way (Citripio and R2-T2) and the worst enemy (Darth Vader).The film was successful, yet Lucas would still be interested in the audience, we all were wondering what to wake up with the future Jedi Luke, the smugglers of Solo and Chuya, Princess Leia and with two droids.Back in the movie, a character appeared, the most powerful, wise Jedi Yoda, he is beyond praise. If in the first film the end was happy, then in the second film the end of the open viewer thinks that wakes on. I used to think that George Lucas took all the parts, but in the fifth and sixth films he was a screenwriter.But the film has become more alive, large-scale and interesting, the soundtrack is still magnificent, the actors' play has improved, many say that the fifth film is the best in the saga, I do not argue. The film is a masterpiece.",9,57,120,4 June 2018
Incredibles 2," Pretty good!
","'Incredibles-2' - bright, vigorous, dynamic, full of humor and funny cartoon scenes for family viewing. Everything is fine in it, unless you compare it with the original film and especially with the best films 'Pixar', published in the pre-Disney era. Alas, after the purchase of 'Pixar', in the 'Disney' and failed to create a single sequel that can surpass the original films and 'The Incredibles-2' was no exception on this list.The director and scriptwriter of the first 'The Incredibles' Brad Bird three years ago peremudril with the failed 'Earth of the Future', so this time I decided not to take risks, having made almost a complete remake of my own film. Dramaturgy is again built around playing up family problems and places of people with abilities in society, and the main antagonist still believes that in his troubles, born from a distant childhood, only superheroes are to blame. Of course, watching the same story, retold the second time, even with the addition of a funny Jack Jack, is not as interesting as the first, especially given the number of films about superheroes that have appeared over the last decade.The expected change in the plot was only the distribution of roles in the superfamily Parrov. Now Elastiko earns money in the corporation 'Devor', at the same time saving the world and the reputation of superheroes, and Mister Exclusiveness awaits a full family break-out in one of the mansions of the Devors, a midlife crisis, chronic insomnia, depression and the problem of finding a new identity. Detective intrigue, which was the hallmark of the first 'The Incredibles', this time became more predictable. In both films, the main villain reveals long before the final, but if in the original film the appearance of Toddler's kid became a real surprise for the audience, then in the sequel the main villain is easily guessed already in the tenth minute of the film. In order to somehow diversify the plot, Bird tried to go many times to the tried and tested way - to increase the team of superheroes. In theory, this could give the sequel a new breath, but in reality it looks artificially and somewhat strange, especially considering that in the first film Buddy made a total purge of the superhero world.
If the original cartoon was equally interesting to children and adults, the new 'The Incredibles' turned out to be more straightforward, simplistic and childish. Adult viewers can be more pleased with the guessing of references to various films that permeate all the plot lines of the sequel. Already at the very beginning, Byrd plays with amusement the famous scene of erasing memory from the 'Men in Black', then the plot moves along the rolled track of 'Hancock', telling about the need for good PR for superheroes, in the middle it smoothly passes to 'Bondiana' with the appropriate style and music , and ends with a retelling of a couple episodes of 'People X'.Children such complex allusions will be incomprehensible, but they will like the dynamics and humor of the new film, which are significantly added, in comparison with the original. Cartoon cheerfully begins immediately after the battle with Buddy Payne, which ended the first 'The Incredibles' and after that famously rushes through a lot of adventures, pursuit and fights, right up to the finale. The fun this time is built, mainly around the polymorphic Jack Jack, who adores not only cookies, but also a zombie, who can not understand anything good a child can. All this, together with the immediacy and uncontrollability of the manifestation of emotions and various superpowers, delivers to the father a lot of hard minutes. However, he gets not only him, but also a thieving raccoon. His fight with Jack Jack, made in the style of Walt Disney's classic films, has tangible moral defects, but it also causes the most laughter in the hall.Of course, through the abundance of fun and action scenes from all sides, the ideological aspects of the 'children's' cartoon also slip. As a positive US Secretary of State, the image of Hollywood's favorite Hollywood Clinton is easily discernible, and feminist ideas permeate all the plot lines of the film from the first to the last frame. Starting with the 'Mulan', released in 1998, militant feminism has become the main semantic concept of Disney products, adding with each new cartoon. 'The Incredibles-2' raises its banner to such a height that it will be difficult to surpass in the future, because absolutely all the female characters in it from Violet to Evelyn DeVore not only completely surpass their narrow-minded, listless and incapable partners, but also conduct among themselves amusing discussions about the role of women in society. On the one hand, this really reflects certain trends in public life, but on the other hand it directly programs them. It's funny that the villain Ekranotiran is just talking through television to zombie Americans that in the modern world people are completely lazy, they stopped critically assessing information and simply mindlessly absorb the dregs that are pouring on them from every screen every day.
Somewhat strange in the cartoon about the family is built and the supply of family values. The Parrov family is in fact completely connected only at the very end, under the threat of survival, and before that, the male and female parts of the family practically do not interact. Elastiko, completely forgetting about the family and the baby Jack Jack, after work prefers to rest in an expensive hotel, and Violet is absorbed in the first teenage love, not noticing anyone around her. In the end, it turns out that Edna Modd, voiced in the original by Brad Bird himself, puts much more effort into the education of the younger son Parov than his own mother.Well, unlike the dubious value assumptions, the technical side of the cartoon is flawless. A huge time difference between the first and second cartoons allows you to clearly see what a huge path made computer animation in the last decade. Thanks to the improvement of the technologies for the transmission of facial expressions and emotions, from time to time it really seems that on the screen there are actors that are not drawn, but live.In general, if you do not pay attention to the secondary, banal and straightforward plot and crumpled finale, the cartoon fully fulfills its functions of easy summer entertainment for the whole family. But for many years Piksar has raised the bar not only technical, but also the semantic content of its best cartoons, that against their background, 'The Incredibles-2' looks just like a tuned eight next to the newest Mercedes.",8,216,475,14 June 2018
The Godfather," A movie that can not be abandoned
","An important place in American history is the period when several thousand Sicilian emigrants went to the United States in search of a new, better life, in which there would be no tyranny of the Palermo and Messinxich dons. Who knew at that time that this 'bunch of Sicilian emigrants' would occupy a high place in the United States and in the history of this country.Sicily is one of the most beautiful places in Italy. Unfortunately Sicilians, quite friendly inhabitants of this island, the words-synonyms of Sicily are not only olives, butter and wine, but also words like omerta, vendetta and mafia. Yes, the mafia. A small bunch of bandit mackerel in Sicily, run by the Don. In the US, this word took a slightly different meaning. A huge number of gangsters who seek to conquer and rule all the States. A family is a mafia, a mafia is a family headed by a cruel and wise person who manages everything and who owns everything. Proudly and shortly - don.Mario Puzo is a brilliant writer, rightly considered to be a recognized classic of the twentieth-century literature, having written several excellent and worthy works, the best of which is undoubtedly the novel 'The Godfather'. A book about the life of gangsters and revealing all the doors to the world of the mafia. Mario Puzo was a great connoisseur of human psychology, but the psychology of people who transgressed the law especially. That is why in his novel he explores each character to the depths of his soul and climbs into the most intimate corners of their thoughts.The novel, and indeed, the film - is not a direct and reliable historical source, but, nevertheless, it contains the quintessence of the criminal world. Five families of New York Piuso wrote from the real five families of New York, Johnny Fontaine Puzo wrote from Frank Sinatra. The literature was tired of books about Al Capone and Frank Costello, and Puzo made a move to a horse-invented a criminal family that was not really there, but which subsequently won, without exaggeration, the whole world.It often happens that the director, when stating a picture, leaves the original and is engaged in arbitrariness. Francis Ford Coppola director is no less brilliant than the rest of the directors. He squeezed everything that can be learned from the novel Puzo and put it into the film. Doing nothing without adding something new or removing something from the book, Coppola and Puzo created a masterpiece. A masterpiece in everything. Mario Puzo's book became a masterpiece of literature, and Francis Ford Coppola created the film - a masterpiece, a film - a classic that just can not help but like it. Coppola not only superbly put the film, but simply brilliantly picked up the actors. Who knows what was the fate of the film without Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Coppola skillfully created the atmosphere of New York at the end of the forties, but also the atmosphere of family life, the life of people from Sicily.Vito Carleone is a wise and cruel man with clear principles, a loving but stern father. Marlon Brando was just awesome dona
Carleone. His character is a serious strategist who has achieved power and respect himself. Don Carleone's sad gaze, his smooth gestures, his unique voice and his unforgettable 'bulldog jaw' forever blended into the image of the viewer.Don Carleone - this is Marlon Brando - sloven and lover in life, but on the screen - a genius who embodied the image of Don Carleone - a strong spirit of a man and a cruel gangster, who has enormous authority. Vito Carleone is a very impressive person who knew how to get others to do things their own way. Marlon Brando with his game was able to make the viewer believe that before him is not just an actor playing a role, but a real person is that same severe don. Brando is a great improvisator.Michael Carleone character is no less interesting than his father. Michael is kind-hearted and truthful, knowing what his father does, he never wanted to deal with his family and participate in criminal quarrels. Al Pacino played his character no less brilliant than Marlon Brando. Pacino showed all the destruction of the human psyche and the transformation of his hero: from the uninitiated in the affairs of the family of the young war hero, to the new Don Carleone, possessing an iron will, foresight, wisdom and dignity.
Sonny Carleone is not at all like Michael and Vito. He is an impulsive warrior, but a bad strategist who prefers to go ahead, not act cunning. Coppola did not lose on the fact that he called for the role of an American from Sicily. James Caan brilliantly played the role of Sonny - a man with an explosive Italian temperament, ready to always stand up for the family.In addition to the brilliant acting and excellent production in the film, there is the wonderful music of the composer Nina Rota. An excellent melody, fallen in love with everyone and has long become a classic.'Godfather' is a masterpiece, an ideal gangster movie. The film without minuses, blunders and cliches, which pulls to review, even if you know it by heart. This is a classic, a gangster epic, a bible for cinephiles, giving answers to all the questions. A movie that teems with crown phrases that have long since become part of everyday life. A worthy picture, without exaggeration, is the best in its kind.'Behind every wealth lies a crime' (c) - it is this phrase Honore De Balzac stands at the beginning of the work of Puzo. The film, if briefly, actually about it. And about the proposal, 'from which you can not refuse' (c).",9,100,171,2 June 2018
