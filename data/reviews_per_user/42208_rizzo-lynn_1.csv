Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," It's So Overt it's Covert
","First, let me start by saying that I am a huge Sherlock Holmes fan. I have read all of the stories and novels, and seen many different TV shows and movies about the infamous character. I am here to tell you that even though this movie (along with the first movie) does not follow the traditional idea of Sherlock Holmes, you can be a Holmes fan and still love this movie! With Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, you will surely be entertained. Honestly, there was not a dull moment throughout the film, and though some may complain that the movie was too silly, I would care to disagree. It was a very well executed movie, and I think the constant jokes and humorous action between the individuals, gives us more insight and helps to make us feel more connected to the movie and the characters in general. In my opinion, it was better than the first.People are expecting the exact plot from what Sir Arthur Conan Doyle first wrote. Please let me tell you: those movies and TV shows have already been created. I applaud Guy Ritchie for giving us a twist on the stories. Yes, Holmes and Watson are definitely a bit crazier than the what we read, but that is what makes the movie exciting and different from the many other Sherlock Holmes movies. The point is, that Guy Ritchie's movies were not meant to be the exact same plots as what we have seen before. If he didn't put his own twists into the stories, we would be watching the same movies over and over again. He has given us a fresh look into Sherlock Holmes that we have read about, which I think keeps the stories and ideas of Holmes alive.Along with his excellent fresh ideas and overall movie making, Robert Downey Jr., and Jude Law give great performances once again. They have the BEST chemistry I have seen between a Holmes and Watson character, which is one reason why this movie is so great.Also, I think that the villain, Prof. Moriarty, provides for a fantastic extra thrill. Holmes finally comes up against someone who is the perfect match for his intellect. The movie is 2 hours and 9 minutes, but honestly it does not seem that long because it is so fast movie and thrilling! I highly recommend going to see the film, it is worth your time.",10,7,18,17 December 2011
