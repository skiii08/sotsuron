The Rock," Get Ready To Rock....
","An amazing piece of cinema.In Micheal Bay we have an action director capable of greatness itself after only 3 feature films Bad Boys, The Rock and Armageddon.The Rock is a stylish, flamboyant, extraordinary action film that is definitely amongst the best there is.Hans Zimmer is a geniusA truly great film..",9,1,1,4 December 1998
LÃ©on: The Professional," EMOTIONAL CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE
","IF IN YOUR LIFE YOU FEEL SOMETHING IS MISSING FROM MAKING IT COMPLETE THEN YOU WILL KNOW WHAT LEON IS ABOUT.LEON IS EASILY THE BEST FILM FROM LUC BESSON AND JEAN RENO GIVES A PERFORMANCE OF SUCH DEPTH YOU FEEL SADNESS AND HAPPINESS.IN NATALIE PORTMAN WE HAVE AN ACTRESS, WHO AT THE AGE OF 12, WHEN SHE DID LEON, GAVE ONE, IF NOT THE GREATEST PERFORMANCE I'VE EVER SEEN, TRULY BEAUTIFUL.WITH STING'S SHAPE OF MY HEART AT THE END CREDITS THIS FILM IS REMARKABLE AND NOT FULLY APPRECIATED.",9,0,1,20 November 1998
Face_Off," In Order To Trap Him He Must Become Him. I Wouldn't Do It. Not In The Same Class Of Hard Boiled And Don't Mention This Film In The Same Breath As The Killer
","Face Off is alright but far too overrated. Both Travoltra and Cage are good with a tricky story.Basically if you have not seen John Woo's Hong Kong films you will think that this film is the dogs' bullo##s.Hard Target is much better and even Broken Arrow comes close.Even though I must admit the last ten mintues along with the opening and opening credits was worth the admission fee alone.No way as good as Hard Boiled (An amazing film and what a last hour) and The Killer is a master, so not in that league.Johnny Woo is still the greatest film director ever no doubt for The Killer alone but this was a little disappointing. Definitely seen better and The Rock and Con Air are better.O.K Film with a great last ten minutes.",7,0,0,9 December 1998
The Usual Suspects," SIMPLY GREATNESS PERSONIFIED
","IN A WORLD WHERE NOTHING IS WHAT IT SEEMS, YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK BEYOND..THE USUAL SUSPECTS SIMPLY FROM THE FIRST TO LAST SHOT ASKS YOU TO THINK WHAT IS REALITY AND WHAT IS NOT. I DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL THE VERY LAST SHOT WHAT WAS GOING ON AND I'M STILL NOT CERTAIN IF I KNOW NOW..MUST BE SEEN..",10,0,1,20 November 1998
The Game," Are You Ready To Play?
",What a top film. With Seven I thought that films cannot get better this but with The Game director David Fincher proved me wrong.This film is talking about how you live your life and taking living for granted and then says What will you do to live again?What would you do?Top film with a top directorWatch it at all costs.,8,0,1,10 December 1998
From Dusk Till Dawn," The Goriest Movie Bar None
",Think of the goriest film ever and times it by ten and you have From Dusk Till Dawn.O.K this film will not tell you about life or anything like that but enterainment does not get better than this.For me personally I think Robert Rodiguez is a better writer and director than Quentin Tarantino and I could not have seen him make his superb script full justiceI do not know what else to say apart from WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW AND FINALLY WOW.WHAT A GREAT FILM. AMAZING.,10,0,0,9 December 1998
Jerry Maguire," A Moving Cinematic Experience
","When I first watched Jerry Maguire I expected to destroy it. Even though it has various parts I did not like, this was not enough for me not to think this is a top movie.Tom Cruise has never been better and the acting is amazing.The script hits the button.What I liked most was the director Cameron Crowe this was the first film I had seen from him and he impressed me so much it is hard to express it in words.Bruce Springsteen's Secret Garden is a brilliant song and over an emotional, intelligent, absorbing cinematic experience.A MUST SEE",8,2,4,9 December 1998
Die Hard," ACTION SUPREME
",THERE IS NOTHING I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS FILM EXCEPT :THE GREATEST ACTION FILM EVER MADE.,10,1,2,20 November 1998
Con Air," Air-tanstic
","What can I say about this excellent film.Simon West as his first feature film has outdone himself and the only negative thing is maybe his first film will be his best film but what a film nevertheless.Nicolas Cage is suddendly a remarkable action star and all the supporting cast are great.Lean Rimes' How can I live? is great.Jerry Bruckhiemer even without the late great Don Simpson continues to do himself pround, keep it up.",8,0,0,4 December 1998
Braveheart," THE SECOND GREATEST FILM EVER MADE..
",AN AMAZING FILM AND EXPERIENCE FROM AN AMAZING MAN.WHEN I FIRST SAW BRAVEHEART IN 96 IT LEFT ME BREATHLESS.A MAN WHO BELIEVED IN A CAUSE AND WITH IT PAID THE ULTIMATE PRICE.EVERYMAN DIES NOT EVERYMAN TRULY LIVES.NEVER A TRUER WORD..,10,2,3,20 November 1998
