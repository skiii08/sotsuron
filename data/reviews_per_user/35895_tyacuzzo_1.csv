Iron Man 3," Should of been called Tony Stark I
","The movie should of been called Tony Stark I, for it has nothing to do with the two previous Iron Man movies. As others have said, they wasted the Mandarin character, turning him into a joke. Most of the story is about Tony's inner demons, boring!! Then they try to make the movie kid friendly by introducing a child's part to help Tony as he once again is lost in the rubble which is his life. Really, thought that is why he made Pepper his girlfriend. Was utterly disappointment with this release, seems like it was rushed and thrown together, because the story line is barely coherent. Don't waste you time on this, wait till one of your friends buys the DVD/Blu Ray, borrow it from them and then help them by trashing it.",1,12,24,17 July 2013
