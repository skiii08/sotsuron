Mission: Impossible III," The WORST mission
","This was by far the weakest of the three MI movies. Their is absolutely no style whatsoever in the direction. Woo's MI2 was done beautifully compared to Abram's dull version. MI3 seems nothing more than an extended episode of Alias. I have heard people love the action sequences, yes they are great but they can be found in any action movie these days. Yes we know directors can do anything with CGI, so whats new? That is why MI2 worked so well, the CGI was great but their was style, and flair. This movie seemed nothing more than a chance to show off new editing techniques. The plot was extremely clich√©. Who did not know about an hour into the movie about the so called 'twist'. And the villain? PSH is a great actor, but here he brings nothing to the performance his speech is monotone throughout the entire performance. BORING, again no flair whatsoever. This movie is not performing well at the box office because it is not that good of a movie, not because Tom C. is jumping up and down on Oprah.",Null,0,1,13 May 2006
