Ghost," Touching
","So many things about this movie are- objectively speaking-preposterous, unsubtle, cringey, laughable or simply bad.That said, none of this at the end of the day matters much: Ghost is a classic romance, with good leads, a highly watchable storyline, plenty of charm and wit and a climax that it seems literally to be physiologically impossible not to cry buckets over. The reason for this last attribute is that Ghost of course taps into many very fragile parts of the emotions that reside in nearly all of us- it is hard to sneer at a film that so earnestly carries on its' sleeve such motifs as the joy and depth of love, the inevitable fear and mystery of mortality, and the fathomless pain of loss. Such themes have seldom been dealt with in Hollywood movies in quite so brazen and nothing-if-not-sincere a manner. This is perhaps a part of Ghost's magic and endurance.There are not many movies that tackle the 'otherside' of death as Ghost does; and of course the reason is that nothing could be harder to do satisfyingly, convincingly. Ghost on many levels does indeed fail to do so itself; the script is duff, many of the concepts it suggests are crude and ridiculous; and yet such objection seems somehow churlish given the undeniable ballsiness-if nothing else- of the movie's subject matter. Few movies- hokey or perfect- can lay claim to offering such emotional solace to people's real life experiences of bereavement than Ghost, no matter how much the lines and the plot developments might grate upon your nerves. In one of the movie's most moving scenes, the viewer is able to vicariously experience that tantalising, painful wish-fulfilment that is longed for by any one who has ever suffered the death of a loved one; that final embrace that so many are denied.It is ultimately this sincerity and universality that- just about- carries the film along from start to finish; helped of course by Whoopi Goldberg's turn as an apparently fraudulent psychic- Sam's blustering, clucking, reluctant key to communicating with Molly. The role famously earned Goldberg an Academy Award and remains a sparkling gem of a performance. Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze never betray the film or highlight its' weaker points in their respective performances, and the two share a good level of chemistry together, more particularly impressive given the amount of scenes they spend unable to interact.Good movie. Don't forget your Kleenex.",Null,1,2,4 December 2007
Spider-Man 2," Let's not mince words- This film kicked proverbial ass
","This is the perfect summer blockbuster.Generally I tend not to be a fan of these dubious blockbuster movies that've been in vogue in Hollywood summers for a few years now. They're all well and good to go see with a gang of friends after the BBQ or before the beach party- but as a rule, and though it's a clich√©d sentiment, they just lack heart.This, though, is something different. Spider-man, the original movie, was something that I wasn't awaiting with my tongue hanging out in hungry anticipation. I ambled along to the cinema a week or so after opening night, practically by accident, expecting an entertaining romp on a summer evening with my BF- but expecting nothing more. What can i say- I came out in love with the movie. Although i'll be the first to admit that in the past I've ranted in unison with the most stuck-up of critics on the damage and evils of CGI and the blockbuster breed of movies in general, I simply turned around when i saw this movie- luscious effects, excellent cinematography, downright nasty villain, great direction and scripting. Add in the ever so slightly angsty performances of the ever wonderful Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst plus ace cast set against an achingly beautiful NY backdrop, and this was just one of the best films of the year.And now, the sequel. Wow. This movie is really really better. where the first stood alone as a melancholic tale of the loneliness that must be endured by a good man, the second film deepens and expands upon the real themes that were found in the first. 'Sequel' is a word with bad connotations- and one almost feels the term is unjust for such a wonderful movie. This is a movie which is rich, romantic, funny, poignant, and just exciting as hell.Whether you're marvelling at the swooping, poetic magnificence of Spiderman's sky- scraper acrobatics, becoming emotionally entangled in Peter's raw deal in life, biting nails in the jaw-dropper actions scenes or shedding a surreptitious tear for the lovers of this entrancing tragi-comedy, i just advise you to watch out. You might end up loving this movie a little more than is socially advisable.",9,1,2,23 June 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," In a word, Awesome
","An achingly beautiful, black and wondrous story that swoops effortlessly from the epic to the personal and back again-can a random kiwi better known for zombie slasher movies really be entrusted with sometihng like that?the answer is yes. Peter Jackson's The Lord Of the Rings Trilogy is one of the great works of the new millennium, and no amount of nay-sayers can change that. In all aspects, including cinematography, direction, acting and effects, the Lord of the Rings excels and becomes an awesome piece of fantasy storytelling, becoming not only a wondrous technical achievement but also one filled with pathos, emotion and darkness.oh yes, and it's way better than star wars. :-P",10,1,2,29 December 2004
Edward Scissorhands," Words can't describe the magic of this movie (small spoiler)
","Edward scissorhands is one of the most beautiful films of all time. Although I have not seen all of Tim Burtons' films, I feel certain that it is humanly impossible for him to create a greater film than this. It is a magical, fantastical, tragic fairy tale for all ages (i know that that phrase is attached to hundreds of undeserving movies, but trust me: this film is incredible.) Johny Depp, in one of his greatest ever performances, is moving, childlike, and funny in this off-beat role, playing Edward, a misfit and outsider (with shards of metal for hands), who enters a small village community and is taken in by a kindly family. This film speaks to anyone who has ever felt isolated, different, or lonely. It's a beautiful, beautiful movie. You will never see another movie at all like this masterpiece. watch it. you will laugh, you will cry, you will fall under its' spell.",Null,0,0,5 March 2004
The Little Mermaid," Perfect Kids film
","This movie is a stirling piece of work. It stands watcihng and re-watching, both by adults and kids, for its' glorious mixture of fairy tale, gentle but laugh out loud humour, amazing songwriting and downright energy.The Little Mermaid stands as an everlasting monument to the greatness that was oh, such a short time ago, Disney Studios. The films of Disney may continue their descent into mediocrity and perhaps in time cease all together, but what they will be remembered for is their glory days that this wonderful, wonderful movie is a part of, and not a sad downfall.One criticism- fire whoever named the Prince.",10,1,1,19 January 2005
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," truly breath-taking
","In Ang Lee's martial arts master work, even those who don't enjoy kung fu movies will find alot to marvel at.Having never been a great fan of action movies in general (particularly ones in foreign language) I was skeptical at first as to how good this movie could be. However, being directed by the same guy who shot one of my ALL TIME favourite movies (sense and sensibility) I ended up watching it.I still don't think he matched is masterpiece Sense and sensibility, but in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Ang Lee created a beautiful cinematic work.the other worldish feel that this film held for me was spell binding enough. The landscape and laws of ancient, mythological china were brought to lifewith mystical magic and so much elegiac beauty.the fight scenes wonderful too. instead of dull, seen-it-before fight choreography, Lee introduces the ability of flight to his characters, making for surreal, but wonderfully captivating and exhilerating viewing.Chow Yun Fat shines as ever in the role of a wise chinese warrior, prevented from confessing his love for the woman he has been passionately in love with for years by strict codes of conduct.",Null,1,2,9 April 2004
Moulin Rouge!," Inspired, inspirational, cinematic Joy
","this is probably one of my favourite movies of all time. that isn't to say that everyone will love it as I do, of course... It is definately the type of movie that divides people into two classes: those who absolutely love, cherish, and adore it, and those who absolutely loathe, hate and despise it. count me into the former.To me, Baz luhrmann (the visionary, slightly mad director behind Romeo + Juliet) has created one of the rarest, most precious and beautiful gems of cinema, ever. The performances (a fizzling, sparkling cinematic pairing of the ever wonderful Ewan Mcgregor, and the heartbreaking, beautiful Nicole Kidman being the central ones), the sets, the costumes, the story, the themes, the music, and everything else that makes up this movie is sumptuous to the senses, overflowing with colour, emotion, energy, beauty and power. Luhrmann, who wrote the screenplay himself, along with Craig Pierce, (with whom he had already collaborated with on both his previous movies, Romeo + Juliet, and Strictly Ballroom) has admitted himself, that the movie is not aiming to be 'psychologically thick'. rather, it is a surreal, emotional journey, beautifully scripted, that aims not for realism, but 'truth' of feeling. full of little gems (The scene inwhich Christian comes up with the refrain 'the hills are alive with the sound of music' is a lovely example)  and hundreds of truly show-stopping sequences, such as the incredibly intense 'El tango de roxanne' scene, inwhich Christian's jealousy and anger towards his lover satine are brought to incredibly to the fore, through vigourous, erotic dancing, and swelling climax. Though this movie is notorious for it's MTV style quick cutting and fast paced, wild visuals and cinematography, I think it is infact not appreciated enough for what lends the film its heart and soul: the love story.The sequences set in the infamouse Moulin Rouge itself are, indeed, faced paced and exhilerating (perhaps to some, nauseating). however, Luhrmann steps up and down the pace of the camera. Even if at times it distracts some viewers with its restless, snappy cutting, it also becomes poetic and tender, if never quite stopping its' beautiously surreal movement and viewpoints. I've never been lifted higher out of my cinema seat than the joyeous scenes of the lovers duets 'The elephant love medley' or 'come what may'. At points, the swelling emotion and magic is truly incredible, the emotional highs and lows the movie takes you on are truly amazing.This movie is a pulsating, touching, moving, funny, musical, tragic and wondrous work, that revolves around an age old theme: love, celebrating it and exciting all those whom it speaks, or perhaps sings to.",10,1,2,24 February 2004
Titanic," a weak, but at times truly incredible movie (a slight spoiler)
","Titanic is the sort of movie that you cannot critisize without mentioning its good parts, and cannot praise without recalling its dire ones. in many ways, it is very reminiscent of the old-style Hollywood romances- epic in length, enourmous in budget and popularity, weak in the eyes of some of its more critical viewers, and, fast destined for a high place in the most famous films of all time.Rose (Kate Winslet), a young, beautiful, upperclass and miserable passenger on the famously 'Unsinkable ship' (perhaps at this moment it would be good to point out that infact, contrary to popular belief, titanic was never in reality marketted as 'the unsinkable ship'... ahem, however) is disullsioned with life. Bearing this in mind, she makes a trip one evening to the stern (i think?) of the Titanic, climbs the railings, and prepares to jump into the freezing cold waters of the ocean below. As she prepares herself to jump, she is spotted by the equally young and beautiful, yet poor and freespirited artist Jack (leonardo Dicaprio), who manages to persuade her not to jump. And thus begins a beautiful friendship between the two- much to the distress and dissaproval of Rose's friends and family. Suprise, suprise, the relationship soon develops into sometihng more, and they become lovers. Just as their passionate love affair reaches steamy heights, the two become caught up, inevitably in the ship's sinking, and one of the greatest distaster sequences ever, ever filmed commences in the film's last hour: full of horror, tragedy, and terrible reality. The first two hours, driven by, concentrated on, and revolving around the romantic love affair between Rose and Jack, are clunking and thin. The script, while perhaps not dire, is certainly no masterpiece (written by the director, James Cameron) rather too full of cliche and annoyingly unsubtle messages designed perhaps to appeal to Cameron's conception of a modern audience's tastes (Rose, somewhat unconvincingly for the daughter of a conservative, upperclass, english society family, is an avid reader of Freud and waxes lyrical about Piccasso: 'It's like looking into a dream or something. there's truth but no logic.')this is perhaps too hard. some moments in these first two hours are lovely. I know that I might sound like a jackass for saying so, but in one of the truly iconic moments of romantic beauty that this movie, or indeed, any movie has to offer, what young girl was not lifted out of her cinema seat by that soaring, beautiful shot of the lovers at the ship's helm (i think? lol) at sunset? Dicaprio, a vastly underrated actor (and this movie might have something to do with that) as the inspired and inspirational young free spirit is at his most beautiful, boyish best, and manages to inject energy and charisma into a character who is sadly lacking in depth. (don't get me wrong, i loved him in this movie- being the hopeless romantic/ teenage girl i am....!) Winslet, another wonderful actress, is doing her best in her own role, but this is a more tricky one to make work: Rose is a character that makes a transition- from buttoned up, serious, posh 'spoilt brat', as Jack names her, to impulsive, adventurous and sexually liberated young rebel chick. there is nothing wrong with this, of course, but the fact that even if we want to applaud her, we find her character extremely difficult to warm to, let alone grow to like or love. this has, however, probably never been a hinderance to what turned out to be definately a teen girl's movie- who was concentrating on Kate when we have Leo to look at? Other major characters include Rose's angry, idiotic, and completely villainous fiancee, Cal, who is determined to control Rose, in a way written to make any self respecting feminist's sight turn red with rage. Billy Zane plays the role in what i think is irony and humour, but the character is so poorly constructed, that even if this is so, his turn is far too broad and characturish, rather than a real performance of any kind. Also, there is Rose's mother (i'm not sure of the actress's name) another shameful steriotype (after watching this, i soon seriously started doubting if james Cameron's writing skills could ever possibly extend beyond borrowing a tragic historic event and placing a collection of cliches to bounce and react off one another in a ridiculous way) this time, of the cold, distant, and selfish mother, with little thought or feeling for others, and who is mainly motivated by money and rich husbands.(it's no wonder Rose was about to commit suicide, when placed in such company)However, this movie truly comes into it's own in when, as I mentioned, events reach their penultimate, inevitable conclusion, and that fateful night that the titanic collided with the Iceberg. In a gripping, heart wrenching hour long sequence, the love story finally takes back seat, and Cameron paints a portrait of the Titanic's last few hours above water. Indeed, this movie is well, well, WELL worth watching if only for this ending. I have never met someone who wasn't movied to tears by this film... however, i don't think i've ever met someone who was moved to tears by the love story's tragic conclusion. The fact that the enormity, horror and tragedy of the Titanic's sinking actually took place capsizes (forgive the allusion) the love story, which now more than ever feels synthetic, fake and trivial.No, the tears I shed for this film were for the musicians who played 'Nearer my God to Thee' as the ship sank. My tears were for the Irish thirdclass woman and her two children, as she tucks them into bed for the last time, becuase she knows there are no life boats for them. my tears were for the old couple who lie in bed, together, peaceful, and ready for death. it is in these scenes that the film displays incredible, beautiful and tragic humanity and greatness.",Null,2,3,15 March 2004
