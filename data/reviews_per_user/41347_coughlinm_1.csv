The Blair Witch Project," slackers lost in the woods.
","I saw this film when it was first released back in 1999. I will also admit that I was taken in by the enormous hype surrounding the film. In fact that was the main reason I went to see it, I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. So, as I left the Theadora 90 minutes later, I could not help to feel conflicted. Its not that I thought that The Blair Witch Project was a bad movie, Not at all. In fact there is some truly spooky things going on in this movie. The creepiness of the woods with all the wig snapping and such. The 'witch' ramping up the psychological warfare on our three 'comrads'; this was quite effective movie making. I guess my problem with the movie was that I felt I wasted seven bucks on a fake documentary that pretends to be real that I already know is fake. Even If I didn't know this was a fake before hand, some of the acting is so over the top I could have figured it out easily. Is it just me or did Heather, Josh and Mike come off as thorougher unlikable? So much so that when they finally met they'r demise, my gut reaction was-'OH WELL.' I pariticulary found Heather a foul mouthed little snot. One more F bomb and I was going to reach into the screen and slap her face. All that said, this is still a not too bad movie. If you can get past the endlessly irritating ideologue, this film does have it moments.",5,1,2,22 August 2005
