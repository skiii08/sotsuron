Skyfall," Could have been better
","I was really enjoying the film until they went to the cabin, where the rest of the movie took place. It got boring and uninteresting. Staying at one location in a bond movie does not work. Bond always goes places, like Russia, India, China... everywhere. He went to a cabin and stayed there, used old weaponry and talked to old people for the rest of the movie and made booby traps like Kevin McCallister.Bond does not work defensively, it's too boring for him.I started too wonder for about three days why I did not like the movie. Then it finally came to me. 'M' should have died in the court room, then bond would be upset and be on revenge and it would also be a shock to the viewers of the movie.Bond would have then been on the attack, went to Q to get more awesome gadgets, find him, and defuse the villain's master plan. I would feel satisfied at the end of the movie because M's death was avenged and the movie would end with more of a bang.Overall, I liked the movie until the cabin, it got dull and stayed dull until the end, and most people I know feel the same way.By the way, what happened to the actual bond music when action starts, it's non-existent in these Daniel Craig movie's. That music was made to make you feel like it's Bond time, this is a bond movie. I don't feel like I am watching a bond movie anymore. They play it in the trailer... that's cool I guess.Compare the over the top action and Crazy nonsense in Die Another Day, where he traveled all over, had a cloaking car that had gadgets like a car from twisted metal, fought a British guy that was actually Korean because he changed his face, a guy that had diamonds shattered into his face, and went to a party in a mansion made of pure ice. Oh and compare the Song from that movie to this one.Now think, is this new movie a Bond film?",5,4,9,11 April 2013
Event Horizon," Ginormously Underrrated!!!
","I only write reviews for movies that are uderrated and should be watched.In Short, this movie scare's you mentally, not by gory scenes and horrific scenes, but by the thought of what is possible and a story that shows you mathematically and intelligently that hell, or something like it does exist in the solar system and that, you should fear it because hell is not pleasant, especially not in this movie. The characters are well developed and the story creates a fear of something very unlike freddy or jason, but something more real and possible as described in the movie.If you do not pay attention to this movie, you will not get it. It scares you in a different way, and leaves you thinking if it is possible...",Null,0,0,24 February 2010
The Island," Ridiculously Underrated,One of the Best, DO NOT MISS THIS MOVIE!!!
","I wish I could write reviews like some of the people on here just to be able to express how great I thought this movie was in the most intellectual way, so bare with me. By far one of the best Sci Fi action thriller suspense drama movies ever.This movie is 2005 and I watched it on blu-ray on a 40inch 1080ptv with a Yamaha 5.1 system. It was my first time seeing this movie and I'm glad I saw it this way instead of on a SDTV with television 4watt sound and 10 minute long commercials. The experience was awesome, and I'm only seeing it now in 2010.Every actor in this movie was excellent especially 'McGregor'. You really feel involved with the characters as the first part really focuses on the main characters, character development. I do not want to say too much because I could ruin it for people. Watch it, not knowing what kind of movie it is, because it's got everything.The action scenes are mind blowing, just as good as Transformers movies, I guess I should expect that from Micheal Bay. The cinematography is beautiful, picture perfect panoramic scenes. Some of the scenes I would just want to pause capture and put it as a wallpaper on my computer have it made into a poster, you just know that some of the shots are done purposely a certain way to make you say wow! If you are going to watch this movie please watch it in high definition to fully appreciate it. I don't know if I would like this movie as much if I didn't see it this way. Oh, the only reason I gave it a 9 is because I thought a part of an action scene was ridiculously unbelievable for them to survive, but after all it's a movie right!? By the way, the only reason I am talking more about the action and cinematography is because I don't want to give away any pieces of the story because it is that good. Thanks for listening...",9,1,1,23 February 2010
