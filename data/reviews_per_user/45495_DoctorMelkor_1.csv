The Devil's Advocate," not since Milton
","Possible spoilersI just want to agree wholeheartedly with the primary viewer assessment of this movie.  It is wonderful, and I am glad not to be the only one to recognize that Pacino's character's name is a joke by the Devil.On that point, I just want to say that I think this movie provides one of the most convincing portrayal's of the Devil's character I've seen or read since the wonderful one crafted by Milton himself (Paradise Lost, the greatest single piece of English-language literature of all time).  As in Paradise Lost, the Devil's Advocate gives the Devil a 'realistic personality', something almost never done in any venue.  Yes, the character is so passionately acted that some have accused Pacino of overacting, but a spirit so passionate as to actually vow eternal war against God, whom he knows from personal experience to be Omnipotent, has got to be pretty fiery (if you'll pardon the term).  In Devil's Advocate, like in Milton, the Devil's statements and arguments are pretty persuasive if you're not careful, and you might be halfway convinced that the writer is on his side. This is important, because at first glance it's hard to imagine why a supernaturally intelligent being would commit himself to a hopeless battle against his all-powerful Creator.  Because of this, I at least always have the sneaking misgiving that the Devil must be a moron, at least when you consider things practically.  This movie presents him as a being who can be pretty convincing, almost idealistic, in his reasons for rebelling, though no doubt he's not being completely honest.As far as the people who keep putting down Keanu Reeves, I agree with the writer of the primary commentary that he is an underrated actor and wrongly maligned.  True, he is not an a par with Pacino, but he certainly can hold his own with him.  There must be something there, because he's been in many movies with some of the best actors in the business, and always comes across just fine.  For those people who have some axe to grind against him I have the following advice:  Don't go to see his movies!In summary, I really loved this movie, even more than eating large quantities of chocolate.",Null,1,2,18 November 2003
