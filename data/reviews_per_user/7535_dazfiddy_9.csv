The Monuments Men," Totally unmemorable
","It is amazing that World War Two can still throw up interesting subjects for a movie such as this one. Allied teams sent into liberated Europe to claim art stolen by the Nazis. Director George Clooney has assembled a great cast including Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Cate Blanchett and Hugh Bonnevile. The movie does not work. There is no drama, no tension or even a scene that will linger in your memory. It is a very mediocre film. Maybe its a lack of interesting characters, or the poor script or the light hearted tone. It failed to click with me, and I love war movies! Luckily for me I watched it on blu ray rather at the cinema. The extras on the DVD confirmed what an interesting topic this is, and that Clooney's film failed to make it.",4,9,10,21 November 2018
Argo," Fascinating story about a little known rescue mission
","Ben Affleck proves yet again,that he is a gifted director and that his previous offerings (Gone Baby Gone and The Town)were not flukes. Both films were set in Affleck's native city of Boston. His latest film, Argo, tells the story of the rescue by the CIA of American diplomats in Iran during the Hostage Crisis.We are give a crash course in Iranian History taking us up to the events in 1979 when the US Embassy was stormed in November of that year.The diplomats, six of them, hid in the Canadian Ambassador's residence, while the main hostages were held in the American Embassy. Affleck, plays CIA agent, Tony Menendez,who is tasked with getting them out of Iran. His plan is so outrageous that it could have come from an episode of Mission Impossible. Why not have the diplomats pose as a film crew making a sci-fi movie called....Argo? For this, Menendez travels to Hollywood where he creates a fake production with media notices, a producer and a script.The previous ideas for a rescue floated by the CIA were even more far fetched.Comic relief is provided by Alan Arkin as the movie producer who realises what is at stake, and yet treats the whole thing with a world weary movie mogul air. Arkin gets the bulk of the film's funny lines. There are lots of visual gags about Hollywood especially about the poor Star Wars knock offs that Hollywood produced in the late 1970s.We are also given snippets of the tension between the CIA , the State Department and Jimmy Carter's White House.Affleck assembles a huge cast of talented actors including Tate Donovan,Clea Duvall,Bryan Cranston and John Goodman and gets great performances. He also shoots his film with a grainy stock to give it that 1970s feel. The crowd scenes depicting the stormy of the Embassy compound are well done. You can smell the panic inside the building as the staff decide to burn all the classified papers.Well done,Mr Affleck. Oscars nominations ahoy???",8,1,4,21 October 2012
Public Enemies," Disappointing Gangster movie
","Michael Mann has demonstrated that he can make good crime dramas like Heat,Collateral and Miami Vice. He adds a slickness that few directors can match. Unfortunately, his latest offering ,Public Enemies falls well short.The film centres on the pursuit of John Dillinger by the FBI as the crux of the film.Dillinger is played by Johhny Depp, a charismatic actor of some talent.His FBI nemesis is Melvin Purvis(Christian Bale) who is charged by J Edgar Hoover to catch Dillinger and his gang of bank robbers.The problem with the film is that is not sure what it is. Is it story about John Dillinger and his duel with Purvis or is it a look at the rise of the FBI? There is also the relationship between Dillinger and Billie Frechette, a totally wasted Marion Cotillard.We learn almost nothing about their love affair and what was the attraction.The film sets no context about the hatred of the banks during the Depression nor the rise of the celebrity gangster like Dillinger,Alvin Karpis, Bonnie and Clyde.So much is left unexplained.The shoot outs as expected are great , with copious use Tommy guns.You are constantly reminded of that classic shoot out in Heat,which was a far superior film.No one can shoot a film better at night than Michael Man.Sadly, there is not enough in this film to make it compelling.With the talent involved, you expected something special,Public Enemies does not deliver.",5,1,5,4 July 2009
A Bridge Too Far," An all time classic war too
","It is rare that Hollywood makes a war movie about a disastrous campaign, and yet A bridge too far is just that and more. If you love epic war movies like Midway, The Longest Day or Battle of the Bulge, then this is for you. Directed by Richard Attenborough, and scripted by William Goldman,based on Cornelius Ryan's best seller.Bridge delivers all that you need from a good war film such as courage, bravery and sacrifice. Boasting an all star cast that includes Michael Caine, James Caan,Sean Connery,Dirk Bogarde, Robert Redford and Elliot Gould, this is a must see.The film focuses on the attempt by the Allies in 1944 to end the war by capturing key bridges in Holland and then advancing into Germany. It was an audacious plan, devised by Field Marshall Montgomery who believed that the Germans were near collapse. The plan, named Operation Market Garden, required a three airborne divisions to capture and hold the bridges long enough so that a mechanised army can relieve them. It was the largest airborne drop in history. It would have been an amazing victory had it succeeded.Needless to say, it all goes terribly wrong. The film does not hold back in depicting the mistakes of the Allies from bad intelligence, massive egos ,poor planning and down right incompetence. The film also shows the thinking from the German side, and also we get the point of view of he Dutch people.My favourite scene is the attempt by Major Julian Cook, played by Redford to capture Nijmegen Bridge by a river crossing. The paratroopers are subjected to merciless barrage of machine guns and mortars by the Germans.A mark of a classic is that you can watch time and again, and still be entertained.Bridge delivers in spades.",8,2,4,17 April 2012
American Sniper," Gripping character study of a warrior
","What happens to a man who is exposed to constant violence?Does his humanity begin to erode? These are some of the issue raised in American Sniper directed by Clint Eastwood. Bradley Cooper plays Chris Kyle, the true story of a Navy Seal sniper who served four tours in Iraq. Kyle proves himself a skilled marksman, who acts as a guardian angel for the Marines by picking off threats like potential suicide bombers. Kyle becomes a living legend.Cooper plays Kyle as a dedicated killer who loves his team, and is a patriot.He is certain of his mission and the wider cause that has brought the United States to Iraq. This is not a movie that asks big questions like The Green Zone or Fair Game. We also see the toll that the war takes on Kyle's family. His wife,Taya as portrayed by Sienna Miller, finds it harder to re- connect with him.Can a man be the same person after he returns from a war zone? Miller is a revelation, as the spouse who becomes increasingly frustrated with her husband.The battle scenes are well done as you would expect from the man who directed Flags of our Fathers.In one scene, Kyle comes very close to killing a child. You can feel his relief when he does not have to pull the trigger.Eastwood's film seems to be saying that no matter how macho you are and no matter how battle hardened, you can never be whole again.",8,57,117,17 January 2015
Forrest Gump," A real classic for the 1990s
","I have just watched Forrest Gump again on DVD,and it still stands up after all these years!Tom Hanks is truly amazing as the simple man who remains true to himself.It is an amazing performance, as he truly understands the character, this is not a moron but a man who lives his life by basic truths, from which he never deviates.The first time I saw this film in 1994, I dismissed it as baby boomer crap.I missed the emotional content that gives the film its real power.Forget about the ground breaking computer generated imagery, its the performances and the story that lifts this film above the ordinary.Tom Hanks truly deserved his second Oscar for what was a truly memorable role.Just watch the scenes just after Jenny leaves him near the end.He does not need say anything.Robin Wright has the smaller role as the love of his life.We watch her journey throughout the film. It is deeply moving as she recognises that walking on the wild side will not bring her happiness.If I have one complaint about this film, it is that Jenny is almost used as a cipher to depict the drug culture and the permissive society of the 1960s and 1970s.Anyone who is conservative in their politics, could be comforted by the arc of Jenny's character including her demise.Gary Sinise is terrific as Lt Dan Taylor.He is good in so many films like Ransom,Snake Eyes and Apollo 13.Here he portrays a complex character who evolves in much the same way as Tom Cruise in Born on the Fourth of July.It is an emotional film about love and its various incarnations, that at the heart of this movie.Forrest's love never changes even though his country changes all around him.",8,2,5,5 January 2008
The Duchess," Good film
","Keira Knightley proves yet again that she can do costume drama in her latest film. She plays Georgiana, the Duchess of Devonshire, who was also an ancestor of Diana Spencer(Princes Diana).Georgiana married the Duke(Ralph Fiennes) in 18th England,a wealthy aristocrat.The deal, and it is a deal, is that she provide him with a male heir.Geogiana became a fashion icon and a celebrity in high society.She was also quite a fun loving character who liked gambling and attending the theatre.We are given plenty of references to the marriage of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer.Georgiana marries a man who is unable to show his emotions, and is determined to have a male heir to carry on the bloodline.Her happiness is way down the list of priorities.The film makes it clear that women,including aristos like Georgiana were regarded as second class citizens.With no money, no votes or sexual freedom, they had were required to look pretty and breed children for the men who formed the ruling class. Once the Duchess decides to gain her own happiness, the Duke makes sure that he takes that away.The Duchess also shows that unconventional lifestyles were in existence long before the 1960s.The Duke moves his mistress,Lady Elizabeth Foster,played by Hayley Attwell into his home.Keira Knightley carries the film as the central character, with great support from Ralph Fiennes,Charlotte Rampling and Dominic Cooper.Miss Knightley has got that star quality camera that any movie star must have.The girl can act ! A very entertaining film about the aristocracy in Britain before the Industrial Revolution.",7,4,10,10 September 2008
Gran Torino," A gem of a movie.
","You have to give Clint his due, he is one of the few stars who has emerged from the 1950s who is still a box office draw today.He may not have the acting skill of a Brando or a Newman, but he knows what he's good at and how it translates on screen. He fully delivers in his latest film, Gran Torino.Walt Kowalski(Clint) is Korean War veteran, who lives in Detroit.He is a bitter old veteran. When we first meet him,he is at the funeral of his wife. We see him with his two sons, and their families. He has very little connection with them.One of the few white faces still living in his neighbourhood, Walt gets involved with Thao, who is being threatened by a local gang. Thao is from Hmong,the people relocated to America from Laos .For Walt, who is a racist and makes no attempt to hide it, the sight of these immigrants are too much for him. He uses words like 'gooks' and 'fishheads'.One of Walt's prized possessions is his Ford Gran Torino. He never drives it, but he keeps it in mint condition. The gang urge Thao to steal the car as part of his initiation into the gang.Walt attempts to save Thao from the gang and adopting him as his surrogate son.He may be a racist, but Walt reclaims his humanity.Why is the film called Gran Torino?The car is a symbol of old fashioned values,values that Walt sees disappearing. It is also symbolic of an America that is in decline.Walt growls at everything, from his granddaughter texting in church to his son driving a Japanese car.This is Clint's commentary on modern America. He despises, the lack of respect for tradition,the decline of patriotism, political correctness,wiggas and gang culture.This could easily be Dirty Harry in 2008, railing against the current orthodoxy.We still get the typical Eastwood humour and that magnetic screen presence.Clint still has the magic, even at 78 years old.",8,2,6,9 March 2009
There Will Be Blood," A Damn good film-almost a classic
","This film is so good, that you can watch read it a number of ways. It can seen as a critique of capitalism, especially the rise of the oil barons in the early twentieth century. You can also view it from a Biblical angle: What happens when you gain the whole world, and lose your soul? Daniel Day-Lewis proves that he is in a class by himself. His portrayal of Daniel Plainview, the greedy oil tycoon is amazing.Cunning,ruthless and vengeful, this is not a likable man.We watch this forceful man rise from oil prospector to millionaire, brushing aside anyone who will impede him.The only person who comes close is Eli Sunday(Paul Dano) a Preacher who has his own agenda and tries to challenge Plainview's dominance.You know that sooner or later, these two men are going to have a showdown.My only quibble is that final scene when Day-Lewis seems to go over the top. Having said that, he more than deserved his second Best Actor Oscar for this powerhouse role.",7,1,3,6 July 2008
