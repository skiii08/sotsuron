The Blair Witch Project," I have never been so disturbed by a movie
","I feel that anyone who says 'oh, it just wasn't scary, it was lousy and boring' must be void of any imagination, void of any ability to 'live with' a movie, and I pity them.I saw the movie yesterday, and am still in such a shock that all I can say is I was so much in a state of fear/anxiety/panic that I cried. No conventional horror movie has ever done this to me. I barely slept last night.The final image will probably haunt me for the rest of my life. It infuriates me beyond belief that there are actually people claiming 'there was no ending'/'the ending made no sense' and so on.Granted, you need to have some suspension of belief, but please, see this movie with an open mind, try to forget all the hype, and it may well prove to be one of the most unsettling experiences ever.",10,1,2,10 November 1999
