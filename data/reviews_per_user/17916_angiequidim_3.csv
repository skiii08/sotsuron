Skyfall," Good story line and good action sequences. Bond is updated for the new generation!
","By Miguel Herrera www.thatsmye.com Bond and Eve are on a mission to retrieve a hard drive containing the undercover identities of NATO agents, who have infiltrated terrorist organizations. A chase ensues and Bond is right on the unknown individuals tail, and eventually the chase ends up on top of a moving train and a fight begins. Eve gets ahead of the train and prepares her gun to take down the unknown individual if necessary. She gets the call to take him down but,unfortunately, she misses and hits Bond instead. A search for Bond begins but he is never found and is declared dead. Due to the mishap of unknown individual getting away with the hard drive, MI6 is under investigation and M comes under political pressure to retire due to this. Now M must do everything in her power to apprehend the person who stole the hard drive.I was very impressed with this movie it had everything a Bond movie is known for, quite a bit of action, some drama, suspense and sophistication that only Bond can deliver. The overall pace of the movie was a bit slow in the beginning for my taste but it picked up after about 40 minutes. I enjoyed the story which was all about revenge and redemption for both M and Bond. M trying to redeem herself after that mishap with the lost hard drive, and Bond coming back after being declared dead has to prove that being an agent isn't just a young mans game. Personally I thought M (Judi Dench) was phenomenal in this role really liked her character and the things she has to go through. Much like in the past 2 movies more so in the first one, you got to see the vulnerable side of Bond one that has been beaten and must prove to himself and to others that he still has what it takes to be a MI6 agent.I thought there was enough action to satisfy my taste and make it feel like a Bond movie, from him being stealthy to just going out with guns blazing. I also enjoyed Daniel Craig as Bond once again, and I think he simply is Bond and he brings the character to life quite well. I also thought Silva (Javier Bardem) did an excellent job as the villain in the film. I especially enjoyed the interactions he had with both M and Bond throughout the movie. As far as the action scenes are concerned I enjoyed them immensely, I thought they were excellent and somewhat over the top, kinda what I've come to expect a Bond movie to be. I thought the opening sequence was awesome, it was a cool chase scene that ended up with Bond falling off a train and into a river. Overall I thought the action was good and not too much, but enough when necessary.While I did enjoy the movie I did think the movie started off a bit slow, but other than that it was a good Bond movie with a good story line. All the characters were great in this movie, but Judi Dench stole the spotlight in one of her best performances portraying M. I enjoyed watching Javier Bardem as the villain, I thought he was both witty and funny, and his first encounter with Bond will make you laugh. The action sequences were great and complemented the movie very well. Overall while this movie takes a while to pick up, it does, and it ends on a high note.",9,1,8,23 November 2012
Rise of the Guardians," I would see this again in a second I'm already making plans to take friends to it
","Sean McQuillan www.thatsmye.com Dreamworks animation has not quite had the success rate of Pixar, but if Rise of the Guardians is any example of where they're heading, they're on a good path. RotG is like a League of Extraordinary Gentlemen of children's fables that band together to protect the children of the world from fear itself. Led by Santa Claus, the Guardians include the Tooth Fairy, The Easter Bunny, and the Sandman. An old evil that thrives on the fear of children is returning, and the powers that be have chosen a new guardian to rise to the occasion, Jack Frost. Can Frost rise to legendary status of his peers? Will he be able to dispel fear and bring joy to the children? It's an amazing ride through fantastic worlds to find out.The design of the characters really drew me into this one, when I first saw the trailer. Santa is an enormous, tattooed, urshanka wearing, sword wielding, commander of Yetis. Tooth Fairy is designed after a beautiful humming bird, as are her fairy minions. The villain has a sleek design with piercing eyes. I was not disappointed. This movie is beautiful. The set pieces are brilliant and epic, yet subtle. You can see the influence of Pan's Laberynth Director, Gillermo Del Torro, who was an executive producer here. The animation is great, and makes real good use of the 3D, which I fully admit I normally dislike.The voice casting is superb, Chris Pine holds his own as Jack Frost, while Alec Balwin is almost unrecognizable as North (Santa). The biggest highlight for me is Jude Law as the villain. You can hear a snippet of him in the trailer. The children in the room have young voice actors, but are all greats.The review might seem a little unbalanced, but I'm really struggling to come up with any big flaws. It is a great film for children and adults alike. Some people say it might be too scary for kids, but at its core the movie is about overcoming fear. It is an epic romp. It's not really a Christmas movie, as much as a winter movie. Go see it! Here's a trailer and character posters to hold you off until it's released.",10,50,65,23 November 2012
Lincoln," Lincoln is thoughtful, poignant
","Review by Ray Silveyra www.thatsmye.com Lincoln is thoughtful,poignant, and with our nation at one of its most important elections,this is a movie that is relevant and important. Though it may not reach the heights to be spoken in association with Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, with Lincoln, Steven Spielberg adds yet another classic to an unprecedented cannon.Based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's biography, Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, the film follows the President toward the end of the civil war, as he tries to gain passage of the 13th amendment, abolishing slavery. The Civil War is ultimately a backdrop to the struggles Lincoln faces with a divided Congress, an impatient cabinet, and a family that is often treated second to a nation.The film features a stellar cast that includes Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, Tommy Lee-Jones, Joseph Gordin Levitt, and David Strathairn. The entire cast is utterly superb in their roles, but Tommy Lee-Jones (as Thaddeus Stevens) absolutely commands the screen, delivering his lines with a whipping intensity and a demeanor that is quiet, controlled and critically believable Look, we all know the outcome, we know that the amendment passes, but Spielberg manages to enthrall his audience not from the passage of the amendment but rather, the reasoning behind the amendment. Spielberg so perfectly captures the political arena, that the audience will, without a doubt, be more emotionally invested in its story than any other thing on screen, Lincoln included. Unfortunately, when the movie isn't dealing with the political plot, it tends to drag, only to be picked up again by the political battle that controls the movie. Consequently, when the political plot is resolved, it is difficult to keep further interest in a remaining story that feels secondary and undeveloped. Sadly, yet appropriately, Lincoln dies with the resolution of the political plot. The film's greatest strength, and perhaps its biggest downfall, is that the Amendment, as it was in real life, is bigger than Lincoln himself.At a time when our nation is deciding its next president and debating the validity of equal marriage, affirmative action, workplace equality, and undocumented immigration, it is appropriate that Lincoln, with the grandeur of Grade-A performances and the epic quality one would expect from a Spielberg film, is outshone by a political battle that is important to know and relevant to apply in our present. In one of his most fragile moments, Daniel Day-Lewis's Abraham Lincoln, asks, 'Do we choose to be born? Or do we fit into the time we're born into?' The film may seem self-righteous to some, yet to most it will be evident that Lincoln is an intense, near-perfect film, that, now, more than ever, necessarily fits into the time is it born into.",8,10,28,12 November 2012
