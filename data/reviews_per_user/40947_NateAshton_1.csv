Source Code," 'I would make those few seconds count'
","Wow! Duncan Jones is AMAZING! In Source Code, he manages to keep a energetic and complex plot rolling, while bringing to light the very real question, of, 'If you only had a short amount of time left to live, would you spend it trying to save yourself, or would you try to impact someone else's life in a positive way?' The story is centered around Capt. Coulter Stevens {Jake Gyllenhaal}, a helicopter pilot who wakes up on a train in Chicago in the body of another man, sitting opposite of a woman named Christina {Michelle Monaghan}who acts as if she and him know each other. Then the train explodes and Stevens wakes up inside a machine called the Source Code. He then finds out that he is part of a program designed by a man named Dr. Rutledge {Jeffrey Wright}, to enter the last eight minutes of another man's conscience, thus allowing Stevens eight minutes to try and find the bomb and the bomber that are on board the Chicago train. Find the bomb, find the bomber, prevent another major catastrophe in the heart of downtown Chicago. With a great script, an awesome cast, and an amazing director, Source Code is a thriller you must see! 'What would you do, if you only had eight minutes to live?'",9,0,1,17 April 2011
